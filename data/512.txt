RETIREMENT OF JUSTICE BLACKMUN

Supreme Court of the United States

THURSDAY, JUNE 30, 1994

Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Blackmun,
Justice Stevens, Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy,
Justice Souter, Justice Thomas, and Justice Ginsburg.

The Chief Justice said:
And we must also note with sadness that this is the last
session in which our friend and colleague Harry Blackmun
will be with us, and on this occasion we have sent Justice
Blackmun the following letter which I will now read:

Supreme Court of the United States,

Chambers of The Chief Justice,

Washington, D. C., June 21, 1994.

Dear Harry,
Your colleagues are sad that you have chosen to retire
from the Court. You came here twenty-four years ago--
longer ago than any of us--and have served with no less than
sixteen different members.

Your opinions have covered a wide range of the issues that
come before the Court. You are undoubtedly best known
for having authored the Court's opinion in Roe v. Wade in
1973, but that distinction should not obscure the many other
important issues on which you have spoken for the Court.
Your contributions have not been limited to signed opinions,
but include as well your wise counsel in our Conference.

viii RETIREMENT OF JUSTICE BLACKMUN
And, though it has nothing to do with our judicial work,you have made a major improvement in the cultural life of

the Court with your sponsorship of our biennial musicalperformances.

We shall miss you--especially if you go through with yourpresent plans to move to Florida. But whether in Washington or Jacksonville, we wish you the very best.

Sincerely,

William H. Rehnquist
John Paul Stevens
Sandra Day O'Connor
Antonin Scalia
Anthony M. Kennedy
David H. Souter
Clarence Thomas
Ruth Bader Ginsburg

Justice Blackmun said:
I suppose I should read my response to the cordial letterthat has just been written and here it is:

Supreme Court of the United States,
Chambers of Justice Harry A. Blackmun,Washington, D. C., June 22, 1994.

My Dear Colleagues:
Your cordial letter brightens my day.It has been a privilege for me to have been on the Federal

Bench for over three decades and on this Court for over two.I have sat now with 17 Justices of the Court, about 15% of
all those who have served since 1790. And I have had theprivilege of knowing eight others whose service was complete before I arrived here. You and the ones before youwho have departed since 1970 have provided pleasant friendship, professional inspiration, imagination, instruction, and asense of worthwhile service in a common devotion to our
imperfect but beloved country. At times, our task has been

512bv$$vii 12-04-97 11:01:20 PGT * frt

ixRETIREMENT OF JUSTICE BLACKMUN
heavy, the hours long, and the stress substantial. Byron re-minded us that `the Court is a very small organization for

the weight it carries.' But always there was an awarenessthat we were all in this together, and that the system seemed
to be working. And there was the conviction that this wasthe way it was meant to be and that it would work out all
right. What a comfort that has been, and what a comfort ithas been to work with each of you and with others of our
predecessors who have deliberated around our conferencetable.

As an old canoeist myself, I share Bill Douglas' vivid andeloquent description of our work together, the occasional
long and strenuous portages, and the last night's and the lastmorning's campfires, as he set it forth in his retirement letter of November 14, 1975. 423 U. S. ix. It is so true thatthe Justices of the Court are `strangers at the beginning but
almost invariably are close friends at the end.' So it wasfor him. So it was for me. And so it has been, I think, for
each of us. We have been gathered from different placesand through the influence of different forces. That is one of
the remarkable aspects of this Court and of the experienceof service upon it.

Let us hope that, in the years far down the line, whenhistory eventually places us in such perspective as we deserve, it at least will be able to say: `They did their best anddid acceptably well.' If that comes to be said, it is because
of your cooperation, your understanding, your patience, andyour acknowledgment that ours is a common, not an individual, task, and that we strove, in our small ways and withour limited capabilities, for the righting of injustices of both
ancient and current origins. For all this, I am grateful.

Sincerely,

Harry

CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 1993

ROMANO v. OKLAHOMA
certiorari to the court of criminal appealsof oklahoma

No. 92-9093. Argued March 22, 1994--Decided June 13, 1994
During the sentencing phase of petitioner's first-degree murder trial in

Oklahoma, the State introduced a copy of the judgment and death sentence he had received during an earlier trial for another murder. The
jury ultimately found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed
the mitigating circumstances, and imposed a second death sentence on
petitioner. In affirming, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals acknowledged that the evidence of petitioner's prior death sentence was
irrelevant to determining the appropriateness of the second death sentence, but held that admission of the evidence did not violate the Eighth
and Fourteenth Amendments under Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S.
320, or so infect the sentencing determination with unfairness as to
amount to a denial of due process.

Held: The admission of evidence regarding petitioner's prior death sentence did not amount to constitutional error. Pp. 6-14.

(a) Admission of the evidence at issue did not contravene the principle
established in Caldwell, supra, at 342 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment), because the evidence did not affirmatively
mislead the jury regarding its role in the sentencing process so as to
diminish its sense of responsibility for the capital sentencing decision.
Such evidence was not false at the time it was admitted and did not
even pertain to the jury's sentencing role. The trial court's instructions, moreover, emphasized the importance of that role and never con1

Syllabus
veyed or intimated that the jury could shift its responsibility in sentencing. Pp. 6-10.

(b) Although the evidence in question may have been irrelevant, the
jury's consideration of it did not render the sentencing proceeding so
unreliable that it violated the Eighth Amendment under Lockett v. Ohio,
438 U. S. 586, 604 (plurality opinion), and Woodson v. North Carolina,
428 U. S. 280, 305. That the evidence may have been irrelevant as a
matter of state law does not render its admission federal constitutional
error. See Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 67. Dawson v. Delaware,
503 U. S. 159, 167, and Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 885, are plainly
inapposite, since petitioner does not argue that admission of the evidence allowed the jury to consider, in aggravation, constitutionally protected conduct. Johnson v. Mississippi, 486 U. S. 578, 586, 590, n. 8, is
also inapposite, since it is perfectly consistent with the Court of Criminal Appeals' approach and does not stand for the proposition that the
mere admission of irrelevant and prejudicial evidence requires the overturning of a death sentence. This Court declines petitioner's request
to fashion a federal code of general evidentiary rules, under the guise
of interpreting the Eighth Amendment, which would supersede state
rules in capital sentencing proceedings. Pp. 10-12.

(c) Introduction of the evidence in question did not so infect the trial
with unfairness as to render the jury's imposition of the death penalty
a denial of due process under the analytical framework set forth in Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U. S. 637, 643. Presuming that the trial
court's instructions were followed, they did not offer the jurors any
means by which to give effect to the irrelevant evidence of petitioner's
prior sentence, and the relevant evidence presented by the State was
sufficient to justify the imposition of the death sentence in this case.
Even assuming that the jury disregarded its instructions and allowed
the irrelevant evidence to influence its decision, a finding of fundamental
unfairness on the basis of this record would be an exercise in speculation, rather than reasoned judgment, since it seems equally plausible
that the evidence in question could have influenced the jurors either to
impose, or not to impose, the death sentence. Pp. 12-14.

847 P. 2d 368, affirmed.

brief was Sandra D. Howard, Assistant Attorney General.*

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

Petitioner murdered and robbed Roger Sarfaty in 1985.In 1986, he murdered and robbed Lloyd Thompson. Petitioner was tried separately for each murder. The Thompsontrial occurred first, and an Oklahoma jury found petitioner
guilty and sentenced him to death. Petitioner was thentried for the Sarfaty murder. A different Oklahoma jury
found him guilty and sentenced him to death. During thesentencing phase of the Sarfaty trial, the State introduced a
copy of the judgment and sentence petitioner received forthe Thompson murder. Petitioner contends that the admission of evidence regarding his prior death sentence under-mined the Sarfaty jury's sense of responsibility for determining the appropriateness of the death penalty, in violation ofthe Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. We disagree and
hold that the admission of this evidence did not amount toconstitutional error.

In Oklahoma, capital trials are bifurcated into guilt andsentencing phases. Okla. Stat., Tit. 21, $ 701.10 (1981). The

4 ROMANO v. OKLAHOMA

Opinion of the Court
sentencing jury may not impose a death sentence unless itunanimously finds the existence of at least one statutory aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt, and thatany aggravating circumstances outweigh any mitigating
circumstances. $ 701.12. At the sentencing phase of theSarfaty trial, the State sought to prove four aggravating circumstances, two of which are relevant to our decision: (1)that petitioner had been previously convicted of a violent
felony; and (2) that petitioner would constitute a continuingthreat to society.

1

In attempting to establish these two aggravating cir-cumstances, the State introduced evidence relating to the

Thompson murder. The State presented testimony byThompson's neighbor concerning her observations the day of
the murder, Thompson's autopsy report, and photographsand fingerprints showing that the defendant in the Thompson case was in fact petitioner. The State also introduced acopy of the judgment and sentence from the Thompson murder conviction. That document revealed that petitioner hadbeen convicted of first-degree murder and had been sentenced to death. App. 5-6. It also showed, and the trialcourt told the jury, that petitioner planned on appealing from
the judgment and sentence. Id., at 7. Petitioner's counselobjected to the admission of the document. He argued that,
regardless of the admissibility of the evidence of petitioner'sconviction, the death sentence petitioner received was not
proper for the jury to consider. The trial court overruledthe objection and admitted the evidence. Petitioner later
presented evidence in mitigation.Before closing arguments, the trial court instructed the
jury. It identified the four aggravating circumstances theState sought to establish and told the jury that "[i]n determining which sentence you may impose in this case, you may

1 The other two aggravating circumstances were that the murder was
especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel, and that it was committed to avoid
lawful arrest or prosecution.

5Cite as: 512 U. S. 1 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
consider only those [four] circumstances." Id., at 9. Thecourt then identified the 17 mitigating circumstances offered

by petitioner. The jury was instructed that it could notimpose the death penalty unless it unanimously found that
one or more aggravating circumstances existed beyond a rea-sonable doubt and that any such circumstances outweighed
any mitigating circumstances. Id., at 8-12. In closing, thecourt admonished the jury:

"You are the determiner of the facts. The impor-tance and worth of the evidence is for you to decide.
"I have made rulings during the second part of thistrial. In ruling, I have not in any way suggested to
you, nor intimidated [sic] in any way, what you shoulddecide. I do not express any opinion whether or not
aggravating circumstances or mitigating circumstancesdid or did not exist, nor do I suggest to you in any way
the punishment to be imposed by you."You must not use any kind of chance in reaching a
verdict, but you must rest it on the belief of each of youwho agrees with it." Id., at 13.

The jury found that all four aggravating circumstances ex-isted and that they outweighed the mitigating circumstances.
It accordingly imposed a death sentence. Petitioner ap-pealed. While his appeal in this case was pending, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals overturned petitioner'sconviction for the Thompson murder. See

Romano v. Okla-homa, 827 P. 2d 1335 (1992) (Romano I). The Oklahoma

Court of Criminal Appeals held that petitioner's trial shouldhave been severed from that of his codefendant; it therefore
reversed and remanded for a new trial.2In his appeal in this case, petitioner argued, inter alia,

that the trial court erred by admitting evidence of his convic-tion and sentence for the Thompson murder. He asserted

2 On retrial for the Thompson murder, petitioner was again convicted
and again sentenced to death. Brief for Petitioner 31, n. 11.

6 ROMANO v. OKLAHOMA

Opinion of the Court
that it was improper to admit the conviction because it wasnot final at the time of admission, and it had since been overturned. He also contended that the evidence of his deathsentence in the Thompson case impermissibly reduced the
Sarfaty sentencing jury's sense of responsibility for its decision, in violation of Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320(1985).

The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. 847P. 2d 368, 390 (1993)

(Romano II). The Oklahoma court
concluded that the evidence regarding petitioner's priordeath sentence was irrelevant. Because the jury was properly instructed in this case, however, it could not be said
"that the jury in any way shifted the responsibility for their
decision or considered their decision any less significant than
they would otherwise." Ibid. The Court of Criminal Appeals further held that the admission of the evidence "did
not so infect the sentencing determination with unfairness
as to make the determination to impose the death penalty a
denial of due process." Id., at 391.

Petitioner sought our review, and we granted certiorari,
limited to the following question: "Does admission of evidence that a capital defendant already has been sentenced to
death in another case impermissibly undermine the sentencing jury's sense of responsibility for determining the appropriateness of the defendant's death, in violation of the Eighth
and Fourteenth Amendments?" 510 U. S. 943 (1993). We
now affirm.

It is helpful to begin by placing petitioner's challenge
within the larger context of our Eighth Amendment death
penalty jurisprudence. We have held that the Eighth
Amendment's concern that the death penalty be both appropriate and not randomly imposed requires the States to
perform two somewhat contradictory tasks in order to impose the death penalty.

First, States must properly establish a threshold below
which the penalty cannot be imposed. McCleskey v. Kemp,

512us1$66H 01-08-98 12:19:25 PAGES OPINPGT

7Cite as: 512 U. S. 1 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
481 U. S. 279, 305 (1987). To ensure that this threshold ismet, the "State must establish rational criteria that narrow

the decisionmaker's judgment as to whether the circum-stances of a particular defendant's case meet the threshold."
Ibid. As we stated in Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U. S. 231
(1988), "[t]o pass constitutional muster, a capital sentencingscheme must `genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible

for the death penalty and must reasonably justify the imposi-tion of a more severe sentence on the defendant compared to
others found guilty of murder.' " Id., at 244 (quoting Zantv.

Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 877 (1983)). In this respect, a
State's sentencing procedure must suitably direct and limit
the decisionmaker's discretion " `so as to minimize the risk of
wholly arbitrary and capricious action.' " Id., at 874 (quoting Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 189 (1976)). Petitioner
does not allege that Oklahoma's sentencing scheme fails to
adequately perform the requisite narrowing.

Second, States must ensure that "capital sentencing decisions rest on [an] individualized inquiry," under which the
"character and record of the individual offender and the circumstances of the particular offense" are considered. McCleskey, supra, at 303 (internal quotation marks omitted);
see also Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738, 748 (1990).
To this end, "States cannot limit the sentencer's consideration of any relevant circumstance that could cause it to
decline to impose the penalty. In this respect, the State
cannot channel the sentencer's discretion, but must allow it
to consider any relevant information offered by the defendant." McCleskey, supra, at 306.

Within these constitutional limits, "the States enjoy their
traditional latitude to prescribe the method by which those
who commit murder shall be punished." Blystone v. Pennsylvania, 494 U. S. 299, 309 (1990). This latitude extends to
evidentiary rules at sentencing proceedings. See, e. g.,
Gregg, supra, at 203-204 (approving "the wide scope of
evidence and argument allowed at presentence hearings"

Opinion of the Court
in Georgia). As we observed in California v. Ramos, 463U. S. 992, 999 (1983):

"In ensuring that the death penalty is not meted outarbitrarily or capriciously, the Court's principal concern
has been more with the procedure by which the Stateimposes the death sentence than with the substantive
factors the State lays before the jury as a basis forimposing death, once it has been determined that the
defendant falls within the category of persons eligiblefor the death penalty."

See also id., at 1008 ("Once the jury finds that the defendantfalls within the legislatively defined category of persons eligible for the death penalty . . . the jury then is free to con-sider a myriad of factors to determine whether death is the
appropriate punishment").

We have also held, in Caldwell v. Mississippi, that the jurymust not be misled regarding the role it plays in the sentencing decision. See 472 U. S., at 336 (plurality opinion); id., at341-342 (

O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment). The prosecutor in Caldwell, in remarks which"were quite focused, unambiguous, and strong," misled the

jury to believe that the responsibility for sentencing thedefendant lay elsewhere.

Id., at 340. The trial judge "not
only failed to correct the prosecutor's remarks, but in fact
openly agreed with them." Id., at 339.The plurality concluded that the prosecutor's remarks,

along with the trial judge's affirmation, impermissibly "mini-mize[d] the jury's sense of responsibility for determining the
appropriateness of death." Id., at 341. Such a diminution,
the plurality felt, precluded the jury from properly performing its responsibility to make an individualized determination of the appropriateness of the death penalty. Id., at 330-
331. Justice O'Connor, in her opinion concurring in part
and concurring in the judgment, identified more narrowly
the infirmity in the prosecutor's remarks: "In my view, the

Opinion of the Court
prosecutor's remarks were impermissible because they wereinaccurate and misleading in a manner that diminished the

jury's sense of responsibility." Id., at 342.As

Justice O'Connor supplied the fifth vote in Caldwell,and concurred on grounds narrower than those put forth by

the plurality, her position is controlling. See Marks v.United States, 430 U. S. 188, 193 (1977); Gregg, supra, at 169,
n. 15. Accordingly, we have since read Caldwell as "rele-vant only to certain types of comment--those that mislead
the jury as to its role in the sentencing process in a way thatallows the jury to feel less responsible than it should for the
sentencing decision." Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 168,184, n. 15 (1986). Thus, "[t]o establish a

Caldwell violation,a defendant necessarily must show that the remarks to the

jury improperly described the role assigned to the jury bylocal law." Dugger v. Adams, 489 U. S. 401, 407 (1989); see
also Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 233 (1990).Petitioner argues that Caldwell controls this case. He
contends that the evidence of his prior death sentence imper-missibly undermined the sentencing jury's sense of responsibility, in violation of the principle established in Caldwell.We disagree. The infirmity identified in

Caldwell is simplyabsent in this case: Here, the jury was not affirmatively misled regarding its role in the sentencing process. The evi-dence at issue was neither false at the time it was admitted,
nor did it even pertain to the jury's role in the sentencingprocess. The trial court's instructions, moreover, emphasized the importance of the jury's role. As the Court ofCriminal Appeals observed:

"The jury was instructed that it had the responsibilityfor determining whether the death penalty should be
imposed. . . . It was never conveyed or intimated in anyway, by the court or the attorneys, that the jury could
shift its responsibility in sentencing or that its role inany way had been minimized."

10 ROMANO v. OKLAHOMA

Opinion of the Court
We do not believe that the admission of evidence regardingpetitioner's prior death sentence affirmatively misled the

jury regarding its role in the sentencing process so as todiminish its sense of responsibility. The admission of this
evidence, therefore, did not contravene the principle established in Caldwell.That this case is different from

Caldwell only resolves part
of petitioner's challenge. In addition to raising a "Caldwell"claim, petitioner presents a more general contention: He argues that because the evidence of his prior death sentencewas inaccurate and irrelevant, the jury's consideration of it
rendered his sentencing proceeding so unreliable that the
proceeding violated the Eighth Amendment. See Lockett v.
Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604 (1978) (plurality opinion); Woodson
v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, 305 (1976). The Oklahoma
court agreed that the "evidence of the imposition of the
death penalty by another jury is not relevant in determining
the appropriateness of the death sentence for the instant
offense." Romano II, supra, at 391. That the evidence
may have been irrelevant as a matter of state law, however,
does not render its admission federal constitutional error.
See Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 67 (1991).

Some of the cases upon which petitioner relies for support,
to be sure, do hold that the Constitution bars the introduction of certain evidence at sentencing proceedings. But
these cases are plainly inapposite. Petitioner cites, for example, Dawson v. Delaware, 503 U. S. 159 (1992). There we
held that the trial court erred by admitting evidence, at
Dawson's capital sentencing proceeding, regarding Dawson's
membership in a white racist prison gang known as the
Aryan Brotherhood. See id., at 162-163. It was constitutional error, however, only because the admission violated
"Dawson's First Amendment rights." Id., at 167. Dawson
thus involved application of the principle first enunciated in
Zant: An aggravating circumstance is invalid if "it authorizes a jury to draw adverse inferences from conduct that is

11Cite as: 512 U. S. 1 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
constitutionally protected." 462 U. S., at 885. Petitionerdoes not argue that the admission of evidence regarding his

prior death sentence allowed the jury to consider, in aggra-vation, constitutionally protected conduct. Accordingly, our
decisions in Dawson and Zant do not support petitioner's
contention.Petitioner also cites

Johnson v. Mississippi, 486 U. S. 578
(1988), but it, too, is inapposite. There we reversed the im-position of Johnson's death sentence because the only evidence supporting an aggravating factor turned out to be in-valid, and because the Mississippi Supreme Court refused to
reweigh the remaining, untainted aggravating circumstances
against the mitigating circumstances. Id., at 586, 590, n. 8.
Similarly, in this case the only evidence supporting the "prior
violent felony" aggravating circumstance was the judgment
from petitioner's conviction for the Thompson murder. That
evidence, like the evidence in Johnson, was rendered invalid
by the reversal of petitioner's conviction on appeal.

Here, however, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals
struck the "prior violent felony" aggravator, reweighed the
three untainted aggravating circumstances against the mitigating circumstances, and still concluded that the death penalty was warranted. See Romano II, supra, at 389, 393-
394. The Court of Criminal Appeals' approach is perfectly
consistent with our precedents, including Johnson, where we
remanded without limiting the Mississippi Supreme Court's
authority to reweigh the remaining aggravating circumstances against the mitigating circumstances. See 486 U. S.,
at 590; id., at 591 (White, J., concurring); see also Clemons,
494 U. S., at 744-750. Contrary to petitioner's assertion,
Johnson does not stand for the proposition that the mere
admission of irrelevant and prejudicial evidence requires the
overturning of a death sentence.

Petitioner's argument, pared down, seems to be a request
that we fashion general evidentiary rules, under the guise of
interpreting the Eighth Amendment, which would govern

512us1$66H 01-08-98 12:19:25 PAGES OPINPGT
12 ROMANO v. OKLAHOMA

Opinion of the Court
the admissibility of evidence at capital sentencing proceed-ings. We have not done so in the past, however, and we will

not do so today. The Eighth Amendment does not establisha federal code of evidence to supersede state evidentiary
rules in capital sentencing proceedings. Cf. Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 824-825 (1991); Blystone, 494 U. S., at309.

Petitioner finally argues that the introduction of the evi-dence in question violated the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. It is settled that this Clause ap-plies to the sentencing phase of capital trials. See,

e. g.,
Payne, supra, at 825; Clemons, supra, at 746 ("[C]apital sentencing proceedings must of course satisfy the dictates of the
Due Process Clause").

We believe the proper analytical framework in which to
consider this claim is found in Donnelly v. DeChristoforo,
416 U. S. 637, 643 (1974). There we addressed a claim that
remarks made by the prosecutor during his closing argument
were so prejudicial as to violate the defendant's due process
rights. We noted that the case was not one in which the
State had denied a defendant the benefit of a specific constitutional right, such as the right to counsel, or in which the
remarks so prejudiced a specific right as to amount to a denial of that right. Id., at 643. Accordingly, we sought to
determine whether the prosecutor's remark "so infected the
trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a
denial of due process." Ibid. We concluded, after an "examination of the entire proceedings," that the remarks did
not amount to a denial of constitutional due process. Ibid.

The relevant question in this case, therefore, is whether
the admission of evidence regarding petitioner's prior death
sentence so infected the sentencing proceeding with unfairness as to render the jury's imposition of the death penalty
a denial of due process. See Sawyer, 497 U. S., at 244 (observing that "[t]he Caldwell rule was . . . added to [Donnelly's] existing guarantee of due process protection against

13Cite as: 512 U. S. 1 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
fundamental unfairness"); see also Darden, 477 U. S., at 178-181 (in analyzing allegedly improper comments made by

prosecutor during closing argument of guilt-innocence stageof capital trial, "[t]he relevant question is whether the prosecutors' comments `so infected the trial with unfairness as to
make the resulting conviction a denial of due process' " (quot-ing

Donnelly, supra, at 643)). Under this standard of review, we agree with the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Ap-peals that the admission of this evidence did not deprive

petitioner of a fair sentencing proceeding.The evidence that petitioner received a death sentence for
murdering Thompson was deemed irrelevant by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals. See Romano II, 847 P.
2d, at 391. However, if the jurors followed the trial court's
instructions, which we presume they did, see Richardson v.
Marsh, 481 U. S. 200, 206-207, 211 (1987), this evidence
should have had little--if any--effect on their deliberations.
Those instructions clearly and properly described the jurors'
paramount role in determining petitioner's sentence, and
they also explicitly limited the jurors' consideration of aggravating factors to the four which the State sought to prove.
Regardless of the evidence as to petitioner's death sentence
in the Thompson case, the jury had sufficient evidence to
justify its conclusion that these four aggravating circumstances existed. Although one of the aggravating circumstances proved invalid when petitioner's conviction for the
Thompson murder was overturned on appeal, the other three
remained untainted and still outweighed the mitigating circumstances. See Romano II, supra, at 389, 393-394. In
short, the instructions did not offer the jurors any means by
which to give effect to the evidence of petitioner's sentence
in the Thompson murder, and the other relevant evidence
presented by the State was sufficient to justify the imposition of the death sentence in this case.

Even assuming that the jury disregarded the trial court's
instructions and allowed the evidence of petitioner's prior

O'Connor, J., concurring
death sentence to influence its decision, it is impossible toknow how this evidence might have affected the jury. It

seems equally plausible that the evidence could have madethe jurors more inclined to impose a death sentence, or it
could have made them less inclined to do so. Either conclusion necessarily rests upon one's intuition. To hold on thebasis of this record that the admission of evidence relating

to petitioner's sentence in the Thompson case rendered peti-tioner's sentencing proceeding for the Sarfaty murder fundamentally unfair would thus be an exercise in speculation,rather than reasoned judgment.

The judgment of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Ap-peals is

Affirmed.
Justice O'Connor, concurring.
The Court today, relying in part on my opinion in Caldwell
v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320, 341 (1985), rejects petitioner's claim that the introduction of evidence of a prior death
sentence impermissibly undermined the jury's sense of responsibility. I write separately to explain why in my view
petitioner's Caldwell claim fails. The inaccuracy of the
prosecutor's argument in Caldwell was essential to my conclusion that the argument was unconstitutional. See id., at
342 ("[T]he prosecutor's remarks were impermissible because they were inaccurate and misleading in a manner that
diminished the jury's sense of responsibility"). An accurate
description of the jury's role--even one that lessened the
jury's sense of responsibility--would have been constitutional. Ibid. ("[A] misleading picture of the jury's role is
not sanctioned by [California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992
(1983),] [b]ut neither does Ramos suggest that the Federal
Constitution prohibits the giving of accurate instructions
regarding postsentencing procedures").

Accordingly, I believe that petitioner's Caldwell claim fails
because the evidence here was accurate at the time it was

admitted. Petitioner's sentencing jury was told that he hadbeen sentenced to death--and indeed he had been. Introducing that evidence is no different than providing the jury withan accurate description of a State's appellate review process.
Both may (though we can never know for sure) lessen the
jury's sense of responsibility, but neither is unconstitutional.Though evidence like that involved in this case can rise to

the level of a Caldwell violation, to do so the evidence mustbe

both inaccurate and tend to undermine the jury's sense of
responsibility. Ibid.It may well have been better practice for the State to

agree to accept petitioner's stipulation offer, or to excise thesentencing information before submitting the Judgment and
Sentence form to the jury. But under our precedents, because this evidence was accurate, I do not believe its intro-duction violated the Constitution.

Justice Blackmun, dissenting.
I join Justice Ginsburg's dissent, which persuasively
demonstrates why the admission of Romano's prior death
sentence, like the prosecutor's arguments in Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320 (1985), created an unacceptable risk of
leading the jurors to minimize the importance of their roles.
Even if this particular constitutional error were not present
in this case, I would vacate Romano's death sentence and
remand for resentencing in adherence to my view that the
death penalty cannot be imposed fairly within the constraints of our Constitution. See Callins v. Collins, 510
U. S. 1141, 1143 (1994).

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Blackmun,
Justice Stevens, and Justice Souter join, dissenting.

In Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320 (1985), this Court
overturned a capital sentence as inadequately reliable because of a statement made by the prosecutor, in closing argument at the penalty phase of the trial. The Caldwell prose512us1$66P 01-08-98 12:19:25 PAGES OPINPGT
16 ROMANO v. OKLAHOMA

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
cutor told the jury: " `[Y]our [sentencing] decision is not thefinal decision' "; " `the decision you render is automatically

reviewable by the [State] Supreme Court.' " Id., at 325-326.Responding to the issue presented in Caldwell, this Court
observed that capital sentencing jurors, required to deter-mine "whether a specific human being should die at the
hands of the State," id., at 329, are "placed in a very unfamil-iar situation and called on to make a very difficult and uncomfortable choice," id., at 333. Such jurors, the Courtnoted, might find "highly attractive" the prosecutor's suggestion that persons other than themselves would bear "re-sponsibility for any ultimate determination of death."

Id.,at 332-333.

The possibility the jury might have embraced the prosecu-tor's suggestion, the Court concluded, rendered the imposition of the death penalty inconsistent with the Constitution'srequirement of individualized and reliable capital sentencing
procedures. See id., at 323, 329-330, 340-341. Emphasiz-ing the " `truly awesome responsibility' " imposed upon capital sentencing juries, id., at 329, quoting McGautha v. Cali-fornia, 402 U. S. 183, 208 (1971), the Court held:

"[I]t is constitutionally impermissible to rest a deathsentence on a determination made by a sentencer who
has been led to believe that the responsibility for deter-mining the appropriateness of the defendant's death
rests elsewhere." 472 U. S., at 328-329.
In my view, this principle, reiterated throughout theCourt's

Caldwell opinion,1 covers the present case: The jury's

but with the appellate court which later reviews the case"); id., at 333
("[T]he uncorrected suggestion that the responsibility for any ultimate
determination of death will rest with others presents an intolerable danger that the jury will in fact choose to minimize the importance of its
role."); id., at 341 (because the State's effort "to minimize the jury's sense

consideration of evidence, at the capital sentencing phase of
petitioner Romano's trial, that a prior jury had already
sentenced Romano to death, infected the jury's life-or-death
deliberations as did the prosecutorial comments condemned
in Caldwell. Accordingly, I would vacate the death sentence imposed upon Romano and remand for a new sentencing hearing.

I

At the penalty phase of Romano's trial for the murder of
Roger Sarfaty, the prosecution sought to put before the jury
a copy of the "Judgment and Sentence" from an earlier and
unrelated prosecution. That document revealed that Romano had been convicted of the first-degree murder of Lloyd
Thompson and that he was to be executed for that crime.
Defense counsel offered to stipulate to Romano's conviction
for the Thompson murder, but objected to the jury's consideration of the death sentence. The trial court overruled defense counsel's objection and admitted the "Judgment and
Sentence" document. That document stated that Romano
had given "no good reason why [the] Judgment and Sentence
[for the murder of Thompson] should not be pronounced,"
and commanded the State's Department of Corrections "to
put the said JOHN JOSEPH ROMANO to death." App. 6.
The jury in the instant, Sarfaty murder case also sentenced
Romano to death.

During the pendency of Romano's appeal from his conviction and sentence for the Sarfaty murder, the Oklahoma
Court of Criminal Appeals vacated his conviction for the
Thompson murder. Romano v. State, 827 P. 2d 1335 (1992).
Romano urged on appeal in the Sarfaty case that, under
Caldwell v. Mississippi, it was impermissible to place before
the jury, as relevant to its deliberations whether Romano

of responsibility for determining the appropriateness of death" might have
affected the sentencing decision, the death sentence must be vacated).

should live or die, evidence that he was already under sen-tence of death.

The Oklahoma court rejected that contention and affirmedRomano's conviction and death sentence for the Sarfaty murder. 847 P. 2d 368, 390 (Okla. Crim. App. 1993). In so rul-ing, the court acknowledged that "[l]earning that the defendant had previously received a death sentence for anothermurder could diminish the jury's sense of importance of its
role and mitigate the consequences of [its] decision." Ibid.The court further recognized that "evidence of the imposition of the death penalty by another jury is not relevant indetermining the appropriateness of the death sentence for
the instant offense." Id., at 391. Nevertheless, the courtconcluded, "when the jury is properly instructed as to its
role and responsibility in making such a determination wecannot, on appellate review, conclude that the jur[ors] in any
way shifted the responsibility for their decision or con-sidered their decision any less significant than they would
otherwise." Id., at 390.2 That judgment is now before theCourt.

In Caldwell, this Court found constitutionally impermissi-ble a prosecutor's statement, at the penalty phase of a capital

trial, that the jury's decision was "not the final decision" be-cause it was "automatically reviewable." The prosecutor's
assurances were impermissible, the Court ruled, becausethey created an unacceptable risk that the jury would "minimize the importance of its role," "believ[ing] that the respon-sibility for determining the appropriateness of the defend2 The court also observed that, although death sentences attract "heightened" appellate scrutiny, "a presumption of correctness" attends the jury's
determination. 847 P. 2d, at 391.

Thompson murder and again sentenced to death. See Brief for Petitioner
31, n. 11. The State does not suggest that these events affect the question
we consider.

ant's death rest[ed] elsewhere." Caldwell, 472 U. S., at 333,329. This belief, the Court explained, is inconsistent with

the "heightened `need for reliability' " in capital sentencing.
Id., at 323, quoting Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S.
280, 305 (1976) (plurality opinion).

The risk of diminished jury responsibility was also gravein Romano's case. Revealing to the jury that Romano was

condemned to die for the Thompson murder signaled to thejurors in the Sarfaty murder case that Romano faced execution regardless of their life-or-death decision in the casebefore them. Jurors so informed might well believe that
Romano's fate had been sealed by the previous jury, and thus
was not fully their responsibility. See People v. Hope, 116
Ill. 2d 265, 274, 508 N. E. 2d 202, 206 (1986) (" `[T]he jury's
awareness of defendant's prior death sentence would diminish its sense of responsibility . . . . Assuming that defendant
was already going to be executed, the jurors may consider
their own decision considerably less significant than they
otherwise would.' "), quoting People v. Davis, 97 Ill. 2d 1, 26,
452 N. E. 2d 525, 537 (1983); West v. State, 463 So. 2d 1048,
1052-1053 (Miss. 1985) ("[I]f the jury knows that the [defendant] is already under a sentence of death it would tend to
relieve them of their separate responsibility to make that
determination.").

A juror uncertain whether to vote for death or for life
might be swayed by the knowledge that " `another jury had
previously resolved the identical issue adversely to defendant.' " Hope, 116 Ill. 2d, at 274, 508 N. E. 2d, at 206, quoting
Davis, 97 Ill. 2d, at 26, 452 N. E. 2d, at 537. Such a juror,
although "unconvinced that death is the appropriate punishment, . . . might nevertheless wish to `send a message' of
extreme disapproval for the defendant's acts," Caldwell, 472
U. S., at 331, reasoning that the defendant was already to
be executed in any event. Furthermore, jurors otherwise
inclined to hold out for a life sentence might acquiesce in a
death penalty they did not truly believe warranted. Cf. id.,

512us1$66P 01-08-98 12:19:25 PAGES OPINPGT
20 ROMANO v. OKLAHOMA

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
at 333 ("[O]ne can easily imagine that in a case in whichthe jury is divided on the proper sentence, the presence of

appellate review could effectively be used as an argumentfor why those jurors who are reluctant to invoke the death
sentence should nevertheless give in.").

Respondent State of Oklahoma correctly observes, how-ever, that evidence of a prior death sentence may not

produce a unidirectional bias toward death. Brief for Re-spondent 23. Some jurors, otherwise inclined to believe the
defendant deserved the death penalty for the crime in thecase before them, might nonetheless be anxious to avoid any
feeling of responsibility for the defendant's execution. Jurors so minded might vote for a life sentence, relying on the
prior jury's determination to secure defendant's death. See
ante, at 14. The offending prosecutorial comments in Caldwell, by contrast, created an apparently unidirectional "bias
toward a death sentence," for the appellate review that the
Caldwell jurors were encouraged to consider could occur
only if the jury sentenced the defendant to death, not if it
voted for life. 472 U. S., at 331-332. Oklahoma maintains
that Romano remains outside the Caldwell principle, because
he is unable to demonstrate that the evidence of his prior
death sentence tilted the jurors toward death.

Romano's prosecutor, at least, seems to have believed that
informing the jurors of the prior death sentence would incline them toward death, for otherwise, he probably would
not have insisted upon introducing the "Judgment and Sentence" itself, over Romano's objection, and despite Romano's
offer to stipulate to the underlying conviction. Most critically, Caldwell, as I comprehend that decision, does not require Romano to prove that the prosecutor's hunch was correct, either in Romano's case in particular or in death penalty
cases generally.

Caldwell dominantly concerns the capital sentencing jury's
awareness and acceptance of its " `awesome responsibility.' "
Id., at 341. To assure that acceptance, this Court's Eighth

Amendment jurisprudence instructs, capital sentencing pro-cedures must be especially reliable. See id., at 323 (prosecutor's comments were "inconsistent with the Eighth Amend-ment's heightened `need for reliability in the determination
that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case' "),quoting

Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S., at 305; 472U. S., at 341 (death sentence "does not meet the standard of

reliability that the Eighth Amendment requires," when itmay have been affected by the State's attempt "to minimize
the jury's sense of responsibility for determining the appro-priateness of death"). Under Caldwell's reasoning, diminution of jurors' sense of responsibility violates the EighthAmendment's reliability requirement, whether or not a defendant can demonstrate empirically that the effect of thisdiminution was to bias the jurors' judgment toward death.
According to Caldwell, if a reviewing court "cannot say" thatan effort "to minimize the jury's sense of responsibility for
determining the appropriateness of death . . . had no effecton the sentencing decision, . . . [t]he sentence of death must
. . . be vacated" as unreliable. Ibid.

III
The Court today reads Caldwell to apply only if the juryhas been "affirmatively misled regarding its role in the sentencing process." Ante, at 9. According to the Court, be-cause no information, incorrect when conveyed, was given
to the jury responsible for sentencing Romano for Sarfaty'smurder, "[t]he infirmity identified in

Caldwell is simply ab-sent in this case." Ibid.

The Court rests its rendition of Caldwell on the premisethat only a plurality of the Court's Members endorsed the
principle I regard as pivotal: Diminution of the jury's senseof responsibility "preclude[s] the jury from properly performing its [charge] to make an individualized determination ofthe appropriateness of the death penalty." See

key portions of Caldwell that the Court attributes to a plurality of four were joined by five of the eight Justices who
participated in that case. Justice O'Connor parted company with the other Members of the majority only as to a

sentence.' " Id., at 342 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), quoting id., at 336. Justice O'Connor explained that she did not read California v. Ramos,
463 U. S. 992 (1983), "to imply that the giving of nonmisleading and accurate information regarding the jury's role in
the sentencing scheme is irrelevant to the sentencing decision." 472 U. S., at 341 (emphasis deleted). It was in that
context that Justice O'Connor stated her view, quoted
ante, at 8-9, that " `the prosecutor's remarks were impermissible,' " not because they referred to the existence of postsentence review, but "because they were inaccurate and
misleading in a manner that diminished the jury's sense of
responsibility." 472 U. S., at 342.

Justice O'Connor's opinion thus appears to rest on
"grounds narrower" than those relied upon by the other
Members of the Court's Caldwell majority, see ante, at 9,
only insofar as her concurrence disavowed any implication
that the "giving of accurate instructions regarding postsentencing procedures," 472 U. S., at 342, is irrelevant or unconstitutional. The evidence of Romano's death sentence for
the murder of Thompson, however, was not information regarding postsentencing procedures Romano might pursue.
Nor, as the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals found, was
the "Judgment and Sentence" for Thompson's murder relevant to the Sarfaty jury's sentencing decision. 847 P. 2d, at

Criminal Appeals, on the trial court's instruction to the ju-rors that " `[t]he importance and worth of the evidence is for

4 In its merits brief before this Court, but not in its state-court brief or
in its brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari, the State of Oklahoma has argued that the evidence of Romano's prior sentence may have
been relevant. This belated argument does not persuade. The only authority the State cites holding that a prior death sentence may be relevant
evidence at sentencing is Commonwealth v. Beasley, 505 Pa. 279, 288, 479
A. 2d 460, 465 (1984); that case decided, purely as a matter of state statutory construction, that the term "conviction" could be taken to include the
sentence imposed for an earlier conviction.

5 In Darden, the Court rejected a Caldwell challenge to a prosecutor's

comments at the guilt phase of a capital trial. The Court observed that
the fact that the prosecutor did not make these comments at the penalty
phase "greatly reduc[ed] the chance that they had any effect at all on
sentencing." 477 U. S., at 183-184, n. 15. Further, unlike the "Judgment
and Sentence" form in Romano's case, the comments made in Darden were
not evidence, and the trial court told the jury so "several times." Finally,
the Court concluded that the prosecutor's comments would have had, "[i]f
anything, . . . the tendency to increase the jury's perception of its role,"
not diminish it. Ibid.

The Court also relies upon Dugger v. Adams, 489 U. S. 401, 407 (1989),
and Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 233 (1990). In Adams, the Court
stated that "the merit of respondent's Caldwell claim is irrelevant to our
disposition of the case." 489 U. S., at 408, n. 4. In Sawyer, the question
the Court considered was not whether a Caldwell violation had occurred,
but whether "Caldwell announced a new rule as defined by Teague v.
Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989)," i. e., whether Caldwell "was . . . dictated by
prior precedent existing at the time the [habeas petitioner's] conviction
became final." 497 U. S., at 229, 235.

view as to the appropriate punishment. Ante, at 5. TheCourt quotes the Oklahoma court's conclusion that " `[i]t was

never conveyed or intimated in any way, by the court or theattorneys, that the jury could shift its responsibility in sentencing or that its role in any way had been minimized.' "
Ante, at 9, quoting 847 P. 2d, at 390.Plainly, the trial court's instruction to consider the evidence cannot resolve the Caldwell problem in this case: The"Judgment and Sentence" form, bearing Romano's prior
death sentence, was part of the evidence the jury was toldto consider. Further, once it is acknowledged that evidence
of the prior death sentence "could diminish the jury's senseof importance of its role and mitigate the consequences of
[its] decision," 847 P. 2d, at 390, it cannot be said that thecourt or attorneys did not "conve[y] or intimat[e]" that the
jury's role was diminished. The prosecution proffered thedeath-commanding "Judgment and Sentence" as evidence,
and the trial court admitted it--over Romano's objection,and despite his offer to stipulate to the conviction. As discussed supra, at 18-21, admission of that evidence riskedleading jurors to "minimize the importance of [their] role,"
"believ[ing] that the responsibility for determining the ap-propriateness of the defendant's death rest[ed] elsewhere."
Caldwell, 472 U. S., at 333, 329. This risk was "unacceptablein light of the ease with which [it] could have been minimized." Turner v. Murray, 476 U. S. 28, 36 (1986) (opinionof White, J.).

6 The State argues that any Caldwell problems were resolved, because
the "Judgment and Sentence" form stated that Romano "gave notice of
his intention to appeal from the Judgment and Sentence herein pronounced," App. 7, and because the trial judge told the jury, when the form
was admitted, that "[Romano] has been convicted but it is on appeal and
has not become final," Tr. 45 (May 26, 1987). See Brief for Respondent
19-22. I do not find these general references to appellate review sufficient to salvage the instant death sentence, given the irrelevance of
Romano's prior sentence to legitimate sentencing considerations, see 847
P. 2d, at 391, and the ease with which all Caldwell difficulty could have
been avoided.

Permitting the jury to consider evidence that Romano wasalready under sentence of death, while that jury determined

whether Romano should live or die, threatened to "minimizethe jury's sense of responsibility for determining the appropriateness of death." Unable to say that the jury's consider-ation of Romano's prior death sentence "had no effect on the

Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. CARLTON
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 92-1941. Argued February 28, 1994--Decided June 13, 1994
As adopted in October 1986, 26 U. S. C. $ 2057 granted an estate tax deduction for half the proceeds of "any sale of employer securities by the
executor of an estate" to "an employee stock ownership plan" (ESOP).
In December 1986, respondent Carlton, acting as an executor, purchased
shares in a corporation, sold them to that company's ESOP at a loss,
and claimed a large $ 2057 deduction on his estate tax return. In December 1987, $ 2057 was amended to provide that, to qualify for the
deduction, the securities sold to an ESOP must have been "directly
owned" by the decedent "immediately before death." Because the
amendment applied retroactively, as if it were incorporated in the original 1986 provision, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) disallowed Carlton's $ 2057 deduction. The District Court entered summary judgment
against him in his ensuing refund action, rejecting his contention that
the amendment's retroactive application to his transactions violated the
Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The Court of Appeals
reversed, holding that such application was rendered unduly harsh and
oppressive, and therefore unconstitutional, by Carlton's lack of notice
that $ 2057 would be retroactively amended and by his reasonable reliance to his detriment on preamendment law.

Held: The 1987 amendment's retroactive application to Carlton's 1986

transactions does not violate due process. Under the applicable standard, a tax statute's retroactive application must be supported by a legitimate legislative purpose furthered by rational means. See, e. g., Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. R. A. Gray & Co., 467 U. S. 717,
729-730. Here, Congress' purpose in enacting the 1987 amendment was
neither illegitimate nor arbitrary. Section 2057 was originally intended
to create an incentive for stockholders to sell their companies to their
employees, but the absence of a decedent-stock-ownership requirement
resulted in the deduction's broad availability to virtually any estate, at
an estimated loss to the Government of up to $7 billion in anticipated
revenues. Thus, Congress undoubtedly intended the amendment to
correct what it reasonably viewed as a mistake in the original provision.
There is no plausible contention that it acted with an improper motive,
and its decision to prevent the unanticipated revenue loss by denying

Opinion of the Court
the deduction to those who made purely tax-motivated stock transfers
was not unreasonable. Moreover, the amendment's retroactive application is rationally related to its legitimate purpose, since Congress acted
promptly in proposing the amendment within a few months of $ 2057's
original enactment and established a modest retroactivity period that
extended only slightly longer than one year. The Court of Appeals'
exclusive focus on the taxpayer's notice and reliance held $ 2057 to an
unduly strict standard. Pp. 30-35.

Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court.
In 1987, Congress amended a provision of the federalestate tax statute by limiting the availability of a recently

added deduction for the proceeds of sales of stock to em-ployee stock-ownership plans (ESOP's). Congress provided
that the amendment would apply retroactively, as if incor-porated in the original deduction provision, which had been
adopted in October 1986. The question presented by thiscase is whether the retroactive application of the amendment
violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

28 UNITED STATES v. CARLTON

Opinion of the Court

I
Congress effected major revisions of the Internal RevenueCode in the Tax Reform Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 2085. One of

those revisions was the addition of a new estate tax provi-sion applicable to any estate that filed a timely return after
the date of the Act, October 22, 1986. The new provision,codified as 26 U. S. C. $ 2057 (1982 ed., Supp. IV),

1 granted a

deduction for half the proceeds of "any sale of employer secu-rities by the executor of an estate" to "an employee stock

ownership plan." $ 2057(b).2 In order to qualify for the de-duction, the sale of securities had to be made "before the
date on which the [estate tax] return . . . [was] required tobe filed (including any extensions)." $ 2057(c)(1).

Respondent Jerry W. Carlton, the executor of the will ofWillametta K. Day, deceased, sought to utilize the $ 2057 deduction. Day died on September 29, 1985. Her estate taxreturn was due December 29, 1986 (after Carlton had obtained a 6-month filing extension). On December 10, 1986,Carlton used estate funds to purchase 1.5 million shares of
MCI Communications Corporation for $11,206,000, at an av-erage price of $7.47 per share. Two days later, Carlton sold
the MCI stock to the MCI ESOP for $10,575,000, at an aver-age price of $7.05 per share. The total sale price thus was
$631,000 less than the purchase price. When Carlton filedthe estate tax return on December 29, 1986, he claimed a
deduction under $ 2057 of $5,287,000, for half the proceeds ofthe sale of the stock to the MCI ESOP. The deduction reduced the estate tax by $2,501,161. The parties have stipu1 Section 2057 was repealed for estates of decedents who died after
December 19, 1989. See Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989,

$ 7304(a), 103 Stat. 2352.

2 Section 2057(e) defined "employer securities" by reference to $ 409(l)

of the Code, which in turn defined the term generally as "common stock
issued by the employer (or by a corporation which is a member of the
same controlled group) which is readily tradable on an established securities market." 26 U. S. C. $ 409(l)(1) (1982 ed., Supp. IV).

lated that Carlton engaged in the MCI stock transactionsspecifically to take advantage of the $ 2057 deduction.

On January 5, 1987, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)announced that, "[p]ending the enactment of clarifying legislation," it would treat the $ 2057 deduction as available onlyto estates of decedents who owned the securities in question
immediately before death. See IRS Notice 87-13, 1987-1Cum. Bull. 432, 442. A bill to enact such an amendment to

$ 2057 was introduced in each Chamber of Congress on Feb-ruary 26, 1987. See 133 Cong. Rec. 4145 and 4293 (1987).

On December 22, 1987, the amendment to $ 2057 wasenacted. As amended, the statute provided that, to qualify
for the estate tax deduction, the securities sold to an ESOPmust have been "directly owned" by the decedent "immediately before death." Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of1987, $ 10411(a), 101 Stat. 1330-432.

3 The 1987 amendment

was made effective as if it had been contained in the statuteas originally enacted in October 1986. $ 10411(b).

The IRS disallowed the deduction claimed by Carltonunder $ 2057 on the ground that the MCI stock had not been
owned by his decedent "immediately before death." Carl-ton paid the asserted estate tax deficiency, plus interest, filed
a claim for refund, and instituted a refund action in theUnited States District Court for the Central District of California. He conceded that the estate did not qualify for thededuction under the 1987 amendment to $ 2057. He argued,
however, that retroactive application of the 1987 amendmentto the estate's 1986 transactions violated the Due Process
Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The District Court re-jected his argument and entered summary judgment in favor
of the United States.A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. 972 F. 2d 1051 (1992). The majority consid3 The amendment also required that employer securities qualifying for
the deduction must, after the sale, be allocated to participants or held for
future allocation in accordance with certain rules.

Opinion of the Court
ered two factors paramount in determining whether retroac-tive application of a tax violates due process: whether the

taxpayer had actual or constructive notice that the tax stat-ute would be retroactively amended, and whether the taxpayer reasonably relied to his detriment on preamendmentlaw. The court concluded that both factors rendered retroactive application of the amendment in this case undulyharsh and oppressive and therefore unconstitutional. Judge
Norris dissented. In his view, the 1987 amendment waswithin the wide latitude of congressional authority to legislate retroactively in regulating economic activity. Wegranted certiorari, 510 U. S. 810 (1993).

II
This Court repeatedly has upheld retroactive tax legis-lation against a due process challenge. See, e. g., United

States v. Hemme, 476 U. S. 558 (1986); United States v. Da-rusmont, 449 U. S. 292 (1981); Welch v. Henry, 305 U. S. 134
(1938); United States v. Hudson, 299 U. S. 498 (1937); Milli-ken v. United States, 283 U. S. 15 (1931); Cooper v. United
States, 280 U. S. 409 (1930). Some of its decisions havestated that the validity of a retroactive tax provision under
the Due Process Clause depends upon whether "retroactiveapplication is so harsh and oppressive as to transgress the
constitutional limitation." Welch v. Henry, 305 U. S., at 147,quoted in

United States v. Hemme, 476 U. S., at 568-569.The "harsh and oppressive" formulation, however, "does not

differ from the prohibition against arbitrary and irrationallegislation" that applies generally to enactments in the
sphere of economic policy. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. R. A. Gray & Co., 467 U. S. 717, 733 (1984). Thedue process standard to be applied to tax statutes with retroactive effect, therefore, is the same as that generally applica-ble to retroactive economic legislation:

"Provided that the retroactive application of a statute issupported by a legitimate legislative purpose furthered

31Cite as: 512 U. S. 26 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
by rational means, judgments about the wisdom of suchlegislation remain within the exclusive province of the

legislative and executive branches . . . ."To be sure, . . . retroactive legislation does have to
meet a burden not faced by legislation that has only fu-ture effects. . . . `The retroactive aspects of legislation,
as well as the prospective aspects, must meet the testof due process, and the justifications for the latter may
not suffice for the former' . . . . But that burden is metsimply by showing that the retroactive application of
the legislation is itself justified by a rational legislativepurpose."

Id., at 729-730, quoting Usery v. Turner
Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U. S. 1, 16-17 (1976).

There is little doubt that the 1987 amendment to $ 2057was adopted as a curative measure. As enacted in October

1986, $ 2057 contained no requirement that the decedent haveowned the stock in question to qualify for the ESOP proceeds deduction. As a result, any estate could claim the de-duction simply by buying stock in the market and immediately reselling it to an ESOP, thereby obtaining a potentiallydramatic reduction in (or even elimination of) the estate
tax obligation.It seems clear that Congress did not contemplate such
broad applicability of the deduction when it originallyadopted $ 2057. That provision was intended to create an
"incentive for stockholders to sell their companies to theiremployees who helped them build the company rather than
liquidate, sell to outsiders or have the corporation redeemtheir shares on behalf of existing shareholders." Joint Committee on Taxation, Tax Reform Proposals: Tax Treatmentof Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs), 99th Cong., 2d
Sess., 37 (Joint Comm. Print 1985); see also 132 Cong. Rec.14507 (1986) (statement of Sen. Long) ($ 2057 "allow[s] . . . an
executor to reduce taxes on an estate by one-half by sellingthe decedent's company to an ESOP"). When Congress initially enacted $ 2057, it estimated a revenue loss from the

32 UNITED STATES v. CARLTON

Opinion of the Court
deduction of approximately $300 million over a 5-year period.See 133 Cong. Rec. 4145 (1987) (statement of Rep. Rostenkowski); id., at 4293 (statement of Sen. Bentsen). It becameevident shortly after passage of the 1986 Act, however, that
the expected revenue loss under $ 2057 could be as much as
$7 billion--over 20 times greater than anticipated--becausethe deduction was not limited to situations in which the decedent owned the securities immediately before death. Ibid.In introducing the amendment in February 1987, Senator
Bentsen observed: "Congress did not intend for estates to beable to claim the deduction by virtue of purchasing stock in
the market and simply reselling the stock to an ESOP . . .
and Congress certainly did not anticipate a $7 billion revenue
loss." Id., at 4294. Without the amendment, Senator Bentsen stated, "taxpayers could qualify for the deductions by
engaging in essentially sham transactions." Ibid.

We conclude that the 1987 amendment's retroactive application meets the requirements of due process. First, Congress' purpose in enacting the amendment was neither illegitimate nor arbitrary. Congress acted to correct what it
reasonably viewed as a mistake in the original 1986 provision
that would have created a significant and unanticipated revenue loss. There is no plausible contention that Congress
acted with an improper motive, as by targeting estate representatives such as Carlton after deliberately inducing them
to engage in ESOP transactions. Congress, of course, might
have chosen to make up the unanticipated revenue loss
through general prospective taxation, but that choice would
have burdened equally "innocent" taxpayers. Instead, it decided to prevent the loss by denying the deduction to those
who had made purely tax-motivated stock transfers. We
cannot say that its decision was unreasonable.

Second, Congress acted promptly and established only a
modest period of retroactivity. This Court noted in United
States v. Darusmont, 449 U. S., at 296, that Congress "almost
without exception" has given general revenue statutes effec512US1 Unit: $U67 [01-06-00 06:32:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

33Cite as: 512 U. S. 26 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
tive dates prior to the dates of actual enactment. This "cus-tomary congressional practice" generally has been "confined

to short and limited periods required by the practicalities ofproducing national legislation."

Id., at 296-297. In Welch
v. Henry, 305 U. S. 134 (1938), the Court upheld a Wisconsin
income tax adopted in 1935 on dividends received in 1933.The Court stated that the " `recent transactions' " to which a

tax law may be retroactively applied "must be taken to in-clude the receipt of income during the year of the legislative
session preceding that of its enactment." Id., at 150. Here,the actual retroactive effect of the 1987 amendment extended for a period only slightly greater than one year. More-over, the amendment was proposed by the IRS in January
1987 and by Congress in February 1987, within a few months
of $ 2057's original enactment.Respondent Carlton argues that the 1987 amendment violates due process because he specifically and detrimentallyrelied on the preamendment version of $ 2057 in engaging
in the MCI stock transactions in December 1986. AlthoughCarlton's reliance is uncontested--and the reading of the
original statute on which he relied appears to have been cor-rect--his reliance alone is insufficient to establish a constitutional violation. Tax legislation is not a promise, and a
taxpayer has no vested right in the Internal Revenue Code.Justice Stone explained in

Welch v. Henry, 305 U. S., at
146-147:

"Taxation is neither a penalty imposed on the taxpayer
nor a liability which he assumes by contract. It is buta way of apportioning the cost of government among

those who in some measure are privileged to enjoy its
benefits and must bear its burdens. Since no citizen enjoys immunity from that burden, its retroactive imposition does not necessarily infringe due process . . . ."

Moreover, the detrimental reliance principle is not limited to
retroactive legislation. An entirely prospective change in

34 UNITED STATES v. CARLTON

Opinion of the Court
the law may disturb the relied-upon expectations of individu-als, but such a change would not be deemed therefore to be

violative of due process.Similarly, we do not consider respondent Carlton's lack of
notice regarding the 1987 amendment to be dispositive. In
Welch v. Henry, the Court upheld the retroactive impositionof a tax despite the absence of advance notice of the legislation. And in Milliken v. United States, the Court rejecteda similar notice argument, declaring that a taxpayer "should
be regarded as taking his chances of any increase in the taxburden which might result from carrying out the established
policy of taxation." 283 U. S., at 23.

In holding the 1987 amendment unconstitutional, the
Court of Appeals relied on this Court's decisions in Nichols
v. Coolidge, 274 U. S. 531 (1927), Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S.
142 (1927), and Untermyer v. Anderson, 276 U. S. 440 (1928).
Those cases were decided during an era characterized by
exacting review of economic legislation under an approach
that "has long since been discarded." Ferguson v. Skrupa,
372 U. S. 726, 730 (1963). To the extent that their authority
survives, they do not control here. Blodgett and Untermyer, which involved the Nation's first gift tax, essentially
have been limited to situations involving "the creation of a
wholly new tax," and their "authority is of limited value in
assessing the constitutionality of subsequent amendments
that bring about certain changes in operation of the tax
laws." United States v. Hemme, 476 U. S., at 568. Nichols
involved a novel development in the estate tax which embraced a transfer that occurred 12 years earlier. The
amendment at issue here certainly is not properly characterized as a "wholly new tax," and its period of retroactive effect is limited. Nor do the above cases stand for the proposition that retroactivity is permitted with respect to income
taxes, but prohibited with respect to gift and estate taxes.
In Hemme and Milliken, this Court upheld retroactive features of gift and estate taxes.

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment

III
In focusing exclusively on the taxpayer's notice and reliance, the Court of Appeals held the congressional enactment
to an unduly strict standard. Because we conclude that
retroactive application of the 1987 amendment to $ 2057 is
rationally related to a legitimate legislative purpose, we
conclude that the amendment as applied to Carlton's 1986
transactions is consistent with the Due Process Clause.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor, concurring in the judgment.
The unamended 26 U. S. C. $ 2057, which allowed taxpayers to reduce the taxable estate by buying securities and
reselling them to employee stock ownership plans (ESOP's),
made it possible to avoid estate taxes by structuring transactions in a certain way. But the tax laws contain many such
provisions. See, e. g., 26 U. S. C. $ 2055 (allowing deductions
from taxable estate for transfers to the government, charities, and religious organizations). And $ 2057 was only the
latest in a series of congressional efforts to promote ESOP's
by providing tax incentives. See, e. g., 26 U. S. C. $ 133 (partial income tax exclusion for interest paid to banks on ESOP
loans); 26 U. S. C. $ 1042 (allowing certain taxpayers to defer
capital gains taxes on sale of securities to ESOP's).

Thus, although respondent Carlton may have made a
"purely tax-motivated stock transfe[r]," ante, at 32, I do not
understand the Court to express any normative disapproval
of this course of action. As executor of Willametta Day's
estate, it was entirely appropriate for Carlton to seek to reduce the estate taxes. And like all taxpayers, Carlton was
entitled to structure the estate's affairs to comply with the
tax laws while minimizing tax liability. As Learned Hand
observed with characteristic acerbity:

36 UNITED STATES v. CARLTON

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
"[A] transaction, otherwise within an exception of the
tax law, does not lose its immunity, because it is actuated
by a desire to avoid, or, if one choose, to evade, taxation.
Any one may so arrange his affairs that his taxes shall
be as low as possible; he is not bound to choose that
pattern which will best pay the Treasury; there is not
even a patriotic duty to increase one's taxes. Therefore, if what was done here, was what was intended by
[the statute], it is of no consequence that it was all an
elaborate scheme to get rid of [estate] taxes, as it certainly was." Helvering v. Gregory, 69 F. 2d 809, 810

(CA2 1934) (citations omitted), aff 'd, 293 U. S. 465 (1935).

To say that Carlton did nothing wrong in claiming the deduction does not, of course, answer the question whether Congress deprived him of due process by amending $ 2057. As
we have noted, "the retroactive aspects of economic legislation, as well as the prospective aspects, must meet the test
of due process: a legitimate legislative purpose furthered by
rational means." General Motors Corp. v. Romein, 503
U. S. 181, 191 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted).

The Court finds it relevant that, according to prominent
members of the tax-writing committees of each House, the
statute as originally enacted would have cost the Government too much money and would have allowed taxpayers to
avoid tax by engaging in sham transactions. See ante, at
31-32. Thus, the Court reasons that the amendment to

$ 2057 served the legislative purpose of "correct[ing]" a "mistake" Congress made the first time. Ante, at 32. But this
mode of analysis proves too much. Every law touching on
an area in which Congress has previously legislated can be
said to serve the legislative purpose of fixing a perceived
problem with the prior state of affairs--there is no reason to
pass a new law, after all, if the legislators are satisfied with
the old one. Moreover, the subjective motivation of Members of Congress in passing a statute--to the extent it can

even be known--is irrelevant in this context: It is sufficientfor due process analysis if there exists

some legitimate purpose underlying the retroactivity provision. Cf. FCC v.
Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U. S. 307, 313-315 (1993).

Retroactive application of revenue measures is rationally related to the legitimate governmental purpose of rais-ing revenue. In enacting revenue measures, retroactivity

allows "the legislative body, in the revision of tax laws, todistribute increased costs of government among its taxpayers in the light of present need for revenue and with knowl-edge of the sources and amounts of the various classes of
taxable income during the taxable period preceding revi-sion."

Welch v. Henry, 305 U. S. 134, 149 (1938). For this
reason,

"[i]n enacting general revenue statutes, Congress almost
without exception has given each such statute an effec-tive date prior to the date of actual enactment. . . . Usually the `retroactive' feature has application only to that
portion of the current calendar year preceding the dateof enactment, but [some statutes have been] applicable

to an entire calendar year that had expired precedingenactment. This `retroactive' application apparently
has been confined to short and limited periods requiredby the practicalities of producing national legislation.
We may safely say that it is a customary congressionalpractice."

United States v. Darusmont, 449 U. S. 292,
296-297 (1981) (per curiam).

But "the Court has never intimated that Congress possesses unlimited power to `readjust rights and burdens . . .
and upset otherwise settled expectations.' " Connolly v.
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 475 U. S. 211, 229
(1986) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (brackets omitted), quoting
Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U. S. 1, 16 (1976).
The governmental interest in revising the tax laws must at
some point give way to the taxpayer's interest in finality and

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
repose. For example, a "wholly new tax" cannot be imposed
retroactively, United States v. Hemme, 476 U. S. 558, 568
(1986), even though such a tax would surely serve to raise
money. Because the tax consequences of commercial transactions are a relevant, and sometimes dispositive, consideration in a taxpayer's decisions regarding the use of his capital, it is arbitrary to tax transactions that were not subject
to taxation at the time the taxpayer entered into them. See
Welch v. Henry, supra, at 147.

Although there is also an element of arbitrariness in retroactively changing the rate of tax to which the transaction is
subject, or the availability of a deduction for engaging in that
transaction, our cases have recognized that Congress must
be able to make such adjustments in an attempt to equalize
actual revenue and projected budgetary requirements. In
every case in which we have upheld a retroactive federal
tax statute against due process challenge, however, the law
applied retroactively for only a relatively short period prior
to enactment. See United States v. Hemme, supra, at 562
(1 month); United States v. Darusmont, supra, at 294-295
(10 months); United States v. Hudson, 299 U. S. 498, 501
(1937) (1 month). In Welch v. Henry, supra, the tax was
enacted in 1935 to reach transactions completed in 1933; but
we emphasized that the state legislature met only biannually
and it made the revision "at the first opportunity after the
tax year in which the income was received." 305 U. S., at
151. A period of retroactivity longer than the year preceding the legislative session in which the law was enacted
would raise, in my view, serious constitutional questions.
But in keeping with Congress' practice of limiting the retroactive effect of revenue measures (a practice that may reflect
Congress' sensitivity to the due process problems that would
be raised by overreaching), the December 1987 amendment
to $ 2057 was made retroactive only to October 1986. Given
our precedents and the limited period of retroactivity, I con512us1$67J 12-24-97 08:02:07 PAGES OPINPGT

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
cur in the judgment of the Court that applying the amendedstatute to respondent Carlton did not violate due process.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,concurring in the judgment.
If I thought that "substantive due process" were a constitutional right rather than an oxymoron, I would think it
violated by bait-and-switch taxation. Although there is
not much precision in the concept " `harsh and oppressive,' "
which is what the Court has adopted as its test of substantive due process unconstitutionality in the field of retroactive
tax legislation, see, e. g., United States v. Hemme, 476 U. S.
558, 568-569 (1986), quoting Welch v. Henry, 305 U. S. 134,
147 (1938), surely it would cover a retroactive amendment
that cost a taxpayer who relied on the original statute's clear
meaning over $600,000. Unlike the tax at issue in Hemme,
here the amendment "without notice, . . . gives a different
and more oppressive legal effect to conduct undertaken before enactment of the statute." 476 U. S., at 569.

The Court attempts to minimize the amendment's harshness by characterizing it as "a curative measure," quoting
some post-legislation legislative history (another oxymoron)
to show that, despite the uncontested plain meaning of the
statute, Congress never meant it to apply to stock that was
not owned by the decedent at the time of death. See ante,
at 31-32. I am not sure that whether Congress has treated
a citizen oppressively should turn upon whether the oppression was, after all, only Congress' "curing" of its own mistake. Even if it should, however, what was done to respondent here went beyond a "cure." The retroactivity not only
hit him with the tax that Congress "meant" to impose originally, but it caused his expenditures incurred in invited reliance upon the earlier law to become worthless. That could
have been avoided, of course, by providing a tax credit for
such expenditures. Retroactively disallowing the tax bene512us1$67K 12-24-97 08:02:07 PAGES OPINPGT

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
fit that the earlier law offered, without compensating thosewho incurred expenses in accepting that offer, seems to me

harsh and oppressive by any normal measure.The Court seeks to distinguish our precedents invalidating
retroactive taxes by pointing out that they involved the imposition of new taxes rather than a change in tax rates. See
ante, at 34. But eliminating the specifically promised reward for costly action after the action has been taken, andrefusing to reimburse the cost, is even more harsh and oppressive, it seems to me, than merely imposing a new tax onpast actions. The Court also attempts to soften the impact
of the amendment by noting that it involved only "a modest
period of retroactivity." Ante, at 32. But in the case of a
tax-incentive provision, as opposed to a tax on a continuous
activity (like the earning of income), the critical event is the
taxpayer's reliance on the incentive, and the key timing issue
is whether the change occurs after the reliance; that it occurs
immediately after rather than long after renders it no less
harsh.

The reasoning the Court applies to uphold the statute in
this case guarantees that all retroactive tax laws will henceforth be valid. To pass constitutional muster the retroactive aspects of the statute need only be "rationally related
to a legitimate legislative purpose." Ante, at 35. Revenue
raising is certainly a legitimate legislative purpose, see U. S.
Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 1, and any law that retroactively adds
a tax, removes a deduction, or increases a rate rationally
furthers that goal. I welcome this recognition that the Due
Process Clause does not prevent retroactive taxes, since I
believe that the Due Process Clause guarantees no substantive rights, but only (as it says) process, see TXO Production
Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U. S. 443, 470-471
(1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).

I cannot avoid observing, however, two stark discrepancies
between today's due process reasoning and the due process
reasoning the Court applies to its identification of new so512us1$67K 12-24-97 08:02:07 PAGES OPINPGT

called fundamental rights, such as the right to structure fam-ily living arrangements, see

Moore v. East Cleveland, 431
U. S. 494 (1977) (plurality opinion), and the right to an abor-tion, see

Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973). First and most
obviously, where respondent's claimed right to hold onto his
property is at issue, the Court upholds the tax amendmentbecause it rationally furthers a legitimate interest; whereas

when other claimed rights that the Court deems fundamentalare at issue, the Court strikes down laws that concededly
promote legitimate interests, id., at 150, 162. Secondly,when it is pointed out that the Court's retroactive-tax ruling
today is inconsistent with earlier decisions, see, e. g., Nichols
v. Coolidge, 274 U. S. 531 (1927); Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S.

142 (1927); Untermyer v. Anderson, 276 U. S. 440 (1928), the
Court dismisses those cases as having been "decided during
an era characterized by exacting review of economic legislation under an approach that `has long since been discarded.' "
Ante, at 34, quoting Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 730
(1963). But economic legislation was not the only legislation subjected to "exacting review" in those bad old days,
and one wonders what principled reason justifies "discarding" that bad old approach only as to that category. For
the Court continues to rely upon "exacting review" cases of
the Nichols-Blodgett-Untermyer vintage for its due process
"fundamental rights" jurisprudence. See, e. g., Roe, supra,
at 152-153, 159 (citing Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390, 399
(1923), and Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510, 535
(1925)); see also Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479, 483
(1965) ("[W]e reaffirm the principle of the Pierce and the
Meyer cases").

The picking and choosing among various rights to be accorded "substantive due process" protection is alone enough
to arouse suspicion; but the categorical and inexplicable exclusion of so-called "economic rights" (even though the Due
Process Clause explicitly applies to "property") unquestionably involves policymaking rather than neutral legal analy512us1$67K 12-24-97 08:02:07 PAGES OPINPGT

and adds, beyond that, a right to due process when life,liberty, or property is to be taken away.

CITY OF LADUE et al. v. GILLEO
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 92-1856. Argued February 23, 1994--Decided June 13, 1994
An ordinance of petitioner City of Ladue bans all residential signs but

those falling within 1 of 10 exemptions, for the principal purpose of
minimizing the visual clutter associated with such signs. Respondent
Gilleo filed this action, alleging that the ordinance violated her right to
free speech by prohibiting her from displaying a sign stating, "For Peace
in the Gulf," from her home. The District Court found the ordinance
unconstitutional, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the
ordinance was a "content based" regulation, and that Ladue's substantial interests in enacting it were not sufficiently compelling to support
such a restriction.

Held: The ordinance violates a Ladue resident's right to free speech.

Pp. 48-59.

(a) While signs pose distinctive problems and thus are subject to municipalities' police powers, measures regulating them inevitably affect
communication itself. Such a regulation may be challenged on the
ground that it restricts too little speech because its exemptions discriminate on the basis of signs' messages, or on the ground that it prohibits too much protected speech. For purposes of this case, the validity of Ladue's submission that its ordinance's various exemptions are
free of impermissible content or viewpoint discrimination is assumed.
Pp. 48-53.

(b) Although Ladue has a concededly valid interest in minimizing
visual clutter, it has almost completely foreclosed an important and distinct medium of expression to political, religious, or personal messages.
Prohibitions foreclosing entire media may be completely free of content
or viewpoint discrimination, but such measures can suppress too much
speech by eliminating a common means of speaking. Pp. 54-55.

(c) Ladue's attempt to justify the ordinance as a "time, place, or manner" restriction fails because alternatives such as handbills and newspaper advertisements are inadequate substitutes for the important
medium that Ladue has closed off. Displaying a sign from one's own
residence carries a message quite distinct from placing the same sign
someplace else, or conveying the same text or picture by other means,
for it provides information about the speaker's identity, an important
component of many attempts to persuade. Residential signs are also

Syllabus
an unusually cheap and convenient form of communication. Furthermore, the audience intended to be reached by a residential sign--neighbors--could not be reached nearly as well by other means. Pp. 56-57.

(d) A special respect for individual liberty in the home has long been
part of this Nation's culture and law and has a special resonance when
the government seeks to constrain a person's ability to speak there.
The decision reached here does not leave Ladue powerless to address
the ills that may be associated with residential signs. In addition, residents' self-interest in maintaining their own property values and preventing "visual clutter" in their yards and neighborhoods diminishes the
danger of an "unlimited" proliferation of signs. Pp. 58-59.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
An ordinance of the City of Ladue prohibits homeownersfrom displaying any signs on their property except "residence identification" signs, "for sale" signs, and signs warn-ing of safety hazards. The ordinance permits commercial
establishments, churches, and nonprofit organizations toerect certain signs that are not allowed at residences. The
question presented is whether the ordinance violates aLadue resident's right to free speech.

Respondent Margaret P. Gilleo owns one of the 57 single-family homes in the Willow Hill subdivision of Ladue.

December 8, 1990, she placed on her front lawn a 24- by 36-inch sign printed with the words, "Say No to War in the

Persian Gulf, Call Congress Now." After that sign disap-peared, Gilleo put up another but it was knocked to the
ground. When Gilleo reported these incidents to the police,they advised her that such signs were prohibited in Ladue.

2 Ladue is a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri. It has a population of almost

9,000, and an area of about 8.5 square miles, of which only 3% is zoned for
commercial or industrial use.

46 CITY OF LADUE v. GILLEO

Opinion of the Court
Ladue's sign ordinance violated her First Amendment right
of free speech.

The District Court issued a preliminary injunction against
enforcement of the ordinance. 774 F. Supp. 1559 (ED Mo.
1991). Gilleo then placed an 8.5- by 11-inch sign in the second story window of her home stating, "For Peace in the
Gulf." The Ladue City Council responded to the injunction
by repealing its ordinance and enacting a replacement.4
Like its predecessor, the new ordinance contains a general
prohibition of "signs" and defines that term broadly.5 The
ordinance prohibits all signs except those that fall within 1
of 10 exemptions. Thus, "residential identification signs" no
larger than one square foot are allowed, as are signs advertising "that the property is for sale, lease or exchange" and
identifying the owner or agent. $ 35-10, App. to Pet. for
Cert. 45a. Also exempted are signs "for churches, religious
institutions, and schools," $ 35-5, id., at 41a, "[c]ommercial
signs in commercially zoned or industrial zoned districts,"

$ 35-4, ibid., and on-site signs advertising "gasoline filling

4 The new ordinance eliminates the provision allowing for variances and
contains a grandfather clause exempting signs already lawfully in place.

5 Section 35-2 of the ordinance declares that "No sign shall be erected

[or] maintained" in the City except in conformity with the ordinance;

$ 35-3 authorizes the City to remove nonconforming signs. App. to Pet.
for Cert. 40a. Section 35-1 defines "sign" as:

"A name, word, letter, writing, identification, description, or illustration
which is erected, placed upon, affixed to, painted or represented upon a
building or structure, or any part thereof, or in any manner upon a parcel
of land or lot, and which publicizes an object, product, place, activity, opinion, person, institution, organization or place of business, or which is used
to advertise or promote the interests of any person. The word `sign' shall
also include `banners', `pennants', `insignia', `bulletin boards', `ground
signs', `billboard', `poster billboards', `illuminated signs', `projecting signs',
`temporary signs', `marquees', `roof signs', `yard signs', `electric signs',
`wall signs', and `window signs', wherever placed out of doors in view of
the general public or wherever placed indoors as a window sign." Id.,
at 39a.

stations," 6 $ 35-6, id., at 42a. Unlike its predecessor, thenew ordinance contains a lengthy "Declaration of Findings,

Policies, Interests, and Purposes," part of which recitesthat the

"proliferation of an unlimited number of signs in private,residential, commercial, industrial, and public areas of
the City of Ladue would create ugliness, visual blightand clutter, tarnish the natural beauty of the landscape
as well as the residential and commercial architecture,impair property values, substantially impinge upon the
privacy and special ambience of the community, and maycause safety and traffic hazards to motorists, pedestrians, and children." Id., at 36a.
Gilleo amended her complaint to challenge the new ordi-nance, which explicitly prohibits window signs like hers.

The District Court held the ordinance unconstitutional, 774F. Supp. 1559 (ED Mo. 1991), and the Court of Appeals affirmed, 986 F. 2d 1180 (CA8 1993). Relying on the pluralityopinion in

Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U. S. 490(1981), the Court of Appeals held the ordinance invalid as a

"content based" regulation because the City treated commer-cial speech more favorably than noncommercial speech and
favored some kinds of noncommercial speech over others.

6 The full catalog of exceptions, each subject to special size limitations, is
as follows: "[M]unicipal signs"; "[s]ubdivision and residence identification"
signs; "[r]oad signs and driveway signs for danger, direction, or identification"; "[h]ealth inspection signs"; "[s]igns for churches, religious institutions, and schools" (subject to regulations set forth in $ 35-5); "identification signs" for other not-for-profit organizations; signs "identifying the
location of public transportation stops"; "[g]round signs advertising the
sale or rental of real property," subject to the conditions, set forth in

$ 35-10, that such signs may "not be attached to any tree, fence or utility
pole" and may contain only the fact of proposed sale or rental and the
seller or agent's name and address or telephone number; "[c]ommercial
signs in commercially zoned or industrial zoned districts," subject to restrictions set out elsewhere in the ordinance; and signs that "identif[y]
safety hazards." $ 35-4, id., at 41a, 45a.

48 CITY OF LADUE v. GILLEO

Opinion of the Court
986 F. 2d, at 1182. Acknowledging that "Ladue's interestsin enacting its ordinance are substantial," the Court of Appeals nevertheless concluded that those interests were "notsufficiently `compelling' to support a content-based restriction." Id., at 1183-1184 (citing Simon & Schuster, Inc. v.
Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105,118 (1991)).

We granted the City of Ladue's petition for certiorari, 510U. S. 809 (1993), and now affirm.

II
While signs are a form of expression protected by the FreeSpeech Clause, they pose distinctive problems that are subject to municipalities' police powers. Unlike oral speech,signs take up space and may obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses for land, and pose other prob-lems that legitimately call for regulation. It is common
ground that governments may regulate the physical charac-teristics of signs--just as they can, within reasonable bounds
and absent censorial purpose, regulate audible expression inits capacity as noise. See,

e. g., Ward v. Rock Against Rac-ism, 491 U. S. 781 (1989); Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U. S. 77

(1949). However, because regulation of a medium inevitablyaffects communication itself, it is not surprising that we have
had occasion to review the constitutionality of municipal or-dinances prohibiting the display of certain outdoor signs.

In Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Willingboro, 431 U. S. 85(1977), we addressed an ordinance that sought to maintain
stable, integrated neighborhoods by prohibiting homeownersfrom placing "For Sale" or "Sold" signs on their property.
Although we recognized the importance of Willingboro'sobjective, we held that the First Amendment prevented
the township from "achieving its goal by restricting the freeflow of truthful information." Id., at 95. In some respects
Linmark is the mirror image of this case. For instead ofprohibiting "For Sale" signs without banning any other

49Cite as: 512 U. S. 43 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
signs, Ladue has exempted such signs from an otherwise vir-tually complete ban. Moreover, whereas in Linmark we

noted that the ordinance was not concerned with the promo-tion of esthetic values unrelated to the content of the prohibited speech, id., at 93-94, here Ladue relies squarely on thatcontent-neutral justification for its ordinance.

In Metromedia, we reviewed an ordinance imposing sub-stantial prohibitions on outdoor advertising displays within
the city of San Diego in the interest of traffic safety andesthetics. The ordinance generally banned all except those
advertising "on-site" activities.7 The Court concluded thatthe city's interest in traffic safety and its esthetic interest in
preventing "visual clutter" could justify a prohibition of off-site commercial billboards even though similar on-site signs
were allowed. 453 U. S., at 511-512.8 Nevertheless, theCourt's judgment in

Metromedia, supported by two differentlines of reasoning, invalidated the San Diego ordinance in its

entirety. According to Justice White's plurality opinion, theordinance impermissibly discriminated on the basis of content by permitting on-site commercial speech while broadlyprohibiting noncommercial messages.

Id., at 514-515. On

7 The San Diego ordinance defined "on-site signs" as "those `designating
the name of the owner or occupant of the premises upon which such signs
are placed, or identifying such premises; or signs advertising goods manufactured or produced or services rendered on the premises upon which
such signs are placed.' " Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U. S., at 494.
The plurality read the "on-site" exemption of the San Diego ordinance as
inapplicable to noncommercial messages. See id., at 513. Cf. id., at 535-
536 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment). The ordinance also exempted
12 categories of displays, including religious signs; for sale signs; signs
on public and commercial vehicles; and " `[t]emporary political campaign

the other hand, Justice Brennan, joined by Justice Blackmun, concluded that "the practical effect of the San Diego
ordinance [was] to eliminate the billboard as an effective me-dium of communication" for noncommercial messages, and

that the city had failed to make the strong showing needed
to justify such "content-neutral prohibitions of particularmedia of communication."

Id., at 525-527. The three dissenters also viewed San Diego's ordinance as tantamount toa blanket prohibition of billboards, but would have upheld it

because they did not perceive "even a hint of bias or censor-ship in the city's actions" nor "any reason to believe that the
overall communications market in San Diego is inadequate."
Id., at 552-553 (Stevens, J., dissenting in part). See also
id., at 563, 566 (Burger, C. J., dissenting); id., at 569-570
(Rehnquist, J., dissenting).

In Members of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers
for Vincent, 466 U. S. 789 (1984), we upheld a Los Angeles
ordinance that prohibited the posting of signs on public property. Noting the conclusion shared by seven Justices in
Metromedia that San Diego's "interest in avoiding visual
clutter" was sufficient to justify a prohibition of commercial
billboards, 466 U. S., at 806-807, in Vincent we upheld the
Los Angeles ordinance, which was justified on the same
grounds. We rejected the argument that the validity of the
city's esthetic interest had been compromised by failing

to extend the ban to private property, reasoning that the
"private citizen's interest in controlling the use of his own
property justifies the disparate treatment." Id., at 811.
We also rejected as "misplaced" respondents' reliance on
public forum principles, for they had "fail[ed] to demonstrate
the existence of a traditional right of access respecting such
items as utility poles . . . comparable to that recognized for
public streets and parks." Id., at 814.

These decisions identify two analytically distinct grounds
for challenging the constitutionality of a municipal ordinance
regulating the display of signs. One is that the measure in

Opinion of the Court
effect restricts too little speech because its exemptions dis-criminate on the basis of the signs' messages. See Metromedia, 453 U. S., at 512-517 (opinion of White, J.). Alterna-tively, such provisions are subject to attack on the ground
that they simply prohibit too much protected speech. See
id., at 525-534 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment). TheCity of Ladue contends, first, that the Court of Appeals' reliance on the former rationale was misplaced because theCity's regulatory purposes are content neutral, and, second,
that those purposes justify the comprehensiveness of thesign prohibition. A comment on the former contention will
help explain why we ultimately base our decision on a rejec-tion of the latter.

III
While surprising at first glance, the notion that a regula-tion of speech may be impermissibly

underinclusive is firmlygrounded in basic First Amendment principles.

9 Thus, an

exemption from an otherwise permissible regulation ofspeech may represent a governmental "attempt to give one

side of a debatable public question an advantage in express-ing its views to the people."

First Nat. Bank of Bostonv. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 785-786 (1978). Alternatively,

through the combined operation of a general speech restric-tion and its exemptions, the government might seek to select
the "permissible subjects for public debate" and thereby to"control . . . the search for political truth." Consolidated
Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S.530, 538 (1980).

9 Like other classifications, regulatory distinctions among different kinds
of speech may fall afoul of the Equal Protection Clause. See, e. g., Carey
v. Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 459-471 (1980) (ordinance that forbade certain
kinds of picketing but exempted labor picketing violated Clause); Police
Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 98-102 (1972) (same).

10 Of course, not every law that turns on the content of speech is invalid. See generally Stone, Restrictions of Speech Because of its Content: The Peculiar Case of Subject-Matter Restrictions, 46 U. Chi. L. Rev.

52 CITY OF LADUE v. GILLEO

Opinion of the Court
The City argues that its sign ordinance implicates neitherof these concerns, and that the Court of Appeals therefore

erred in demanding a "compelling" justification for the ex-emptions. The mix of prohibitions and exemptions in the
ordinance, Ladue maintains, reflects legitimate differencesamong the side effects of various kinds of signs. These differences are only adventitiously connected with content, andsupply a sufficient justification, unrelated to the City's approval or disapproval of specific messages, for carving outthe specified categories from the general ban. See Brief for
Petitioners 18-23. Thus, according to the Declaration ofFindings, Policies, Interests, and Purposes supporting the
ordinance, the permitted signs, unlike the prohibited signs,are unlikely to contribute to the dangers of "unlimited proliferation" associated with categories of signs that are notinherently limited in number. App. to Pet. for Cert. 37a.
Because only a few residents will need to display "for sale"or "for rent" signs at any given time, permitting one such
sign per marketed house does not threaten visual clutter.
Ibid. Because the City has only a few businesses, churches,and schools, the same rationale explains the exemption for

on-site commercial and organizational signs. Ibid. More-over, some of the exempted categories (e. g., danger signs)
respond to unique public needs to permit certain kinds ofspeech. Ibid. Even if we assume the validity of these arguments, the exemptions in Ladue's ordinance neverthelessshed light on the separate question whether the ordinance
prohibits too much speech.Exemptions from an otherwise legitimate regulation of a
medium of speech may be noteworthy for a reason quiteapart from the risks of viewpoint and content discrimination:
They may diminish the credibility of the government's ra-tionale for restricting speech in the first place. See,

e. g.,

79 (1978). See also Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv.
Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S., at 545, and n. 2 (Stevens, J., concurring in
judgment).

Opinion of the Court
Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 424-
426 (1993). In this case, at the very least, the exemptions
from Ladue's ordinance demonstrate that Ladue has concluded that the interest in allowing certain messages to be
conveyed by means of residential signs outweighs the City's
esthetic interest in eliminating outdoor signs. Ladue has
not imposed a flat ban on signs because it has determined
that at least some of them are too vital to be banned.

Under the Court of Appeals' content discrimination rationale, the City might theoretically remove the defects in its
ordinance by simply repealing all of the exemptions. If,
however, the ordinance is also vulnerable because it prohibits too much speech, that solution would not save it. Moreover, if the prohibitions in Ladue's ordinance are impermissible, resting our decision on its exemptions would afford scant
relief for respondent Gilleo. She is primarily concerned not
with the scope of the exemptions available in other locations,
such as commercial areas and on church property; she asserts a constitutional right to display an antiwar sign at her
own home. Therefore, we first ask whether Ladue may
properly prohibit Gilleo from displaying her sign, and then,
only if necessary, consider the separate question whether it
was improper for the City simultaneously to permit certain
other signs. In examining the propriety of Ladue's neartotal prohibition of residential signs, we will assume, arguendo, the validity of the City's submission that the various
exemptions are free of impermissible content or viewpoint
discrimination.11

11 Because we set to one side the content discrimination question, we
need not address the City's argument that the ordinance, although speaking in subject-matter terms, merely targets the "undesirable secondary
effects" associated with certain kinds of signs. See Renton v. Playtime
Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, 49 (1986). The inquiry we undertake below
into the adequacy of alternative channels of communication would also
apply to a provision justified on those grounds. See id., at 50.

54 CITY OF LADUE v. GILLEO

Opinion of the Court

IV
In Linmark we held that the city's interest in maintaininga stable, racially integrated neighborhood was not sufficient

to support a prohibition of residential "For Sale" signs. Werecognized that even such a narrow sign prohibition would
have a deleterious effect on residents' ability to convey im-portant information because alternatives were "far from
satisfactory." 431 U. S., at 93. Ladue's sign ordinance issupported principally by the City's interest in minimizing
the visual clutter associated with signs, an interest that isconcededly valid but certainly no more compelling than the
interests at stake in Linmark. Moreover, whereas the ordi-nance in Linmark applied only to a form of commercial
speech, Ladue's ordinance covers even such absolutely piv-otal speech as a sign protesting an imminent governmental
decision to go to war.The impact on free communication of Ladue's broad sign
prohibition, moreover, is manifestly greater than in Linmark. Gilleo and other residents of Ladue are forbidden todisplay virtually any "sign" on their property. The ordinance defines that term sweepingly. A prohibition is notalways invalid merely because it applies to a sizeable category of speech; the sign ban we upheld in Vincent, for exam-ple, was quite broad. But in

Vincent we specifically notedthat the category of speech in question--signs placed on public property--was not a "uniquely valuable or importantmode of communication," and that there was no evidence
that "appellees' ability to communicate effectively is threat-ened by ever-increasing restrictions on expression." 466
U. S., at 812.Here, in contrast, Ladue has almost completely foreclosed
a venerable means of communication that is both unique andimportant. It has totally foreclosed that medium to political, religious, or personal messages. Signs that react to alocal happening or express a view on a controversial issue
both reflect and animate change in the life of a community.

Opinion of the Court
Often placed on lawns or in windows, residential signs playan important part in political campaigns, during which they

are displayed to signal the resident's support for particularcandidates, parties, or causes.

12 They may not afford the

same opportunities for conveying complex ideas as do othermedia, but residential signs have long been an important and

distinct medium of expression.Our prior decisions have voiced particular concern with
laws that foreclose an entire medium of expression. Thus,we have held invalid ordinances that completely banned the
distribution of pamphlets within the municipality, Lovell v.
City of Griffin, 303 U. S. 444, 451-452 (1938); handbills onthe public streets,

Jamison v. Texas, 318 U. S. 413, 416 (1943);the door-to-door distribution of literature, Martin v. City of

Struthers, 319 U. S. 141, 145-149 (1943); Schneider v. State(Town of Irvington), 308 U. S. 147, 164-165 (1939), and live
entertainment, Schad v. Mount Ephraim, 452 U. S. 61, 75-76(1981). See also Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 486 (1988)
(picketing focused upon individual residence is "fundamen-tally different from more generally directed means of communication that may not be completely banned in residentialareas"). Although prohibitions foreclosing entire media
may be completely free of content or viewpoint discrimina-tion, the danger they pose to the freedom of speech is readily
apparent--by eliminating a common means of speaking, suchmeasures can suppress too much speech.

56 CITY OF LADUE v. GILLEO

Opinion of the Court
Ladue contends, however, that its ordinance is a mere reg-ulation of the "time, place, or manner" of speech because

residents remain free to convey their desired messages byother means, such as hand-held signs, "letters, handbills,
flyers, telephone calls, newspaper advertisements, bumperstickers, speeches, and neighborhood or community meetings." Brief for Petitioners 41. However, even regulationsthat do not foreclose an entire medium of expression, but
merely shift the time, place, or manner of its use, must"leave open ample alternative channels for communication."
Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S.288, 293 (1984). In this case, we are not persuaded that adequate substitutes exist for the important medium of speechthat Ladue has closed off.

Displaying a sign from one's own residence often carries amessage quite distinct from placing the same sign someplace
else, or conveying the same text or picture by other means.Precisely because of their location, such signs provide information about the identity of the "speaker." As an early andeminent student of rhetoric observed, the identity of the
speaker is an important component of many attempts to per-suade.

14 A sign advocating "Peace in the Gulf " in the front

lawn of a retired general or decorated war veteran may pro-voke a different reaction than the same sign in a 10-yearold child's bedroom window or the same message on abumper sticker of a passing automobile. An espousal of
socialism may carry different implications when displayed
Press v. United States, 326 U. S. 1, 20 (1945),] and the `unfettered interchange of ideas,' [Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476, 484 (1957),] the
first amendment prohibits not only content-based restrictions that censor
particular points of view, but also content-neutral restrictions that unduly
constrict the opportunities for free expression."

on the grounds of a stately mansion than when pasted on afactory wall or an ambulatory sandwich board.

Residential signs are an unusually cheap and convenientform of communication. Especially for persons of modest
means or limited mobility, a yard or window sign may haveno practical substitute. Cf.

Vincent, 466 U. S., at 812-813,n. 30; Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 793-794 (1983);

Martin v. City of Struthers, 319 U. S., at 146; Milk WagonDrivers v. Meadowmoor Dairies, Inc., 312 U. S. 287, 293
(1941). Even for the affluent, the added costs in money ortime of taking out a newspaper advertisement, handing out
leaflets on the street, or standing in front of one's house witha hand-held sign may make the difference between participating and not participating in some public debate.15 Fur-thermore, a person who puts up a sign at her residence

often intends to reach neighbors, an audience that could notbe reached nearly as well by other means.

16

15 The precise location of many other kinds of signs (aside from "on-site"
signs) is of lesser communicative importance. For example, assuming the
audience is similar, a commercial advertiser or campaign publicist is likely
to be relatively indifferent between one sign site and another. The elimination of a cheap and handy medium of expression is especially apt to
deter individuals from communicating their views to the public, for unlike
businesses (and even political organizations) individuals generally realize
few tangible benefits from such communication. Cf. Virginia Bd. of
Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748,
772, n. 24 (1976) ("Since advertising is the sine qua non of commercial
profits, there is little likelihood of its being chilled by proper regulation
and forgone entirely").

16 Counsel for Ladue has also cited flags as a viable alternative to signs.

Counsel observed that the ordinance does not restrict flags of any stripe,
including flags bearing written messages. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 16, 21
(noting that rectangular flags, unlike "pennants" and "banners," are not
prohibited by the ordinance). Even assuming that flags are nearly as affordable and legible as signs, we do not think the mere possibility that
another medium could be used in an unconventional manner to carry the
same messages alters the fact that Ladue has banned a distinct and traditionally important medium of expression. See, e. g., Schneider v. State
(Town of Irvington), 308 U. S. 147, 163 (1939).

58 CITY OF LADUE v. GILLEO

Opinion of the Court
A special respect for individual liberty in the home haslong been part of our culture and our law, see, e. g., Payton

v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 596-597, and nn. 44-45 (1980);that principle has special resonance when the government
seeks to constrain a person's ability to speak there. See
Spence v. Washington, 418 U. S. 405, 406, 409, 411 (1974) (percuriam). Most Americans would be understandably dismayed, given that tradition, to learn that it was illegal todisplay from their window an 8- by 11-inch sign expressing
their political views. Whereas the government's need tomediate among various competing uses, including expressive
ones, for public streets and facilities is constant and unavoidable, see Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569, 574, 576(1941); see also

Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 278 (1981)
(Stevens, J., concurring in judgment), its need to regulatetemperate speech from the home is surely much less pressing, see Spence, 418 U. S., at 409.Our decision that Ladue's ban on almost all residential
signs violates the First Amendment by no means leaves theCity powerless to address the ills that may be associated
with residential signs.17 It bears mentioning that individualresidents themselves have strong incentives to keep their
own property values up and to prevent "visual clutter" intheir own yards and neighborhoods--incentives markedly
different from those of persons who erect signs on others'land, in others' neighborhoods, or on public property. Residents' self-interest diminishes the danger of the "unlimited"
proliferation of residential signs that concerns the City ofLadue. We are confident that more temperate measures

could in large part satisfy Ladue's stated regulatory needs

17 Nor do we hold that every kind of sign must be permitted in residential areas. Different considerations might well apply, for example, in the
case of signs (whether political or otherwise) displayed by residents for a
fee, or in the case of off-site commercial advertisements on residential
property. We also are not confronted here with mere regulations short
of a ban.

As currently framed, however, the ordinance abridges those

Justice O'Connor, concurring.
It is unusual for us, when faced with a regulation that on
its face draws content distinctions, to "assume, arguendo, the
validity of the City's submission that the various exemptions
are free of impermissible content or viewpoint discrimination." Ante, at 53. With rare exceptions, content discrimination in regulations of the speech of private citizens
on private property or in a traditional public forum is presumptively impermissible, and this presumption is a very
strong one. Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y.
State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 115-116 (1991). The
normal inquiry that our doctrine dictates is, first, to determine whether a regulation is content based or content neutral, and then, based on the answer to that question, to apply
the proper level of scrutiny. See, e. g., Burson v. Freeman,
504 U. S. 191, 197-198 (1992) (plurality opinion); Forsyth
County v. Nationalist Movement, 505 U. S. 123, 133-135

Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95, 98-99 (1972).

Over the years, some cogent criticisms have been leveled
at our approach. See, e. g., R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S.

O'Connor, J., concurring
Stephan, The First Amendment and Content Discrimination,68 Va. L. Rev. 203 (1982). And it is quite true that regulations are occasionally struck down because of their content-based nature, even though common sense may suggest that
they are entirely reasonable. The content distinctions pres-ent in this ordinance may, to some, be a good example of this.

But though our rule has flaws, it has substantial merit aswell. It is a rule, in an area where fairly precise rules are
better than more discretionary and more subjective balanc-ing tests. See

Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U. S.46, 52-53 (1988). On a theoretical level, it reflects important

insights into the meaning of the free speech principle--forinstance, that content-based speech restrictions are especially likely to be improper attempts to value some forms ofspeech over others, or are particularly susceptible to being
used by the government to distort public debate. See, e. g.,
ante, at 51-53; Mosley, supra, at 95; Stone, Content Regula-tion and the First Amendment, 25 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 189

(1983). On a practical level, it has in application generallyled to seemingly sensible results. And, perhaps most importantly, no better alternative has yet come to light.I would have preferred to apply our normal analytical
structure in this case, which may well have required us toexamine this law with the scrutiny appropriate to contentbased regulations. Perhaps this would have forced us toconfront some of the difficulties with the existing doctrine;
perhaps it would have shown weaknesses in the rule, and ledus to modify it to take into account the special factors this
case presents. But such reexamination is part of the proc-ess by which our rules evolve and improve.

Nonetheless, I join the Court's opinion, because I agreewith its conclusion in Part IV that even if the restriction
were content neutral, it would still be invalid, and because Ido not think Part III casts any doubt on the propriety of our
normal content discrimination inquiry.

DEPARTMENT OF TAXATION AND FINANCE OFNEW YORK

et al.

certiorari to the court of appeals of new york

No. 93-377. Argued March 23, 1994--Decided June 13, 1994
Enrolled tribal members purchasing cigarettes on Indian reservations are

exempt from a New York cigarette tax, but non-Indians making such
purchases are not. Licensed agents precollect the tax by purchasing
stamps and affixing them to cigarette packs in advance of their first sale.
Determining that a large volume of unstamped cigarettes was being
purchased by non-Indians on reservations, petitioner tax department
enacted regulations imposing recordkeeping requirements and quantity
limitations on cigarette wholesalers selling untaxed cigarettes to reservation Indians. As relevant here, the regulations set quotas on the
quantity of untaxed cigarettes that wholesalers may sell to tribes and
tribal retailers, and petitioner tax department must approve each such
sale. Wholesalers must also ensure that a buyer holds a valid state tax
exemption certificate, and must keep records of their tax-exempt sales,
make monthly reports to petitioners, and, as licensed agents, precollect
taxes on nonexempt sales. Respondent wholesalers are licensed by the
Bureau of Indian Affairs to sell cigarettes to reservation Indians. They
filed separate suits in state court alleging that the regulations were
pre-empted by the federal Indian Trader Statutes. The trial court issued an injunction. Ultimately, the Appellate Division upheld the regulations, but the Court of Appeals reversed, distinguishing this Court's
decisions upholding taxes imposed on non-Indian purchasers of cigarettes, see Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Flathead
Reservation, 425 U. S. 463; Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation, 447 U. S. 134, on the ground that they involved regulating sales to non-Indian consumers whereas New York's regulations
applied to sales by non-Indian wholesalers to reservation Indians. The
court concluded that the Indian Trader Statutes, as construed in Warren
Trading Post Co. v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, 380 U. S. 685, deprived the
States of all power to impose regulatory burdens on licensed Indian
traders, and, alternatively, that if States could impose minimal burdens
on the traders, New York's regulations were invalid because the burdens were significant.

Held: New York's regulations do not, on their face, violate the Indian

Trader Statutes. Pp. 69-78.

MILHELM ATTEA & BROS.

Syllabus

(a) Because respondents have made essentially a facial challenge, this
case is confined to those alleged defects that inhere in the regulations
as written, and the Court need not assess for all purposes each feature
of the tax scheme that might affect tribal self-government or federal
authority over Indian affairs. Pp. 69-70.

(b) Indian traders are not wholly immune from state regulation that
is reasonably necessary to the assessment or collection of lawful state
taxes. Although broad language in Warren Trading Post suggests such
immunity, that proposition has been undermined by subsequent decisions in Moe (upholding a state law requiring Indian retailers on tribal
land to collect a state cigarette tax imposed on sales to non-Indians),
Colville (upholding in relevant part a state law requiring tribal retailers
on reservations to collect cigarette taxes on sales to nonmembers and
to keep extensive records), and Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Citizen Band
of Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., 498 U. S. 505. These cases have made
clear that the States have a valid interest in ensuring compliance with
lawful taxes that might easily be evaded through purchases of taxexempt cigarettes on reservations; that interest outweighs tribes' modest interest in offering a tax exemption to customers who would ordinarily shop elsewhere. Thus, there is more room for state regulation
in this area. In particular, these cases have decided that States may
impose on reservation retailers minimal burdens reasonably tailored to
the collection of valid taxes from non-Indians. It would be anomalous
to hold that a State could impose tax collection and bookkeeping burdens on reservation retailers who are enrolled tribal members but not
on wholesalers, who often are not. Pp. 70-75.

(c) New York's scheme does not impose excessive burdens on Indian
traders. Respondents' objections to the regulations setting quotas and
requiring that petitioners preapprove deliveries provide no basis for a
facial challenge, although the possibility of inadequate quotas may provide a basis for a future challenge to the regulations' application. The
requirements that wholesalers sell untaxed cigarettes only to persons
with valid exemption certificates and keep detailed records are no more
demanding than comparable measures approved in Colville. Moreover, the precollection obligation placed on wholesalers is the same as
the obligation that, under Moe and Colville, may be imposed on reservation retailers. The United States' arguments supporting its position

64 DEPARTMENT OF TAXATION AND FINANCE OF N. Y. v.

MILHELM ATTEA & BROS.

Opinion of the Court

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
Cigarette consumers in New York are subject to a statetax of 56 cents per pack. Enrolled tribal members who purchase cigarettes on Indian reservations are exempt from thistax, but non-Indians making purchases on reservations must
pay it. To prevent non-Indians from escaping the tax, NewYork has enacted a regulatory scheme that imposes recordkeeping requirements and quantity limitations on cigarettewholesalers who sell untaxed cigarettes to reservation Indians. The question presented is whether New York's pro-gram is pre-empted by federal statutes governing trade
with Indians. I

Article 20 of the New York Tax Law imposes a tax on allcigarettes possessed in the State except those that New York
is "without power" to tax. N. Y. Tax Law $ 471(1) (McKin-ney 1987 and Supp. 1994). The State collects the cigarette
tax through licensed agents who purchase tax stamps andaffix them to cigarette packs in advance of the first sale
within the State. The full amount of the tax is part of theprice of stamped cigarettes at all subsequent steps in the
distribution stream. Accordingly, the "ultimate incidence ofand liability for the tax [is] upon the consumer." $ 471(2).
Any person who "willfully attempts in any manner to evadeor defeat" the cigarette tax commits a misdemeanor. N. Y.
Tax Law $ 1814(a) (McKinney 1987).Because New York lacks authority to tax cigarettes sold
to tribal members for their own consumption, see Moe v.Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Flathead Reservation, 425 U. S. 463, 475-481 (1976), cigarettes to be con-sumed on the reservation by enrolled tribal members are tax
exempt and need not be stamped. On-reservation cigarettesales to persons other than reservation Indians, however, are
legitimately subject to state taxation. See Washington v.
Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation, 447 U. S. 134,160-161 (1980). In 1988, New York's Department of Taxa512us1$69I 12-24-97 08:18:18 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tion and Finance 1 determined that a large volume of un-stamped cigarettes was being purchased by non-Indians from

reservation retailers. According to an affidavit submittedby an official in the Department's Audit Division, the volume
of tax-exempt cigarettes sold on New York reservations in1987-1988 would, if consumed exclusively by tax-immune Indians, correspond to a consumption rate 20 times higher thanthat of the average New York resident; in 1988-1989, putative reservation consumption was 32 times the statewide av-erage. See Record 244-246 (Affidavit of Jamie Woodward).
Because unlawful purchases of unstamped cigarettes de-prived New York of substantial tax revenues--now estimated at more than $65 million per year--the Departmentadopted the regulations at issue in this case.

The regulations recognize the right of "exempt Indiannations or tribes, qualified Indian consumers and registered

dealers" to "purchase, on qualified reservations, cigarettesupon which the seller has not prepaid and precollected the
cigarette tax imposed pursuant to article 20 of the Tax Law."20 N. Y. C. R. R. $ 336.6(a) (1992). To ensure that nonexempt purchasers do not likewise escape taxation, the regula-tions limit the quantity of untaxed cigarettes that wholesalers may sell to tribes and tribal retailers. The limitationsmay be established and enforced in alternative ways. A
tribe may enter into an agreement with the Department "toregulate, license, or control the sale and distribution within
its qualified reservation of an agreed upon amount of [un1 The petitioners in this case are the Department of Taxation and Finance of the State of New York, its Commissioner James W. Wetzler, and

in an effort to prevent sales of untaxed gasoline to non-Indians on reservations. See Herzog Bros. Trucking, Inc. v. State Tax Comm'n, 69 N. Y. 2d

taxed] cigarettes," in which case wholesalers must obtain thetribe's approval for each delivery of untaxed cigarettes to a

reservation retailer. $ 336.7(c)(1). In the absence of suchan agreement--and apparently there have been none to
date--the Department itself limits the permitted quantity ofuntaxed cigarettes based on the "probable demand" of
tax-exempt Indian consumers. $ 336.7(d)(1).The Department calculates "probable demand" in either of
two ways. If a tribe "regulates, licenses or controls the saleand distribution of cigarettes within its reservation," the Department will rely upon evidence submitted by that tribeconcerning local demand for cigarettes. $ 336.7(d)(2)(i).

3

Otherwise, the Department fixes the untaxed cigarette limitfor a tribe by multiplying the "New York average [cigarette]

consumption per capita" by the number of enrolled membersof the affected tribe. $$ 336.7(d)(1), (d)(2)(ii). Each sale of
untaxed cigarettes by a wholesaler to a tribe or reservationretailer must be approved by the Department; approval is
"based upon evidence of valid purchase orders received bythe agent [i. e., wholesaler] of quantities of cigarettes reasonably related to the probable demand of qualified Indian con-sumers in the trade territory" of the tribe. Ibid.

4 Retailers are sent "Tax Exemption Coupons" entitling them totheir monthly allotment of tax-exempt cigarettes. The retailer gives copies of its coupons to the wholesaler upon de-livery, and the wholesaler forwards one to the Department.
See Brief for Petitioners 12-13; App. 44-45. The Depart-ment may withhold approval of deliveries to tribes or re3 The regulation cites as examples of such evidence "records of previous sales to qualified Indian consumers, records relating to the average

of cigarettes; otherwise, the Department determines the trade territory

tailers who "are or have been" violating the regulations,$ 336.7(d)(6), and may cancel the exemption certificates of

noncomplying tribes or retailers. See $$ 336.6(d)(3), (e)(5).Wholesalers who wish to sell tax-free cigarettes to Indian
tribes or reservation retailers must ensure that the buyerintends to distribute the cigarettes to tax-exempt consumers,
takes delivery on the reservation, and holds a valid statetax exemption certificate.

5 Reservation retailers may sell

unstamped cigarettes only to "qualified Indian consumers,"who at the time of first purchase must provide the retailer

with a "certificate of individual Indian exemption" and pro-vide written evidence of their identity for subsequent purchases. $$ 336.6(e)(2), (g)(1).6Wholesale distributors of tax-exempt cigarettes must hold
state licenses authorizing them to purchase and affix NewYork cigarette tax stamps, and must collect taxes on nonexempt sales. $$ 336.7(b)(2), (e). They must also keep rec-ords reflecting the identity of the buyer in each tax-exempt
sale and make monthly reports to the Department on all suchsales. $$ 336.6(g)(3)-(4). New York's regulatory scheme,
unsurprisingly, imposes no restrictions on the sale ofstamped cigarettes--i. e., those on which taxes have been
precollected by wholesalers.

Opinion of the Court

York's cigarette tax enforcement scheme went into effect,they filed separate suits in the Supreme Court in Albany

County alleging that the regulations were pre-empted by thefederal Indian Trader Statutes, 25 U. S. C. $ 261

et seq. The
trial court agreed and issued an injunction. After the Appellate Division affirmed, Milhelm Attea & Bros., Inc. v.
Dept. of Taxation and Finance of New York, 164 App. Div.
2d 300, 564 N. Y. S. 2d 491 (1990), and the New York Courtof Appeals denied review, we granted certiorari, vacated the

judgment of the Appellate Division, and remanded for fur-ther consideration in the light of our decision in

Oklahoma
Tax Comm'n v. Citizen Band of Potawatomi Tribe of Okla.,
498 U. S. 505 (1991). 502 U. S. 1053 (1992). On remand, the
Appellate Division upheld the regulations, 181 App. Div. 2d
210, 585 N. Y. S. 2d 847 (1992), but the Court of Appeals
reversed, 81 N. Y. 2d 417, 615 N. E. 2d 994 (1993).

The Court of Appeals distinguished our decisions holding
that a State may require Indian retailers to collect a tax
imposed on non-Indian purchasers of cigarettes, see Moe v.
Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Flathead Reservation, 425 U. S. 463 (1976); Washington v. Confederated
Tribes of Colville Reservation, 447 U. S. 134 (1980), on the
ground that those cases involved the regulation of sales
to non-Indian consumers. 81 N. Y. 2d, at 425, 615 N. E. 2d,
at 997. In the Court of Appeals' view, this case was significantly different because New York's regulations apply
to sales by non-Indian wholesalers to reservation Indians.
Ibid. The court concluded that the Indian Trader Statutes,
as construed in Warren Trading Post Co. v. Arizona Tax
Comm'n, 380 U. S. 685 (1965), deprived the States of all
power to impose regulatory burdens on licensed Indian traders. 81 N. Y. 2d, at 426-427, 615 N. E. 2d, at 997-998. Even
if States could impose minimal burdens on Indian traders,
the Court of Appeals alternatively held, New York's regulations are nevertheless invalid because they "impose significant burdens on the wholesaler." Id., at 427, 615 N. E. 2d,

Opinion of the Court
at 998. In particular, the regulations "dictate to Indian
traders the number of unstamped cigarettes they can sell to
reservation Indians and direct with whom they may trade."
Ibid. Moreover, New York's scheme "requires wholesale
distributors to prepay taxes on all cigarettes delivered on
the reservations in excess of the predetermined maximum
amount and, with respect to those cigarettes, imposes a sales
tax on Indian retailers." Ibid.

We granted certiorari, 510 U. S. 943 (1993), and now
reverse.

III

Respondents' challenge to New York's regulatory scheme
is essentially a facial one. In reviewing a challenge of this
kind, we do not rest our decision on consequences that, while
possible, are by no means predictable. For example, respondents do not contest the factual accuracy of the Department's initial calculations of "probable demand" for taxexempt cigarettes at particular reservations, see Record
244-248; rather, they challenge the Department's authority
to impose such limits at all. Therefore, for present purposes
we must assume that the allocations for each reservation will
be sufficiently generous to satisfy the legitimate demands of
those reservation Indians who smoke cigarettes. In other
respects as well, we confine ourselves to those alleged defects that inhere in the regulations as written.

A second limitation on our review flows from the nature
of respondents' challenge. Their claim is that the New York
scheme interferes with their federally protected activities as
Indian traders who sell goods at wholesale to reservation
Indians. While the effect of the New York scheme on Indian
retailers and consumers may be relevant to that inquiry, see
Warren Trading Post, 380 U. S., at 691, this case does not
require us to assess for all purposes each feature of New
York's tax enforcement scheme that might affect tribal selfgovernment or federal authority over Indian affairs. Here

Opinion of the Court

we confront the narrower question whether the New Yorkscheme is inconsistent with the Indian Trader Statutes.

IV
Throughout this Nation's history, Congress has authorized"sweeping" and "comprehensive federal regulation" over

persons who wish to trade with Indians and Indian tribes.
Warren Trading Post, 380 U. S., at 687-689. An exercise ofCongress' power to "regulate Commerce . . . with the Indian

Tribes," see U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3, the Indian TraderStatutes were enacted to prevent fraud and other abuses by
persons trading with Indians. See Central Machinery Co.v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, 448 U. S. 160, 163-164 (1980). The
provision principally relied upon by respondents and by theCourt of Appeals, enacted in 1876 and captioned "Power to
appoint traders with Indians," states:

"The Commissioner of Indian Affairs shall have the solepower and authority to appoint traders to the Indian

tribes and to make such rules and regulations as he maydeem just and proper specifying the kind and quantity
of goods and the prices at which such goods shall be soldto the Indians." 19 Stat. 200, 25 U. S. C. $ 261.

7

In Warren Trading Post, we held that this provision pre-vented Arizona from imposing a tax on the income or gross
sales proceeds of licensed Indian traders dealing with res-ervation Indians. The Indian Trader Statutes and the "apparently all-inclusive regulations" under them, we stated,"would seem in themselves sufficient to show that Congress
has taken the business of Indian trading on reservations so

7 The other Indian trader provisions state that persons who establish
their fitness to trade with Indians to the BIA's satisfaction shall be permitted to do so, 25 U. S. C. $ 262, authorize the President to prohibit the introduction of goods into Indian country and to revoke licenses, $ 263, and
impose penalties for unauthorized trading, $ 264. BIA regulations under
the statutes are codified at 25 CFR $$ 140.1-140.26 (1993).

fully in hand that no room remains for state laws imposingadditional burdens upon traders." 380 U. S., at 690.

Therefore, Arizona's tax "would to a substantial extent frus-trate the evident congressional purpose of ensuring that no
burden shall be imposed upon Indian traders for trading with
Indians on reservations except as authorized by Acts of Con-gress or by valid regulations promulgated under those Acts."

Id., at 691. See also Central Machinery Co., 448 U. S., at163-166 (tax on proceeds of sale of farm machinery to tribe
pre-empted by $ 261).Although language in

Warren Trading Post suggests that
no state regulation of Indian traders can be valid, our subsequent decisions have "undermine[d]" that proposition. See
Central Machinery, 448 U. S., at 172 (Powell, J., dissenting).
Thus, in Moe, we upheld a Montana law that required Indian
retailers on tribal land to collect a state cigarette tax imposed on sales to non-Indian consumers. We noted that the
Indian smokeshop proprietor's competitive advantage over
other retailers depended "on the extent to which the nonIndian purchaser is willing to flout his legal obligation to pay
the tax. Without the simple expedient of having the retailer collect the sales tax from non-Indian purchasers, it is
clear that wholesale violations of the law by the latter class
will go virtually unchecked." 425 U. S., at 482. In contrast
to the tax in Warren Trading Post, which fell directly upon
an Indian trader, the cigarette tax in Moe fell upon a class--
non-Indians--whom the State had power to tax. 425 U. S.,
at 483. We approved Montana's "requirement that the Indian tribal seller collect a tax validly imposed on nonIndians" as a "minimal burden designed to avoid the likelihood that in its absence non-Indians purchasing from the
tribal seller will avoid payment of a concededly lawful tax."
Ibid.

In Colville, we upheld in relevant part a more comprehensive Washington State cigarette tax enforcement scheme
that required tribal retailers selling goods on the reservation

Opinion of the Court

to collect taxes on sales to nonmembers and to keep extensive records concerning these transactions. We rejected the
proposition that "principles of federal Indian law, whether
stated in terms of pre-emption, tribal self-government, or
otherwise, authorize Indian tribes thus to market an exemption from state taxation to persons who would normally do
their business elsewhere." 447 U. S., at 155. Moreover, the
Tribes had failed to meet their burden of showing that the
recordkeeping requirements imposed on tribal retailers were
"not reasonably necessary as a means of preventing fraudulent transactions." Id., at 160.8 See also California Bd.
of Equalization v. Chemehuevi Tribe, 474 U. S. 9, 11-12
(1985) (per curiam).

In Potawatomi, we held that sovereign immunity barred
the State of Oklahoma's suit against a Tribe to recover cigarette taxes owed for sales to non-Indians at a convenience
store owned by the Tribe. In response to the State's protest
that the Tribe's immunity from suit made the State's recognized authority to tax cigarette sales to non-Indians a "right
without any remedy," 498 U. S., at 514, we explained that
alternative remedies existed for state tax collectors, such as
damages actions against individual tribal officers or agreements with the tribes. Ibid. We added that "States may
of course collect the sales tax from cigarette wholesalers,
either by seizing unstamped cigarettes off the reservation,
Colville, [447 U. S.,] at 161-162, or by assessing wholesalers

8 We described the recordkeeping requirements as follows:
"The state sales tax scheme requires smokeshop operators to keep detailed records of both taxable and nontaxable transactions. The operator
must record the number and dollar volume of taxable sales to nonmembers
of the Tribe. With respect to nontaxable sales, the operator must record
and retain for state inspection the names of all Indian purchasers, their
tribal affiliations, the Indian reservations within which sales are made,
and the dollar amount and dates of sales. In addition, unless the Indian
purchaser is personally known to the operator he must present a tribal
identification card." Colville, 447 U. S., at 159.

who supplied unstamped cigarettes to the tribal stores."Ibid.

V
This is another case in which we must "reconcile the ple-nary power of the States over residents within their borders

with the semi-autonomous status of Indians living on tribalreservations."

McClanahan v. Arizona Tax Comm'n, 411U. S. 164, 165 (1973). Resolution of conflicts of this kind

does not depend on "rigid rule[s]" or on "mechanical or abso-lute conceptions of state or tribal sovereignty," but instead
on "a particularized inquiry into the nature of the state, fed-eral, and tribal interests at stake, an inquiry designed to
determine whether, in the specific context, the exercise ofstate authority would violate federal law."

White Moun-tain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U. S. 136, 142, 145 (1980).

See also Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U. S.163, 176 (1989).

The specific kind of state tax obligation that New York'sregulations are designed to enforce--which falls on nonIndian purchasers of goods that are merely retailed on a res-ervation--stands on a markedly different footing from a tax
imposed directly on Indian traders, on enrolled tribal mem-bers or tribal organizations, or on "value generated on the
reservation by activities involving the Tribes," Colville, 447U. S., at 156-157. Moe, Colville, and Potawatomi make
clear that the States have a valid interest in ensuring compli-ance with lawful taxes that might easily be evaded through
purchases of tax-exempt cigarettes on reservations; that in-terest outweighs tribes' modest interest in offering a tax exemption to customers who would ordinarily shop elsewhere.The "balance of state, federal, and tribal interests,"

Rice v.Rehner, 463 U. S. 713, 720 (1983), in this area thus leaves

more room for state regulation than in others. In particu-lar, these cases have decided that States may impose on reservation retailers minimal burdens reasonably tailored to thecollection of valid taxes from non-Indians.

74 DEPARTMENT OF TAXATION AND FINANCE OF N. Y. v.

MILHELM ATTEA & BROS.

Opinion of the Court

Although Moe and Colville dealt most directly with claims
of interference with tribal sovereignty,9 the reasoning of
those decisions requires rejection of the submission that 25
U. S. C. $ 261 bars any and all state-imposed burdens on Indian traders. It would be anomalous to hold that a State
could impose tax collection and bookkeeping burdens on reservation retailers who are themselves enrolled tribal members, including stores operated by the tribes themselves, but
that similar burdens could not be imposed on wholesalers,
who often (as in this case) are not.10 Such a ruling might
well have the perverse consequence of casting greater state
tax enforcement burdens on the very reservation Indians
whom the Indian Trader Statutes were enacted to protect.
Just as tribal sovereignty does not completely preclude
States from enlisting tribal retailers to assist enforcement of
valid state taxes, the Indian Trader Statutes do not bar the
States from imposing reasonable regulatory burdens upon
Indian traders for the same purpose. A regulation designed
to prevent non-Indians from evading taxes may well burden
Indian traders in the sense that it reduces the competitive
advantage offered by trading unlimited quantities of tax-free
goods; but that consideration is no more weighty in the case
of Indian traders engaged in wholesale transactions than it
was in the case of reservation retailers.

The state law we found pre-empted in Warren Trading
Post was a tax directly "imposed upon Indian traders for
trading with Indians." 380 U. S., at 691. See also Central
Machinery, 448 U. S., at 164. That characterization does

9 In fact, in Colville, the tribal retailers obligated to collect state taxes
on cigarette sales to non-Indians and keep detailed sales records were
licensed Indian traders. See Confederated Tribes of Colville v. State of
Wash., 446 F. Supp. 1339, 1347 (ED Wash. 1978).

10 According to the Federal Government, there are approximately 125

federally licensed Indian traders in New York, of whom the 64 wholesalers
are all non-Indians and the 61 retailers are all Indians. See Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae 2, n. 1.

Opinion of the Court
not apply to regulations designed to prevent circumventionof "concededly lawful" taxes owed by non-Indians. See

Moe, 425 U. S., at 482-483. Although broad language in ouropinion in Warren Trading Post lends support to a contrary
conclusion, we now hold that Indian traders are not whollyimmune from state regulation that is reasonably necessary
to the assessment or collection of lawful state taxes. Thatconclusion does not, of course, answer the Court of Appeals'
alternative basis for striking down the New York scheme--namely, that it imposes

excessive burdens on Indian traders.

VI
Respondents vigorously object to the limitation of whole-saler's tax-exempt cigarette sales through the "probable demand" mechanism. We are persuaded, however, that NewYork's decision to stanch the illicit flow of tax-free cigarettes
early in the distribution stream is a "reasonably necessary"method of "preventing fraudulent transactions," one that
"polices against wholesale evasion of [New York's] own validtaxes without unnecessarily intruding on core tribal interests." Colville, 447 U. S., at 160, 162. The sole purposeand justification for the quotas on untaxed cigarettes is the
State's legitimate interest in avoiding tax evasion by non-Indian consumers. By imposing a quota on

tax-free ciga-rettes, New York has not sought to dictate "the kind and

quantity of goods and the prices at which such goods shallbe sold to the Indians." 25 U. S. C. $ 261. Indian traders
remain free to sell Indian tribes and retailers as many ciga-rettes as they wish, of any kind and at whatever price. If
the Department's "probable demand" calculations are ade-quate, tax-immune Indians will not have to pay New York
cigarette taxes and neither wholesalers nor retailers willhave to precollect taxes on cigarettes destined for their consumption. While the possibility of an inadequate quota mayprovide the basis for a future challenge to the

application ofthe regulations, we are unwilling to assume, in the absence

76 DEPARTMENT OF TAXATION AND FINANCE OF N. Y. v.

MILHELM ATTEA & BROS.

Opinion of the Court

of any such showing by respondents, that New York will underestimate the legitimate demand for tax-free cigarettes.
The associated requirement that the Department preapprove
deliveries of tax-exempt cigarettes in order to ensure compliance with the quotas does not render the scheme facially
invalid. This procedure should not prove unduly burdensome absent wrongful withholding or delay of approval--
problems that can be addressed if and when they arise. See
Colville, 447 U. S., at 160 (burden of showing that tax enforcement scheme imposes excessive regulatory burdens is
on challenger).

New York's requirements that wholesalers sell untaxed
cigarettes only to persons who can produce valid exemption
certificates and that wholesalers maintain detailed records
on tax-exempt transactions likewise do not unduly interfere
with Indian trading. The recordkeeping requirements and
eligible buyer restrictions in the New York scheme are no
more demanding than the comparable measures we approved
in Colville. See n. 8, supra. Indeed, because wholesale
trade typically involves a comparatively small number of
large-volume sales, the transactional recordkeeping requirements imposed on Indian traders in this case are probably
less onerous than those imposed on retailers in Moe and Colville. By requiring wholesalers to precollect taxes on, and
affix stamps to, cigarettes destined for nonexempt consumers, New York has simply imposed on the wholesaler the
same precollection obligation that, under Moe and Colville,
may be imposed on reservation retailers. We therefore disagree with the Court of Appeals' conclusion that New York
has in this way "impose[d] a sales tax on Indian retailers."
81 N. Y. 2d, at 427, 615 N. E. 2d, at 998 (emphasis added).
Again assuming that the "probable demand" calculations
leave ample room for legitimately tax-exempt sales, the precollection regime will not require prepayment of any tax to
which New York is not entitled.

Opinion of the Court
The United States, as amicus supporting affirmance,
agrees with the Court of Appeals' alternative holding that
the New York scheme improperly burdens Indian trading.
In addition to the provisions disapproved by the Court of
Appeals, the United States attacks the requirement that reservation retailers obtain state tax exemption certificates on
the ground that it invades the BIA's "sole power and authority" to appoint Indian traders. We do not, however, understand the regulations to do anything more than establish a
method of identifying those retailers who are already engaged in the business of selling cigarettes. At this stage,
we will not assume that the Department would refuse certification to any federally authorized trader or stultify tribal
economies by refusing certification to new reservation retailers. Indeed, the Department assures us that certification
is "virtually automatic" upon submission of an application.

The United States also objects to the provisions for establishing "trade territories" and allocating each reservation's
overall quota among its retail outlets. Depending upon how
they are applied in particular circumstances, these provisions may present significant problems to be addressed in
some future proceeding. However, the record before us furnishes no basis for identifying or evaluating any such problem. Agreements between the Department and individual
tribes might avoid or resolve problems that are now purely
hypothetical.11 Possible problems involving the allocation of

regulations allow New York to tax any transactions occurring on Seneca
tribal lands. See Brief for Seneca Nation of Indians as Amicus Curiae
18-26; but see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 21-24. We do
not address this contention, which differs markedly from respondents'
position and which was not addressed by the Court of Appeals. See

cigarettes among reservation retailers would not necessarilythreaten any harm to respondent wholesalers, whose main

interest lies in selling the maximum number of cigarettes,however ultimately allocated.

Because we conclude that New York's cigarette tax en-forcement regulations do not, on their face, violate the Indian

O'MELVENY & MYERS v. FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION, as receiver for AMERICAN DIVERSIFIED SAVINGS BANK, et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 93-489. Argued March 21, 1994--Decided June 13, 1994
Respondent Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), receiver for

an insolvent California savings and loan (S&L), caused the S&L to make
refunds to investors in certain fraudulent real estate syndications in
which the S&L had been represented by petitioner law firm. The
FDIC filed suit against petitioner in the Federal District Court and
alleged state causes of action for professional negligence and breach of
fiduciary duty. Petitioner moved for summary judgment, alleging,
inter alia, that knowledge of the fraudulent conduct of the S&L's officers must be imputed to the S&L, and hence to the FDIC, which, as
receiver, stood in the S&L's shoes; and thus the FDIC was estopped
from pursuing its tort claims. The court granted the motion, but the
Court of Appeals reversed, indicating that a federal common-law rule
of decision controlled.

Held: The California rule of decision, rather than a federal rule, governs

petitioner's tort liability. Pp. 83-89.

(a) State law governs the imputation of corporate officers' knowledge
to a corporation that is asserting causes of action created by state law.
There is no federal general common law, Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304
U. S. 64, 78, and the remote possibility that corporations may go into
federal receivership is no conceivable basis for adopting a special federal
common-law rule divesting States of authority over the entire law of
imputation. Pp. 83-85.

(b) California law also governs the narrower question whether corporate officers' knowledge can be imputed to the FDIC suing as receiver.
This Court will not adopt a judge-made federal rule to supplement comprehensive and detailed federal statutory regulation; matters left unaddressed in such a scheme are presumably left to state law. Title 12
U. S. C. $ 1821(d)(2)(A)(i)--which states that "the [FDIC] shall, . . . by
operation of law, succeed to--all rights, titles, powers, and privileges of
the insured depository institution"--places the FDIC in the insolvent
S&L's shoes to pursue its claims under state law, except where some

form, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) specifically
creates a special federal rule of decision. Pp. 85-87.

(c) Judicial creation of a special federal rule would not be justified
even if FIRREA is inapplicable to the instant receivership, which began
in 1986. Instances where a special federal rule is warranted are few
and restricted, limited to situations where there is a significant conflict
between some federal policy or interest and the use of state law. The
FDIC has identified no significant conflict here, not even one implicating
the most lightly invoked federal interest: uniformity. Pp. 87-89.

Opinion of the Court
ally insured bank, it is a federal-law or rather a state-law
rule of decision that governs the tort liability of attorneys
who provided services to the bank.

I
American Diversified Savings Bank (ADSB or S&L) is a
California-chartered and federally insured savings and loan.
The following facts have been stipulated to, or are uncontroverted, by the parties to the case, and we assume them to
be true for purposes of our decision. ADSB was acquired
in 1983 by Ranbir Sahni and Lester Day, who respectively
obtained 96% and 4% of its stock, and who respectively
served as its chairman/CEO and president. Under their
leadership, ADSB engaged in many risky real estate transactions, principally through limited partnerships sponsored by
ADSB and its subsidiaries. Together, Sahni and Day also
fraudulently overvalued ADSB's assets, engaged in sham
sales of assets to create inflated "profits," and generally
"cooked the books" to disguise the S&L's dwindling (and
eventually negative) net worth.

In September 1985, petitioner O'Melveny & Myers, a Los
Angeles-based law firm, represented ADSB in connection
with two real estate syndications. At that time, ADSB was
under investigation by state and federal regulators, but that
fact had not been made public. In completing its work for
the S&L, petitioner did not contact the accounting firms that
had previously done work for ADSB, nor state and federal
regulatory authorities, to inquire about ADSB's financial
status. The two real estate offerings on which petitioner
worked closed on December 31, 1985. On February 14, 1986,
federal regulators concluded that ADSB was insolvent and
that it had incurred substantial losses because of violations
of law and unsound business practices. Respondent stepped

82 O'MELVENY & MYERS v. FDIC

Opinion of the Court
in as receiver for ADSB,1 and on February 19, 1986, filed suit
against Messrs. Sahni and Day in Federal District Court,
alleging breach of fiduciary duty and, as to Sahni, Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act violations. Soon
after taking over as receiver, respondent began receiving demands for refunds from investors who claimed that they had
been deceived in connection with the two real estate syndications. Respondent caused ADSB to rescind the syndications and to return all of the investors' money plus interest.

On May 12, 1989, respondent sued petitioner in the United
States District Court for the Central District of California,
alleging professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty.
The parties stipulated to certain facts and petitioner moved
for summary judgment, arguing that (1) it owed no duty to
ADSB or its affiliates to uncover the S&L's own fraud; (2)
that knowledge of the conduct of ADSB's controlling officers
must be imputed to the S&L, and hence to respondent,
which, as receiver, stood in the shoes of the S&L; and (3)
that respondent was estopped from pursuing its tort claims
against petitioner because of the imputed knowledge. On
May 15, 1990, the District Court granted summary judgment, explaining only that petitioner was "entitled to judgment in its favor . . . as a matter of law." The Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, on grounds that we
shall discuss below. 969 F. 2d 744 (1992). Petitioner filed a
petition for writ of certiorari, which we granted. 510 U. S.
989 (1993).

1 For simplicity's sake, we refer to a "receiver" throughout, which we
identify as the FDIC. The reality was more complicated. The first federal entity involved was the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), which was appointed conservator of ADSB in 1986 and receiver in June 1988. The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and
Enforcement Act of 1989, Pub. L. 101-73, 103 Stat. 183, abolished FSLIC,
and caused FDIC, the manager of the FSLIC resolution fund, to be substituted as receiver and party to this case. See id., $$ 215, 401(a)(1),
401(f)(2).

Opinion of the Court

II
It is common ground that the FDIC was asserting in thiscase causes of action created by California law. Respondent

contends that in the adjudication of those causes of action (1)a federal common-law rule and not California law determines
whether the knowledge of corporate officers acting againstthe corporation's interest will be imputed to the corporation;
and (2) even if California law determines the former ques-tion, federal common law determines the more narrow question whether knowledge by officers so acting will be imputedto the FDIC when it sues as receiver of the corporation.

2

The first of these contentions need not detain us long, asit is so plainly wrong. "There is no federal general common

law," Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 78 (1938), and(to anticipate somewhat a point we will elaborate more fully
in connection with respondent's second contention) the re-mote possibility that corporations may go into federal receivership is no conceivable basis for adopting a special federalcommon-law rule divesting States of authority over the entire law of imputation. See Bank of America Nat. Trust &
Sav. Assn. v. Parnell, 352 U. S. 29, 33-34 (1956). The NinthCircuit believed that its conclusion on this point was in harmony with Schacht v. Brown, 711 F. 2d 1343 (CA7 1983),Cenco Inc. v. Seidman & Seidman, 686 F. 2d 449 (CA7 1982),
and In re Investors Funding Corp. of N. Y. Securities Litigation, 523 F. Supp. 533 (SDNY 1980), 969 F. 2d, at 750, buteven a cursory examination of those cases shows the contrary. In Cenco, where the cause of action similarly aroseunder state common law, the Seventh Circuit's analysis of

2 The Court of Appeals appears to have agreed with the first of these
contentions. Instead of the second, however, it embraced the proposition
that federal common law prevents the attributed knowledge of corporate
officers acting against the corporation's interest from being used as the
basis for an estoppel defense against the FDIC as receiver. Since there
is nothing but a formalistic distinction between this argument and the
second one described in text, we do not treat it separately.

Opinion of the Court
the "circumstances under which the knowledge of fraud on
the part of the plaintiff 's directors [would] be imputed to the
plaintiff corporation [was] merely an attempt to divine how
Illinois courts would decide that issue." Schacht, supra, at
1347 (citing Cenco, supra, at 455). Likewise, in Investors
Funding, the District Court analyzed the potential affirmative defenses to the state-law claims by applying "[t]he controlling legal principles [of] New York law." 523 F. Supp.,
at 540. In Schacht, the Seventh Circuit expressly noted that
"the cause of action [at issue] arises under RICO, a federal
statute; we therefore write on a clean slate and may bring
to bear federal policies in deciding the estoppel question."
711 F. 2d, at 1347.

In seeking to defend the Ninth Circuit's holding, respondent contends (to quote the caption of its argument) that "The
Wrongdoing Of ADSB's Insiders Would Not Be Imputed To
ADSB Under Generally Accepted Common Law Principles,"
Brief for Respondent 12--in support of which it attempts
to show that nonattribution to the corporation of dishonest
officers' knowledge is the rule applied in the vast bulk of
decisions from 43 jurisdictions, ranging from Rhode Island
to Wyoming. See, e. g., id., at 21-22, n. 9 (distinguishing,
inter alia, Cook v. American Tubing & Webbing Co., 28 R. I.
41, 65 A. 641 (1905), and American Nat. Bank of Powell v.
Foodbasket, 497 P. 2d 546 (Wyo. 1972)). The supposed relevance of this is set forth in a footnote: "It is our position
that federal common law does govern this issue, but that the
content of the federal common law rule corresponds to the
rule that would independently be adopted by most jurisdictions." Brief for Respondent 15, n. 3. If there were a federal common law on such a generalized issue (which there is
not), we see no reason why it would necessarily conform to
that "independently . . . adopted by most jurisdictions." But
the short of the matter is that California law, not federal law,
governs the imputation of knowledge to corporate victims of

85Cite as: 512 U. S. 79 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
alleged negligence, and that is so whether or not California
chooses to follow "the majority rule."

We turn, then, to the more substantial basis for the decision below, which asserts federal pre-emption not over the
law of imputation generally, but only over its application to
the FDIC suing as receiver. Respondent begins its defense
of this principle by quoting United States v. Kimbell Foods,
Inc., 440 U. S. 715, 726 (1979), to the effect that "federal law
governs questions involving the rights of the United States
arising under nationwide federal programs." But the FDIC
is not the United States, and even if it were we would be
begging the question to assume that it was asserting its own
rights rather than, as receiver, the rights of ADSB. In any
event, knowing whether "federal law governs" in the Kimbell Foods sense--a sense which includes federal adoption of
state-law rules, see id., at 727-729--does not much advance
the ball. The issue in the present case is whether the California rule of decision is to be applied to the issue of imputation or displaced, and if it is applied it is of only theoretical
interest whether the basis for that application is California's
own sovereign power or federal adoption of California's disposition. See Boyle v. United Technologies Corp., 487 U. S.
500, 507, n. 3 (1988).

In answering the central question of displacement of California law, we of course would not contradict an explicit federal statutory provision. Nor would we adopt a court-made
rule to supplement federal statutory regulation that is comprehensive and detailed; matters left unaddressed in such a
scheme are presumably left subject to the disposition provided by state law. See Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers, 451 U. S. 77, 97 (1981); Milwaukee v. Illinois,
451 U. S. 304, 319 (1981). Petitioner asserts that both these
principles apply in the present case, by reason of 12 U. S. C.

$ 1821(d)(2)(A)(i) (1988 ed., Supp. IV), and the comprehensive
legislation of which it is a part, the Financial Institutions

Section 1821(d)(2)(A)(i), which is part of a title captioned"Powers and duties of [the FDIC] as . . . receiver," states
that "the [FDIC] shall, . . . by operation of law, succeed to--
all rights, titles, powers, and privileges of the insured deposi-tory institution . . . ." 12 U. S. C. $ 1821(d)(2)(A)(i) (1988 ed.,

Supp. IV). This language appears to indicate that the FDICas receiver "steps into the shoes" of the failed S&L, cf.

Coit
Independence Joint Venture v. FSLIC, 489 U. S. 561, 585(1989), obtaining the rights "

of the insured depository institution" that existed prior to receivership. Thereafter, in
litigation by the FDIC asserting the claims of the S&L--
in this case California tort claims potentially defeasible by
a showing that the S&L's officers had knowledge--" `any
defense good against the original party is good against the
receiver.' " 969 F. 2d, at 751 (quoting Allen v. Ramsay,

179 Cal. App. 2d 843, 854, 4 Cal. Rptr. 575, 583 (1960)).

Respondent argues that $ 1821(d)(2)(A)(i) should be read
as a nonexclusive grant of rights to the FDIC receiver,
which can be supplemented or modified by federal common
law; and that FIRREA as a whole, by demonstrating the
high federal interest in this area, confirms the courts' authority to promulgate such common law. This argument is demolished by those provisions of FIRREA which specifically
create special federal rules of decision regarding claims by,
and defenses against, the FDIC as receiver. See 12 U. S. C.

$ 1821(d)(14) (1988 ed., Supp. IV) (extending statute of limitations beyond period that might exist under state law);

$$ 1821(e)(1), (3) (precluding state-law claims against the
FDIC under certain contracts it is authorized to repudiate);

$ 1821(k) (permitting claims against directors and officers for
gross negligence, regardless of whether state law would require greater culpability); $ 1821(d)(9) (excluding certain
state-law claims against FDIC based on oral agreements by
the S&L). Inclusio unius, exclusio alterius. It is hard to

87Cite as: 512 U. S. 79 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
avoid the conclusion that $ 1821(d)(2)(A)(i) places the FDICin the shoes of the insolvent S&L, to work out its claims

under state law, except where some provision in the exten-sive framework of FIRREA provides otherwise. To create
additional "federal common-law" exceptions is not to "supplement" this scheme, but to alter it.We have thought it necessary to resolve the effect of

FIRREA because respondent argued that the statute notonly did not prevent but positively authorized federal common law. We are reluctant to rest our judgment onFIRREA alone, however, since that statute was enacted into
law in 1989, while respondent took over as receiver for
ADSB in 1986. The FDIC is willing to "assume . . . that
FIRREA would have taken effect in time to be relevant to
this case," Brief for Respondent 35, n. 21, but it is not selfevident that that assumption is correct. See Landgraf v.
USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 268-270, 274 (1994); cf. id.,
at 290-291 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). It seems to
us imprudent to resolve the retroactivity question without
briefing, and inefficient to pretermit the retroactivity issue
on the basis of the FDIC's concession, since that would make
our decision of limited value in other cases. As we proceed
to explain, even assuming the inapplicability of FIRREA
this is not one of those cases in which judicial creation of a
special federal rule would be justified.

Such cases are, as we have said in the past, "few and restricted," Wheeldin v. Wheeler, 373 U. S. 647, 651 (1963),
limited to situations where there is a "significant conflict between some federal policy or interest and the use of state
law." Wallis v. Pan American Petroleum Corp., 384 U. S.

63, 68 (1966). Our cases uniformly require the existence of
such a conflict as a precondition for recognition of a federal
rule of decision. See, e. g., Kamen v. Kemper Financial
Services, Inc., 500 U. S. 90, 98 (1991); Boyle, supra, at 508;
Kimbell Foods, 440 U. S., at 728. Not only the permissibility
but also the scope of judicial displacement of state rules

512us1$70K 12-24-97 08:21:07 PAGES OPINPGT
88 O'MELVENY & MYERS v. FDIC

Opinion of the Court
turns upon such a conflict. See, e. g., Kamen, supra, at 98;
Boyle, supra, at 508. What is fatal to respondent's position
in the present case is that it has identified no significant conflict with an identifiable federal policy or interest. There is
not even at stake that most generic (and lightly invoked) of
alleged federal interests, the interest in uniformity. The
rules of decision at issue here do not govern the primary
conduct of the United States or any of its agents or contractors, but affect only the FDIC's rights and liabilities, as receiver, with respect to primary conduct on the part of private actors that has already occurred. Uniformity of law
might facilitate the FDIC's nationwide litigation of these
suits, eliminating state-by-state research and reducing uncertainty--but if the avoidance of those ordinary consequences qualified as an identifiable federal interest, we would
be awash in "federal common-law" rules. See United States
v. Yazell, 382 U. S. 341, 347, n. 13 (1966).

The closest respondent comes to identifying a specific, concrete federal policy or interest that is compromised by California law is its contention that state rules regarding the
imputation of knowledge might "deplet[e] the deposit insurance fund," Brief for Respondent 32. But neither FIRREA
nor the prior law sets forth any anticipated level for the fund,
so what respondent must mean by "depletion" is simply the
forgoing of any money which, under any conceivable legal
rules, might accrue to the fund. That is a broad principle
indeed, which would support not just elimination of the defense at issue here, but judicial creation of new, "federalcommon-law" causes of action to enrich the fund. Of course
we have no authority to do that, because there is no federal
policy that the fund should always win. Our cases have
previously rejected "more money" arguments remarkably
similar to the one made here. See Kimbell Foods, supra, at
737-738; Yazell, supra, at 348; cf. Robertson v. Wegmann,
436 U. S. 584, 593 (1978).

Opinion of the Court
Even less persuasive--indeed, positively probative of the
dangers of respondent's facile approach to federal-commonlaw-making--is respondent's contention that it would "disserve the federal program" to permit California to insulate
"the attorney's or accountant's malpractice," thereby imposing costs "on the nation's taxpayers, rather than on the negligent wrongdoer." Brief for Respondent 32. By presuming
to judge what constitutes malpractice, this argument demonstrates the runaway tendencies of "federal common law" untethered to a genuinely identifiable (as opposed to judicially
constructed) federal policy. What sort of tort liability to impose on lawyers and accountants in general, and on lawyers
and accountants who provide services to federally insured
financial institutions in particular, " `involves a host of considerations that must be weighed and appraised,' " Northwest
Airlines, Inc., 451 U. S., at 98, n. 41 (quoting United States
v. Gilman, 347 U. S. 507, 512-513 (1954))--including, for example, the creation of incentives for careful work, provision
of fair treatment to third parties, assurance of adequate recovery by the federal deposit insurance fund, and enablement of reasonably priced services. Within the federal system, at least, we have decided that that function of weighing
and appraising " `is more appropriately for those who write
the laws, rather than for those who interpret them.' " Northwest Airlines, supra, at 98, n. 41 (quoting Gilman, supra,
at 513).

We conclude that this is not one of those extraordinary
cases in which the judicial creation of a federal rule of
decision is warranted. As noted earlier, the parties are
in agreement that if state law governs it is the law of California; but they vigorously disagree as to what that law
provides. We leave it to the Ninth Circuit to resolve that
point. The judgment is reversed and the case remanded
for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

So ordered.

While I join the Court's opinion, I add this comment toemphasize an important difference between federal courts

and state courts. It would be entirely proper for a statecourt of general jurisdiction to fashion a rule of agency law
that would protect creditors of an insolvent corporation fromthe consequences of wrongdoing by corporate officers even if
the corporation itself, or its shareholders, would be bound bythe acts of its agents. Indeed, a state court might well attach special significance to the fact that the interests of taxpayers as well as ordinary creditors will be affected by therule at issue in this case. Federal courts, however, "unlike

their state counterparts, are courts of limited jurisdiction
that have not been vested with open-ended lawmaking pow-ers."

U. S. 77, 95 (1981). Because state law provides the basis forrespondent FDIC's claim, that law also governs both the elements of the cause of action and its defenses. Unless Con-gress has otherwise directed, the federal court's task is
merely to interpet and apply the relevant rules of state law.Cases like this one, however, present a special problem.
They raise issues, such as the imputation question here, that
may not have been definitively settled in the state jurisdic-tion in which the case is brought, but that nevertheless must

be resolved by federal courts. The task of the federaljudges who confront such issues would surely be simplified
if Congress had provided them with a uniform federal ruleto apply. As matters stand, however, federal judges must
do their best to estimate how the relevant state courts wouldperform their lawmaking task, and then emulate that sometimes purely hypothetical model. The Court correctly
avoids any suggestion about how the merits of the imputa-tion issue should be resolved on remand or in similar cases

that may arise elsewhere. "The federal judges who deal

HOWLETT v. BIRKDALE SHIPPING CO., S. A.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 93-670. Argued April 20, 1994--Decided June 13, 1994
Petitioner Howlett, a longshoreman employed by stevedore Northern

Shipping Co., was injured when he slipped and fell on a sheet of clear
plastic that had been placed under bags he was discharging from a cargo
hold on a ship owned and operated by respondent Birkdale Shipping Co.
He filed suit against Birkdale under $ 5(b) of the Longshore and Harbor
Workers' Compensation Act, which requires shipowners to exercise ordinary care to maintain a ship and its equipment in a condition so that
an expert and experienced stevedore can load and unload cargo with
reasonable safety. As a corollary to this "turnover duty," a shipowner
must warn the stevedore of latent hazards that are known or should be
known to the shipowner. Here, the evidence showed that the vessel
had supplied the plastic to the loading stevedore in Guayaquil, Ecuador,
and that that stevedore had placed it under the bags, even though this
was improper. Howlett charged that Birkdale was negligent in failing
to warn Northern and its employees of this dangerous condition. The
District Court granted Birkdale summary judgment, finding that Howlett had not demonstrated that Birkdale had actual knowledge of the
hazardous condition, and that the condition was not open and obvious.
It declined to infer such knowledge from the fact that the vessel had
supplied the Guayaquil stevedore with the plastic or that the vessel's
crew was present during the loading operation. Even if the plastic's
improper use was apparent to the crew in Guayaquil, the court added,
then it was also an open and obvious condition for which Howlett could
not recover. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held:

1. A vessel's turnover duty to warn of latent defects in the cargo stow
is narrow. As a general rule, the duty to warn attaches only to hazards
that are not known to the stevedore and that would be neither obvious
to, nor anticipated by, a skilled stevedore in the competent performance
of its work. Scindia Steam Nav. Co. v. De los Santos, 451 U. S. 156,
167. Subjecting vessels to suit for injuries that could be so anticipated
would upset the balance Congress was careful to strike when it amended
the Act in 1972 to shift more of the responsibility for compensating
injured longshoremen to stevedores, who are best able to avoid acci512us1$71Z 12-24-97 08:23:29 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
dents during cargo operations. In addition, absent a vessel's actual
knowledge of a hazard, the turnover duty attaches only if the exercise
of reasonable care would place upon the vessel an obligation to inspect
for or discover the hazard's existence. Contrary to Howlett's submission, however, the exercise of reasonable care does not require a vessel
to supervise the ongoing operations of the loading stevedore or other
stevedores handling the cargo before it arrives in port, or to inspect the
completed stow, to discover hazards in the cargo stow. Pp. 96-105.

2. The District Court erred in resting summary judgment on the
ground that the vessel had no actual knowledge of the hazard leading to
Howlett's injury. Some crew members, who might have held positions
such that their knowledge should be attributed to the vessel, might have
observed the plastic being placed under the bags during the loading
process. The court's additional theory that the condition would have
been open and obvious to the stevedore during unloading had it been
obvious to the crew may also prove faulty, being premised on the vessel's state of affairs during loading, not discharge. Of course, the vessel
may be entitled to summary judgment, since there is evidence that the
plastic was visible during unloading, and since Howlett must demonstrate that the alleged hazard would not have been obvious to, or anticipated by, a skilled and competent stevedore at the discharge port.

condition so that an expert and experienced stevedore canload and unload cargo with reasonable safety. As a corollary

to this duty, the shipowner must warn the stevedore of latenthazards, as the term is defined in maritime law, that are
known or should be known to the shipowner. This case re-quires us to define the circumstances under which a shipowner must warn of latent hazards in the cargo stow orcargo area.

I
The case arrives after a grant of summary judgment torespondent Birkdale Shipping Co., S. A., so we consider the

facts in the light most favorable to petitioner Albert Howlett.Howlett, a longshoreman employed in the Port of Philadelphia by stevedore Northern Shipping Co., was injured whiledischarging bags of cocoa beans from a cargo hold on the MV
Presidente Ibanez, a ship owned and operated by Birkdale.During the unloading operation, Howlett and three other
longshoremen hooked up a draft, or load, of bags stowed onthe tween deck of the hold. When the ship's boom lifted the
draft out of the hold, an 8-square-foot area of the tween deckwas exposed. Howlett, who was standing on surrounding
bags, jumped down about three feet to the deck, where heslipped and fell on a sheet of clear plastic that had been
placed under the cargo. As a result of his fall, Howlett sus-tained serious injuries that have disabled him from returning to work as a longshoreman.Howlett brought suit against Birkdale under $ 5(b) of the
Act. Both parties agreed that it is customary to lay paperand plywood on a steel deck to protect a stow of cocoa beans
against condensation damage. They also agreed that, forpurposes of protecting the beans, it was improper to use
plastic, which tends to aggravate condensation damagerather than prevent it. Evidence adduced during pretrial
proceedings suggested that the independent stevedore en-gaged by Birkdale to load the beans in Guayaquil, Ecuador,
had placed the plastic on the tween deck. Further evidence

Opinion of the Court
showed that the vessel had supplied the Guayaquil stevedorewith the plastic, along with other material used in stowing

cargo, including paper, plywood, and dunnage. Howlettclaimed that before jumping to the deck he did not see the
plastic, which was covered by dirt and debris. He charged
that Birkdale was negligent in failing to warn Northern andits longshoremen-employees of this dangerous condition.

The United States District Court for the Eastern Districtof Pennsylvania granted summary judgment in favor of Birkdale. Relying upon Derr v. Kawasaki Kisen K. K., 835 F. 2d490 (CA3 1987), cert. denied, 486 U. S. 1007 (1988), the court
held that Howlett, to prevail on his failure-to-warn claim, had
to demonstrate that Birkdale had actual knowledge of the
hazardous condition and that the condition was not open and
obvious. After reviewing the record, the court concluded
that Howlett had failed to present evidence sufficient to sustain his claim. The court declined to infer that Birkdale had
actual knowledge of the condition from the fact that it had
supplied the Guayaquil stevedore with the plastic, reasoning
that "being the supplier of equipment does not necessarily
imply knowledge of its intended purpose." App. to Pet. for
Cert. 4a. The court further declined to infer actual knowledge from the fact that the members of the vessel's crew
were present on the top deck during the loading operation.
And even if the Guayaquil stevedore's improper use of plastic
had been apparent to the crew, the court continued, "then
it readily transpires that this was an open and obvious condition" for which Howlett could not recover. Ibid. The
Court of Appeals affirmed without opinion, judgt. order reported at 998 F. 2d 1003 (CA3 1993).

We granted certiorari, 510 U. S. 1039 (1994), to resolve a
conflict among the Circuits regarding the scope of the shipowners' duty to warn of latent hazards in the cargo stow, an
inquiry that depends in large part upon the nature of the
shipowners' duty to inspect for such defects. Compare Derr

U. S. 967 (1982).

II

The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act,
44 Stat. 1424, as amended, 33 U. S. C. $ 901 et seq., establishes
a comprehensive federal workers' compensation program
that provides longshoremen and their families with medical,
disability, and survivor benefits for work-related injuries and
death. See generally T. Schoenbaum, Admiralty and Maritime Law $ 6-6 (1987); M. Norris, Law of Maritime Personal
Injuries $$ 4:11, 4:22-4:29 (4th ed. 1990). The injured longshoreman's employer--in most instances, an independent
stevedore, see Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 443 U. S. 256, 263-264 (1979)--must pay the statutory benefits regardless of fault, but is shielded from any
further liability to the longshoreman. See 33 U. S. C. $$ 904,
905(a); Norris, supra, $$ 4:7-4:10.

The longshoreman also may seek damages in a third-party
negligence action against the owner of the vessel on which
he was injured, and may do so without forgoing statutory
compensation if he follows certain procedures. See Estate
of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469 (1992). Section 5(b) provides in relevant part:

"In the event of injury to a person covered under this
Act caused by the negligence of a vessel, then such person . . . may bring an action against such vessel as a
third party . . . , and the employer shall not be liable to
the vessel for such damages directly or indirectly and
any agreements or warranties to the contrary shall be
void. . . . The liability of the vessel under this subsection
shall not be based upon the warranty of seaworthiness

Opinion of the Court
or a breach thereof at the time the injury occurred." 33U. S. C. $ 905(b).

This provision, enacted as part of the extensive 1972 amend-ments to the Act, effected fundamental changes in the nature
of the third-party action. First, it abolished the longshore-man's pre-existing right to sue a shipowner based upon the
warranty of seaworthiness, a right that had been establishedin Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 328 U. S. 85 (1946). Section 5(b) also eliminated the stevedore's obligation, imposedby

Ryan Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-Atlantic S. S. Corp., 350U. S. 124 (1956), to indemnify a shipowner, if held liable to a

longshoreman, for breach of the stevedore's express or im-plied warranty to conduct cargo operations with reasonable
safety. See generally Scindia Steam Nav. Co. v. De los San-tos, 451 U. S. 156, 165 (1981); G. Gilmore & C. Black, Law
of Admiralty $ 6-57, pp. 449-455 (2d ed. 1975) (hereinafterGilmore & Black). Other sections of the 1972 amendments
provided for a substantial increase in the statutory benefitsinjured longshoremen are entitled to receive from their
stevedore-employers. See Northeast Marine Terminal Co.v.

Caputo, 432 U. S. 249, 261-262 (1977); Gilmore & Black$ 6-46, at 411; Note, 13 Tulane Mar. L. J. 163, 163-164 (1988).

The design of these changes was to shift more of the re-sponsibility for compensating injured longshoremen to the
party best able to prevent injuries: the stevedore-employer.See

Scindia Steam, 451 U. S., at 171. Subjecting vesselsto suit for injuries that could be anticipated and prevented

by a competent stevedore would threaten to upset the bal-ance Congress was careful to strike in enacting the 1972
amendments.The question whether Howlett produced evidence sufficient to hold Birkdale liable for his injuries turns on themeaning of the term "negligence" in $ 5(b). Because Congress did not "specify the acts or omissions of the vessel thatwould constitute negligence," the contours of a vessel's duty
to longshoremen are "left to be resolved through the `appli512us1$71L 12-24-97 08:23:29 PAGES OPINPGT
98 HOWLETT v. BIRKDALE SHIPPING CO.

Opinion of the Court
cation of accepted principles of tort law and the ordinaryprocess of litigation.' "

Id., at 165-166.
The starting point in this regard must be our decision in
Scindia Steam, which outlined the three general duties shipowners owe to longshoremen. The first, which courts have
come to call the "turnover duty," relates to the condition ofthe ship upon the commencement of stevedoring operations.

See id., at 167. The second duty, applicable once stevedor-ing operations have begun, provides that a shipowner must
exercise reasonable care to prevent injuries to longshoremenin areas that remain under the "active control of the vessel."
Ibid. The third duty, called the "duty to intervene," concerns the vessel's obligations with regard to cargo operations
in areas under the principal control of the independent stevedore. See id., at 167-178.

The allegations of Howlett's complaint, and the facts adduced during pretrial proceedings, implicate only the vessel's
turnover duty. We provided a brief statement of the turnover duty in Federal Marine Terminals, Inc. v. Burnside
Shipping Co., 394 U. S. 404 (1969): A vessel must "exercise
ordinary care under the circumstances" to turn over the ship
and its equipment and appliances "in such condition that an
expert and experienced stevedoring contractor, mindful of
the dangers he should reasonably expect to encounter, arising from the hazards of the ship's service or otherwise, will
be able by the exercise of ordinary care" to carry on cargo
operations "with reasonable safety to persons and property."
Id., at 416-417, n. 18 (internal quotation marks omitted); see
also Scindia Steam, 451 U. S., at 167. A corollary to the
turnover duty requires the vessel to warn the stevedore "of
any hazards on the ship or with respect to its equipment,"
so long as the hazards "are known to the vessel or should be
known to it in the exercise of reasonable care," and "would
likely be encountered by the stevedore in the course of his
cargo operations[,] are not known by the stevedore[,] and
would not be obvious to or anticipated by him if reasonably

Opinion of the Court
competent in the performance of his work." Ibid., citing
Marine Terminals, supra, at 416, n. 18. Although both
components of the turnover duty are related in various re-spects, Howlett confines his case to an allegation that Birkdale failed to warn that the tween deck was covered with
plastic rather than (as is ordinarily the case) paper andplywood.

Most turnover cases brought under $ 5(b) concern the con-dition of the ship itself or of equipment on the ship used
in stevedoring operations. See, e. g., Bjaranson v. Botelho
Shipping Corp., Manila, 873 F. 2d 1204 (CA9 1989) (no handhold on coaming ladder); Griffith v. Wheeling-Pittsburgh
Steel Corp., 610 F. 2d 116 (CA3 1979) (defective hatch covers),
remanded, 451 U. S. 965, reinstated, 657 F. 2d 25 (CA3 1981),
cert. denied, 456 U. S. 914 (1982); Scalafani v. Moore McCormack Lines, Inc., 388 F. Supp. 897 (EDNY) (no handrail on
platform linking gangway and deck), aff 'd without opinion,
535 F. 2d 1243 (CA2 1975). The turnover duty to warn, however, may extend to certain latent hazards in the cargo stow.
This is so because an improper stow can cause injuries to
longshoremen, see, e. g., Atlantic & Gulf Stevedores, Inc. v.
Ellerman Lines, Ltd., 369 U. S. 355 (1962); Ryan Stevedoring
Co. v. Pan-Atlantic S. S. Corp., 350 U. S. 124 (1956); Clay v.
Lykes Bros. S. S. Co., 525 F. Supp. 306 (ED La. 1981); The
Etna, 43 F. Supp. 303 (ED Pa. 1942), and thus is among the
"hazards on the ship" to which the duty to warn attaches.
Scindia Steam, 451 U. S., at 167.

The precise contours of the duty to warn of latent hazards
in the cargo stow must be defined with due regard to the
concurrent duties of the stevedore and to the statutory
scheme as a whole. It bears repeating that the duty attaches only to latent hazards, defined in this context as hazards that would be neither obvious to nor anticipated by a
competent stevedore in the ordinary course of cargo operations. In addition, the vessel's duty to warn is confined to
latent hazards that "are known to the vessel or should be

100 HOWLETT v. BIRKDALE SHIPPING CO.

Opinion of the Court
known to it in the exercise of reasonable care." Ibid. Ab-sent actual knowledge of a hazard, then, the duty to warn

may attach only if the exercise of reasonable care wouldplace upon the shipowner an obligation to inspect for, or discover, the hazard's existence. See Kirsch v. Plovidba, 971
F. 2d 1026, 1029 (CA3 1992) ("[T]he shipowner's duty to warnthe stevedore of hidden dangers necessarily implies a duty

to inspect to discover those dangers").Howlett, relying upon the Restatement (Second) of Torts

$ 412 (1965), maintains that a vessel's obligations in this re-gard are broad. Section 412 provides that an owner of land
or chattels who hires an independent contractor must take
reasonable steps to "ascertain whether the land or chattel is
in reasonably safe condition after the contractor's work is
completed." In light of this provision, Howlett argues that
"a shipowner, who has hired an independent contractor stevedore to perform the work of loading cargo aboard its ship,
has a duty to make `reasonable' (not continuous) inspections"
during and after cargo operations to discover dangerous conditions in the stow. Brief for Petitioner 27.

We decline to adopt Howlett's proposal. As an initial matter, we repeat our caveat that the Restatement's land-based
principles, "while not irrelevant, do not furnish sure guidance" in maritime cases brought under $ 5(b). Scindia
Steam, 451 U. S., at 168, n. 14. On a more fundamental level,
Howlett's contention that a vessel must make reasonable inspections, both during and after stevedoring operations, to
discover defects in the stow contradicts the principles underlying our decision in Scindia Steam. The plaintiff longshoreman in Scindia Steam, injured by cargo that fell from
a defective winch, alleged that the shipowner should have
intervened in the stevedoring operations and repaired the
winch before permitting operations to continue. The case
thus turned not upon the turnover duty but upon the scope
of the vessel's duty to intervene once cargo operations have
begun. We held that the duty to intervene, in the event the

512us1$71L 12-24-97 08:23:29 PAGES OPINPGT

101Cite as: 512 U. S. 92 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
vessel has no knowledge of the hazardous condition, is lim-ited: "[A]bsent contract provision, positive law, or custom to

the contrary," a vessel "has no general duty by way of super-vision or inspection to exercise reasonable care to discover
dangerous conditions that develop within the confines of the
cargo operations that are assigned to the stevedore." Id.,at 172.

The rule relieving vessels from this general duty restsupon "the justifiable expectations of the vessel that the stevedore would perform with reasonable competence and seeto the safety of the cargo operations."

Ibid.; see also Hugev
v. Dampskisaktieselskabet Int'l, 170 F. Supp. 601, 609-610
(SD Cal. 1959), aff 'd sub nom. Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v.
Dampskisaktieselskabet Int'l, 274 F. 2d 875 (CA9), cert. denied, 363 U. S. 803 (1960). These expectations derive in part
from $ 41 of the Act, 33 U. S. C. $ 941, which requires the
stevedore, as the longshoreman's employer, to provide a
"reasonably safe" place to work and to take safeguards necessary to avoid injuries. Scindia Steam, 451 U. S., at 170.
The expectations also derive from indemnity cases decided
prior to the 1972 Act, which teach that "the stevedore [is] in
the best position to avoid accidents during cargo operations"
and that "the shipowner [can] rely on the stevedore's warranty to perform competently." Id., at 171, citing Italia Societa per Azioni di Navigazione v. Oregon Stevedoring Co.,
376 U. S. 315 (1964); see also 451 U. S., at 175 (safety is "a
matter of judgment committed to the stevedore in the first
instance"). The stevedore's obligations in this regard may
not be diminished by transferring them to the vessel.

Given the legal and practical realities of the maritime
trade, we concluded in Scindia Steam that imposing a duty
upon vessels to supervise and inspect cargo operations for
the benefit of longshoremen then on board would undermine
Congress' intent in $ 5(b) to terminate the vessel's "automatic, faultless responsibility for conditions caused by the
negligence or other defaults of the stevedore," id., at 168,

512us1$71L 12-24-97 08:23:29 PAGES OPINPGT
102 HOWLETT v. BIRKDALE SHIPPING CO.

Opinion of the Court
and to foreclose liability "based on a theory of unseaworthi-ness or nondelegable duty,"

id., at 172. Agreeing with the
Court, Justice Powell further observed that imposing such aduty--in light of the stevedore-employer's right to receive

reimbursement for its payment of statutory compensation if
a longshoreman prevails in a $ 5(b) action against a vessel,see

Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 443
U. S., at 269-270--would "decrease significantly the incen-tives toward safety of the party in the best position to prevent injuries." Scindia Steam, supra, at 181 (concurringopinion); see also

Edmonds, supra, at 274 (Blackmun, J.,
dissenting). It is also worth noting that an injured longshoreman's acceptance of statutory compensation operates as
an assignment to the stevedore-employer of the longshoreman's right to bring suit against the vessel, so long as the
longshoreman does not sue within six months of accepting
compensation. 33 U. S. C. $ 933(b). Were we to have accepted the longshoreman's contentions in Scindia Steam, we
would have run the risk of promoting the kind of collateral
litigation between stevedores and vessels (albeit in a different guise) that had consumed an intolerable amount of litigation costs prior to the 1972 Amendments. See Gilmore &
Black $ 6-46, at 411.

The foregoing principles, while taken from Scindia
Steam's examination of the vessel's duty to intervene, bear
as well on the nature of the vessel's turnover duty, and hence
on the case before us. We consider first Howlett's view that
a vessel must make reasonable inspections during stevedoring operations to ensure a proper stow and to detect any
hazards or defects before they become hidden. The beneficiaries of this proposed duty would be longshoremen who
unload or otherwise deal with the cargo at later ports. But
if, as we held in Scindia Steam, a vessel need not supervise
or inspect ongoing cargo operations for the benefit of longshoremen then on board, it would make little sense to impose
the same obligation for the benefit of longshoremen at subse512us1$71L 12-24-97 08:23:29 PAGES OPINPGT

103Cite as: 512 U. S. 92 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
quent ports. In practical effect, then, adopting Howlett'sproposal would impose inconsistent standards upon shipowners as to different sets of longshoremen, and would rendermuch of our holding in

Scindia Steam an empty gesture.
These concerns are mitigated somewhat when a longshoreman, such as Howlett, works on cargo stowed in a foreignport and undisturbed by longshoremen in a prior American

port of call. Foreign longshoremen are not covered by theAct, so requiring vessels to supervise and inspect a foreign
stevedore's ongoing operations would not be inconsistentwith the precise rule laid down in

Scindia Steam. This consideration, however, does not support imposing broader duties upon vessels to inspect cargo loading operations in foreign ports. It is settled maritime custom and practice that
the stevedore exercises primary control over the details of a
cargo operation, see Oregon Stevedoring, supra, at 322-323,
and we are given no reason to believe that this is any less
true in foreign ports than in domestic ports.

That is not to say, of course, that the vessel and its crew
remain detached from cargo operations altogether. Most
vessels take responsibility, for instance, for preparing a
stowage plan, which governs where each cargo will be
stowed on the ship. See generally C. Sauerbier & R. Meurn,
Marine Cargo Operations 217-239 (2d ed. 1985). But it is
the stevedore, an independent contractor hired for its expertise in the stowage and handling of cargo, that is charged
with actual implementation of the plan. To impose a duty
upon vessels to exercise scrutiny over a cargo loading operation to discover defects that may become hidden when the
stow is complete would require vessels to inject themselves
into matters beyond their ordinary province. See Williams,
Shipowner Liability for Improperly Stowed Cargo: Federal
Courts at Sea on the Standard of Care Owed to Off-Loading
Longshoremen, 17 Tulane Mar. L. J. 185, 198-199 (1993); contra Turner v. Japan Lines, Ltd., 651 F. 2d, at 1304 (vessel

[and] supervising its work when necessary"). The proposedrule would undermine Congress' intent in $ 5(b) to eliminate

the vessel's nondelegable duty to protect longshoremen fromthe negligence of others. See

Scindia Steam, 451 U. S., at
168-169.

We next consider Howlett's view that a vessel must makereasonable inspections after the completion of stevedoring

operations to discover hazards in the stow. There is goodreason to doubt that adopting this rule would have much
practical import. Any hazard uncovered by a shipownerwho inspects a completed stow would, as a matter of course,
be discovered in a subsequent port by a stevedore "reasonably competent in the performance of his work." Id., at 167.
As discussed above, shipowners engage a stevedore for its
expertise in cargo operations and are entitled to assume that
a competent stevedore will be able to identify and cope with
defects in the stow. See id., at 171; Hugev v. Dampskisaktieselskabet Int'l, 170 F. Supp., at 609-610. Once loading
operations are complete, it follows that any dangers arising
from an improper stow would be "at least as apparent to the
[stevedore] as to the [shipowner]." Atlantic & Gulf Stevedores, Inc. v. Ellerman Lines, Ltd., 369 U. S., at 366 (Stewart, J., dissenting). Because there can be no recovery under

$ 5(b) for a vessel's failure to warn of dangers that would be
apparent to a longshoreman of reasonable competence, Scindia Steam, supra, at 167, nothing would be accomplished by
imposing a duty upon vessels to inspect the stow upon completion of cargo operations. That is reason enough to reject it.

For the purposes of delineating the scope of a shipowner's
turnover duty, then, the cargo stow is separate and distinct
from other aspects of the ship. When between ports, the
vessel and its crew have direct access to (and control over)
the ship itself and its gear, equipment, and tools. The vessel's responsibilities to inspect these areas of the ship are
commensurate with its access and control, bearing in mind,

105Cite as: 512 U. S. 92 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
of course, that negligence, rather than unseaworthiness, isthe controlling standard where longshoremen are concerned.

Because the vessel does not exercise the same degree of op-erational control over, and does not have the same access to,
the cargo stow, its duties with respect to the stow are limitedby comparison. See

Robertson v. Tokai Shosen K. K., 655F. Supp. 152, 154 (ED Pa.), aff 'd, 835 F. 2d 490 (CA3 1987),

cert. denied, 486 U. S. 1007 (1988).In sum, the vessel's turnover duty to warn of latent defects
in the cargo stow and cargo area is a narrow one. The dutyattaches only to latent hazards, defined as hazards that are
not known to the stevedore and that would be neither obvi-ous to nor anticipated by a skilled stevedore in the competent
performance of its work. Scindia Steam, 451 U. S., at 167.Furthermore, the duty encompasses only those hazards that
"are known to the vessel or should be known to it in theexercise of reasonable care."

Ibid. Contrary to Howlett'ssubmission, however, the exercise of reasonable care does

not require the shipowner to supervise the ongoing opera-tions of the loading stevedore (or other stevedores who handle the cargo before its arrival in port) or to inspect thecompleted stow.

III
We turn to the proper disposition of this case. As theCourt of Appeals did not issue an opinion, we have before us

only the District Court's statement of its reasons for grant-ing summary judgment in favor of Birkdale. The vessel
having been under no obligation to supervise and inspect thecargo loading operations, and no other theory for charging
the vessel with constructive knowledge having been ad-vanced, the District Court was correct to inquire whether
the vessel had actual knowledge of the tween deck's condi-tion. The District Court found it undisputed that there was
no actual knowledge. At this stage of the proceedings, how-ever, we cannot conclude that summary judgment can rest
on this ground. There is sufficient evidence in the record

512us1$71L 12-24-97 08:23:29 PAGES OPINPGT
106 HOWLETT v. BIRKDALE SHIPPING CO.

Opinion of the Court
to support a permissible inference that, during the loadingprocess, some crew members, who might have held positions

such that their knowledge should be attributed to the vessel,did in fact observe the plastic on the tween deck. And the
District Court's alternative theory that even if some crewmembers were aware of the condition during loading operations, then the condition also would have been open and obvi-ous to a stevedore during unloading operations, may prove
faulty as well, being premised on the state of affairs whenthe vessel took on cargo, not during discharge at the port
where Howlett was injured.All this does not mean that the vessel is not entitled to
summary judgment. Howlett's own witnesses stated thatthe plastic was visible, even from the top deck, during unloading operations. Howlett must overcome these submis-sions, for even assuming the vessel had knowledge of the
tween deck's condition, he must further demonstrate that thealleged hazard would have been neither obvious to nor anticipated by a skilled and competent stevedore at the dischargeport. This contention, however, was not addressed by the
District Court and was not explored in detail here. Wethink it the better course to remand the case to the Court of
Appeals so that it, or the District Court, can address in thefirst instance these and other relevant points upon a review
of the entire record made in support of the vessel's motionfor summary judgment.

For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appealsis vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

LIVADAS v. BRADSHAW, CALIFORNIA LABORCOMMISSIONER
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 92-1920. Argued April 26, 1994--Decided June 13, 1994
California law requires employers to pay all wages due immediately upon

an employee's discharge, Labor Code $ 201; imposes a penalty for refusal
to pay promptly, $ 203; and places responsibility for enforcing these provisions on the Commissioner of Labor. After petitioner Livadas's employer refused to pay her the wages owed upon her discharge, but paid
them a few days later, she filed a penalty claim. The Commissioner
replied with a form letter construing Labor Code $ 229 as barring him
from enforcing such claims on behalf of individuals like Livadas, whose
employment terms and conditions are governed by a collectivebargaining agreement containing an arbitration clause. Livadas
brought this action under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, alleging that the nonenforcement policy was pre-empted by federal law because it abridged
her rights under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The District Court granted her summary judgment, rejecting the Commissioner's defense that the claim was pre-empted by $ 301 of the LaborManagement Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA). Although acknowledging
that the NLRA gives Livadas a right to bargain collectively and that

$ 1983 would supply a remedy for official deprivation of that right, the
Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that no federal right had been
infringed because Livadas's case reduced to an assertion that the Commissioner had misinterpreted state law, namely $ 229.

Held:

1. The Commissioner's policy is pre-empted by federal law.
Pp. 116-132.

(a) This case is fundamentally no different from Nash v. Florida
Industrial Comm'n, 389 U. S. 235, 239, in which the Court held that a
state rule predicating benefits on refraining from conduct protected by
federal labor law was pre-empted because it interfered with congressional purpose. The Commissioner's policy, which requires Livadas to
choose between Labor Code and NLRA rights, cannot be reconciled
with a federal statutory scheme premised on the centrality of collective
bargaining and the desirability of arbitration. Pp. 116-118.

(b) The Commissioner's answers to the foregoing conclusion flow
from two significant misunderstandings of law. First, the assertion
that the nonenforcement policy must be valid because $ 229 is consistent

512us1$72Z 12-24-97 08:32:41 PAGES OPINPGT
108 LIVADAS v. BRADSHAW

Syllabus
with federal law is premised on irrelevant relationships and leads to the
wrong question: Pre-emption analysis turns on the policy's actual content and its real effect on federal rights, not on whether $ 229 is valid
under the Federal Constitution or whether the policy is, as a matter of
state law, a proper interpretation of $ 229. Second, the argument that
a "rational basis" supports the distinction the policy draws between employees represented by unions and those who are not mistakes a validity
standard under the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses for what
the Supremacy Clause requires: a determination whether the state rule
conflicts with the federal law. Pp. 118-121.

(c) This Court's decisions according pre-emptive effect to LMRA

$ 301 foreclose even a colorable argument that a claim under Labor Code

$ 203 was pre-empted here, since they establish that the section does
not broadly pre-empt nonnegotiable employee rights conferred by state
law; that it is a claim's legal character, as independent of rights under
the collective-bargaining agreement, that decides whether a state cause
of action may go forward; and that when liability is governed by independent state law and the meaning of contract terms is not in dispute,
the bare fact that a collective-bargaining agreement is consulted for
damage computation is no reason to extinguish the state-law claim.
See, e. g., Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U. S. 202, and Lingle v.
Norge Div. of Magic Chef, Inc., 486 U. S. 399. Here, the primary text
for deciding whether Livadas was entitled to a penalty was not the
collective-bargaining agreement, but a calendar. The only issue raised
by her claim, whether her employer willfully failed to pay her wages
promptly upon severance, was a question of state law entirely independent of the agreement. Absent any indication that there was a dispute
over the penalty amount, the simple need to refer to bargained-for wage
rates in computing the penalty is irrelevant. Pp. 121-125.

(d) The Commissioner's attempt before this Court to recast the
nonenforcement policy as expressing a "conscious decision" to keep the
State's "hands off" the claims of employees protected by collectivebargaining agreements, either because the Commissioner's efforts and
resources are more urgently needed by others or because official restraint will actually encourage the collective-bargaining and arbitral
processes favored by federal law, is rejected. If the policy were in fact
animated by the first of these late-blooming rationales, the Commissioner's emphasis on the need to avoid "interpret[ing]" or "apply[ing]"
collective-bargaining agreements would be entirely misplaced. Nor is
the second asserted rationale convincing, since enforcement under the
policy does not turn on the bargain struck by the contracting parties or
on whether the contractual wage rate is even arbitrable, but simply on
the fact that the parties have consented to arbitration. The suggestion
that the policy is meant to stimulate freewheeling bargaining over

wage payments to discharged workers contradicts Labor Code $ 219,
which expressly and categorically prohibits the modification of rules
under the Code by "private agreement." Even at face value, however,
the "hands off" label poses special dangers that advantages conferred
by federal law will be canceled out and its objectives undermined, and
those dangers are not laid to rest by professions of the need for governmental neutrality in labor disputes. Similarly, the vague assertions
that the policy advances federal interests are not persuasive, since this
Court has never suggested that the federal bias toward bargaining is to
be served by forcing employees and employers to bargain for what they
would otherwise be entitled to under state law. Fort Halifax Packing
Co. v. Coyne, 482 U. S. 1, and the federal and state "opt-out" laws cited
by the Commissioner, distinguished. Pp. 126-132.

2. Livadas is entitled to seek relief under $ 1983 for the Commissioner's abridgment of her NLRA right to complete the collectivebargaining process and agree to an arbitration clause. That right is at
least immanent in the NLRA's structure, if it is not provided in so many
words by the statutory text, and the obligation to respect it on the part
of those acting under color of law is not vague or amorphous. Moreover, Congress has given no indication of any intent to foreclose actions
like Livadas's, and there is no cause for special caution here. See
Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493 U. S. 103, 108-112.

110 LIVADAS v. BRADSHAW

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
California law requires employers to pay all wages dueimmediately upon an employee's discharge, imposes a penalty for refusal to pay promptly, precludes any private con-tractual waiver of these minimum labor standards, and
places responsibility for enforcing these provisions on theState Commissioner of Labor (Commissioner or Labor Commissioner), ostensibly for the benefit of all employees. Re-spondent, the Labor Commissioner,

1 has construed a further

provision of state law as barring enforcement of these wage
and penalty claims on behalf of individuals like petitioner,
whose terms and conditions of employment are governed bya collective-bargaining agreement containing an arbitration

clause. We hold that federal law pre-empts this policy, asabridging the exercise of such employees' rights under the
National Labor Relations Act (NLRA or Act), 29 U. S. C.$ 151

et seq., and that redress for this unlawful refusal to
enforce may be had under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983.

I
Until her discharge on January 2, 1990, petitioner Karen
Livadas worked as a grocery clerk in a Vallejo, California,Safeway supermarket. The terms and conditions of her employment were subject to a collective-bargaining agreement
between Safeway and Livadas's union, Local 373 of theUnited Food and Commercial Workers, AFL-CIO. Unexceptionally, the agreement provided that "[d]isputes as to theinterpretation or application of the agreement," including
grievances arising from allegedly unjust discharge or sus-pension, would be subject to binding arbitration. See Food

Quentin Riegel; and for the Employers Group et al. by Steven G. Drapkin.

defendant in this action, as Labor Commissioner and has been substituted

Local 373, AFL-CIO, Solano and Napa Counties $$ 18.2, 18.3
(Mar. 1, 1989-Feb. 29, 1992) (Food Store Contract).2 When
notified of her discharge, Livadas demanded immediate payment of wages owed her, as guaranteed to all California
workers by state law, see Cal. Lab. Code Ann. $ 201 (West
1989),3 but her store manager refused, referring to the company practice of making such payments by check mailed from
a central corporate payroll office. On January 5, 1990, Livadas received a check from Safeway, in the full amount owed
for her work through January 2.

On January 9, 1990, Livadas filed a claim against Safeway
with the California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE or Division), asserting that under $ 203 of the
Labor Code the company was liable to her for a sum equal
to three days' wages, as a penalty for the delay between
discharge and the date when payment was in fact re2 Section 18.1 of the collective-bargaining agreement defines a "grievance" as a "dispute . . . involving or arising out of the meaning, interpretation, application or alleged violation" of the agreement.

Section 18.8 provides that "[i]n the case of a direct wage claim . . .
which does not involve an interpretation of any of the provisions of this
Agreement, either party may submit such claim for settlement to either
the grievance procedure provided for herein or to any other tribunal or
agency which is authorized and empowered to effect such a settlement."

3 California Labor Code $ 201 provides in pertinent part: "If an employer

discharges an employee, the wages earned and unpaid at the time of discharge are due and payable immediately." It draws no distinction between union-represented employees and others.

Under another provision of California law, Labor Code $ 219, the protections of $ 201 (and of other rules governing the frequency and form of
wage payments) "can [not] in any way be contravened or set aside by
private agreement, whether written, oral, or implied," although employers
are free to pay wages more frequently, in greater amounts, or at an earlier
date than ordained by these state rules; cf. $ 204.2 (executive, administrative, and professional employees may negotiate through collective bargaining for pay periods different from those required by state law).

112 LIVADAS v. BRADSHAW

Opinion of the Court
ceived.4 Livadas requested the Commissioner to enforcethe claim.

5

By an apparently standard form letter dated February 7,1990, the Division notified Livadas that it would take no

action on her complaint:

"It is our understanding that the employees work-ing for Safeway are covered by a collective bargaining

agreement which contains an arbitration clause. Theprovisions of Labor Code Section 229 preclude this Division from adjudicating any dispute concerning the inter-pretation or application of any collective bargaining
agreement containing an arbitration clause."Labor Code Section 203 requires that the wages continue at the `same rate' until paid. In order to establishwhat the `same rate' was, it is necessary to look to the

4 That section provides that when an employer "willfully fails" to comply
with the strictures of $ 201 and fails to pay "any wages" owed discharged
employees, "the wages of such employees shall continue as a penalty from
the due date thereof at the same rate until paid or until an action therefor
is commenced; but such wages shall not continue for more than 30 days."
Cal. Lab. Code Ann. $ 203 (West 1989).

In her DLSE claim form, Livadas made plain that she did not dispute
Safeway's calculation of the wages owed, but sought only the penalty for
the employer's late tender. App. 18.

5 Under state law, the Commissioner of Labor is the Division Chief of

the DLSE, see Cal. Lab. Code Ann. $$ 79, 82(b) (West 1989), and is authorized either directly to prosecute a wage or penalty claim on an employee's
behalf in state court, $ 98.3(a), or, in the alternative, to initiate informal
hearings under DLSE auspices, see $ 98(a), in which full relief may be
awarded, $ 98.1. The Commissioner's policy with respect to claims by employees covered by collective-bargaining agreements appears not to distinguish between these two modes of proceeding, and, accordingly, we will
refer, as the parties largely do, to her policy as a categorical refusal to
"enforce" such claims. Although Labor Code $ 218 states that "[n]othing
in this article shall limit the right of any wage claimant to sue . . . for any
wages or penalty due him," another provision, $ 218.5, authorizes attorney's fee awards to prevailing parties in wage and penalty disputes, making individual litigation a somewhat risky prospect, and DLSE enforcement remains in any event the more realistic avenue for modest claims.

6 App. 16.

The letter made no reference to any particular aspect ofLivadas's claim making it unfit for enforcement, and the
Commissioner's position is fairly taken to be that DLSE en-forcement of $ 203 claims, as well as other claims for which
relief is pegged to an employee's wage rate, is generallyunavailable to employees covered by collective-bargaining
agreements.7Livadas brought this action in the United States District
Court under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, alleging thatthe nonenforcement policy, reflecting the Commissioner's
reading of Labor Code $ 229, was pre-empted as conflictingwith Livadas's rights under $ 7 of the NLRA, 49 Stat. 452,
as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 157, because the policy placed a

6 Labor Code $ 229 provides: "Actions to enforce the provisions of this
article [Labor Code $$ 200-243] for the collection of due and unpaid wages
claimed by an individual may be maintained without regard to the existence of any private agreement to arbitrate. This section shall not apply
to claims involving any dispute concerning the interpretation or application of any collective bargaining agreement containing such an arbitration agreement." Cf. Perry v. Thomas, 482 U. S. 483 (1987) ($ 229 bar to
waiver defeated by Federal Arbitration Act policy).

All concerned identify the allusion to what "courts" have said to be a
reference to a 1975 decision of the California Court of Appeal, Plumbing,
Heating and Piping Employers Council v. Howard, 53 Cal. App. 3d 828,
126 Cal. Rptr. 406, where the Commissioner was held barred by the statute from enforcing an "unpaid" wage claim arising from an employee's
assertion that he was entitled, under collective-bargaining agreements
then in force, to receive a foreman's rate of pay and not a journeyman's.

7 The Commissioner notes that a small minority of collective-bargaining

agreements lack provisions either setting wage rates or mandating arbitration (and therefore might potentially be enforced under the challenged
policy). But see n. 13, infra; Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic Chef, Inc.,
486 U. S. 399, 411, n. 11 (1988) (noting that 99% of sampled collectivebargaining agreements include arbitration clauses).

penalty on the exercise of her statutory right to bargain col-lectively with her employer. She stressed that there was

no dispute about the amount owed and that neither she norSafeway had begun any grievance proceeding over the penalty.8 Livadas sought a declaration that the Commissioner'sinterpretation of $ 229 was pre-empted, an injunction against
adherence to the allegedly impermissible policy, and an order
requiring the Commissioner either to process her penaltyclaim or (if it would be time barred under state law) pay

her damages in the amount the Commissioner would haveobtained if the Commissioner had moved against the employer in time.The District Court granted summary judgment for Livadas, holding the labor pre-emption claim cognizable under$ 1983, see

Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493
U. S. 103 (1989) (Golden State II), and the Commissioner's
policy pre-empted as interfering with her $ 7 right, see, e. g.,
Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 475 U. S. 608
(1986) (Golden State I), by denying her the benefit of a minimum labor standard, namely, the right to timely payment of
final wages secured by Labor Code $$ 201 and 203. 749
F. Supp. 1526 (ND Cal. 1990). The District Court treated
as irrelevant the Commissioner's assertion that the policy
was consistent with state law (e. g., Labor Code $ 229) and
rejected the defense that it was required by federal law,
namely, $ 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 1947
(LMRA), 61 Stat. 156, 29 U. S. C. $ 185(a), which has been
read to pre-empt state-court resolution of disputes turning
on the rights of parties under collective-bargaining agree8 Livadas did file a grievance claiming that the discharge had been improper under the collective-bargaining agreement, ultimately obtaining
reinstatement with backpay. While the parties dispute what effect, as a
matter of state law, that recovery would have on Livadas's right under

$ 203, neither the pertinent California statutes nor the Commissioner's
policy at issue here depend on whether a claimant's termination was for
just cause.

ments. The District Court explained that resolution of theclaim under $ 203 "requires reference only to a calendar, not

to the [collective-bargaining agreement]," 749 F. Supp.,at 1536, and granted petitioner all requested relief. Id., at
1540.9A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. 987 F. 2d 552 (1993). The court acknowl-edged that federal law gives Livadas a right to engage in
collective bargaining and that $ 1983 would supply a remedyfor official deprivation of that right, but the panel majority
concluded that no federal right had been infringed. Thecourt reasoned that the policy was based on the Commissioner's reading of Labor Code $ 229, whose function of keepingstate tribunals from adjudicating claims in a way that would
interfere with the operation of federal labor policy is, bydefinition, consistent with the dictates of federal law. Noting that Livadas did not assert pre-emption of $ 229 itself orobject to the California courts' interpretation of it, the majority concluded that her case reduced to an assertion thatthe Commissioner had misinterpreted state law, an error for
which relief could be obtained in California courts.Livadas could not claim to be "penalized," the Appeals
panel then observed, for she stood "in the same position asevery other employee in the state when it comes to seeking
the Commissioner's enforcement. Every employee . . . issubject to an eligibility determination, and every employee
. . . is subject to the risk that the Commissioner will getit wrong." 987 F. 2d, at 559. The Ninth Circuit majority
concluded by invoking the "general policies of federal laborlaw" strongly favoring the arbitration of disputes and reasoning that, "Congress would not want state officials erring

9 In the Court of Appeals, Livadas acknowledged that the portion of the
District Court's order awarding monetary relief against the Commissioner
in her official capacity was likely barred by the Eleventh Amendment, see
Brief for Petitioner 43, n. 20. This and other issues arising from the scope
of the remedy are better left for the courts below on remand.

A
A state rule predicating benefits on refraining from con-duct protected by federal labor law poses special dangers of

interference with congressional purpose. In Nash v. Florida Industrial Comm'n, 389 U. S. 235 (1967), a unanimousCourt held that a state policy of withholding unemployment

benefits solely because an employee had filed an unfair laborpractice charge with the National Labor Relations Board
had a "direct tendency to frustrate the purpose of Congress"and, if not pre-empted, would "defeat or handicap a valid
national objective by . . . withdraw[ing] state benefits . . .simply because" an employee engages in conduct protected

10 In dissent, Judge Kozinski countered that by focusing on whether Livadas was entitled to a correct application of state law, the majority had
explored the wrong question. The proper enquiry, the dissent maintained, was not whether the Commissioner has discretion under state law
not to enforce wage and penalty claims (which she plainly does) or whether
she need enforce claims if doing so would actually be pre-empted by
federal law (she plainly need not), but whether she may draw the line
for enforcement purposes between individuals covered by collectivebargaining agreements containing arbitration clauses (whose claims will
sometimes but not always be pre-empted under $ 301) and those not so
covered. Underscoring that Livadas's claim would not, in fact, have been
pre-empted had the federal rule been given its proper scope, the dissent
found wanting the majority's "quasi-pre-emption" rationale, 987 F. 2d, at
562. Judge Kozinski concluded that the Commissioner's policy, based on
an "honest (though flagrant) mistake of law," id., at 563, could not be
squared with the requirements of federal labor law, because the burdened
class was defined by the exercise of federal rights and because the burden
on collective-bargaining rights, justified only by a mistaken understanding
of what $ 301 requires, served no "legitimate state purpose" at all. Ibid.

11 Just as the respondent

arbitration clause. This unappetizing choice, we conclude,was not intended by Congress, see

infra, at 130, and cannotultimately be reconciled with a statutory scheme premised

on the centrality of the right to bargain collectively and thedesirability of resolving contract disputes through arbitra11 While the NLRA does not expressly recognize a right to be covered
by a collective-bargaining agreement, in that no duty is imposed on an
employer actually to reach agreement with represented employees, see 29
U. S. C. $ 158(d), a State's penalty on those who complete the collectivebargaining process works an interference with the operation of the Act,
much as does a penalty on those who participate in the process. Cf. Hill
v. Florida ex rel. Watson, 325 U. S. 538 (1945) (State may not enforce
licensing requirement on collective-bargaining agents).

We understand the difference between the position of petitioner (who
would place this case within our "Machinists" line of labor pre-emption
cases, see Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm'n, 427

U. S. 132 (1976)) and that of her amicus, the Solicitor General (who describes it as a case of "conflict" pre-emption, see Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 14-15, and n. 4) to be entirely semantic, depending on
whether Livadas's right is characterized as implicit in the structure of the
Act (as was the right to self-help upheld in Machinists) or as rooted in the
text of $ 7. See generally Golden State II, 493 U. S. 103, 110-112 (1989)
(emphasizing fundamental similarity between enumerated NLRA rights
and "Machinists" rights). Neither party here argues for application of
the rule of San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236
(1959), which safeguards the primary jurisdiction of the National Labor
Relations Board to pass judgment on certain conduct, such as labor picketing, which might be held protected by $ 7 of the Act but which might also
be prohibited by $ 8 of the Act.

The Commissioner's answers to this pre-emption conclu-sion flow from two significant misunderstandings of law.

First, the Commissioner conflates the policy that Livadaschallenges with the state law on which it purports to rest,
Labor Code $ 229, assuming that if the statutory provisionis consistent with federal law, her policy must be also. But

12 Despite certain similarities, the question whether federal labor law
permits a State to grant or withhold unemployment insurance benefits
from striking workers requires consideration of the policies underlying a
distinct federal statute, Title IX of the Social Security Act, see 26 U. S. C.

$ 3301 (1988 ed. and Supp. IV); 42 U. S. C. $ 501 et seq.; 42 U. S. C. $ 1101
et seq. Thus, straightforward NLRA pre-emption analysis has been held
inappropriate. See New York Telephone Co. v. New York State Dept. of
Labor, 440 U. S. 519, 536-540 (1979) (plurality opinion); see also id., at 549
(Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment).

Noting that Nash v. Florida Industrial Comm'n, 389 U. S. 235 (1967),
held state action pre-empted that was "like the coercive actions which
employers and unions are forbidden to engage in," see id., at 239, it is
argued here, see Brief for Employers Group as Amicus Curiae 7-12, that
the NLRA prohibits only state action closely analogous to conduct that
would support an unfair labor practice charge if engaged in by a private
employer. Our cases, however, teach that parallelism is not dispositive
and that the Act sometimes demands a more scrupulous evenhandedness
from the States. See generally Wisconsin Dept. of Industry v. Gould,
Inc., 475 U. S. 282, 290 (1986) (State may not debar employers with multiple NLRA violations from government contracting); compare Golden
State I, 475 U. S. 608 (1986), with NLRB v. Servette, Inc., 377 U. S. 46,
49-54 (1964) (private actor may refuse to deal with employer based on
impending strike); but cf. Building & Constr. Trades Council v. Associated Builders & Contractors of Mass. /R. I., Inc., 507 U. S. 218, 227-

228 (1993) (the Act does not always preclude a State, functioning as an
employer or a purchaser of labor services, from behaving as a private
employer would be entitled to do).

Opinion of the Court
on this logic, a policy of issuing general search warrants
would be justified if it were adopted to implement a state
statute codifying word-for-word the "good-faith" exception
to the valid warrant requirement recognized in United
States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897 (1984). The relationship between policy and state statute and between the statute and
federal law is, in any event, irrelevant. The question presented by this case is not whether Labor Code $ 229 is valid
under the Federal Constitution or whether the Commissioner's policy is, as a matter of state law, a proper interpretation of $ 229. Pre-emption analysis, rather, turns on the actual content of respondent's policy and its real effect on federal rights. See Nash v. Florida Industrial Comm'n, 389
U. S. 235 (1967) (holding pre-empted an administrative policy
interpreting presumably valid state unemployment insurance law exception for "labor disputes" to include proceedings under NLRB complaints); see also 987 F. 2d, at 561
(Kozinski, J., dissenting).13

Having sought to lead us to the wrong question, the Commissioner proposes the wrong approach for answering it, defending the distinction drawn in the challenged statutory interpretation, between employees represented by unions and
those who are not, as supported by a "rational basis," see,

13 See also Rum Creek Coal Sales, Inc. v. Caperton, 971 F. 2d 1148,
1154 (CA4 1992) (State may not, consistently with the NLRA, withhold
protections of state antitrespass law from employer involved in labor dispute, in an effort to apply a facially valid "neutrality statute"). Thus,
while the "misinterpretation of a perfectly valid state statute . . . does not
[in itself] provide grounds for federal relief," 987 F. 2d, at 559, it does not
follow that no federal relief may be had when such misinterpretation results in conflict with federal law. Nor does the opportunity to seek redress in a nonfederal forum determine the existence of a federal right, see
ibid. See, e. g., Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 183 (1961). Of course, the
extent to which a course of conduct has deviated from "clearly established"
federal law remains crucial to deciding whether an official will be entitled
to immunity from individual damage liability, see, e. g., Davis v. Scherer,
468 U. S. 183, 197 (1984).

e. g., Brief for Respondent 17. But such reasoning mistakesa standard for validity under the Equal Protection and Due

Process Clauses for what the Supremacy Clause requires.The power to tax is no less the power to destroy,

McCulloch
v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), merely because a state
legislature has an undoubtedly rational and "legitimate" in-terest in raising revenue. In labor pre-emption cases, as in

others under the Supremacy Clause, our office is not to passjudgment on the reasonableness of state policy, see,

e. g.,
Golden State I, 475 U. S. 608 (1986) (city's desire to remain"neutral" in labor dispute does not determine pre-emption).

It is instead to decide if a state rule conflicts with or other-wise "stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives" of the federal law.

That is not to say, of course, that the several rationales for
the policy urged on the Court by the Commissioner and
amici are beside the point here. If, most obviously, the
Commissioner's policy were actually compelled by federal
law, as she argues it is, we could hardly say that it was,
simultaneously, pre-empted; at the least, our task would then
be one of harmonizing statutory law. But we entertain this
and other justifications claimed, not because constitutional
analysis under the Supremacy Clause is an open-ended balancing act, simply weighing the federal interest against the
intensity of local feeling, see id., at 503, but because claims of
justification can sometimes help us to discern congressional
purpose, the "ultimate touchstone" of our enquiry. Malone

14 Similarly, because our analysis here turns not on the "rationality" of
the governmental classification, but rather on its effect on federal objectives, the Commissioner's policy is not saved merely because it happens,
at the margins, to be "under-" and "over-inclusive," i. e., burdening certain
employees who are not protected by the NLRA and allowing employees
covered by highly unusual collective-bargaining agreements the benefit of
enforcement of $$ 201 and 203 claims.

We begin with the most complete of the defenses mountedby the Commissioner, one that seems (or seemed until recently, at least) to be at the heart of her position: that thechallenged policy, far from being pre-empted by federal law,
is positively compelled by it, and that even if the Commis-sioner had been so inclined, the LMRA $ 301 would have precluded enforcement of Livadas's penalty claim. The non-enforcement policy, she suggests, is a necessary emanation
from this Court's $ 301 pre-emption jurisprudence, markedas it has been by repeated admonitions that courts should
steer clear of collective-bargaining disputes between par-ties who have provided for arbitration. See, e. g., AllisChalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U. S. 202 (1985). Because, thisargument runs (and Livadas was told in the DLSE no-action
letter), disposition of a union-represented employee's pen-alty claim entails the "interpretation or application" of
a collective-bargaining agreement (since determining theamount owed turns on the contractual rate of pay agreed)
resort to a state tribunal would lead it into territory thatCongress, in enacting $ 301, meant to be covered exclusively
by arbitrators.This reasoning, however, mistakes both the functions $ 301
serves in our national labor law and our prior decisions ac-cording that provision pre-emptive effect. To be sure, we
have read the text of $ 301 15 not only to grant federal courtsjurisdiction over claims asserting breach of collective15 Section 301 states that "[s]uits for violation of contracts between an

bargaining agreements but also to authorize the develop-ment of federal common-law rules of decision, in large part

to assure that agreements to arbitrate grievances would beenforced, regardless of the vagaries of state law and lingering hostility toward extrajudicial dispute resolution, see Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U. S. 448, 455-456(1957); see also

Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., 363
U. S. 574 (1960); Avco Corp. v. Machinists, 390 U. S. 557, 559(1968) ("$ 301 . . . was fashioned by Congress to place sanctions behind agreements to arbitrate grievance disputes").And in

Teamsters v. Lucas Flour Co., 369 U. S. 95 (1962), we
recognized an important corollary to the Lincoln Mills rule:while $ 301 does not preclude state courts from taking jurisdiction over cases arising from disputes over the interpretation of collective-bargaining agreements, state contract lawmust yield to the developing federal common law, lest common terms in bargaining agreements be given different and
potentially inconsistent interpretations in different jurisdictions. See 369 U. S., at 103-104.16

And while this sensible "acorn" of $ 301 pre-emption recognized in Lucas Flour has sprouted modestly in more recent
decisions of this Court, see, e. g., Lueck, supra, at 210 ("[I]f
the policies that animate $ 301 are to be given their proper
range . . . the pre-emptive effect of $ 301 must extend beyond
suits alleging contract violations"), it has not yet become,
nor may it, a sufficiently "mighty oak," see Golden State I,
475 U. S., at 622 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), to supply the
cover the Commissioner seeks here. To the contrary, the
pre-emption rule has been applied only to assure that the

16 Within its proper sphere, $ 301 has been accorded unusual pre-emptive
power. In Avco Corp. v. Machinists, 390 U. S. 557 (1968), for example, we
recognized that an action for breach of a collective-bargaining agreement
"ar[ose] under" $ 301 (and therefore was subject to federal removal, see 28
U. S. C. $ 1441 (1988 ed. and Supp. IV)), despite the fact that the petitioner's complaint did not mention the federal provision and appeared to plead
an adequate claim for relief under state contract law.

purposes animating $ 301 will be frustrated neither by state
laws purporting to determine "questions relating to what the
parties to a labor agreement agreed, and what legal consequences were intended to flow from breaches of that agreement," Lueck, 471 U. S., at 211, nor by parties' efforts to
renege on their arbitration promises by "relabeling" as tort
suits actions simply alleging breaches of duties assumed in
collective-bargaining agreements, id., at 219; see Republic
Steel Corp. v. Maddox, 379 U. S. 650, 652 (1965) ("[F]ederal
labor policy requires that individual employees wishing to
assert contract grievances must attempt use of the contract
grievance procedure agreed upon by employer and union as
the mode of redress") (emphasis deleted).

In Lueck and in Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic Chef, Inc.,
486 U. S. 399 (1988), we underscored the point that $ 301 cannot be read broadly to pre-empt nonnegotiable rights conferred on individual employees as a matter of state law,17
and we stressed that it is the legal character of a claim, as
"independent" of rights under the collective-bargaining
agreement, Lueck, supra, at 213 (and not whether a grievance arising from "precisely the same set of facts" could be
pursued, Lingle, supra, at 410) that decides whether a state

17 That is so, we explained, both because Congress is understood to have
legislated against a backdrop of generally applicable labor standards, see,
e. g., Lingle, 486 U. S., at 411-412, and because the scope of the arbitral
promise is not itself unlimited, see Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav.
Co., 363 U. S. 574, 582 (1960) ("[A]rbitration is a matter of contract and a
party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he
has not agreed so to submit"). And while contract-interpretation disputes must be resolved in the bargained-for arbitral realm, see Republic
Steel Corp. v. Maddox, 379 U. S. 650 (1965), $ 301 does not disable state
courts from interpreting the terms of collective-bargaining agreements in
resolving non-pre-empted claims, see Charles Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney,
368 U. S. 502 (1962) (state courts have jurisdiction over $ 301 suits but
must apply federal common law); NLRB v. C & C Plywood Corp., 385 U. S.

cause of action may go forward.18 Finally, we were clearthat when the meaning of contract terms is not the subject

of dispute, the bare fact that a collective-bargaining agree-ment will be consulted in the course of state-law litigation
plainly does not require the claim to be extinguished, see
Lingle, supra, at 413, n. 12 ("A collective-bargaining agree-ment may, of course, contain information such as rate of pay

. . . that might be helpful in determining the damages towhich a worker prevailing in a state-law suit is entitled").

These principles foreclose even a colorable argument thata claim under Labor Code $ 203 was pre-empted here. As
the District Court aptly observed, the primary text for de-ciding whether Livadas was entitled to a penalty was not the
Food Store Contract, but a calendar. The only issue raisedby Livadas's claim, whether Safeway "willfully fail[ed] to
pay" her wages promptly upon severance, Cal. Lab. Code

18 We are aware, as an amicus brief makes clear, see Brief for AFL-CIO
as Amicus Curiae, that the Courts of Appeals have not been entirely
uniform in their understanding and application of the principles set down
in Lingle and Lueck. But this case, in which non-pre-emption under $ 301
is clear beyond peradventure, see infra this page and 125, is not a fit
occasion for us to resolve disagreements that have arisen over the proper
scope of our earlier decisions. We do note in this regard that while our
cases tend to speak broadly in terms of $ 301 "pre-emption," defendants
invoke that provision in diverse situations and for different reasons: sometimes their assertion is that a plaintiff's cause of action itself derives from
the collective-bargaining agreement (and, by that agreement, belongs before an arbitrator); in other instances, the argument is different, that a
plaintiff's claim cannot be "resolved" absent collective-bargaining agreement interpretation, i. e., that a term of the agreement may or does confer
a defense on the employer (perhaps because the employee or his union has
negotiated away the state-law right), cf. Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482
U. S. 386, 398-399 (1987); and in other cases still, concededly "independent" state-law litigation may nonetheless entail some collective-bargaining
agreement application. Holding the plaintiff's cause of action substantively extinguished may not, as amicus AFL-CIO observes, always be the
only means of vindicating the arbitrator's primacy as the bargained-for
contract interpreter. Cf. Collyer Insulated Wire, Gulf & Western Systems Co., 192 N. L. R. B. 837 (1971).

Ann. $ 203 (West 1989), was a question of state law, en-tirely independent of any understanding embodied in the

collective-bargaining agreement between the union and theemployer. There is no indication that there was a "dispute"
in this case over the amount of the penalty to which Livadaswould be entitled, and

Lingle makes plain in so many wordsthat when liability is governed by independent state law, the

mere need to "look to" the collective-bargaining agreementfor damages computation is no reason to hold the state-law
claim defeated by $ 301. See 486 U. S., at 413, n. 12.19Beyond the simple need to refer to bargained-for wage
rates in computing the penalty, the collective-bargainingagreement is irrelevant to the dispute (if any) between Livadas and Safeway. There is no suggestion here that Liva-das's union sought or purported to bargain away her protections under $ 201 or $ 203, a waiver that we have said would(especially in view of Labor Code $ 219) have to be " `clear
and unmistakable,' " see Lingle, supra, at 409-410, n. 9 (quot-ing

Metropolitan Edison Co. v. NLRB, 460 U. S. 693, 708(1983)), for a court even to consider whether it could be given

effect, nor is there any indication that the parties to thecollective-bargaining agreement understood their arbitration
pledge to cover these state-law claims. See generally Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 35 (1991);cf. Food Store Contract $ 18.8. But even if such suggestions

or indications were to be found, the Commissioner could notinvoke them to defend her policy, which makes no effort to
take such factors into account before denying enforcement.20

19 This is not to say, of course, that a $ 203 penalty claim could never be
pre-empted by $ 301.

20 In holding the challenged policy pre-empted, we note that there is no

equally obvious conflict between what $ 301 requires and the text of Labor
Code $ 229 (as against what respondent has read it to mean). The California provision, which concerns whether a promise to arbitrate a claim will
be enforced to defeat a direct action under the Labor Code, does not purport generally to deny union-represented employees their rights under

Before this Court, however, the Commissioner does notconfine herself to the assertion that Livadas's claim would

have been pre-empted by LMRA $ 301. Indeed, largely put-ting aside that position, she has sought here to cast the policy in different terms, as expressing a "conscious decision,"see Brief for Respondent 14, to keep the State's "hands off "
the claims of employees protected by collective-bargainingagreements, either because the Division's efforts and resources are more urgently needed by others or becauseofficial restraint will actually encourage the collectivebargaining and arbitral processes favored by federal law.The latter, more ambitious defense has been vigorously
taken up by the Commissioner's amici, who warn that invali-dation of the disputed policy would sound the death knell
for other, more common governmental measures that takeaccount of collective-bargaining processes or treat workers
represented by unions differently from others in any respect.Although there surely is no bar to our considering these
alternative explanations, cf. Dandridge v. Williams, 397U. S. 471, 475, n. 6 (1970) (party may defend judgment on
basis not relied upon below), we note, as is often the casewith such late-blooming rationales, that the overlap between
what the Commissioner now claims to be state policy andwhat the state legislature has enacted into law is awkwardly
inexact. First, if the Commissioner's policy (or California

concerning the interpretation or application of any collective-bargaining
agreement," in which event an "agreement to arbitrate" such disputes is
to be given effect. Nor does the Howard decision, the apparent font of
the Commissioner's policy, appear untrue to $ 301 teachings: there, an employee sought to have an "unpaid wage" claim do the office of a claim that
a collective-bargaining agreement entitled him to a higher wage; that sort
of claim, however, derives its existence from the collective-bargaining
agreement and, accordingly, falls within any customary understanding of
arbitral jurisdiction. See 53 Cal. App. 3d, at 836, 126 Cal. Rptr., at 411.

law) were animated simply by the frugal desire to conserve
the State's money for the protection of employees not covered by collective-bargaining agreements, the Commissioner's emphasis, in the letter to Livadas and in this litigation,
on the need to "interpret" or "apply" terms of a collectivebargaining agreement would be entirely misplaced.

Nor is the nonenforcement policy convincingly defended
as giving parties to a collective-bargaining agreement the
"benefit of their bargain," see Brief for Respondent 18, n. 13,
by assuring them that their promise to arbitrate is kept and
not circumvented. Under the Commissioner's policy, enforcement does not turn on what disputes the parties agreed
would be resolved by arbitration (the bargain struck), see
Gilmer, 500 U. S., at 26, or on whether the contractual wage
rate is even subject to (arbitrable) dispute. Rather, enforcement turns exclusively on the fact that the contracting parties consented to any arbitration at all. Even if the Commissioner could permissibly presume that state-law claims
are generally intended to be arbitrated, but cf. id., at 35 (employees in prior cases "had not agreed to arbitrate their statutory claims, and the labor arbitrators were not authorized
to resolve such claims"),21 her policy goes still further. Even
in cases when it could be said with "positive assurance,"

21 In holding that an agreement to arbitrate an Age Discrimination in
Employment Act claim is enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act,
Gilmer emphasized its basic consistency with our unanimous decision in
Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36 (1974), permitting a discharged employee to bring a Title VII claim, notwithstanding his having
already grieved the dismissal under a collective-bargaining agreement.
Gilmer distinguished Gardner-Denver as relying, inter alia, on: the "distinctly separate nature of . . . contractual and statutory rights" (even when
both were "violated as a result of the same factual occurrence"), 415 U. S.,
at 50; the fact that a labor "arbitrator has authority to resolve only questions of contractual rights," id., at 53-54; and the concern that in
collective-bargaining arbitration, "the interests of the individual employee
may be subordinated to the collective interests of all employees in the
bargaining unit," id., at 58, n. 19.

Opinion of the Court
Warrior & Gulf, 363 U. S., at 582, that the parties did notintend that state-law claims be subject to arbitration, cf.

Food Store Contract $ 18.8 (direct wage claim not involvinginterpretation of agreement may be submitted "to any other
tribunal or agency which is authorized and empowered" toenforce it), the Commissioner would still deny enforcement,
on the stated basis that the collective-bargaining agreementnonetheless contained "an arbitration clause" and because
the claim would, on her view, entail "interpretation," of theagreement's terms. Such an irrebuttable presumption is not
easily described as the benefit of the parties' "bargain."The Commissioner and

amici finally suggest that denyingenforcement to union-represented employees' claims under

$$ 201 and 203 (and other Labor Code provisions) is meantto encourage parties to bargain collectively for their own
rules about the payment of wages to discharged workers.But with this suggestion, the State's position simply slips
any tether to California law. If California's goal really wereto stimulate such freewheeling bargaining on these subjects,
the enactment of Labor Code $ 219, expressly and categori-cally prohibiting the modification of these Labor Code rules
by "private agreement," would be a very odd way to pursueit.

22 Cf. Cal. Lab. Code Ann. $ 227.3 (West 1989) (allowing

parties to collective-bargaining agreement to arrive at differ-ent rule for vacation pay). In short, the policy, the rationales, and the state law are not coherent.

2
Even at face value, however, neither the "hands off " labelsnor the vague assertions that general labor law policies are

thereby advanced much support the Commissioner's defensehere. The former merely takes the position discussed and
rejected earlier, that a distinction between claimants repre-sented by unions and those who are not is "rational," the

former being less "in need" than the latter. While we
hardly suggest here that every distinction between unionrepresented employees and others is invalid under the
NLRA, see infra, at 131-132, the assertion that represented
employees are less "in need" precisely because they have
exercised federal rights poses special dangers that advantages conferred by federal law will be canceled out and its
objectives undermined. Cf. Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at
756 ("It would turn the policy that animated the Wagner Act
on its head to understand it to have penalized workers who
have chosen to join a union by preventing them from benefiting from state labor regulations imposing minimal standards
on nonunion employers"). Accordingly, as we observed in
Metropolitan Life, the widespread practice in Congress and
in state legislatures has assumed the contrary, bestowing
basic employment guarantees and protections on individual

Nor do professions of "neutrality" lay the dangers to rest.
The pre-empted action in Golden State I could easily have
been redescribed as following a "hands-off " policy, in that
the city sought to avoid endorsing either side in the course
of a labor dispute, see 475 U. S., at 622 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (city did not seek "to place its weight on one side or
the other of the scales of economic warfare"), and the respondent commission in Nash may have understood its policy
as expressing neutrality between the parties in a yet-to-be23 We noted that "Congress [has never] seen fit to exclude unionized
workers and employers from laws establishing federal minimum employment standards. We see no reason to believe that for this purpose
Congress intended state minimum labor standards to be treated differently . . . . Minimum state labor standards affect union and nonunion
employees equally and neither encourage nor discourage the collectivebargaining processes that are the subject of the NLRA." Metropolitan

(NLRA forbids state policy, under state law barring "aid orassistance" to either party to a labor dispute, of not arresting
picketers who violated state trespass laws). Nor need wepause long over the assertion that nonenforcement of valid
state-law claims is consistent with federal labor law by"encouraging" the operation of collective bargaining and
arbitration process. Denying represented employees basicsafety protections might "encourage" collective bargaining
over that subject, and denying union employers the protection of generally applicable state trespass law might lead to
increased bargaining over the rights of labor pickets, cf.
Rum Creek, supra, but we have never suggested that labor
law's bias toward bargaining is to be served by forcing em-ployees or employers to bargain for what they would otherwise be entitled to as a matter of course. See generally
Metropolitan Life, supra, at 757 (Congress did not intend to
"remove the backdrop of state law . . . and thereby artificiallycreate a no-law area") (emphasis deleted and internal quotation marks omitted).24The precedent cited by the Commissioner and

amici
as supporting the broadest "hands off " view, Fort Halifax
Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U. S. 1 (1987), is not in point. In
that case we held that there was no federal pre-emption of aMaine statute that allowed employees and employers to contract for plant-closing severance payments different fromthose otherwise mandated by state law. That decision, however, does not even purport to address the question supposedly presented here: while there was mention of state lati24 Were it enough simply to point to a general labor policy advanced by

Opinion of the Court
tude to "balance the desirability of a particular substantivelabor standard against the right of self-determination regarding the terms and conditions of employment," see id., at22, the policy challenged here differs in two crucial respects
from the "unexceptional exercise of the [State's] policepower,"

ibid. (internal quotation marks and citation omit-ted), defended in those terms in our earlier case. Most fundamentally, the Maine law treated all employees equally,whether or not represented by a labor organization. All
were entitled to the statutory severance payment, and allwere allowed to negotiate agreements providing for different benefits. See id., at 4, n. 1. Second, the minimumprotections of Maine's plant-closing law were relinquished
not by the mere act of signing an employment contract(or collective-bargaining agreement), but only by the parties'
express agreement on different terms, see id., at 21.25While the Commissioner and her amici call our attention
to a number of state and federal laws that draw distinctionsbetween union and nonunion represented employees, see,
e. g., D. C. Code Ann. $ 36-103 (1993) ("Unless otherwisespecified in a collective agreement . . . [w]henever an employer discharges an employee, the employer shall pay theemployee's wages earned not later than the working day
following such discharge"); 29 U. S. C. $ 203(o) ("Hours[w]orked" for Fair Labor Standards Act measured according
to "express terms of . . . or practice under bona fidecollective-bargaining agreement"), virtually all share the
important second feature observed in Coyne, that union-represented employees have the full protection of the
minimum standard, absent any agreement for somethingdifferent. These "opt out" statutes are thus manifestly different in their operation (and their effect on federal rights)

25 It bears mention that the law in Fort Halifax pegged the benefit payment to an employee's wages, meaning that the State Labor Commissioner
would "look to" the collective-bargaining agreement in enforcing claims in
precisely the same manner that respondent would here.

Opinion of the Court
from the Commissioner's rule that an employee forfeits hisstate-law rights the moment a collective-bargaining agreement with an arbitration clause is entered into. But cf. Met-ropolitan Edison, 460 U. S., at 708. Hence, our holding that
the Commissioner's unusual policy is irreconcilable with thestructure and purposes of the Act should cast no shadow on
the validity of these familiar and narrowly drawn opt-outprovisions.

26

III
Having determined that the Commissioner's policy is infact pre-empted by federal law, we find strong support in our

precedents for the position taken by both courts below thatLivadas is entitled to seek relief under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 for
the Commissioner's abridgment of her NLRA rights. Sec-tion 1983 provides a federal cause of action for the deprivation, under color of law, of a citizen's "rights, privileges, orimmunities secured by the Constitution and laws" of the
United States, and we have given that provision the effectits terms require, as affording redress for violations of federal statutes, as well as of constitutional norms. Maine v.
Thiboutot, 448 U. S. 1, 4 (1980). We have, it is true, recog-nized that even the broad statutory text does not authorize a

suit for every alleged violation of federal law. A particularstatutory provision, for example, may be so manifestly precatory that it could not fairly be read to impose a "bindingobligatio[n]" on a governmental unit,

Pennhurst State Schooland Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 27 (1981), or its

terms may be so "vague and amorphous" that determiningwhether a "deprivation" might have occurred would strain
judicial competence. See Wright v. Roanoke Redevelop26 Nor does it seem plausible to suggest that Congress meant to preempt such opt-out laws, as "burdening" the statutory right of employees
not to join unions by denying nonrepresented employees the "benefit" of
being able to "contract out" of such standards. Cf. Addendum B to Brief
for Employers Group as Amicus Curiae (collecting state statutes containing similar provisions).

ment and Housing Authority, 479 U. S. 418, 431-432 (1987).And Congress itself might make it clear that violation of a

statute will not give rise to liability under $ 1983, either byexpress words or by providing a comprehensive alternative
enforcement scheme. See Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U. S. 1 (1981).But apart from these exceptional cases, $ 1983 remains a

generally and presumptively available remedy for claimedviolations of federal law. See also

Dennis v. Higgins, 498
U. S. 439, 443 (1991).Our conclusion that Livadas is entitled to seek redress

under $ 1983 is, if not controlled outright, at least heavilyforeshadowed by our decision in

Golden State II. We began
there with the recognition that not every instance of federal
pre-emption gives rise to a $ 1983 cause of action, see 493U. S., at 108, and we explained that to decide the availability

of $ 1983 relief a court must look to the nature of the federal
law accorded pre-emptive effect and the character of the interest claimed under it, ibid.27 We had no difficulty concluding, however, as we had often before, see, e. g., Hill v. Florida ex rel. Watson, 325 U. S. 538 (1945), that the NLRA
protects interests of employees and employers against
abridgment by a State, as well as by private actors; that
the obligations it imposes on governmental actors are not so
"vague and amorphous" as to exceed judicial competence to
decide; and that Congress had not meant to foreclose relief
under $ 1983. In so concluding, we contrasted the intricate
scheme provided to remedy violations by private actors to
the complete absence of provision for relief from governmen27 Thus, Golden State II observed that an NLRA pre-emption claim
grounded in the need to vindicate the primary jurisdiction of the National
Labor Relations Board, see San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236 (1959), see n. 10, supra, is "fundamentally different"
from one stemming from state abridgment of a protected individual interest, see 493 U. S., at 110, a difference that might prove relevant to cognizability under $ 1983.

Opinion of the Court
tal interference, see 493 U. S., at 108-109. Indeed, the onlyissue seriously in dispute in Golden State II was whether

the freedom to resort to "peaceful methods of . . . economicpressure," id., at 112 (internal quotation marks omitted),
which we had recognized as implicit in the structure of theAct, could support $ 1983 liability in the same manner as official abridgment of those rights enumerated in the textwould do.

Ibid. The Court majority said yes, explainingthat "[a] rule of law that is the product of judicial interpretation of a vague, ambiguous, or incomplete statutory provisionis no less binding than a rule that is based on the plain meaning of a statute." Ibid.The right Livadas asserts, to complete the collectivebargaining process and agree to an arbitration clause, is, ifnot provided in so many words in the NLRA, see n. 10,
supra, at least as immanent in its structure as the right ofthe cab company in

Golden State II. And the obligation torespect it on the part of the Commissioner and others acting

under color of law is no more "vague and amorphous" thanthe obligation in

Golden State. Congress, of course, hasgiven no more indication of any intent to foreclose actions

like Livadas's than the sort brought by the cab company.Finding no cause for special caution here, we hold that Livadas's claim is properly brought under $ 1983.

IV
In an effort to give wide berth to federal labor lawand policy, the Commissioner declines to enforce unionrepresented employees' claims rooted in nonwaivable rightsostensibly secured by state law to all employees, without regard to whether the claims are valid under state law or pre-empted by LMRA $ 301. Federal labor law does not require
such a heavy-handed policy, and, indeed, cannot permit it.We do not suggest here that the NLRA automatically defeats all state action taking any account of the collective-bargaining process or every state law distinguishing union512us1$72M 12-24-97 08:32:41 PAGES OPINPGT

IBANEZ v. FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESSAND PROFESSIONAL REGULATION, BOARD OF

ACCOUNTANCY
certiorari to the district court of appeal offlorida, first district

No. 93-639. Argued April 19, 1994--Decided June 13, 1994
Petitioner Ibanez is a member of the Florida Bar; she is also a Certified

Public Accountant (CPA) licensed by respondent Florida Board of Accountancy (Board), and is authorized by the Certified Financial Planner
Board of Standards, a private organization, to use the designation "Certified Financial Planner" (CFP). She referred to these credentials in
her advertising and other communication with the public concerning her
law practice, placing CPA and CFP next to her name in her yellow
pages listing and on her business cards and law offices stationery. Notwithstanding the apparent truthfulness of the communication--it is undisputed that neither her CPA license nor her CFP authorization has
been revoked--the Board reprimanded her for engaging in "false, deceptive, and misleading" advertising. The District Court of Appeal of
Florida, First District, affirmed.

Held: The Board's decision censuring Ibanez is incompatible with First

Amendment restraints on official action. Pp. 142-149.

(a) Ibanez' use of the CPA and CFP designations qualifies as "commercial speech." The State may ban such speech only if it is false,
deceptive, or misleading. See, e. g., Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary
Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U. S. 626, 638. If it is not, the
State can restrict it, but only upon a showing that the restriction directly and materially advances a substantial state interest in a manner
no more extensive than necessary to serve that interest. See, e. g., Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447
U. S. 557, 564, 566. The State's burden is not slight: It must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restrictions will in
fact alleviate them to a material degree. See, e. g., Edenfield v. Fane,
507 U. S. 761, 771. Measured against these standards, the order reprimanding Ibanez cannot stand. Pp. 142-143.

(b) The Board asserts that Ibanez' use of the CPA designation on her
commercial communications is misleading in that it tells the public she
is subject to the Florida Accountancy Act and to the Board's jurisdiction
"when she believes and acts as though she is not." This position is
insubstantial. Ibanez no longer contests the Board's assertion of juris512us1$73Z 01-08-98 12:20:42 PAGES OPINPGT

137Cite as: 512 U. S. 136 (1994)
Syllabus
diction over her, and in any event, what she "believes" regarding the
reach of the Board's authority is not sanctionable. See Baird v. State
Bar of Ariz., 401 U. S. 1, 6. Nor can the Board rest on the bare assertion that Ibanez is unwilling to comply with its regulation; it must
build its case on specific evidence of noncompliance. It has never even
charged Ibanez with an action out of compliance with the governing
statutory or regulatory standards. And as long as she holds a currently active CPA license from the Board, it is difficult to see how consumers could be misled by her truthful representation to that effect.
Pp. 143-144.

(c) The Board's justifications for disciplining Ibanez based on her use
of the CFP designation are not more persuasive. The Board presents
no evidence that Ibanez' use of the term "certified" "inherently mislead[s]" by causing the public to infer state approval and recognition.
See Peel v. Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Comm'n of Ill., 496
U. S. 91 (attorney's use of designation "Certified Civil Trial Specialist By
the National Board of Trial Advocacy" neither actually nor inherently
misleading). Nor did the Board advert to key aspects of the designation here at issue--the nature of the authorizing organization and the
state of knowledge of the public to whom Ibanez' communications are
directed--in reaching its alternative conclusion that the CFP designation is "potentially misleading." On the bare record made in this case,
the Board has not shown that the restrictions burden no more of Ibanez'
constitutionally protected speech than necessary. Pp. 144-149.

Opinion of the Court

Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
Petitioner Silvia Safille Ibanez, a member of the Florida
Bar since 1983, practices law in Winter Haven, Florida. Sheis also a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), licensed by respondent Florida Board of Accountancy (Board) 1 to "practicepublic accounting." In addition, she is authorized by the
Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, a privateorganization, to use the trademarked designation "Certified
Financial Planner" (CFP).

Ibanez referred to these credentials in her advertising andother communication with the public. She placed CPA and

CFP next to her name in her yellow pages listing (under"Attorneys") and on her business card. She also used those
designations at the left side of her "Law Offices" stationery.Notwithstanding the apparently truthful nature of her communication--it is undisputed that neither her CPA licensenor her CFP certification has been revoked--the Board reprimanded her for engaging in "false, deceptive, and misleading" advertising. Final Order of the Board of Accountancy

demonstrated with sufficient specificity that any member ofthe public could have been misled by Ibanez' constitutionally

protected speech or that any harm could have resulted fromallowing that speech to reach the public's eyes. We therefore hold that the Board's decision censuring Ibanez is incom-patible with First Amendment restraints on official action.

The Board learned of Ibanez' use of the designations CPAand CFP when a copy of Ibanez' yellow pages listing was

mailed, anonymously, to the Board's offices; it thereuponcommenced an investigation and, subsequently, issued a
complaint against her. The Board charged Ibanez with (1)

CPA's. For example, a partnership or corporation cannot "practice public

At the ensuing disciplinary hearing, Ibanez argued thatshe was practicing law, not "public accounting," and was
therefore not subject to the Board's regulatory jurisdiction.Response to Amended Administrative Complaint (filed Aug.
26, 1991), || 25, id., at 108.6 Her use of the CPA and CFPdesignations, she argued further, constituted "nonmisleading, truthful, commercial speech" for which she could notbe sanctioned. || 24, ibid. Prior to the close of proceedings
before the hearing officer, the Board dropped the charge thatIbanez was practicing public accounting in an unlicensed
firm. Order on Reconsideration (filed Aug. 22, 1991), || 2, id.,at 103-104. The hearing officer subsequently found in Ibanez' favor on all counts, and recommended to the Board that,

4 Florida Stat. $ 473.3101 (Supp. 1994) requires that "[e]ach partnership,
corporation, or limited liability company seeking to engage in the practice
of public accounting" apply for a license from the Board, and $ 473.309
requires that each such partnership or corporation hold a current license.

5 Rule 24.001(1) states, in pertinent part, that "[n]o licensee shall disseminate . . . any . . . advertising which is in any way fraudulent, false, deceptive, or misleading, if it . . . (g) [s]tates or implies that the licensee has
received formal recognition as a specialist in any aspect of the practice of
public accountancy unless . . . [the] recognizing agency is approved by the
Board." Fla. Admin. Code $ 61H1-24.001(1) (1994). The CFP Board of
Standards, the "recognizing agency" in regard to Ibanez' CFP designation,
has not been approved by the Board.

6 Ibanez pointed out that she does not perform the "attest" function in

her law practice, and that no service she performs requires a CPA license.

for want of the requisite proof, all charges against Ibanezbe dismissed. Recommended Order (filed Jan. 15, 1992),

App. 147.The Board rejected the hearing officer's recommendation,
and declared Ibanez guilty of "false, deceptive and misleading" advertising. Final Order, id., at 194. The Board rea-soned, first, that Ibanez was "practicing public accounting"

by virtue of her use of the CPA designation and was thussubject to the Board's disciplinary jurisdiction.

Id., at 183.
Because Ibanez had insisted that her law practice was out-side the Board's regulatory jurisdiction, she had, in the

Board's judgment, rendered her use of the CPA designationmisleading:

"[Ibanez] advertises the fact that she is a CPA, whileperforming the same `accounting' activities she performed when she worked for licensed CPA firms, butshe does not concede that she is engaged in the practice
of public accounting so as to bring herself within the
jurisdiction of the Board of Accountancy for any negli-gence or errors [of which] she may be guilty when delivering her services to her clients."[Ibanez] is unwilling to acquiesce in the requirements
of [the Public Accountancy Act] and [the Board's rules]by complying with those requirements. She does not
license her firm as a CPA firm; forego certain forms ofremuneration denied to individuals who are practicing
public accountancy; or limit the ownership of her firm to
other CPAs. . . . [She] has, in effect, told the public thatshe is subject to the provisions of [the Public Accountancy Act] and the jurisdiction of the Board of Accountancy when she believes and acts as though she is not."
Id., at 184-185.

Next, the Board addressed Ibanez' use of the CFP designation. On that matter, the Board stated that any designation using the term "certified" to refer to a certifying orga512us1$73P 01-08-98 12:20:42 PAGES OPINPGT

nization other than the Board itself (or an organizationapproved by the Board) "inherently mislead[s] the public into

believing that state approval and recognition exists." Id.,at 193-194. Ibanez appealed to the District Court of Appeal, First District, which affirmed the Board's final order
per curiam without opinion. Id., at 196, judgt. order re-ported at 621 So. 2d 435 (1993). As a result, Ibanez had no

right of review in the Florida Supreme Court. We grantedcertiorari, 510 U. S. 1067 (1994), and now reverse.

A
The Board correctly acknowledged that Ibanez' use ofthe CPA and CFP designations was "commercial speech."

Final Order, App. 186. Because "disclosure of truthful, rel-evant information is more likely to make a positive contribution to decisionmaking than is concealment of such infor-mation," Peel v. Attorney Registration and Disciplinary
Comm'n of Ill., 496 U. S. 91, 108 (1990), only false, deceptive,or misleading commercial speech may be banned.

harmless from the harmful." Zauderer, 471 U. S., at 646."[M]ere speculation or conjecture" will not suffice; rather the
State "must demonstrate that the harms it recites are realand that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree." Edenfield, 507 U. S., at 770, 771; see also
Zauderer, 471 U. S., at 648-649 (State's "unsupported asser-tions" insufficient to justify prohibition on attorney advertising; "broad prophylactic rules may not be so lightly justifiedif the protections afforded commercial speech are to retain

We turn first to Ibanez' use of the CPA designation in hercommercial communications. On that matter, the Board's

position is entirely insubstantial. To reiterate, Ibanez holdsa currently active CPA license which the Board has never
sought to revoke. The Board asserts that her truthful com-munication is nonetheless misleading because it "[tells] the
public that she is subject to the provisions of [the Accoun-tancy Act] and the jurisdiction of the Board of Accountancy
when she believes and acts as though she is not." FinalOrder, App. 185; see also Brief for Respondent 20 ("[T]he use

of the CPA designation . . . where the licensee is unwillingto comply with the provisions of the [statute] under which

the license was granted, is inherently misleading and maybe prohibited.").

Ibanez no longer contests the Board's assertion of jurisdic-tion, see Brief for Petitioner 28 (Ibanez "is, in fact, a licensee
subject to the rules of the Board"), and in any event, whatshe "believes" regarding the reach of the Board's authority
is not sanctionable. See Baird v. State Bar of Ariz., 401U. S. 1, 6 (1971) (First Amendment "prohibits a State from
excluding a person from a profession or punishing him solelybecause . . . he holds certain beliefs"). Nor can the Board
rest on a bare assertion that Ibanez is "unwilling to comply"with its regulation. To survive constitutional review, the
Board must build its case on specific evidence of noncompli-ance. Ibanez has neither been charged with, nor found
guilty of, any professional activity or practice out of compli-ance with the governing statutory or regulatory standards.

8

And as long as Ibanez holds an active CPA license from theBoard we cannot imagine how consumers can be misled by

her truthful representation to that effect.

C
The Board's justifications for disciplining Ibanez for usingthe CFP designation are scarcely more persuasive. The

Board concluded that the words used in the designation--particularly, the word "certified"--so closely resemble "the
terms protected by state licensure itself, that their use, whennot approved by the Board, inherently mislead[s] the public
into believing that state approval and recognition exists."Final Order, App. 193-194. This conclusion is difficult to
maintain in light of Peel. We held in Peel that an attorney'suse of the designation "Certified Civil Trial Specialist By the

this kind, viz., the allegation that she practiced public accounting in an
unlicensed firm. See supra, at 140.

National Board of Trial Advocacy" was neither actually norinherently misleading. See 496 U. S., at 106 (rejecting contention that use of National Board of Trial Advocacy certifi-cation on attorney's letterhead was "actually misleading");
id., at 110 ("State may not . . . completely ban statementsthat are not actually or inherently misleading, such as certification as a specialist by bona fide organizations such asNBTA");

id., at 111 (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, J., con-curring in judgment) (agreeing that attorney's letterhead

was "neither actually nor inherently misleading"). TheBoard offers nothing to support a different conclusion with
respect to the CFP designation.9 Given "the complete ab-sence of any evidence of deception," id., at 106, the Board's
"concern about the possibility of deception in hypotheticalcases is not sufficient to rebut the constitutional presumption
favoring disclosure over concealment," id., at 111.10

9 Justice O'Connor writes that "[t]he average consumer has no way to
verify the accuracy or value of [Ibanez'] use of the CFP designation" because her advertising, "[u]nlike the advertisement in Peel, . . . did not
identify the organization that had conferred the certification." Post, at
150. We do not agree that the consumer of financial planning services is
thus disarmed.

To verify Ibanez' CFP credential, a consumer could call the CFP Board
of Standards. The Board that reprimanded Ibanez never suggested that
such a call would be significantly more difficult to make than one to the
certifying organization in Peel, the National Board of Trial Advocacy. We
note in this regard that the attorney's letterhead in Peel supplied no address or telephone number for the certifying agency. Most instructive on
this matter, we think, is the requirement of the Rules of Professional Conduct of the Florida Bar, to which attorney Ibanez is subject, that she
provide "written information setting forth the factual details of [her] experience, expertise, background, and training" to anyone who so inquires.
See Florida Bar, Rule of Professional Conduct 4-7.3(a)(2).

10 The Board called only three witnesses at the proceeding against Ibanez, all of whom were employees or former employees of the Department
of Professional Regulation. Neither the witnesses, nor the Board in its
submissions to this Court, offered evidence that any member of the public
has been misled by the use of the CFP designation. See Peel, 496 U. S.,
at 100-101 (noting that there was "no contention that any potential client

Opinion of the Court

The Board alternatively contends that Ibanez' use of the
CFP designation is "potentially misleading," entitling the
Board to "enact measures short of a total ban to prevent
deception or confusion." Brief for Respondent 33, citing
Peel, 496 U. S., at 116 (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, J.,
concurring in judgment). If the "protections afforded commercial speech are to retain their force," Zauderer, 471 U. S.,
at 648-649, we cannot allow rote invocation of the words "potentially misleading" to supplant the Board's burden to
"demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its
restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree."
Edenfield, 507 U. S., at 771.

The Board points to Rule 24.001(1)( j), Fla. Admin. Code

$ 61H1-24.001(1)( j) (1994), which prohibits use of any "specialist" designation unless accompanied by a disclaimer,
made "in the immediate proximity of the statement that implies formal recognition as a specialist"; the disclaimer must
"stat[e] that the recognizing agency is not affiliated with or
sanctioned by the state or federal government," and it must
set out the recognizing agency's "requirements for recognition, including, but not limited to, educatio[n], experience[,]
and testing." See Brief for Respondent 33-35. Given the
state of this record--the failure of the Board to point to any
harm that is potentially real, not purely hypothetical--we
are satisfied that the Board's action is unjustified. We express no opinion whether, in other situations or on a different
record, the Board's insistence on a disclaimer might serve as
an appropriately tailored check against deception or confusion, rather than one imposing "unduly burdensome disclosure requirements [that] offend the First Amendment."
Zauderer, 471 U. S., at 651. This much is plain, however:
The detail required in the disclaimer currently described by
the Board effectively rules out notation of the "specialist"

or person was actually misled or deceived," nor "any factual finding of
actual deception or misunderstanding").

pages listing.11

The concurring Justices, on whom the Board relies, did
indeed find the "[NBTA] Certified Civil Trial Specialist"
statement on a lawyer's letterhead "potentially misleading,"
but they stated no categorical rule applicable to all specialty
designations. Thus, they recognized that "[t]he potential for
misunderstanding might be less if the NBTA were a commonly recognized organization and the public had a general
understanding of its requirements." Peel, 496 U. S., at 115.
In this regard, we stress again the failure of the Board to
back up its alleged concern that the designation CFP would
mislead rather than inform.

The Board never adverted to the prospect that the public
potentially in need of a civil trial specialist, see Peel, supra,
is wider, and perhaps less sophisticated, than the public with
financial resources warranting the services of a planner.
Noteworthy in this connection, "Certified Financial Planner"
and "CFP" are well-established, protected federal trademarks that have been described as "the most recognized
designation[s] in the planning field." Financial Planners:

Standards, Inc., et al. as Amici Curiae 3. Over 50 accred-ited universities and colleges have established courses of
study in financial planning approved by the CFP Board of
Standards, and standards for licensure include satisfactionof certain core educational requirements, a passing score on

a certification examination "similar in concept to the Bar orCPA examinations," completion of a planning-related work
experience requirement, agreement to abide by the CFPCode of Ethics and Professional Responsibility, and an annual continuing education requirement. Id., at 10-15.

Ibanez, it bears emphasis, is engaged in the practice of
law and so represents her offices to the public. Indeed, she
performs work reserved for lawyers but nothing that only
CPA's may do. See supra, at 139, n. 3. It is therefore significant that her use of the designation CFP is considered in
all respects appropriate by the Florida Bar. See Brief for
Florida Bar as Amicus Curiae 9-10 (noting that Florida Bar,
Rules of Professional Conduct, and particularly Rule 4-7.3,
"specifically allo[w] Ibanez to disclose her CPA and CFP credentials [and] contemplate that Ibanez must provide this
information to prospective clients (if relevant)").

Beyond question, this case does not fall within the caveat
noted in Peel covering certifications issued by organizations
that "had made no inquiry into petitioner's fitness," or had
"issued certificates indiscriminately for a price"; statements
made in such certifications, "even if true, could be misleading." 496 U. S., at 102. We have never sustained restrictions on constitutionally protected speech based on a record
so bare as the one on which the Board relies here. See
Edenfield, 507 U. S., at 771 (striking down Florida ban on

648-649 (striking down restrictions on attorney advertising

be to risk toleration of commercial speech restraints "in the

Accordingly, the judgment of the Florida District Court of
Appeal is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings
not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justice
joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.

Once again, we are confronted with a First Amendment
challenge to a state restriction on professional advertising.
Petitioner, who has been licensed as an attorney and as a
certified public accountant (CPA) by the State of Florida,
and who also has been recognized as a "Certified Financial
Planner" (CFP) by a private organization, identified herself in telephone listings under the "attorneys" heading as
"IBANEZ SILVIA S CPA CFP." App. 4. Respondent, the
Florida Board of Accountancy, determined that petitioner's
use of both the CPA and the CFP designations was inherently misleading, and sanctioned her for false advertising.
Fla. Stat. $ 473.323(1)(f ) (1991) (accountants subject to disciplinary action if they "[a]dvertis[e] goods or services in a
manner which is fraudulent, false, deceptive, or misleading
in form or content").

I

Because petitioner's use of the CFP designation is both
inherently and potentially misleading, I would uphold the
Board's sanction of petitioner. I therefore respectfully dissent from Parts II-A and II-C of the opinion of the Court.

150 IBANEZ v. FLORIDA DEPT. OF BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL REGULATION, BD. OF ACCOUNTANCY

Opinion of O'Connor, J.

A
States may prohibit inherently misleading speech entirely.
In re R. M. J., 455 U. S. 191, 203 (1982). In Peel v. AttorneyRegistration and Disciplinary Comm'n of Ill., 496 U. S. 91

(1990), we considered an attorney advertisement that pro-claimed the lawyer to be a " `Certified Civil Trial Specialist
By the National Board of Trial Advocacy.' " See id., at 96.A majority of the Court concluded that this statement was
not inherently misleading, although the discussion of thisissue was joined by only four Justices. See

id., at 100-106(plurality opinion); id., at 111 (Marshall, J., concurring in

judgment). The plurality reasoned that the certificationwas a statement of verifiable fact; that the certification had
been conferred by a reputable organization that had appliedobjectively clear standards to determining the attorney's
qualifications; and that consumers would not confuse the at-torney's claim of certification as a specialist with formal
state recognition.Although the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc., appears to be a reputable organization that appliesobjectively clear standards before conferring the CFP designation on accountants, the other factors relied on by the Peelplurality are not present in this case. First, it was important in Peel that "[t]he facts stated on [the attorney's] letter-head are true and verifiable." Id., at 100 (emphasis added);
see also id., at 101 ("A lawyer's certification by [the recogniz-ing organization] is a verifiable fact, as are the predicate requirements for that certification"). Of course, petitioner'srecognition as a CFP can be verified--but only if the consumer knows where to call or write. Unlike the advertise-ment in

Peel, petitioner's advertisements did not identify theorganization that had conferred the certification. The average consumer has no way to verify the accuracy or value ofpetitioner's use of the CFP designation.

Related to this point is the fact that, in the absence of anidentified conferring organization, the consumer is likely to

151Cite as: 512 U. S. 136 (1994)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
conclude that the CFP designation is conferred by the State.The Peel plurality stressed that "it seems unlikely that [the

attorney's] statement about his certification as a `specialist'by an identified national organization necessarily would
be confused with formal state recognition." Id., at 104-105(emphasis added). Because here there is no such identification, the converse is true. It is common knowledge that"many States prescribe requirements for, and `certify' public
accountants as, `Certified Public Accountants.' " Id., at 113(Marshall, J., concurring in judgment). Petitioner has of
course been licensed as a CPA by the State of Florida. Buther use of the CFP designation in close connection with the
identification of herself as a CPA ("IBANEZ SILVIA S CPACFP") would lead a reasonable consumer to conclude that
the two "certifications" were conferred by the same entity--the State of Florida.

The Board of Accountancy has recognized this likelihoodof consumer confusion: "[The term `certified'] in conjunction
with the term `CPA' and the practice of public accounting,[is] so close to the terms protected by state licensure itself,
that [its] use, when not approved by the Board, inherentlymislead[s] the public into believing that state approval and
recognition exists." App. 193-194. For this reason, theBoard's regulations provide that an advertisement will be
deemed misleading if it "[s]tates a form of recognition by anyentity other than the Board that uses the ter[m] `certified.' "
Fla. Admin. Code 61H1-24.001(1)(i) (1994). Petitioner's ad-vertising is in clear violation of this prohibition. Because
the First Amendment does not prevent a State from protect-ing consumers from such inherently misleading advertising,
in my view the Board's blanket prohibition on the use ofthe term "certified" in CPA advertising is constitutional as
applied to petitioner. B

But even if petitioner's use of "certified" was not inher-ently misleading, it seems clear beyond cavil that some con512us1$73J 01-08-98 12:20:42 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of O'Connor, J.

sumers would conclude that the State conferred the CFPdesignation, just as it does the CPA license, and thus that

the advertisement is potentially misleading. Indeed, thisconclusion follows

a fortiori from Peel, where five Justices
concluded that the attorney's specialty designation was at
least potentially misleading. See 496 U. S., at 118 (White,J., dissenting). The advertisement in

Peel, which identified
the certifying organization, provided substantially more in-formation to consumers than does petitioner's advertisement; if the one was potentially misleading (and we said thatit was), so too is the other.

States may not completely ban potentially misleading commercial speech if narrower limitations can ensure that the
information is presented in a nonmisleading manner. In re
R. M. J., supra, at 203. But if a professional's certification
claim has the potential to mislead, the State may "requir[e]
a disclaimer about the certifying organization or the standards of a specialty." Peel, 496 U. S., at 110 (plurality opinion); see also id., at 116-117 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment); In re R. M. J., supra, at 203. The Board has done
just that: An advertisement that "[s]tates or implies that the
licensee has received formal recognition as a specialist in any
aspect of the practice of public accounting" will be deemed
false or misleading, "unless the statement contains a disclaimer stating that the recognizing agency is not affiliated
with or sanctioned by the state or federal government."
Fla. Admin. Code 61H1-24.001(1)( j) (1994). "The advertisement must also contain the agency's requirements for recognition, including, but not limited to, educatio[n], experience
and testing. These statements must be in the immediate
proximity of the statement that implies formal recognition
as a specialist." Ibid. There is no question but that the
CFP designation "implies that [petitioner] has received
formal recognition as a specialist" in financial planning, an
"aspect of the practice of public accounting," and her advertisements do not contain the required disclaimer. If the ab512us1$73J 01-08-98 12:20:42 PAGES OPINPGT

153Cite as: 512 U. S. 136 (1994)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
solute prohibition on the use of the term "certified" cannotbe applied to petitioner (as the Court today holds), then the

disclaimer requirement applies to petitioner's advertisingthat she is a specialist in financial planning. Because petitioner failed to comply with it, the Board properly disci-plined her.

II
Petitioner is a certified public accountant, and her use ofthe CPA designation in advertising conveyed this truthful

information to the public. I agree with the Court that theState of Florida may not prohibit petitioner's use of the CPA
designation under the circumstances in which this case ispresented to us, and I therefore join Part II-B of the Court's
opinion. I would only point out that it is open to the Boardto proceed against petitioner for practicing public accounting
in violation of statutory or regulatory standards applicableto Florida accountants. See Brief for Petitioner 28 ("Petitioner is, in fact, a licensee subject to the rules of the Boardof Accountancy"). And if petitioner's public accounting license is revoked, the State may constitutionally prohibit herfrom advertising herself as a CPA.

SIMMONS v. SOUTH CAROLINA
certiorari to the supreme court of south carolina

No. 92-9059. Argued January 18, 1994--Decided June 17, 1994
During the penalty phase of petitioner's South Carolina trial, the State

argued that his future dangerousness was a factor for the jury to consider when deciding whether to sentence him to death or life imprisonment for the murder of an elderly woman. In rebuttal, petitioner presented evidence that his future dangerousness was limited to elderly
women and thus there was no reason to expect violent acts from him
in prison. However, the court refused to give the jury his proposed
instruction that under state law he was ineligible for parole. When
asked by the jury whether life imprisonment carried with it the possibility of parole, the court instructed the jury not to consider parole in
reaching its verdict and that the terms life imprisonment and death
sentence were to be understood to have their plain and ordinary meaning. The jury returned a death sentence. On appeal, the State Supreme Court concluded that regardless of whether a trial court's refusal
to inform a sentencing jury about a defendant's parole ineligibility might
ever be error, the instruction given to petitioner's jury satisfied in substance his request for a charge on such ineligibility.

Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
310 S. C. 439, 427 S. E. 2d 175, reversed and remanded.

Justice Blackmun, joined by Justice Stevens, Justice Souter,
and Justice Ginsburg, concluded:

1. Where a defendant's future dangerousness is at issue, and state
law prohibits his release on parole, due process requires that the sentencing jury be informed that the defendant is parole ineligible. An
individual cannot be executed on the basis of information which he had
no opportunity to deny or explain. Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349,
362. Petitioner's jury reasonably may have believed that he could be
released on parole if he were not executed. To the extent that this
misunderstanding pervaded its deliberations, it had the effect of creating a false choice between sentencing him to death and sentencing him
to a limited period of incarceration. The trial court's refusal to apprise
the jury of information so crucial to its determination, particularly when
the State alluded to the defendant's future dangerousness in its argument, cannot be reconciled with this Court's well-established precedents
interpreting the Due Process Clause. See, e. g., Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1. Pp. 161-169.

2. The trial court's instruction that life imprisonment was to be understood in its plain and ordinary meaning did not satisfy petitioner's
request for a parole ineligibility charge, since it did nothing to dispel
the misunderstanding reasonable jurors may have about the way in
which any particular State defines "life imprisonment." Pp. 169-171.

Justice O'Connor, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy, concluded that where the State puts a defendant's future dangerousness in issue, and the only available alternative sentence to death
is life imprisonment without possibility of parole, due process entitles
the defendant to inform the sentencing jury--either by argument or
instruction--that he is parole ineligible. If the prosecution does not
argue future dangerousness, a State may appropriately decide that
parole is not a proper issue for the jury's consideration even if the only
alternative sentence to death is life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Here, the trial court's instruction did not satisfy petitioner's request for a parole ineligibility charge, since the rejection of
parole is a recent development displacing the longstanding practice
of parole availability, and since common sense dictates that many jurors
might not know whether a life sentence carries with it the possibility
of parole. Pp. 175-178.

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
Justice Blackmun announced the judgment of the Courtand delivered an opinion, in which

Justice Stevens,
Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join.

This case presents the question whether the Due ProcessClause of the Fourteenth Amendment was violated by the

refusal of a state trial court to instruct the jury in thepenalty phase of a capital trial that under state law the defendant was ineligible for parole. We hold that where thedefendant's future dangerousness is at issue, and state law
prohibits the defendant's release on parole, due process re-quires that the sentencing jury be informed that the defendant is parole ineligible. I

A
In July 1990, petitioner beat to death an elderly woman,Josie Lamb, in her home in Columbia, South Carolina. The

week before petitioner's capital murder trial was scheduledto begin, he pleaded guilty to first-degree burglary and two
counts of criminal sexual conduct in connection with twoprior assaults on elderly women. Petitioner's guilty pleas
resulted in convictions for violent offenses, and those con-victions rendered petitioner ineligible for parole if convicted
of any subsequent violent-crime offense. S. C. Code Ann.$ 24-21-640 (Supp. 1993).

Prior to jury selection, the prosecution advised the trialjudge that the State "[o]bviously [was] going to ask you
to exclude any mention of parole throughout this trial."App. 2. Over defense counsel's objection, the trial court
granted the prosecution's motion for an order barring the

defense from asking any question during voir dire regardingparole. Under the court's order, defense counsel was forbidden even to mention the subject of parole, and expresslywas prohibited from questioning prospective jurors as to
whether they understood the meaning of a "life" sentenceunder South Carolina law.

1 After a 3-day trial, petitioner

was convicted of the murder of Ms. Lamb.During the penalty phase, the defense brought forward

mitigating evidence tending to show that petitioner's violentbehavior reflected serious mental disorders that stemmed
from years of neglect and extreme sexual and physical abusepetitioner endured as an adolescent. While there was some
disagreement among witnesses regarding the extent towhich petitioner's mental condition properly could be
deemed a "disorder," witnesses for both the defense and theprosecution agreed that petitioner posed a continuing danger
to elderly women.In its closing argument the prosecution argued that petitioner's future dangerousness was a factor for the jury toconsider when fixing the appropriate punishment. The
question for the jury, said the prosecution, was "what to dowith [petitioner] now that he is in our midst."

Id., at 110.The prosecution further urged that a verdict for death would

be "a response of society to someone who is a threat. Yourverdict will be an act of self-defense." Ibid.

Petitioner sought to rebut the prosecution's generalizedargument of future dangerousness by presenting evidence
that, due to his unique psychological problems, his danger-ousness was limited to elderly women, and that there was no
reason to expect further acts of violence once he was isolatedin a prison setting. In support of his argument, petitioner
introduced testimony from a female medical assistant and

1 The venire was informed, however, of the meaning of the term "death"
under South Carolina law. The trial judge specifically advised the prospective jurors that "[b]y the death penalty, we mean death by electrocution." The sentencing jury was also so informed. App. 129.

from two supervising officers at the Richland County jailwhere petitioner had been held prior to trial. All three testified that petitioner had adapted well to prison life duringhis pretrial confinement and had not behaved in a violent
manner toward any of the other inmates or staff. Petitioner
also offered expert opinion testimony from Richard L. Boyle,a clinical social worker and former correctional employee,

who had reviewed and observed petitioner's institutionaladjustment. Mr. Boyle expressed the view that, based on
petitioner's background and his current functioning, peti-tioner would successfully adapt to prison if he was sentenced
to life imprisonment.Concerned that the jury might not understand that "life
imprisonment" did not carry with it the possibility of parole
in petitioner's case, defense counsel asked the trial judge toclarify this point by defining the term "life imprisonment"

for the jury in accordance with S. C. Code Ann. $ 24-21-640(Supp. 1993).

2 To buttress his request, petitioner proffered,

outside the presence of the jury, evidence conclusively establishing his parole ineligibility. On petitioner's behalf,
attorneys for the South Carolina Department of Correctionsand the Department of Probation, Parole and Pardons testified that any offender in petitioner's position was in factineligible for parole under South Carolina law. The prosecution did not challenge or question petitioner's parole ineli-gibility. Instead, it sought to elicit admissions from the witnesses that, notwithstanding petitioner's parole ineligibility,
petitioner might receive holiday furloughs or other forms of
early release. Even this effort was unsuccessful, however,

2 Section 24-21-640 states: "The board must not grant parole nor is
parole authorized to any prisoner serving a sentence for a second or subsequent conviction, following a separate sentencing from a prior conviction, for violent crimes as defined in Section 16-1-60." Petitioner's
earlier convictions for burglary in the first degree and criminal sexual
assault in the first degree are violent offenses under $ 16-1-60.

as the cross-examination revealed that Department of Corrections regulations prohibit petitioner's release under early
release programs such as work-release or supervised furloughs, and that no convicted murderer serving life without
parole ever had been furloughed or otherwise released for
any reason.

Petitioner then offered into evidence, without objection,
the results of a statewide public-opinion survey conducted
by the University of South Carolina's Institute for Public
Affairs. The survey had been conducted a few days before
petitioner's trial, and showed that only 7.1 percent of all
jury-eligible adults who were questioned firmly believed that
an inmate sentenced to life imprisonment in South Carolina
actually would be required to spend the rest of his life in
prison. See App. 152-154. Almost half of those surveyed
believed that a convicted murderer might be paroled within
20 years; nearly three-quarters thought that release certainly would occur in less than 30 years. Ibid. More than
75 percent of those surveyed indicated that if they were
called upon to make a capital sentencing decision as jurors,
the amount of time the convicted murderer actually would
have to spend in prison would be an "extremely important"
or a "very important" factor in choosing between life and
death. Id., at 155.

Petitioner argued that, in view of the public's apparent
misunderstanding about the meaning of "life imprisonment"
in South Carolina, there was a reasonable likelihood that the
jurors would vote for death simply because they believed,
mistakenly, that petitioner eventually would be released on
parole.

The prosecution opposed the proposed instruction, urging
the court "not to allow . . . any argument by state or defense
about parole and not charge the jury on anything concerning
parole." Id., at 37. Citing the South Carolina Supreme
Court's opinion in State v. Torrence, 305 S. C. 45, 406 S. E.

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
2d 315 (1991), the trial court refused petitioner's requestedinstruction. Petitioner then asked alternatively for the

following instruction:

"I charge you that these sentences mean what theysay. That is, if you recommend that the defendant Jonathan Simmons be sentenced to death, he actually willbe sentenced to death and executed. If, on the other
hand, you recommend that he be sentenced to life im-prisonment, he actually will be sentenced to imprisonment in the state penitentiary for the balance of hisnatural life.

"In your deliberations, you are not to speculate thatthese sentences mean anything other than what I have
just told you, for what I have told you is exactly whatwill happen to the defendant, depending on what your
sentencing decision is." App. 162.
The trial judge also refused to give this instruction, but in-dicated that he might give a similar instruction if the jury

inquired about parole eligibility.After deliberating on petitioner's sentence for 90 minutes,
the jury sent a note to the judge asking a single question:"Does the imposition of a life sentence carry with it the possibility of parole?" Id., at 145. Over petitioner's objection,the trial judge gave the following instruction:

"You are instructed not to consider parole or paroleeligibility in reaching your verdict. Do not consider
parole or parole eligibility. That is not a proper issuefor your consideration. The terms life imprisonment
and death sentence are to be understood in their plan[sic] and ordinary meaning."

Id., at 146.

Twenty-five minutes after receiving this response from thecourt, the jury returned to the courtroom with a sentence

of death.On appeal to the South Carolina Supreme Court, petitioner argued that the trial judge's refusal to provide thejury accurate information regarding his parole ineligibil512us1$74F 12-24-97 08:39:41 PAGES OPINPGT

ity violated the Eighth Amendment and the Due ProcessClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

3 The South Carolina

Supreme Court declined to reach the merits of petitioner'schallenges. With one justice dissenting, it concluded that,

regardless of whether a trial court's refusal to inform a sen-tencing jury about a defendant's parole ineligibility might
be error under some circumstances, the instruction given topetitioner's jury "satisfie[d] in substance [petitioner's] request for a charge on parole ineligibility," and thus there wasno reason to consider whether denial of such an instruction
would be constitutional error in this case. 310 S. C. 439, 444,427 S. E. 2d 175, 179 (1993). We granted certiorari, 510 U. S.
811 (1993). II

The Due Process Clause does not allow the execution of aperson "on the basis of information which he had no opportunity to deny or explain." Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S.349, 362 (1977). In this case, the jury reasonably may have
believed that petitioner could be released on parole if hewere not executed. To the extent this misunderstanding
pervaded the jury's deliberations, it had the effect of creatinga false choice between sentencing petitioner to death and
sentencing him to a limited period of incarceration. This

3 Specifically, petitioner argued that under the Eighth Amendment his
parole ineligibility was " `mitigating' in the sense that [it] might serve `as
a basis for a sentence less than death,' " Skipper v. South Carolina, 476
U. S. 1, 4-5 (1986), quoting Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604 (1978)
(plurality opinion), and that therefore he was entitled to inform the jury
of his parole ineligibility. He also asserted that by withholding from the
jury the fact that it had a life-without-parole sentencing alternative, the
trial court impermissibly diminished the reliability of the jury's determination that death was the appropriate punishment. Cf. Beck v. Alabama,
447 U. S. 625 (1980). Finally, relying on the authority of Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349 (1977), petitioner argued that his due process right to
rebut the State's argument that petitioner posed a future danger to society
had been violated by the trial court's refusal to permit him to show that
a noncapital sentence adequately could protect the public from any future
acts of violence by him.

grievous misperception was encouraged by the trial court'srefusal to provide the jury with accurate information regarding petitioner's parole ineligibility, and by the State'srepeated suggestion that petitioner would pose a future danger to society if he were not executed. Three times peti-tioner asked to inform the jury that in fact he was ineligible
for parole under state law; three times his request was de-nied. The State thus succeeded in securing a death sentence on the ground, at least in part, of petitioner's futuredangerousness, while at the same time concealing from the
sentencing jury the true meaning of its noncapital sentencingalternative, namely, that life imprisonment meant life without parole. We think it is clear that the State denied peti-tioner due process.

A

This Court has approved the jury's consideration of futuredangerousness during the penalty phase of a capital trial,

recognizing that a defendant's future dangerousness bears onall sentencing determinations made in our criminal justice
system. See Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262, 275 (1976) ( jointopinion of Stewart, Powell, and

Stevens, JJ.) (noting that"any sentencing authority must predict a convicted person's

probable future conduct when it engages in the process ofdetermining what punishment to impose");

California v.
Ramos, 463 U. S. 992, 1003, n. 17 (1983) (explaining that itis proper for a sentencing jury in a capital case to consider

"the defendant's potential for reform and whether his proba-ble future behavior counsels against the desirability of his
release into society").

Although South Carolina statutes do not mandate consid-eration of the defendant's future dangerousness in capital

sentencing, the State's evidence in aggravation is not limitedto evidence relating to statutory aggravating circumstances.

4 We express no opinion on the question whether the result we reach
today is also compelled by the Eighth Amendment.

See Barclay v. Florida, 463 U. S. 939, 948-951 (1983) (plural-ity opinion);

California v. Ramos, 463 U. S., at 1008 ("Once
the jury finds that the defendant falls within the legislativelydefined category of persons eligible for the death penalty . . .

the jury then is free to consider a myriad of factors to determine whether death is the appropriate punishment").Thus, prosecutors in South Carolina, like those in other

States that impose the death penalty, frequently emphasizea defendant's future dangerousness in their evidence and argument at the sentencing phase; they urge the jury to sen-tence the defendant to death so that he will not be a danger
to the public if released from prison. Eisenberg & Wells,
Deadly Confusion: Juror Instructions in Capital Cases, 79
Cornell L. Rev. 1, 4 (1993).

Arguments relating to a defendant's future dangerousness
ordinarily would be inappropriate at the guilt phase of a
trial, as the jury is not free to convict a defendant simply
because he poses a future danger; nor is a defendant's future
dangerousness likely relevant to the question whether each
element of an alleged offense has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. But where the jury has sentencing responsibilities in a capital trial, many issues that are irrelevant to
the guilt-innocence determination step into the foreground
and require consideration at the sentencing phase. The defendant's character, prior criminal history, mental capacity,
background, and age are just a few of the many factors, in
addition to future dangerousness, that a jury may consider
in fixing appropriate punishment. See Lockett v. Ohio, 438
U. S. 586 (1978); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 110
(1982); Barclay v. Florida, 463 U. S., at 948-951.

In assessing future dangerousness, the actual duration of
the defendant's prison sentence is indisputably relevant.
Holding all other factors constant, it is entirely reasonable
for a sentencing jury to view a defendant who is eligible for
parole as a greater threat to society than a defendant who is
not. Indeed, there may be no greater assurance of a defend512us1$74F 12-24-97 08:39:41 PAGES OPINPGT

ant's future nondangerousness to the public than the factthat he never will be released on parole. The trial court's

refusal to apprise the jury of information so crucial to itssentencing determination, particularly when the prosecution
alluded to the defendant's future dangerousness in its argu-ment to the jury, cannot be reconciled with our wellestablished precedents interpreting the Due Process Clause.

B
In Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1 (1986), this Courtheld that a defendant was denied due process by the refusal

of the state trial court to admit evidence of the defendant'sgood behavior in prison in the penalty phase of his capital
trial. Although the majority opinion stressed that the de-fendant's good behavior in prison was "relevant evidence in
mitigation of punishment," and thus admissible under theEighth Amendment,

id., at 4, citing Lockett v. Ohio, 438U. S., at 604 (plurality opinion), the Skipper opinion expressly noted that the Court's conclusion also was compelledby the Due Process Clause. The Court explained that
where the prosecution relies on a prediction of future dan-gerousness in requesting the death penalty, elemental due
process principles operate to require admission of the de-fendant's relevant evidence in rebuttal. 476 U. S., at 5, n. 1.
See also id., at 9 (Powell, J., opinion concurring in judgment)("[B]ecause petitioner was not allowed to rebut evidence and
argument used against him," the defendant clearly was de-nied due process).

The Court reached a similar conclusion in Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349 (1977). In that case, a defendant was sen-tenced to death on the basis of a presentence report which

was not made available to him and which he therefore couldnot rebut. A plurality of the Court explained that sending
a man to his death "on the basis of information which hehad no opportunity to deny or explain" violated fundamental notions of due process. Id., at 362. The principle an512us1$74F 12-24-97 08:39:41 PAGES OPINPGT

nounced in Gardner was reaffirmed in Skipper, and it com-pels our decision today. See also Crane v. Kentucky, 476

U. S. 683, 690 (1986) (due process entitles a defendant to " `ameaningful opportunity to present a complete defense' ") (citation omitted); Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, 83-87 (1985)(where the State presents psychiatric evidence of a defendant's future dangerousness at a capital sentencing proceed-ing, due process entitles an indigent defendant to the assistance of a psychiatrist for the development of his defense).Like the defendants in

Skipper and Gardner, petitionerwas prevented from rebutting information that the sentencing authority considered, and upon which it may have relied,in imposing the sentence of death. The State raised the
specter of petitioner's future dangerousness generally, butthen thwarted all efforts by petitioner to demonstrate that,
contrary to the prosecutor's intimations, he never would bereleased on parole and thus, in his view, would not pose a
future danger to society.5 The logic and effectiveness ofpetitioner's argument naturally depended on the fact that he
was legally ineligible for parole and thus would remain inprison if afforded a life sentence. Petitioner's efforts to
focus the jury's attention on the question whether, in prison,he would be a future danger were futile, as he repeatedly
was denied any opportunity to inform the jury that he neverwould be released on parole. The jury was left to speculate
about petitioner's parole eligibility when evaluating peti-tioner's future dangerousness, and was denied a straight an5 Of course, the fact that a defendant is parole ineligible does not prevent
the State from arguing that the defendant poses a future danger. The
State is free to argue that the defendant will pose a danger to others in
prison and that executing him is the only means of eliminating the threat
to the safety of other inmates or prison staff. But the State may not
mislead the jury by concealing accurate information about the defendant's
parole ineligibility. The Due Process Clause will not tolerate placing a
capital defendant in a straitjacket by barring him from rebutting the
prosecution's arguments of future dangerousness with the fact that he is
ineligible for parole under state law.

swer about petitioner's parole eligibility even when it wasrequested.

C
The State and its amici contend that petitioner was notentitled to an instruction informing the jury that petitioner

is ineligible for parole because such information is inherentlymisleading.

6 Essentially, they argue that because future exigencies such as legislative reform, commutation, clemency,and escape might allow petitioner to be released into society,

petitioner was not entitled to inform the jury that he is pa-role ineligible. Insofar as this argument is targeted at the
specific wording of the instruction petitioner requested, theargument is misplaced. Petitioner's requested instruction
("If . . . you recommend that [the defendant] be sentenced tolife imprisonment, he actually will be sentenced to imprisonment in the state penitentiary for the balance of his naturallife," App. 162) was proposed only after the trial court ruled
that South Carolina law prohibited a plain-language instruc-tion that petitioner was ineligible for parole under state law.
To the extent that the State opposes even a simple parole-ineligibility instruction because of hypothetical future developments, the argument has little force. Respondent admitsthat an instruction informing the jury that petitioner is ineligible for parole is legally accurate. Certainly, such an in-struction is more accurate than no instruction at all, which
leaves the jury to speculate whether "life imprisonment"means life without parole or something else.

The State's asserted accuracy concerns are further under-mined by the fact that a large majority of States which pro6 In this regard, the State emphasizes that no statute prohibits petitioner's eventual release into society. While this technically may be true,
state regulations unambiguously prohibit work-release and virtually all
other furloughs for inmates who are ineligible for parole. See App. 16.

"the most extraordinary circumstances." S. C. Code Ann. $ 24-21-950D

7 At present, there are 26 States that both employ juries in capital sentencing and provide for life imprisonment without parole as an alternative
to capital punishment. In 17 of these, the jury expressly is informed of
the defendant's ineligibility for parole. Nine States simply identify the
jury's sentencing alternatives as death and life without parole. See Ala.

States allow the jury to specify whether the defendant should or should
not be eligible for parole. See Ga. Code Ann. $ 17-10-31.1(a) (Supp. 1993);
Ind. Code $ 35-50-2-9 (Supp. 1993); Md. Ann. Code, Art. 27, $ 413(c)(3)

207(4) (Supp. 1993).

In three States, statutory or decisional law requires that the sentencing
jury be instructed, where accurate, that the defendant will be ineligible
for parole. See Colo. Rev. Stat. $ 16-11-103(1)(b) (Supp. 1993); People v.
Gacho, 122 Ill. 2d 221, 262, 522 N. E. 2d 1146, 1166 (1988); Turner v. State,
573 So. 2d 657, 675 (Miss. 1990), cert. denied, 500 U. S. 910 (1991).

Three States have not considered the question whether jurors should
be instructed that the defendant is ineligible for parole under state law.
See Fla. Stat. Ann. $ 775.0823(1) (Supp. 1994); S. D. Codified Laws $ 24-
15-4 (1988); Wyo. Stat. $$ 6-2-101(b), 7-13-402(a) (1993). The Florida Supreme Court, however, has approved for publication pattern jury instructions that inform capital sentencing juries of the no-parole feature of

Cases No. 92-1, 603 So. 2d 1175, 1205 (Fla. 1992).

Finally, there are four States in which the capital sentencing decision is
made by the trial judge alone or by a sentencing panel of judges. Thus,
in these States, as well, the sentencing authority is fully aware of the
precise parole status of life-sentenced murderers. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.

does here, on the proposition that California v. Ramos, 463U. S. 992 (1983), held that such determinations are purely

matters of state law.8It is true that Ramos stands for the broad proposition that
we generally will defer to a State's determination as to whata jury should and should not be told about sentencing. In
a State in which parole is available, how the jury's knowl-edge of parole availability will affect the decision whether or
not to impose the death penalty is speculative, and we shallnot lightly second-guess a decision whether or not to inform
a jury of information regarding parole. States reasonablymay conclude that truthful information regarding the availability of commutation, pardon, and the like should be keptfrom the jury in order to provide "greater protection in [the
States'] criminal justice system than the Federal Consti-tution requires." Id., at 1014. Concomitantly, nothing in
the Constitution prohibits the prosecution from arguingany truthful information relating to parole or other forms of
early release.But if the State rests its case for imposing the death penalty at least in part on the premise that the defendant will

8 Only two States other than South Carolina have a life-without-parole
sentencing alternative to capital punishment for some or all convicted
murderers but refuse to inform sentencing juries of this fact. See Commonwealth v. Henry, 524 Pa. 135, 160, 569 A. 2d 929, 941 (1990), cert.

Justice Scalia points out that two additional States, Texas and North
Carolina, traditionally have kept information about a capital defendant's
parole ineligibility from the sentencing jury. See post, at 179. Neither
of these States, however, has a life-without-parole sentencing alternative
to capital punishment. It is also worthy of note that, pursuant to recently
enacted legislation, North Carolina now requires trial courts to instruct
capital sentencing juries concerning parole eligibility. See 1993 N. C.

be dangerous in the future, the fact that the alternative sen-tence to death is life without parole will necessarily undercut

the State's argument regarding the threat the defendantposes to society. Because truthful information of parole
ineligibility allows the defendant to "deny or explain" theshowing of future dangerousness, due process plainly requires that he be allowed to bring it to the jury's attentionby way of argument by defense counsel or an instruction
from the court. See Gardner, 430 U. S., at 362.

There remains to be considered whether the South Caro-lina Supreme Court was correct in concluding that the trial

court "satisfie[d] in substance [petitioner's] request for acharge on parole ineligibility," 310 S. C., at 444, 427 S. E. 2d,
at 179, when it responded to the jury's query by stating thatlife imprisonment was to be understood in its "plain and
ordinary meaning," ibid. In the court's view, petitionerbasically received the parole-ineligibility instruction he requested. We disagree.It can hardly be questioned that most juries lack accurate
information about the precise meaning of "life imprison-ment" as defined by the States. For much of our country's
history, parole was a mainstay of state and federal sentenc-ing regimes, and every term (whether a term of life or a
term of years) in practice was understood to be shorter thanthe stated term. See generally Lowenthal, Mandatory
Sentencing Laws: Undermining the Effectiveness of De-terminate Sentencing Reform, 81 Calif. L. Rev. 61 (1993)
(describing the development of mandatory sentencing laws).Increasingly, legislatures have enacted mandatory sentencing laws with severe penalty provisions, yet the precise con-tours of these penal laws vary from State to State. See

An instruction directing juries that life imprisonmentshould be understood in its "plain and ordinary" meaning

does nothing to dispel the misunderstanding reasonable ju-rors may have about the way in which any particular State
defines "life imprisonment." 10 See Boyde v. California, 494U. S. 370, 380 (1990) (where there is a "reasonable likelihood

evidence," the defendant is denied due process).It is true, as the State points out, that the trial court admonished the jury that "you are instructed not to considerparole" and that parole "is not a proper issue for your consideration." App. 146. Far from ensuring that the jury wasnot misled, however, this instruction actually suggested that
parole was available but that the jury, for some unstatedreason, should be blind to this fact. Undoubtedly, the instruction was confusing and frustrating to the jury, given

9 Public opinion and juror surveys support the commonsense understanding that there is a reasonable likelihood of juror confusion about the
meaning of the term "life imprisonment." See Paduano & Smith, Deadly
Errors: Juror Misperceptions Concerning Parole in the Imposition of the
Death Penalty, 18 Colum. Human Rights L. Rev. 211, 222-225 (1987); Note,

10 It almost goes without saying that if the jury in this case understood

that the "plain meaning" of "life imprisonment" was life without parole in
South Carolina, there would have been no reason for the jury to inquire
about petitioner's parole eligibility.

the arguments by both the prosecution and the defense re-lating to petitioner's future dangerousness, and the obvious

relevance of petitioner's parole ineligibility to the jury's for-midable sentencing task. While juries ordinarily are presumed to follow the court's instructions, see Greer v. Miller,483 U. S. 756, 766, n. 8 (1987), we have recognized that in
some circumstances "the risk that the jury will not, or can-not, follow instructions is so great, and the consequences of
failure so vital to the defendant, that the practical and humanlimitations of the jury system cannot be ignored."

Brutonv. United States, 391 U. S. 123, 135 (1968). See also Beck v.

Alabama, 447 U. S. 625, 642 (1980); Barclay v. Florida, 463U. S., at 950 ("Any sentencing decision calls for the exercise
of judgment. It is neither possible nor desirable for a per-son to whom the State entrusts an important judgment to
decide in a vacuum, as if he had no experiences").But even if the trial court's instruction successfully prevented the jury from considering parole, petitioner's dueprocess rights still were not honored. Because petitioner's
future dangerousness was at issue, he was entitled to informthe jury of his parole ineligibility. An instruction directing
the jury not to consider the defendant's likely conduct inprison would not have satisfied due process in Skipper v.
South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1 (1986), and, for the same rea-sons, the instruction issued by the trial court in this case
does not satisfy due process.

IV
The State may not create a false dilemma by advancinggeneralized arguments regarding the defendant's future dangerousness while, at the same time, preventing the jury fromlearning that the defendant never will be released on parole.
The judgment of the South Carolina Supreme Court accord-ingly is reversed, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings. It is so ordered.

I join in Justice Blackmun's opinion that, at least whenfuture dangerousness is an issue in a capital sentencing determination, the defendant has a due process right to requirethat his sentencing jury be informed of his ineligibility for
parole. I write separately because I believe an additional,related principle also compels today's decision, regardless of
whether future dangerousness is an issue at sentencing.The Eighth Amendment entitles a defendant to a jury capable of a reasoned moral judgment about whether death,
rather than some lesser sentence, ought to be imposed. TheCourt has explained that the Amendment imposes a heightened standard "for reliability in the determination that death
is the appropriate punishment in a specific case," Woodsonv.

North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, 305 (1976) (plurality opinion
of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.); see also, e. g., Godfreyv.

Georgia, 446 U. S. 420, 427-428 (1980); Mills v. Maryland,
486 U. S. 367, 383-384 (1988). Thus, it requires provision of"accurate sentencing information [as] an indispensable prerequisite to a reasoned determination of whether a defendantshall live or die,"

Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 190 (1976)
( joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.), and invalidates "procedural rules that ten[d] to diminish the relia-bility of the sentencing determination,"

Beck v. Alabama,
447 U. S. 625, 638 (1980).That same need for heightened reliability also mandates

recognition of a capital defendant's right to require instruc-tions on the meaning of the legal terms used to describe the
sentences (or sentencing recommendations) a jury is requiredto consider, in making the reasoned moral choice between
sentencing alternatives. Thus, whenever there is a reasonable likelihood that a juror will misunderstand a sentencingterm, a defendant may demand instruction on its meaning,

and a death sentence following the refusal of such a request

Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 249 (1972) (Douglas, J., con-curring) (internal quotation marks omitted);

id., at 310
(Stewart, J., concurring).

While I join the other Members of the Court's majority inholding that, at least, counsel ought to be permitted to inform the jury of the law that it must apply, see ante, at 169(plurality opinion);

post, at 174 (Ginsburg, J., concurring);
post, at 178 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment), I alsoaccept the general rule that, on matters of law, arguments of

counsel do not effectively substitute for statements by thecourt.

"[A]rguments of counsel generally carry less weightwith a jury than do instructions from the court. The
former are usually billed in advance to the jury as mat-ters of argument, not evidence, and are likely viewed as
the statements of advocates; the latter, we have often
recognized, are viewed as definitive and binding statements of the law." Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370,
384 (1990) (citation omitted).

I would thus impose that straightforward duty on the court.

Because Justice Blackmun persuasively demonstrates
that juries in general are likely to misunderstand the meaning of the term "life imprisonment" in a given context, see
ante, at 159, 169-170, and n. 9, the judge must tell the jury
what the term means, when the defendant so requests. It
is, moreover, clear that at least one of these particular jurors
did not understand the meaning of the term, since the jury
sent a note to the judge asking, "Does the imposition of a
life sentence carry with it the possibility of parole?" Ante,
at 160, 170, n. 10. The answer here was easy and controlled
by state statute. The judge should have said no. Justice
Blackmun shows that the instruction actually given was at

and that "there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury hasapplied the challenged instruction in a way" that violated

petitioner's rights. Boyde, supra, at 380. By effectively
withholding from the jury the life-without-parole alternative,
the trial court diminished the reliability of the jury's decision
that death, rather than that alternative, was the appropriate
penalty in this case.

While States are, of course, free to provide more protection for the accused than the Constitution requires, see California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992, 1014 (1983), they may not
provide less. South Carolina did so here. For these reasons, as well as those set forth by Justice Blackmun,
whose opinion I join, the judgment of the Supreme Court of
South Carolina must be reversed.

Justice Ginsburg, concurring.
This case is most readily resolved under a core requirement of due process, the right to be heard. Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 683, 690 (1986). When the prosecution
urges a defendant's future dangerousness as cause for the
death sentence, the defendant's right to be heard means that
he must be afforded an opportunity to rebut the argument.
See Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 5, n. 1 (1986).
To be full and fair, that opportunity must include the right
to inform the jury, if it is indeed the case, that the defendant
is ineligible for parole. Justice Blackmun's opinion is in
accord with Justice O'Connor's on this essential point.
See ante, at 164, 165-166, 168-169; post, at 176-178.

As a subsidiary matter, Justice O'Connor's opinion clarifies that the due process requirement is met if the relevant
information is intelligently conveyed to the jury; due process
does not dictate that the judge herself, rather than defense
counsel, provide the instruction. See post, at 177-178. I do

not read Justice Blackmun's opinion to say otherwise.*And I note that the trial court here not only refused to instruct

the jury that in this case life means "life without parole"; thecourt also ordered petitioner's counsel to refrain from saying
anything to the jury about parole ineligibility. App. 55-57.On these understandings, I concur in

Justice Blackmun's opinion.

Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Kennedy join, concurring in the judgment.

"Capital sentencing proceedings must of course satisfy thedictates of the Due Process Clause,"

Clemons v. Mississippi,494 U. S. 738, 746 (1990), and one of the hallmarks of due

process in our adversary system is the defendant's ability tomeet the State's case against him. Cf.

Crane v. Kentucky,476 U. S. 683, 690 (1986). In capital cases, we have held that

the defendant's future dangerousness is a consideration onwhich the State may rely in seeking the death penalty. See
California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992, 1002-1003 (1983). But"[w]here the prosecution specifically relies on a prediction

of future dangerousness in asking for the death penalty, . . .the elemental due process requirement that a defendant not
be sentenced to death `on the basis of information which hehad no opportunity to deny or explain' [requires that the defendant be afforded an opportunity to introduce evidence onthis point]."

ing, the State sought to show that petitioner is a viciouspredator who would pose a continuing threat to the community. The prosecutor argued that the jury's role was to de-cide "what to do with [petitioner] now that he is in our
midst," App. 110, and told the jury: "Your verdict should be
a response of society to someone who is a threat. Your ver-dict will be an act of self-defense,"

ibid.; see also id., at 102,
112. Petitioner's response was that he only preyed onelderly women, a class of victims he would not encounter

behind bars. See id., at 121; ante, at 157 (plurality opinion).This argument stood a chance of succeeding, if at all, only if
the jury were convinced that petitioner would stay in prison.
Although the only available alternative sentence to death in
petitioner's case was life imprisonment without possibility of
parole, S. C. Code Ann. $$ 16-3-20(A) and 24-21-640 (Supp.
1993), the trial court precluded the jury from learning that
petitioner would never be released from prison.

Unlike in Skipper, where the defendant sought to introduce factual evidence tending to disprove the State's showing of future dangerousness, see 476 U. S., at 3; id., at 10-11
(Powell, J., concurring in judgment), petitioner sought to rely
on the operation of South Carolina's sentencing law in arguing that he would not pose a threat to the community if
he were sentenced to life imprisonment. We have previously noted with approval, however, that "[m]any state
courts have held it improper for the jury to consider or to
be informed--through argument or instruction--of the possibility of commutation, pardon, or parole." California v.
Ramos, 463 U. S., at 1013, n. 30. The decision whether or
not to inform the jury of the possibility of early release is
generally left to the States. See id., at 1014. In a State in
which parole is available, the Constitution does not require
(or preclude) jury consideration of that fact. Likewise, if
the prosecution does not argue future dangerousness, the
State may appropriately decide that parole is not a proper
issue for the jury's consideration even if the only alternative

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
sentence to death is life imprisonment without possibility ofparole.

When the State seeks to show the defendant's future dan-gerousness, however, the fact that he will never be released
from prison will often be the only way that a violent criminal
can successfully rebut the State's case. I agree with theCourt that in such a case the defendant should be allowed to

bring his parole ineligibility to the jury's attention--by wayof argument by defense counsel or an instruction from the
court--as a means of responding to the State's showing offuture dangerousness. And despite our general deference
to state decisions regarding what the jury should be told
about sentencing, I agree that due process requires that the
defendant be allowed to do so in cases in which the only
available alternative sentence to death is life imprisonment
without possibility of parole and the prosecution argues that
the defendant will pose a threat to society in the future. Of
course, in such cases the prosecution is free to argue that the
defendant would be dangerous in prison; the State may also
(though it need not) inform the jury of any truthful information regarding the availability of commutation, pardon, and
the like. See id., at 1001-1009.

The prosecutor in this case put petitioner's future dangerousness in issue, but petitioner was not permitted to argue
parole ineligibility to the capital sentencing jury. Although
the trial judge instructed the jurors that "[t]he terms life
imprisonment and death sentence are to be understood in
their pla[i]n and ordinary meaning," App. 146, I cannot agree
with the court below that this instruction "satisfie[d] in substance [petitioner's] request for a charge on parole ineligibility." 310 S. C. 439, 444, 427 S. E. 2d 175, 179 (1993). The
rejection of parole by many States (and the Federal Government) is a recent development that displaces the longstanding practice of parole availability, see ante, at 169-170 (plurality opinion), and common sense tells us that many jurors
might not know whether a life sentence carries with it the

512us1$74J 12-24-97 08:39:41 PAGES OPINPGT

Scalia, J., dissenting
possibility of parole. While it may come to pass that the"plain and ordinary meaning" of a life sentence is life without

parole, that the jury in this case felt compelled to askwhether parole was available shows that the jurors did not
know whether or not a life-sentenced defendant will be released from prison. Moreover, the prosecutor, by referringto a verdict of death as an act of "self-defense," strongly

implied that petitioner would be let out eventually if the jurydid not recommend a death sentence.

Where the State puts the defendant's future dangerous-ness in issue, and the only available alternative sentence to
death is life imprisonment without possibility of parole, dueprocess entitles the defendant to inform the capital sentencing jury--by either argument or instruction--that he is parole ineligible. In this case, the prosecution argued at the
capital sentencing proceeding that petitioner would be dangerous in the future. Although the only alternative sentence to death under state law was life imprisonment without possibility of parole, petitioner was not allowed to argue
to the jury that he would never be released from prison,
and the trial judge's instruction did not communicate this
information to the jury. I therefore concur in the Court's
judgment that petitioner was denied the due process of law
to which he is constitutionally entitled.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,
dissenting.

Today's judgment certainly seems reasonable enough as a
determination of what a capital sentencing jury should be
permitted to consider. That is not, however, what it purports to be. It purports to be a determination that any capital sentencing scheme that does not permit jury consideration of such material is so incompatible with our national
traditions of criminal procedure that it violates the Due
Process Clause of the Constitution of the United States.
There is really no basis for such a pronouncement, neither in

any near uniform practice of our people, nor in the jurisprudence of this Court.

With respect to the former I shall discuss only current
practice, since the parties and amici have addressed only
that, and since traditional practice may be relatively uninformative with regard to the new schemes of capital sentencing
imposed upon the States by this Court's recent jurisprudence. The overwhelming majority of the 32 States that
permit juries to impose or recommend capital sentences do
not allow specific information regarding parole to be given to
the jury. To be sure, in many of these States the sentencing
choices specifically include "life without parole," so that the
jury charge itself conveys the information whether parole is
available. In at least eight of those States, however, the
jury's choice is not merely between "life without parole" and
"death," but among some variation of (parole eligible) "life,"
"life without parole," and "death" 1--so that the precise date
of availability of parole is relevant to the jury's choice. Moreover, even among those States that permit the jury to choose
only between "life" (unspecified) and "death," South Carolina
is not alone in keeping parole information from the jury.
Four other States in widely separated parts of the country
follow that same course,2 and there are other States that lack

which, according to today's opinions, the Constitution re-quires.

4 This picture of national practice falls far short of

demonstrating a principle so widely shared that it is part ofeven a current and temporary American consensus.

As for our prior jurisprudence: The opinions of Justice
Blackmun and Justice O'Connor rely on the FourteenthAmendment's guarantee of due process, rather than on the

Eighth Amendment's "cruel and unusual punishments" pro-hibition, as applied to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. But cf. ante, at 172 (Souter, J., concurring). Theprior law applicable to that subject indicates that petitioner's
due process rights would be violated if he was "sentenced todeath `on the basis of information which he had no opportunity to deny or explain.' " Skipper v. South Carolina, 476U. S. 1, 5, n. 1 (1986), quoting

Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S.349, 362 (1977). Both opinions try to bring this case within

that description, but it does not fit.The opinions paint a picture of a prosecutor who repeatedly stressed that petitioner would pose a threat to soci-ety

upon his release. The record tells a different story.

and "death" and have not squarely decided whether the jury should receive information about parole include South Dakota, see S. D. Codified

Scalia, J., dissenting
Rather than emphasizing future dangerousness as a crucialfactor, the prosecutor stressed the nature of petitioner's

crimes: the crime that was the subject of the prosecution,the brutal murder of a 79-year-old woman in her home, and
three prior crimes confessed to by petitioner, all rapes and
beatings of elderly women, one of them his grandmother. Iam sure it was the sheer depravity of those crimes, rather

than any specific fear for the future, which induced the SouthCarolina jury to conclude that the death penalty was justice.

Not only, moreover, was future dangerousness not empha-sized, but future dangerousness

outside of prison was not
even mentioned. The trial judge undertook specifically toprevent that, in response to the broader request of petitioner's counsel that the prosecutor be prevented from arguing
future dangerousness at all:

"Obviously, I will listen carefully to the argument of thesolicitor to see if it contravenes the actual factual circumstance. Certainly, I recognize the right of the State
to argue concerning the defendant's dangerous propen-sity. I will not allow the solicitor, for example, to say

to the jury anything that would indicate that the defend-ant is not going to be jailed for the period of time that
is encompassed within the actual law. The fact that wedo not submit the parole eligibility to the jury does not
negate the fact that the solicitor must stay within thetrial record." App. 56-57.

As I read the record, the prosecutor followed this admo-nition--and the Due Process Clause requires nothing more.

Both Justice Blackmun and Justice O'Connor focus on
two portions of the prosecutor's final argument to the jury in
the sentencing phase. First, they stress that the prosecutor
asked the jury to answer the question of "what to do with
[petitioner] now that he is in our midst." That statement,
however, was not made (as they imply) in the course of an
argument about future dangerousness, but was a response to

512us1$74K 12-24-97 08:39:41 PAGES OPINPGT
182 SIMMONS v. SOUTH CAROLINA

Scalia, J., dissenting
petitioner's mitigating evidence. Read in context, the state-ment is not even relevant to the issue in this case:

"The defense in this case as to sentence . . . [is] adiversion. It's putting the blame on society, on his
father, on his grandmother, on whoever else he can,spreading it out to avoid that personal responsibility.
That he came from a deprived background. That hedidn't have all of the breaks in life and certainly that
helps shape someone. But we are not concerned abouthow he got shaped. We are concerned about what to
do with him now that he is in our midst." Id., at 110.
Both opinions also seize upon the prosecutor's comment thatthe jury's verdict would be "an act of self-defense." That

statement came at the end of admonition of the jury to avoidemotional responses and enter a rational verdict:

"Your verdict shouldn't be returned in anger. Yourverdict shouldn't be an emotional catharsis. Your verdict shouldn't be . . . a response to that eight-year-oldkid [testifying in mitigation] and really shouldn't be a
response to the gruesome grotesque handiwork of [peti-tioner]. Your verdict should be a response of society to
someone who is a threat. Your verdict will be an act ofself-defense."

Id., at 109-110.

This reference to "self-defense" obviously alluded, neither todefense of the jurors' own persons, nor specifically to defense

of persons outside the prison walls, but to defense of allmembers of society against this individual, wherever he or
they might be. Thus, as I read the record (and bear in mindthat the trial judge was on the lookout with respect to this
point), the prosecutor did not invite the jury to believe thatpetitioner would be eligible for parole--he did not

misleadthe jury.

The rule the majority adopts in order to overturn this sen-tence therefore goes well beyond what would be necessary
to counteract prosecutorial misconduct (a disposition with

which I might agree). It is a rule at least as sweeping asthis: that the Due Process Clause overrides state law limiting the admissibility of information concerning parole whenever the prosecution argues future dangerousness. Justice
Blackmun appears to go even further, requiring the admission of parole ineligibility even when the prosecutor does notargue future dangerousness. See

ante, at 163-164; but see
ante, at 174 (Ginsburg, J., concurring). I do not under-stand the basis for this broad prescription. As a general

matter, the Court leaves it to the States to strike what theyconsider the appropriate balance among the many factors--
probative value, prejudice, reliability, potential for confusion,
among others--that determine whether evidence ought to be
admissible. Even in the capital punishment context, the
Court has noted that "the wisdom of the decision to permit
juror consideration of [postsentencing contingencies] is best
left to the States." California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992, 1014
(1983). "[T]he States, and not this Court, retain `the traditional authority' to determine what particular evidence . . .
is relevant." Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S., at 11
(Powell, J., concurring in judgment). One reason for leaving
it that way is that a sensible code of evidence cannot be
invented piecemeal. Each item cannot be considered in isolation, but must be given its place within the whole. Preventing the defense from introducing evidence regarding parolability is only half of the rule that prevents the prosecution
from introducing it as well. If the rule is changed for defendants, many will think that evenhandedness demands a
change for prosecutors as well. State's attorneys ought to
be able to say that if, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you
do not impose capital punishment upon this defendant (or if
you impose anything less than life without parole) he may
be walking the streets again in eight years! Many would
not favor the admission of such an argument--but would prefer it to a state scheme in which defendants can call attention
to the unavailability of parole, but prosecutors cannot note

Scalia, J., dissenting
its availability. This Court should not force state legislatorsinto such a difficult choice unless the isolated state evidentiary rule that the Court has before it is not merely less thanideal, but beyond a high threshold of unconstitutionality.

The low threshold the Court constructs today is difficult to reconcile with our almost simultaneous decision in
Romano v. Oklahoma, ante, p. 1. There, the Court holds
that the proper inquiry when evidence is admitted in contra-vention of a state law is "whether the admission of evidence

. . . so infected the sentencing proceeding with unfairness asto render the jury's imposition of the death penalty a denial
of due process." Ante, at 12. I do not see why the unconstitutionality criterion for excluding evidence in accordance
with state law should be any less demanding than the unconstitutionality criterion Romano recites for admitting evidence in violation of state law: "fundamental unfairness."
And "fundamentally unfair" the South Carolina rule is assuredly not. The notion that the South Carolina jury imposed the death penalty "just in case" Simmons might be
released on parole seems to me quite farfetched. And the
notion that the decision taken on such grounds would have
been altered by information on the current state of the law
concerning parole (which could of course be amended) is even
more farfetched. And the scenario achieves the ultimate in
farfetchedness when there is added the fact that, according
to uncontroverted testimony of prison officials in this case,
even current South Carolina law (as opposed to discretionary
prison regulations) does not prohibit furloughs and workrelease programs for life-without-parole inmates. See App.
16-17.

When the prosecution has not specifically suggested parolability, I see no more reason why the United States Constitution should compel the admission of evidence showing that,
under the State's current law, the defendant would be nonparolable, than that it should compel the admission of evidence
showing that parolable life-sentence murderers are in fact

almost never paroled, or are paroled only after age 70; orevidence to the effect that escapes of life-without-parole inmates are rare; or evidence showing that, though under cur-rent law the defendant will be parolable in 20 years, the
recidivism rate for elderly prisoners released after longincarceration is negligible. All of this evidence may be
thought relevant to whether the death penalty should beimposed, and a petition raising the last of these claims has
already arrived. See Pet. for Cert. in Rudd v. Texas, O. T.1993, No. 93-7955.

As I said at the outset, the regime imposed by today'sjudgment is undoubtedly reasonable as a matter of policy,
but I see nothing to indicate that the Constitution requiresit to be followed coast to coast. I fear we have read today
the first page of a whole new chapter in the "death-is-different" jurisprudence which this Court is in the apparently continuous process of composing. It adds to our in-sistence that state courts admit "all relevant mitigating
evidence," see, e. g., Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104(1982);

Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978), a requirementthat they adhere to distinctive rules, more demanding than

what the Due Process Clause normally requires, for admit-ting evidence of other sorts--Federal Rules of Death Penalty
Evidence, so to speak, which this Court will presumablycraft (at great expense to the swiftness and predictability of
justice) year by year. The heavily outnumbered opponentsof capital punishment have successfully opened yet another
front in their guerilla war to make this unquestionably con-stitutional sentence a practical impossibility.

WEST LYNN CREAMERY, INC., et al. v. HEALY,COMMISSIONER OF MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE
certiorari to the supreme judicial court ofmassachusetts

No. 93-141. Argued March 2, 1994--Decided June 17, 1994
A Massachusetts pricing order subjects all fluid milk sold by dealers to

Massachusetts retailers to an assessment. Although most of that milk
is produced out of State, the entire assessment is distributed to Massachusetts dairy farmers. Petitioners--licensed dealers who purchase
milk produced by out-of-state farmers and sell it within Massachusetts--sued to enjoin enforcement of the order on the ground that it
violated the Federal Commerce Clause, but the state court denied relief.
The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed, concluding that
the order was not facially discriminatory, applied evenhandedly, and only
incidentally burdened interstate commerce, and that such burden was
outweighed by the "local benefits" to the dairy industry.

Held: The pricing order unconstitutionally discriminates against interstate commerce. Pp. 192-207.

(a) The order is clearly unconstitutional under this Court's decisions
invalidating state laws designed to benefit local producers of goods by
creating tariff-like barriers that neutralized the competitive and economic advantages possessed by lower cost out-of-state producers. See,
e. g., Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263. The "premium payments" are effectively a tax making milk produced out of State more
expensive. Although that tax also applies to milk produced in Massachusetts, its effect on Massachusetts producers is entirely (indeed more
than) offset by the subsidy provided exclusively to Massachusetts dairy
farmers, who are thereby empowered to sell at or below the price
charged by lower cost out-of-state producers. Pp. 192-197.

(b) Respondent's principal argument--that, because both the localsubsidy and nondiscriminatory-tax components of the order are valid,
the combination of the two is equally valid--is rejected. Even granting
respondent's assertion that both components of the pricing order would
be constitutional standing alone, the order must still fall because it is
funded principally from taxes on the sale of milk produced in other
States and therefore burdens interstate commerce. More fundamentally, the argument is logically flawed in its assumption that the lawfulness of each of two acts establishes the legality of their combination.

Indeed, by conjoining a tax and a subsidy, Massachusetts has created a
program more dangerous to interstate commerce than either part alone:
The Commonwealth's political processes cannot be relied on to prevent
legislative abuse where dairy farmers, one of the powerful in-state interests that would ordinarily be expected to lobby against the order
premium as a tax raising milk prices, have been mollified by the subsidy. Pp. 198-202.

(c) Respondent's second argument--that the order is not discriminatory because the dealers who pay premiums are not competitors of the
farmers who receive disbursements--cannot withstand scrutiny. The
imposition of a differential burden on any part of the stream of commerce--from wholesaler to retailer to consumer--is invalid because a
burden placed at any point will result in a disadvantage to the out-ofstate producer. Pp. 202-203.

(d) If accepted, respondent's third argument--that the order is not
protectionist because the program's costs are borne only by Massachusetts dealers and consumers and its benefits are distributed exclusively
to Massachusetts farmers--would undermine almost every discriminatory tax case. State taxes are ordinarily paid by in-state businesses
and consumers, yet if they discriminate against out-of-state products
they are unconstitutional. More fundamentally, the argument ignores
the fact that Massachusetts dairy farmers are part of an integrated interstate market. The obvious impact of the order on out-of-state production demonstrates that it is simply wrong to assume that it burdens
only in-state consumers and dealers. Pp. 203-204.

(e) Acceptance of respondent's final argument--that the order's incidental burden on commerce is justified by the local benefit of saving the
financially distressed dairy industry--would make a virtue of the vice
that the rule against discrimination condemns. Preservation of local
industry by protecting it from the rigors of interstate competition is
the hallmark of the economic protectionism that the Commerce Clause
prohibits. Pp. 204-207.

the brief were Scott Harshbarger, Attorney General, andEric E. Smith, Assistant Attorney General.*

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
A Massachusetts pricing order imposes an assessment onall fluid milk sold by dealers to Massachusetts retailers.

About two-thirds of that milk is produced out of State. Theentire assessment, however, is distributed to Massachusetts
dairy farmers. The question presented is whether the pric-ing order unconstitutionally discriminates against interstate
commerce. We hold that it does.

Petitioner West Lynn Creamery, Inc., is a milk dealer li-censed to do business in Massachusetts. It purchases raw

milk, which it processes, packages, and sells to wholesalers,retailers, and other milk dealers. About 97% of the raw
milk it purchases is produced by out-of-state farmers. Peti-tioner LeComte's Dairy, Inc., is also a licensed Massachusetts
milk dealer. It purchases all of its milk from West Lynn anddistributes it to retail outlets in Massachusetts.

Opinion of the Court
paid to producers of raw milk by issuing marketing ordersfor particular geographic areas.

1 While the Federal Government sets minimum prices based on local conditions,those prices have not been so high as to prevent substantial competition among producers in different States. In the1980's and early 1990's, Massachusetts dairy farmers began
to lose market share to lower cost producers in neighboringStates. In response, the Governor of Massachusetts appointed a Special Commission to study the dairy industry.The commission found that many producers had sold their
dairy farms during the past decade and that if prices paidto farmers for their milk were not significantly increased, a
majority of the remaining farmers in Massachusetts wouldbe "forced out of business within the year." App. 13. On
January 28, 1992, relying on the commission's report, theCommissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Food and
Agriculture (respondent) declared a State of Emergency.

1 The minimum price is a "blend price" that is determined, in part, by
the ultimate use of the raw milk. See 7 CFR $ 1001.1 et seq. (1993). Raw
milk used to produce fluid milk products has the highest price and is characterized in the federal order as "Class I" milk. Milk used for other products, such as eggnog, sour cream, and hard cheese, bears a lower price and
is characterized as "Class II" and "Class III" milk. Each dealer is required to file a monthly report of its raw milk purchases and the use to
which that milk is put. In computing the monthly blend price, the Federal Market Administrator calculates the weighted average price of the
various classes of milk. If Class I milk predominates in the dealer reports, the blend price is high; if other classes predominate, the blend price
is lower. Although all of the farmers are paid the same minimum blend
price regardless of the use to which their milk is put, dealers who sell
more than an average amount of Class I products pay a higher per unit
price than those with relatively lower Class I sales. The federal marketing order thus provides a uniform blend price for sellers of raw milk while
imposing nonuniform payment obligations on the dealers purchasing that
milk. The federal order does not prohibit the payment of prices higher
than the established minima. Like the federal order, the Massachusetts
order requires dealers to make payments into a fund that is disbursed to
farmers on a monthly basis. The assessments, however, are only on Class
I sales and the distributions are only to Massachusetts farmers.

190 WEST LYNN CREAMERY, INC. v. HEALY

Opinion of the Court
In his declaration he noted that the average federal blendprice

2 had declined from $14.67 per hundred pounds (cwt)

of raw milk in 1990 to $12.64/cwt in 1991, while costs of pro-duction for Massachusetts farmers had risen to an estimated

average of $15.50/cwt. Id., at 27. He concluded:

"Regionally, the industry is in serious trouble and ulti-mately, a federal solution will be required. In the

meantime, we must act on the state level to preserveour local industry, maintain reasonable minimum prices
for the dairy farmers, thereby ensure a continuous andadequate supply of fresh milk for our market, and protect the public health." Id., at 31.
Promptly after his declaration of emergency, respondent is-sued the pricing order that is challenged in this proceeding.

3

The order requires every "dealer" 4 in Massachusetts tomake a monthly "premium payment" into the "Massachusetts Dairy Equalization Fund." The amount of those pay-ments is computed in two steps. First, the monthly "order
premium" is determined by subtracting the federal blendprice for that month from $15 and dividing the difference by
three; thus if the federal price is $12/cwt, the order premiumis $1/cwt.

5 Second, the premium is multiplied by the amount

2 For an explanation of the term "blend price," see the previous footnote.
3 The order was first issued on February 18, 1992, and amended on

February 26, 1992. App. 32-40; Brief for Respondent 4-5. Only the
amended order is at issue in this case.

4 A "dealer" is defined as "any person who is engaged within the Commonwealth in the business of receiving, purchasing, pasteurizing, bottling,
processing, distributing, or otherwise handling milk, purchases or receives
milk for sale as the consignee or agent of a producer, and shall include a
producer-dealer, dealer-retailer, and sub-dealer." App. 32-33.

Food and Agriculture, 415 Mass. 8, 11, n. 10, 611 N. E. 2d 239, 241, n. 10
(1993). The commissioner appears to have set the order premium at only
a third of the difference between the federal price and $15 because Massachusetts farmers produce only about one-third of the milk sold as fluid
milk in the State. App. 21. Since Massachusetts dairy farmers produce

(in pounds) of the dealer's Class I 6 sales in Massachusetts.Each month the fund is distributed to Massachusetts producers.7 Each Massachusetts producer receives a share of thetotal fund equal to his proportionate contribution to the
State's total production of raw milk.8Petitioners West Lynn and LeComte's complied with the
pricing order for two months, paying almost $200,000 intothe Massachusetts Dairy Equalization Fund.

Id., at 100,105. Starting in July 1992, however, petitioners refused to

make the premium payments, and respondent commenced li-cense revocation proceedings. Petitioners then filed an action in state court seeking an injunction against enforcementof the order on the ground that it violated the Commerce
Clause of the Federal Constitution. The state court deniedrelief and respondent conditionally revoked their licenses.

The parties agreed to an expedited appellate procedure,and the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts transferred the cases to its own docket. It affirmed, because itconcluded that "the pricing order does not discriminate on its
face, is evenhanded in its application, and only incidentally
one-third of the milk, an assessment of one-third the difference between
$15 and the federal minimum price generates enough revenue to give Massachusetts dairy farmers the entire difference between $15 and the federal
minimum price without leaving any surplus. By paying Massachusetts
dairy farmers the entire difference between $15 and the federal minimum
price, the order premium allows Massachusetts farmers whose cost of production is $15/cwt to sell their milk without loss at the federal minimum
price.

6 For an explanation of the term "Class I," see n. 1, supra.

7 A "producer" is defined as "any person producing milk from dairy

cattle." App. 33.

8 The disbursement is subject to two qualifications. First, any farmer

who produced more than 200,000 pounds of milk is considered to have
produced only 200,000 pounds. Second, no producer may receive payments that make its net price per cwt (including both the federal minimum
price and payments from the Equalization Fund) higher than $15/cwt. If
these limitations lead to a surplus in the Dairy Equalization Fund, the
surplus is returned to the dealers. Id., at 36-38.

burdens interstate commerce." West Lynn Creamery, Inc.v. Commissioner of Dept. of Food and Agriculture, 415

Mass. 8, 15, 611 N. E. 2d 239, 243 (1993). The court notedthat the "pricing order was designed to aid only Massachusetts producers." Id., at 16, 611 N. E. 2d, at 244. It con-ceded that "[c]ommon sense" indicated that the plan has an
"adverse impact on interstate commerce" and that "[t]hefund distribution scheme does burden out-of-State producers." Id., at 17, 611 N. E. 2d, at 244. Nevertheless, thecourt asserted that "the burden is incidental given the purpose and design of the program." Id., at 18, 611 N. E. 2d,at 244. Because it found that the "local benefits" provided
to the Commonwealth's dairy industry "outweigh any inci-dental burden on interstate commerce," it sustained the constitutionality of the pricing order. Id., at 19, 611 N. E. 2d,at 245. We granted certiorari, 510 U. S. 811 (1993), and
now reverse. II

The Commerce Clause vests Congress with ample powerto enact legislation providing for the regulation of prices
paid to farmers for their products. United States v. Darby,312 U. S. 100 (1941); Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942);
Mandeville Island Farms, Inc. v. American Crystal Sugar
Co., 334 U. S. 219 (1948). An affirmative exercise of thatpower led to the promulgation of the federal order setting

minimum milk prices. The Commerce Clause also limitsthe power of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to adopt
regulations that discriminate against interstate commerce."This `negative' aspect of the Commerce Clause prohibits
economic protectionism--that is, regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic interests by burdeningout-of-state competitors. . . . Thus, state statutes that clearly

discriminate against interstate commerce are routinelystruck down . . . unless the discrimination is demonstrably
justified by a valid factor unrelated to economic protection512us1$75I 12-24-97 08:44:30 PAGES OPINPGT

ism . . . ." New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S.
269, 273-274 (1988).9

The paradigmatic example of a law discriminating against
interstate commerce is the protective tariff or customs duty,
which taxes goods imported from other States, but does not
tax similar products produced in State. A tariff is an attractive measure because it simultaneously raises revenue and
benefits local producers by burdening their out-of-state competitors. Nevertheless, it violates the principle of the unitary national market by handicapping out-of-state competitors, thus artificially encouraging in-state production even
when the same goods could be produced at lower cost in
other States.

Because of their distorting effects on the geography of
production, tariffs have long been recognized as violative of
the Commerce Clause. In fact, tariffs against the products
of other States are so patently unconstitutional that our
cases reveal not a single attempt by any State to enact one.
Instead, the cases are filled with state laws that aspire to
reap some of the benefits of tariffs by other means. In
Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U. S. 511 (1935), the
State of New York attempted to protect its dairy farmers
from the adverse effects of Vermont competition by establishing a single minimum price for all milk, whether
produced in New York or elsewhere. This Court did not
hesitate, however, to strike it down. Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Cardozo reasoned:

9 The "negative" aspect of the Commerce Clause was considered the
more important by the "father of the Constitution," James Madison. In
one of his letters, Madison wrote that the Commerce Clause "grew out of
the abuse of the power by the importing States in taxing the nonimporting, and was intended as a negative and preventive provision
against injustice among the States themselves, rather than as a power to
be used for the positive purposes of the General Government." 3 M. Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 478 (1911).

512us1$75I 12-24-97 08:44:30 PAGES OPINPGT
194 WEST LYNN CREAMERY, INC. v. HEALY

Opinion of the Court
"Neither the power to tax nor the police power may beused by the state of destination with the aim and effect

of establishing an economic barrier against competitionwith the products of another state or the labor of its
residents. Restrictions so contrived are an unreason-able clog upon the mobility of commerce. They set up
what is equivalent to a rampart of customs duties de-signed to neutralize advantages belonging to the place
of origin." Id., at 527.
Thus, because the minimum price regulation had the sameeffect as a tariff or customs duty--neutralizing the advantage possessed by lower cost out-of-state producers--it washeld unconstitutional. Similarly, in Bacchus Imports, Ltd.
v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263 (1984), this Court invalidated a lawwhich advantaged local production by granting a tax exemption to certain liquors produced in Hawaii. Other cases ofthis kind are legion.

Welton v. Missouri, 91 U. S. 275 (1876);Guy v. Baltimore, 100 U. S. 434 (1880); Toomer v. Witsell,

334 U. S. 385 (1948); Polar Ice Cream & Creamery Co. v.Andrews, 375 U. S. 361 (1964); Chemical Waste Management,
Inc. v. Hunt, 504 U. S. 334 (1992); see also Hunt v. Washing-ton State Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333, 351
(1977) (invalidating statute, because it "has the effect ofstripping away from the Washington apple industry the competitive and economic advantages it has earned").Under these cases, Massachusetts' pricing order is clearly
unconstitutional. Its avowed purpose and its undisputed ef-fect are to enable higher cost Massachusetts dairy farmers
to compete with lower cost dairy farmers in other States.The "premium payments" are effectively a tax which makes
milk produced out of State more expensive. Although thetax also applies to milk produced in Massachusetts, its effect
on Massachusetts producers is entirely (indeed more than)offset by the subsidy provided exclusively to Massachusetts
dairy farmers. Like an ordinary tariff, the tax is thus effec-tively imposed only on out-of-state products. The pricing

order thus allows Massachusetts dairy farmers who produceat higher cost to sell at or below the price charged by lower

cost out-of-state producers.10 If there were no federal mini-mum prices for milk, out-of-state producers might still be
able to retain their market share by lowering their prices.Nevertheless, out-of-staters' ability to remain competitive by
lowering their prices would not immunize a discriminatorymeasure.

New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S., at275.
11 In this case, because the Federal Government sets

10 A numerical example may make this effect clearer. Suppose the federal minimum price is $12/cwt, that out-of-state producers can sell milk
profitably at that price, but that in-state producers need a price of $15/cwt
in order to break even. Under the pricing order, the tax or "order premium" will be $1/cwt (one-third the difference between the $15/cwt target
price and the $12/cwt federal minimum price). Assuming the tax generates sufficient funds (which will be the case as long as two-thirds of the
milk is produced out of State, which appears to be the case), the Massachusetts farmers will receive a subsidy of $3/cwt. This subsidy will allow
them to lower their prices from $15/cwt to $12/cwt while still breaking
even. Selling at $12/cwt, Massachusetts dairy farmers will now be able
to compete with out-of-state producers. The net effect of the tax and
subsidy, like that of a tariff, is to raise the after-tax price paid by the
dealers. If exactly two-thirds of the milk sold in Massachusetts is
produced out of State, net prices will rise by $1/cwt. If out-of-state farmers produce more than two-thirds of the raw milk, the Dairy Equalization
Fund will have a surplus, which will be refunded to the milk dealers.
This refund will mitigate the price increase, although it will have no effect
on the ability of the program to enable higher cost Massachusetts dairy
farmers to compete with lower cost out-of-staters.

11 In New Energy, 486 U. S., at 275, we noted: "It is true that in [Great

Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Cottrell, 424 U. S. 366 (1976),] and Sporhase
[v. Nebraska ex rel. Douglas, 458 U. S. 941 (1982),] the effect of a State's
refusal to accept the offered reciprocity was total elimination of all transport of the subject product into or out of the offering State; whereas in
the present case the only effect of refusal is that the out-of-state product
is placed at a substantial commercial disadvantage through discriminatory
tax treatment. That makes no difference for purposes of Commerce
Clause analysis. In the leading case of Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc.,
294 U. S. 511 (1935), the New York law excluding out-of-state milk did not
impose an absolute ban, but rather allowed importation and sale so long

minimum prices, out-of-state producers may not even havethe option of reducing prices in order to retain market share.

The Massachusetts pricing order thus will almost certainly"cause local goods to constitute a larger share, and goods
with an out-of-state source to constitute a smaller share, ofthe total sales in the market."

12 Exxon Corp. v. Governor

of Maryland, 437 U. S. 117, 126, n. 16 (1978). In fact, thiseffect was the motive behind the promulgation of the pricing

order. This effect renders the program unconstitutional, be-cause it, like a tariff, "neutraliz[es] advantages belonging to
the place of origin." Baldwin, 294 U. S., at 527.In some ways, the Massachusetts pricing order is most
similar to the law at issue in Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias,468 U. S. 263 (1984). Both involve a broad-based tax on a
single kind of good and special provisions for in-state producas the initial purchase from the dairy farmer was made at or above the
New York State-mandated price. In other words, just as the appellant
here, in order to sell its product in Ohio, only has to cut its profits by
reducing its sales price below the market price sufficiently to compensate
the Ohio purchaser-retailer for the forgone tax credit, so also the milk
wholesaler-distributor in Baldwin, in order to sell its product in New
York, only had to cut its profits by increasing its purchase price above the
market price sufficiently to meet the New York-prescribed premium. We
viewed the New York law as `an economic barrier against competition'
that was `equivalent to a rampart of customs duties.' Id., at 527."

12 That is not to say that the Massachusetts dairy industry may not continue to shrink and that the market share of Massachusetts dairy producers may not continue its fall. It may be the case that Massachusetts producers' costs are so high that, even with the pricing order, many of them
will be unable to compete. Nevertheless, the pricing order will certainly
allow more Massachusetts dairy farmers to remain in business than would
have had the pricing order not been imposed. For Commerce Clause
purposes, it does not matter whether the challenged regulation actually
increases the market share of local producers or whether it merely mitigates a projected decline. See Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S.
263, 272 (1984) ("[W]e perceive no principle of Commerce Clause jurisprudence supporting a distinction between thriving and struggling
enterprises . . ."); Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U. S., at 523.

Opinion of the Court
ers. Bacchus involved a 20% excise tax on all liquor sales,coupled with an exemption for fruit wine manufactured in

Hawaii and for okolehao, a brandy distilled from the root ofa shrub indigenous to Hawaii. The Court held that Hawaii's
law was unconstitutional because it "had both the purposeand effect of discriminating in favor of local products."

Id.,at 273. See also I. M. Darnell & Son Co. v. Memphis, 208

U. S. 113 (1908) (invalidating property tax exemption favor-ing local manufacturers). By granting a tax exemption for
local products, Hawaii in effect created a protective tariff.Goods produced out of State were taxed, but those produced
in State were subject to no net tax. It is obvious that theresult in

Bacchus would have been the same if instead ofexempting certain Hawaiian liquors from tax, Hawaii had

rebated the amount of tax collected from the sale of thoseliquors. See New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S.
269 (1988) (discriminatory tax credit). And if a discrimina-tory tax rebate is unconstitutional, Massachusetts' pricing
order is surely invalid; for Massachusetts not only rebates todomestic milk producers the tax paid on the sale of Massachusetts milk, but also the tax paid on the sale of milkproduced elsewhere.

13 The additional rebate of the tax paid

on the sale of milk produced elsewhere in no way reducesthe danger to the national market posed by tariff-like barriers, but instead exacerbates the danger by giving domesticproducers an additional tool with which to shore up their
competitive position.14

13 Indeed, it is this aspect of the pricing order which allows it to give
Massachusetts farmers a benefit three times as valuable per cwt as the
tax (order premium) imposed. See n. 5, supra.

14 One might attempt to distinguish Bacchus by noting that the rebate

in this case goes not to the entity which pays the tax (milk dealers) but to
the dairy farmers themselves. Rebating the taxes directly to producers
rather than to the dealers, however, merely reinforces the conclusion that
the pricing order will favor local producers. If the taxes were refunded
only to the dealers, there might be no impact on interstate commerce,

Opinion of the Court

III
Respondent advances four arguments against the conclu-sion that its pricing order imposes an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce: (A) Because each component ofthe program--a local subsidy and a nondiscriminatory tax--
is valid, the combination of the two is equally valid; (B) Thedealers who pay the order premiums (the tax) are not competitors of the farmers who receive disbursements from theDairy Equalization Fund, so the pricing order is not discriminatory; (C) The pricing order is not protectionist, becausethe costs of the program are borne only by Massachusetts
dealers and consumers, and the benefits are distributed ex-clusively to Massachusetts farmers; and (D) The order's incidental burden on commerce is justified by the local benefitof saving the dairy industry from collapse. We discuss each
of these arguments in turn.

A
Respondent's principal argument is that, because "themilk order achieves its goals through lawful means," the

order as a whole is constitutional. Brief for Respondent 20.He argues that the payments to Massachusetts dairy farmers
from the Dairy Equalization Fund are valid, because subsid-ies are constitutional exercises of state power, and that the
order premium which provides money for the fund is valid,because it is a nondiscriminatory tax. Therefore the pricing
order is constitutional, because it is merely the combination
of two independently lawful regulations. In effect, respond-ent argues, if the State may impose a valid tax on dealers,

it is free to use the proceeds of the tax as it chooses; and
because the dealers might not use the funds to increase the price or quantity of milk purchased from Massachusetts dairy farmers. The refund to
the dealers might, therefore, result in no advantage to in-state producers.
On the other hand, by refunding moneys directly to the dairy farmers, the
pricing order ensures that Massachusetts producers will benefit.

Opinion of the Court
if it may independently subsidize its farmers, it is free tofinance the subsidy by means of any legitimate tax.

Even granting respondent's assertion that both compo-nents of the pricing order would be constitutional standing
alone,15 the pricing order nevertheless must fall. A puresubsidy funded out of general revenue ordinarily imposes no
burden on interstate commerce, but merely assists local business. The pricing order in this case, however, is fundedprincipally from taxes on the sale of milk produced in other

States.16 By so funding the subsidy, respondent not only as-sists local farmers, but burdens interstate commerce. The
pricing order thus violates the cardinal principle that a Statemay not "benefit in-state economic interests by burdening
out-of-state competitors." New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S., at 273-274; see also Bacchus Imports, Ltd.
v. Dias, 468 U. S., at 272; Guy v. Baltimore, 100 U. S., at 443.

More fundamentally, respondent errs in assuming that the
constitutionality of the pricing order follows logically from
the constitutionality of its component parts. By conjoining

15 We have never squarely confronted the constitutionality of subsidies,
and we need not do so now. We have, however, noted that "[d]irect subsidization of domestic industry does not ordinarily run afoul" of the negative
Commerce Clause. New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 278
(1988); see also Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794, 815
(1976) (Stevens, J., concurring). In addition, it is undisputed that States
may try to attract business by creating an environment conducive to economic activity, as by maintaining good roads, sound public education, or
low taxes. Zobel v. Williams, 457 U. S. 55, 67 (1982) (Brennan, J., concurring); Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S., at 271; Metropolitan Life
Ins. Co. v. Ward, 470 U. S. 869, 876-878 (1985).

16 It is undisputed that an overwhelming majority of the milk sold in

Massachusetts is produced elsewhere. Thus, even though the tax is applied evenhandedly to milk produced in State and out of State, most of the
tax collected comes from taxes on milk from other States. In addition,
the tax on in-state milk, unlike that imposed on out-of-state milk, does not
impose any burden on in-state producers, because in-state dairy farmers
can be confident that the taxes paid on their milk will be returned to them
via the Dairy Equalization Fund.

Opinion of the Court
a tax and a subsidy, Massachusetts has created a program
more dangerous to interstate commerce than either part
alone. Nondiscriminatory measures, like the evenhanded
tax at issue here, are generally upheld, in spite of any adverse effects on interstate commerce, in part because "[t]he
existence of major in-state interests adversely affected . . .
is a powerful safeguard against legislative abuse." Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., 449 U. S. 456, 473, n. 17
(1981); see also Raymond Motor Transp., Inc. v. Rice, 434
U. S. 429, 444, n. 18 (1978) (special deference to state highway
regulations because "their burden usually falls on local economic interests as well as other States' economic interests,
thus insuring that a State's own political processes will serve
as a check against unduly burdensome regulations"); South
Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Brothers, Inc., 303
U. S. 177, 187 (1938); Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U. S. 252, 266
(1989).17 However, when a nondiscriminatory tax is coupled
with a subsidy to one of the groups hurt by the tax, a State's
political processes can no longer be relied upon to prevent
legislative abuse, because one of the in-state interests which
would otherwise lobby against the tax has been mollified by
the subsidy. So, in this case, one would ordinarily have expected at least three groups to lobby against the order premium, which, as a tax, raises the price (and hence lowers
demand) for milk: dairy farmers, milk dealers, and consumers. But because the tax was coupled with a subsidy, one
of the most powerful of these groups, Massachusetts dairy

17 The same principle is recognized in the conceptually similar field of
intergovernmental taxation, where nondiscrimination also plays a central
role in setting the boundary between the permissible and the impermissible. Washington v. United States, 460 U. S. 536, 545 (1983) ("A `political
check' is provided when a state tax falls on a significant group of state
citizens who can be counted upon to use their votes to keep the State from
raising the tax excessively, and thus placing an unfair burden on the Federal Government"); South Carolina v. Baker, 485 U. S. 505, 525-526, n. 15

farmers, instead of exerting their influence against the tax,were in fact its primary supporters.

Respondent's argument would require us to analyze sepa-rately two parts of an integrated regulation, but we cannot

divorce the premium payments from the use to which thepayments are put. It is the entire program--not just the
contributions to the fund or the distributions from that
fund--that simultaneously burdens interstate commerce anddiscriminates in favor of local producers. The choice of

constitutional means--nondiscriminatory tax and local sub-sidy--cannot guarantee the constitutionality of the program
as a whole. New York's minimum price order also used con-stitutional means--a State's power to regulate prices--but
was held unconstitutional because of its deleterious effects.
Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U. S. 511 (1935). Simi-larly, the law held unconstitutional in

Bacchus Imports, Ltd.
v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263 (1984), involved the exercise of Hawaii's
undisputed power to tax and to grant tax exemptions.

Our Commerce Clause jurisprudence is not so rigid as to
be controlled by the form by which a State erects barriers
to commerce. Rather our cases have eschewed formalism
for a sensitive, case-by-case analysis of purposes and effects.
As the Court declared over 50 years ago: "The commerce
clause forbids discrimination, whether forthright or ingenious. In each case it is our duty to determine whether the
statute under attack, whatever its name may be, will in
its practical operation work discrimination against interstate commerce." Best & Co. v. Maxwell, 311 U. S. 454, 455-
456 (1940); Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 756 (1981);

18 As the Governor's Special Commission Relative to the Establishment
of a Dairy Stabilization Fund realized, consumers would be unlikely to
organize effectively to oppose the pricing order. The commission's report
remarked, "the estimated two cent increase per quart of milk would not
be noticed by the consuming public," App. 18, because the price of milk
varies so often and for so many reasons that consumers would be unlikely
to feel the price increases or to attribute them to the pricing order.

Respondent also argues that since the Massachusetts milkdealers who pay the order premiums are not competitors of
the Massachusetts farmers, the pricing order imposes no dis-criminatory burden on commerce. Brief for Respondent 28-
29. This argument cannot withstand scrutiny. Is it possi-ble to doubt that if Massachusetts imposed a higher sales tax
on milk produced in Maine than milk produced in Massachu-setts that the tax would be struck down, in spite of the fact
that the sales tax was imposed on consumers, and consumersdo not compete with dairy farmers? For over 150 years, our
cases have rightly concluded that the imposition of a differ-ential burden on any part of the stream of commerce--from
wholesaler to retailer to consumer--is invalid, because a bur-den placed at any point will result in a disadvantage to the
out-of-state producer. Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419,444, 448 (1827) ("So, a tax on the occupation of an importer
is, in like manner, a tax on importation. It must add to theprice of the article, and be paid by the consumer, or by the

importer himself, in like manner as a direct duty on the arti-cle itself would be made." "The distinction between a tax

on the thing imported, and on the person of the importer,can have no influence on this part of the subject. It is too
obvious for controversy, that they interfere equally with thepower to regulate commerce");

I. M. Darnell & Son Co. v.Memphis, 208 U. S. 113 (1908) (differential burden on intermediate stage manufacturer); Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias,468 U. S. 263 (1984) (differential burden on wholesaler); Webber v. Virginia, 103 U. S. 344, 350 (1881) (differential burdenon sales agent); New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486
U. S., at 273-274 (differential burden on retailer).

C
Respondent also argues that "the operation of the Orderdisproves any claim of protectionism," because

"only in-stateconsumers feel the effect of any retail price increase . . .

[and] [t]he dealers themselves . . . have a substantial in-statepresence." Brief for Respondent 17 (emphasis in original).
This argument, if accepted, would undermine almost everydiscriminatory tax case. State taxes are ordinarily paid by
in-state businesses and consumers, yet if they discriminateagainst out-of-state products, they are unconstitutional.
The idea that a discriminatory tax does not interfere withinterstate commerce "merely because the burden of the tax
was borne by consumers" in the taxing State was thoroughlyrepudiated in Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S., at
272. The cost of a tariff is also borne primarily by localconsumers, yet a tariff is the paradigmatic Commerce
Clause violation.More fundamentally, respondent ignores the fact that
Massachusetts dairy farmers are part of an integrated inter-state market. As noted

supra, at 194-196, the purposeand effect of the pricing order are to divert market share

to Massachusetts dairy farmers. This diversion necessarilyinjures the dairy farmers in neighboring States. Further512us1$75I 12-24-97 08:44:30 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
more, the Massachusetts order regulates a portion of thesame interstate market in milk that is more broadly regulated by a federal milk marketing order which covers most ofNew England. 7 CFR $ 1001.2 (1993). The Massachusetts
producers who deliver milk to dealers in that regulated mar-ket are participants in the same interstate milk market as
the out-of-state producers who sell in the same market andare guaranteed the same minimum blend price by the federal
order. The fact that the Massachusetts order imposes as-sessments only on Massachusetts sales and distributes them
only to Massachusetts producers does not exclude either theassessments or the payments from the interstate market.
To the extent that those assessments affect the relative vol-ume of Class I milk products sold in the marketing area as
compared to other classes of milk products, they necessarilyaffect the blend price payable even to out-of-state producers
who sell only in non-Massachusetts markets.19 The obviousimpact of the order on out-of-state production demonstrates
that it is simply wrong to assume that the pricing order bur-dens only Massachusetts consumers and dealers.

D
Finally, respondent argues that any incidental burden oninterstate commerce "is outweighed by the `local benefits' of

preserving the Massachusetts dairy industry." 20 Brief for

19 On the way changing the demand for Class I milk products changes
the blend price for producers in the entire area covered by the marketing
order, see n. 1, supra.

20 Among the "local benefits" that respondent identifies is "protecting

unique open space and related benefits." Brief for Respondent 40. As
the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court recognized by relegating the
"open space" point to a single footnote, West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Commissioner of Dept. of Food and Agriculture, 415 Mass. 8, 10, n. 6, 611
N. E. 2d 239, 240, n. 6 (1993), the argument that environmental benefits
were central and the enhancement of the market share of Massachusetts
dairy farmers merely "incidental" turns the pricing order on its head. In
addition, even if environmental preservation were the central purpose of

Opinion of the Court
Respondent 42. In a closely related argument, respondenturges that "the purpose of the order, to save an industry

from collapse, is not protectionist." Id., at 16. If we wereto accept these arguments, we would make a virtue of the
vice that the rule against discrimination condemns. Preser-vation of local industry by protecting it from the rigors of
interstate competition is the hallmark of the economic pro-tectionism that the Commerce Clause prohibits. In

Bac-chus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S., at 272, we explicitly

rejected any distinction "between thriving and strugglingenterprises." Whether a State is attempting to " `enhance
thriving and substantial business enterprises' " or to " `subsidize . . . financially troubled' " ones is irrelevant to CommerceClause analysis.

Ibid. With his characteristic eloquence,
Justice Cardozo responded to an argument that respondentechoes today:

"The argument is pressed upon us, however, that theend to be served by the Milk Control Act is something
more than the economic welfare of the farmers or of anyother class or classes. The end to be served is the maintenance of a regular and adequate supply of pure andwholesome milk, the supply being put in jeopardy when

the pricing order, that would not be sufficient to uphold a discriminatory
regulation. See Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 626-627
(1978). Finally, the suggestion that the collapse of the dairy industry endangers open space is not self-evident. Dairy farms are enclosed by
fences, and the decline of farming may well lead to less, rather than more,
intensive land use. As one scholar noted: "Many people assume that . . .
land lost from agriculture is now in urban uses. It is true that some
agricultural land has been urbanized, especially since World War II, but
the major portion of the land moving out of agriculture over the years has
been abandoned to natural forest growth." J. Foster & W. MacConnell,

I
The purpose of the negative Commerce Clause, we haveoften said, is to create a national market. It does not follow

from that, however, and we have never held, that every statelaw which obstructs a national market violates the Commerce Clause. Yet that is what the Court says today. Itseems to have canvassed the entire corpus of negativeCommerce-Clause opinions, culled out every free-marketsnippet of reasoning, and melded them into the sweeping
principle that the Constitution is violated by any state law orregulation that "artificially encourag[es] in-state production
even when the same goods could be produced at lower costin other States." Ante, at 193. See also ante, at 194 (the

law here is unconstitutional because it "neutraliz[es] the ad-vantage possessed by lower cost out-of-state producers");

ante, at 195 (price order is unconstitutional because it allowsin-state producers "who produce at higher cost to sell at or
below the price charged by lower cost out-of-state producers"); ante, at 196 (a state program is unconstitutional whereit " `neutralizes advantages belonging to the place of origin' ") (quoting Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U. S. 511,527 (1935));

ante, at 205 ("Preservation of local industry by
protecting it from the rigors of interstate competition is thehallmark of the economic protectionism that the Commerce

Clause prohibits").

As the Court seems to appreciate by its eagerness expressly to reserve the question of the constitutionality of
subsidies for in-state industry, ante, at 199, and n. 15, this
expansive view of the Commerce Clause calls into question
a wide variety of state laws that have hitherto been thought
permissible. It seems to me that a state subsidy would
clearly be invalid under any formulation of the Court's guiding principle identified above. The Court guardedly asserts
that a "pure subsidy funded out of general revenue ordinarily imposes no burden on interstate commerce, but
merely assists local business," ante, at 199 (emphasis added),
but under its analysis that must be taken to be true only
because most local businesses (e. g., the local hardware store)
are not competing with businesses out of State. The Court
notes that, in funding this subsidy, Massachusetts has taxed
milk produced in other States, and thus "not only assists
local farmers, but burdens interstate commerce." Ibid.
But the same could be said of almost all subsidies funded
from general state revenues, which almost invariably include
moneys from use taxes on out-of-state products. And even
where the funding does not come in any part from taxes on
out-of-state goods, "merely assist[ing]" in-state businesses,
ibid., unquestionably neutralizes advantages possessed by
out-of-state enterprises. Such subsidies, particularly where

they are in the form of cash or (what comes to the samething) tax forgiveness, are often admitted to have as their

purpose--indeed, are nationally advertised as having astheir purpose--making it more profitable to conduct business in State than elsewhere, i. e., distorting normal marketincentives.

The Court's guiding principle also appears to call intoquestion many garden-variety state laws heretofore permissible under the negative Commerce Clause. A state law, forexample, which requires, contrary to the industry practice,
the use of recyclable packaging materials, favors local non-exporting producers, who do not have to establish an additional, separate packaging operation for in-state sales. Ifthe Court's analysis is to be believed, such a law would be
unconstitutional without regard to whether disruption of the"national market" is the real purpose of the restriction, and
without the need to "balance" the importance of the stateinterests thereby pursued, see Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.,
397 U. S. 137 (1970). These results would greatly extend thenegative Commerce Clause beyond its current scope. If the
Court does not intend these consequences, and does not wantto foster needless litigation concerning them, it should not
have adopted its expansive rationale. Another basis fordeciding the case is available, which I proceed to discuss.

Scalia, J., concurring in part and dis-senting in part). Nonetheless, we formally adopted the doctrine of the negative Commerce Clause 121 years ago, seeCase of the State Freight Tax, 15 Wall. 232 (1873), and since
then have decided a vast number of negative-Commerce-Clause cases, engendering considerable reliance interests.

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
As a result, I will, on stare decisis grounds, enforce a self-executing "negative" Commerce Clause in two situations:

(1) against a state law that facially discriminates againstinterstate commerce, and (2) against a state law that is
indistinguishable from a type of law previously held unconstitutional by this Court. See Itel Containers Int'l Corp. v.
Huddleston, 507 U. S. 60, 78-79, and nn. 1, 2 (1993) (Scalia,
J., concurring in judgment) (collecting cases). Applying thisapproach--or at least the second part of it--is not always

easy, since once one gets beyond facial discriminationour negative-Commerce-Clause jurisprudence becomes (and
long has been) a "quagmire." Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450, 458 (1959).
See generally D. Currie, The Constitution in the Supreme
Court: The First Hundred Years 1789-1888, pp. 168-181,
222-236, 330-342, 403-416 (1985). The object should be,
however, to produce a clear rule that honors the holdings
of our past decisions but declines to extend the rationale
that produced those decisions any further. See American
Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266, 305-306
(1987) (Scalia, J., dissenting).

There are at least four possible devices that would enable
a State to produce the economic effect that Massachusetts
has produced here: (1) a discriminatory tax upon the industry, imposing a higher liability on out-of-state members than
on their in-state competitors; (2) a tax upon the industry that
is nondiscriminatory in its assessment, but that has an "exemption" or "credit" for in-state members; (3) a nondiscriminatory tax upon the industry, the revenues from which are
placed into a segregated fund, which fund is disbursed as
"rebates" or "subsidies" to in-state members of the industry
(the situation at issue in this case); and (4) with or without
nondiscriminatory taxation of the industry, a subsidy for the
in-state members of the industry, funded from the State's
general revenues. It is long settled that the first of these
methodologies is unconstitutional under the negative Com512us1$75K 12-24-97 08:44:30 PAGES OPINPGT

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
merce Clause. See, e. g., Guy v. Baltimore, 100 U. S. 434,443 (1880). The second of them, "exemption" from or

"credit" against a "neutral" tax, is no different in principlefrom the first, and has likewise been held invalid. See
Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 756 (1981); Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. Tully, 466 U. S. 388, 399-400, andn. 9 (1984). The fourth methodology, application of a state

subsidy from general revenues, is so far removed from whatwe have hitherto held to be unconstitutional, that prohibiting it must be regarded as an extension of our negative-Commerce-Clause jurisprudence and therefore, to me, unacceptable. See New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486
U. S. 269, 278 (1988). Indeed, in my view our negativeCommerce-Clause cases have already approved the use of
such subsidies. See Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426
U. S. 794, 809-810 (1976).

The issue before us in the present case is whether the
third of these methodologies must fall. Although the question is close, I conclude it would not be a principled point
at which to disembark from the negative-Commerce-Clause
train. The only difference between methodology (2) (discriminatory "exemption" from nondiscriminatory tax) and
methodology (3) (discriminatory refund of nondiscriminatory
tax) is that the money is taken and returned rather than
simply left with the favored in-state taxpayer in the first
place. The difference between (3) and (4), on the other hand,
is the difference between assisting in-state industry through
discriminatory taxation and assisting in-state industry by
other means.

I would therefore allow a State to subsidize its domestic
industry so long as it does so from nondiscriminatory taxes
that go into the State's general revenue fund. Perhaps,
as some commentators contend, that line comports with
an important economic reality: A State is less likely to maintain a subsidy when its citizens perceive that the money (in
the general fund) is available for any number of competing,

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Blackmun joins, dissenting.

The Court is less than just in its description of the reasonswhich lay behind the Massachusetts law which it strikes

down. The law undoubtedly sought to aid struggling Mas-sachusetts dairy farmers, beset by steady or declining prices
and escalating costs. This situation is apparently not uniqueto Massachusetts; New Jersey has filed an amicus brief in
support of respondent because New Jersey has enacted asimilar law. Both States lie in the northeastern metropolitan corridor, which is the most urbanized area in the UnitedStates, and has every prospect of becoming more so. The
value of agricultural land located near metropolitan areas isdriven up by the demand for housing and similar urban uses;
distressed farmers eventually sell out to developers. Notmerely farm produce is lost, as is the milk production in this
case, but, as the Massachusetts Special Commission whosereport was the basis for the order in question here found:

"Without the continued existence of dairy farmers, theCommonwealth will lose its supply of locally produced
fresh milk, together with the open lands that are used as

wildlife refuges, for recreation, hunting, fishing, tourism,and education." App. 13.

Massachusetts has dealt with this problem by providing asubsidy to aid its beleaguered dairy farmers. In case after
case, we have approved the validity under the CommerceClause of such enactments. "No one disputes that a State
may enact laws pursuant to its police powers that have thepurpose and effect of encouraging domestic industry."

Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263, 271 (1984). "Di-rect subsidization of domestic industry does not ordinarily

run afoul of [the dormant Commerce Clause]; discriminatory
taxation of out-of-state manufacturers does." New Energy
Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 278 (1988). But today
the Court relegates these well-established principles to afootnote and, at the same time, gratuitously casts doubt on

the validity of state subsidies, observing that "[w]e havenever squarely confronted" their constitutionality.

Ante, at
199, n. 15.But in

Milk Control Bd. v. Eisenberg Farm Products, 306
U. S. 346 (1939), the Court upheld a Pennsylvania statute establishing minimum prices to be paid to Pennsylvania dairyfarmers against a Commerce Clause challenge by a Pennsylvania milk dealer that shipped all of its milk purchased inPennsylvania to New York to be sold there. The Court observed that "[t]he purpose of the statute . . . is to reach adomestic situation in the interest of the welfare of the producers and consumers of milk in Pennsylvania." Id., at 352.It went on to say:

"One of the commonest forms of state action is the exercise of the police power directed to the control of local
conditions and exerted in the interest of the welfare of
the state's citizens. Every state police statute necessarily will affect interstate commerce in some degree,
but such a statute does not run counter to the grant of
Congressional power merely because it incidentally or

indirectly involves or burdens interstate commerce. . . .These principles have guided judicial decision for more

than a century." Id., at 351-352.
The Massachusetts subsidy under consideration is similarin many respects to the Pennsylvania statute described in

Eisenberg, supra. Massachusetts taxes all dealers of milkwithin its borders. The tax is evenhanded on its face,

i. e.,it affects all dealers regardless of the point of origin of the

milk. Ante, at 194 ("the tax also applies to milk produced inMassachusetts");

ante, at 200 ("the evenhanded tax at issuehere"). The State has not acted to strong-arm sister States

as in Limbach; rather, its motives are purely local. As theSupreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts aptly described it:
"[T]he premiums represent one of the costs of doing businessin the Commonwealth, a cost all milk dealers must pay."
West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Commissioner of Dept. of Food
and Agriculture, 415 Mass. 8, 19, 611 N. E. 2d 239, 245 (1993).Consistent with precedent, the Court observes: "A pure

subsidy funded out of general revenue ordinarily imposes noburden on interstate commerce, but merely assists local business." Ante, at 199. And the Court correctly recognizesthat "[n]ondiscriminatory measures, like the evenhanded tax
at issue here, are generally upheld" due to the deference nor-mally accorded to a State's political process in passing legislation in light of various competing interest groups. Ante,at 200, citing

Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., 449U. S. 456, 473, n. 17 (1981), and Raymond Motor Transp.,

Inc. v. Rice, 434 U. S. 429, 444, n. 18 (1978). But the Courtstrikes down this method of state subsidization because the
nondiscriminatory tax levied against all milk dealers is cou-pled with a subsidy to milk

producers. Ante, at 200-201.The Court does this because of its view that the method of

imposing the tax and subsidy distorts the State's politicalprocess: The dairy farmers, who would otherwise lobby
against the tax, have been mollified by the subsidy. Ibid.But as the Court itself points out, there are still at least two

strong interest groups opposed to the milk order--consum-ers and milk dealers. More importantly, nothing in the

dormant Commerce Clause suggests that the fate of stateregulation should turn upon the particular lawful manner in
which the state subsidy is enacted or promulgated. Analysis of interest group participation in the political processmay serve many useful purposes, but serving as a basis for

interpreting the dormant Commerce Clause is not one ofthem.

The Court concludes that the combined effect of the milkorder "simultaneously burdens interstate commerce and
discriminates in favor of local producers." Ante, at 201. In
support of this conclusion, the Court cites Baldwin v. G. A. F.
Seelig, Inc., 294 U. S. 511 (1935), and Bacchus Imports, Ltd.
v. Dias, supra, as two examples in which constitutional
means were held to have unconstitutional effects on interstate commerce. But both Baldwin and Bacchus are a far
cry from this case.

In Baldwin, supra, in order to sell bottled milk in New
York, milk dealers were required to pay a minimum price
for milk, even though they could have purchased milk from
Vermont farmers at a lower price. This scheme was found
to be an effort to prevent Vermont milk producers from
selling to New York dealers at their lower market price.
As Justice Cardozo explained, under the New York statute,
"the importer . . . may keep his milk or drink it, but sell it he
may not." 294 U. S., at 521. Such a scheme clearly made it
less attractive for New York dealers to purchase milk from
Vermont farmers, for the disputed law negated any economic
advantage in so doing. Under the Massachusetts milk
order, there is no such adverse effect. Milk dealers have
the same incentives to purchase lower priced milk from outof-state farmers; dealers of all milk are taxed equally. To
borrow Justice Cardozo's description, milk dealers in Massachusetts are free to keep their milk, drink their milk, and
sell it--on equal terms as local milk.

216 WEST LYNN CREAMERY, INC. v. HEALY

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
In Bacchus, the State of Hawaii combined its undisputedpower to tax and grant exemptions in a manner that the

Court found violative of the Commerce Clause. There, theState exempted a local wine from the burdens of an excise
tax levied on all other liquor sales. Despite the Court'sstrained attempt to compare the scheme in

Bacchus to themilk order in this case, ante, at 196-197, it is clear that the

milk order does not produce the same effect on interstatecommerce as the tax exemption in Bacchus. I agree with
the Court's statement that Bacchus can be distinguished "bynoting that the rebate in this case goes not to the entity
which pays the tax (milk dealers) but to the dairy farmersthemselves."

Ante, at 197, n. 14. This is not only a distinc-tion, but a significant difference. No decided case supports

the Court's conclusion that the negative Commerce Clauseprohibits the State from using money that it has lawfully
obtained through a neutral tax on milk dealers and distribut-ing it as a subsidy to dairy farmers. Indeed, the case which
comes closest to supporting the result the Court reaches isthe ill-starred opinion in

United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1(1936), in which the Court held unconstitutional what would

have been an otherwise valid tax on the processing of ag-ricultural products because of the use to which the revenue
raised by the tax was put.More than half a century ago, Justice Brandeis said in his
dissenting opinion in New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285
U. S. 262, 311 (1932):

"To stay experimentation in things social and eco-nomic is a grave responsibility. Denial of the right to

experiment may be fraught with serious consequences
to the Nation. It is one of the happy incidents of thefederal system that a single courageous State may, if its

citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel so-cial and economic experiments without risk to the rest
of the country."

Justice Brandeis' statement has been cited more than oncein subsequent majority opinions of the Court. See, e. g.,

Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429, 441 (1980). His observa-tion bears heeding today, as it did when he made it. The
wisdom of a messianic insistence on a grim sink-or-swim pol-icy of laissez-faire economics would be debatable had Congress chosen to enact it; but Congress has done nothing ofthe kind. It is the Court which has imposed the policy
under the dormant Commerce Clause, a policy which bodesill for the values of federalism which have long animated our
constitutional jurisprudence.

MCI TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORP. v. AMERICANTELEPHONE & TELEGRAPH CO.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 93-356. Argued March 21, 1994--Decided June 17, 1994*
Title 47 U. S. C. $ 203(a) requires communications common carriers to file

tariffs with the Federal Communications Commission, and $ 203(b)(2)
authorizes the Commission to "modify any requirement made by or
under . . . this section . . . ." Relying on the latter provision, the Commission issued an order determining that its earlier decision to make
tariff filing optional for all nondominant long-distance carriers was
within its authority to "modify." American Telephone and Telegraph
Co., the only dominant long-distance carrier, filed a motion with the
Court of Appeals seeking summary reversal of the Commission's order.
The motion was granted on the basis of that court's prior decision determining that the Commission's authorization of permissive detariffing
violated $ 203(a).

Held: The Commission's permissive detariffing policy is not a valid exercise of its $ 203(b)(2) authority to "modify any requirement." Because
virtually every dictionary in use now and at the time the statute was
enacted defines "to modify" as meaning to change moderately or in
minor fashion, the word "modify" must be seen to have a connotation of
increment or limitation. That $ 203(b)(2) does not contemplate basic or
fundamental changes is also demonstrated by the fact that the only exception to it deals with a very minor matter: The Commission may not
require the period for giving notice of tariff changes to exceed 120 days.
The Commission's permissive detariffing policy cannot be justified as
a nonfundamental "modification." The tariff filing requirement is the
heart of the common carrier subchapter of the Communications Act of
1934, and the policy eliminates that requirement entirely for all except
one firm in the long-distance sector, and for 40% of all consumers in that
sector. Moreover, it is hard to imagine that a condition shared by so
many affected parties qualifies as "special" under $ 203(b)(2)'s requirement that when the Commission proceeds "by general order" to make
a modification, the order can only apply "to special circumstances or
conditions." The Commission's interpretation of the statute is there*Together with No. 93-521, United States et al. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co. et al., also on certiorari to the same court.

fore not entitled to deference, since it goes beyond the meaning that

TELEPHONE & TELEGRAPH CO.

Opinion of the Court

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
Section 203(a) of Title 47 of the United States Code re-quires communications common carriers to file tariffs with

the Federal Communications Commission, and $ 203(b)authorizes the Commission to "modify" any requirement
of $ 203. These cases present the question whether theCommission's decision to make tariff filing optional for all
nondominant long-distance carriers is a valid exercise of itsmodification authority.

I
Like most cases involving the role of the American Tele-phone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) in our national telecommunication system, these have a long history. An un-derstanding of the cases requires a brief review of the
Commission's efforts to regulate and then deregulate thetelecommunications industry. When Congress created the
Commission in 1934, AT&T, through its vertically integratedBell system, held a virtual monopoly over the Nation's telephone service. The Communications Act of 1934, 48 Stat.1064, as amended, authorized the Commission to regulate the
rates charged for communication services to ensure that theywere reasonable and nondiscriminatory. The requirements
of $ 203 that common carriers file their rates with the Com-mission and charge only the filed rate were the centerpiece
of the Act's regulatory scheme.In the 1970's, technological advances reduced the entry
costs for competitors of AT&T in the market for long-distance telephone service. The Commission, recognizing
the feasibility of greater competition, passed regulations tofacilitate competitive entry. By 1979, competition in the
provision of long-distance service was well established, andsome urged that the continuation of extensive tariff filing requirements served only to impose unnecessary costson new entrants and to facilitate collusive pricing. The
Commission held hearings on the matter, see CompetitiveCarrier Notice of Inquiry and Proposed Rulemaking, 77

F. C. C. 2d 308 (1979), following which it issued a series ofrules that have produced this litigation.

The First Report and Order, 85 F. C. C. 2d 1, 20-24 (1980),distinguished between dominant carriers (those with market
power) and nondominant carriers--in the long-distance mar-ket, this amounted to a distinction between AT&T and everyone else--and relaxed some of the filing procedures for non-dominant carriers,

id., at 30-49. In the Second Report andOrder, 91 F. C. C. 2d 59 (1982), the Commission entirely eliminated the filing requirement for resellers of terrestrial com-mon carrier services. This policy of optional filing, or permissive detariffing, was extended to all other resellers, andto specialized common carriers, including petitioner MCI
Telecommunications Corp., by the Fourth Report and Order,95 F. C. C. 2d 554 (1983),

1 and to virtually all remaining categories of nondominant carriers by the Fifth Report and
Order, 98 F. C. C. 2d 1191 (1984). Then, in 1985, the Com-mission shifted to a mandatory detariffing policy, which prohibited nondominant carriers from filing tariffs. See SixthReport and Order, 99 F. C. C. 2d 1020. The United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, how-ever, struck down the Sixth Report's mandatory detariffing
policy in a challenge brought--somewhat ironically as it nowappears--by MCI. See MCI Telecommunications Corp. v.
F. C. C., 765 F. 2d 1186 (1985) (Ginsburg, J.). The Court ofAppeals reasoned that $ 203(a)'s command that "[e]very common carrier . . . shall . . . file" tariffs was mandatory. Andalthough $ 203(b) authorizes the Commission to "modify any
requirement" in the section, the Court of Appeals concludedthat that phrase "suggest[ed] circumscribed alterations--not,
as the FCC now would have it, wholesale abandonment orelimination of a requirement."

222 MCI TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORP. v. AMERICAN

TELEPHONE & TELEGRAPH CO.

Opinion of the Court

In the wake of the invalidation of mandatory detariffingby the Court of Appeals, MCI continued its practice of not

filing tariffs for certain services, pursuant to the permissivedetariffing policy of the

Fourth Report and Order. On August 7, 1989, AT&T filed a complaint, pursuant to the thirdparty complaint provision of the Communications Act, 47U. S. C. $ 208(a), which alleged that MCI's collection of unfiled rates violated $$ 203(a) and (c). MCI responded thatthe

Fourth Report was a substantive rule, and so MCI had
no legal obligation to file rates. AT&T rejoined that the
Fourth Report and Order was simply a statement of the
Commission's nonenforcement policy, which did not immunize MCI from private enforcement actions; and that if the
Fourth Report and Order established a substantive rule, it
was in excess of statutory authority. The Commission did
not take final action on AT&T's complaint until almost 21/2
years after its filing. See AT&T Communications v. MCI
Telecommunications Corp., 7 FCC Rcd 807 (1992). It characterized the Fourth Report and Order as a substantive rule
and dismissed AT&T's complaint on the ground that MCI
was in compliance with that rule. It refused to address,
however, AT&T's contention that the rule was ultra vires,
announcing instead a proposed rulemaking to consider that
question. See Tariff Filing Requirements for Interstate
Common Carriers, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 7 FCC
Rcd 804 (1992).

AT&T petitioned for review, arguing, inter alia, that the
Commission lacked authority to defer to a later rulemaking
consideration of an issue which was dispositive of an adjudicatory complaint. The United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit granted the petition for review. See American Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. F. C. C.,
978 F. 2d 727 (1992) (Silberman, J.). The Court of Appeals
characterized the Commission's failure to address its authority to promulgate the permissive detariffing policy as "a sort
of administrative law shell game," id., at 731-732. Address512us1$76K 12-24-97 08:48:10 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ing that question itself, the Court of Appeals concluded thatthe permissive detariffing policy of the

Fourth Report and
Order was rendered indefensible by the 1985 MCI decision:"Whether detariffing is made mandatory, as in the

Sixth Report, or simply permissive, as in the Fourth Report, carriers
are, in either event, relieved of the obligation to file tariffsunder section 203(a). That step exceeds the limited authority granted the Commission in section 203(b) to `modify' re-quirements of the Act."

Id., at 736. The Court of Appeals
then remanded the case so that the Commission could awardappropriate relief. See

id., at 736-737. We denied certiorari. MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 509 U. S. 913 (1993).

Moving now with admirable dispatch, less than two weeks
after the decision by the Court of Appeals concerning the
adjudicatory proceeding, the Commission released a Report
and Order from the rulemaking proceeding commenced in
response to AT&T's complaint. See In re Tariff Filing Requirements for Interstate Common Carriers, 7 FCC Rcd
8072 (1992), stayed pending further notice, 7 FCC Rcd 7989
(1992). That is the Report and Order at issue in this case.
The Commission, relying upon the $ 203(b) authority to
"modify" that had by then been twice rejected by the District of Columbia Circuit, determined that its permissive
detariffing policy was within its authority under the Communications Act. AT&T filed a motion with the District of Columbia Circuit seeking summary reversal of the Commission's order. The motion was granted in an unpublished per

Opinion of the Court

II
Section 203 of the Communications Act contains both the
filed rate provisions of the Act and the Commission's dis-puted modification authority. It provides in relevant part:

"(a) Filing; public display.

"Every common carrier, except connecting carriers,
shall, within such reasonable time as the Commissionshall designate, file with the Commission and print and

keep open for public inspection schedules showing allcharges . . . , whether such charges are joint or separate,
and showing the classifications, practices, and regula-tions affecting such charges. . . .
"(b) Changes in schedule; discretion of Commission tomodify requirements.

"(1) No change shall be made in the charges, classifications, regulations, or practices which have been sofiled and published except after one hundred and twenty

days notice to the Commission and to the public, whichshall be published in such form and contain such information as the Commission may by regulations prescribe."(2) The Commission may, in its discretion and for
good cause shown, modify any requirement made by orunder the authority of this section either in particular
instances or by general order applicable to special circumstances or conditions except that the Commissionmay not require the notice period specified in paragraph

(1) to be more than one hundred and twenty days.
"(c) Overcharges and rebates.

"No carrier, unless otherwise provided by or under
authority of this chapter, shall engage or participate in
such communication unless schedules have been filed
and published in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter and with the regulations made thereunder; and
no carrier shall (1) charge, demand, collect, or receive a

Opinion of the Court
greater or less or different compensation for such communication . . . than the charges specified in the schedule
then in effect, or (2) refund or remit by any means or
device any portion of the charges so specified, or (3) extend to any person any privileges or facilities in such
communication, or employ or enforce any classifications,
regulations, or practices affecting such charges, except
as specified in such schedule." 47 U. S. C. $ 203 (1988
ed. and Supp. IV).

The dispute between the parties turns on the meaning of
the phrase "modify any requirement" in $ 203(b)(2). Petitioners argue that it gives the Commission authority to make
even basic and fundamental changes in the scheme created
by that section. We disagree. The word "modify"--like a
number of other English words employing the root "mod-"
(deriving from the Latin word for "measure"), such as "moderate," "modulate," "modest," and "modicum"--has a connotation of increment or limitation. Virtually every dictionary
we are aware of says that "to modify" means to change moderately or in minor fashion. See, e. g., Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1236 (2d ed. 1987) ("to
change somewhat the form or qualities of; alter partially;
amend"); Webster's Third New International Dictionary
1452 (1981) ("to make minor changes in the form or structure
of: alter without transforming"); 9 Oxford English Dictionary 952 (2d ed. 1989) ("[t]o make partial changes in; to change
(an object) in respect of some of its qualities; to alter or vary
without radical transformation"); Black's Law Dictionary
1004 (6th ed. 1990) ("[t]o alter; to change in incidental or subordinate features; enlarge; extend; amend; limit; reduce").

In support of their position, petitioners cite dictionary
definitions contained in, or derived from, a single source,
Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1452 (1981)
(Webster's Third), which includes among the meanings of

Opinion of the Court

"modify," "to make a basic or important change in." 2 Peti-tioners contend that this establishes sufficient ambiguity to

entitle the Commission to deference in its acceptance ofthe broader meaning, which in turn requires approval of its
permissive detariffing policy. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837,843 (1984). In short, they contend that the courts must

defer to the agency's choice among available dictionary defi-nitions, citing National Railroad Passenger Corporation v.
Boston & Maine Corp., 503 U. S. 407, 418 (1992).But Boston & Maine does not stand for that proposition.
That case involved the question whether the statutory term"required" could only mean "demanded as essential" or could
also mean "demanded as appropriate." In holding that thelatter was a permissible interpretation, to which

Chevrondeference was owed, the opinion did not rely exclusively

upon dictionary definitions, but also upon contextual indica-tions, see 503 U. S., at 417-419--which in the present cases,
as we shall see, contradict petitioners' position. Moreover,when the

Boston & Maine opinion spoke of "alternative dic-tionary definitions," ibid., it did not refer to what we have

here: one dictionary whose suggested meaning contradictsvirtually all others. It referred to alternative definitions

2 Petitioners also cite Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 763
(1991), which includes among its definitions of "modify," "to make basic or
fundamental changes in often to give a new orientation to or to serve a
new end." They might also have cited the eighth version of Webster's
New Collegiate Dictionary 739 (1973), which contains that same definition;
and Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary 544 (1963), which contains the same definition as Webster's Third New International Dictionary
quoted in text. The Webster's New Collegiate Dictionaries, published by
G. & C. Merriam Company of Springfield, Massachusetts, are essentially
abridgments of that company's Webster's New International Dictionaries,
and recite that they are based upon those lengthier works. The last New
Collegiate to be based upon Webster's Second New International, rather
than Webster's Third, does not include "basic or fundamental change"
among the accepted meanings of "modify." See Webster's New Collegiate
Dictionary 541 (6th ed. 1949).

Opinion of the Court
within the dictionary cited (Webster's Third, as it happens),which was not represented to be the

only dictionary giving
those alternatives. To the contrary, the Court said "thesealternative interpretations are as old as the jurisprudence of

this Court," id., at 419, citing McCulloch v. Maryland, 4
Wheat. 316 (1819). See also Webster's New InternationalDictionary 2117 (2d ed. 1934); 2 New Shorter Oxford English

Dictionary 2557 (1993) (giving both alternatives).Most cases of verbal ambiguity in statutes involve, as

Boston & Maine did, a selection between accepted alternativemeanings shown as such by many dictionaries. One can envision (though a court case does not immediately come to
mind) having to choose between accepted alternative meanings, one of which is so newly accepted that it has only been
recorded by a single lexicographer. (Some dictionary must
have been the very first to record the widespread use of
"projection," for example, to mean "forecast.") But what
petitioners demand that we accept as creating an ambiguity
here is a rarity even rarer than that: a meaning set forth in
a single dictionary (and, as we say, its progeny) which not
only supplements the meaning contained in all other dictionaries, but contradicts one of the meanings contained in virtually all other dictionaries. Indeed, contradicts one of the
alternative meanings contained in the out-of-step dictionary
itself--for as we have observed, Webster's Third itself defines "modify" to connote both (specifically) major change
and (specifically) minor change. It is hard to see how that
can be. When the word "modify" has come to mean both "to
change in some respects" and "to change fundamentally" it
will in fact mean neither of those things. It will simply
mean "to change," and some adverb will have to be called
into service to indicate the great or small degree of the
change.

If that is what the peculiar Webster's Third definition
means to suggest has happened--and what petitioners suggest by appealing to Webster's Third--we simply disagree.

Opinion of the Court

"Modify," in our view, connotes moderate change. It mightbe good English to say that the French Revolution "modified" the status of the French nobility--but only becausethere is a figure of speech called understatement and a literary device known as sarcasm. And it might be unsurprisingto discover a 1972 White House press release saying that
"the Administration is modifying its position with regard toprosecution of the war in Vietnam"--but only because press
agents tend to impart what is nowadays called "spin." Suchintentional distortions, or simply careless or ignorant misuse,
must have formed the basis for the usage that Webster'sThird, and Webster's Third alone, reported.

3 It is perhaps

gilding the lily to add this: In 1934, when the Communica-tions Act became law--the most relevant time for determining a statutory term's meaning, see Perrin v. United States,444 U. S. 37, 42-45 (1979)--Webster's Third was not yet even
contemplated. To our knowledge all English dictionariesprovided the narrow definition of "modify," including those
published by G. & C. Merriam Company. See Webster'sNew International Dictionary 1577 (2d ed. 1934); Webster's
Collegiate Dictionary 628 (4th ed. 1934). We have not theslightest doubt that is the meaning the statute intended.

Beyond the word itself, a further indication that the$ 203(b)(2) authority to "modify" does not contemplate fundamental changes is the sole exception to that authority which

3 That is not an unlikely hypothesis. Upon its long-awaited appearance
in 1961, Webster's Third was widely criticized for its portrayal of common
error as proper usage. See, e. g., Follett, Sabotage in Springfield, 209 Atlantic 73 (Jan. 1962); Barzun, What is a Dictionary? 32 The American
Scholar 176, 181 (spring 1963); Macdonald, The String Unwound, 38 The
New Yorker 130, 156-157 (Mar. 1962). An example is its approval (without qualification) of the use of "infer" to mean "imply": "infer" "5: to give
reason to draw an inference concerning: HINT (did not take part in the
debate except to ask a question inferring that the constitution must be
changed--Manchester Guardian Weekly)." Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1158 (1961).

Opinion of the Court
the section provides. One of the requirements of $ 203 is
that changes to filed tariffs can be made only after 120 days'
notice to the Commission and the public. $ 203(b)(1). The
only exception to the Commission's $ 203(b)(2) modification
authority is as follows: "except that the Commission may not
require the notice period specified in paragraph (1) to be
more than one hundred and twenty days." Is it conceivable
that the statute is indifferent to the Commission's power to
eliminate the tariff-filing requirement entirely for all except
one firm in the long-distance sector, and yet strains out the
gnat of extending the waiting period for tariff revision beyond 120 days? We think not. The exception is not as ridiculous as a Lilliputian in London only because it is to be
found in Lilliput: in the small-scale world of "modifications,"
it is a big deal.

Since an agency's interpretation of a statute is not entitled
to deference when it goes beyond the meaning that the statute can bear, see, e. g., Pittston Coal Group v. Sebben, 488
U. S. 105, 113 (1988); Chevron, 467 U. S., at 842-843, the
Commission's permissive detariffing policy can be justified
only if it makes a less than radical or fundamental change in
the Act's tariff-filing requirement. The Commission's attempt to establish that no more than that is involved greatly
understates the extent to which its policy deviates from the
filing requirement, and greatly undervalues the importance
of the filing requirement itself.

To consider the latter point first: For the body of a law, as
for the body of a person, whether a change is minor or major
depends to some extent upon the importance of the item
changed to the whole. Loss of an entire toenail is insignificant; loss of an entire arm tragic. The tariff-filing requirement is, to pursue this analogy, the heart of the commoncarrier section of the Communications Act. In the context
of the Interstate Commerce Act, which served as its model,
see, e. g., MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. FCC, 917 F. 2d

30, 38 (CADC 1990), this Court has repeatedly stressed that
rate filing was Congress's chosen means of preventing unreasonableness and discrimination in charges: "[T]here is not
only a relation, but an indissoluble unity between the provision for the establishment and maintenance of rates until corrected in accordance with the statute and the prohibitions
against preferences and discrimination." Texas & Pacific
R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204 U. S. 426, 440 (1907);
see also Robinson v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 222 U. S. 506,
508-509 (1912). "The duty to file rates with the Commission, [the analog to $ 203(a)], and the obligation to charge
only those rates, [the analog to $ 203(c)], have always been
considered essential to preventing price discrimination and
stabilizing rates." Maislin Industries, U. S., Inc. v. Primary Steel, Inc., 497 U. S. 116, 126 (1990); see also Arizona
Grocery Co. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 284 U. S. 370, 384
(1932) (filing requirements "render rates definite and certain,
and . . . prevent discrimination and other abuses"); Armour
Packing Co. v. United States, 209 U. S. 56, 81 (1908) (elimination of filing requirement "opens the door to the possibility
of the very abuses of unequal rates which it was the design of
the statute to prohibit and punish"). As the Maislin Court
concluded, compliance with these provisions "is `utterly central' to the administration of the Act." 497 U. S., at 132,

208, 406, would not be susceptible of effective enforcement ifrates were not publicly filed.

4 See Maislin, supra, at 132.

Rate filings are, in fact, the essential characteristic of a rate-regulated industry. It is highly unlikely that Congress

would leave the determination of whether an industry willbe entirely, or even substantially, rate-regulated to agency
discretion--and even more unlikely that it would achievethat through such a subtle device as permission to "modify"
rate-filing requirements.Bearing in mind, then, the enormous importance to the
statutory scheme of the tariff-filing provision, we turn towhether what has occurred here can be considered a mere
"modification." The Commission stresses that its detariff-ing policy applies only to nondominant carriers, so that the
rates charged to over half of all consumers in the long-distance market are on file with the Commission. It is not
clear to us that the proportion of customers affected, ratherthan the proportion of carriers affected, is the proper measure of the extent of the exemption (of course all carriers inthe long-distance market are exempted, except AT&T). But
even assuming it is, we think an elimination of the crucialprovision of the statute for 40% of a major sector of the industry is much too extensive to be considered a "modifica-tion." What we have here, in reality, is a fundamental revision of the statute, changing it from a scheme of rateregulation in long-distance common-carrier communications

4 The dissent misrepresents what we say in this sentence, see post, at
242, and addresses two paragraphs to an argument we have not made,
post, at 242-244. We simply say, as did the Maislin Court, that eliminating the tariff-filing requirement would frustrate complaint proceedings;
not that eliminating those requirements, or indeed even eliminating the
complaint proceedings, would frustrate the ultimate purposes of the Act.
Perhaps, as the dissent asserts, it would not; perhaps even eliminating the
FCC would not do so. But we (and the FCC) are bound, not only by the
ultimate purposes Congress has selected, but by the means it has deemed
appropriate, and prescribed, for the pursuit of those purposes.

Opinion of the Court

to a scheme of rate regulation only where effective competi-tion does not exist. That may be a good idea, but it was not

the idea Congress enacted into law in 1934.Apart from its failure to qualify as a "modification," there
is an independent reason why the Commission's detariffing
policy cannot come within the $ 203(b)(2) authority to modify.That provision requires that when the Commission proceeds

"by general order" (as opposed to when it acts "in particularinstances") to make a modification, the order can only apply
"to special circumstances or conditions." Although that is asomewhat elastic phrase, it is not infinitely so. It is hard to
imagine that a condition shared by 40% of all long-distancecustomers, and by all long-distance carriers except one, qualifies as "special" within the intent of this limitation.5Both sides of this dispute contend that Congress has manifested in later legislation agreement with their respectiveinterpretations of the Communications Act. Petitioners
point to the 1990 amendment of the Act to require operator
service providers (OSP's) to file informational tariffs, whichcan be phased out after four years, see Telephone Operator

Consumer Services Improvement Act of 1990 (TOCSIA), 104Stat. 990, 47 U. S. C. $ 226(h) (1988 ed., Supp. IV). Petitioners reason that this must envision a background of permis-sive filing, since otherwise the permitted phaseout of infor5 The dissent suggests that we ignore $ 203(c) of the Act, which prohibits
carriers from providing service in the absence of a filed rate "unless provided by or under the authority of this Act." The dissent asserts that
that phrase must refer to the modification authority of $ 203(b)(2). See
post, at 239-240. Perhaps it does so--though that would not at all contradict our interpretation of $ 203(b)(2), which we have acknowledged, see
infra, at 234, might in some limited circumstances permit the Commission
to waive the filing requirement. But $ 203(c) could just as (in fact, more)
easily be read as referring to $ 203(a)'s express exemption of connecting
carriers, $$ 201(b) and 211's authorization of services between carriers pursuant to contractual rates, $ 332(c)(1)(A)'s exemptions for mobile carriers,
and other express statutory exemptions from filing requirements.

Opinion of the Court
mational tariffs would be a phase-in of even more rigorous
requirements. AT&T, on the other hand, claims that Congress has manifested agreement with its position in the recent amendment of 47 U. S. C. $ 332(c)(1)(A) that gives the
Commission authority to limit the tariff-filing requirement
for commercial mobile carriers--authority that would be unnecessary if the Commission's view of $ 203 is correct. At
most, these conflicting arguments indicate that Congress was
aware of the decade-long tug of war between the Commission
and the District of Columbia Circuit over the authority to
relax filing requirements, and at different times proceeded
on different assumptions as to who would win. We have
here not a consistent history of legislation to which one or
the other, interpretation of the Act is essential; but rather
two pieces of legislation to which first one, and then the
other, interpretation of the Act is more congenial. That is
not enough to change anything.

Finally, petitioners earnestly urge that their interpretation of $ 203(b) furthers the Communications Act's broad purpose of promoting efficient telephone service. They claim
that although the filing requirement prevented price discrimination and unfair practices while AT&T maintained a monopoly over long-distance service, it frustrates those same
goals now that there is greater competition in that market.
Specifically, they contend that filing costs raise artificial barriers to entry and that the publication of rates facilitates
parallel pricing and stifles price competition. We have considerable sympathy with these arguments (though we doubt
it makes sense, if one is concerned about the use of filed
tariffs to communicate pricing information, to require filing
by the dominant carrier, the firm most likely to be a price
leader). The Court itself has policed trade associations and
rate bureaus under the antitrust laws precisely because the
sharing of pricing information can facilitate price fixing, see,
e. g., Sugar Institute, Inc. v. United States, 297 U. S. 553

(1936); American Column & Lumber Co. v. United States,257 U. S. 377 (1921), and the Court has protected regulated

firms from some types of antitrust suits brought on the basisof their filed rates, see,

e. g., Square D Co. v. Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc., 476 U. S. 409 (1986). As we noted
earlier this Term, there is considerable "debate in other fo-rums about the wisdom of the filed rate doctrine,"

Security
Services, Inc. v. Kmart Corp., 511 U. S. 431, 440 (1994), and,more broadly, about the value of continued regulation of the

telecommunications industry. But our estimations, and theCommission's estimations, of desirable policy cannot alter the
meaning of the federal Communications Act of 1934. Forbetter or worse, the Act establishes a rate-regulation, filedtariff system for common-carrier communications, and the
Commission's desire "to `increase competition' cannot provide [it] authority to alter the well-established statutory filed
rate requirements," Maislin, 497 U. S., at 135. As we observed in the context of a dispute over the filed-rate doctrine
more than 80 years ago, "such considerations address themselves to Congress, not to the courts," Armour Packing, 209
U. S., at 82.

We do not mean to suggest that the tariff-filing requirement is so inviolate that the Commission's existing modification authority does not reach it at all. Certainly the
Commission can modify the form, contents, and location of
required filings, and can defer filing or perhaps even waive
it altogether in limited circumstances. But what we have
here goes well beyond that. It is effectively the introduction of a whole new regime of regulation (or of free-market
competition), which may well be a better regime but is not
the one that Congress established.

The communications industry has an unusually dynamic
character. In 1934, Congress authorized the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) to regulate
"a field of enterprise the dominant characteristic of which
was the rapid pace of its unfolding." National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U. S. 190, 219 (1943). The Communications Act of 1934 (Act) gives the FCC unusually broad
discretion to meet new and unanticipated problems in order
to fulfill its sweeping mandate "to make available, so far
as possible, to all the people of the United States, a rapid,
efficient, Nation-wide and world-wide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable
charges." 47 U. S. C. $ 151. This Court's consistent interpretation of the Act has afforded the Commission ample leeway to interpret and apply its statutory powers and responsibilities. See, e. g., United States v. Southwestern Cable
Co., 392 U. S. 157, 172-173 (1968); FCC v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U. S. 134, 138 (1940). The Court today abandons that approach in favor of a rigid literalism that deprives
the FCC of the flexibility Congress meant it to have in order
to implement the core policies of the Act in rapidly changing conditions.

At the time the Act was passed, the telephone industry
was dominated by the American Telephone & Telegraph
Company (AT&T) and its affiliates. Title II of the Act,
which establishes the framework for FCC regulation of common carriers by wire, was clearly a response to that dominance. As the Senate Report explained, "[u]nder existing

The wire communications provisions of the Act addressproblems distinctly associated with monopoly. Section 201

requires telephone carriers to "furnish . . . communicationservice upon reasonable request therefor," and mandates
that their "charges, practices, classifications, and regulations" be "just and reasonable." 47 U. S. C. $ 201. Section202 forbids carriers to "make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations,facilities, or services . . . or give any undue or unreasonable
preference or advantage to any particular person, class ofpersons, or locality." 47 U. S. C. $ 202(a). The Commission,
upon complaint or its own motion, may hold hearings upon,
and declare the lawfulness of, proposed rate increases, $ 204,and may prescribe just and reasonable charges upon a finding that a carrier's actual or proposed charges are illegal,

Congress doubtless viewed the filed rate provisions as animportant mechanism to guard against abusive practices
by wire communications monopolies. But it is quite wrongto suggest that the mere process of filing rate schedules--rather than the substantive duty of reasonably pricedand nondiscriminatory service--is "the heart of the
common-carrier section of the Communications Act." Ante,at 229.

II
In response to new conditions in the communications in-dustry, including stirrings of competition in the long-distance

telephone market, the FCC in 1979 began re-examining itsregulatory scheme. The Commission tentatively concluded
that costly tariff-filing requirements were unnecessary andactually counterproductive as applied to nondominant carriers, i. e., those whose lack of market power leaves themunable to extract supracompetitive or discriminatory rates
from customers. See Competitive Carrier Rulemaking, 77F. C. C. 2d 308 (1979). Relaxing the regulatory burdens
upon new entrants would foster competition into the tele512us1$76I 12-24-97 08:48:11 PAGES OPINPGT

communications markets; at the same time, the forces of competition would ensure that firms without monopoly power
would comply with the Act's prohibitions on "unreasonable
rates" and price discrimination. See id., at 334-338. As
the Commission explained in 1981, tariff-filing obligations for
nondominant firms were simultaneously "superfluous as a
consumer protection device, since competition circumscribes
the prices and practices of these companies" and inimical to
"price competition and service and marketing innovation."
Deregulation of Telecommunications Services, 84 F. C. C. 2d
445, 478-479 (1981). Accordingly, in a series of rulings in
the early 1980's, the Commission issued orders progressively
exempting specified classes of nondominant carriers from the
obligation to file tariff schedules. See, e. g., Second Report
and Order, 91 F. C. C. 2d 59 (1982); Third Report and Order,
48 Fed. Reg. 46791 (1983). The Commission's Fourth Report
and Order, 95 F. C. C. 2d 554 (1983), extended and reaffirmed
its "permissive detariffing" policy, under which dominant
long-distance carriers must file tariff schedules whereas nondominant carriers, although subject to the Act's prohibitions
on unreasonable rates and price discrimination, may, but
need not, file them.

In the instant In re Tariff Filing Requirements for Interstate Common Carriers, 7 FCC Rcd 8072 (1992), the FCC
adhered to its policy of excusing nondominant providers of
long-distance telephone service from the $ 203 filing requirement, and codified that longstanding forbearance policy.
The Commission reaffirmed its commitment to "adapt . . .
regulation of telecommunications common carriers to the
changed circumstances of competition and to develop a regulatory approach that furthers the purposes of the Act while
fostering innovation and the efficient development of the
telecommunications industry," id., at 8079, and explained
once again why, in its view, permissive detariffing furthered
these goals, id., at 8079-8080. As it had since its initial

stages of detariffing, see 84 F. C. C. 2d, at 479-480, the Commission found principal statutory authority for detariffing in
the "modify any requirement" language of $ 203(b)(2). 7
FCC Rcd, at 8074-8075. "[A]ctual experience under permissive detariffing," including an increase in the number of
long-distance carriers from 12 in 1982 to 482 a decade later,
"further confirm[ed] the success of [the FCC's] approach in
furthering the statutory goals of the Communications Act."
Id., at 8079-8080.

III

Although the majority observes that further relaxation of
tariff-filing requirements might more effectively enhance
competition, ante, at 233-234, it does not take issue with the
Commission's conclusions that mandatory filing of tariff
schedules serves no useful purpose and is actually counterproductive in the case of carriers who lack market power.
As the Commission had noted in its prior detariffing orders,
see, e. g., 84 F. C. C. 2d, at 479-480, if a nondominant carrier
sought to charge inflated rates, "customers would simply
move to other carriers." 7 FCC Rcd, at 8079. Moreover,
an absence of market power will ordinarily preclude firms of
any kind from engaging in price discrimination. See, e. g.,
L. Sullivan, Law of Antitrust 89 (1977) ("A firm will not discriminate unless it has market power"); 9 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law || 1711a, pp. 119-120 (1991). The Commission
plausibly concluded that any slight enforcement benefits a
tariff-filing requirement might offer were outweighed by the
burdens it would put on new entrants and consumers. Thus,
the sole question for us is whether the FCC's policy, however
sensible, is nonetheless inconsistent with the Act.

In my view, each of the Commission's detariffing orders
was squarely within its power to "modify any requirement"
of $ 203. Section 203(b)(2) plainly confers at least some discretion to modify the general rule that carriers file tariffs,

512us1$76I 12-24-97 08:48:11 PAGES OPINPGT
240 MCI TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORP. v. AMERICAN

TELEPHONE & TELEGRAPH CO.

Stevens, J., dissenting

for it speaks of "any requirement." 2 Section 203(c) of theAct, ignored by the Court, squarely supports the FCC's position; it prohibits carriers from providing service without atariff "unless otherwise provided by or under authority of
this Act." Section 203(b)(2) is plainly one provision that"otherwise provides," and thereby authorizes, service without a filed schedule. The FCC's authority to modify $ 203'srequirements in "particular instances" or by "general order
applicable to special circumstances or conditions" emphasizesthe expansive character of the Commission's authority: modifications may be narrow or broad, depending upon the Com-mission's appraisal of current conditions. From the vantage
of a Congress seeking to regulate an almost completely mo-nopolized industry, the advent of competition is surely a
"special circumstance or condition" that might legitimatelycall for different regulatory treatment.

The only statutory exception to the Commission's modifi-cation authority provides that it may not extend the 120-day
notice period set out in $ 203(b)(1). See $ 203(b)(2). TheAct thus imposes a specific limit on the Commission's authority to stiffen that regulatory imposition on carriers, but doesnot confine the Commission's authority to

relax it. It wasno stretch for the FCC to draw from this single, unidirectional statutory limitation on its modification authority theinference that its authority is otherwise unlimited. See 7
FCC Rcd, at 8075.According to the Court, the term "modify," as explicated
in all but the most unreliable dictionaries, ante, at 225-228,and n. 3, rules out the Commission's claimed authority to
relieve nondominant carriers of the basic obligation to filetariffs. Dictionaries can be useful aides in statutory interpretation, but they are no substitute for close analysis ofwhat words mean as used in a particular statutory context.

2 Section 203(b)(2) must do more than merely allow the Commission to
dictate the form and contents of tariff filings, for $ 203(b)(1) separately
grants it that authority.

Cf. Cabell v. Markham, 148 F. 2d 737, 739 (CA2 1945) (Hand,J.). Even if the sole possible meaning of "modify" were to

make "minor" changes, ante, at 225,3 further elaboration isneeded to show why the detariffing policy should fail. The
Commission came to its present policy through a series ofrulings that gradually relaxed the filing requirements for
nondominant carriers. Whether the current policy shouldcount as a cataclysmic or merely an incremental departure
from the $ 203(a) baseline depends on whether one focuseson particular carriers' obligations to file (in which case the
Commission's policy arguably works a major shift) 4 or on thestatutory policies behind the tariff-filing requirement (which
remain satisfied because market constraints on nondominantcarriers obviate the need for rate filing). When $ 203 is
viewed as part of a statute whose aim is to constrain monopoly power, the Commission's decision to exempt nondominant
carriers is a rational and "measured" adjustment to novelcircumstances--one that remains faithful to the core purpose

of the tariff-filing section. See Black's Law Dictionary 1198(3d ed. 1933) (defining "modification" as "A change; an alteration which introduces new elements into the details, or can-cels some of them, but leaves

the general purpose and effect
of the subject-matter intact").The Court seizes upon a particular sense of the word

"modify" at the expense of another, long-established meaning

3 As petitioner MCI points out, the revolutionary consent decree providing for the breakup of the Bell System was, per AT&T's own proposal,
entitled "Modification of Final Judgment." See United States v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 552 F. Supp. 131 (D. C. 1982), aff'd, 460
U. S. 1001 (1983).

4 Because the statute imposes no limit on the Commission's authority to

shorten the interval between filing a tariff and bringing it into effect, and
because there is no sign that anyone actually pays attention to tariffs
filed by nondominant carriers, the additional step of eliminating the filing
requirement is less important than the Court would have it. Even the
Court appears to recognize that the Commission could sometimes excuse
carriers from filing tariffs. See ante, at 234.

that fully supports the Commission's position. That word isfirst defined in Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 628 (4th ed.

1934) as meaning "to limit or reduce in extent or degree." 5The Commission's permissive detariffing policy fits comfortably within this common understanding of the term. TheFCC has in effect adopted a general rule stating that "if you
are dominant you must file, but if you are nondominant youneed not." The Commission's partial detariffing policy--
which excuses nondominant carriers from filing on condition
that they remain nondominant--is simply a relaxation of acostly regulatory requirement that recent developments had

rendered pointless and counterproductive in a certain classof cases.

A modification pursuant to $ 203(b)(1), like any other orderissued under the Act, must of course be consistent with the
purposes of the statute. On this point, the Court assertsthat the Act's prohibition against unreasonable and discriminatory rates "would not be susceptible of effective enforce-ment if rates were not publicly filed."

the first instance. But the Commission has repeatedly ex5 See also 9 Oxford English Dictionary 952 (2d ed. 1989) ("2. To alter in

plained that (1) a carrier that lacks market power is entirelyunlikely to charge unreasonable or discriminatory rates, (2)

the statutory bans on unreasonable charges and price dis-crimination apply with full force regardless of whether carriers have to file tariffs, (3) any suspected violations by nondominant carriers can be addressed on the Commission's ownmotion or on a damages complaint filed pursuant to $ 206,

6

and (4) the FCC can reimpose a tariff requirement shouldviolations occur. See,

e. g., 7 FCC Rcd, at 8078-8079. The
Court does not adequately respond to the FCC's explana-tions, and gives no reason whatsoever to doubt the Commission's considered judgment that tariff filing is altogether un-necessary in the case of competitive carriers, see,

e. g., id., at
8073, 8079; the majority's ineffective enforcement argumentlacks any evidentiary or historical support.

The Court's argument is also demonstrably incorrect. A
contemporary cousin of the Communications Act of 1934--
the Robinson-Patman Price Discrimination Act, 15 U. S. C.

$$ 13(a), 13a, 13b, enacted in 1936--contains a much broader
prohibition against price discrimination than does the Communications Act. That statute has performed its mission for
almost 60 years without any counterpart to the filed rate
doctrine. Indeed, the substantive requirements of Title II
of the Communications Act itself apply to "connecting carriers" even though $ 203(a) exempts such carriers from the

$ 203 tariff-filing provisions. See 47 U. S. C. $ 152(b); National Assn. of Regulatory Utility Commr's v. F. C. C., 737

not the only means for aggrieved telephone customers to recover. Section
206 allows them to recover damages from carriers who have violated the
Act and does not turn on the existence of a tariff. See also $$ 208, 415(b).

existed in 1979 now represents about 40% of the market; thisgrowth has occurred while the detariffing policy has been in

effect without any indication that the absence of filed sched-ules has produced discriminatory or unreasonable pricing
by nondominant carriers. Extolling the "enormous impor-tance" of filed rates,

ante, at 231, and resorting to dictionarydefinitions and colorful metaphors are unsatisfactory substitutes for a reasoned explanation of why the statute requiresrate filing even when the practice serves no useful purpose
and actually harms consumers.The filed tariff provisions of the Communications Act are
not ends in themselves, but are merely one of several proce-dural

means for the Commission to ensure that carriers donot charge unreasonable or discriminatory rates. See 84

F. C. C. 2d, at 483. The Commission has reasonably con-cluded that this particular means of enforcing the statute's
substantive mandates will prove counterproductive in thecase of nondominant long-distance carriers. Even if the
1934 Congress did not define the scope of the Commission's
modification authority with perfect scholarly precision, thisis surely a paradigm case for judicial deference to the

agency's interpretation, particularly in a statutory regimeso obviously meant to maximize administrative flexibility.

7

Whatever the best reading of $ 203(b)(2), the Commission's
reading cannot in my view be termed unreasonable. It is

7 The majority considers it unlikely that Congress would have conferred
power on the Commission to exempt carriers from the supposedly pivotal
rate-filing obligation. See ante, at 231-232. But surely such a delegation
is not out of place in a statute that also empowers the FCC, for example,
to decide what the "public convenience, interest, or necessity" requires,
see, e. g., 47 U. S. C. $ 303, and to "prescribe such rules and regulations as
may be necessary in the public interest," $ 201(b); see also $ 154(i). The
Court's rigid reading of $ 202(b)(2) is out of step with our prior recognition
that the 1934 Act was meant to be a "supple instrument for the exercise
of discretion by the expert body which Congress has charged to carry out
its legislative policy." FCC v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U. S. 134,
138 (1940).

informed (as ours is not) by a practical understanding of therole (or lack thereof) that filed tariffs play in the modern

regulatory climate and in the telecommunications industry.Since 1979, the FCC has sought to adapt measures originally
designed to control monopoly power to new market condi-tions. It has carefully and consistently explained that mandatory tariff-filing rules frustrate the core statutory interestin rate reasonableness. The Commission's use of the "discretion" expressly conferred by $ 203(b)(2) reflects "a reason-able accommodation of manifestly competing interests and
is entitled to deference: the regulatory scheme is technicaland complex, the agency considered the matter in a detailed
and reasoned fashion, and the decision involves reconcil-ing conflicting policies." Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural
Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 865 (1984)(footnotes omitted). The FCC has permissibly interpreted
its $ 203(b)(2) authority in service of the goals Congressset forth in the Act. We should sustain its eminently
sound, experience-tested, and uncommonly well-explainedjudgment.

HAWAIIAN AIRLINES, INC. v. NORRIS
certiorari to the supreme court of hawaii
No. 92-2058. Argued April 28, 1994--Decided June 20, 1994*
Respondent Norris was terminated from his job as an aircraft mechanic

by petitioner Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. (HAL), after refusing to sign a
maintenance record, as required by his collective-bargaining agreement
(CBA), for a plane he considered unsafe, and reporting his concerns
to the Federal Aviation Administration. In separate state-court suits
against HAL and its officers, also petitioners, he alleged, inter alia,
that he had been wrongfully discharged in violation of the public policy
expressed in the Federal Aviation Act and implementing regulations
and in violation of Hawaii's Whistleblower Protection Act. The court
dismissed these tort claims as pre-empted by the Railway Labor Act's
(RLA's) mandatory arbitral mechanism for so-called "minor" disputes,
which grow "out of grievances or out of the interpretation and application of agreements concerning [pay rates], rules, or working conditions,"
45 U. S. C. $ 153 First (i). The State Supreme Court reversed, concluding that $ 153 First (i)'s plain language does not support pre-emption of
disputes independent of a labor agreement, and interpreting the opinion
in Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn.,
491 U. S. 299, to limit RLA pre-emption to disputes involving contractually defined rights. The court rejected petitioners' argument that the
claims were pre-empted because resort to the CBA was necessary to
determine whether Norris was discharged for insubordination, pointing
to Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic Chef, Inc., 486 U. S. 399, in which this
Court held that the Labor-Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA),
pre-empts state law only if a state-law claim is dependent on the interpretation of a CBA, and that purely factual questions about an employee's conduct and the employer's conduct and motives do not require
interpreting such an agreement's terms.

Held: The RLA does not pre-empt Norris' state-law causes of action.

Pp. 252-266.

(a) The minor disputes contemplated by the RLA are those that are
grounded in a CBA. See, e. g., Consolidated Rail Corporation, 491
U. S., at 305. The RLA pre-emption standard for resolving such disputes that has emerged from the relevant cases, see, e. g., Atchison, T. &
S. F. R. Co. v. Buell, 480 U. S. 557, is that a state-law cause of action

is not pre-empted if it involves rights and obligations that exist independent of the CBA. This standard is virtually identical to the preemption standard employed in cases involving $ 301 of the LMRA.
Given the convergence of the two standards, Lingle provides an appropriate framework for addressing RLA pre-emption, and its standard--
that the existence of a potential CBA-based remedy does not deprive
an employee of independent remedies available under state law--is
adopted to resolve such claims. Elgin, J. & E. R. Co. v. Burley, 325
U. S. 711; Consolidated Rail Corporation, 491 U. S., at 302, distinguished. Pp. 252-266.

(b) Under Lingle, Norris' state-law claims are independent of the
CBA. Petitioners' argument that resort to the CBA is necessary to
determine whether Norris was discharged for cause is foreclosed by
Lingle's teaching that the issue whether an employer's actions make out
the element of discharge under state law is a purely factual question.
Similarly, Norris' failure to sign the maintenance record is not relevant
to the determination of his state-law tort claims. P. 266.

return it to service after he has made, supervised, or in-spected certain repairs performed on that plane. See Certification: Airmen Other Than Flight Crewmembers, 14 CFR$$ 65.85 and 65.87 (1987). If he were to approve any aircraft
on which the repairs did not conform to FAA safety reg-ulations, the FAA could suspend or revoke his license.
See Maintenance, Preventive Maintenance, Rebuilding andAlteration, 14 CFR $ 43.12 (1992).

On February 2, 1987, respondent was hired by petitionerHawaiian Airlines, Inc. (HAL). Many of the terms of his
employment were governed by a collective-bargaining agree-ment (CBA) negotiated between the carrier and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.Under the CBA, respondent's duties included inspecting and
repairing all parts of a plane and its engine. On July 15,1987, during a routine preflight inspection of a DC-9 plane,
he noticed that one of the tires was worn. When he re-moved the wheel, respondent discovered that the axle sleeve,
which should have been mirror smooth, was scarred andgrooved. This damaged sleeve could cause the landing gear
to fail. Respondent recommended that the sleeve be re-placed, but his supervisor ordered that it be sanded and returned to the plane. This was done, and the plane flew asscheduled. At the end of the shift, respondent refused to
sign the maintenance record to certify that the repair hadbeen performed satisfactorily and that the airplane was fit
to fly. See 14 CFR $ 43.9(a) (1992). The supervisor im-mediately suspended him pending a termination hearing.
Respondent immediately went home and called the FAAto report the problem with the sleeve.

Respondent then invoked the grievance procedure out-lined in the CBA, and a "Step 1" grievance hearing was held

1 In response, the FAA initiated a comprehensive investigation, proposed a civil penalty of $964,000 against HAL, proposed the revocation of
the license of the supervisor who terminated respondent, and ultimately
settled all charges for a substantial fine.

250 HAWAIIAN AIRLINES, INC. v. NORRIS

Opinion of the Court
on July 31, 1987. Petitioner HAL accused respondent of
insubordination, claiming that his refusal to sign the record
violated the CBA's provision that an aircraft mechanic "may
be required to sign work records in connection with the work
he performs." Respondent relied on the CBA's guarantees
that an employee may not be discharged without just cause
and may not be disciplined for refusing to perform work that
is in violation of health or safety laws. The hearing officer
terminated respondent for insubordination.

Still conforming to the CBA procedures, respondent appealed his termination, seeking a "Step 3" grievance hearing. Before this hearing took place, HAL offered to reduce
respondent's punishment to suspension without pay, but
warned him that "any further instance of failure to perform
[his] duties in a responsible manner" could result in discharge. Respondent did not respond to this offer, nor, apparently, did he take further steps to pursue his grievance
through the CBA procedures.

On December 18, 1987, respondent filed suit against HAL
in Hawaii Circuit Court. His complaint included two
wrongful-discharge torts--discharge in violation of the

RLA, and remanded the other claims to the state trial court.The trial court then dismissed respondent's claim of discharge in violation of public policy, holding that it, too, waspre-empted by the RLA's provision of exclusive arbitral procedures. The state court certified its order as final to per-mit respondent to take an immediate appeal.

In the meantime, respondent had filed a second lawsuit instate court, naming as defendants three of HAL's officers
who allegedly directed, confirmed, or ratified the claimedretaliatory discharge.

3 He again sought relief for, among

other things, discharge in violation of public policy and ofthe Hawaii Whistleblower Protection Act. The Hawaii trial

court dismissed these two counts as pre-empted by the RLAand certified the case for immediate appeal.

The Supreme Court of Hawaii reversed in both cases, con-cluding that the RLA did not pre-empt respondent's state
tort actions. Norris v. Hawaiian Airlines, Inc., 74 Haw.235, 842 P. 2d 634 (1992); 74 Haw. 648, 847 P. 2d 263 (1993).
That court concluded that the plain language of $ 153 First(i) does not support pre-emption of disputes independent of
a labor agreement, 74 Haw., at 251, 842 P. 2d, at 642, andinterpreted the opinion in Consolidated Rail Corporation v.
Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 491 U. S. 299 (1989) (Conrail), to limit RLA pre-emption to "disputes involving con-tractually defined rights." 74 Haw., at 250, 842 P. 2d, at 642.

The court rejected petitioners' argument that the retaliatorydischarge claims were pre-empted because determining
whether HAL discharged respondent for insubordination,and thus for just cause, required construing the CBA. The
court pointed to Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic Chef, Inc.,486 U. S. 399 (1988), a case involving $ 301 of the LaborManagement Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), 29 U. S. C. $ 185,in which the Court held that a claim of wrongful termination

did not require interpretation of a CBA, but depended upon
purely factual questions concerning the employee's conduct

A

Whether federal law pre-empts a state law establishing a
cause of action is a question of congressional intent. See
Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U. S. 202, 208 (1985).
Pre-emption of employment standards "within the traditional police power of the State" "should not be lightly
inferred." Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U. S.
1, 21 (1987); see also Hillsborough County v. Automated
Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 715 (1985) (a
federal statute will be read to supersede a State's historic
powers only if this is " `the clear and manifest purpose
of Congress' ").

Congress' purpose in passing the RLA was to promote
stability in labor-management relations by providing a comprehensive framework for resolving labor disputes. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Buell, 480 U. S. 557, 562 (1987); see
also 45 U. S. C. $ 151a. To realize this goal, the RLA establishes a mandatory arbitral mechanism for "the prompt and
orderly settlement" of two classes of disputes. 45 U. S. C.

$ 151a. The first class, those concerning "rates of pay, rules
or working conditions," ibid., are deemed "major" disputes.
Major disputes relate to " `the formation of collective [bargaining] agreements or efforts to secure them.' " Conrail,
491 U. S., at 302, quoting Elgin, J. & E. R. Co. v. Burley, 325
U. S. 711, 723 (1945). The second class of disputes, known
as "minor" disputes, "gro[w] out of grievances or out of the
interpretation or application of agreements covering rates

Opinion of the Court
of pay, rules, or working conditions." 45 U. S. C. $ 151a.Minor disputes involve "controversies over the meaning of

an existing collective bargaining agreement in a particularfact situation." Trainmen v. Chicago R. & I. R. Co., 353
U. S. 30, 33 (1957). Thus, "major disputes seek to createcontractual rights, minor disputes to enforce them."

Con-rail, 491 U. S., at 302, citing Burley, 325 U. S., at 723.

Petitioners contend that the conflict over respondent'sfiring is a minor dispute. If so, it must be resolved only
through the RLA mechanisms, including the carrier's inter-nal dispute-resolution processes and an adjustment board established by the employer and the unions. See 45 U. S. C.$ 184;

Buell, 480 U. S., at 563; Conrail, 491 U. S., at 302.Thus, a determination that respondent's complaints constitute a minor dispute would pre-empt his state-law actions.

B
The Court's inquiry into the scope of minor disputes be-gins, of course, with the text of the statute. Petitioners

point out that the statute defines minor disputes to include"disputes . . . growing out of grievances,

or out of the in-terpretation or application of [CBA's]." Petitioners argue

that this disjunctive language must indicate that "griev-ances" means something other than labor-contract disputes,
else the term "grievances" would be superfluous. Accord-ingly, petitioners suggest that "grievances" should be read
to mean all employment-related disputes, including thosebased on statutory or common law. Even if we were persuaded that the word "or" carried this weight, but cf. United
States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 732 (1993) (reading "error ordefect" to create one category of "error"), citing

UnitedStates v. Young, 470 U. S. 1, 15, n. 12 (1985); McNally v.

United States, 483 U. S. 350, 358-359 (1987) (second phrasein disjunctive added simply to make the meaning of the first
phrase "unmistakable"), petitioners' interpretation producesan overlap not unlike the one it purports to avoid. Their

512us2$77F 01-08-98 12:21:28 PAGES OPINPGT
254 HAWAIIAN AIRLINES, INC. v. NORRIS

Opinion of the Court
expansive definition of "grievances" necessarily encompasses
disputes growing out of "the interpretation or application"
of CBA's. Thus, in attempting to save the term "grievances" from superfluity, petitioners would make the phrase
after the "or" mere surplusage.

We think it more likely that "grievances," like disputes
over "the interpretation or application" of CBA's, refers to
disagreements over how to give effect to the bargained-for
agreement. The use of "grievance" to refer to a claim arising out of a CBA is common in the labor-law context in general, see, e. g., Paperworkers v. Misco, Inc., 484 U. S. 29, 36
(1987), and it has been understood in this way in the RLA
context. See H. R. Rep. No. 1944, 73d Cong., 2d Sess.,
2-3 (1934) (referring to RLA settlement of "minor disputes
known as `grievances,' which develop from the interpretation
and/or application of the contracts between the labor unions
and the carriers"). Significantly, the adjustment boards
charged with administration of the minor-dispute provisions
have understood these provisions as pertaining only to disputes invoking contract-based rights. See, e. g., NRAB
Fourth Div. Award No. 4548 (1987) (function of the National
Rail Adjustment Board (Board) is to decide disputes in
accordance with the controlling CBA); NRAB Third Div.
Award No. 24348 (1983) (issues not related to the interpretation or application of contracts are outside the Board's
authority); NRAB Third Div. Award No. 19790 (1973)
("[T]his Board lacks jurisdiction to enforce rights created
by State or Federal Statutes and is limited to questions arising out of interpretations and application of Railway Labor
Agreements"); Northwest Airlines/Airline Pilots Assn.,
Int'l System Bd. of Adjustment, Decision of June 28, 1972,
p. 13 ("[B]oth the traditional role of the arbitrator and admonitions of the courts require the Board to refrain from attempting to construe any of the provisions of the [RLA]");
United Airlines, Inc., 48 LA 727, 733 (BNA) (1967) ("The

Opinion of the Court
jurisdiction of this System Board does not extend to inter-preting and applying the Civil Rights Act").

Accordingly, we believe that the most natural reading ofthe term "grievances" in this context is as a synonym for disputes involving the application or interpretation of a CBA.
See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1585
(1986) (the word "or" may be used to indicate "the synonymous, equivalent, or substitutive character of two words or
phrases"). Nothing in the legislative history of the RLA 4 or
other sections of the statute 5 undermines this conclusion.
But even accepting that $ 151a is susceptible of more than one
interpretation, no proposed interpretation demonstrates a
clear and manifest congressional purpose to create a regime

4 During the debates surrounding the RLA's enactment in 1926, floor
statements that, in isolation, could support a broader interpretation of
"grievances" were counterbalanced by other statements--some even by
the same legislators--that equated grievances with contract interpretation. Compare 67 Cong. Rec. 4517, 8807 (1926), with id., at 4510, 8808.
This inconclusive debate hardly calls for fashioning a broad rule of preemption. Moreover, in 1934 when Congress amended the RLA to make
arbitration mandatory for minor disputes, the accompanying House Report stated that the bill was intended "to provide sufficient and effective
means for the settlement of minor disputes known as `grievances,' which
develop from the interpretation and/or application of the contracts between the labor unions and the carriers, fixing wages and working conditions." H. R. Rep. No. 1944, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 2-3 (1934).

5 Petitioners cite the statute's reference to the parties' general duties as

including "settl[ing] all disputes, whether arising out of the application of
[collective bargaining] agreements or otherwise." 45 U. S. C. $ 152 First.
This provision, which is phrased more broadly than the operative language
of $ 153 First (i), does not clearly refer only to minor disputes. But even
if this provision is read to require parties to try to settle certain issues
arising out of the employment relationship but not specifically addressed
by the CBA, this does not compel the conclusion that all issues touching
on the employment relationship must be resolved through arbitration
or that all claims involving rights and duties that exist independent of
the CBA are thereby pre-empted. Our precedents squarely reject this
pervasive pre-emption.

Opinion of the Court
that broadly pre-empts substantive protections extended bythe States, independent of any negotiated labor agreement.

C
Our case law confirms that the category of minor disputescontemplated by $ 151a are those that are grounded in the

CBA. We have defined minor disputes as those involvingthe interpretation or application of existing labor agreements. See, e. g., Conrail, 491 U. S., at 305 ("The distin-guishing feature of [a minor dispute] is that the dispute
may be conclusively resolved by interpreting the existing[CBA]");

Pittsburgh & Lake Erie R. Co. v. Railway LaborExecutives' Assn., 491 U. S. 490, 496, n. 4 (1989) ("Minor disputes are those involving the interpretation or applicationof existing contracts"); Trainmen, 353 U. S., at 33 (minor disputes are "controversies over the meaning of an existing col-lective bargaining agreement");

Slocum v. Delaware, L. & W.R. Co., 339 U. S. 239, 243 (1950) (RLA arbitral mechanism

is meant to provide remedies for "adjustment of railroad-employee disputes growing out of the interpretation of existing agreements").Moreover, we have held that the RLA's mechanism for
resolving minor disputes does not pre-empt causes of actionto enforce rights that are independent of the CBA. More
than 60 years ago, the Court rejected a railroad's argumentthat the existence of the RLA arbitration scheme preempted a state statute regulating the number of workersrequired to operate certain equipment.

Missouri Pacific R.Co. v. Norwood, 283 U. S. 249, 258 (1931) ("No analysis or

discussion of the provisions of the Railway Labor Act of 1926is necessary to show that it does not conflict with the Arkansas statutes under consideration"). Not long thereafter, theCourt rejected a claim that the RLA pre-empted an order by
the Illinois Commerce Commission requiring cabooses on alltrains; the operative CBA required cabooses only on some of
the trains. Terminal Railroad Assn. of St. Louis v. Train512us2$77F 01-08-98 12:21:28 PAGES OPINPGT

257Cite as: 512 U. S. 246 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
men, 318 U. S. 1 (1943). Although the Court assumed that
a railroad adjustment board would have jurisdiction under
the RLA over this dispute, id., at 6, it concluded that the
state law was enforceable nonetheless:

"State laws have long regulated a great variety of conditions in transportation and industry, such as sanitary
facilities and conditions, safety devices and protections,
purity of water supply, fire protection, and innumerable
others. Any of these matters might, we suppose, be the
subject of a demand by work[ers] for better protection
and upon refusal might be the subject of a labor dispute
which would have such effect on interstate commerce
that federal agencies might be invoked to deal with some
phase of it. . . . But it cannot be said that the minimum
requirements laid down by state authority are all set
aside. We hold that the enactment by Congress of the
[RLA] was not a preemption of the field of regulating
working conditions themselves . . . ." Id., at 6-7.

Thus, under Norwood, substantive protections provided by
state law, independent of whatever labor agreement might
govern, are not pre-empted under the RLA.

Although Norwood and Terminal Railroad involved state
workplace safety laws, the Court has taken a consistent approach in the context of state actions for wrongful discharge.
In Andrews v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 406 U. S. 320
(1972), the Court held that a state-law claim of wrongful
termination was pre-empted, not because the RLA broadly
pre-empts state-law claims based on discharge or discipline,
but because the employee's claim was firmly rooted in a
breach of the CBA itself. He asserted no right independent
of that agreement:

"Here it is conceded by all that the only source of [Andrews'] right not to be discharged, and therefore to treat
an alleged discharge as a `wrongful' one that entitles him

512us2$77F 01-08-98 12:21:28 PAGES OPINPGT
258 HAWAIIAN AIRLINES, INC. v. NORRIS

Opinion of the Court
to damages, is the [CBA]. . . . [T]he disagreement turnson the extent of [the railroad's] obligation to restore [Andrews] to his regular duties following injury in an auto-mobile accident. The existence and extent of such an
obligation in a case such as this will depend on the interpretation of the [CBA]. Thus [Andrews'] claim, and[the railroad's] disallowance of it, stem from differing

interpretations of the [CBA]. . . . His claim is there-fore subject to the Act's requirement that it be submitted to the Board for adjustment." Id., at 324 (empha-sis added).

Here, in contrast, the CBA is not the "only source" of re-spondent's right not to be discharged wrongfully. In fact,
the "only source" of the right respondent asserts in this ac-tion is state tort law. Wholly apart from any provision of
the CBA, petitioners had a state-law obligation not to firerespondent in violation of public policy or in retaliation for
whistle-blowing. The parties' obligation under the RLA toarbitrate disputes arising out of the application or interpretation of the CBA did not relieve petitioners of this duty.

Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Buell, 480 U. S. 557 (1987),confirms that "minor disputes" subject to RLA arbitration

are those that involve duties and rights created or definedby the CBA. In

Buell, a railroad employee sought damages
for workplace injuries under the Federal Employers' Liabil-ity Act (FELA), 45 U. S. C. $ 51

et seq., which provides a
remedy for a railroad worker injured through an employer'sor co-worker's negligence. The railroad argued that, because the alleged injury resulted from conduct that was subject to the CBA, the employee's sole remedy was through
RLA arbitration. The Court unanimously rejected this argument, emphasizing that the rights derived from the FELA
were independent of the CBA:

"The fact that an injury otherwise compensable under
the FELA was caused by conduct that may have been

512us2$77F 01-08-98 12:21:28 PAGES OPINPGT

259Cite as: 512 U. S. 246 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
subject to arbitration under the RLA does not deprive
an employee of his opportunity to bring an FELA action
for damages. . . . The FELA not only provides railroad
workers with substantive protection against negligent
conduct that is independent of the employer's obligations under its collective-bargaining agreement, but also
affords injured workers a remedy suited to their needs,
unlike the limited relief that seems to be available
through the Adjustment Board. It is inconceivable that
Congress intended that a worker who suffered a disabling injury would be denied recovery under the FELA
simply because he might also be able to process a narrow
labor grievance under the RLA to a successful conclusion." 480 U. S., at 564-565.

It likened Buell to other cases in which the Court had
concluded that "notwithstanding the strong policies encouraging arbitration, `different considerations apply where the
employee's claim is based on rights arising out of a statute designed to provide minimum substantive guarantees
to individual workers,' " id., at 565, quoting Barrentine v.
Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 450 U. S. 728, 737
(1981), and distinguished it from Andrews, which involved a
state wrongful-discharge claim "based squarely" on an alleged breach of a CBA, 480 U. S., at 566.6

6 Buell, of course, involved possible RLA preclusion of a cause of action
arising out of a federal statute, while this case involves RLA pre-emption
of a cause of action arising out of state law and existing entirely independent of the CBA. That distinction does not rob Buell of its force in
this context. See Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic Chef, Inc., 486 U. S. 399,
412 (1988) (Buell principles applicable to determine whether federal labor
law pre-empts a state statute). Principles of federalism demand no less
caution in finding that a federal statute pre-empts state law. See Fort
Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U. S. 1, 21 (1987) (pre-emption of state
statute "should not be lightly inferred in this [labor] area, since the establishment of labor standards falls within the traditional police power of
the State").

Opinion of the Court

D
The pre-emption standard that emerges from the line ofcases leading to

Buell--that a state-law cause of action isnot pre-empted by the RLA if it involves rights and obligations that exist independent of the CBA--is virtually identi-cal to the pre-emption standard the Court employs in cases
involving $ 301 of the LMRA, 29 U. S. C. $ 185.7 In Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U. S. 202 (1985), the Court applied $ 301 pre-emption to a state-law claim for bad-faith han-dling of a worker's compensation claim because the duties
the employer owed the employee, including the duty of goodfaith, were rooted firmly in the CBA. Its pre-emption finding was based on the fact that "the right asserted not onlyderives from the contract, but is defined by the contractual
obligation of good faith, [so that] any attempt to assess lia-bility here inevitably will involve contract interpretation."
Id., at 218.It cautioned, however, that other state-law rights, those
that existed independent of the contract, would not be simi-larly pre-empted:

"Of course, not every dispute concerning employment,or tangentially involving a provision of a collectivebargaining agreement, is pre-empted by $ 301 or otherprovisions of the federal labor law. . . . Nor is there any
suggestion that Congress, in adopting $ 301, wished togive the substantive provisions of private agreements
the force of federal law, ousting any inconsistent stateregulation. . . . Clearly, $ 301 does not grant the parties
to a collective-bargaining agreement the ability to con-tract for what is illegal under state law. In extending
the pre-emptive effect of $ 301 beyond suits for breach
7 Section 301(a) provides federal-court jurisdiction over controversies
involving CBA's and "authorizes federal courts to fashion a body of federal law for the enforcement of these collective bargaining agreements."

of contract, it would be inconsistent with congressionalintent under that section to pre-empt state rules that

proscribe conduct, or establish rights and obligations,independent of a labor contract." Id., at 211-212.

8

In a case remarkably similar to the case before us now,this Court made clear that the existence of a potential CBAbased remedy did not deprive an employee of independentremedies available under state law. In Lingle v. Norge Div.
of Magic Chef, Inc., 486 U. S. 399 (1988), an employee cov-ered by a labor agreement was fired for filing an allegedly
false worker's compensation claim. After filing a grievancepursuant to her CBA, which protected employees against
discharge except for "proper" or "just" cause, she filed a com-plaint in state court, alleging that she had been discharged
for exercising her rights under Illinois worker's compensa-tion laws. The state court had held her state-law claim preempted because "the same analysis of the facts" was re-quired in both the grievance proceeding and the state-court
action. This Court reversed.It recognized that where the resolution of a state-law claim
depends on an interpretation of the CBA, the claim is pre-empted. Id., at 405-406, citing Lueck, supra; Teamsters v.
Lucas Flour Co., 369 U. S. 95 (1962). It observed, however,that "purely factual questions" about an employee's conduct or
an employer's conduct and motives do not "requir[e] a courtto interpret any term of a collective-bargaining agreement."

8 The Court applies these principles in Livadas v. Bradshaw, in which
we reject the claim that an employee's state-law right to receive a penalty
payment from her employer was pre-empted under $ 301 because the penalty was pegged to her wages, which were determined by the governing
CBA. The Court states that "when the meaning of contract terms is not
the subject of dispute, the bare fact that a collective-bargaining agreement
will be consulted in the course of state-law litigation plainly does not require the claim to be extinguished." Ante, at 124, citing Lingle v. Norge
Div. of Magic Chef, Inc., 486 U. S., at 413, n. 12. In addition, it reaffirms
that "$ 301 cannot be read broadly to pre-empt nonnegotiable rights conferred on individual employees as a matter of state law." Ante, at 123.

262 HAWAIIAN AIRLINES, INC. v. NORRIS

Opinion of the Court
486 U. S., at 407. The state-law retaliatory discharge claimturned on just this sort of purely factual question: whether

the employee was discharged or threatened with discharge,and, if so, whether the employer's motive in discharging her
was to deter or interfere with her exercise of rights under
Illinois worker's compensation law.While recognizing that "the state-law analysis might well

involve attention to the same factual considerations as thecontractual determination of whether Lingle was fired for
just cause," id., at 408, the Court disagreed that

"such parallelism render[ed] the state-law analysis dependent upon the contractual analysis. For while theremay be instances in which the National Labor Relations

Act pre-empts state law on the basis of the subjectmatter of the law in question, $ 301 pre-emption merely
ensures that federal law will be the basis for interpret-ing collective-bargaining agreements, and says nothing
about the substantive rights a State may provide to
workers when adjudication of those rights does not de-pend upon the interpretation of such agreements. In

other words, even if dispute resolution pursuant to acollective-bargaining agreement, on the one hand, and
state law, on the other, would require addressing pre-cisely the same set of facts, as long as the state-law claim
can be resolved without interpreting the agreementitself, the claim is `independent' of the agreement for

$ 301 pre-emption purposes." Id., at 408-410.
The Court's ruling in Lingle that the LMRA pre-empts
state law only if a state-law claim is dependent on the interpretation of a CBA is fully consistent with the holding in
Buell, 480 U. S., at 564-565, that the RLA does not pre-empt
"substantive protection . . . independent of the [CBA]," with
the holding in Terminal Railroad, 318 U. S., at 7, that the
RLA does not pre-empt basic "protection . . . laid down by
state authority," with the conclusion in Andrews, 406 U. S.,

Opinion of the Court
at 324, that a state-law claim is pre-empted where it "de-pend[s] on the interpretation" of the CBA, and with the description in Conrail, 491 U. S., at 305, of a minor dispute asone that can be "conclusively resolved" by reference to an
existing CBA. Lingle, in fact, expressly relied on Buell, see
486 U. S., at 411-412, just as earlier RLA cases have drawnanalogies to LMRA principles, see,

e. g., Machinists v. Central Airlines, Inc., 372 U. S. 682, 692 (1963). Given this con-vergence in the pre-emption standards under the two statutes, we conclude that Lingle provides an appropriateframework for addressing pre-emption under the RLA, and
we adopt the Lingle standard to resolve claims of RLA
pre-emption.9

E

In reaching this conclusion, we reject petitioners' suggestion that this contract-dependent standard for minor dis9 It is true, as petitioners observe, that the RLA and the LMRA are not
identical in language, history, and purpose. The LMRA, unlike the RLA,
does not mandate arbitration, nor does it prescribe the types of disputes
to be submitted to arbitration under bargaining agreements. Nonetheless, the common purposes of the two statutes, the parallel development
of RLA and LMRA pre-emption law, see, e. g., Machinists v. Central Airlines, Inc., 372 U. S. 682, 691-692 (1963); Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck,
471 U. S. 202, 210 (1985), and the desirability of having a uniform common
law of labor law pre-emption, cf. Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co.,
394 U. S. 369, 383-384 (1969), support the application of the Lingle standard in RLA cases as well.

Lower courts, too, have recognized the appropriateness of the Lingle
standard to RLA pre-emption analysis. See, e. g., Anderson v. American
Airlines, Inc., 2 F. 3d 590, 595 (CA5 1993) (applying Lingle to analyze
RLA pre-emption); Davies v. American Airlines, Inc., 971 F. 2d 463, 466-
467 (CA10 1992) (same), cert. denied, 508 U. S. 950 (1993); O'Brien v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 972 F. 2d 1, 4 (CA1 1992) (same), cert. denied, 506

N. J. 455, 472-473, 593 A. 2d 750, 758 (1991) (same). But see, e. g., Hubbard v. United Airlines, Inc., 927 F. 2d 1094, 1097 (CA9 1991) (Lingle does
not govern in RLA cases); Lorenz v. CSX Transp., Inc., 980 F. 2d 263, 268

Opinion of the Court
putes is inconsistent with two of our prior cases, Elgin, J. &E. R. Co. v. Burley, 325 U. S. 711 (1945), and Conrail, 491

U. S., at 302. Burley was not a pre-emption case. Rather,it concerned the authority of union officials to settle railroad
workers' individual claims for damages for alleged violationsof the CBA. The railroad urged that the union representative, who had the authority to negotiate CBA's in major dis-putes, enjoyed similar authority to settle individual claims in
minor disputes. In the course of rejecting this claim, theCourt described minor disputes as including the "omitted
case," that is, one "founded upon some incident of the em-ployment relation, or asserted one, independent of those covered by the collective agreement, e. g., claims on account ofpersonal injuries." 325 U. S., at 723.

This language is sweeping, but its effect is limited. Theconflict in Burley, which the parties agreed was a minor dispute, concerned the terms of a CBA, and not some other"incident of the employment relationship," or any "omitted
case." These references, therefore, are dicta. Moreover,even the "omitted case" dictum logically can refer to a norm
that the parties have created but have omitted from theCBA's

explicit language, rather than to a norm establishedby a legislature or a court.

10 Finally, Burley's one specific

example of an "omitted case"--claims for personal injurythat do not depend on the contract--was found in

Buell tobe outside the RLA's exclusive jurisdiction. Nonetheless, to

avoid any confusion, we expressly disavow any language in

10 See Detroit & Toledo Shore Line R. Co. v. Transportation Union, 396
U. S. 142, 154-155 (1969) ("Where a condition is satisfactorily tolerable to
both sides, it is often omitted from the agreement, and it has been suggested that this practice is more frequent in the railroad industry than
in most others") (emphasis added); Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 491 U. S. 299, 311-312 (1989) (recognizing
that CBA's include implied terms arising from " `practice, usage and custom' "); see also Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U. S. 574,
578-579 (1960) (a CBA is "more than a contract; it is a generalized code to
govern a myriad of cases which the draft[ers] cannot wholly anticipate").

Opinion of the Court
Burley suggesting that minor disputes encompass state-lawclaims that exist independent of the CBA.

Conrail, like Burley, involved no pre-emption analysis.The parties agreed that the dispute--a workers' challenge
to the railroad's drug-testing policies--was governed by the
RLA, because Conrail's policy of conducting physical exami-nations was an implied term of the CBA. 491 U. S., at 301.

The only question before the Court was whether the employ-er's drug-testing policy constituted an attempt to add a new
term to the existing agreement, making it a major disputesubject to a "protracted process" of bargaining and mediation, id., at 303, or whether the testing reflected the employer's interpretation and application of an implied term of the
existing contract, producing a minor dispute subject to a less
onerous process of arbitration. We concluded that the dispute was minor, stating that "[t]he distinguishing feature
of [a minor dispute] is that the dispute may be conclusively
resolved by interpreting the existing [CBA]." Id., at 305,
citing Garrison, The National Railroad Adjustment Board:
A Unique Administrative Agency, 46 Yale L. J. 567, 568, 576
(1937). Obviously, to say that a minor dispute can be "conclusively resolved" by interpreting the CBA is another way
of saying that the dispute does not involve rights that exist
independent of the CBA.

Petitioners, however, pin their hopes on the observation
that "[w]here an employer asserts a contractual right to take
the contested action, the ensuing dispute is minor if the
action is arguably justified by the terms of the parties'
collective-bargaining agreement." 491 U. S., at 307 (emphasis added). They argue that this action involves a minor
dispute because the termination of respondent was "arguably
justified" by the CBA's provision permitting termination for
"just cause." This "arguably justified" standard, however,
was employed only for policing the line between major and
minor disputes. Recognizing that accepting a party's characterization of a dispute as "minor" ran the risk of under512us2$77F 01-08-98 12:21:28 PAGES OPINPGT
266 HAWAIIAN AIRLINES, INC. v. NORRIS

Opinion of the Court
cutting the RLA's prohibition "against unilateral impositionof new contractual terms," id., at 306, the Court held that a

dispute would be deemed minor only if there was a sincere,nonfrivolous argument that it turned on the application of
the existing agreement, that is, if it was "arguably justified"by that agreement. Obviously, this test said nothing about
the threshold question whether the dispute was subject tothe RLA in the first place.

III
Returning to the action before us, the question under
Lingle is whether respondent's state-law wrongful-dischargeclaims are independent of the CBA. Petitioners argue that

resort to the CBA is necessary to determine whether re-spondent, in fact, was discharged. This argument is foreclosed by Lingle itself. Lingle teaches that the issue to bedecided in this action--whether the employer's actions make
out the element of discharge under Hawaii law--is a "purelyfactual questio[n]." 486 U. S., at 407.

Nor are we persuaded by petitioners' contention that thestate tort claims require a determination whether the discharge, if any, was justified by respondent's failure to signthe maintenance record, as the CBA required him to do. Although such a determination would be required with regardto respondent's separate allegation of discharge in violation
of the CBA, the District Court dismissed that count as pre-empted by the RLA, and respondent does not challenge that
dismissal. The state tort claims, by contrast, require onlythe purely factual inquiry into any retaliatory motive of the
employer.Accordingly, we agree with the Supreme Court of Hawaii
that respondent's claims for discharge in violation of publicpolicy and in violation of the Hawaii Whistleblower Protection Act are not pre-empted by the RLA, and we affirm thatcourt's judgment.

It is so ordered.

DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF WORKERS' COMPENSATIONPROGRAMS, DEPARTMENT OF LABOR

v. GREEN-WICH COLLIERIES
et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 93-744. Argued April 25, 1994--Decided June 20, 1994*
In adjudicating separate benefits claims under the Black Lung Benefits

Act (BLBA) and the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act
(LHWCA), the Department of Labor Administrative Law Judges
(ALJ's) both applied the Department's "true doubt" rule. This rule essentially shifts the burden of persuasion to the party opposing the claim
so that when, as here, the evidence is evenly balanced, the benefits
claimant wins. In both cases, the Department's Benefits Review Board
affirmed the ALJ's decision to award benefits. However, the Court of
Appeals vacated the Board's decision in the BLBA case, holding that
the true doubt rule is inconsistent with the Department's own BLBA
regulations, as well as with Mullins Coal Co. of Va. v. Director, Office
of Workers' Compensation Programs, 484 U. S. 135. And, in the
LHWCA case, the court reversed on the ground that the true doubt
rule violates $ 7(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which
states that "[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute, the proponent of
a rule or order has the burden of proof."

Held:

1. Section 7(c)'s burden of proof provision applies to adjudications
under the LHWCA and the BLBA, each of which contains a section
incorporating the APA. Neither 33 U. S. C. $ 923(a), which relieves the
Department of certain evidentiary and procedural requirements in
LHWCA investigations and hearings, nor an ambiguous BLBA regulation providing that claimants be given the benefit of all reasonable
doubt, is sufficient to overcome the presumption that adjudications are
subject to the APA. See Brownell v. Tom We Shung, 352 U. S. 180,
185. Pp. 270-271.

2. The true doubt rule is not consistent with $ 7(c). Pp. 272-281.

(a) An examination of Hill v. Smith, 260 U. S. 592, 594, and other
relevant cases, as well as contemporary evidence treatises, demon*Together with Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs,

strates that, in 1946, the year the APA was enacted, the ordinary meaning of $ 7(c)'s "burden of proof" phrase was burden of persuasion (i. e.,
the obligation to persuade the trier of fact of the truth of a proposition),
not simply burden of production (i. e., the obligation to come forward
with evidence to support a claim). This Court presumes that Congress
intended the phrase to have the meaning generally accepted in the legal
community at the time of enactment. See, e. g., Holmes v. Securities
Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 268. Because the true
doubt rule places the burden of persuasion on the party opposing a benefits award, it violates $ 7(c)'s requirement that that burden rest with the
party seeking the award. Pp. 272-276.

(b) In light of the foregoing, the cursory conclusion set forth in
NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp., 462 U. S. 393, 404, n. 7--
in which the Court stated that $ 7(c) determines only the burden of going
forward, not the burden of persuasion--cannot withstand scrutiny.
Pp. 276-278.

(c) The Department's reliance on imprecise and marginally relevant
passages from the APA's legislative history is unavailing. Pp. 278-280.

(d) The true doubt rule runs afoul of the APA's goal of greater
uniformity of procedure and standardization of administrative practice
among the diverse federal agencies, for under the Department's reading
each agency would be free to decide who bears the burden of persuasion. Pp. 280-281.

3. Because these cases are decided on the basis of $ 7(c), this Court
need not address the Court of Appeals' holding that the true doubt rule
conflicts with BLBA regulations and Mullins Coal. P. 281.

990 F. 2d 730 (first case) and 992 F. 2d 1277 (second case), affirmed.

We review two separate decisions of the Court of Appealsfor the Third Circuit. In one, Andrew Ondecko applied for

disability benefits under the BLBA after working as a coalminer for 31 years. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)
determined that Ondecko had pneumoconiosis (or black lungdisease), that he was totally disabled by the disease, and that
the disease resulted from coal mine employment. In resolv-ing the first two issues, the ALJ relied on the true doubt
rule. In resolving the third, she relied on the rebuttablepresumption that a miner with pneumoconiosis who worked
in the mines for at least 10 years developed the disease be#Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the American

cause of his employment. 20 CFR $ 718.203(b) (1993). TheDepartment's Benefits Review Board affirmed, concluding

that the ALJ had considered all the evidence, had found eachside's evidence to be equally probative, and had properly resolved the dispute in Ondecko's favor under the true doubtrule. The Court of Appeals vacated the Board's decision,
holding that the true doubt rule is inconsistent with theDepartment's own regulations under the BLBA, $ 718.403,
as well as with Mullins Coal Co. of Va. v. Director, Office
of Workers' Compensation Programs, 484 U. S. 135 (1987).990 F. 2d 730 (1993).

In the other case, Michael Santoro suffered a work-relatedback and neck injury while employed by respondent Maher
Terminals. Within a few months Santoro was diagnosedwith nerve cancer, and he died shortly thereafter. His
widow filed a claim under the LHWCA alleging that thework injury had rendered her husband disabled and caused
his death. After reviewing the evidence for both sides, theALJ found it equally probative and, relying on the true
doubt rule, awarded benefits to the claimant. The Boardaffirmed, finding no error in the ALJ's analysis or his application of the true doubt rule. The Court of Appeals reversed,holding that the true doubt rule is inconsistent with $ 7(c)
of the APA. 992 F. 2d 1277 (1993). In so holding, thecourt expressly disagreed with Freeman United Coal Mining Co. v. Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, 988F. 2d 706 (CA7 1993). We granted certiorari to resolve the
conflict. 510 U. S. 1068 (1994).

II
As a threshold matter, we must decide whether $ 7(c)'s bur-den of proof provision applies to adjudications under the

LHWCA and the BLBA. Section 7(c) of the APA applies"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute," and the Department argues that the statutes at issue here make clear that$ 7(c) does not apply. We disagree.

271Cite as: 512 U. S. 267 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
The Department points out that in conducting investiga-tions or hearings pursuant to the LHWCA, the "Board shall

not be bound by common law or statutory rules of evidenceor by technical or formal rules of procedure, except as provided by this chapter." 33 U. S. C. $ 923(a). But the assignment of the burden of proof is a rule of substantive law,
American Dredging Co. v. Miller, 510 U. S. 443, 454 (1994),
so it is unclear whether this exception even applies. Moreimportantly, $ 923 by its terms applies "except as provided

by this chapter," and the chapter provides that $ 7(c) doesindeed apply to the LHWCA. 33 U. S. C. $ 919(d) ("Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, any hearing
held under this chapter shall be conducted in accordance
with [the APA]"); 5 U. S. C. $ 554(c)(2). We do not lightly
presume exemptions to the APA, Brownell v. Tom We
Shung, 352 U. S. 180, 185 (1956), and we do not think $ 923
by its terms exempts the LHWCA from $ 7(c).

The Department's argument under the BLBA fares no better. The BLBA also incorporates the APA (by incorporating parts of the LHWCA), but it does so "except as otherwise provided . . . by regulations of the Secretary." 30
U. S. C. $ 932(a). The Department argues that the following
BLBA regulation so provides: "In enacting [the BLBA], Congress intended that claimants be given the benefit of all reasonable doubt as to the existence of total or partial disability
or death due to pneumoconiosis." 20 CFR $ 718.3(c) (1993).
But we do not think this regulation can fairly be read as
authorizing the true doubt rule and rejecting the APA's burden of proof provision. Not only does the regulation fail
to mention the true doubt rule or $ 7(c), it does not even
mention the concept of burden shifting or burdens of proof.
Accordingly--and assuming, arguendo, that the Department
has the authority to displace $ 7(c) through regulation--this
ambiguous regulation does not overcome the presumption
that these adjudications under the BLBA are subject to

$ 7(c)'s burden of proof provision.

Opinion of the Court

III
We turn now to the meaning of "burden of proof " as usedin $ 7(c). Respondents contend that the Court of Appeals

was correct in reading "burden of proof " to include the bur-den of

persuasion. The Department disagrees, contendingthat "burden of proof " imposes only the burden of production (i. e., the burden of going forward with evidence). Thecases turn on this dispute, for if respondents are correct, the
true doubt rule must fall: because the true doubt rule placesthe burden of persuasion on the party opposing the benefits
award, it would violate $ 7(c)'s requirement that the burdenof persuasion rest with the party seeking the award.

A
Because the term "burden of proof " is nowhere defined inthe APA, our task is to construe it in accord with its ordinary

or natural meaning. Smith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223,228 (1993). It is easier to state this task than to accomplish
it, for the meaning of words may change over time, and manywords have several meanings even at a fixed point in time.
Victor v. Nebraska, 511 U. S. 1, 13-14 (1994); see generallyCunningham, Levi, Green, & Kaplan, Plain Meaning and
Hard Cases, 103 Yale L. J. 1561 (1994). Here we must seekto ascertain the ordinary meaning of "burden of proof " in
1946, the year the APA was enacted.For many years the term "burden of proof " was ambiguous because the term was used to describe two distinct con-cepts. Burden of proof was frequently used to refer to what
we now call the burden of persuasion--the notion that if theevidence is evenly balanced, the party that bears the burden
of persuasion must lose. But it was also used to refer towhat we now call the burden of production--a party's obligation to come forward with evidence to support its claim.See J. Thayer, Evidence at the Common Law 355-384 (1898)
(detailing various uses of the term "burden of proof " among19th-century English and American courts).

Opinion of the Court
The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts was theleading proponent of the view that burden of proof should be

limited to burden of persuasion. In what became an oft-cited case, Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw attempted to distinguish the burden of proof from the burden of producing evidence. Powers v. Russell, 30 Mass. 69 (1833). According tothe Massachusetts court, "the party whose case requires the

proof of [a] fact, has all along the burden of proof." Id., at76. Though the burden of proving the fact remains where
it started, once the party with this burden establishes aprima facie case, the burden to "produce evidence" shifts.
Ibid. The only time the burden of proof--as opposed to the
burden to produce evidence--might shift is in the case of
affirmative defenses. Id., at 77. In the century after Powers, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts continued
to carefully distinguish between the burden of proof and the
burden of production. See, e. g., Smith v. Hill, 232 Mass.
188, 122 N. E. 310 (1919).

Despite the efforts of the Massachusetts court, the dual
use of the term continued throughout the late 19th and early
20th centuries. See 4 J. Wigmore, Evidence $$ 2486-2487,
pp. 3524-3529 (1905); Thayer, supra, at 355; 1 B. Elliott
& W. Elliott, Law of Evidence $ 129, pp. 184-185 (1904); 2
C. Chamberlayne, Modern Law of Evidence $ 936, pp. 1096-
1098 (1911). The ambiguity confounded the treatise writers,
who despaired over the "lamentable ambiguity of phrase
and confusion of terminology under which our law has so
long suffered." Wigmore, supra, at 3521-3522. The writers praised the "clear-thinking" efforts of courts like the
Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, Chamberlayne,
supra, at 1097, n. 3, and agreed that the legal profession
should endeavor to clarify one of its most basic terms. According to Thayer, supra, at 384-385, "[i]t seems impossible
to approve a continuance of the present state of things, under
which such different ideas, of great practical importance and
of frequent application, are indicated by this single ambigu512us2$78J 01-08-98 12:23:11 PAGES OPINPGT

PROGRAMS v. GREENWICH COLLIERIES

Opinion of the Court

ous expression." See also Chamberlayne, supra, at 1098.To remedy this problem, writers suggested that the term

"burden of proof " be limited to the concept of burden of per-suasion, while some other term--such as "burden of proceeding" or "burden of evidence"--be used to refer to the concept
of burden of production. Chamberlayne, supra, $ 936; El-liott & Elliott,

supra, at 185, n. 3. Despite the efforts at
clarification, however, a dwindling number of courts contin-ued to obscure the distinction. See Annot., 2 A. L. R. 1672

(1919) (noting that some courts still fail to properly distin-guish "between the burden of proof and the duty of going
forward with the evidence").

This Court tried to eliminate the ambiguity in the term
"burden of proof " when it adopted the Massachusetts approach. Hill v. Smith, 260 U. S. 592 (1923). Justice Holmes
wrote for a unanimous Court that "it will not be necessary
to repeat the distinction, familiar in Massachusetts since the
time of Chief Justice Shaw, [Powers, supra], and elaborated
in the opinion below, between the burden of proof and the
necessity of producing evidence to meet that already
produced. The distinction is now very generally accepted,
although often blurred by careless speech." Id., at 594.

In the two decades after Hill, our opinions consistently
distinguished between burden of proof, which we defined as
burden of persuasion, and an alternative concept, which we
increasingly referred to as the burden of production or the
burden of going forward with the evidence. See, e. g., Brosnan v. Brosnan, 263 U. S. 345, 349 (1923) (imposition of burden of proof imposes the burden of persuasion, not simply
the burden of establishing a prima facie case); Radio Corp.
of America v. Radio Engineering Laboratories, Inc., 293
U. S. 1, 7-8 (1934) (party who bears the burden of proof
"bears a heavy burden of persuasion"); Commercial Molasses Corp. v. New York Tank Barge Corp., 314 U. S. 104, 111
(1941) (party with the burden of proof bears the "burden of
persuasion," though the opposing party may bear a burden

Opinion of the Court
to "go forward with evidence"); Webre Steib Co. v. Commissioner, 324 U. S. 164, 171 (1945) (claimant bears a "burden
of going forward with evidence . . . as well as the burden ofproof ") (emphasis added). During this period the Courts of

Appeals also limited the meaning of burden of proof to burden of persuasion, and explicitly distinguished this conceptfrom the burden of production.*

The emerging consensus on a definition of burden of proofwas reflected in the evidence treatises of the 1930's and
1940's. "The burden of proof is the obligation which restson one of the parties to an action to persuade the trier of the
facts, generally the jury, of the truth of a proposition whichhe has affirmatively asserted by the pleadings." W. Richardson, Evidence 143 (6th ed. 1944); see also 1 B. Jones, Law
of Evidence in Civil Cases 310 (4th ed. 1938) ("The modernauthorities are substantially agreed that, in its strict

primary sense, `burden of proof ' signifies the duty or obligation of establishing, in the mind of the trier of facts, conviction on the ultimate issue"); J. McKelvey, Evidence 64 (4th
ed. 1932) ("[T]he proper meaning of [burden of proof]" is
"the duty of the person alleging the case to prove it," rather
than "the duty of the one party or the other to introduce
evidence").

We interpret Congress' use of the term "burden of proof "
in light of this history, and presume Congress intended the
phrase to have the meaning generally accepted in the legal
community at the time of enactment. Holmes v. Securities

Opinion of the Court

v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 696-698 (1979).
These principles lead us to conclude that the drafters of the
APA used the term "burden of proof " to mean the burden of
persuasion. As we have explained, though the term had
once been ambiguous, that ambiguity had largely been eliminated by the early 20th century. After Hill, courts and
commentators almost unanimously agreed that the definition
was settled. And Congress indicated that it shared this settled understanding, when in the Communications Act of 1934
it explicitly distinguished between the burden of proof and
the burden of production. 47 U. S. C. $$ 309(e) and 312(d) (a
party has both the "burden of proceeding with the introduction of evidence and the burden of proof "). Accordingly, we
conclude that as of 1946 the ordinary meaning of burden of
proof was burden of persuasion, and we understand the
APA's unadorned reference to "burden of proof " to refer to
the burden of persuasion.

B

We recognize that we have previously asserted the contrary conclusion as to the meaning of burden of proof in $ 7(c)
of the APA. In NLRB v. Transportation Management
Corp., 462 U. S. 393 (1983), we reviewed the National Labor
Relations Board's (NLRB's) conclusion that the employer had
discharged the employee because of the employee's protected
union activity. In such cases the NLRB employed a burden
shifting formula typical in dual motive cases: The employee
had the burden of persuading the NLRB that antiunion animus contributed to the employer's firing decision; the burden
then shifted to the employer to establish as an affirmative
defense that it would have fired the employee for permissible
reasons even if the employee had not been involved in union
activity. Id., at 401-402. The employer claimed that the
NLRB's burden shifting formula was inconsistent with the
National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), but we upheld it as
a reasonable construction of the NLRA. Id., at 402-403.

Opinion of the Court
The employer in Transportation Management argued thatthe NLRB's approach violated $ 7(c)'s burden of proof provision, which the employer read as imposing the burden of per-suasion on the employee. In a footnote, we summarily rejected this argument, concluding that "[$ 7(c)] . . . determines
only the burden of going forward, not the burden of persua-sion.

Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. EPA, [548 F. 2d
998, 1004, 1013-1015 (CADC 1976)]." Id., at 404, n. 7. Inlight of our discussion in Part II-A above, we do not think

our cursory conclusion in the Transportation Managementfootnote withstands scrutiny. The central issue in

Transportation Management was whether the NLRB's burden
shifting approach was consistent with the NLRA. The parties and the amici in Transportation Management treated
the APA argument as an afterthought, devoting only one or
two sentences to the question. None of the briefs in the
case attempted to explain the ordinary meaning of the term.
Transportation Management's cursory answer to an ancillary and largely unbriefed question does not warrant the
same level of deference we typically give our precedents.

Moreover, Transportation Management reached its conclusion without referring to Steadman v. SEC, 450 U. S. 91
(1981), our principal decision interpreting the meaning of

$ 7(c). In Steadman we considered what standard of proof

$ 7(c) required, and we held that the proponent of a rule or
order under $ 7(c) had to meet its burden by a preponderance
of the evidence, not by clear and convincing evidence.
Though we did not explicitly state that $ 7(c) imposes the
burden of persuasion on the party seeking the rule or order,
our reasoning strongly implied that this must be so. We
assumed that burden of proof meant burden of persuasion
when we said that we had to decide "the degree of proof
which must be adduced by the proponent of a rule or order
to carry its burden of persuasion in an administrative proceeding." Id., at 95 (emphasis added). More important, our
holding that the party with the burden of proof must prove

PROGRAMS v. GREENWICH COLLIERIES

Opinion of the Court

its case by a preponderance only makes sense if the burdenof proof means the burden of persuasion. A standard of

proof, such as preponderance of the evidence, can apply onlyto a burden of persuasion, not to a burden of production.

We do not slight the importance of adhering to precedent,particularly in a case involving statutory interpretation.
But here our precedents are in tension, and we think ourapproach in

Steadman makes more sense than does theTransportation Management footnote. And although we

reject Transportation Management's reading of $ 7(c), theholding in that case remains intact. The NLRB's approach
in Transportation Management is consistent with $ 7(c) be-cause the NLRB first required the employee to persuade it
that antiunion sentiment contributed to the employer's deci-sion. Only then did the NLRB place the burden of persuasion on the employer as to its affirmative defense.

C
In addition to the Transportation Management footnote,the Department relies on the Senate and House Judiciary

Committee Reports on the APA to support its claim thatburden of proof means only burden of production. See

En-vironmental Defense Fund v. EPA, 548 F. 2d, at 1014-1015

(accepting this argument), cited in Transportation Manage-ment, supra, at 404, n. 7. We find this legislative history
unavailing. The Senate Judiciary Committee Report on theAPA states as follows:

"That the proponent of a rule or order has the burdenof proof means not only that the party initiating the proceeding has the general burden of coming forward witha prima facie case but that other parties, who are proponents of some different result, also for that purpose havea burden to maintain. Similarly the requirement that
no sanction be imposed or rule or order be issued exceptupon evidence of the kind specified means that the proponents of a denial of relief must sustain such denial by

Opinion of the Court
that kind of evidence. For example, credible and cred-ited evidence submitted by the applicant for a license

may not be ignored except upon the requisite kind andquality of contrary evidence. No agency is authorized
to stand mute and arbitrarily disbelieve credible evi-dence. Except as applicants for a license or other privilege may be required to come forward with a prima facieshowing, no agency is entitled to presume that the conduct of any person or status of any enterprise is unlaw-ful or improper." S. Rep. No. 752, 79th Cong., 1st Sess.,
22 (1945).
The House Judiciary Committee Report contains identicallanguage, along with the following:

"In other words, this section means that every propo-nent of a rule or order or the denial thereof has the
burden of coming forward with sufficient evidence there-for; and in determining applications for licenses or other
relief any fact, conduct, or status so shown by credibleand credited evidence must be accepted as true except
as the contrary has been shown or such evidence hasbeen rebutted or impeached by duly credited evidence
or by facts officially noticed and stated." H. R. Rep.No. 1980, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 36 (1946).

The Department argues that this legislative history indi-cates congressional intent to impose a burden of production
on the proponent. But even if that is so, it does not meanthat $ 7(c) is concerned

only with imposing a burden of pro-duction. That Congress intended to impose a burden of production does not mean that Congress did not also intend toimpose a burden of persuasion.

Moreover, these passages are subject to a natural inter-pretation compatible with congressional intent to impose a
burden of persuasion on the party seeking an order. Theprimary purpose of these passages is not to define or allocate
the burden of proof. The quoted passages are primarily

Opinion of the Court

concerned with the burden placed on the opponent in admin-istrative hearings ("other parties . . . have a burden to maintain"), particularly where the opponent is the Government.The Committee appeared concerned with those cases in
which the "proponent" seeks a license or other privilege fromthe Government, and in such cases did not want to allow
the agency "to stand mute and arbitrarily disbelieve credibleevidence." The Reports make clear that once the licensee
establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the Gov-ernment to rebut it. This is perfectly compatible with a rule
placing the burden of persuasion on the applicant, becausewhen the party with the burden of persuasion establishes a
prima facie case supported by "credible and credited evi-dence," it must either be rebutted or accepted as true.

The legislative history the Department relies on is impre-cise and only marginally relevant. Congress chose to use
the term "burden of proof " in the text of the statute, andgiven the substantial evidence that the ordinary meaning of
burden of proof was burden of persuasion, this legislativehistory cannot carry the day.

D
In part due to Congress' recognition that claims such asthose involved here would be difficult to prove, claimants in

adjudications under these statutes benefit from certain stat-utory presumptions easing their burden. See 33 U. S. C.

$ 920; 30 U. S. C. $ 921(c); Del Vecchio v. Bowers, 296 U. S.280, 286 (1935). Similarly, the Department's solicitude for
benefits claimants is reflected in the regulations adoptingadditional presumptions. See 20 CFR $$ 718.301-718.306
(1993); Mullins Coal, 484 U. S., at 158. But with the truedoubt rule the Department attempts to go one step further.
In so doing, it runs afoul of the APA, a statute designed"to introduce greater uniformity of procedure and standardization of administrative practice among the diverse

agencies whose customs had departed widely from eachother." Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U. S. 33, 41

(1950). That concern is directly implicated here, for underthe Department's reading each agency would be free to decide who shall bear the burden of persuasion. Accordingly,the Department cannot allocate the burden of persuasion in
a manner that conflicts with the APA.

IV
Under the Department's true doubt rule, when the evi-dence is evenly balanced the claimant wins. Under $ 7(c),

however, when the evidence is evenly balanced, the benefitsclaimant must lose. Accordingly, we hold that the true
doubt rule violates $ 7(c) of the APA.Because we decide these cases on the basis of $ 7(c), we
need not address the Court of Appeals' holding in Greenwich
Collieries that the true doubt rule conflicts with $ 718.403 orwith Mullins Coal, supra.

Affirmed.
Justice Souter, with whom Justice Blackmun and
Justice Stevens join, dissenting.

For more than 50 years, in adjudicating benefits claimsunder the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation

Act (LHWCA), 33 U. S. C. $ 901 et seq., and for more than 15years under the Black Lung Benefits Act (BLBA), 30 U. S. C.

$ 901 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. IV), the Department ofLabor has applied the "true doubt" rule, providing that when
the evidence submitted by a claimant and by a party oppos-ing the award is of equal weight, the claimant wins. The
rule thus places the risk of nonpersuasion on the opponentof the benefits claim. Today, the Court strikes the rule
down as conflicting with $ 7(c) of the Administrative Proce-dure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. $ 556(d), passed by Congress in
1946. I respectfully dissent.

So far as relevant, $ 7(c) of the APA states that

"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute, the propo-nent of a rule or order has the burden of proof. Any

oral or documentary evidence may be received, but theagency as a matter of policy shall provide for the exclusion of irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evi-dence. A sanction may not be imposed or rule or order
issued except on consideration of the whole record orthose parts thereof cited by a party and supported by
and in accordance with the reliable, probative, and sub-stantial evidence." 5 U. S. C. $ 556(d).

The majority's holding that "burden of proof " in the firstsentence of this provision means "burden of persuasion"
surely carries the force of the preferred meaning of the termin today's general usage, as the Court's opinion demonstrates. But we are concerned here not with the commonlypreferred meaning of the term today, but with its meaning
as understood and intended by Congress in enacting $ 7(c) ofthe APA in 1946. That is not a matter about which preference has been constant, or Congress silent, or even a subjectof first impression for this Court.

The phrase "burden of proof " has been used in two ways,to mean either the burden of persuasion (the risk of nonpersuasion), see 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 2486 (J. Chadbournrev. 1981) (hereinafter Wigmore), or the burden of production (of going forward with evidence), see id., $ 2487. Thelatter sense arose from the standard common-law rule that
in order "to keep the jury within the bounds of reasonableaction," the party bearing the burden of production had to
put forth enough evidence to make a prima facie case inorder to get to the jury.

Ibid. At the turn of the century,Thayer noted that burden of proof, in the sense of "going

forward with argument or evidence," is "the meaning of theterm in common speech . . . [and] also a familiar legal

usage . . . ." J. Thayer, A Preliminary Treatise on Evidenceat the Common Law 385-386 (1898). Thayer described

Chief Justice Shaw's unsuccessful attempts to restrict theMassachusetts courts to the other (burden of persuasion)
meaning of the phrase, id., at 355-357, 385-387, and n. 1, andargued that since the "widest legal usage" of the phrase and
"the use of the phrase in ordinary discourse" was to meanburden of production, burden of proof should only be used in
that sense, see Thayer, The Burden of Proof, 4 Harv. L. Rev.45, 69 (1890).

Although the Court works hard to show that the phrasehad acquired a settled meaning in the alternative sense by
the time the APA was passed in 1946, there is good evidencethat the courts were still using the term either way and that
Congress followed Thayer. Indeed, just nine years afterHill v. Smith, 260 U. S. 592 (1923), in which Justice Holmes
is said to have firmed up the use of "burden of proof " tomean burden of persuasion, this Court reverted to using the
phrase in its burden of production sense instead.1 SeeHeiner v. Donnan, 285 U. S. 312, 329 (1932) ("A rebuttable
[prima facie] presumption clearly is a rule of evidence whichhas the effect of shifting the burden of proof ") (citing Mobile,
J. & K. C. R. Co. v. Turnipseed, 219 U. S. 35, 43 (1910) (statingthat "[t]he only legal effect of this [presumption] is to cast
upon [defendant] the duty of producing some evidence to thecontrary")). In such usage

Heiner appears in line withHawes v. Georgia, 258 U. S. 1 (1922) (upholding rebuttable

presumption casting "burden of proof " on defendant in crimi-nal case); see Tot v. United States, 319 U. S. 463, 470-471
(1943) (describing Hawes as involving statutory provisionthat permissibly "shift[ed] the burden of proof " once a prima
facie case was made by prosecution). And courts just threeyears before the passage of the APA held that burden of
proof was at least sometimes used by Congress to mean

321 U. S. 119 (1944).

Contrary to the Court's understanding, commentators didnot think the ambiguity of the phrase had disappeared before

passage of the APA, and, at the time, some even thought itunsettled whether burden of persuasion or of going forward
with the evidence was the primary meaning of the phrase.As one commentator (relied on by the majority here) explained in 1938, although in its "strict primary sense, `burden
of proof ' signifies" burden of persuasion, "[i]n its secondary
sense, the expression `burden of proof ' signifies the duty that
rests upon a party of going forward with the evidence at any
given stage of the case--although eminent authority holds
that this is, or should be, its primary sense." 1 B. Jones,
Law of Evidence in Civil Cases $ 176, p. 310 (4th ed. 1938)
(citing Thayer). He noted: "The expression `burden of
proof ' has not a fixed and unvarying meaning and application. On the contrary, it is used, at times indiscriminately,
to signify one or both of two distinct and separate ideas.
Courts and commentators have striven to correct this variable usage and bring clarity and uniformity to the subject, but without noticeable success." Jones, supra, at 309
(footnote omitted). That commentary retained substantially
the same description 20 years later, and thereafter, see
1 B. Jones, Law of Evidence, Civil and Criminal, $ 204,
pp. 361-363 (5th ed. 1958); 1 S. Gard, Jones on Evidence $ 5:1,
pp. 519-520 (6th ed. 1972). Other commentators noted the
persistent confusion of the terms in the 1940's. See, e. g., W.
Richardson, Law of Evidence $ 172 (6th ed. 1944) (" `[B]urden
of proof ' is frequently misused by our courts"); J. Maguire,
Evidence, Common Sense and Common Law 175 (1947)

express two rather different ideas, and as might be expected

this usage has led to a jumble"). Further, at the time of theAPA's passage, the American Law Institute, Model Code of

Evidence (1942), noted both meanings, see Wigmore $ 2485,at 284, comments. Thus, courts and commentators continued to note the two meanings both before and long after theenactment of the APA, and use of "burden of proof " in either
of its senses continued to create "the lamentable ambiguityof phrase and confusion of terminology under which our law
has so long suffered," id., $ 2485.Although standard usage had not made a choice of meanings by 1946, Congress did make one, and the meaning itchose for the phrase as used in $ 7(c) was "burden of production." In extensive Reports on the pending legislation, boththe Senate and the House explained the meaning of $ 7(c):

"That the proponent of a rule or order has the burdenof proof means not only that the party initiating the proceeding has the general burden of coming forward witha prima facie case but that other parties, who are proponents of some different result, also for that purpose havea burden to maintain. Similarly the requirement that
no sanction be imposed or rule or order be issued exceptupon evidence of the kind specified means that the proponents of a denial of relief must sustain such denial bythat kind of evidence. . . ." S. Rep. No. 752, 79th Cong.,

"The first and second sentences of the section there-fore mean that, where a party having the burden of

proceeding has come forward with a prima facie andsubstantial case, he will prevail unless his evidence
is discredited or rebutted." Id., at 36-37, Leg. Hist.270-271.

Because Congress stated that "burden of proof means" a"burden of coming forward," and further explained that the
burden could be shouldered by both proponents and oppo-nents of a rule or order, the strong probability is that Congress meant to use "burden of proof " to mean burden of com-ing forward and not burden of persuasion, for a burden of
persuasion cannot simultaneously rest on both parties. Seegenerally Wigmore $ 2489. The commentators agree. "The
legislative history suggests that the term `burden of proof 'was intended to denote the `burden of going forward.' " 1
C. Koch, Administrative Law and Practice $ 6.42, p. 486(1985); "The legislative history of the A. P. A. burden of proof
provision states that the party initiating the proceeding has,at a minimum, the burden of establishing a prima facie case,
but a burden of proof may also rest on other parties seekinga different decision by the agency." 4 J. Stein, G. Mitchell,

pp. 257-258 (2d ed. 1980) (citing a lower court's "analysis ofthe Senate and House reports on the APA and the Attorney
General's Manual").

2 The Attorney General found the phrase ambiguous, noting that "[t]here
is some indication that the term `burden of proof' was not employed in
any strict sense, but rather as synonymous with the `burden of going forward.' In either case, it is clear from the introductory clause that this
general statement was not intended to repeal specific provisions of other
statutes which, as by establishing presumptions, alter what would otherwise be the `burden of proof' or the `burden of going forward.' " Attorney

The congressional choice of the burden of productionmeaning was in fact understood from the first and was the

subject of some lament by commentators, who criticized thefirst sentence of $ 7(c) (already in its current formulation as
"the proponent of a rule or order has the burden of proof ")as unhelpful:

"The first sentence is confusing, and is at bestunimportant. . . . For example, where a hearing is called
to determine whether or not a license application shouldbe granted, the `proponent' of the `order' would seem to
be the applicant if the order turns out to be an ordergranting the application, or the agency if the order turns
out to be an order denying the application. We con-clude that this sentence should be eliminated from the
bill." Committee on Administrative Law of New YorkState Bar Assn. and Association of the Bar of the City
of New York, Joint Report on Proposed Federal Admin-istrative Procedure Act 16 (Dec. 26, 1945).

It was certainly not their understanding that this provisionestablished a uniform burden of persuasion.

II
Until today, this Court's reading of $ 7(c) has been con-sonant with the congressional understanding. In

NLRB v.

3 Congressional intent that in $ 7(c) burden of proof mean burden of production is further confirmed by the fact that as originally introduced in
the House, $ 7(c) stated that "[t]he proponent of a rule or order shall have
the burden of proceeding except as statutes otherwise provide." H. R.

see Leg. Hist. 11, 300. Congress prepared extensive side-by-side comparisons of the bill as introduced and as amended into its enacted form, but
neither Congress nor any of the commentators gave any indication that
the change in language was intended to change the meaning of the sentence. See generally Senate Judiciary Committee, Text of S. 7, Respecting Federal Administrative Procedure and Judicial Review and Revised

Souter, J., dissenting

Transportation Management Corp., 462 U. S. 393 (1983), thisCourt considered the phrase "burden of proof " as used in

that section and rejected the position the Court now takes.In Transportation Management, the Court upheld the rule
of the National Labor Relations Board (Board), that its Gen-eral Counsel has the burden of persuading the Board that
antiunion animus contributed to an employer's decision tofire the employee, and that the burden of persuasion then
shifts to the employer to prove that the employee wouldhave been fired even without involvement in protected union
activities. Confronting the employer's argument that $ 7(c)
barred the Board from ever shifting the burden of persuasion to the employer, the Court rejected it, on the groundthat $ 7(c) "determines only the burden of going forward, not

the burden of persuasion." Id., at 404, n. 7 (citing Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. EPA, 548 F. 2d 998, 1004, 1013-
1015 (CADC 1976) (Leventhal, J.)).Today's abandonment of

Transportation Management's
holding is not only a mistake, but one that puts the Courtat odds with that fundamental principle of precedent that

"[c]onsiderations of stare decisis have special force in the
area of statutory interpretation, for . . . Congress remainsfree to alter what we have done."

Patterson v. McLean

4 Even on the assumption that the conclusion reached

in Transportation Management was debatable at the time
the case was decided, it was undoubtedly a reasonable construction of a phrase that (as shown above) was ambiguous

4 I note in this regard that none of the parties argued for overruling
Transportation Management; only amicus American Insurance Association did so; and the courts below did not pass on the question. Rather,
respondents argue that Transportation Management does not bar the
conclusion that a different sentence of $ 7(c) places the burden of persuasion on the proponent of an order.

in the general usage of 1946, and in the 11 years since theconstruction was settled by

Transportation Management,
Congress has not seen fit to disturb it by amending $ 7(c).Compare,

e. g., Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa
Clara Cty., 480 U. S. 616, 629-630, n. 7 (1987), with Califano
v. Sanders, 430 U. S. 99, 105-107 (1977). The settled con-struction should therefore stand.

This Court, like the court below, tries to avoid Transportation Management by implying that the Court's definition of
burden of proof in $ 7(c) as burden of production was inessen-tial to its holding, since the Court only allowed the burden

of persuasion to be placed on the employer after the NLRB
had met its burden of persuasion on the elements of an unfair
labor practice. 992 F. 2d 1277, 1281-1284 (CA3 1993); cf.
ante, at 278 ("[T]he holding in that case remains intact").
The problem with this reading of Transportation Management, however, is that it is not at all what this Court said,
or could have said. The reasoning chosen by the Court to
justify its conclusion was that burden of proof in $ 7(c) means
burden of production, and thus is no impediment to the
Board's rule. And in so explaining, the Court cited the leading case from the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that had held "proof " synonymous with "production" in the text under examination. Environmental
Defense Fund, supra.

The Court also reasons that the burden of proof holding of
Transportation Management should be abandoned as conflicting with Steadman v. SEC, 450 U. S. 91 (1981), a decision
announced just two Terms prior to Transportation Management. But Steadman and Transportation Management are
simply not inconsistent with each other. Indeed, neither the
parties to Transportation Management nor the Court itself
saw Steadman as even relevant to the questions presented
in Transportation Management. In Steadman, a mutual
funds manager argued that in a disciplinary proceeding to
determine whether he had violated the federal securities

laws, the Securities and Exchange Commission had no choicebut to use the clear-and-convincing standard of proof, rather

than the standard of preponderance of the evidence. Steadman read the third sentence of $ 7(c) (a rule or order must
be "supported by and in accordance with the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence") to mean that preponderanceof the evidence, not the clear-and-convincing standard, applies in adjudications under the APA. Steadman thus holdsthat the party with the burden of persuasion must satisfy it
by a preponderance, but does not purport to define "burdenof proof " under the APA or to decide who bears the burden
of persuasion, since it was uncontested in that case that the
burden of persuasion was on the Government in a securities
disciplinary proceeding. Transportation Management, on
the other hand, holds that "burden of proof " in $ 7(c) means
burden of production. The question left open by each decision is who bears the burden of persuasion. As to that, $ 7(c)
is silent.

It is also worth remarking that Transportation Management came as no surprise when it was decided, other federal
courts having anticipated this Court's reading of the $ 7(c)
burden as one of production. See, e. g., Environmental
Defense Fund, Inc. v. EPA, 548 F. 2d, at 1013 (" `burden
of proof ' [$ 7(c)] casts upon the `proponent' is the burden of
coming forward with proof, and not the ultimate burden of
persuasion"); Old Ben Coal Corp. v. Interior Bd. of Mine
Operations Appeals, United States Dept. of Interior, 523
F. 2d 25, 40 (CA7 1975) ("burden of putting forth a prima
facie case"); Maine v. United States Dept. of Labor, 669 F. 2d

to make out a prima facie case"); but cf. Kerner v. Flemming,
283 F. 2d 916, 921-922, and n. 8 (CA2 1960) (assuming, arguendo, the term meant burden of persuasion). And at least
since Transportation Management, every Court of Appeals

has understood that the question was firmly settled by

ed. 1992) ("[T]he burden of proof under the APA refers onlyto the burden of going forward with evidence") (each citing

Transportation Management, 462 U. S., at 403, n. 7).Nor is there any argument that the vitality has gone out of
Transportation Management over the last 11 years. This
Court, indeed, has cited the case for the very propositionthat the Court now repudiates, in the course of explaining

that we ourselves had used the term "burden of proof " inTitle VII suits to mean burden of production, not burden
of persuasion:

"[T]o the extent that those cases speak of an employer's
`burden of proof ' with respect to a legitimate businessjustification defense . . . they should have been understood to mean an employer's production--but not per-suasion--burden. Cf.,

e. g., NLRB v. Transportation
Management Corp., 462 U. S. 393, 404, n. 7 (1983)."
Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U. S. 642, 660
(1989).

If the Wards Cove Court could rely on Transportation Management to hold that in innumerable Title VII disparate-impact cases over many years we (and the lower courts) had

used the term "burden of proof " to mean only "burden ofproduction" it is hard to place much weight on the majority's
reference to a consistent practice to the contrary since 1923.

Today's decision to repudiate Transportation Management is made more regrettable by the fact that the Court's
adherence to the case in Ward's Cove came after the Courthad been made aware of the role of the true doubt rule in

black lung litigation, which presupposed Transportation
Management's reading of $ 7(c). In Mullins Coal Co. of Va.
v. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, 484
U. S. 135 (1987), upholding the Secretary of Labor's interpretation of a BLBA interim regulation about the prima facie
standard for invoking a statutory presumption of eligibility,
this Court explicitly noted the operation of the true doubt

rule once both parties' evidence had been introduced and (ashere) the presumption had dropped out of the case. See id.,

at 144, n. 12 (true doubt rule "ensures that the employerwill win, on invocation or rebuttal, only when its evidence is
stronger than the claimant's"). We acknowledged the Secre-tary's position that the BLBA " `embodies the principle that
doubt is to be resolved in favor of the claimant, [which] playsan important role in claims determinations . . . [,]' "

id., at156, n. 29 (quoting 43 Fed. Reg. 36826 (1978)), and that the

Benefits Review Board "has consistently upheld the principlethat, where true doubt exists, that doubt shall be resolved
in favor of the claimant," 484 U. S., at 144, n. 12 (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted).Had we, indeed, suggested otherwise, we would have been

bucking the strong tide that the Court turns back today, forthe other federal courts have been applying some form of the
true doubt rule, either as judicial statutory interpretation oras the agency's rule, in adjudicating claims after enactment
of the APA, as well as before it, for a good 50 years. See,

Because $ 7(c) is silent on the burden of persuasion, the jobof placing it is left to the bounded discretion of the agencies,

subject to judicial review, when interpreting their organicstatutes, by customary reference to statutory text, congressional intent, experience, policy, and relevant evidentiaryprobabilities. See 3 Davis, Administrative Law $ 16.9, at
257-258.6 This is only to be expected, since the issue of whobears the risk of nonpersuasion raises a traditional "question
of policy and fairness based on experience in . . . differentsituations." Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, Denver, 413 U. S.
189, 209 (1973) (quoting 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 2486, p. 275(3d ed. 1940)); accord, 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence

$ 337, p. 427 (4th ed. 1992), not a matter readily lumped inwith the formalities of procedure. While the APA was
meant to provide for uniform procedures in administrativeadjudications, it is unremarkable that it stopped short of
making a substantive policy choice that in every formal hear-ing the burden of persuasion must rest on one party or the
other.

Souter, J., dissenting

Nor, apart from $ 7(c), are the choices made under the stat-utes in question here vulnerable on judicial scrutiny. In

LHWCA cases over the last 50 years, the assignment to theemployer of the risk of nonpersuasion can be seen as placing
it on "those best able to bear it," F. H. McGraw & Co., supra,
at 887, 888, and as comporting with both the remedial natureof the LHWCA, see

Northeast Marine Terminal Co. v. Caputo, 432 U. S. 249, 268 (1977), and the dangerous nature oflongshoring, see S. Rep. No. 92-1125, p. 2 (1972). As to the

BLBA, there is no question about the consistency of congres-sional intent with the recitation in the Secretary's regulation, 20 CFR $ 718.3(c) (1993), that "Congress intended that
[BLBA] claimants be given the benefit of all reasonable
doubt as to the existence of total or partial disability or death
due to pneumoconiosis." As Congress explained, the BLBA
"is intended to be a remedial law. . . . In the absence of definitive medical conclusions there is a clear need to resolve
doubts in favor of the disabled miner or his survivors." S.
Rep. No. 92-743, p. 11 (1972). The true doubt rule has been
applied in these benefits adjudications for more than 15
years, see, e. g., Black Lung--A Study in Occupational Disease Compensation (1976), reprinted in Black Lung Benefits
Reform Act, 1976: Hearings on H. R. 10760 and S. 3183 before the Subcommittee on Labor of the Senate Committee on
Labor and Public Welfare, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., 459, 488-489
(1976) ("[C]onflicts in the evidence are required to be resolved by the adjudicator in favor of the claimant"); Provance v. United States Steel Corp., 1 BLR 1-483, 485-486
(Benefits Rev. Bd. 1978), and the Secretary's true doubt rule
fully comports with Congress's "expectation that the Secretary of Labor will promulgate standards which give the benefit of any doubt to the coal miner." S. Rep. No. 95-209,
p. 13 (1977); see 43 Fed. Reg. 36826 (1978).

The court below did not deny the harmony of the true
doubt rule with congressional policy in these cases, but it
held instead that the use of the true doubt rule in BLBA

cases conflicts with 20 CFR $ 718.403 (1993), a Departmentof Labor regulation providing that "[e]xcept as provided in

this subchapter, the burden of proving a fact alleged in con-nection with any provision of this part shall rest with the
party making such allegation." But the phrase "burdenof proving," like its cognate, "burden of proof," is susceptible of two meanings, including the meaning given by theagency interpretation, as imposing only the burden of producing evidence. The Department of Labor is entitled to"substantial deference" in the interpretation of its own regulations, and the agency's interpretation need only be reason-able in light of the regulations' text and purpose,

Martin v.
Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm'n, 499 U. S.144, 150-151 (1991); accord, Bowles v. Seminole Rock & Sand

Co., 325 U. S. 410, 414 (1945). The agency's interpretationof its regulation is surely reasonable here, given our own
prior interpretation of "burden of proof " as referring onlyto production.

The Department of Labor's decision in the true doubt rule,to assign the burden of persuasion to the employer in cases
involving harms to workers in the longshore and coal miningindustries, is thus permissible and free from conflict with

$ 7(c) of the APA. I would sustain the Department's rule,and accordingly offer this respectful dissent.

BARCLAYS BANK PLC v. FRANCHISE TAX BOARDOF CALIFORNIA

certiorari to the court of appeal of california,third appellate district

No. 92-1384. Argued March 28, 1994--Decided June 20, 1994*
During the years at issue in these consolidated cases, California used a

"worldwide combined reporting" method to determine the corporate
franchise tax owed by unitary multinational corporate group members
doing business in California. California's method first looked to the
worldwide income of the unitary business, and then taxed a percentage
of that income equal to the average of the proportions of worldwide
payroll, property, and sales located within California. In contrast, the
Federal Government employs a "separate accounting" method, which
treats each corporate entity discretely for the purpose of determining
income tax liability. In Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax
Bd., 463 U. S. 159, this Court upheld the California scheme as applied to
domestic-based multinationals, but did not address the constitutionality
of the scheme as applied to domestic corporations with foreign parents
or to foreign corporations with foreign parents or foreign subsidiaries.
Both petitioner Barclays Bank PLC (Barclays)--a foreign multinational--and petitioner Colgate-Palmolive Co. (Colgate)--a domestic multinational--have operations in California. In separate cases, two members of the Barclays group and Colgate were denied refunds by the
California authorities.

Held: The Constitution does not impede application of California's tax to

Barclays and Colgate. Pp. 310-331.

(a) Absent congressional approval, a state tax on interstate or foreign
commerce will not survive Commerce Clause scrutiny if the taxpayer
demonstrates that the tax (1) applies to an activity lacking a substantial
nexus to the taxing State; (2) is not fairly apportioned; (3) discriminates
against interstate commerce; or (4) is not fairly related to the services
the State provides. Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S.
274, 279. A tax affecting foreign commerce raises two additional concerns: one prompted by the "enhanced risk of multiple taxation," Container Corp., 463 U. S., at 185, and the other related to the Federal Government's capacity to " `speak with one voice when regulating

*Together with No. 92-1839, Colgate-Palmolive Co. v. Franchise Tax

commercial relations with foreign governments,' " Japan Line, Ltd. v.
County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434, 449. California's tax easily meets
all but the third of the Complete Auto criteria. As to the third,
Barclays has not shown that the system in fact operates to impose
inordinate compliance burdens on foreign enterprises, and its claim of
unconstitutional discrimination against foreign commerce thus fails.
Pp. 310-314.

(b) Nor has Barclays shown that California's "reasonable approximations" method of reducing the compliance burden is incompatible with
due process. Barclays argues that California employs no standard to
determine what approximations will be accepted, but Barclays has presented no example of an approximation California rejected as unreasonable. Furthermore, the state judiciary has construed California law to
curtail the discretion of state tax officials, and the State has afforded
Barclays the opportunity to seek clarification of the meaning of the relevant regulations. Rules governing international multijurisdictional income allocation have an inescapable imprecision given the subject matter's complexity, and rules against vagueness are not mechanically
applied; rather, their application is tied to the nature of the enactment.
Pp. 314-316.

(c) California's system does not expose foreign multinationals, such
as Barclays, to constitutionally intolerable multiple taxation. In the
face of a similar challenge, Container Corp. approved this very tax when
applied to a domestic-based multinational. The considerations that informed the Container Corp. decision are not dispositively diminished
when the tax is applied to a foreign-based enterprise. Multiple taxation is not the inevitable result of California's tax, and the alternative
reasonably available to the State--separate accounting--cannot eliminate, and in some cases may even enhance, the risk of double taxation.
Pp. 316-320.

(d) California's scheme also does not prevent the Federal Government
from speaking with "one voice" in international trade. Congress holds
the control rein in this area. In the 11 years since Container Corp.,
Congress has not barred States from using the worldwide combined
reporting method. In the past three decades, aware that foreign governments deplored use of the method, Congress nevertheless failed to
enact any of numerous bills, or to ratify a treaty provision, that would
have prohibited the practice. Executive Branch actions, statements,
and amicus filings do not supply the requisite federal directive proscribing States' use of worldwide combined reporting, for the regulatory authority is Congress' to wield. Executive Branch communications that
express federal policy but lack the force of law cannot render unconstitu512us2$79Z 01-08-98 12:24:49 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
multinational enterprise, against a comprehensive challengemade under the Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the

Federal Constitution. Container Corp. involved a corporatetaxpayer domiciled and headquartered in the United States;
in addition to its stateside components, the taxpayer had a
number of overseas subsidiaries incorporated in the coun-tries in which they operated. The Court's decision in

Container Corp. did not address the constitutionality of Califor-nia's taxing scheme as applied to "domestic corporations with

foreign parents or [to] foreign corporations with either for-eign parents or foreign subsidiaries."

Id., at 189, n. 26. In
the consolidated cases before us, we return to the taxing
scheme earlier considered in Container Corp. and resolve
matters left open in that case.

The petitioner in No. 92-1384, Barclays Bank PLC (Barclays), is a United Kingdom corporation in the Barclays
Group, a multinational banking enterprise. The petitioner
in No. 92-1839, Colgate-Palmolive Co. (Colgate), is the
United States-based parent of a multinational manufacturing
and sales enterprise. Each enterprise has operations in
California. During the years here at issue, California determined the state corporate franchise tax due for these operations under a method known as "worldwide combined reporting." California's scheme first looked to the worldwide
income of the multinational enterprise, and then attributed
a portion of that income (equal to the average of the proportions of worldwide payroll, property, and sales located in California) to the California operations. The State imposed its
tax on the income thus attributed to Barclays' and Colgate's
California business.

Barclays urges that California's tax system distinctively
burdens foreign-based multinationals and results in double
international taxation, in violation of the Commerce and Due
Process Clauses. Both Barclays and Colgate contend that
the scheme offends the Commerce Clause by frustrating the
Federal Government's ability to "speak with one voice when

application of California's corporate franchise tax to Barclays
and Colgate. Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of theCalifornia Court of Appeal.

A

The Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the Constitution, this Court has held, prevent States that impose an
income-based tax on nonresidents from "tax[ing] valueearned outside [the taxing State's] borders."

ASARCO Inc.
v. Idaho Tax Comm'n, 458 U. S. 307, 315 (1982). But whena business enterprise operates in more than one taxing jurisdiction, arriving at "precise territorial allocations of `value'is often an elusive goal, both in theory and in practice."
Container Corp., 463 U. S., at 164. Every method of alloca-tion devised involves some degree of arbitrariness. See

id.,
at 182.

One means of deriving locally taxable income, generallyused by States that collect corporate income-based taxes, is

the "unitary business" method. As explained in Container
Corp., unitary taxation "rejects geographical or transactional accounting," which is "subject to manipulation" anddoes not fully capture "the many subtle and largely unquantifiable transfers of value that take place among the compo-nents of a single enterprise."

Id., at 164-165. The "unitary
business/formula apportionment" method

"calculates the local tax base by first defining the scope
of the `unitary business' of which the taxed enterprise's
activities in the taxing jurisdiction form one part, and
then apportioning the total income of that `unitary business' between the taxing jurisdiction and the rest of the
world on the basis of a formula taking into account ob512us2$79P 01-08-98 12:24:49 PAGES OPINPGT

jective measures of the corporation's activities withinand without the jurisdiction." Id., at 165.

1

During the income years at issue in these cases--1977 forBarclays, 1970-1973 for Colgate--California assessed its corporate franchise tax by employing a "worldwide combinedreporting" method. California's scheme required the taxpayer to aggregate the income of all corporate entities com-posing the unitary business enterprise, including in the
aggregation both affiliates operating abroad and thoseoperating within the United States. Having defined the
scope of the "unitary business" thus broadly, California useda long-accepted method of apportionment, commonly called
the "three-factor" formula, to arrive at the amount of incomeattributable to the operations of the enterprise in California.
Under the three-factor formula, California taxed a percent-age of worldwide income equal to the arithmetic average of
the proportions of worldwide payroll, property, and sales lo-cated inside the State. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Ann. $ 25128

1 This Court first considered the "unitary business principle" in 1897,
Adams Express Co. v. Ohio State Auditor, 165 U. S. 194, 220-221; we revisited this "settled jurisprudence" most recently in Allied-Signal, Inc. v.
Director, Div. of Taxation, 504 U. S. 768, 779-788 (1992). See generally
1 J. Hellerstein & W. Hellerstein, State Taxation: Corporate Income and
Franchise Taxes || 8.03, p. 8-29 (2d ed. 1993); id., || 8.05. On the determination whether a business is "unitary," see Allied-Signal, 504 U. S., at
781-782 (business may be treated as unitary, compatibly with constitutional limitations, if it exhibits functional integration, centralization of
management, and economies of scale); Edison California Stores, Inc. v.
McColgan, 30 Cal. 2d 472, 481, 183 P. 2d 16, 21 (1947) ("If the operation of
the portion of the business done within the state is dependent upon or
contributes to the operation of the business without the state, the operations are unitary."); Butler Brothers v. McColgan, 17 Cal. 2d 664, 678, 111
P. 2d 334, 341 (1941) (A business is unitary if there is "(1) [u]nity of ownership; (2) [u]nity of operation as evidenced by central purchasing, advertising, accounting and management divisions; and (3) unity of use of its centralized executive force and general system of operation."), aff'd, 315 U.

(West 1992). Thus, if a unitary business had 8% of its payroll, 3% of its property, and 4% of its sales in California, the
State took the average--5%--and imposed its tax on that
percentage of the business' total income.2

B
The corporate income tax imposed by the United States
employs a "separate accounting" method, a means of apportioning income among taxing sovereigns used by all major
developed nations. In contrast to combined reporting, separate accounting treats each corporate entity discretely for
the purpose of determining income tax liability.3

Separate accounting poses the risk that a conglomerate
will manipulate transfers of value among its components to
minimize its total tax liability. To guard against such manipulation, transactions between affiliated corporations must
be scrutinized to ensure that they are reported on an "arm'slength" basis, i. e., at a price reflecting their true market
value. See 26 U. S. C. $ 482; Treas. Reg. $ 1.482-1T(b), 26
CFR $ 1.482-1T(b) (1993).4 Assuming that all transactions
are assigned their arm's-length values in the corporate accounts, a jurisdiction using separate accounting taxes corporations that operate within its borders only on the income

sales factor. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Ann. $ 25128 (West Supp. 1994); 1993

a consolidated federal tax return in lieu of separate returns. 26 U. S. C.

4 Effective enforcement of arm's-length standards requires exacting

scrutiny by the taxing jurisdiction, and some commentators maintain that
the results are arbitrary in any event. See 1 Hellerstein & Hellerstein,
supra, || 8.03 (describing "three inherent defects" of separate accounting:
compliance expense, impracticability, and the difficulty of arriving at
"arm's-length" prices).

Opinion of the Court
those corporations recognize on their own books. See Container Corp., 463 U. S., at 185.5

At one time, a number of States used worldwide combinedreporting, as California did during the years at issue. In

recent years, such States, including California, have modifiedtheir systems at least to allow corporate election of some
variant of an approach that confines combined reporting to
the United States' "water's edge." See 1 Hellerstein & Hell-erstein,

supra n. 1, || 8.16, at 8-185 to 8-187. California's
1986 modification of its corporate franchise tax, effective in1988, 1986 Cal. Stats., ch. 660, $ 6, made it nearly the last

State to give way. 1 Hellerstein & Hellerstein, supra n. 1,|| 8.16, at 8-187.

California corporate taxpayers, under the State's water's
edge alternative, may elect to limit their combined reportinggroup to corporations in the unitary business whose individual presence in the United States surpasses a certain threshold. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Ann. $ 25110 (West 1992); see
Leegstra, Eager, & Stolte, The California Water's-Edge
Election, 6 J. St. Tax'n 195 (1987) (explaining operation of
California's water's edge system). The 1986 amendment
conditioned a corporate group's water's edge election on payment of a substantial fee, and allowed the California Franchise Tax Board (Tax Board) to disregard a water's edge
election under certain circumstances. In 1993, California
again modified its corporate franchise tax statute, this time
to allow domestic and foreign enterprises to elect water's
edge treatment without payment of a fee and without the
threat of disregard. 1993 Cal. Stats., ch. 31, $ 53; id., ch. 881,

The first of these consolidated cases, No. 92-1384, is a tax
refund suit brought by two members of the Barclays Group,
a multinational banking enterprise. Based in the United
Kingdom, the Barclays Group includes more than 220 corporations doing business in some 60 nations. The two refundseeking members of the Barclays corporate family did business in California and were therefore subject to California's
franchise tax. Barclays Bank of California (Barcal), one of
the two taxpayers, was a California banking corporation
wholly owned by Barclays Bank International Limited
(BBI), the second taxpayer. BBI, a United Kingdom corporation, did business in the United Kingdom and in more than
33 other nations and territories.

In computing its California franchise tax based on 1977
income, Barcal reported only the income from its own operations. BBI reported income on the assumption that it
participated in a unitary business composed of itself and its
subsidiaries, but not its parent corporation and the parent's
other subsidiaries. After auditing BBI's and Barcal's 1977
income year franchise tax returns, the Tax Board, respondent here, determined that both were part of a worldwide
unitary business, the Barclays Group. Ultimately, the Tax
Board assessed additional tax liability of $1,678 for BBI and
$152,420 for Barcal.6

308 BARCLAYS BANK PLC v. FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.

Opinion of the Court
Barcal and BBI paid the assessments and sued for refunds.They prevailed in California's lower courts, but were unsuccessful in California's Supreme Court. The California Su-preme Court held that the tax did not impair the Federal
Government's ability to "speak with one voice" in regulatingforeign commerce, see

Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of LosAngeles, 441 U. S., at 449, and therefore did not violate the

Commerce Clause. Having so concluded, the California Su-preme Court remanded the case to the Court of Appeal for
further development of Barclays' claim that the complianceburden on foreign-based multinationals imposed by California's tax violated both the Due Process Clause and the non-discrimination requirement of the Commerce Clause.

Bar-clay's Bank Int'l, Ltd. v. Franchise Tax Bd., 2 Cal. 4th 708,

829 P. 2d 279, cert. denied, 506 U. S. 870 (1992). On remand,the Court of Appeal decided the compliance burden issues
against Barclays, 10 Cal. App. 4th 1742, 14 Cal. Rptr. 2d 537(3d Dist. 1992), and the California Supreme Court denied
further review. The case is therefore before us on writ ofcertiorari to the California Court of Appeal. 510 U. S. 942
(1993). Barclays has conceded, for purposes of this liti-gation, that the entire Barclays Group formed a worldwide
unitary business in 1977.7The petitioner in No. 92-1839, Colgate-Palmolive Co., is a
Delaware corporation headquartered in New York. Colgateand its subsidiaries doing business in the United States

filed California franchise tax returns based on 1970-1973 income, it reported the income earned from its foreign operations on a separate accounting basis. Essentially, Colgate
maintained that the Constitution compelled California to
limit the reach of its unitary principle to the United States'
water's edge. See supra, at 306. The Tax Board determined that Colgate's taxes should be computed on the basis
of worldwide combined reporting, and assessed a 4-year deficiency of $604,765.8 Colgate paid the tax and sued for a
refund.

Colgate prevailed in the California Superior Court, which
found that the Federal Government had condemned worldwide combined reporting as impermissibly intrusive upon
the Nation's ability uniformly to regulate foreign commercial
relations. No. 319715 (Super. Ct. Sacramento Cty., Apr. 19,

Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274, 279(1977).

In "the unique context of foreign commerce," a State'spower is further constrained because of "the special need for

Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ill. v. United States, 289 U. S.48, 59 (1933). A tax affecting foreign commerce therefore

raises two concerns in addition to the four delineated inComplete Auto. The first is prompted by "the enhanced

ment" standard is also satisfied. Neither Barclays nor Col-gate has demonstrated the lack of a "rational relationship

between the income attributed to the State and the intra-state values of the enterprise,"

Container Corp., 463 U. S.,
at 180-181 (internal quotation marks omitted); nor have the
petitioners shown that the income attributed to California is"out of all appropriate proportion to the business transacted

by the [taxpayers] in that State." Id., at 181 (internal quotation marks omitted). We note in this regard that, "if applied by every jurisdiction," California's method "would result in no more than all of the unitary business' income being
taxed." Id., at 169. And surely California has afforded
Colgate and the Barclays taxpayers "protection, opportunities and benefits" for which the State can exact a return.
Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., 311 U. S. 435, 444 (1940); see
ASARCO Inc. v. Idaho State Tax Comm'n, 458 U. S., at 315.

Barclays (but not Colgate) vigorously contends, however,
that California's worldwide combined reporting scheme violates the antidiscrimination component of the Complete Auto

that "California had the requisite nexus with every member of the Barclays group," id., at 27 (emphasis added).

The trial court, however, did not reach the conclusion the United Kingdom suggests it did, nor was there cause for it so to do. As the United
Kingdom recognizes, the theory underlying unitary taxation is that "certain intangible `flows of value' within the unitary group serve to link the
various members together as if they were essentially a single entity."
Id., at 26. Formulary apportionment of the income of a multijurisdictional (but unitary) business enterprise, if fairly done, taxes only the "income generated within a State." Allied-Signal, Inc. v. Director, Div. of
Taxation, 504 U. S., at 783 (upholding "unitary business principle" as "an
appropriate means for distinguishing between income generated within a
State and income generated without"). Quill held that the Commerce
Clause requires a taxpayer's "physical presence" in the taxing jurisdiction
before that jurisdiction can constitutionally impose a use tax. 504 U. S.,
at 317. The California presence of the taxpayers before us is undisputed,
and we find nothing in Quill to suggest that California may not reference
the income of corporations worldwide with whom those taxpayers are
closely intertwined in order to approximate the taxpayers' California
income.

test. Barclays maintains that a foreign owner of a taxpayerfiling a California tax return "is forced to convert its diverse

financial and accounting records from around the world intothe language, currency, and accounting principles of the
United States" at "prohibitiv[e]" expense. Brief for Petitioner in No. 92-1384, p. 44.11 Domestic-owned taxpayers,by contrast, need not incur such expense because they "already keep most of their records in English, in United Statescurrency, and in accord with United States accounting principles." Id., at 45. Barclays urges that imposing this "pro-hibitive administrative burden,"

id., at 43, on foreign-owned
enterprises gives a competitive advantage to their UnitedStates-owned counterparts and constitutes "economic protectionism" of the kind this Court has often condemned.
Id., at 43-46.

Compliance burdens, if disproportionately imposed on
out-of-jurisdiction enterprises, may indeed be inconsonantwith the Commerce Clause. See,

e. g., Hunt v. Washington
State Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333, 350-351(1977) (increased costs imposed by North Carolina statute on

out-of-state apple producers "would tend to shield the localapple industry from the competition of Washington apple
growers," thereby discriminating against those growers).The factual predicate of Barclays' discrimination claim, however, is infirm.

Barclays points to provisions of California's implementingregulations setting out three discrete means for a taxpayer

to fulfill its franchise tax reporting requirements. Each ofthese modes of compliance would require Barclays to gather
and present much information not maintained by the unitary

11 Barclays estimates, and the trial court found, that an accounting system capable of conveying the information Barclays thought California's

group in the ordinary course of business.12 California's reg-ulations, however, also provide that the Tax Board "shall

consider the effort and expense required to obtain the neces-sary information" and, in "appropriate cases, such as when
the necessary data cannot be developed from financial rec-ords maintained in the regular course of business," may accept "reasonable approximations." Cal. Code of Regs., Title18, $ 25137-6(e)(1) (1985). As the Court of Appeal comprehended, in determining Barclays' 1977 worldwide income,Barclays and the Tax Board "used these [latter] provisions
and [made] computations based on reasonable approxima-tions," 10 Cal. App. 4th, at 1756, 14 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 545, thus
allowing Barclays to avoid the large compliance costs ofwhich it complains.

13 Barclays has not shown that California's provision for "reasonable approximations" systemati-cally "overtaxes" foreign corporations generally or BBI or

Barcal in particular.In sum, Barclays has not demonstrated that California's
tax system in fact operates to impose inordinate complianceburdens on foreign enterprises. Barclays' claim of unconstitutional discrimination against foreign commerce thereforefails.

Barclays additionally argues that California's "reasonableapproximations" method of reducing the compliance burden

12 Under the regulations to which Barclays refers, a "unitary business
with operations in foreign countries" may determine its worldwide income
based upon either (1) "[a] profit and loss statement . . . for each foreign
branch or corporation," Cal. Code of Regs., Title 18, $ 25137-6(b)(1) (1985);
(2) the "consolidated profit and loss statement prepared for the related
corporations of which the unitary business is a member which is prepared
for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission," $ 25137-6(b)(2);
or (3) "the consolidated profit and loss statement prepared for reporting
to shareholders and subject to review by an independent auditor," ibid.

13 The California Court of Appeal additionally found that Barclays' actual compliance costs were "relatively modest" during the years just prior
to those here at issue, ranging from $900 to $1,250 per annum, for BBI.

92-1384, at 49. Barclays presents no substantive grievance
concerning the treatment it has received, i. e., no example ofan approximation rejected by the Tax Board as unreasonable. Barclays instead complains that "[t]he grant of stand-ardless discretion itself violates due process," so that the
taxpayer need not show "actual harm from arbitrary applica-tion."

We note, initially, that "reasonableness" is a guide admit-ting effective judicial review in myriad settings, from encounters between the police and the citizenry, see Terry v.
Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 27 (1968) (Fourth Amendment permits po-lice officer's limited search for weapons in circumstances

where "reasonably prudent man . . . would be warranted inthe belief that his safety or that of others was in danger"
based upon "reasonable inferences . . . draw[n] from the factsin light of [officer's] experience"), to the more closely analogous federal income tax context. See, e. g., 26 U. S. C.$ 162(a)(1) (allowing deductions for ordinary business expenses, including a "reasonable allowance for salaries or
other compensation"); $ 167(a) (permitting a "reasonable allowance" for wear and tear as a depreciation deduction); see
also United States v. Ragen, 314 U. S. 513, 522 (1942) (noting
that determinations "by reference to a standard of `reasonableness' [are] not unusual under federal income tax laws").

We next observe that California's judiciary has construed
the California law to curtail the discretion of California tax
officials. See 10 Cal. App. 4th, at 1762, 14 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at
549 (the Tax Board must consider "regularly-maintained or
other readily-accessibly corporate documents" in deciding
whether the "cost and effort of producing [worldwide combined reporting] information" justifies submission of "reasonable approximations"). We note, furthermore, that California has afforded Barclays the opportunity "to clarify the

Title 18, $ 25137-6(e)(2) (1985).Rules governing international multijurisdictional income
allocation have an inescapable imprecision given the com-plexity of the subject matter. See

Container Corp., 463U. S., at 192 (allocation "bears some resemblance . . . to

slicing a shadow").14 Mindful that rules against vaguenessare not "mechanically applied" but depend, in their application, on "the nature of the enactment," Hoffman Estates,455 U. S., at 498, we hold that California's scheme does not
transgress constitutional limitations in this regard, and thatBarclays' due process argument is no more weighty than
its claim of discrimination first placed under a CommerceClause heading.

Opinion of the Court
see Container Corp., 463 U. S., at 184, we proceed to the"additional scrutiny" required when a State seeks to tax foreign commerce. Id., at 185. First of the two additionalconsiderations is "the enhanced risk of multiple taxation."
Ibid.In

Container Corp., we upheld application of California'scombined reporting obligation to "foreign subsidiaries of

domestic corporations," id., at 193 (emphasis added), againsta charge that such application unconstitutionally exposed
those subsidiaries to a risk of multiple international taxa-tion.

15 Barclays contends that its situation compels a different outcome, because application of the combined reportingobligation to foreign multinationals creates a " `more aggravated' risk . . . of double taxation." Brief for Petitioner inNo. 92-1384, at 32, quoting Nos. 325059 and 325061 (Super.
Ct. Sacramento Cty., Aug. 20, 1987) (reprinted in App. to
Pet. for Cert. in No. 92-1384, p. A-26). Barclays rests itsargument on the observation that "foreign multinationals

typically have more of their operations and entities outsideof the United States [compared to] domestic multinationals,
which typically have a smaller share of their operations andentities outside of the United States." Brief for Petitioner
in No. 92-1384, at 33.16 As a result, a higher proportion ofthe income of a foreign multinational is subject to taxation
by foreign sovereigns. This reality, Barclays concludes,means that for the foreign multinational, which must include
all its foreign operations in the California combined report-ing group, "the breadth of double taxation and the degree of
burden on foreign commerce are greater than in the case of
domestic multinationals." Ibid.

15 We reserved judgment on whether an altered analysis would be required where the taxpayer was part of a foreign-based enterprise. See
Container Corp., 463 U. S., at 189, n. 26; id., at 195, n. 32.

than 220 entities in the Barclays Group did any business in the United
States. Brief for Petitioner in No. 92-1384, at 33.

318 BARCLAYS BANK PLC v. FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.

Opinion of the Court
We do not question Barclays' assertion that multinationalenterprises with a high proportion of income taxed by jurisdictions with wage rates, property values, and sales priceslower than California's face a correspondingly high risk of
multiple international taxation. See Container Corp., 463U. S., at 187; cf.

id., at 199-200 (Powell, J., dissenting) (de-scribing how formulary apportionment leads to multiple taxation). Nor do we question that foreign-based multination-als have a higher proportion of such income, on average, than
do their United States counterparts. But Container Corp.'sapproval of this very tax, in the face of a multiple taxation
challenge, did not rest on any insufficiency in the evidencethat multiple taxation might occur; indeed, we accepted in
that case the taxpayer's assertion that multiple taxation infact had occurred.

Id., at 187 ("[T]he tax imposed here, likethe tax in Japan Line, has resulted in actual double taxation,

in the sense that some of the income taxed without appor-tionment by foreign nations as attributable to appellant's foreign subsidiaries was also taxed by California as attributableto the State's share of the total income of the unitary business of which those subsidiaries are a part."); see also id., at187, n. 22.

Container Corp.'s holding on multiple taxation relied ontwo considerations: first, that multiple taxation was not the
"inevitable result" of the California tax; 17 and, second, thatthe "alternativ[e] reasonably available to the taxing State"
(i. e., some version of the separate accounting/"arm's length"

17 The Court stated: "[T]he double taxation in this case, although real,
is not the `inevitabl[e]' result of the California taxing scheme. . . . [W]e are
faced with two distinct methods of allocating the income of a multinational
enterprise. The `arm's-length' approach divides the pie on the basis of
formal accounting principles. The formula apportionment method divides
the same pie on the basis of a mathematical generalization. Whether the
combination of the two methods results in the same income being taxed
twice or in some portion of income not being taxed at all is dependent
solely on the facts of the individual case." Container Corp., 463 U. S., at
188 (citation omitted).

Opinion of the Court
approach), id., at 188-189, "could not eliminate the risk of
double taxation" and might in some cases enhance that risk.
Id., at 191.18 We underscored that "even though most nations have adopted the arm's-length approach in its general
outlines, the precise rules under which they reallocate income among affiliated corporations often differ substantially,
and whenever that difference exists, the possibility of double
taxation also exists." Ibid. (emphasis added); see also id.,
at 192 ("California would have trouble avoiding multiple taxation even if it adopted the `arm's-length' approach . . . .").

These considerations are not dispositively diminished
when California's tax is applied to the components of foreign,
as opposed to domestic, multinationals. Multiple taxation of
such entities because of California's scheme is not "inevitable"; the existence vel non of actual multiple taxation of income remains, as in Container Corp., dependent "on the facts
of the individual case." Id., at 188. And if, as we have held,
adoption of a separate accounting system does not dispositively lessen the risk of multiple taxation of the income
earned by foreign affiliates of domestic-owned corporations,
we see no reason why it would do so in respect of the income
earned by foreign affiliates of foreign-owned corporations.
We refused in Container Corp. "to require California to give
up one allocation method that sometimes results in double
taxation in favor of another allocation method that also
sometimes results in double taxation." Id., at 193. The

18 The Court's decision in Container Corp. effectively modified, for purposes of income taxation, the Commerce Clause multiple taxation inquiry
described in Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434
(1979) (holding unconstitutional application of California's ad valorem
property tax to cargo containers based in Japan and used exclusively in
foreign commerce). In Japan Line, confronting a property tax on containers used as "instrumentalities of [foreign] commerce," not an income
tax on companies, we said that a state tax is incompatible with the Commerce Clause if it "creates a substantial risk of international multiple taxation." Id., at 451.

Opinion of the Court
foreign domicile of the taxpayer (or the taxpayer's parent) isa factor inadequate to warrant retraction of that position.

Recognizing that multiple taxation of international enter-prise may occur whatever taxing scheme the State adopts,
Justice O'Connor, dissenting in No. 92-1384, finds imper-missible under "the [dormant] Foreign Commerce Clause"
only double taxation that (1) burdens a foreign corporationin need of protection for lack of access to the political process, and (2) occurs "because [the State] does not conform tointernational practice."

Post, at 336. But the image of apolitically impotent foreign transactor is surely belied by the

battalion of foreign governments that has marched to Bar-clays' aid, deploring worldwide combined reporting in diplomatic notes, amicus briefs, and even retaliatory legislation.See

infra, at 324, n. 22; post, at 337. Indeed, Californiaresponded to this impressive political activity when it

eliminated mandatory worldwide combined reporting. Seesupra, at 306. In view of this activity, and the control rein
Congress holds, see infra, at 329-331, we cannot agree that"international practice" has such force as to dictate this
Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence. We thereforeadhere to the precedent set in

Container Corp.

B
We turn, finally, to the question ultimately and most ener-getically presented: Did California's worldwide combined reporting requirement, as applied to Barcal, BBI, and Colgate,"impair federal uniformity in an area where federal uniformity is essential," Japan Line, 441 U. S., at 448; in particular,did the State's taxing scheme "preven[t] the Federal Government from `speaking with one voice' in international trade"?Id., at 453, quoting Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U. S.,

at 285. 1

Two decisions principally inform our judgment: first, thisCourt's 1983 determination in Container Corp.; and second,
our decision three years later in Wardair Canada Inc. v.

Opinion of the Court
Florida Dept. of Revenue, 477 U. S. 1 (1986). ContainerCorp. held that California's worldwide combined reporting

requirement, as applied to domestic corporations with for-eign subsidiaries, did not violate the "one voice" standard.
Container Corp. bears on Colgate's case, but not Barcal's orBBI's, to this extent: "[T]he tax [in

Container Corp.] wasimposed, not on a foreign entity . . . , but on a domestic

corporation." 463 U. S., at 195.19 Other factors emphasizedin Container Corp., however, are relevant to the complaints
of all three taxpayers in the consolidated cases now beforeus.

20 Most significantly, the Court found no "specific indications of congressional intent" to preempt California's tax:

"First, there is no claim here that the federal tax stat-utes themselves provide the necessary pre-emptive

force. Second, although the United States is a party toa great number of tax treaties that require the Federal
Government to adopt some form of `arm's-length' analy-sis in taxing the domestic income of multinational enterprises, that requirement is generally waived with re-spect to the taxes imposed by each of the contracting
nations on its own domestic corporations. . . . Third, thetax treaties into which the United States has entered do
not generally cover the taxing activities of subnationalgovernmental units such as States, and in none of the

19 Container Corp. noted:
"We recognize that the fact that legal incidence of a tax falls on a corporation whose formal corporate domicile is domestic might be less significant in the case of a domestic corporation that was owned by foreign interests. We need not decide here whether such a case would require us to
alter our analysis." 463 U. S., at 195, n. 32.

20 Container Corp. observed that "the tax here does not create an automatic `asymmetry' . . . in international taxation," id., at 194-195, quoting
Japan Line, 441 U. S., at 453--i. e., it does not inevitably lead to double
taxation. See supra, at 319-320, and n. 17. Furthermore, Colgate, Barcal, and BBI are "without a doubt amenable to be taxed in California in
one way or another," and "the amount of tax [they] pa[y] is much more
the function of California's tax rate than of its allocation method." 463
U. S., at 195.

treaties does the restriction on `non-arm's-length' meth-ods of taxation apply to the States. Moreover, the Senate has on at least one occasion, in considering a pro-posed treaty, attached a reservation declining to give
its consent to a provision in the treaty that would haveextended that restriction to the States. Finally, . . .
Congress has long debated, but has not enacted, legisla-tion designed to regulate state taxation of income."
Id., at 196-197 (footnotes and internal quotation marksomitted).

The Court again confronted a "one voice" argument in
Wardair Canada Inc. v. Florida Dept. of Revenue, 477 U. S.1 (1986), and there rejected a Commerce Clause challenge to

Florida's tax on the sale of fuel to common carriers, includingairlines. Air carriers were taxed on all aviation fuel purchased in Florida, without regard to the amount the carrierconsumed within the State or the amount of its in-state business. The carrier in Wardair, a Canadian airline that oper-ated charter flights to and from the United States, conceded
that the challenged tax satisfied the Complete Auto criteriaand entailed no threat of multiple international taxation.
Joined by the United States as amicus curiae, however, thecarrier urged that Florida's tax "threaten[ed] the ability of
the Federal Government to `speak with one voice.' " 477U. S., at 9. There is "a federal policy," the carrier asserted,
"of reciprocal tax exemptions for aircraft, equipment, andsupplies, including aviation fuel, that constitute the instrumentalities of international air traffic"; this policy, the car-rier argued, "represents the statement that the `one voice'
of the Federal Government wishes to make," a statement"threatened by [Florida's tax]."

Ibid.This Court disagreed, observing that the proffered evidence disclosed no federal policy of the kind described andindeed demonstrated that the Federal Government intended
to permit the States to impose sales taxes on aviation fuel.The international convention and resolution and more than

70 bilateral treaties on which the carrier relied to show a

323Cite as: 512 U. S. 298 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
United States policy of tax exemption for the instrumentalities of international air traffic, the Court explained, in fact
indicated far less: "[W]hile there appears to be an international aspiration on the one hand to eliminate all impediments to foreign air travel--including taxation of fuel--the
law as it presently stands acquiesces in taxation of the sale
of that fuel by political subdivisions of countries." Id., at
10 (emphasis in original). Most of the bilateral agreements
prohibited the Federal Government from imposing national
taxes on aviation fuel used by foreign carriers, but none prohibited the States or their subdivisions from taxing the sale
of fuel to foreign airlines. The Court concluded that "[b]y
negative implication arising out of [these international accords,] the United States has at least acquiesced in state taxation of fuel used by foreign carriers in international travel,"
and therefore upheld Florida's tax. Id., at 12.

In both Wardair and Container Corp., the Court considered the "one voice" argument only after determining that
the challenged state action was otherwise constitutional.
An important premise underlying both decisions 21 is this:
Congress may more passively indicate that certain state
practices do not "impair federal uniformity in an area where
federal uniformity is essential," Japan Line, 441 U. S., at

448; it need not convey its intent with the unmistakable clarity required to permit state regulation that discriminates
against interstate commerce or otherwise falls short under
Complete Auto inspection. See, e. g., Maine v. Taylor, 477
U. S. 131, 139 (1986) (requiring an "unambiguous indication
of congressional intent" to insulate "otherwise invalid state
legislation" from judicial dormant Commerce Clause scru21 See also Itel Containers Int'l Corp. v. Huddleston, 507 U. S. 60, 75
(1993) (upholding Tennessee's tax on lease of cargo containers used exclusively in international shipping; because tax in question was not among
those proscribed by "various conventions, statutes, and regulations[,] . . .
the most rational inference to be drawn is that th[e] tax, one quite distinct
from the general class of import duties, is permitted").

As in Container Corp. and Wardair, we discern no "specificindications of congressional intent" to bar the state action

here challenged. Our decision upholding California's fran-chise tax in

Container Corp. left the ball in Congress' court;had Congress, the branch responsible for the regulation of

foreign commerce, see U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3, consid-ered nationally uniform use of separate accounting "essential," Japan Line, 441 U. S., at 448, it could have enactedlegislation prohibiting the States from taxing corporate income based on the worldwide combined reporting method.In the 11 years that have elapsed since our decision in

Con-tainer Corp., Congress has failed to enact such legislation.

In the past three decades--both before and after Container Corp.--Congress, aware that foreign governmentswere displeased with States' worldwide combined reporting

requirements,22 has on many occasions studied state taxation

22 The governments of many of our trading partners have expressed
their strong disapproval of California's method of taxation, as demonstrated by the amici briefs in support of Barclays from the Government
of the United Kingdom, and from the Member States of the European
Communities (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain) and the governments
of Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. Barclays has also directed our attention to a series of diplomatic
notes similarly protesting the tax. See, e. g., App. in No. 92-1384, at A-92
to A-123, A-127 to A-128, A-131 to A-138; see also p. A-603 (letter from
Secretary of State George Schultz to California Governor Deukmejian
(Jan. 30, 1986)) ("The Department of State has received diplomatic notes
complaining about state use of the worldwide unitary method of taxation
from virtually every developed country in the world."). The British Parliament has gone further, enacting retaliatory legislation that would, if

tially from sources outside the United States.24 Another setwould have barred the States from requiring taxpayers to

report any income that was not subject to federal incometax;

25 thus, "foreign source income" of foreign corporations

ordinarily would not be reported. See supra, at 306, n. 5.
None of these bills, however, was enacted.

The history of Senate action on a United States/United
Kingdom tax treaty, to which we referred in Container
Corp., see 463 U. S., at 196, reinforces our conclusion that
Congress implicitly has permitted the States to use the
worldwide combined reporting method. As originally negotiated by the President, this treaty--known as the Convention for Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of
Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital
Gains--would have precluded States from requiring that
United Kingdom-controlled corporate taxpayers use combined reporting to compute their state income. See Art.

rejected this version of the treaty, 124 Cong. Rec. 18670
(1978), and ultimately ratified the agreement, id., at 19076,
"subject to the reservation that the provisions of [Article
9(4)] . . . shall not apply to any political subdivision or local
authority of the United States," id., at 18416. The final version of the treaty prohibited state tax discrimination against
British nationals, Art. 2(4), 31 U. S. T. 5671; Art. 24, id., at

Given these indicia of Congress' willingness to tolerate
States' worldwide combined reporting mandates, even when
those mandates are applied to foreign corporations and domestic corporations with foreign parents, we cannot conclude
that "the foreign policy of the United States--whose nuances
. . . are much more the province of the Executive Branch and
Congress than of this Court--is [so] seriously threatened,"

to warrant our intervention.28 For this reason, Barclays'

27 Article 2(4) provides: "For the purpose of Article 24 (Nondiscrimination), this Convention shall also apply to taxes of every kind

method, in the sense that this method is used in computing the federal
income tax liability of multinational corporations," does not render a
State's use of a different method unconstitutional, as the Solicitor General
points out. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 17-18 (emphasis in
original), citing Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes of Vt., 445 U. S.
425, 448 (1980) ("Concurrent federal and state taxation of income, of

Colgate contends that, taken together, these Executive pro-nouncements constitute a "clear federal directive" proscribing States' use of worldwide combined reporting. Brief forPetitioner in No. 92-1839, p. 36, quoting Container Corp., 463

enlist them. The Constitution expressly grants Congress,not the President, the power to "regulate Commerce with

foreign Nations." U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3. As wehave detailed,

supra, at 324-327, and nn. 23-27, Congress
has focused its attention on this issue, but has refrained from
exercising its authority to prohibit state-mandated world-wide combined reporting. That the Executive Branch proposed legislation to outlaw a state taxation practice, but en-countered an unreceptive Congress, is not evidence that the
practice interfered with the Nation's ability to speak withone voice, but is rather evidence that the preeminent speaker
decided to yield the floor to others. Cf. Itel Containers Int'l
Corp. v. Huddleston, 507 U. S. 60, 81 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ("[The President] is better able to decide than we are which state regula-tory interests should currently be subordinated to our

national interest in foreign commerce. Under the Constitution, however, neither he nor we were to make that decision,
but only Congress.").

Congress may "delegate very large grants of its power
over foreign commerce to the President," who "also possesses in his own right certain powers conferred by the Constitution on him as Commander-in-Chief and as the Nation's
organ in foreign affairs." Chicago & Southern Air Lines,
Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 109 (1948). We

tions--press releases, letters, and amicus briefs--on whichColgate here relies are merely precatory. Executive Branch

communications that express federal policy but lack the forceof law cannot render unconstitutional California's otherwise
valid, congressionally condoned, use of worldwide combined
reporting.32 * * *

The Constitution does " `not make the judiciary the overseer of our government.' " Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453U. S. 654, 660 (1981), quoting

Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v.
Sawyer, 343 U. S., at 594 (Frankfurter, J., concurring). Having determined that the taxpayers before us had an adequate
nexus with the State, that worldwide combined reporting led
to taxation which was fairly apportioned, nondiscriminatory,
fairly related to the services provided by the State, and that
its imposition did not result inevitably in multiple taxation,

32 The Solicitor General suggests that when a court analyzes "whether a
state tax impairs the federal government's ability to speak with one voice
. . . the statements of executive branch officials are entitled to substantial
evidentiary weight," Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19, but he
argues that the constitutionality of a State's taxing practice must be assessed according to the federal policy, if any, in effect at the time the
challenged taxes were assessed. He asserts that federal officials had not
articulated a policy opposing use by the States of worldwide combined
reporting prior to the mid-1980's, and urges the Court to affirm the judgments below on the ground that California's use of worldwide combined
reporting was not unconstitutional during the years here at issue, even if
it became unconstitutional in later years (a question on which he takes no
position, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 38-41). Colgate, on the other hand, suggests
that the relevant time frame is "when the tax is definitively enforced by
the state taxing authority, through judicial proceedings if necessary, not
when the tax technically accrues under state law," Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 92-1839, p. 7, and argues in the alternative that a federal
policy opposing combined worldwide reporting had been established as of
1970-1973, id., at 9. We need not resolve this dispute, because we have
concluded that the Executive statements criticizing States' use of worldwide combined reporting do not, in light of Congress' acquiescence in the
States' actions, authorize judicial intervention here.

we leave it to Congress--whose voice, in this area, is theNation's--to evaluate whether the national interest is best

served by tax uniformity, or state autonomy. Accordingly,the judgments of the California Court of Appeal are

Affirmed.
Justice Blackmun, concurring.
Last Term, in Itel Containers Int'l Corp. v. Huddleston,507 U. S. 60, 85 (1993) (

Blackmun, J., dissenting), I ex-pressed my disagreement with the Court's willingness, in

applying the "one voice" test, to "infe[r] permission for [a]tax from Congress' supposed failure to prohibit it." See also
Wardair Canada Inc. v. Florida Dept. of Revenue, 477 U. S.1, 18 (1986) (

Blackmun, J., dissenting). I accordingly wouldnot rely in the present cases on congressional inaction to

conclude that "Congress implicitly has permitted the Statesto use the worldwide combined reporting method." Ante,
at 326. Nevertheless, because today's holding largely is con-trolled by

Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Bd.,463 U. S. 159 (1983), and because California's corporate franchise tax does not directly burden the instrumentalities offoreign commerce, see Itel, supra; Wardair, supra; and
Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434(1979), I agree that the tax does not "impair federal uniformity in an area where federal uniformity is essential," id., at448. I therefore join the opinion of the Court.

Justice Scalia, concurring in part and concurring in thejudgment.

and concurring in judgment), "I will enforce a self-executing,`negative' Commerce Clause in two circumstances: (1)

against a state law that facially discriminates against inter-state [or foreign] commerce, and (2) against a state law that
is indistinguishable from a type of law previously held unconstitutional by this Court." Id., at 78-79 (footnote omitted).Absent one of these circumstances, I will permit the States

to employ whatever means of taxation they choose insofar asthe Commerce Clause is concerned. Neither circumstance
exists here, and the California tax therefore survives Com-merce Clause attack.

I am not sure that the Court's opinion today, which re-quires no more than legislative inaction to establish that
"Congress implicitly has permitted" the States to impose a
particular restriction on foreign commerce, ante, at 326, will
prove much different from my approach in its consequences.
It is, moreover, an unquestionable improvement over Itel:
whereas the "speak with one voice" analysis of that opinion
gave the power to determine the constitutionality of a state
law to the Executive Branch, see 507 U. S., at 80 (Scalia, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment), today's opinion restores the power to Congress--albeit in a form that
strangely permits it to be exercised by silence.

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Thomas joins,
concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.

I joined Justice Powell in dissent in Container Corp. of
America v. Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U. S. 159 (1983), and I
continue to think the Court erred in upholding California's
use of worldwide combined reporting in taxing the income
of a domestic-based corporate group. But because the State
and private parties have justifiably relied on the constitutionality of taxing such corporations, and Congress has not
seen fit to override our decision, I agree with the Court that
Container Corp. should not be overruled, cf. Quill Corp. v.
North Dakota, 504 U. S. 298, 318-319 (1992), and that it

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
resolves the constitutional challenge raised by Colgate-Palmolive. I therefore concur in the judgment in No. 92-

1839. Barclays Bank, on the other hand, is a foreign-basedparent company of a multinational corporate group, and our
holding in Container Corp. expressly does not extend to this
situation. See 463 U. S., at 189, n. 26, and 195, n. 32. In myview, the California tax cannot constitutionally be applied

to foreign corporations. I therefore respectfully dissent inNo. 92-1384.

A state tax on interstate commerce must meet four re-quirements under our negative Commerce Clause precedents: the tax must be on an activity with a substantial
nexus to the taxing State, it must be fairly apportioned, it
must not discriminate against interstate commerce, and it
must be fairly related to the services provided by the State.
Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274, 279
(1977). Substantially for the reasons explained by the
Court, see ante, at 311-314, I agree that imposition of the
California tax complies with the four Complete Auto factors.
(I also agree that California's practice of accepting "reasonable approximations" of the statutorily required financial
data does not violate due process. See ante, at 314-316.)
A state tax on foreign commerce, however, must satisfy two
additional inquiries: "first, whether the tax, notwithstanding
apportionment, creates a substantial risk of international
multiple taxation, and, second, whether the tax prevents the
Federal Government from `speaking with one voice when
regulating commercial relations with foreign governments.'
If a state tax contravenes either of these precepts, it is
unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause." Japan Line,
Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434, 451 (1979) (emphasis added).

I am in general agreement with the Court, see ante, at
320-329, that the second Japan Line factor--the purported
need for federal uniformity--does not prevent the use of
worldwide combined reporting in taxing foreign corpora512us2$79J 01-08-98 12:24:50 PAGES OPINPGT

tions. The Congress, not the Executive or the Judiciary, hasbeen given the power to regulate commerce. U. S. Const.,

Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3. The Legislature has neither approved nordisapproved the California tax. Although in such circumstances courts have the power to scrutinize taxes for consistency with our negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence,this determination should be made on the basis of the objective factors outlined in Complete Auto (and, in the foreigncommerce context, the multiple taxation analysis discussed
in Japan Line), not statements made and briefs filed by offi-cials in the Executive Branch. Cf.

Itel Containers Int'l
Corp. v. Huddleston, 507 U. S. 60, 80-81 (1993) (Scalia, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Indeed,
the inconsistent positions taken by the Solicitor General in
the course of Barclays' challenge to the California tax illustrate the perils of resting constitutional determinations on
such "evidence." Compare Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 21-24 (arguing that the California tax was constitutionally applied to Barclays during the tax years in question), with Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in
Barclays Bank v. Franchise Tax Board, O. T. 1992, No. 92-
212, pp. 9-16 (arguing that the imposition of the California
tax on Barclays was unconstitutional).

But I cannot agree with the Court's resolution of the other
Japan Line factor--the need to avoid international multiple taxation. See ante, at 316-320. Barclays does 98% of
its business in countries other than the United States. California, through application of worldwide combined reporting, taxes some of that income. The trial court found as
a fact that "[t]here is a definite risk of, as well as actual
double taxation here." App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 92-1384,
p. A-25. This double taxation occurs because California has
adopted a taxing system that is inconsistent with the taxing
method used by foreign taxing authorities. California's formula assigns a higher proportion of income to jurisdictions
where wage rates, property values, and sales prices are

335Cite as: 512 U. S. 298 (1994)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
higher; to the extent that California is such a jurisdiction(and it usually will be) the formula inherently leads to double

taxation. And whenever the three factors are higher in Cal-ifornia, the State will tax income under its formula that
already has been taxed by another country under accepted
international practice.In

Container Corp., we recognized that the California tax
"ha[d] resulted in actual double taxation . . . stem[ming] froma serious divergence in the taxing schemes adopted by California and the foreign taxing authorities," and that "the tax-ing method adopted by those foreign taxing authorities is
consistent with accepted international practice." 463 U. S.,
at 187. We nevertheless held that the tax did not violate
the Japan Line principle. Two of the factors on which we
relied--that the tax was on income rather than property, and
that the multiple taxation was not "inevitable"--carry no
more force today than they did 11 Terms ago, see 463 U. S.,
at 198-201 (Powell, J., dissenting), but they are present here
as well.

We also relied on a third ground to distinguish the tax
upheld in Container Corp. from the tax invalidated in Japan
Line: "[T]he tax here falls, not on the foreign owners of an
instrumentality of foreign commerce, but on a corporation
domiciled and headquartered in the United States. We specifically left open in Japan Line the application of that case
to `domestically owned instrumentalities engaged in foreign
commerce,' and . . . this case falls clearly within that reservation." 463 U. S., at 188-189, quoting Japan Line, supra, at
444, n. 7 (citation omitted). In a footnote, we continued: "We
have no need to address in this opinion the constitutionality
of [the California tax] with respect to state taxation of domestic corporations with foreign parents or foreign corporations with either foreign parents or foreign subsidiaries."
463 U. S., at 189, n. 26; see also id., at 195, and n. 32. As the
Court recognizes, ante, at 317, and n. 15, Barclays' challenge
to the California tax therefore presents the question we ex512us2$79J 01-08-98 12:24:50 PAGES OPINPGT
336 BARCLAYS BANK PLC v. FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
pressly left open in Container Corp.: does it make a constitu-tional difference that the multiple taxation resulting from

California's use of worldwide combined reporting falls ona foreign corporation rather than a domestic one? In my
view, the answer is yes.

Japan Line teaches that where the instrumentality ofcommerce--and analogously, the corporate domicile--is foreign, the multiple taxation resulting from a state taxingscheme may violate the Commerce Clause even though the
same tax would be constitutional as applied to a domesticcorporation. 441 U. S., at 447-448. When worldwide combined reporting is applied to American corporate groups
with foreign affiliates, as in Container Corp., income attributable to those foreign companies will be taxed by California,
even though they are also subject to tax in foreign countries.
But in such cases the incidence of the tax falls on the domestic parent corporation--a corporation subject to full taxation
in the United States notwithstanding the source of its income. When the California tax is applied to a foreign corporate group with both domestic and foreign affiliates, some of
the income of the foreign companies will also be taxed by
California. The incidence of the tax in such cases falls on a
foreign corporation, even though the United States (and its
subnational governments) is entitled to tax only the income
earned domestically.

In my view, the States are prohibited (absent express congressional authorization) by the Foreign Commerce Clause
from adopting a system of taxation that, because it does not
conform to international practice, results in multiple taxation of foreign corporations. It may be that such a rule
"leave[s] California free to discriminate against a Delaware
corporation in favor of an overseas corporation," Container
Corp., 463 U. S., at 203 (Powell, J., dissenting), but the reason
for this differential treatment is obvious. Domestic taxpayers have access to the political process, at both the state and
national levels, that foreign taxpayers simply do not enjoy.

337Cite as: 512 U. S. 298 (1994)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
If California's tax results in intolerable double taxation ofdomestic corporations, those companies can seek redress

through the normal channels. Cf. Minnesota v. Clover Leaf
Creamery Co., 449 U. S. 456, 473, n. 17 (1981); Raymond
Motor Transp., Inc. v. Rice, 434 U. S. 429, 444, n. 18 (1978).
It is all too easy, however, for the state legislature to fill theState's coffers at the expense of outsiders.

Most of the United States' trading partners have objectedto California's use of worldwide combined reporting. See
De' marche from Danish Embassy, on behalf of Governmentsof European Community (Mar. 26, 1993) ("The views of the
EC Member States on worldwide unitary taxation are well
known to the United States Government. All Member
States have expressed their strong opposition to [the California] tax in a number of diplomatic communiques to the
United States Government from 1980 to the present date");
De' marche from Belgian Embassy, on behalf of Governments
of Member States of European Community and of Australia,
Austria, Canada, Finland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland (Sept. 23, 1993). At least one country has already
enacted retaliatory legislation. See Brief for Government
of United Kingdom as Amicus Curiae 19-23. Moreover, the
possibility of multiple taxation undoubtedly deters foreign
investment in this country. See Brief for Member States
of European Communities et al. as Amici Curiae 14-16.
These adverse consequences, which affect the Nation as a
whole, result solely from California's refusal to conform its
taxing practices to the internationally accepted standard.

Unlike the Court, see ante, at 319, I would not dismiss these
difficulties solely by relying on our observation in Container
Corp. that "it would be perverse, simply for the sake of
avoiding double taxation, to require California to give up one
allocation method that sometimes results in double taxation
in favor of another allocation method that also sometimes
results in double taxation." 463 U. S., at 193. In addition
to being factually incorrect, see id., at 199, n. 1 (Powell, J.,

512us2$79J 01-08-98 12:24:50 PAGES OPINPGT
338 BARCLAYS BANK PLC v. FRANCHISE TAX BD. OF CAL.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
dissenting), our discussion of alternatives in Container Corp.proceeded from the well-established proposition that States

need not conform their taxing practices to those of theirneighbors, at least so far as domestic commerce is concerned.
See, e. g., Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U. S. 267, 277-281
(1978). Multiple taxation of domestic companies is avoided,to the extent necessary, by the fair apportionment requirement. See Container Corp., supra, at 185; General Motors
Corp. v. Washington, 377 U. S. 436, 440 (1964).

But in Japan Line we squarely rejected the argument thatthe same principle applies to taxes imposed on foreignowned instrumentalities:

"[N]either this Court nor this Nation can ensure full apportionment when one of the taxing entities is a foreignsovereign. If an instrumentality of commerce is domiciled abroad, the country of domicile may have the right,consistently with the custom of nations, to impose a tax
on its full value. If a State should seek to tax the same
instrumentality on an apportioned basis, multiple taxa-tion inevitably results. . . . Due to the absence of an

authoritative tribunal capable of ensuring that the ag-gregation of taxes is computed on no more than one full
value, a state tax, even though `fairly apportioned' toreflect an instrumentality's presence within the State,
may subject foreign commerce to the risk of a doubletax burden to which [domestic] commerce is not
exposed, and which the commerce clause forbids." 441
U. S., at 447-448 (footnote and internal quotationmarks omitted).

In my view, the risk of multiple taxation created by California's use of worldwide combined reporting--a risk that
has materialized with respect to Barclays--is sufficient to
render the California tax constitutionally infirm. I therefore respectfully dissent from the Court's conclusion to the
contrary.

when trial does not occur within the time prescribed, Article V(c). Petitioner Reed was transferred in April 1983 from a federal prison in Indiana to state custody pursuant to an IAD detainer lodged by Indiana
officials. Trial on the state charges was originally set for a date 19
days beyond the 120-day IAD period and was subsequently postponed
for an additional 35 days. Although Reed's many and wide-ranging
pretrial motions contained a few general references to the IAD time
limit, he did not specifically object to his trial date until four days after
the 120-day period expired. The trial court denied Reed's petition for
discharge on the grounds that the judge had previously been unaware
of the 120-day limitation and that Reed had not earlier objected to the
trial date or requested a speedier trial. Reed then successfully moved
for a continuance to enable him to prepare his defense. After his trial
and conviction in October 1983, Reed unsuccesfully pursued an appeal
and sought postconviction relief in Indiana's courts. He then petitioned
for a federal writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254. The District Court denied relief, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
984 F. 2d 209, affirmed.

Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court with respect
to Parts I, III, and all but the final paragraph of Part IV, concluding
that a state court's failure to observe IAD Article IV(c)'s 120-day rule
is not cognizable under $ 2254 when the defendant registered no objection to the trial date at the time it was set, and suffered no prejudice
attributable to the delayed commencement. Because Reed failed to
make the requisite showing of prejudice, he cannot tenably maintain
that his Sixth Amendment speedy trial right was violated. See Barker
v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514, 530. Reed's petition is properly considered
under the "fundamental defect" standard set forth in Hill v. United

Syllabus
States, 368 U. S. 424, 428. Reed urges that the Hill standard applies
only to federal prisoners under $ 2255, not to state prisoners under

$ 2254. This Court's decisions have recognized, however, that, at least
where only statutory violations are at issue, $$ 2254 and 2255 mirror
each other in operative effect, see Davis v. United States, 417 U. S. 333,
344; Hill controls collateral review--under both $$ 2254 and 2255--when
a federal statute, but not the Constitution, is the basis for the postconviction attack. See, e. g., Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 477, n. 10. There
is no reason to afford habeas review to a state prisoner like Reed, who
let a time clock run without alerting the trial court, yet deny collateral
review to a federal prisoner similarly situated. Pp. 341-346, 353-355.

Justice Ginsburg, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice
O'Connor, concluded in Part II and the final paragraph of Part IV that
habeas review is not available to check the trial court's failure to comply
with Article IV(c). That failure does not qualify as a "fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice, [o]r an
omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure."
Hill, 368 U. S., at 428. When a defendant obscures Article IV(c)'s time
prescription and avoids clear objection until the clock has run, an unwitting judicial slip of the kind involved here ranks with similar nonconstitutional lapses that are not cognizable in a postconviction proceeding.
See, e. g., id., at 429. Because Reed did not alert the trial judge to the
120-day period until four days after the period expired, the Court has
no cause to consider whether an omission of the kind contemplated in
Hill would occur if a state court, presented with a timely request to set
a trial date within the IAD's 120-day period, nonetheless refused to
comply with Article IV(c). The reservation of that question, together
with the IAD's status as both federal law and the law of Indiana, mutes
Reed's concern that state courts might be hostile to the federal law here
at stake. Pp. 347-352, 355.

Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, agreed that the "fundamental defect" test of Hill v. United States, 368 U. S. 424, 428, is the
appropriate standard for evaluating alleged statutory violations under
both $$ 2254 and 2255, but concluded that the standard's application is
broader than the principal opinion suggests. The class of nonconstitutional procedural rights that are inherently necessary to avoid "a complete miscarriage of justice," or numbered among "the rudimentary demands of fair procedure," is no doubt a small one, if it is not a null set.
If there was ever a technical rule, it is the 120-day limit set forth in
Article IV(c) of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. Declining to
state the obvious produces confusion: Violation of that technicality,
whether intentional or unintentional, is no basis for federal habeas
relief. Pp. 355-358.

having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary orreasonable continuance." IAD Article V(c) states that when

trial does not occur within the time prescribed, the chargesshall be dismissed with prejudice.

The petitioner in this case, Orrin Scott Reed, was trans-ferred in April 1983 from a federal prison in Indiana to state
custody pursuant to an IAD request made by Indiana offi-cials. Reed was tried in October of that year, following
postponements made and explained in his presence in opencourt. Reed's petition raises the question whether a state
prisoner, asserting a violation of IAD Article IV(c)'s 120-daylimitation, may enforce that speedy trial prescription in a
federal habeas corpus action under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254.We hold that a state court's failure to observe the 120-day
rule of IAD Article IV(c) is not cognizable under $ 2254 whenthe defendant registered no objection to the trial date at the
time it was set, and suffered no prejudice attributable to thedelayed commencement. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

I
In December 1982, while petitioner Reed was servingtime in a Terre Haute, Indiana, federal prison, the State of

Indiana charged him with theft and habitual offender status.Indiana authorities lodged a detainer

1 against Reed and, on

April 27, 1983, took custody of him. The 120-day rule ofIAD Article IV(c) thus instructed that, absent any continuance, Reed's trial was to commence on or before August25, 1983.

At two pretrial conferences, one on June 27, the other onAugust 1, the trial judge discussed with Reed (who chose to
represent himself) and the prosecutor the number of daysneeded for the trial and the opening date. At the June 27

1 A detainer is "a request filed by a criminal justice agency with the
institution in which a prisoner is incarcerated, asking . . . either to hold
the prisoner for the agency or to notify the agency when release of the
prisoner is imminent." Carchman v. Nash, 473 U. S. 716, 719 (1985).

Opinion of the Court
conference, the court set a July 18 deadline for submissionof the many threshold motions Reed said he wished to file,

and September 13 as the trial date. That trial date ex-ceeded IAD Article IV(c)'s 120-day limit, but neither the
prosecutor nor Reed called the IAD limit to the attention ofthe judge, and neither asked for a different trial date. Reed
did indicate a preference for trial at a time when he wouldbe out of jail on bond (or on his own recognizance); he informed the court that he would be released from federalcustody two weeks before September 13, unless federal
authorities revoked his "good days" credits, in which casehe would be paroled on September 14. App. 39; see

id.,at 76.

At the August 1 pretrial conference, Reed noted his immi-nent release from federal custody and asked the court to set
bond. Id., at 76-79. In response, the court set bond at$25,000. Also, because of a calendar conflict, the court reset
the trial date to September 19. Id., at 79-81.2 Reed in-quired about witness subpoenas and requested books on procedure, but again, he said nothing at the conference to alertthe judge to Article IV(c)'s 120-day limit, nor did he express
any other objection to the September 19 trial date.Interspersed in Reed's many written and oral pretrial motions are references to IAD provisions other than ArticleIV(c). See

id., at 28-31, 44 (alleging illegality of transferfrom federal to state custody without a pretransfer hearing);

id., at 46 (asserting failure to provide hygienic care in viola-tion of IAD Article V). Reed did refer to the IAD prescription on trial commencement in three of the written motionshe filed during the 120-day period; indeed, one of these motions was filed on the very day of the August 1 pretrial con-ference.

3 In none of the three motions, however, did Reed

mention Article IV(c) or the September 13 trial date pre-viously set. In contrast, on August 29, four days after the

120-day period expired, Reed presented a clear statementand citation. In a "Petition for Discharge," he alleged that
Indiana had failed to try him within 120 days of his transferto state custody, and therefore had violated Article IV(c);

4

consequently, he urged, the IAD mandated his immediaterelease.

5 The trial judge denied the petition, explaining:

"Today is the first day I was aware that there was a120 day limitation on the Detainer Act. The Court

made its setting and while there has been a request formoving the trial forward, there has not been any speedy
trial request filed, nor has there been anything in thenature of an objection to the trial setting, but only an
urging that it be done within the guidelines that havebeen set out."

Id., at 113-114.

The morning trial was to commence, September 19, Reedfiled a motion for continuance, saying he needed additional

time for trial preparation. Id., at 128. A newspaper articlepublished two days earlier had listed the names of persons

as set forth in the [IAD]"); Petition for Revision of Pre-trial Procedure
and Relief of Violations (filed Aug. 1, 1983), id., at 88 (seeking dismissal of
charges, referring, inter alia, to "the limited time left for trial within the
laws"); Petition for Subpoena for Depositions upon Oral Examination, and
for Production of Documentary Evidence (filed Aug. 11, 1983), id., at 91
(requesting action "as soon as possible due to approaching trial date and
Detainer Act time limits").

4 Id., at 94. Specifically, Reed wrote: "That petitioner is being detained

contrary to Indiana law and procedure: 35-33-10-4, Article 4(c) . . . trial
shall be commenced within one hundred twenty (120) days of arrival of
the prisoner in the receiving state . . . ."

5 The prosecutor, in response, pointed out that Article IV(c) permits

"any necessary or reasonable continuance," and that Reed had not objected at the time the trial court set the date. Id., at 113. He also expressed confusion about the effect of the 120-day rule and its relationship
to the 180-day time limit prescribed by a different IAD provision. Id., at
114; see n. 6, infra.

Opinion of the Court
called for jury duty and the 1954 to 1980 time frame of Reed'salleged prior felony convictions. Concerned that the article

might jeopardize the fairness of the trial, the judge offeredReed three options: (1) start the trial on schedule; (2) postpone it for one week; or (3) continue it to a late October date.
Reed chose the third option, id., at 134, 142, and the trialbegan on October 18; the jury convicted Reed of theft, and

found him a habitual offender. He received a sentence of 4years in prison on the theft conviction, and 30 years on the
habitual offender conviction, the terms to run consecutively.The Indiana Supreme Court affirmed the convictions.
Reed v. State, 491 N. E. 2d 182 (1986). Concerning Reed's
objection that the trial commenced after the 120-day period
specified in IAD Article IV(c), the Indiana Supreme Court
stressed the timing of Reed's pleas in court: Reed had vigorously urged at the August 1 pretrial conference other alleged
IAD violations (particularly, his asserted right to a hearing
in advance of the federal transfer to state custody), but he
did not then object to the trial date. Id., at 184-185; see
App. 67-74. "The relevant times when [Reed] should have
objected were on June 27, 1983, the date the trial was set,
and August 1, 1983, the date the trial was reset," the Indiana
Supreme Court concluded. 491 N. E. 2d, at 185.

Reed unsuccessfully sought postconviction relief in the Indiana courts, and then petitioned under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 for
a federal writ of habeas corpus. The District Court denied
the petition. Examining the record, that court concluded
that "a significant amount of the delay of trial is attributable
to the many motions filed . . . by [Reed] or filed on [Reed's]
behalf "; delay chargeable to Reed, the court held, was
excludable from the 120-day period. Reed v. Clark, Civ.
No. S 90-226 (ND Ind., Sept. 21, 1990), App. 195-196.

The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.
Reed v. Clark, 984 F. 2d 209 (1993). Preliminarily, the Court

of Appeals recognized that the IAD, although state law, is
also a "law of the United States" within the meaning of

346 REED v. FARLEY

Opinion of the Court

$ 2254(a). Id., at 210. Nonetheless, that court held collat-eral relief unavailable because Reed's IAD speedy trial arguments and remedial contentions had been considered andrejected by the Indiana courts. Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S.
465 (1976), the Court of Appeals concluded, "establishes
the proper framework for evaluating claims under the IAD."984 F. 2d, at 213. In

Stone, this Court held that the exclusionary rule, devised to promote police respect for theFourth Amendment rights of suspects, should not be applied

on collateral review unless the state court failed to considerthe defendant's arguments. We granted certiorari, 510 U. S.
963 (1993), to resolve a conflict among the Courts of Appealson the availability of habeas review of IAD speedy trial
claims.6

6 The IAD's other speedy trial provision, Article III(a), requires that a
prisoner against whom a detainer has been lodged be tried within 180
days of the prosecuting State's receipt of the prisoner's notice requesting
speedy disposition of the charges. Fex v. Michigan, 507 U. S. 43 (1993).

The Seventh Circuit's rationale is one of several approaches taken by
Courts of Appeals addressing the availability of habeas review for violations of Articles IV(c) and III(a). Some courts have denied relief without
regard to whether the petitioner alerted the trial court to the IAD's
speedy trial provisions. In this category, some decisions state that IAD
speedy trial claims are never cognizable under $ 2254, because IAD speedy
trial violations do not constitute a "fundamental defect which inherently
results in a complete miscarriage of justice," under Hill v. United States,
368 U. S. 424, 428 (1962). See, e. g., Reilly v. Warden, FCI Petersburg,
947 F. 2d 43, 44-45 (CA2 1991) (per curiam); Fasano v. Hall, 615 F. 2d
555, 558-559 (CA1 1980). Other courts applying the Hill standard have
said $ 2254 is not available for failure to meet IAD speedy trial specifications unless the petitioner shows actual prejudice. See, e. g., Seymore v.
Alabama, 846 F. 2d 1355, 1359-1360 (CA11 1988); Kerr v. Finkbeiner, 757
F. 2d 604, 607 (CA4 1985). Still other courts have reached the merits of
IAD speedy trial contentions raised in habeas actions under $ 2254. See,
e. g., Birdwell v. Skeen, 983 F. 2d 1332 (CA5 1993) (affirming District
Court's grant of the writ, where state court failed to comply with IAD
Article III(a) in spite of petitioner's repeated request for compliance with
the 180-day rule); Cody v. Morris, 623 F. 2d 101, 103 (CA9 1980) (remanding to District Court for resolution of factual dispute over whether habeas

A state prisoner may obtain federal habeas corpus relief
"only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of theConstitution or

laws or treaties of the United States." 28
U. S. C. $ 2254(a) (emphasis added). Respondent Indiana ini-tially argues that the IAD is a voluntary interstate agreement, not a "la[w] . . . of the United States" within the mean-ing of $ 2254(a). Our precedent, however, has settled that
issue: While the IAD is indeed state law, it is a law of theUnited States as well. See

Carchman v. Nash, 473 U. S.
716, 719 (1985) ($ 2254 case, holding that the IAD "is a
congressionally sanctioned interstate compact within the
Compact Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 10, cl. 3, and thus
is a federal law subject to federal construction"); Cuyler v.
Adams, 449 U. S. 433, 438-442 (1981) ("congressional consent
transforms an interstate compact . . . into a law of the
United States").

The Court of Appeals recognized that the IAD is both a
law of Indiana and a federal statute. 984 F. 2d, at 210.
Adopting Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465 (1976), as its framework, however, that court held relief under $ 2254 unavailable to Reed. 984 F. 2d, at 213. Stone holds that a federal
court may not, under $ 2254, consider a claim that evidence
from an unconstitutional search was introduced at a state
prisoner's trial if the prisoner had "an opportunity for full
and fair litigation of [the] claim in the state courts." 428
U. S., at 469. Our opinion in Stone concentrated on "the
nature and purpose of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary
rule." Id., at 481. The Court emphasized that its decision
confined the exclusionary rule, not the scope of $ 2254
generally:

petitioner had been tried within Article IV(c)'s 120-day limit); United
States ex rel. Esola v. Groomes, 520 F. 2d 830, 839 (CA3 1975) (remanding
to District Court for determination on whether state trial court had
granted continuance for good cause pursuant to Article IV(c)).

348 REED v. FARLEY

Opinion of Ginsburg, J.
"Our decision today is not concerned with the scope ofthe habeas corpus statute as authority for litigating constitutional claims generally. We do reaffirm that theexclusionary rule is a judicially created remedy rather
than a personal constitutional right, . . . and we empha-size the minimal utility of the rule when sought to be
applied to Fourth Amendment claims in a habeas corpusproceeding."

Id., at 495, n. 37 (emphasis in original).

We have "repeatedly declined to extend the rule in Stonebeyond its original bounds."

Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S.680, 687 (1993) (holding that Stone does not apply to a state

prisoner's claim that his conviction rests on statements ob-tained in violation of the safeguards set out in Miranda v.
Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966)).7 Because precedent alreadyin place suffices to resolve Reed's case, we do not adopt the
Seventh Circuit's Stone-based rationale.We have stated that habeas review is available to check
violations of federal laws when the error qualifies as "a fun-damental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice [or] an omission inconsistent with the rudi-mentary demands of fair procedure." Hill v. United States,
368 U. S. 424, 428 (1962); accord, United States v. Timmreck,441 U. S. 780, 783 (1979);

Davis v. United States, 417 U. S.333, 346 (1974). The IAD's purpose--providing a nationally

uniform means of transferring prisoners between jurisdic-tions--can be effectuated only by nationally uniform interpretation. See 984 F. 2d, at 214 (Ripple, J., dissenting fromdenial of rehearing in banc). Therefore, the argument that

the compact would be undermined if a State's courts resisted
steadfast enforcement, with total insulation from $ 2254 review, is not without force. Cf. Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S., at
526 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (institutional constraints preclude Supreme Court from overseeing adequately whether
state courts have properly applied federal law). This case,
however, gives us no cause to consider whether we would
confront an omission of the kind contemplated in Hill,
Timmreck, or Davis, if a state court, presented with a timely
request to set a trial date within the IAD's 120-day period,
nonetheless refused to comply with Article IV(c).

When a defendant obscures Article IV(c)'s time prescription and avoids clear objection until the clock has run, cause
for collateral review scarcely exists. An unwitting judicial
slip of the kind involved here ranks with the nonconstitutional lapses we have held not cognizable in a postconviction
proceeding. In Hill, for example, a federal prisoner sought
collateral relief, under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255,8 based on the trial
court's failure at sentencing to afford him an opportunity to
make a statement and present information in mitigation of
punishment, as required by Rule 32(a) of the Federal Rules
of Criminal Procedure. The petitioner, however, had not
sought to assert his Rule 32(a) rights at the time of sentencing, a point we stressed:

"[W]e are not dealing here with a case where the defendant was affirmatively denied an opportunity to
speak during the hearing at which his sentence was
imposed. Nor is it suggested that in imposing the
sentence the District Judge was either misinformed or
uninformed as to any relevant circumstances. Indeed,
there is no claim that the defendant would have had
anything at all to say if he had been formally invited
to speak." 368 U. S., at 429.

Opinion of Ginsburg, J.
"[W]hen all that is shown is a failure to comply with the
formal requirements" of Rule 32(a), we held, "collateral relief
is not available." Ibid. But we left open the question
whether "[collateral] relief would be available if a violation
of Rule 32(a) occurred in the context of other aggravating
circumstances." Ibid.

Hill controlled our decision in United States v. Timmreck,
441 U. S. 780 (1979), where a federal prisoner sought collateral review, under $ 2255, to set aside a conviction based on
a guilty plea. The complainant in Timmreck alleged that
the judge who accepted his plea failed to inform him, in violation of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,
that he faced a mandatory postincarceration special parole
term. We rejected the collateral attack, observing that the
violation of Rule 11 was technical, and did not "resul[t] in
a `complete miscarriage of justice' or in a proceeding `inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.' "
Id., at 784, quoting Hill, 368 U. S., at 428. "As in Hill," we
found it unnecessary to consider whether "[postconviction]
relief would be available if a violation of Rule 11 occurred in
the context of other aggravating circumstances." 441 U. S.,
at 784-785.

Reed's case similarly lacks "aggravating circumstances"
rendering " `the need for the remedy afforded by the writ of
habeas corpus . . . apparent.' " Hill, 368 U. S., at 428, quoting Bowen v. Johnston, 306 U. S. 19, 27 (1939). Reed had
two clear chances to alert the trial judge in open court if he
indeed wanted his trial to start on or before August 25, 1993.
He let both opportunities pass by. At the pretrial hearings
at which the trial date was set and rescheduled, on June 27
and August 1, Reed not only failed to mention the 120-day
limit; he indicated a preference for holding the trial after his
release from federal imprisonment, which was due to occur
after the 120 days expired. See supra, at 342. Then, on

As the Court of Appeals observed, had Reed objected tothe trial date on June 27 or August 1 "instead of burying his

demand in a flood of other documents, the [trial] court couldhave complied with the IAD's requirements." 984 F. 2d, at
209-210. The Court of Appeals further elaborated:

"During the pretrial conference of August 1, 1983, Reedpresented several arguments based on the IAD, including claims that the federal government should have helda hearing before turning him over to the state and that
his treatment in Indiana fell short of the state's obliga-tions under Art. V(d) and (h). Reed did not mention
the fact that the date set for trial would fall outside the120 days allowed by Art. IV(c). Courts often require
litigants to flag important issues orally rather than buryvital (and easily addressed) problems in reams of paper,
as Reed did. E. g., Fed. R. Crim. P. 30 (requiring a distinct objection to jury instructions); cf. Fed. R. Crim. P.12(b) (a district judge may require motions to be made

orally). It would not have been difficult for the judgeto advance the date of the trial or make a finding on
the record of good cause, either of which would havesatisfied Art. IV(c). Because the subject never came
up, however, the trial judge overlooked the problem."
Id., at 213.

Reed regards the Court of Appeals' description of his liti-gation conduct, even if true, as irrelevant. He maintains

period's expiration. See infra, at 353.

352 REED v. FARLEY

Opinion of the Court
that the IAD dictates the result we must reach, for ArticleV(c) directs dismissal with prejudice when Article IV(c)'s

time limit has passed.10 Article V(c) instructs only that "theappropriate court of the jurisdiction where the indictment
. . . has been pending"--i. e., the original trial court--shalldismiss the charges if trial does not commence within the
time Article IV(c) prescribes. Article V(c) does not addressthe discrete question whether relief for violations of the
IAD's speedy trial provisions is available on collateral re-view. That matter is governed instead by the principles and
precedent generally controlling availability of the great writ.See

id., at 212. Referring to those guides, and particularlythe
Hill and Timmreck decisions, we conclude that a statecourt's failure to observe the 120-day rule of IAD Article

IV(c) is not cognizable under $ 2254 when the defendantregistered no objection to the trial date at the time it was
set, and suffered no prejudice attributable to the delayedcommencement.

III
Reed argues that he is entitled to habeas relief becausethe IAD's speedy trial provision "effectuates a constitutional

right," the Sixth Amendment guarantee of a speedy trial.Brief for Petitioner 26. Accordingly, he maintains, the alleged IAD violation should be treated as a constitutional vio-lation or as a "fundamental defect" satisfying the Hill standard, not as a mere technical error. Reed's argument isinsubstantial for, as he concedes, his constitutional right to a
speedy trial was in no way violated. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7.

10 Article V(c) provides in relevant part:
"[I]n the event that an action on the indictment, information, or complaint
on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged is not brought to trial
within the period provided in article III or article IV hereof, the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where the indictment, information, or complaint has been pending shall enter an order dismissing the same with
prejudice, and any detainer based thereon shall cease to be of any force
or effect."

Opinion of the Court
Reed's trial commenced 54 days after the 120-day periodexpired. He does not suggest that his ability to present a

defense was prejudiced by the delay. Nor could he plausiblymake such a claim.

11 Indeed, asserting a need for more time

to prepare for a trial that would be "fair and meaningful,"App. 128, Reed himself

requested a delay beyond the scheduled September 19 opening. A showing of prejudice is required to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment
Speedy Trial Clause, and that necessary ingredient is entirely missing here. See Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514, 530
(1972) (four factors figure in the determination of Sixth
Amendment speedy trial claims; one of the four is "prejudice
to the defendant").

IV

More strenuously, Reed argues that Hill and similar decisions establish a standard for federal prisoners seeking relief
under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255,12 not for state prisoners seeking relief under $ 2254. But it is scarcely doubted that, at least
where mere statutory violations are at issue, "$ 2255 was
intended to mirror $ 2254 in operative effect." Davis v.
United States, 417 U. S. 333, 344 (1974). Far from suggesting that the Hill standard is inapplicable to $ 2254 cases, our
decisions assume that Hill controls collateral review--under
both $$ 2254 and 2255--when a federal statute, but not the

11 As the Court of Appeals noted:
"Had Indiana put Reed to trial within 120 days of his transfer from federal
prison, everything would have proceeded as it did. Reed does not contend that vital evidence fell into the prosecutor's hands (or slipped through
his own fingers) between August 26 and September 19, 1983." 984 F. 2d,
at 212.

12 Section 2255 provides in pertinent part:

"A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of
Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United
States, . . . may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set
aside or correct the sentence."

Opinion of the Court
Constitution, is the basis for the postconviction attack. For
example, in Stone v. Powell, a $ 2254 case, we recalled "the
established rule with respect to nonconstitutional claims" as
follows: "[N]onconstitutional claims . . . can be raised on collateral review only if the alleged error constituted a ` "fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice." ' " 428 U. S., at 477, n. 10, quoting Davis,
417 U. S., at 346, quoting Hill, 368 U. S., at 428.13

Reed nevertheless suggests that we invoked the fundamental defect standard in Hill and Timmreck for this sole
reason: "So far as convictions obtained in the federal courts
are concerned, the general rule is that the writ of habeas
corpus will not be allowed to do service for an appeal."
Sunal v. Large, 332 U. S. 174, 178 (1947) (emphasis added).
The same "general rule," however, applies to $ 2254. Where
the petitioner--whether a state or federal prisoner--failed
properly to raise his claim on direct review, the writ is available only if the petitioner establishes "cause" for the waiver
and shows "actual prejudice resulting from the alleged . . .
violation." Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 84 (1977); id.,
at 87.

We see no reason to afford habeas review to a state prisoner like Reed, who let a time clock run without alerting the
trial court, yet deny collateral review to a federal prisoner
similarly situated. See Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S. 536,
542 (1976) (" `Plainly the interest in finality is the same with
regard to both federal and state prisoners. . . . There is no

13 See also United States v. Addonizio, 442 U. S. 178 (1979), in which we
reiterated that the Hill standard governs habeas review of all claims of
federal statutory error, citing Stone:

"[U]nless the claim alleges a lack of jurisdiction or constitutional error,
the scope of collateral attack has remained far more limited. Stone v.
Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 477, n. 10. The Court has held that an error of
law does not provide a basis for collateral attack unless the claimed error
constituted `a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete
miscarriage of justice.' " 442 U. S., at 185, quoting Hill, 368 U. S., at 428.

U. S. 152, 167-168 (1982) (collateral review of procedurallydefaulted claims is subject to same "cause and actual prejudice" standard, whether the claim is brought by a state pris-oner under $ 2254 or a federal prisoner under $ 2255).

Reed contends that the scope of review should be broaderunder $ 2254 than under $ 2255, because state prisoners, unlike their federal counterparts, have "had no meaningful op-portunity to have a federal court consider any federal claim."
Brief for Petitioner 34. But concern that state courts mightbe hostile to the federal law here at stake is muted by two
considerations. First, we have reserved the questionwhether federal habeas review is available to check violations of the IAD's speedy trial prescriptions when the statecourt disregards timely pleas for their application. See
supra, at 349. Second, the IAD is both federal law and thelaw of Indiana. Ind. Code $ 35-33-10-4 (1993). As the
Court of Appeals noted: "We have no more reason to supposethat the Supreme Court of Indiana seeks to undermine the
IAD than we have to suppose that it seeks to undermine anyother law of Indiana." 984 F. 2d, at 211.

I disagree with what seems to me (in Part II) too parsimoni-ous an application of that standard.

I
This Court has long applied equitable limitations to nar-row the broad sweep of federal habeas jurisdiction. See

Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 715-721 (1993) (Scalia,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). One class ofthose limitations consists of substantive restrictions upon

the type of claim that will be entertained. Hill, for exam-ple, holds that the claim of a federal statutory violation will
not be reviewed unless it alleges "a fundamental defectwhich inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice
[o]r an omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demandsof fair procedure." 368 U. S., at 428. Most statutory violations, at least when they do not occur "in the context of otheraggravating circumstances," are simply not important
enough to invoke the extraordinary habeas jurisdiction. Id.,at 429. See also

United States v. Timmreck, 441 U. S. 780,783-785 (1979).

Although Justice Ginsburg concludes that anunobjected-to violation of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (IAD), 18 U. S. C. App. $ 2, is not " `a fundamentaldefect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of
justice [or] an omission inconsistent with the rudimentarydemands of fair procedure,' " she declines to decide whether
that judgment would be altered "if a state court, presentedwith a timely request to set a trial date within the IAD's
120-day period, nonetheless refused to comply with ArticleIV(c)," ante, at 348, 349. To avoid the latter question, she
conducts an analysis of how petitioner waived his IADrights. See ante, at 350-351. The issue thus avoided is not
a constitutional one, and the avoiding of it (when the answeris so obvious) may invite a misunderstanding of the Hill test.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
The class of procedural rights that are not guaranteed bythe Constitution (which includes the Due Process Clauses),

but that nonetheless are inherently necessary to avoid "acomplete miscarriage of justice," or numbered among "the
rudimentary demands of fair procedure," is no doubt a small
one, if it is indeed not a null set. The guarantee of trialwithin 120 days of interjurisdictional transfer unless good

cause is shown--a provision with no application to prisonersinvolved with only a single jurisdiction or incarcerated in one
of the two States that do not participate in the voluntaryIAD compact--simply cannot be among that select class of
statutory rights.As for

Hill and Timmreck's reservation of the question
whether habeas would be available "in the context of other
aggravating circumstances," that seems to me clearly a ref-erence to circumstances

that cause additional prejudice to
the defendant, thereby elevating the error to a fundamental
defect or a denial of rudimentary procedural requirements--
not a reference to circumstances that make the trial judge's
behavior more willful or egregious. I thus think it wrong
to suggest that if only petitioner had not waived his IAD
speedy trial rights by failing to assert them in a timely fashion, "aggravating circumstances" might exist. See ante, at
349, 350-351. That says, in effect, that "aggravating circumstances" which can entitle a mere statutory violation to
habeas review may consist of the mere fact that the statutory violation was not waived. Surely that sucks the life out
of Hill.* Nor do I accept Justice Ginsburg's suggestion
that an interest in uniform interpretation of the IAD might

*Many courts, including the Indiana Supreme Court in evaluating this
petitioner's claim, see Reed v. State, 491 N. E. 2d 182, 185 (Ind. 1986), have
held that a prisoner's waiver of the 120-day limit will prevent violation of
the IAD, or will preclude the remedy of dismissal with prejudice. See,
e. g., United States v. Odom, 674 F. 2d 228 (CA4 1982). Perhaps, therefore, Justice Ginsburg's effort to decide the jurisdictional issue on as
narrow a ground as possible has caused her to decide the merits.

counsel in favor of habeas review in a nonwaiver situation.See ante, at 348-349. I see no reason why this Court's direct review of state and federal decisions will not suffice forthat purpose, as it does in most other contexts. Cf. Cuyler
v. Adams, 449 U. S. 433, 442 (1981). More importantly, how-ever, federal habeas jurisdiction was not created with the
intent, nor should we seek to give it the effect, of altering thefundamental disposition that

this Court, and not individualfederal district judges, has appellate jurisdiction, as to federal questions, over the supreme courts of the States.If there was ever a technical rule, the IAD's 120-day limit
is one. I think we produce confusion by declining to statethe obvious: that violation of that technicality, intentional or
unintentional, neither produces nor is analogous to (1) lackof jurisdiction of the convicting court, (2) constitutional violation, or (3) miscarriage of justice or denial of rudimentaryprocedures. It is no basis for federal habeas relief.

II
In addition to substantive limitations on the equitable ex-ercise of habeas jurisdiction, the Court has imposed procedural restrictions. For example, a habeas claim cognizableunder $ 2255 (the correlative of $ 2254 for federal prisoners),
such as a constitutional claim, will not be heard if it wasprocedurally defaulted below, absent a showing of cause and
actual prejudice. See United States v. Frady, 456 U. S. 152,167-168 (1982). And claims will ordinarily not be entertained under $ 2255 that have already been rejected on directreview. See Kaufman v. United States, 394 U. S. 217, 227,
n. 8 (1969); see also Withrow, 507 U. S., at 720-721 (Scalia,J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (collecting cases
showing that lower courts have uniformly followed the Kaufman dictum). Together, these two rules mean that "a prioropportunity for full and fair litigation is normally dispositive

of a federal prisoner's habeas claim." 507 U. S., at 721.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
Although this procedural limitation has not been raised asa defense in the present case, I note my view that, at least

where mere statutory violations are at issue, a prior oppor-tunity for full and fair litigation precludes a state-prisoner
petition no less than a federal-prisoner petition. As the
Court today reaffirms, " `$ 2255 was intended to mirror $ 2254
in operative effect.' " Ante, at 353, quoting Davis v. United
States, 417 U. S. 333, 344 (1974). Cf. Frady, supra, at 166.
Otherwise a prisoner, like petitioner, transferred from federal to state prison under the IAD would have three chances
to raise his claim (state direct, state habeas, and $ 2254) while
a prisoner transferred from state to federal prison under the
IAD would have only one. Since the present petitioner
raised his IAD claim on direct appeal in the Indiana courts
and on state habeas review, his federal habeas claim could
have been rejected on the ground that the writ ordinarily
will not be used to readjudicate fully litigated statutory
claims.

Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Souter join, dissenting.

The federal habeas corpus statute allows a state prisoner
to challenge his conviction on the ground that he is "in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of
the United States." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a). The Court acknowledges, as it must, that the Interstate Agreement on
Detainers (IAD) is a "la[w] . . . of the United States" under
this statute. See Carchman v. Nash, 473 U. S. 716, 719
(1985); Cuyler v. Adams, 449 U. S. 433, 438-442 (1981). In
addition, respondents concede that a defendant tried in clear
violation of the IAD's 120-day limit would be held in custody
in violation of a law of the United States. Tr. of Oral Arg.

collateral relief, at least where the defendant fails to invoke

his IAD rights according to the precise rules the Courtannounces for the first time today.

The Court purports to resolve this case by relying on
"precedent already in place," ante, at 348, referring to "principles and precedent generally controlling availability of the
great writ," ante, at 352. Our precedent, on its face, does
not reach nearly so far, and its extension to this case is
unwarranted under general habeas corpus principles. Most
seriously, the Court disregards Congress' unambiguous judgment about the severity of, and the necessary remedy for,
a violation of the IAD time limits. I respectfully dissent.

I
The Court purports to resolve this issue by relying on the
Hill-Timmreck line of cases. See Hill v. United States, 368
U. S. 424 (1962); Davis v. United States, 417 U. S. 333 (1974);
United States v. Timmreck, 441 U. S. 780 (1979); see also
Sunal v. Large, 332 U. S. 174 (1947); United States v. Frady,
456 U. S. 152 (1982). Despite the professed narrowness of
the Court's ultimate holding, however, its decision reflects
certain assumptions about the nature of habeas review of
state court judgments that do not withstand close analysis.
Each of the cases relied on by the majority--Hill, Timmreck, and Davis--concerned a federal prisoner's request
under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 for collateral relief from alleged defects in his federal trial. Before today, this Court never had
applied those precedents to bar review of a $ 2254 petition.1

It does so now without a full discussion of, or appreciation
for, the different policy concerns that should shape the exercise of federal courts' discretion in $ 2254 cases.

1 The majority notes, ante, at 354, that the Court cited Hill in Stone v.
Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 477, n. 10 (1976), a $ 2254 case. The decision in that
case, however, rested not on Hill, but on considerations unique to the
exclusionary rule.

A
While there are stray remarks in our opinions suggestingthat this Court has treated $$ 2254 and 2255 as equivalents,

2

there are other indications to the contrary, see, e. g., Withrowv.

Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 715 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurringin part and dissenting in part). In any event, there are

sound reasons to refrain from treating the two as identical.Primary among them is the importance under $ 2254 of providing a federal forum for review of state prisoners' federal
claims, not only in order to ensure the enforcement of federalrights, but also to promote uniformity in the state courts'

interpretation and application of federal law.3We recognized in

United States v. Frady, 456 U. S., at 166,
that the "federal prisoner . . . , unlike his state counterparts,has already had an opportunity to present his federal claims

in federal trial and appellate forums." For the federal pris2 The Court relies, for instance, on the remark in Davis that " `$ 2255
was intended to mirror $ 2254 in operative effect.' " Ante, at 353, quoting
Davis v. United States, 417 U. S. 333, 344 (1974). That statement, however, did no more than parry the suggestion that federal prisoners, unlike
state prisoners, were restricted to bringing claims "of constitutional dimension," and not those grounded in statutes. Ibid. The Davis Court
was addressing only the threshold statutory basis for relief--specifically
whether relief was available to federal prisoners for violations of "laws"
of the United States. It said nothing about the equitable considerations
that might guide the Court's exercise of its discretion to grant or deny
relief. In other words, Davis concerned jurisdictional, not prudential,
limits on habeas review. See Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 716
(1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (the "sweeping" breadth of habeas jurisdiction is "tempered by the restraints that
accompany the exercise of equitable discretion").

3 As a practical matter, this Court's direct review of state court decisions

cannot adequately ensure uniformity. See id., at 721, n. (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("Of course a federal forum is theoretically available in this Court, by writ of certiorari. Quite obviously,
however, this mode of review cannot be generally applied due to practical
limitations") (citation omitted).

Blackmun, J., dissenting
oner claiming statutory violations, habeas courts serve less
to guarantee uniformity of federal law or to satisfy a threshold need for a federal forum than to provide a backstop to
catch and correct certain nonconstitutional errors that
evaded the trial and appellate courts.4 Thus, this Court has
determined that "where the trial or appellate court has had
a `say' on a federal prisoner's claim, it may be open to the

$ 2255 court to determine that . . . `the prisoner is entitled to
no relief.' " Kaufman v. United States, 394 U. S. 217, 227,
n. 8 (1969) (citation omitted). Under Hill and Timmreck,
relief may be limited to the correction of "fundamental defect[s]" or "omission[s] inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure." Hill, 368 U. S., at 428. The Hill
principle, in short, is that where the error is not egregious,
the habeas court need not cover the ground already covered
by other federal courts.

For the state prisoner, by contrast, a primary purpose of

$ 2254 is to provide a federal forum to review a state prisoner's claimed violations of federal law, claims that were, of
necessity, addressed to the state courts. See Brown v.
Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 508 (1953) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.)
($ 2254 collateral review is necessary to permit a federal
court to have the "last say" with respect to questions of federal law); Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254 (1986) (requiring
exhaustion of federal claims in state courts). Thus, $ 2254
motions anticipate that the federal court will undertake an
independent review of the work of the state courts, even
where the federal claim was fully and fairly litigated.
Wright v. West, 505 U. S. 277 (1992) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (affirming that a state court's determina4 In fact, $ 2255 requires a prisoner to file his motion in the court that

tion of federal law and of mixed questions of federal law andfact are entitled to de novo review by federal habeas court).

Even if we recognize valid reasons for limiting this reviewto claims of serious or substantial error, where no federal

court previously has addressed the $ 2254 petitioner's federalclaims, there is less reason to sift these claims through so
fine a screen as Hill and Timmreck provide.Similarly, prudential justifications for

Hill's "fundamentalerror" standard may differ from state to federal proceedings.

In a federal trial and appeal, virtually any procedural error,however minor, will violate a "law" of the United States. In
this context, it is both impracticable and unnecessary toallow collateral review of all claims of error, particularly
since the defendant has had the opportunity both to raisethem in and to appeal them to a federal forum. It is hardly
surprising, therefore, that the Hill-Timmreck screening de-vice, which sorts the substantial errors from the mere technical violations, was developed in $ 2255. A state trial, by con-trast, implicates few federal laws outside the Constitution.
On the extraordinary occasions when Congress does considera federal law to be so important as to warrant its application
in state proceedings, this alone counsels an approach other

5 Justice Scalia proposes to foreclose $ 2254 review of federal nonconstitutional claims where the state prisoner was afforded a full and fair
opportunity to litigate those claims in state court. This proposal fails for
obvious reasons. To hold that full and fair litigation in state courts is a
substitute for a federal forum would be, to borrow a phrase, to "suc[k] the
life out of [$ 2254]." See ante, at 357 (concurring opinion). At the heart
of $ 2254 is federal court review of state court decisions on federal law.
With one notable exception, see Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 486-496
(1976), this Court uniformly has rejected a "full and fair opportunity to

than Hill-Timmreck to determine whether a violation of thatlaw warrants federal court review and enforcement.

6

The difference in the roles that federal statutes play instate and federal criminal proceedings points to another danger attendant to the uncritical application of the Hill standard in $ 2254. Hill has been read to disfavor habeas review
of federal statutory violations as a class. See, e. g., ante, at
356 (concurring opinion) (reading Hill for the proposition
that "[m]ost statutory violations . . . are simply not important
enough to invoke the extraordinary habeas jurisdiction").
This distinction between statutory and constitutional violations, exaggerated even in the context of $ 2255,7 has even
less justification under $ 2254.

6 There is an additional reason to question the application of the HillTimmreck "fundamental error" or "miscarriage of justice" standard to
Reed's $ 2254 claim. In both Hill and Timmreck, a federal prisoner bypassed an available federal appeal, and this Court endorsed the rule of
Sunal v. Large, 332 U. S. 174, 178 (1947), that collateral attack cannot "do
service for an appeal." See Hill, 368 U. S., at 428-429 (finding "apposite"
the reasoning in Sunal, 332 U. S., at 178, that " `[w]ise judicial administration of the federal courts' " counseled against permitting a collateral attack
to supplant appeals); Timmreck, 441 U. S., at 784 (seeing "no basis here
for allowing collateral attack `to do service for an appeal' ") (quoting
Sunal, 332 U. S., at 178); see also Hill, 368 U. S., at 428-429 (noting that
Congress " `provided a regular, orderly method for correction' " of errors
by " `granting an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals and by vesting us
with certiorari jurisdiction' " and that if defendants were permitted to
bypass this orderly method, " `[e]rror which was not deemed sufficiently
adequate to warrant an appeal would acquire new implications' ") (quoting
Sunal, 332 U. S., at 181-182). Thus, this standard appears to have been
based in part on principles of default. Our habeas jurisprudence subsequently has imposed a procedural default bar in $ 2254 cases, Wainwright
v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 84, 87 (1977), and that bar was not applied to Reed.

7 Hill and Timmreck can be read for the proposition that at least some

nonconstitutional violations "are simply not important enough" to warrant
habeas relief. In Hill, for example, a federal prisoner who did not appeal
his conviction was not permitted to obtain collateral relief based on the
sentencing court's "failure to comply with the formal requirements" of

Blackmun, J., dissenting
The language of $ 2254 itself permits a state prisoner to
seek relief for a violation "of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States." By its own terms, then, $ 2254
applies equally to claims of statutory or constitutional violations. When construing the similar language of Rev. Stat.

$ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, which permits civil actions against
state actors for "deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws" of the United
States, we concluded that "the phrase `and laws,' as used in

$ 1983, means what it says." Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U. S.

Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(a), which commands that every
defendant be allowed to make a statement before he is sentenced. 368
U. S., at 429. Similarly, in Timmreck, the Court held that a federal prisoner who did not appeal the validity of his guilty plea could not obtain
collateral relief under $ 2255 for technical violation of Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 11, which requires the court to ask a defendant represented by an attorney whether he wishes to say anything on his own
behalf. 441 U. S., at 784.

These cases could also be read narrowly as relying on the habeas petitioner's default on direct review, see n. 6, supra, or as encompassing only
violations of procedural rules. But even if read to establish a line between "important" and "merely technical" violations, this line is not identical to the line between statutory and constitutional violations. We made
this point clear in Davis v. United States, 417 U. S., at 345-346:

"[T]here is no support in the prior holdings of this Court for the proposition that a claim is not cognizable under $ 2255 merely because it is
grounded in the `laws of the United States' rather than the Constitution.
It is true, of course, that in Sunal v. Large, 332 U. S. 174 (1947), the Court
held that the nonconstitutional claim in that case could not be asserted to
set aside a conviction on collateral attack. But Sunal was merely an example of `the general rule . . . that the writ of habeas corpus will not be
allowed to do service for an appeal.' . . . Thus, Sunal cannot be read to
stand for the broad proposition that nonconstitutional claims can never
be asserted in collateral attacks upon criminal convictions. Rather, the
implication would seem to be that, absent the particular considerations
regarded as dispositive in that case, the fact that a contention is grounded
not in the Constitution, but in the `laws of the United States' would not
preclude its assertion in a $ 2255 proceeding."

525-526 (1939) ($ 1983 "include[s] rights, privileges and im-munities secured by the laws of the United States as well as
by the Constitution"). Section 1983 was enacted contempo-raneously with $ 2254, and it shares the common purpose of
making the federal courts available for the uniform interpre-tation and enforcement of federal rights in state settings.
There is no reason to read $ 1983 as placing statutes on a parwith the Constitution, but to read $ 2254 as largely indifferent to violations of statutes.Moreover, at least until today, this Court never had held
that a properly preserved claim of a violation of a federalstatute should be treated differently in a $ 2254 proceeding
from a claim of a violation of the Constitution. Nor is thereany reason to do so. Congress' decision to apply a federal
statute to state criminal proceedings, which ordinarily arethe exclusive province of state legislatures, generally should
be read to reflect the congressional determination that im-portant national interests are at stake. Where Congress
has made this determination, the federal courts should beopen to ensure the uniform enforcement and interpretation
of these interests.It should be clear, then, that the distinction drawn in

$ 2255 between fundamental errors and "omission[s] of thekind contemplated in

Hill, Timmreck, or Davis," ante, at349, simply does not support a distinction in $ 2254 between

constitutional and statutory violations.

II
Even putting aside any misgivings about the general ex-tension of Hill to $ 2254 proceedings, there is a specific, and

I believe insurmountable, obstacle to applying this standardto violations of the IAD. In concluding that an "unwitting
judicial slip of the kind involved here ranks with the noncon-stitutional lapses we have held not cognizable," ante, at 349,

in Hill and Timmreck, the majority overlooks Congress' own
determination about the seriousness of such a "slip" and its
consequences.

Congress spoke with unmistakable clarity when it prescribed both the time limits for trying a prisoner whose custody was obtained under the IAD and the remedy for a violation of those limits. Article IV(c) of the IAD provides that
the trial of a transferred prisoner "shall be commenced
within one hundred and twenty days" of his arrival in the
receiving jurisdiction.8 The IAD is equally clear about the
consequences of a failure to bring a defendant to trial within
the prescribed time limits. Article V(c) states:

"[I]n the event that an action on the indictment, information, or complaint on the basis of which the detainer
has been lodged is not brought to trial within the period
provided in article III or article IV hereof, the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where the indictment,
information, or complaint has been pending shall enter
an order dismissing the same with prejudice, and any
detainer based thereon shall cease to be of any force
or effect."

Quite simply, Congress has determined that a receiving
State must try the defendant within 120 days or not at all.
This determination undermines the majority's approach for
two reasons.

8 This command is subject to only two qualifications. First, Article
IV(c) itself provides that "for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner
or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter
may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance." Second, Article
VI(a) provides: "In determining the duration and expiration dates of the
time periods provided in articles III and IV of this agreement, the running
of said time periods shall be tolled whenever and for as long as the prisoner is unable to stand trial, as determined by the court having jurisdiction of the matter." The majority relies on neither qualification, nor did
the Indiana state courts.

368 REED v. FARLEY

Blackmun, J., dissenting
First, the congressional imposition of the drastic sanctionof dismissal forecloses any argument that a violation of the

IAD time limits is somehow a mere "technical" violation tootrivial to warrant habeas review. The dismissal with prejudice of criminal charges is a remedy rarely seen in criminallaw, even for constitutional violations. See,

e. g., Barker v.Wingo, 407 U. S. 514 (1972) (violation of Sixth Amendment

speedy trial right); Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U. S. 667 (1982)(violation of Double Jeopardy Clause). In fact, there are
countless constitutional violations for which habeas review isallowed, but dismissal is not required. However this Court
might have assessed the "fundamentality" of a violation ofthe IAD time limits in the absence of this sanction, this congressional directive does not leave us free to determine thatviolating the IAD time limits is no more serious than failure
to comply with the technical requirements of Federal Ruleof Criminal Procedure 11,

United States v. Timmreck, 441U. S. 780 (1979), or the formal requirements of Federal Rule

of Criminal Procedure 32(a), Hill, 368 U. S., at 428.Surely, a violation that Congress found troubling enough
to warrant the severe remedy of dismissal cannot becometrivial simply because the defendant did not utter what this
Court later determines to be the magic words at the magicmoment, particularly in the absence of any congressional requirement that the defendant either invoke his right to atimely trial or object to the setting of an untimely trial date.
In the absence of any suggestion that Reed procedurally de-faulted on his IAD claim so as to deprive him of relief on
direct review, it is curious, to say the least, to deny habeasrelief based largely on a sort of "quasi-default" standard.
Such a two-tiered "default" standard is unwarranted, and tomy knowledge, unprecedented.

9 Cf. Davis v. United States,

9 Sunal, Hill, and Timmreck, in which the defendant took no appeal
from a federal conviction, provide no support for this quasi-waiver standard. None of these cases presents a situation in which the defendant's

411 U. S. 233, 239, n. 6 (1973) (finding it "difficult to conceptualize the application of one waiver rule for purposes of federal appeal and another for purposes of federal habeas
corpus").

Second, Congress' clear mandate of the remedy of dismissal can be read to constrain this Court's equitable or
supervisory powers to determine an appropriate remedy,
either on direct review or on habeas.10 Nothing in our case
law even suggests that, where Congress has mandated a
remedy for the violation of a federal law, a habeas court is
free to cast about for a different remedy. The remedy prescribed by the statute must be the remedy that "law and
justice require." 28 U. S. C. $ 2243. In other words, the
prerogative writ of habeas corpus should be exercised in accord with an express legislative command. See IAD, Art.
IX, $ 5 (directing "[a]ll courts . . . of the United States . . . to
enforce the agreement on detainers and to cooperate . . . with
all party States in enforcing the agreement and effectuating
its purpose"). At the very least, the drastic remedy of
dismissal saves the IAD from falling below the Hill fundamentality line.

conduct was sufficient to present and preserve an issue for appeal, but was
found somehow wanting for habeas purposes.

10 McCarthy v. United States, 394 U. S. 459, 464, 468-472 (1969), and

Timmreck, 441 U. S., at 784, are not to the contrary. In McCarthy, the
Court looked to the language and purposes of Federal Rule of Criminal
Procedure 11 and to the lower courts' varying responses to noncompliance
before requiring, as an exercise of the Court's supervisory powers, relief
for Rule 11 violations raised on direct review. In Timmreck, the Court
denied relief on collateral review for a comparable Rule 11 violation, in
part because, under McCarthy, the defendant could have challenged it on
direct appeal, but did not. In these cases, of course, the remedy for a
violation was left to the Court. In requiring relief on direct review, but
not on habeas, the Court was at most differing with itself. It was not
disregarding a congressional directive.

370 REED v. FARLEY

Blackmun, J., dissenting
In sum, under a faithful reading of the IAD, the state trialcourt was required to dismiss with prejudice all charges

against Reed because his trial did not commence within 120days of his transfer to Indiana state custody. Faced with
the state courts' failure to impose this remedy, the federalhabeas court should have done so.

III
A final word is in order about the Court's emphasis onReed's conduct and its suggestion that relief might be in

order if only Reed had objected at the "relevant" moments.Under one reading of the majority opinion, the Court
concludes that Reed's failure to make oral objections at thepretrial hearings somehow mitigates the seriousness of the
failure to bring him to trial within the IAD time limits.In other words, the majority suggests that it is the
"unobjected-to" nature of the violation, ante, at 356 (concur-ring opinion), that reduces it to the level of a Hill-Timmreck
error, one with which the habeas court should not concernitself. But as already explained, the statute itself does not
permit this Court to denigrate the significance of theviolation.

It is also possible, however, to read the majority opinionas relying on a theory of waiver or procedural default. This
theory is equally untenable, particularly when due consider-ation is given not only to the language of the IAD, but also
to Reed's repeated attempts to invoke its protections. TheIAD itself does not require dismissal for a violation of its
120-day limit only "upon motion of the defendant," much less"upon defendant's timely oral objection to the setting of the
trial date." Instead, the statute unambiguously directscourts to dismiss charges when the time limits are breached.
This arguably puts the responsibility on courts and States topolice the applicable time limits. This is a reasonable choice
for Congress to make. Judges and prosecutors are playerswho can be expected to know the IAD's straightforward re512us2$80F 12-24-97 11:11:50 PAGES OPINPGT

quirements and to make a simple time calculation at the out-set of the proceedings against a transferred defendant.

Indeed, in this case, the trial court and prosecutor bothhad constructive notice of the IAD time limits. The Fulton
County Circuit Court signed and certified that the request
for temporary custody was transmitted "for action in accord-ance with its terms

and the provisions of the Agreement on
Detainers." App. 5-6 (emphasis added). The State's re-quest stated: "I propose to bring this person to trial on this

[information] within the time period specified in Article IV(c)of the [IAD]."

Id., at 5.
Even assuming, however, that a defendant must invoke the
IAD's time limits in order to obtain its protections, Reed
clearly did so here. In United States v. Mauro, 436 U. S.
340 (1978), this Court agreed that the defendant's "failure to
invoke the [IAD] in specific terms in his speedy trial motions
before the District Court did not result in a waiver" of his
claim that the Government violated the IAD. Id., at 364
(emphasis added). We concluded, instead, that the prosecution and the court were "on notice of the substance" of an
inmate's IAD claims when he "persistently requested that
he be given a speedy trial" and "sought the dismissal of his
indictment on the ground that the delay in bringing him to
trial while the detainer remained lodged against him was
causing him to be denied certain privileges at the state
prison." Id., at 364, 365. Reed did no less.

On May 9, 1983, at his first appearance before the court,
Reed, appearing without counsel, informed the court that he
would be in a halfway house but for the detainer. App. 12.
The court acknowledged that there is a "world of difference"
between a halfway house and the Fulton County jail. Id.,
at 14. The court later observed that Reed's incarceration
rendered him incapable of preparing his defense. Id., at 54.

At the June 27 pretrial conference, Reed asked the court
if it would prefer future motions orally or in writing. The
court responded, "I want it in writing," and "I read better

than I listen." Id., at 39-40; see also id., at 123 (noting pref-erence for written motions). Conforming to this request,

Reed filed a motion on July 25, requesting that "trial be heldwithin the legal guidelines of the Agreement on Detainer
Act." Id., at 56. Clarifying his concerns, Reed complainedthat the State of Indiana was "forcing [him] to be tried beyond the limits as set forth in the Agreement on DetainerAct," and specifically "request[ed that] no extension of time
be granted beyond those guidelines." Ibid. This pro semotion was filed 31 days before the 120-day period expired.

Three days later, Reed filed a motion stating that there
was "limited time left for trial within the laws." Id., at 88.
This pro se motion was filed 28 days before the IAD clockran out. Finally, on August 11, he filed a motion for subpoenas that sought prompt relief because the "Detainer Act timelimits" were "approaching."

Id., at 91. This pro se motion
was filed 15 days before the 120-day IAD time limit expired.Thus, after being instructed that the court wanted all motions in writing, Reed filed three timely written motions in-dicating his desire to be tried within the IAD time limits.
The Supreme Court of Indiana concluded that Reed's July 26
motion constituted "a general demand that trial be heldwithin the time limits of the IAD." 491 N. E. 2d 182, 185

(1993). Under Mauro, this was enough to put the court onnotice of his demands. Even as an original matter, when a
trial court instructs a pro se defendant to put his motions inwriting, and the defendant does so, not once, but three times,
it is wholly unwarranted then to penalize him for failing toobject orally at what this Court later singles out as the
magic moment.11

11 The Court, referring to the "clarity" of Reed's August 29 motion seeking discharge of the indictment, suggests that he deliberately obscured his
request until after the clock had run. Ante, at 344, 349. The Court fails
to mention, however, that Reed prepared his earlier motions both without
counsel and without adequate access to legal materials. It was only at
the August 1 pretrial conference that the court ordered the sheriff to pro512us2$80F 12-24-97 11:11:50 PAGES OPINPGT

This should be a simple matter. Reed invoked, and thetrial court denied, his right to be tried within the IAD's 120-

day time limit. Section 2254 authorizes federal courts togrant for such a violation whatever relief law and justice
require. The IAD requires dismissal of the indictment.Nothing in the IAD, in $ 2254, or in our precedent requires
or even suggests that federal courts should refrain from en-tertaining a state prisoner's claims of a violation of the IAD.
Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

was given two lawbooks, including one on Indiana criminal procedure, and
thereafter his draftsmanship improved.

DOLAN v. CITY OF TIGARD
certiorari to the supreme court of oregon
No. 93-518. Argued March 23, 1994--Decided June 24, 1994
The City Planning Commission of respondent city conditioned approval of

petitioner Dolan's application to expand her store and pave her parking
lot upon her compliance with dedication of land (1) for a public greenway
along Fanno Creek to minimize flooding that would be exacerbated by
the increases in impervious surfaces associated with her development
and (2) for a pedestrian/ bicycle pathway intended to relieve traffic congestion in the city's Central Business District. She appealed the commission's denial of her request for variances from these standards to the
Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA), alleging that the land dedication
requirements were not related to the proposed development and therefore constituted an uncompensated taking of her property under the
Fifth Amendment. LUBA found a reasonable relationship between (1)
the development and the requirement to dedicate land for a greenway,
since the larger building and paved lot would increase the impervious
surfaces and thus the runoff into the creek, and (2) alleviating the impact of increased traffic from the development and facilitating the provision of a pathway as an alternative means of transportation. Both the
Oregon Court of Appeals and the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed.

Held: The city's dedication requirements constitute an uncompensated

taking of property. Pp. 383-396.

(a) Under the well-settled doctrine of "unconstitutional conditions,"
the government may not require a person to give up a constitutional
right in exchange for a discretionary benefit conferred by the government where the property sought has little or no relationship to the benefit. In evaluating Dolan's claim, it must be determined whether an "essential nexus" exists between a legitimate state interest and the permit
condition. Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U. S. 825, 837.
If one does, then it must be decided whether the degree of the exactions demanded by the permit conditions bears the required relationship
to the projected impact of the proposed development. Id., at 834.
Pp. 383-386.

(b) Preventing flooding along Fanno Creek and reducing traffic congestion in the district are legitimate public purposes; and a nexus exists
between the first purpose and limiting development within the creek's

floodplain and between the second purpose and providing for alternative
means of transportation. Pp. 386-388.

(c) In deciding the second question--whether the city's findings are
constitutionally sufficient to justify the conditions imposed on Dolan's
permit--the necessary connection required by the Fifth Amendment is
"rough proportionality." No precise mathematical calculation is required, but the city must make some sort of individualized determination that the required dedication is related both in nature and extent
to the proposed development's impact. This is essentially the "reasonable relationship" test adopted by the majority of the state courts.
Pp. 388-391.

(d) The findings upon which the city relies do not show the required
reasonable relationship between the floodplain easement and Dolan's
proposed building. The Community Development Code already required that Dolan leave 15% of her property as open space, and the
undeveloped floodplain would have nearly satisfied that requirement.
However, the city has never said why a public, as opposed to a private,
greenway is required in the interest of flood control. The difference to
Dolan is the loss of her ability to exclude others from her property, yet
the city has not attempted to make any individualized determination to
support this part of its request. The city has also not met its burden
of demonstrating that the additional number of vehicle and bicycle trips
generated by Dolan's development reasonably relates to the city's requirement for a dedication of the pathway easement. The city must
quantify its finding beyond a conclusory statement that the dedication
could offset some of the traffic demand generated by the development.

The State of Oregon enacted a comprehensive land usemanagement program in 1973. Ore. Rev. Stat. $$ 197.005-
197.860 (1991). The program required all Oregon citiesand counties to adopt new comprehensive land use plans
that were consistent with the statewide planning goals.

$$ 197.175(1), 197.250. The plans are implemented by landuse regulations which are part of an integrated hierarchy

of legally binding goals, plans, and regulations. $$ 197.175,197.175(2)(b). Pursuant to the State's requirements, the city
of Tigard, a community of some 30,000 residents on thesouthwest edge of Portland, developed a comprehensive plan
and codified it in its Community Development Code (CDC).The CDC requires property owners in the area zoned Central Business District to comply with a 15% open space and
landscaping requirement, which limits total site coverage, in-cluding all structures and paved parking, to 85% of the parcel. CDC, ch. 18.66, App. to Pet. for Cert. G-16 to G-17.After the completion of a transportation study that identified

congestion in the Central Business District as a particularproblem, the city adopted a plan for a pedestrian/ bicycle

pathway intended to encourage alternatives to automobiletransportation for short trips. The CDC requires that new
development facilitate this plan by dedicating land for pedes-trian pathways where provided for in the pedestrian/ bicycle
pathway plan.1The city also adopted a Master Drainage Plan (Drainage
Plan). The Drainage Plan noted that flooding occurred inseveral areas along Fanno Creek, including areas near petitioner's property. Record, Doc. No. F, ch. 2, pp. 2-5 to 2-8;4-2 to 4-6; Figure 4-1. The Drainage Plan also established
that the increase in impervious surfaces associated with con-tinued urbanization would exacerbate these flooding problems. To combat these risks, the Drainage Plan suggested aseries of improvements to the Fanno Creek Basin, including
channel excavation in the area next to petitioner's property.App. to Pet. for Cert. G-13, G-38. Other recommendations
included ensuring that the floodplain remains free of struc-tures and that it be preserved as greenways to minimize
flood damage to structures. Record, Doc. No. F, ch. 5,pp. 5-16 to 5-21. The Drainage Plan concluded that the cost
of these improvements should be shared based on both directand indirect benefits, with property owners along the waterways paying more due to the direct benefit that they wouldreceive.

Opinion of the Court
and CDC $ 18.164.100 and the Tigard Park Plan carry outthese recommendations.

Petitioner Florence Dolan owns a plumbing and electricsupply store located on Main Street in the Central Business
District of the city. The store covers approximately 9,700square feet on the eastern side of a 1.67-acre parcel, which
includes a gravel parking lot. Fanno Creek flows throughthe southwestern corner of the lot and along its western
boundary. The year-round flow of the creek renders thearea within the creek's 100-year floodplain virtually unusable
for commercial development. The city's comprehensive planincludes the Fanno Creek floodplain as part of the city's
greenway system.Petitioner applied to the city for a permit to redevelop the
site. Her proposed plans called for nearly doubling the sizeof the store to 17,600 square feet and paving a 39-space parking lot. The existing store, located on the opposite side ofthe parcel, would be razed in sections as construction progressed on the new building. In the second phase of theproject, petitioner proposed to build an additional structure
on the northeast side of the site for complementary busi-nesses and to provide more parking. The proposed expansion and intensified use are consistent with the city's zoningscheme in the Central Business District. CDC $ 18.66.030,
App. to Brief for Petitioner C-1 to C-3.The City Planning Commission (Commission) granted petitioner's permit application subject to conditions imposed bythe city's CDC. The CDC establishes the following standard for site development review approval:

"Where landfill and/or development is allowed within
and adjacent to the 100-year floodplain, the City shallrequire the dedication of sufficient open land area for

greenway adjoining and within the floodplain. Thisarea shall include portions at a suitable elevation for the
construction of a pedestrian/ bicycle pathway within the

floodplain in accordance with the adopted pedestrian/bicycle plan." CDC $ 18.120.180.A.8, App. to Brief for

Respondent B-45 to B-46.
Thus, the Commission required that petitioner dedicate the
portion of her property lying within the 100-year floodplainfor improvement of a storm drainage system along Fanno

Creek and that she dedicate an additional 15-foot strip ofland adjacent to the floodplain as a pedestrian/ bicycle pathway.2 The dedication required by that condition encom-passes approximately 7,000 square feet, or roughly 10% of
the property. In accordance with city practice, petitionercould rely on the dedicated property to meet the 15% open
space and landscaping requirement mandated by the city's
zoning scheme. App. to Pet. for Cert. G-28 to G-29. Thecity would bear the cost of maintaining a landscaped buffer

between the dedicated area and the new store. Id., at G-44to G-45.

Petitioner requested variances from the CDC standards.
Variances are granted only where it can be shown that,
owing to special circumstances related to a specific piece of
the land, the literal interpretation of the applicable zoning
provisions would cause "an undue or unnecessary hardship"
unless the variance is granted. CDC $ 18.134.010, App. to

applicant shall dedicate to the City as Greenway all portions of the site
that fall within the existing 100-year floodplain [of Fanno Creek] (i. e., all
portions of the property below elevation 150.0) and all property 15 feet
above (to the east of) the 150.0 foot floodplain boundary. The building
shall be designed so as not to intrude into the greenway area." App. to
Pet. for Cert. G-43.

tive mitigating measures to offset the expected impacts ofher proposed development, as allowed under the CDC, petitioner simply argued that her proposed development wouldnot conflict with the policies of the comprehensive plan. Id.,
at E-4. The Commission denied the request.The Commission made a series of findings concerning the
relationship between the dedicated conditions and the pro-jected impacts of petitioner's project. First, the Commission noted that "[i]t is reasonable to assume that customersand employees of the future uses of this site could utilize a
pedestrian/ bicycle pathway adjacent to this development for
their transportation and recreational needs." City of Tigard Planning Commission Final Order No. 91-09 PC, App.to Pet. for Cert. G-24. The Commission noted that the site

plan has provided for bicycle parking in a rack in front of theproposed building and "[i]t is reasonable to expect that some
of the users of the bicycle parking provided for by the siteplan will use the pathway adjacent to Fanno Creek if it is
constructed." Ibid. In addition, the Commission foundthat creation of a convenient, safe pedestrian/ bicycle pathway system as an alternative means of transportation "could
plan, to any other applicable policies and standards, and to other properties in the same zoning district or vicinity;

"(2) There are special circumstances that exist which are peculiar to the
lot size or shape, topography or other circumstances over which the applicant has no control, and which are not applicable to other properties in
the same zoning district;

"(3) The use proposed will be the same as permitted under this title and
City standards will be maintained to the greatest extent possible, while
permitting some economic use of the land;

"(4) Existing physical and natural systems, such as but not limited to traffic, drainage, dramatic land forms, or parks will not be adversely affected
any more than would occur if the development were located as specified
in the title; and

"(5) The hardship is not self-imposed and the variance requested is the
minimum variance which would alleviate the hardship." App. to Brief for

offset some of the traffic demand on [nearby] streets andlessen the increase in traffic congestion."

Ibid.
The Commission went on to note that the required flood-plain dedication would be reasonably related to petitioner's

request to intensify the use of the site given the increase
in the impervious surface. The Commission stated that the"anticipated increased storm water flow from the subject

property to an already strained creek and drainage basin canonly add to the public need to manage the stream channel
and floodplain for drainage purposes." Id., at G-37. Basedon this anticipated increased storm water flow, the Commission concluded that "the requirement of dedication of the
floodplain area on the site is related to the applicant's plan to
intensify development on the site." Ibid. The Tigard City
Council approved the Commission's final order, subject to
one minor modification; the city council reassigned the responsibility for surveying and marking the floodplain area
from petitioner to the city's engineering department. Id.,
at G-7.

Petitioner appealed to the Land Use Board of Appeals
(LUBA) on the ground that the city's dedication requirements were not related to the proposed development, and,
therefore, those requirements constituted an uncompensated
taking of her property under the Fifth Amendment. In
evaluating the federal taking claim, LUBA assumed that the
city's findings about the impacts of the proposed development were supported by substantial evidence. Dolan v. Tigard, LUBA 91-161 (Jan. 7, 1992), reprinted at App. to Pet.
for Cert. D-15, n. 9. Given the undisputed fact that the proposed larger building and paved parking area would increase
the amount of impervious surfaces and the runoff into Fanno
Creek, LUBA concluded that "there is a `reasonable relationship' between the proposed development and the requirement to dedicate land along Fanno Creek for a greenway."
Id., at D-16. With respect to the pedestrian/ bicycle pathway, LUBA noted the Commission's finding that a signifi512us2$81H 01-08-98 12:34:37 PAGES OPINPGT

cantly larger retail sales building and parking lot would at-tract larger numbers of customers and employees and their

vehicles. It again found a "reasonable relationship" be-tween alleviating the impacts of increased traffic from the
development and facilitating the provision of a pedestrian/bicycle pathway as an alternative means of transportation.
Ibid.The Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's contention that in Nollan v. California Coastal
Comm'n, 483 U. S. 825 (1987), we had abandoned the "reason-able relationship" test in favor of a stricter "essential nexus"

test. 113 Ore. App. 162, 832 P. 2d 853 (1992). The OregonSupreme Court affirmed. 317 Ore. 110, 854 P. 2d 437 (1993).
The court also disagreed with petitioner's contention thatthe

Nollan Court abandoned the "reasonably related" test.317 Ore., at 118, 854 P. 2d, at 442. Instead, the court read

Nollan to mean that an "exaction is reasonably related to animpact if the exaction serves the same purpose that a denial
of the permit would serve." 317 Ore., at 120, 854 P. 2d, at443. The court decided that both the pedestrian/ bicycle
pathway condition and the storm drainage dedication had anessential nexus to the development of the proposed site.

Id.,at 121, 854 P. 2d, at 443. Therefore, the court found the

conditions to be reasonably related to the impact of theexpansion of petitioner's business. Ibid.

cago, 166 U. S. 226, 239 (1897), provides: "[N]or shall privateproperty be taken for public use, without just compensation." 5 One of the principal purposes of the Takings Clauseis "to bar Government from forcing some people alone to
bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, shouldbe borne by the public as a whole."

Armstrong v. UnitedStates, 364 U. S. 40, 49 (1960). Without question, had the

city simply required petitioner to dedicate a strip of landalong Fanno Creek for public use, rather than conditioning
the grant of her permit to redevelop her property on such adedication, a taking would have occurred. Nollan, supra,
at 831. Such public access would deprive petitioner of theright to exclude others, "one of the most essential sticks in
the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized asproperty."

Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U. S. 164,176 (1979).

On the other side of the ledger, the authority of state andlocal governments to engage in land use planning has been
sustained against constitutional challenge as long ago as ourdecision in

Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S.365 (1926). "Government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished

5 Justice Stevens' dissent suggests that this case is actually grounded
in "substantive" due process, rather than in the view that the Takings
Clause of the Fifth Amendment was made applicable to the States by the
Fourteenth Amendment. But there is no doubt that later cases have held
that the Fourteenth Amendment does make the Takings Clause of the
Fifth Amendment applicable to the States, see Penn Central Transp. Co.
v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 122 (1978); Nollan v. California Coastal
Comm'n, 483 U. S. 825, 827 (1987). Nor is there any doubt that these
cases have relied upon Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226
(1897), to reach that result. See, e. g., Penn Central, supra, at 122 ("The
issu[e] presented . . . [is] whether the restrictions imposed by New York
City's law upon appellants' exploitation of the Terminal site effect a `taking' of appellants' property for a public use within the meaning of the

without paying for every such change in the general law."
Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 413 (1922).
A land use regulation does not effect a taking if it "substan-tially advance[s] legitimate state interests" and does not

"den[y] an owner economically viable use of his land."
Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255, 260 (1980).6The sort of land use regulations discussed in the cases just

cited, however, differ in two relevant particulars from thepresent case. First, they involved essentially legislative determinations classifying entire areas of the city, whereashere the city made an adjudicative decision to condition petitioner's application for a building permit on an individualparcel. Second, the conditions imposed were not simply a
limitation on the use petitioner might make of her own par-cel, but a requirement that she deed portions of the property
to the city. In Nollan, supra, we held that governmental
authority to exact such a condition was circumscribed by the
Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Under the well-settled
doctrine of "unconstitutional conditions," the government
may not require a person to give up a constitutional right--
here the right to receive just compensation when property
is taken for a public use--in exchange for a discretionary
benefit conferred by the government where the benefit
sought has little or no relationship to the property. See
Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593 (1972); Pickering v.
Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,
391 U. S. 563, 568 (1968).

Petitioner contends that the city has forced her to choose
between the building permit and her right under the Fifth

6 There can be no argument that the permit conditions would deprive
petitioner of "economically beneficial us[e]" of her property as she currently operates a retail store on the lot. Petitioner assuredly is able to
derive some economic use from her property. See, e. g., Lucas v. South
Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1019 (1992); Kaiser Aetna v.
United States, 444 U. S. 164, 175 (1979); Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New

Amendment to just compensation for the public easements.Petitioner does not quarrel with the city's authority to exact

some forms of dedication as a condition for the grant of abuilding permit, but challenges the showing made by the city
to justify these exactions. She argues that the city hasidentified "no special benefits" conferred on her, and has not
identified any "special quantifiable burdens" created by hernew store that would justify the particular dedications required from her which are not required from the public atlarge.

III
In evaluating petitioner's claim, we must first determinewhether the "essential nexus" exists between the "legitimate

state interest" and the permit condition exacted by the city.
Nollan, 483 U. S., at 837. If we find that a nexus exists, wemust then decide the required degree of connection between

the exactions and the projected impact of the proposed de-velopment. We were not required to reach this question in
Nollan, because we concluded that the connection did notmeet even the loosest standard. Id., at 838. Here, however, we must decide this question.

A
We addressed the essential nexus question in Nollan.The California Coastal Commission demanded a lateral public easement across the Nollans' beachfront lot in exchangefor a permit to demolish an existing bungalow and replace it
with a three-bedroom house. Id., at 828. The public ease-ment was designed to connect two public beaches that were
separated by the Nollans' property. The Coastal Commis-sion had asserted that the public easement condition was imposed to promote the legitimate state interest of diminishingthe "blockage of the view of the ocean" caused by construction of the larger house.We agreed that the Coastal Commission's concern with
protecting visual access to the ocean constituted a legitimate

387Cite as: 512 U. S. 374 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
public interest. Id., at 835. We also agreed that the permitcondition would have been constitutional "even if it consisted

of the requirement that the Nollans provide a viewing spoton their property for passersby with whose sighting of the
ocean their new house would interfere." Id., at 836. We
resolved, however, that the Coastal Commission's regulatoryauthority was set completely adrift from its constitutional

moorings when it claimed that a nexus existed between vis-ual access to the ocean and a permit condition requiring lateral public access along the Nollans' beachfront lot. Id., at837. How enhancing the public's ability to "traverse to and
along the shorefront" served the same governmental purpose of "visual access to the ocean" from the roadway was
beyond our ability to countenance. The absence of a nexus
left the Coastal Commission in the position of simply trying
to obtain an easement through gimmickry, which converted
a valid regulation of land use into " `an out-and-out plan of
extortion.' " Ibid., quoting J. E. D. Associates, Inc. v. Atkinson, 121 N. H. 581, 584, 432 A. 2d 12, 14-15 (1981).

No such gimmicks are associated with the permit conditions imposed by the city in this case. Undoubtedly, the
prevention of flooding along Fanno Creek and the reduction
of traffic congestion in the Central Business District qualify
as the type of legitimate public purposes we have upheld.
Agins, 447 U. S., at 260-262. It seems equally obvious that
a nexus exists between preventing flooding along Fanno
Creek and limiting development within the creek's 100-year
floodplain. Petitioner proposes to double the size of her retail store and to pave her now-gravel parking lot, thereby
expanding the impervious surface on the property and increasing the amount of storm water runoff into Fanno Creek.

The same may be said for the city's attempt to reduce traffic congestion by providing for alternative means of transportation. In theory, a pedestrian/ bicycle pathway provides a
useful alternative means of transportation for workers and
shoppers: "Pedestrians and bicyclists occupying dedicated

105 Stat. 1914 (recognizing pedestrian and bicycle facilitiesas necessary components of any strategy to reduce traffic
congestion). B

The second part of our analysis requires us to determinewhether the degree of the exactions demanded by the city's
permit conditions bears the required relationship to the pro-jected impact of petitioner's proposed development.

Nollan, supra, at 834, quoting Penn Central Transp. Co. v. NewYork City, 438 U. S. 104, 127 (1978) (" `[A] use restriction may

constitute a "taking" if not reasonably necessary to the effec-tuation of a substantial government purpose' "). Here the
Oregon Supreme Court deferred to what it termed the "city'sunchallenged factual findings" supporting the dedication conditions and found them to be reasonably related to the im-pact of the expansion of petitioner's business. 317 Ore., at
120-121, 854 P. 2d, at 443.The city required that petitioner dedicate "to the City as
Greenway all portions of the site that fall within the existing100-year floodplain [of Fanno Creek] . . . and all property 15
feet above [the floodplain] boundary." Id., at 113, n. 3, 854P. 2d, at 439, n. 3. In addition, the city demanded that the
retail store be designed so as not to intrude into the green-way area. The city relies on the Commission's rather tentative findings that increased storm water flow from petition-er's property "can only add to the public need to manage the
[floodplain] for drainage purposes" to support its conclusionthat the "requirement of dedication of the floodplain area on

Opinion of the Court
the site is related to the applicant's plan to intensify develop-ment on the site." City of Tigard Planning Commission

Final Order No. 91-09 PC, App. to Pet. for Cert. G-37.The city made the following specific findings relevant to
the pedestrian/ bicycle pathway:

"In addition, the proposed expanded use of this site isanticipated to generate additional vehicular traffic

thereby increasing congestion on nearby collectorand arterial streets. Creation of a convenient, safe
pedestrian/ bicycle pathway system as an alternativemeans of transportation could offset some of the traffic
demand on these nearby streets and lessen the increasein traffic congestion." Id., at G-24.

The question for us is whether these findings are constitu-tionally sufficient to justify the conditions imposed by the
city on petitioner's building permit. Since state courts havebeen dealing with this question a good deal longer than we
have, we turn to representative decisions made by them.In some States, very generalized statements as to the necessary connection between the required dedication and theproposed development seem to suffice. See,

e. g., BillingsProperties, Inc. v. Yellowstone County, 144 Mont. 25, 394

P. 2d 182 (1964); Jenad, Inc. v. Scarsdale, 18 N. Y. 2d 78, 218N. E. 2d 673 (1966). We think this standard is too lax to
adequately protect petitioner's right to just compensation ifher property is taken for a public purpose.

Other state courts require a very exacting correspondence,described as the "specifi[c] and uniquely attributable" test.
The Supreme Court of Illinois first developed this test in
Pioneer Trust & Savings Bank v. Mount Prospect, 22 Ill. 2d375, 380, 176 N. E. 2d 799, 802 (1961).

7 Under this standard,

7 The "specifically and uniquely attributable" test has now been adopted
by a minority of other courts. See, e. g., J. E. D. Associates, Inc. v. Atkinson, 121 N. H. 581, 585, 432 A. 2d 12, 15 (1981); Divan Builders, Inc. v.

390 DOLAN v. CITY OF TIGARD

Opinion of the Court
if the local government cannot demonstrate that its exactionis directly proportional to the specifically created need, the

exaction becomes "a veiled exercise of the power of eminentdomain and a confiscation of private property behind the defense of police regulations." Id., at 381, 176 N. E. 2d, at 802.We do not think the Federal Constitution requires such exacting scrutiny, given the nature of the interests involved.A number of state courts have taken an intermediate position, requiring the municipality to show a "reasonable rela-tionship" between the required dedication and the impact of
the proposed development. Typical is the Supreme Courtof Nebraska's opinion in

Simpson v. North Platte, 206 Neb.240, 245, 292 N. W. 2d 297, 301 (1980), where that court

stated:

"The distinction, therefore, which must be made be-tween an appropriate exercise of the police power and

an improper exercise of eminent domain is whether therequirement has some reasonable relationship or nexus
to the use to which the property is being made or ismerely being used as an excuse for taking property simply because at that particular moment the landowner isasking the city for some license or permit."

Thus, the court held that a city may not require a propertyowner to dedicate private property for some future public
use as a condition of obtaining a building permit when suchfuture use is not "occasioned by the construction sought to
be permitted." Id., at 248, 292 N. W. 2d, at 302.Some form of the reasonable relationship test has been
adopted in many other jurisdictions. See, e. g., Jordan v.
Menomonee Falls, 28 Wis. 2d 608, 137 N. W. 2d 442 (1965);Collis v. Bloomington, 310 Minn. 5, 246 N. W. 2d 19 (1976)

F. 2d 646, 651-653 (CA9 1983).We think the "reasonable relationship" test adopted by a
majority of the state courts is closer to the federal constitu-tional norm than either of those previously discussed. But
we do not adopt it as such, partly because the term "rea-sonable relationship" seems confusingly similar to the term
"rational basis" which describes the minimal level of scru-tiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. We think a term such as "rough proportional-ity" best encapsulates what we hold to be the requirement
of the Fifth Amendment. No precise mathematical calcula-tion is required, but the city must make some sort of individualized determination that the required dedication is relatedboth in nature and extent to the impact of the proposed
development.8

8 Justice Stevens' dissent takes us to task for placing the burden on
the city to justify the required dedication. He is correct in arguing that
in evaluating most generally applicable zoning regulations, the burden
properly rests on the party challenging the regulation to prove that it
constitutes an arbitrary regulation of property rights. See, e. g., Village
of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365 (1926). Here, by contrast,
the city made an adjudicative decision to condition petitioner's application
for a building permit on an individual parcel. In this situation, the burden
properly rests on the city. See Nollan, 483 U. S., at 836. This conclusion
is not, as he suggests, undermined by our decision in Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494 (1977), in which we struck down a housing ordinance

Opinion of the Court
Justice Stevens' dissent relies upon a law review articlefor the proposition that the city's conditional demands for

part of petitioner's property are "a species of business regu-lation that heretofore warranted a strong presumption of
constitutional validity." Post, at 402. But simply denomi-nating a governmental measure as a "business regulation"
does not immunize it from constitutional challenge on theground that it violates a provision of the Bill of Rights. In
Marshall v. Barlow's, Inc., 436 U. S. 307 (1978), we held thata statute authorizing a warrantless search of business premises in order to detect OSHA violations violated the FourthAmendment. See also

Air Pollution Variance Bd. of Colo.v.
Western Alfalfa Corp., 416 U. S. 861 (1974); New York v.Burger, 482 U. S. 691 (1987). And in Central Hudson Gas &

Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557(1980), we held that an order of the New York Public Service
Commission, designed to cut down the use of electricitybecause of a fuel shortage, violated the First Amendment
insofar as it prohibited advertising by a utility company topromote the use of electricity. We see no reason why the
Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as much a part ofthe Bill of Rights as the First Amendment or Fourth Amendment, should be relegated to the status of a poor relation inthese comparable circumstances. We turn now to analysis of whether the findings relied upon by the city here,first with respect to the floodplain easement, and second
with respect to the pedestrian/ bicycle path, satisfied theserequirements.

It is axiomatic that increasing the amount of impervioussurface will increase the quantity and rate of storm water

p. 4-29. Therefore, keeping the floodplain open and freefrom development would likely confine the pressures on

Fanno Creek created by petitioner's development. In fact,because petitioner's property lies within the Central Business District, the CDC already required that petitioner leave
15% of it as open space and the undeveloped floodplain wouldhave nearly satisfied that requirement. App. to Pet. for

Cert. G-16 to G-17. But the city demanded more--it notonly wanted petitioner not to build in the floodplain, but it
also wanted petitioner's property along Fanno Creek for itsgreenway system. The city has never said why a public
greenway, as opposed to a private one, was required in the
interest of flood control.

The difference to petitioner, of course, is the loss of her
ability to exclude others. As we have noted, this right to
exclude others is "one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property."
Kaiser Aetna, 444 U. S., at 176. It is difficult to see why
recreational visitors trampling along petitioner's floodplain
easement are sufficiently related to the city's legitimate interest in reducing flooding problems along Fanno Creek, and
the city has not attempted to make any individualized determination to support this part of its request.

The city contends that the recreational easement along the
greenway is only ancillary to the city's chief purpose in controlling flood hazards. It further asserts that unlike the residential property at issue in Nollan, petitioner's property is
commercial in character and, therefore, her right to exclude
others is compromised. Brief for Respondent 41, quoting
United States v. Orito, 413 U. S. 139, 142 (1973) (" `The Constitution extends special safeguards to the privacy of the
home' "). The city maintains that "[t]here is nothing to suggest that preventing [petitioner] from prohibiting [the easements] will unreasonably impair the value of [her] property
as a [retail store]." PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins,

394 DOLAN v. CITY OF TIGARD

Opinion of the Court
Admittedly, petitioner wants to build a bigger store toattract members of the public to her property. She also

wants, however, to be able to control the time and mannerin which they enter. The recreational easement on the
greenway is different in character from the exercise of
state-protected rights of free expression and petition thatwe permitted in

PruneYard. In PruneYard, we held that a
major private shopping center that attracted more than25,000 daily patrons had to provide access to persons exercising their state constitutional rights to distribute pamphletsand ask passers-by to sign their petitions.

Id., at 85. We
based our decision, in part, on the fact that the shopping
center "may restrict expressive activity by adopting time,
place, and manner regulations that will minimize any interference with its commercial functions." Id., at 83. By
contrast, the city wants to impose a permanent recreational
easement upon petitioner's property that borders Fanno
Creek. Petitioner would lose all rights to regulate the time
in which the public entered onto the greenway, regardless of
any interference it might pose with her retail store. Her
right to exclude would not be regulated, it would be
eviscerated.

If petitioner's proposed development had somehow encroached on existing greenway space in the city, it would
have been reasonable to require petitioner to provide some
alternative greenway space for the public either on her property or elsewhere. See Nollan, 483 U. S., at 836 ("Although
such a requirement, constituting a permanent grant of continuous access to the property, would have to be considered
a taking if it were not attached to a development permit, the
Commission's assumed power to forbid construction of the
house in order to protect the public's view of the beach must
surely include the power to condition construction upon some
concession by the owner, even a concession of property
rights, that serves the same end"). But that is not the case
here. We conclude that the findings upon which the city re512us2$81H 01-08-98 12:34:37 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
lies do not show the required reasonable relationship be-tween the floodplain easement and the petitioner's proposed

new building.With respect to the pedestrian/ bicycle pathway, we have
no doubt that the city was correct in finding that the largerretail sales facility proposed by petitioner will increase traffic on the streets of the Central Business District. The cityestimates that the proposed development would generate
roughly 435 additional trips per day.9 Dedications forstreets, sidewalks, and other public ways are generally reasonable exactions to avoid excessive congestion from a pro-posed property use. But on the record before us, the city
has not met its burden of demonstrating that the additionalnumber of vehicle and bicycle trips generated by petitioner's
development reasonably relate to the city's requirement fora dedication of the pedestrian/ bicycle pathway easement.
The city simply found that the creation of the pathway "couldoffset some of the traffic demand . . . and lessen the increase
in traffic congestion." 10As Justice Peterson of the Supreme Court of Oregon explained in his dissenting opinion, however, "[t]he findings offact that the bicycle pathway system `could offset some of
the traffic demand' is a far cry from a finding that the bicyclepathway system will, or is likely to, offset some of the traffic
demand." 317 Ore., at 127, 854 P. 2d, at 447 (emphasis inoriginal). No precise mathematical calculation is required,
but the city must make some effort to quantify its findings in

square feet. Additional Trips Generated = 53.21 @ (17,600 !9,720).

10 In rejecting petitioner's request for a variance from the pathway dedication condition, the city stated that omitting the planned section of the
pathway across petitioner's property would conflict with its adopted policy
of providing a continuous pathway system. But the Takings Clause requires the city to implement its policy by condemnation unless the required relationship between petitioner's development and added traffic is
shown.

support of the dedication for the pedestrian/ bicycle pathwaybeyond the conclusory statement that it could offset some of

the traffic demand generated.

IV
Cities have long engaged in the commendable task of landuse planning, made necessary by increasing urbanization,

particularly in metropolitan areas such as Portland. Thecity's goals of reducing flooding hazards and traffic congestion, and providing for public greenways, are laudable, butthere are outer limits to how this may be done. "A strong
public desire to improve the public condition [will not] war-rant achieving the desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying for the change." Pennsylvania Coal,260 U. S., at 416.

The judgment of the Supreme Court of Oregon is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Blackmun and
Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

The record does not tell us the dollar value of petitionerFlorence Dolan's interest in excluding the public from the

greenway adjacent to her hardware business. The moun-tain of briefs that the case has generated nevertheless makes
it obvious that the pecuniary value of her victory is far lessimportant than the rule of law that this case has been used
to establish. It is unquestionably an important case.Certain propositions are not in dispute. The enlargement
of the Tigard unit in Dolan's chain of hardware stores willhave an adverse impact on the city's legitimate and substantial interests in controlling drainage in Fanno Creek andminimizing traffic congestion in Tigard's business district.
That impact is sufficient to justify an outright denial of herapplication for approval of the expansion. The city has nev512us2$81I 01-08-98 12:34:37 PAGES OPINPGT

Stevens, J., dissenting
ertheless agreed to grant Dolan's application if she will com-ply with two conditions, each of which admittedly will mitigate the adverse effects of her proposed development. Thedisputed question is whether the city has violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution by refusingto allow Dolan's planned construction to proceed unless those
conditions are met.The Court is correct in concluding that the city may not
attach arbitrary conditions to a building permit or to a vari-ance even when it can rightfully deny the application outright. I also agree that state court decisions dealing withordinances that govern municipal development plans provide
useful guidance in a case of this kind. Yet the Court's de-scription of the doctrinal underpinnings of its decision, the
phrasing of its fledgling test of "rough proportionality," andthe application of that test to this case run contrary to the
traditional treatment of these cases and break considerableand unpropitious new ground.

I
Candidly acknowledging the lack of federal precedent forits exercise in rulemaking, the Court purports to find guidance in 12 "representative" state court decisions. To do sois certainly appropriate.

1 The state cases the Court consults, however, either fail to support or decidedly underminethe Court's conclusions in key respects.

First, although discussion of the state cases permeates theCourt's analysis of the appropriate test to apply in this case,
the test on which the Court settles is not naturally derivedfrom those courts' decisions. The Court recognizes as an
initial matter that the city's conditions satisfy the "essentialnexus" requirement announced in

Nollan v. CaliforniaCoastal Comm'n, 483 U. S. 825 (1987), because they serve

the legitimate interests in minimizing floods and traffic con1 Cf. Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 513-521 (1977) (Stevens,

gestions. Ante, at 387-388.2 The Court goes on, however,to erect a new constitutional hurdle in the path of these conditions. In addition to showing a rational nexus to a publicpurpose that would justify an outright denial of the permit,
the city must also demonstrate "rough proportionality" be-tween the harm caused by the new land use and the benefit
obtained by the condition. Ante, at 391. The Court alsodecides for the first time that the city has the burden of establishing the constitutionality of its conditions by makingan "individualized determination" that the condition in question satisfies the proportionality requirement. See ibid.Not one of the state cases cited by the Court announces
anything akin to a "rough proportionality" requirement.For the most part, moreover, those cases that invalidated
municipal ordinances did so on state law or unspecifiedgrounds roughly equivalent to Nollan's "essential nexus" requirement. See, e. g., Simpson v. North Platte, 206 Neb.240, 245-248, 292 N. W. 2d 297, 301-302 (1980) (ordinance
lacking "reasonable relationship" or "rational nexus" to prop-erty's use violated Nebraska Constitution);

14-15 (1981) (state constitutional grounds). One case pur2 In Nollan the Court recognized that a state agency may condition the
grant of a land use permit on the dedication of a property interest if the
dedication serves a legitimate police-power purpose that would justify a
refusal to issue the permit. For the first time, however, it held that such
a condition is unconstitutional if the condition "utterly fails" to further a
goal that would justify the refusal. 483 U. S., at 837. In the Nollan
Court's view, a condition would be constitutional even if it required the
Nollans to provide a viewing spot for passers-by whose view of the ocean
was obstructed by their new house. Id., at 836. "Although such a requirement, constituting a permanent grant of continuous access to the
property, would have to be considered a taking if it were not attached to
a development permit, the Commission's assumed power to forbid construction of the house in order to protect the public's view of the beach
must surely include the power to condition construction upon some concession by the owner, even a concession of property rights, that serves the
same end." Ibid.

porting to apply the strict "specifically and uniquely attribut-able" test established by

Pioneer Trust & Savings Bank v.
Mount Prospect, 22 Ill. 2d 375, 176 N. E. 2d 799 (1961), never-theless found that test was satisfied because the legislature

had decided that the subdivision at issue created the need
for a park or parks. Billings Properties, Inc. v. Yellowstone
County, 144 Mont. 25, 33-36, 394 P. 2d 182, 187-188 (1964).
In only one of the seven cases upholding a land use regula-tion did the losing property owner petition this Court for

certiorari. See Jordan v. Menomonee Falls, 28 Wis. 2d 608,137 N. W. 2d 442 (1965), appeal dism'd, 385 U. S. 4 (1966)
(want of substantial federal question). Although 4 of the 12
opinions mention the Federal Constitution--2 of those only
in passing--it is quite obvious that neither the courts nor
the litigants imagined they might be participating in the
development of a new rule of federal law. Thus, although
these state cases do lend support to the Court's reaffirmance
of Nollan's reasonable nexus requirement, the role the Court
accords them in the announcement of its newly minted
second phase of the constitutional inquiry is remarkably
inventive.

In addition, the Court ignores the state courts' willingness
to consider what the property owner gains from the exchange in question. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin, for
example, found it significant that the village's approval of a
proposed subdivision plat "enables the subdivider to profit
financially by selling the subdivision lots as home-building
sites and thus realizing a greater price than could have been
obtained if he had sold his property as unplatted lands."
Jordan v. Menomonee Falls, 28 Wis. 2d, at 619-620; 137
N. W. 2d, at 448. The required dedication as a condition of
that approval was permissible "[i]n return for this benefit."
Ibid. See also Collis v. Bloomington, 310 Minn. 5, 11-13,
246 N. W. 2d 19, 23-24 (1976) (citing Jordan); College Station
v. Turtle Rock Corp., 680 S. W. 2d 802, 806 (Tex. 1984) (dedication requirement only triggered when developer chooses

to develop land). In this case, moreover, Dolan's acceptanceof the permit, with its attached conditions, would provide

her with benefits that may well go beyond any advantageshe gets from expanding her business. As the United
States pointed out at oral argument, the improvement thatthe city's drainage plan contemplates would widen the channel and reinforce the slopes to increase the carrying capacityduring serious floods, "confer[ring] considerable benefits on
the property owners immediately adjacent to the creek."Tr. of Oral Arg. 41-42.

The state court decisions also are enlightening in the ex-tent to which they required that the

entire parcel be givencontrolling importance. All but one of the cases involve

challenges to provisions in municipal ordinances requiringdevelopers to dedicate either a percentage of the entire parcel (usually 7 or 10 percent of the platted subdivision) or anequivalent value in cash (usually a certain dollar amount
per lot) to help finance the construction of roads, utilities,schools, parks, and playgrounds. In assessing the legality
of the conditions, the courts gave no indication that thetransfer of an interest in realty was any more objectionable
than a cash payment. See, e. g., Jenad, Inc. v. Scarsdale, 18N. Y. 2d 78, 218 N. E. 2d 673 (1966); Jordan v. Menomonee
Falls, 28 Wis. 2d 608, 137 N. W. 2d 442 (1965); Collis v.Bloomington, 310 Minn. 5, 246 N. W. 2d 19 (1976). None of
the decisions identified the surrender of the fee owner's"power to exclude" as having any special significance. Instead, the courts uniformly examined the character of theentire economic transaction.

II
It is not merely state cases, but our own cases as well, thatrequire the analysis to focus on the impact of the city's action

on the entire parcel of private property. In Penn Central
Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104 (1978), we statedthat takings jurisprudence "does not divide a single parcel

Stevens, J., dissenting
into discrete segments and attempt to determine whetherrights in a particular segment have been entirely abrogated." Id., at 130-131. Instead, this Court focuses "bothon the character of the action and on the nature and extent
of the interference with rights in the parcel as a whole."
Ibid. Andrus v. Allard, 444 U. S. 51 (1979), reaffirmed thenondivisibility principle outlined in Penn Central, stating

that "[a]t least where an owner possesses a full `bundle' ofproperty rights, the destruction of one `strand' of the bundle
is not a taking, because the aggregate must be viewed in itsentirety." 444 U. S., at 65-66.

3 As recently as last Term,

we approved the principle again. See Concrete Pipe &Products of Cal., Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension

Trust for Southern Cal., 508 U. S. 602, 644 (1993) (explainingthat "a claimant's parcel of property [cannot] first be divided
into what was taken and what was left" to demonstrate acompensable taking). Although limitation of the right to exclude others undoubtedly constitutes a significant infringe-ment upon property ownership,

Kaiser Aetna v. UnitedStates, 444 U. S. 164, 179-180 (1979), restrictions on that

right do not alone constitute a taking, and do not do so inany event unless they "unreasonably impair the value or use"
of the property. PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447U. S. 74, 82-84 (1980).

The Court's narrow focus on one strand in the propertyowner's bundle of rights is particularly misguided in a case
involving the development of commercial property. As Pro-fessor Johnston has noted:

"The subdivider is a manufacturer, processer, andmarketer of a product; land is but one of his raw materials. In subdivision control disputes, the developer is
3 Similarly, in Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480
U. S. 470, 498-499 (1987), we concluded that "[t]he 27 million tons of coal

Q. 871, 923 (1967).4
The exactions associated with the development of a retailbusiness are likewise a species of business regulation that

heretofore warranted a strong presumption of constitu-tional validity.

In Johnston's view, "if the municipality can demonstratethat its assessment of financial burdens against subdividers
is rational, impartial, and conducive to fulfillment of author-ized planning objectives, its action need be invalidated only
in those extreme and presumably rare cases where the bur-den of compliance is sufficiently great to deter the owner
from proceeding with his planned development." Id., at 917.The city of Tigard has demonstrated that its plan is rational
and impartial and that the conditions at issue are "conducive
to fulfillment of authorized planning objectives." Dolan, onthe other hand, has offered no evidence that her burden of

compliance has any impact at all on the value or profitabilityof her planned development. Following the teaching of the
cases on which it purports to rely, the Court should not iso-late the burden associated with the loss of the power to ex4 Johnston's article also sets forth a fair summary of the state cases from
which the Court purports to derive its "rough proportionality" test. See

by the new subdivision--especially Jordan v. Menomonee Falls, 28 Wis.

clude from an evaluation of the benefit to be derived fromthe permit to enlarge the store and the parking lot.

The Court's assurances that its "rough proportionality"test leaves ample room for cities to pursue the "commendable
task of land use planning," ante, at 396--even twice avowingthat "[n]o precise mathematical calculation is required,"

ante,at 391, 395--are wanting given the result that test compels

here. Under the Court's approach, a city must not only"quantify its findings," ante, at 395, and make "individualized
determination[s]" with respect to the nature and the extentof the relationship between the conditions and the impact,
ante, at 391, 393, but also demonstrate "proportionality."The correct inquiry should instead concentrate on whether
the required nexus is present and venture beyond considera-tions of a condition's nature or germaneness only if the developer establishes that a concededly germane condition is sogrossly disproportionate to the proposed development's adverse effects that it manifests motives other than land useregulation on the part of the city.

5 The heightened requirement the Court imposes on cities is even more unjustifiedwhen all the tools needed to resolve the questions presented

by this case can be garnered from our existing case law.

III
Applying its new standard, the Court finds two defectsin the city's case. First, while the record would adequately

support a requirement that Dolan maintain the portion ofthe floodplain on her property as undeveloped open space, it
does not support the additional requirement that the flood-plain be dedicated to the city.

Ante, at 392-395. Second,

5 Dolan's attorney overstated the danger when he suggested at oral
argument that without some requirement for proportionality, "[t]he City
could have found that Mrs. Dolan's new store would have increased traffic
by one additional vehicle trip per day [and] could have required her to
dedicate 75, 95 percent of her land for a widening of Main Street." Tr. of
Oral Arg. 52-53.

Stevens, J., dissenting
while the city adequately established the traffic increase thatthe proposed development would generate, it failed to quantify the offsetting decrease in automobile traffic that the bikepath will produce.

Ante, at 395-396. Even under the
Court's new rule, both defects are, at most, nothing more
than harmless error.In her objections to the floodplain condition, Dolan made

no effort to demonstrate that the dedication of that portionof her property would be any more onerous than a simple
prohibition against any development on that portion of herproperty. Given the commercial character of both the existing and the proposed use of the property as a retail store, it
seems likely that potential customers "trampling along petitioner's floodplain," ante, at 393, are more valuable than
a useless parcel of vacant land. Moreover, the duty to pay
taxes and the responsibility for potential tort liability may
well make ownership of the fee interest in useless land a
liability rather than an asset. That may explain why Dolan
never conceded that she could be prevented from building
on the floodplain. The city attorney also pointed out that

absent a dedication, property owners would be required to
"build on their own land" and "with their own money" a storage facility for the water runoff. Tr. of Oral Arg. 30-31.
Dolan apparently "did have that option," but chose not to
seek it. Id., at 31. If Dolan might have been entitled to a
variance confining the city's condition in a manner this Court
would accept, her failure to seek that narrower form of relief
at any stage of the state administrative and judicial proceedings clearly should preclude that relief in this Court now.

The Court's rejection of the bike path condition amounts
to nothing more than a play on words. Everyone agrees
that the bike path "could" offset some of the increased traffic
flow that the larger store will generate, but the findings do
not unequivocally state that it will do so, or tell us just how
many cyclists will replace motorists. Predictions on such
matters are inherently nothing more than estimates. Cer512us2$81I 01-08-98 12:34:37 PAGES OPINPGT

tainly the assumption that there will be an offsetting benefithere is entirely reasonable and should suffice whether it

amounts to 100 percent, 35 percent, or only 5 percent ofthe increase in automobile traffic that would otherwise occur.
If the Court proposes to have the federal judiciary micro-manage state decisions of this kind, it is indeed extending
its welcome mat to a significant new class of litigants. Al-though there is no reason to believe that state courts have
failed to rise to the task, property owners have surely founda new friend today.

IV
The Court has made a serious error by abandoning thetraditional presumption of constitutionality and imposing a

novel burden of proof on a city implementing an admittedlyvalid comprehensive land use plan. Even more consequential than its incorrect disposition of this case, however, is theCourt's resurrection of a species of substantive due process
analysis that it firmly rejected decades ago.6The Court begins its constitutional analysis by citing Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226, 239 (1897), forthe proposition that the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment is "applicable to the States through the FourteenthAmendment."

Ante, at 383. That opinion, however, con-tains no mention of either the Takings Clause or the Fifth

Amendment; 7 it held that the protection afforded by the DueProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment extends to
matters of substance as well as procedure,8 and that the sub6 See, e. g., Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726 (1963).
7 An earlier case deemed it "well settled" that the Takings Clause "is a

limitation on the power of the Federal government, and not on the States."
Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co., 13 Wall. 166, 177 (1872).

8 The Court held that a State "may not, by any of its agencies, disregard

the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment. Its judicial authorities
may keep within the letter of the statute prescribing forms of procedure
in the courts and give the parties interested the fullest opportunity to be
heard, and yet it might be that its final action would be inconsistent with
that amendment. In determining what is due process of law regard must

stance of "the due process of law enjoined by the Fourteenth
Amendment requires compensation to be made or adequately
secured to the owner of private property taken for public
use under the authority of a State." 166 U. S., at 235, 236-
241. It applied the same kind of substantive due process
analysis more frequently identified with a better known case
that accorded similar substantive protection to a baker's
liberty interest in working 60 hours a week and 10 hours a
day. See Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905).9

Later cases have interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive protection against uncompensated deprivations of private property by the States as though it incorporated the text of the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause.
See, e. g., Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis,
480 U. S. 470, 481, n. 10 (1987). There was nothing problematic about that interpretation in cases enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment against state action that involved the
actual physical invasion of private property. See Loretto v.
Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419, 427-
433 (1982); Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U. S., at
178-180. Justice Holmes charted a significant new course,
however, when he opined that a state law making
it "commercially impracticable to mine certain coal" had
"very nearly the same effect for constitutional purposes as
appropriating or destroying it." Pennsylvania Coal Co. v.
Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 414 (1922). The so-called "regulatory

be had to substance, not to form." Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago,
166 U. S. 226, 234-235 (1897).

9 The Lochner Court refused to presume that there was a reasonable

connection between the regulation and the state interest in protecting the
public health. 198 U. S., at 60-61. A similar refusal to identify a sufficient nexus between an enlarged building with a newly paved parking lot
and the state interests in minimizing the risks of flooding and traffic congestion proves fatal to the city's permit conditions in this case under the
Court's novel approach.

takings" doctrine that the Holmes dictum 10 kindled has anobvious kinship with the line of substantive due process

cases that Lochner exemplified. Besides having similar an-cestry, both doctrines are potentially open-ended sources of
judicial power to invalidate state economic regulations thatMembers of this Court view as unwise or unfair.

This case inaugurates an even more recent judicial innova-tion than the regulatory takings doctrine: the application of
the "unconstitutional conditions" label to a mutually benefi-cial transaction between a property owner and a city. The
Court tells us that the city's refusal to grant Dolan a discre-tionary benefit infringes her right to receive just compensation for the property interests that she has refused to dedi-cate to the city "where the property sought has little or no
relationship to the benefit." 11 Although it is well settledthat a government cannot deny a benefit on a basis that
infringes constitutionally protected interests--"especially[one's] interest in freedom of speech," Perry v. Sindermann,
408 U. S. 593, 597 (1972)--the "unconstitutional conditions"doctrine provides an inadequate framework in which to analyze this case.12

10 See Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U. S., at
484 (explaining why this portion of the opinion was merely "advisory").

11 Ante, at 385. The Court's entire explanation reads: "Under the wellsettled doctrine of `unconstitutional conditions,' the government may not
require a person to give up a constitutional right--here the right to receive just compensation when property is taken for a public use--in exchange for a discretionary benefit conferred by the government where the
benefit sought has little or no relationship to the property."

12 Although it has a long history, see Home Ins. Co. v. Morse, 20 Wall.

445, 451 (1874), the "unconstitutional conditions" doctrine has for just as
long suffered from notoriously inconsistent application; it has never been
an overarching principle of constitutional law that operates with equal
force regardless of the nature of the rights and powers in question. See,
e. g., Sunstein, Why the Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine is an Anachronism, 70 B. U. L. Rev. 593, 620 (1990) (doctrine is "too crude and too
general to provide help in contested cases"); Sullivan, Unconstitutional

Dolan has no right to be compensated for a taking unlessthe city acquires the property interests that she has refused

to surrender. Since no taking has yet occurred, there hasnot been any infringement of her constitutional right to compensation. See Preseault v. ICC, 494 U. S. 1, 11-17 (1990)(finding takings claim premature because property owner
had not yet sought compensation under Tucker Act); Hodelv.

Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452U. S. 264, 294-295 (1981) (no taking where no one "identified

any property . . . that has allegedly been taken").Even if Dolan should accept the city's conditions in exchange for the benefit that she seeks, it would not necessarily
follow that she had been denied "just compensation" since itwould be appropriate to consider the receipt of that benefit

in any calculation of "just compensation." See Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S., at 415 (noting that an "average reciprocity of advantage" was deemed to justify manylaws);

Hodel v. Irving, 481 U. S. 704, 715 (1987) (such " `reciprocity of advantage' " weighed in favor of a statute's constiConditions, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 1415, 1416 (1989) (doctrine is "riven with
inconsistencies"); Hale, Unconstitutional Conditions and Constitutional
Rights, 35 Colum. L. Rev. 321, 322 (1935) ("The Supreme Court has sustained many such exertions of power even after announcing the broad
doctrine that would invalidate them"). As the majority's case citations
suggest, ante, at 385, modern decisions invoking the doctrine have most
frequently involved First Amendment liberties, see also, e. g., Connick v.
Myers, 461 U. S. 138, 143-144 (1983); Elrod v. Burns, 427 U. S. 347, 361-363
(1976) (plurality opinion); Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398, 404 (1963);
Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513, 518-519 (1958). But see Posadas de
Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of P. R., 478 U. S. 328, 345-346
(1986) ("[T]he greater power to completely ban casino gambling necessarily includes the lesser power to ban advertising of casino gambling"). The
necessary and traditional breadth of municipalities' power to regulate
property development, together with the absence here of fragile and easily
"chilled" constitutional rights such as that of free speech, make it quite
clear that the Court is really writing on a clean slate rather than merely
applying "well-settled" doctrine. Ante, at 385.

tutionality). Particularly in the absence of any evidence on
the point, we should not presume that the discretionary benefit the city has offered is less valuable than the property
interests that Dolan can retain or surrender at her option.
But even if that discretionary benefit were so trifling that it
could not be considered just compensation when it has "little
or no relationship" to the property, the Court fails to explain
why the same value would suffice when the required nexus
is present. In this respect, the Court's reliance on the "unconstitutional conditions" doctrine is assuredly novel, and
arguably incoherent. The city's conditions are by no means
immune from constitutional scrutiny. The level of scrutiny,
however, does not approximate the kind of review that would
apply if the city had insisted on a surrender of Dolan's First
Amendment rights in exchange for a building permit. One
can only hope that the Court's reliance today on First
Amendment cases, see ante, at 385 (citing Perry v. Sindermann, supra, and Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township
High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563, 568 (1968)),
and its candid disavowal of the term "rational basis" to describe its new standard of review, see ante, at 391, do not
signify a reassertion of the kind of superlegislative power
the Court exercised during the Lochner era.

The Court has decided to apply its heightened scrutiny to
a single strand--the power to exclude--in the bundle of
rights that enables a commercial enterprise to flourish in an
urban environment. That intangible interest is undoubtedly
worthy of constitutional protection--much like the grandmother's interest in deciding which of her relatives may
share her home in Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494
(1977). Both interests are protected from arbitrary state
action by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It is, however, a curious irony that Members of the
majority in this case would impose an almost insurmountable
burden of proof on the property owner in the Moore case

while saddling the city with a heightened burden in thiscase.

13

In its application of what is essentially the doctrine ofsubstantive due process, the Court confuses the past with

the present. On November 13, 1922, the village of Euclid,Ohio, adopted a zoning ordinance that effectively confiscated
75 percent of the value of property owned by the Ambler
Realty Company. Despite its recognition that such an ordi-nance "would have been rejected as arbitrary and oppressive" at an earlier date, the Court (over the dissent ofJustices Van Devanter, McReynolds, and Butler) upheld
the ordinance. Today's majority should heed the words of
Justice Sutherland:

"Such regulations are sustained, under the complex conditions of our day, for reasons analogous to those which
justify traffic regulations, which, before the advent of
automobiles and rapid transit street railways, would
have been condemned as fatally arbitrary and unreasonable. And in this there is no inconsistency, for while
the meaning of constitutional guaranties never varies,
the scope of their application must expand or contract

13 The author of today's opinion joined Justice Stewart's dissent in Moore
v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494 (1977). There the dissenters found it
sufficient, in response to my argument that the zoning ordinance was an
arbitrary regulation of property rights, that "if the ordinance is a rational
attempt to promote `the city's interest in preserving the character of its
neighborhoods,' Young v. American Mini Theatres, [Inc.,] 427 U. S. 50,
71 (opinion of Stevens, J.), it is . . . a permissible restriction on the use of
private property under Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365, and
Nectow v. Cambridge, 277 U. S. 183." Id., at 540, n. 10. The dissent went
on to state that my calling the city to task for failing to explain the need
for enacting the ordinance "place[d] the burden on the wrong party."
Ibid. (emphasis added). Recently, two other Members of today's majority
severely criticized the holding in Moore. See United States v. Carlton,
512 U. S. 26, 40-42 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); see also
id., at 39 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (calling the doctrine of substantive due process "an oxymoron").

to meet the new and different conditions which areconstantly coming within the field of their operation.

In a changing world, it is impossible that it should beotherwise." Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.,
272 U. S. 365, 387 (1926).
In our changing world one thing is certain: uncertaintywill characterize predictions about the impact of new urban

developments on the risks of floods, earthquakes, traffic con-gestion, or environmental harms. When there is doubt concerning the magnitude of those impacts, the public interestin averting them must outweigh the private interest of the
commercial entrepreneur. If the government can demon-strate that the conditions it has imposed in a land use permit
are rational, impartial and conducive to fulfilling the aims ofa valid land use plan, a strong presumption of validity should
attach to those conditions. The burden of demonstratingthat those conditions have unreasonably impaired the economic value of the proposed improvement belongs squarelyon the shoulders of the party challenging the state action's
constitutionality. That allocation of burdens has served uswell in the past. The Court has stumbled badly today by
reversing it.I respectfully dissent.

Justice Souter, dissenting.
This case, like Nollan v. California Coastal Comm'n, 483U. S. 825 (1987), invites the Court to examine the relationship between conditions imposed by development permits,requiring landowners to dedicate portions of their land for
use by the public, and governmental interests in mitigatingthe adverse effects of such development.

Nollan declaredthe need for a nexus between the nature of an exaction of an

interest in land (a beach easement) and the nature of govern-mental interests. The Court treats this case as raising a
further question, not about the nature, but about the degree,of connection required between such an exaction and the

512us2$81M 01-08-98 12:34:38 PAGES OPINPGT
412 DOLAN v. CITY OF TIGARD

Souter, J., dissenting
adverse effects of development. The Court's opinion announces a test to address this question, but as I read the
opinion, the Court does not apply that test to these facts,
which do not raise the question the Court addresses.

First, as to the floodplain and greenway, the Court acknowledges that an easement of this land for open space (and
presumably including the five feet required for needed creek
channel improvements) is reasonably related to flood control,
see ante, at 387, 392-393, but argues that the "permanent
recreational easement" for the public on the greenway is not
so related, see ante, at 393-395. If that is so, it is not because of any lack of proportionality between permit condition
and adverse effect, but because of a lack of any rational connection at all between exaction of a public recreational area
and the governmental interest in providing for the effect of
increased water runoff. That is merely an application of Nollan's nexus analysis. As the Court notes, "[i]f petitioner's
proposed development had somehow encroached on existing
greenway space in the city, it would have been reasonable to
require petitioner to provide some alternative greenway
space for the public." Ante, at 394. But that, of course,
was not the fact, and the city of Tigard never sought to justify the public access portion of the dedication as related to
flood control. It merely argued that whatever recreational
uses were made of the bicycle path and the 1-foot edge on
either side were incidental to the permit condition requiring
dedication of the 15-foot easement for an 8-foot-wide bicycle
path and for flood control, including open space requirements
and relocation of the bank of the river by some 5 feet. It
seems to me such incidental recreational use can stand or fall
with the bicycle path, which the city justified by reference to
traffic congestion. As to the relationship the Court examines, between the recreational easement and a purpose never
put forth as a justification by the city, the Court unsurprisingly finds a recreation area to be unrelated to flood control.

Souter, J., dissenting
Second, as to the bicycle path, the Court again acknowl-edges the "theor[etically]" reasonable relationship between

"the city's attempt to reduce traffic congestion by providing[a bicycle path] for alternative means of transportation,"
ante, at 387, and the "correct" finding of the city that "thelarger retail sales facility proposed by petitioner will increase traffic on the streets of the Central Business Dis-trict,"

ante, at 395. The Court only faults the city for sayingthat the bicycle path "could" rather than "would" offset the

increased traffic from the store, ante, at 396. That again, asfar as I can tell, is an application of Nollan, for the Court
holds that the stated connection ("could offset") betweentraffic congestion and bicycle paths is too tenuous; only if
the bicycle path "would" offset the increased traffic by someamount could the bicycle path be said to be related to the
city's legitimate interest in reducing traffic congestion.I cannot agree that the application of

Nollan is a sound onehere, since it appears that the Court has placed the burden of

producing evidence of relationship on the city, despite theusual rule in cases involving the police power that the government is presumed to have acted constitutionally.* Hav-ing thus assigned the burden, the Court concludes that the
city loses based on one word ("could" instead of "would"),and despite the fact that this record shows the connection
the Court looks for. Dolan has put forward no evidence that

*See, e. g., Goldblatt v. Hempstead, 369 U. S. 590, 594-596 (1962); United
States v. Sperry Corp., 493 U. S. 52, 60 (1989). The majority characterizes
this case as involving an "adjudicative decision" to impose permit conditions, ante, at 391, n. 8, but the permit conditions were imposed pursuant
to Tigard's Community Development Code. See, e. g., $ 18.84.040, App. to
Brief for Respondent B-26. The adjudication here was of Dolan's requested variance from the permit conditions otherwise required to be imposed by the Code. This case raises no question about discriminatory, or
"reverse spot," zoning, which "singles out a particular parcel for different,
less favorable treatment than the neighboring ones." Penn Central

Souter, J., dissenting
the burden of granting a dedication for the bicycle path isunrelated in kind to the anticipated increase in traffic congestion, nor, if there exists a requirement that the relationshipbe related in degree, has Dolan shown that the exaction fails
any such test. The city, by contrast, calculated the in-creased traffic flow that would result from Dolan's proposed
development to be 435 trips per day, and its ComprehensivePlan, applied here, relied on studies showing the link between alternative modes of transportation, including bicyclepaths, and reduced street traffic congestion. See,

e. g., App.to Brief for Respondent A-5, quoting City of Tigard's Comprehensive Plan (" `Bicycle and pedestrian pathway systemswill result in some reduction of automobile trips within the
community' "). Nollan, therefore, is satisfied, and on thatassumption the city's conditions should not be held to fail a
further rough proportionality test or any other that mightbe devised to give meaning to the constitutional limits. As
Members of this Court have said before, "the common zoningregulations requiring subdividers to . . . dedicate certain
areas to public streets, are in accord with our constitutionaltraditions because the proposed property use would otherwise be the cause of excessive congestion." Pennell v. SanJose, 485 U. S. 1, 20 (1988) (

Scalia, J., concurring in partand dissenting in part). The bicycle path permit condition

is fundamentally no different from these.In any event, on my reading, the Court's conclusions about
the city's vulnerability carry the Court no further than Nol-lan has gone already, and I do not view this case as a suitable
vehicle for taking the law beyond that point. The right casefor the enunciation of takings doctrine seems hard to spot.

HONDA MOTOR CO., LTD., et al. v. OBERG

certiorari to the supreme court of oregon

No. 93-644. Argued April 20, 1994--Decided June 24, 1994
After finding petitioner Honda Motor Co., Ltd., liable for injuries respondent Oberg received while driving a three-wheeled all-terrain vehicle manufactured and sold by Honda, an Oregon jury awarded Oberg
$5 million in punitive damages, over five times the amount of his
compensatory damages award. In affirming, both the State Court of
Appeals and the State Supreme Court rejected Honda's argument that
the punitive damages award violated due process because it was excessive and because Oregon courts have no power to correct excessive
verdicts under a 1910 amendment to the State Constitution, which prohibits judicial review of the amount of punitive damages awarded by a
jury "unless the court can affirmatively say there is no evidence to
support the verdict." The latter court relied heavily on the fact that
the State's product liability punitive damages statute and the jury instructions in this case provided at least as much guidance as those
upheld in Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1. The court
also declined to interpret Haslip to hold that due process requires the
amount of a punitive damages award to be subject to postverdict or
appellate review, and noted that Oregon courts are not powerless because they may vacate a judgment if there is no evidence supporting
the jury's decision, and because appellate review is available to test the
sufficiency of jury instructions.

Held: Oregon's denial of review of the size of punitive damages awards violates the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Pp. 420-435.

(a) The Constitution imposes a substantive limit on the size of punitive damages awards. Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1;
TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U. S. 443. The
opinions in these cases strongly emphasized the importance of the procedural component of the Due Process Clause, and suggest that the
analysis here should focus on Oregon's departure from traditional procedures. Pp. 420-421.

(b) Judicial review of the size of punitive damages awards was a safeguard against excessive awards under the common law, see, e. g., Blunt
v. Little, 3 F. Cas. 760, 761-762, and in modern practice in the federal
courts and every State, except Oregon, judges review the size of such
awards. See, e. g., Dagnello v. Long Island R. Co., 289 F. 2d 797, 799-
800, n. 1. Pp. 421-426.

416 HONDA MOTOR CO. v. OBERG

Syllabus
(c) There is a dramatic difference between judicial review under the
common law and the scope of review available in Oregon. At least since
the State Supreme Court definitively construed the 1910 amendment in
Van Lom v. Schneiderman, 187 Ore. 89, 210 P. 2d 461, Oregon law has
provided no procedure for reducing or setting aside a punitive damages
award where the only basis for relief is the amount awarded. No Oregon court for more than half a century has inferred passion or prejudice
from the size of a damages award, and no court in more than a decade
has even hinted that it might possess the power to do so. If courts
had such power, the State Supreme Court would have mentioned it in
responding to Honda's arguments in this very case. The review that is
provided ensures only that there is evidence to support some punitive
damages, not that the evidence supports the amount actually awarded,
thus leaving the possibility that a guilty defendant may be unjustly punished. Pp. 426-429.

(d) This Court has not hesitated to find proceedings violative of due
process where a party has been deprived of a well-established commonlaw protection against arbitrary and inaccurate adjudication. See, e. g.,
Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510. Punitive damages pose an acute danger
of arbitrary deprivation of property, since jury instructions typically
leave the jury with wide discretion in choosing amounts and since evidence of a defendant's net worth creates the potential that juries will
use their verdicts to express biases against big businesses. Oregon has
removed one of the few procedural safeguards which the common law
provided against that danger without providing any substitute procedure and without any indication that the danger has in any way subsided
over time. Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516, 538; International
Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310, distinguished. Pp. 430-432.

(e) The safeguards that Oberg claims Oregon has provided--the limitation of punitive damages to the amount specified in the complaint,
the clear and convincing standard of proof, preverdict determination of
maximum allowable punitive damages, and detailed jury instructions--
do not adequately safeguard against arbitrary awards. Nor does the
fact that a jury's arbitrary decision to acquit a defendant charged with
a crime is unreviewable offer a historic basis for such discretion in civil
cases. The Due Process Clause says nothing about arbitrary grants of
freedom, but its whole purpose is to prevent arbitrary deprivations of
liberty or property. Pp. 432-435.

418 HONDA MOTOR CO. v. OBERG

Opinion of the Court
Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
An amendment to the Oregon Constitution prohibits judi-cial review of the amount of punitive damages awarded by

a jury "unless the court can affirmatively say there is noevidence to support the verdict." The question presented
is whether that prohibition is consistent with the Due Proc-ess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We hold that it
is not. I

Petitioner Honda Motor Co., Ltd., manufactured and soldthe three-wheeled all-terrain vehicle that overturned while
respondent was driving it, causing him severe and perma-nent injuries. Respondent brought suit alleging that petitioner knew or should have known that the vehicle had aninherently and unreasonably dangerous design. The jury
found petitioner liable and awarded respondent $919,390.39in compensatory damages and punitive damages of $5 million. The compensatory damages, however, were reducedby 20% to $735,512.31, because respondent's own negligence
contributed to the accident. On appeal, relying on ourthen-recent decision in

Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip,499 U. S. 1 (1991), petitioner argued that the award of punitive damages violated the Due Process Clause of the Four-teenth Amendment, because the punitive damages were excessive and because Oregon courts lacked the power tocorrect excessive verdicts.

The Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed, as did the Oregon
Supreme Court. The latter court relied heavily on the factthat the Oregon statute governing the award of punitive

damages in product liability actions and the jury instruc-tions in this case

1 contain substantive criteria that provide

1 The jury instructions, in relevant part, read: " `Punitive damages may
be awarded to the plaintiff in addition to general damages to punish
wrongdoers and to discourage wanton misconduct. In order for plaintiff
to recover punitive damages against the defendant[s], the plaintiff must

Opinion of the Court
at least as much guidance to the factfinders as the Alabama
statute and jury instructions that we upheld in Haslip. The
Oregon Supreme Court also noted that Oregon law provides
an additional protection by requiring the plaintiff to prove
entitlement to punitive damages by clear and convincing evidence rather than a mere preponderance. Recognizing that
other state courts had interpreted Haslip as including a
"clear . . . constitutional mandate for meaningful judicial
scrutiny of punitive damage awards," Adams v. Murakami,
54 Cal. 3d 105, 118, 813 P. 2d 1348, 1356 (1991); see also
Alexander & Alexander, Inc. v. B. Dixon Evander & Assocs.,
Inc., 88 Md. App. 672, 596 A. 2d 687 (1991), the court nevertheless declined to "interpret Haslip to hold that an award
of punitive damages, to comport with the requirements of
the Due Process Clause, always must be subject to a form
of post-verdict or appellate review that includes the possibility of remittitur." 316 Ore. 263, 284, 851 P. 2d 1084, 1096
(1993). It also noted that trial and appellate courts were
"not entirely powerless" because a judgment may be vacated
if "there is no evidence to support the jury's decision," and
because "appellate review is available to test the sufficiency of the jury instructions." Id., at 285, 851 P. 2d, at
1096-1097.

prove by clear and convincing evidence that defendant[s have] shown wanton disregard for the health, safety, and welfare of others. . . . If you decide this issue against the defendant[s], you may award punitive damages, although you are not required to do so, because punitive damages
are discretionary. In the exercise of that discretion, you shall consider
evidence, if any, of the following: First, the likelihood at the time of the
sale [of the three-wheeled vehicle] that serious harm would arise from
defendants' misconduct. Number two, the degree of the defendants'
awareness of that likelihood. Number three, the duration of the misconduct. Number four, the attitude and conduct of the defendant[s] upon
notice of the alleged condition of the vehicle. Number five, the financial
condition of the defendant[s]. And the amount of punitive damages may
not exceed the sum of $5 million.' " 316 Ore. 263, 282, n. 11, 851 P. 2d

420 HONDA MOTOR CO. v. OBERG

Opinion of the Court
We granted certiorari, 510 U. S. 1068 (1994), to considerwhether Oregon's limited judicial review of the size of punitive damages awards is consistent with our decision inHaslip.

II
Our recent cases have recognized that the Constitutionimposes a substantive limit on the size of punitive damages

awards. Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1(1991);

TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp.,509 U. S. 443 (1993). Although they fail to "draw a mathematical bright line between the constitutionally acceptableand the constitutionally unacceptable,"

id., at 458; Haslip,499 U. S., at 18, a majority of the Justices agreed that the

Due Process Clause imposes a limit on punitive damagesawards. A plurality in TXO assented to the proposition that
"grossly excessive" punitive damages would violate dueprocess, 509 U. S., at 453-455, while

Justice O'Connor, whodissented because she favored more rigorous standards,

noted that "[i]t is thus common ground that an award maybe so excessive as to violate due process," id., at 480. In
the case before us today we are not directly concerned withthe character of the standard that will identify unconstitutionally excessive awards; rather, we are confronted with thequestion of what procedures are necessary to ensure that
punitive damages are not imposed in an arbitrary manner.More specifically, the question is whether the Due Process
Clause requires judicial review of the amount of punitivedamages awards.

The opinions in both Haslip and TXO strongly empha-sized the importance of the procedural component of the
Due Process Clause. In Haslip, the Court held that thecommon-law method of assessing punitive damages did not
violate procedural due process. In so holding, the Courtstressed the availability of both "meaningful and adequate
review by the trial court" and subsequent appellate review.499 U. S., at 20. Similarly, in TXO, the plurality opinion

421Cite as: 512 U. S. 415 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
found that the fact that the "award was reviewed and upheld by the trial judge" and unanimously affirmed on appeal gave rise "to a strong presumption of validity." 509
U. S., at 457. Concurring in the judgment, Justice Scalia
( joined by Justice Thomas) considered it sufficient that
traditional common-law procedures were followed. In particular, he noted that " `procedural due process' requires judicial review of punitive damages awards for reasonableness."
Id., at 471.

All of those opinions suggest that our analysis in this
case should focus on Oregon's departure from traditional procedures. We therefore first contrast the relevant commonlaw practice with Oregon's procedure, which that State's
Supreme Court once described as "a system of trial by jury
in which the judge is reduced to the status of a mere monitor." Van Lom v. Schneiderman, 187 Ore. 89, 113, 210 P. 2d
461, 471 (1949). We then examine the constitutional implications of Oregon's deviation from established common-law
procedures.

III

Judicial review of the size of punitive damages awards
has been a safeguard against excessive verdicts for as long
as punitive damages have been awarded. One of the earliest reported cases involving exemplary damages, Huckle
v. Money, 2 Wils. 205, 95 Eng. Rep. 768 (C. P. 1763), arose
out of King George III's attempt to punish the publishers
of the allegedly seditious North Briton, No. 45. The King's
agents arrested the plaintiff, a journeyman printer, in his
home and detained him for six hours. Although the defendants treated the plaintiff rather well, feeding him "beef
steakes and beer, so that he suffered very little or no damages," 2 Wils., at 205, 95 Eng. Rep., at 768, the jury awarded
him # 300, an enormous sum almost 300 times the plaintiff 's weekly wage. The defendant's lawyer requested a new
trial, arguing that the jury's award was excessive. Plain512us2$82I 12-24-97 12:15:24 PAGES OPINPGT
422 HONDA MOTOR CO. v. OBERG

Opinion of the Court
tiff 's counsel, on the other hand, argued that "in cases of
tort . . . the court will never interpose in setting aside verdicts for excessive damages." Id., at 206, 95 Eng. Rep.,
at 768. While the court denied the motion for new trial,
the Chief Justice explicitly rejected plaintiff 's absolute rule
against review of damages amounts. Instead, he noted that
when the damages are "outrageous" and "all mankind at first
blush must think so," a court may grant a new trial "for
excessive damages." Id., at 207, 95 Eng. Rep., at 769. In
accord with his view that the amount of an award was relevant to the motion for a new trial, the Chief Justice noted
that "[u]pon the whole I am of opinion the damages are not
excessive." Ibid.

Subsequent English cases, while generally deferring to
the jury's determination of damages, steadfastly upheld the
court's power to order new trials solely on the basis that
the damages were too high. Fabrigas v. Mostyn, 2 Black.
W. 929, 96 Eng. Rep. 549 (C. P. 1773) (Damages "may be so
monstrous and excessive, as to be in themselves an evidence of passion or partiality in the jury"); 2 Sharpe v. Brice,
2 Black. W. 942, 96 Eng. Rep. 557 (C. P. 1774) ("It has never
been laid down, that the Court will not grant a new trial for
excessive damages in any cases of tort"); Leith v. Pope, 2
Black. W. 1327, 1328, 96 Eng. Rep. 777, 778 (C. P. 1779) ("[I]n
cases of tort the Court will not interpose on account of the
largeness of damages, unless they are so flagrantly excessive
as to afford an internal evidence of the prejudice and partial2 As in many early cases, it is unclear whether this case specifically
concerns punitive damages or merely ordinary compensatory damages.
Since there is no suggestion that different standards of judicial review
were applied for punitive and compensatory damages before the 20th century, no effort has been made to separate out the two classes of cases.
See Brief for Legal Historians Daniel R. Coquillette et al. as Amici Curiae
2, 3, 6-7, 15 (discussing together "punitive damages, personal injury, and
other cases involving difficult-to-quantify damages").

144 (K. B. 1793) (new trial granted for excessive damages);
Goldsmith v. Lord Sefton, 3 Anst. 808, 145 Eng. Rep. 1046

128 Eng. Rep. 696, 698 (C. P. 1813) ("[I]t is now well acknowledged in all the Courts of Westminster-hall, that whether
in actions for criminal conversation, malicious prosecutions,
words, or any other matter, if the damages are clearly too
large, the Courts will send the inquiry to another jury").

Respondent calls to our attention the case of Beardmore
v. Carrington, 2 Wils. 244, 95 Eng. Rep. 790 (C. P. 1764),
in which the court asserted that "there is not one single
case, (that is law), in all the books to be found, where the
court has granted a new trial for excessive damages in actions for torts." Id., at 249, 95 Eng. Rep., at 793. Respondent would infer from that statement that 18th-century
common law did not provide for judicial review of damages.
Respondent's argument overlooks several crucial facts.
First, the Beardmore case antedates all but one of the cases
cited in the previous paragraph. Even if respondent's interpretation of the case were correct, it would be an interpretation the English courts rejected soon thereafter.
Second, Beardmore itself cites at least one case that it concedes granted a new trial for excessive damages, Chambers
v. Robinson, 2 Str. 691, 93 Eng. Rep. 787 (K. B. 1726), although it characterizes the case as wrongly decided. Third,
to say that "there is not one single case . . . in all the books"
is to say very little, because then, much more so than now,
only a small proportion of decided cases was reported. For
example, for 1764, the year Beardmore was decided, only 16
Common Pleas cases are recorded in the standard reporter.
2 Wils. 208-257, 95 Eng. Rep. 769-797. Finally, the inference respondent would draw, that 18th-century English common law did not permit a judge to order new trials for excessive damages, is explicitly rejected by Beardmore itself,

Opinion of the Court
which cautioned against that very inference: "We desired tobe understood that this court does not say, or lay down any

rule that there can never happen a case of such excessivedamages in tort where the court may not grant a new trial."
2 Wils., at 250, 95 Eng. Rep., at 793.Common-law courts in the United States followed their
English predecessors in providing judicial review of the sizeof damages awards. They too emphasized the deference
ordinarily afforded jury verdicts, but they recognized thatjuries sometimes awarded damages so high as to require
correction. Thus, in 1822, Justice Story, sitting as CircuitJustice, ordered a new trial unless the plaintiff agreed to
a reduction in his damages.3 In explaining his ruling, henoted:

"As to the question of excessive damages, I agree, thatthe court may grant a new trial for excessive damages. . . .
It is indeed an exercise of discretion full of delicacy anddifficulty. But if it should clearly appear that the jury
have committed a gross error, or have acted from im-proper motives, or have given damages excessive in
relation to the person or the injury, it is as much theduty of the court to interfere, to prevent the wrong,
as in any other case." Blunt v. Little, 3 F. Cas. 760,761-762 (No. 1,578) (CC Mass. 1822).

See also Whipple v. Cumberland Mfg. Co., 29 F. Cas. 934,937-938 (No. 17, 516) (CC Me. 1843).

3 While Justice Story's grant of a new trial was clearly in accord with
established common-law procedure, the remittitur--withdrawal of new
trial if the plaintiff agreed to a specific reduction of damages--may have
been an innovation. See Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S. 474, 482-485 (1935).
On the other hand, remittitur may have a better historical pedigree than
previously thought. See King v. Watson, 2 T. R. 199-200, 100 Eng. Rep.
108 (K. B. 1788) ("[O]n a motion in the Common Pleas to set aside the
verdict for excessive damages . . . the Court recommended a compromise, and on Hurry's agreeing to accept 1500 [pounds] they discharged
the rule").

Opinion of the Court
In the 19th century, both before and after the ratificationof the Fourteenth Amendment, many American courts reviewed damages for "partiality" or "passion and prejudice."Nevertheless, because of the difficulty of probing juror reasoning, passion and prejudice review was, in fact, review ofthe amount of awards. Judges would infer passion, prejudice, or partiality from the size of the award.4 Coffin v. Coffin, 4 Mass. 1, 41 (1808) (In cases of personal injury, "a verdictmay be set aside for excessive damages" when "from the

exorbitancy of them the court must conclude that the juryacted from passion, partiality, or corruption");

Taylor v.
Giger, 3 Ky. 586, 587 (1808) ("In actions of tort . . . a newtrial ought not to be granted for excessiveness of damages,

unless the damages found are so enormous as to shew that
the jury were under some improper influence, or were ledastray by the violence of prejudice or passion");

authority to award new trials on the basis of the size of dam-ages awards. 1 D. Graham, A Treatise on the Law of New
Trials 442 (2d ed. 1855) ("[E]ven in personal torts, wherethe jury find

may think proper to allow will be accepted by the court,unless so exorbitant as to indicate that they have been influenced by passion, prejudice or a perverted judgment").Modern practice is consistent with these earlier authorities. In the federal courts and in every State, except Ore-gon, judges review the size of damages awards. See Dagnello v. Long Island R.

IV
There is a dramatic difference between the judicial reviewof punitive damages awards under the common law and the

scope of review available in Oregon. An Oregon trial judge,or an Oregon appellate court, may order a new trial if the
jury was not properly instructed, if error occurred duringthe trial, or if there is no evidence to support any punitive
damages at all. But if the defendant's only basis for reliefis the amount of punitive damages the jury awarded, Oregon

Opinion of the Court
provides no procedure for reducing or setting aside thataward. This has been the law in Oregon at least since 1949

when the State Supreme Court announced its opinion in VanLom v. Schneiderman, 187 Ore. 89, 210 P. 2d 461 (1949),
definitively construing the 1910 amendment to the OregonConstitution.

5

In that case the court held that it had no power to reduceor set aside an award of both compensatory and punitive

damages that was admittedly excessive.6 It recognized thatthe constitutional amendment placing a limitation on its
power was a departure from the traditional common-law ap-proach.

7 That opinion's characterization of Oregon's "lonely

eminence" in this regard, id., at 113, 210 P. 2d, at 471, is stillan accurate portrayal of its unique position. Every other

State in the Union affords postverdict judicial review of the

5 The amended Article VII, $ 3, of the Oregon Constitution provides: "In
actions at law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars,
the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury
shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of this State, unless the court
can affirmatively say there is no evidence to support the verdict."

6 "The court is of the opinion that the verdict of $10,000.00 is excessive.

Some members of the court think that only the award of punitive damages
is excessive; others that both the awards of compensatory and punitive
damages are excessive. Since a majority are of the opinion that this court
has no power to disturb the verdict, it is not deemed necessary to discuss
the grounds for these divergent views." Van Lom v. Schneiderman, 187
Ore., at 93, 210 P. 2d, at 462 (1949).

7 "The guaranty of the right to jury trial in suits at common law, incorporated in the Bill of Rights as one of the first ten amendments of the Constitution of the United States, was interpreted by the Supreme Court of the
United States to refer to jury trial as it had been theretofore known in
England; and so it is that the federal judges, like the English judges, have
always exercised the prerogative of granting a new trial when the verdict
was clearly against the weight of the evidence, whether it be because
excessive damages were awarded or for any other reason. The state
courts were conceded similar powers. . . . [U]p to 1910, when the people
adopted Art. VII, $ 3, of our Constitution, there was no state in the union,
so far as we are advised, where this method of control of the jury did not
prevail." Id., at 112-113, 210 P. 2d, at 471.

amount of a punitive damages award, see supra, at 426, andsubsequent decisions have reaffirmed Oregon judges' lack of

authority to order new trials or other relief to remedy exces-sive damages. Fowler v. Courtemanche, 202 Ore. 413, 448,
274 P. 2d 258, 275 (1954) ("If this court were authorized toexercise its common law powers, we would unhesitatingly
hold that the award of $35,000 as punitive damages wasexcessive . . .");

Tenold v. Weyerhaeuser Co., 127 Ore. App.511, 873 P. 2d 413 (1994) (Oregon court cannot examine jury

award to ensure compliance with $500,000 statutory limit onnoneconomic damages).

Respondent argues that Oregon's procedures do not devi-ate from common-law practice, because Oregon judges have
the power to examine the size of the award to determinewhether the jury was influenced by passion and prejudice.
This is simply incorrect. The earliest Oregon cases inter-preting the 1910 amendment squarely held that Oregon
courts lack precisely that power. Timmins v. Hale, 122 Ore.24, 43-44, 256 P. 770, 776 (1927);

McCulley v. Homestead
Bakery, Inc., 141 Ore. 460, 465-466, 18 P. 2d 226, 228 (1933).Although dicta in later cases have suggested that the issue

might eventually be revisited, see Van Lom, 187 Ore., at 106,210 P. 2d, at 468, the earlier holdings remain Oregon law.
No Oregon court for more than half a century has inferredpassion and prejudice from the size of a damages award, and
no court in more than a decade has even hinted that courtsmight possess the power to do so.

8 Finally, if Oregon courts

8 The last reported decision to suggest that a new trial might be ordered
because the size of the award suggested passion and prejudice was Trenery v. Score, 45 Ore. App. 611, 615, 609 P. 2d 388, 389 (1980) (noting that
"[i]t is doubtful" that passion and prejudice review continues to be available); see also Foley v. Pittenger, 264 Ore. 310, 503 P. 2d 476 (1972). More
recent decisions suggest that the type of passion and prejudice review
envisioned by the common law and former Ore. Rev. Stat. $ 17.610 (repealed by 1979 Ore. Laws, ch. 284, $ 199) is no longer available. See Tenold v. Weyerhaeuser Co., 127 Ore. App. 511, 873 P. 2d 413 (1994).

Opinion of the Court
could evaluate the excessiveness of punitive damages awards
through passion and prejudice review, the Oregon Supreme
Court would have mentioned that power in this very case.
Petitioners argued that Oregon procedures were unconstitutional precisely because they failed to provide judicial review of the size of punitive damages awards. The Oregon
Supreme Court responded by rejecting the idea that judicial
review of the size of punitive damages awards was required
by Haslip. 316 Ore., at 263, 851 P. 2d, at 1084. As the
court noted, two state appellate courts, including the California Supreme Court, had reached the opposite conclusion.
Id., at 284, n. 13, 851 P. 2d, at 1096, n. 13. If, as respondent claims, Oregon law provides passion and prejudice review of excessive verdicts, the Oregon Supreme Court would
have had a more obvious response to petitioners' argument.

Respondent also argues that Oregon provides adequate review, because the trial judge can overturn a punitive damages award if there is no substantial evidence to support an
award of punitive damages. See Fowler v. Courtemanche,
202 Ore., at 448-449, 274 P. 2d, at 275. This argument is
unconvincing, because the review provided by Oregon courts
ensures only that there is evidence to support some punitive
damages, not that there is evidence to support the amount
actually awarded. While Oregon's judicial review ensures
that punitive damages are not awarded against defendants
entirely innocent of conduct warranting exemplary damages,
Oregon, unlike the common law, provides no assurance that
those whose conduct is sanctionable by punitive damages are
not subjected to punitive damages of arbitrary amounts.
What we are concerned with is the possibility that a culpable defendant may be unjustly punished; evidence of culpability warranting some punishment is not a substitute for
evidence providing at least a rational basis for the particular
deprivation of property imposed by the State to deter future wrongdoing.

430 HONDA MOTOR CO. v. OBERG

Opinion of the Court

V
Oregon's abrogation of a well-established common-law pro-tection against arbitrary deprivations of property raises a

presumption that its procedures violate the Due ProcessClause. As this Court has stated from its first due process
cases, traditional practice provides a touchstone for constitu-tional analysis.

Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Im-provement Co., 18 How. 272 (1856); Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S.

510 (1927); Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278 (1936); In re
Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 361 (1970); Burnham v. SuperiorCourt of Cal., County of Marin, 495 U. S. 604 (1990); Pacific

Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1 (1991). Because thebasic procedural protections of the common law have been
regarded as so fundamental, very few cases have arisen inwhich a party has complained of their denial. In fact, most
of our due process decisions involve arguments that tradi-tional procedures provide too little protection and that additional safeguards are necessary to ensure compliance withthe Constitution.

Ownbey v. Morgan, 256 U. S. 94 (1921);Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County of Marin, 495

U. S. 604 (1990); Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S.1 (1991).

Nevertheless, there are a handful of cases in which a partyhas been deprived of liberty or property without the safeguards of common-law procedure. Hurtado v. California,110 U. S. 516 (1884);

Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510 (1927);Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278 (1936); In re Oliver, 333

U. S. 257 (1948); In re Winship, 397 U. S., at 361. When theabsent procedures would have provided protection against
arbitrary and inaccurate adjudication, this Court has nothesitated to find the proceedings violative of due process.
Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510 (1927); Brown v. Mississippi,297 U. S. 278 (1936);

In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257 (1948); In reWinship, 397 U. S., at 361. Of course, not all deviations

from established procedures result in constitutional infir-mity. As the Court noted in Hurtado, to hold all procedural

Opinion of the Court
change unconstitutional "would be to deny every quality ofthe law but its age, and to render it incapable of progress or

improvement." 110 U. S., at 529. A review of the cases,however, suggests that the case before us is unlike those
in which abrogations of common-law procedures have been
upheld.In

Hurtado, for example, examination by a neutral magistrate provided criminal defendants with nearly the sameprotection as the abrogated common-law grand jury procedure. Id., at 538. Oregon, by contrast, has provided nosimilar substitute for the protection provided by judicial review of the amount awarded by the jury in punitive damages.Similarly, in

International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S.
310 (1945), this Court upheld the extension of state-court
jurisdiction over persons not physically present, in spiteof contrary well-established prior practice. That change,

however, was necessitated by the growth of a new business
entity, the corporation, whose ability to conduct business
without physical presence had created new problems not envisioned by rules developed in another era. See Burnham,
495 U. S., at 617. In addition, the dramatic improvements
in communication and transportation made litigation in a
distant forum less onerous. No similar social changes suggest the need for Oregon's abrogation of judicial review,
nor do improvements in technology render unchecked punitive damages any less onerous. If anything, the rise of
large, interstate and multinational corporations has aggravated the problem of arbitrary awards and potentially
biased juries.9

9 Respondent cites as support for his argument Chicago, R. I. & P. R.
Co. v. Cole, 251 U. S. 54, 55 (1919) (Holmes, J.). In that case, the Court
upheld a provision of the Oklahoma Constitution providing that " `the
defense of contributory negligence . . . shall . . . be left to the jury.' "
Chicago, R. I. provides little support for respondent's case. Justice
Holmes' reasoning relied on the fact that a State could completely abolish
the defense of contributory negligence. This case, however, is different,

432 HONDA MOTOR CO. v. OBERG

Opinion of the Court
Punitive damages pose an acute danger of arbitrary dep-rivation of property. Jury instructions typically leave the

jury with wide discretion in choosing amounts, and the pres-entation of evidence of a defendant's net worth creates the
potential that juries will use their verdicts to express biasesagainst big businesses, particularly those without strong
local presences. Judicial review of the amount awarded wasone of the few procedural safeguards which the common law
provided against that danger. Oregon has removed thatsafeguard without providing any substitute procedure and
without any indication that the danger of arbitrary awardshas in any way subsided over time. For these reasons, we
hold that Oregon's denial of judicial review of the size ofpunitive damages awards violates the Due Process Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment.10

VI
Respondent argues that Oregon has provided other safe-guards against arbitrary awards and that, in any event, the

exercise of this unreviewable power by the jury is consistentwith the jury's historic role in our judicial system.

Respondent points to four safeguards provided in the Ore-gon courts: the limitation of punitive damages to the amount
specified in the complaint, the clear and convincing standardof proof, preverdict determination of maximum allowable punitive damages, and detailed jury instructions. The first,
because the TXO and Haslip opinions establish that States cannot abolish
limits on the award of punitive damages.

10 This case does not pose the more difficult question of what standard

of review is constitutionally required. Although courts adopting a more
deferential approach use different verbal formulations, there may not be
much practical difference between review that focuses on "passion and
prejudice," "gross excessiveness," or whether the verdict was "against the
great weight of the evidence." All of these may be rough equivalents
of the standard this Court articulated in Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S.
307, 324 (1979) (whether "no rational trier of fact could have" reached the
same verdict).

433Cite as: 512 U. S. 415 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
limitation of punitive damages to the amount specified, ishardly a constraint at all, because there is no limit to the

amount the plaintiff can request, and it is unclear whetheran award exceeding the amount requested could be set aside.
See Tenold v. Weyerhaeuser Co., 127 Ore. App. 511, 873 P. 2d413 (1994) (Oregon Constitution bars court from examining
jury award to ensure compliance with $500,000 statutorylimit on noneconomic damages). The second safeguard, the
clear and convincing standard of proof, is an important checkagainst unwarranted imposition of punitive damages, but,
like the "no substantial evidence" review discussed supra,at 429, it provides no assurance that those whose conduct is
sanctionable by punitive damages are not subjected to puni-tive damages of arbitrary amounts. Regarding the third
purported constraint, respondent cites no cases to supportthe idea that Oregon courts do or can set maximum punitive
damages awards in advance of the verdict. Nor are weaware of any court which implements that procedure. Respondent's final safeguard, proper jury instruction, is a well-established and, of course, important check against excessive
awards. The problem that concerns us, however, is the pos-sibility that a jury will not follow those instructions and may
return a lawless, biased, or arbitrary verdict.11

11 Respondent also argues that empirical evidence supports the effectiveness of these safeguards. It points to the analysis of an amicus showing that the average punitive damages award in a products liability case
in Oregon is less than the national average. Brief for Trial Lawyers
for Public Justice as Amicus Curiae. While we welcome respondent's
introduction of empirical evidence on the effectiveness of Oregon's legal
rules, its statistics are undermined by the fact that the Oregon average
is computed from only two punitive damages awards. It is well known
that one cannot draw valid statistical inferences from such a small number
of observations.

Empirical evidence, in fact, supports the importance of judicial review
of the size of punitive damages awards. The most exhaustive study of
punitive damages establishes that over half of punitive damages awards
were appealed, and that more than half of those appealed resulted in reductions or reversals of the punitive damages. In over 10% of the cases

434 HONDA MOTOR CO. v. OBERG

Opinion of the Court
In support of his argument that there is a historic basisfor making the jury the final arbiter of the amount of punitive damages, respondent calls our attention to early civiland criminal cases in which the jury was allowed to judge
the law as well as the facts. See Johnson v. Louisiana, 406U. S. 356, 374, n. 11 (1972) (Powell, J., concurring). As we
have already explained, in civil cases, the jury's discretion todetermine the amount of damages was constrained by judicial review.12 The criminal cases do establish--as does ourpractice today--that a jury's arbitrary decision to acquit a
defendant charged with a crime is completely unreviewable.There is, however, a vast difference between arbitrary
grants of freedom and arbitrary deprivations of liberty orproperty. The Due Process Clause has nothing to say about
the former, but its whole purpose is to prevent the latter.A decision to punish a tortfeasor by means of an exaction of

appealed, the judge found the damages to be excessive. Rustad, In Defense of Punitive Damages in Products Liability: Testing Tort Anecdotes
with Empirical Data, 78 Iowa L. Rev. 1, 57 (1992). The above statistics
understate the importance of judicial review, because they consider only
appellate review, rather than review by the trial court, which may be even
more significant, and because they ignore the fact that plaintiffs often
settle for less than the amount awarded because they fear appellate reduction of damages. See ibid.

12 Judicial deference to jury verdicts may have been stronger in 18thcentury America than in England, and judges' power to order new trials
for excessive damages more contested. See Nelson, The EighteenthCentury Background of John Marshall's Constitutional Jurisprudence, 76
Mich. L. Rev. 893, 904-917 (1978); M. Horwitz, The Transformation of
American Law, 1780-1860, p. 142 (1977). Nevertheless, because this case
concerns the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, 19thcentury American practice is the "crucial time for present purposes."
Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County of Marin, 495 U. S. 604, 611
(1990). As demonstrated supra, at 424-426, by the time the Fourteenth
Amendment was ratified in 1868, the power of judges to order new trials
for excessive damages was well established in American courts. In addition, the idea that jurors can find law as well as fact is not inconsistent
with judicial review for excessive damages. See Coffin v. Coffin, 4 Mass.
1, 25, 41 (1808).

exemplary damages is an exercise of state power that mustcomply with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth

Amendment. The common-law practice, the procedures ap-plied by every other State, the strong presumption favoring
judicial review that we have applied in other areas of the
law, and elementary considerations of justice all support theconclusion that such a decision should not be committed to

the unreviewable discretion of a jury.The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the
Oregon Supreme Court for further proceedings not incon-sistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia, concurring.
I join the opinion of the Court, but a full explanation of
why requires that I supplement briefly the description of
what has occurred here.

Before the 1910 amendment to Article VII, $ 3, of the Oregon Constitution, Oregon courts had developed and were
applying common-law standards that limited the size of damages awards. See, e. g., Adcock v. Oregon R. Co., 45 Ore.
173, 179-182, 77 P. 78, 80 (1904) (approving trial court's decision to grant a remittitur because the jury's damages award
was excessive); see also Van Lom v. Schneiderman, 187 Ore.
89, 96-98, 112-113, 210 P. 2d 461, 464, 471 (1949). The 1910
amendment, by its terms, did not eliminate those substantive
standards but altered the procedures of judicial review:
"[N]o fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined

in any court of this state, unless the court can affirmatively
say there is no evidence to support the verdict" (emphasis
added). The Oregon courts appear to believe that a statelaw "reasonableness" limit upon the amount of punitive damages subsists, but cannot be enforced through the process
of judicial review. In Van Lom, for example, the Oregon
Supreme Court had no trouble concluding that the damages
award was excessive, see 187 Ore., at 91-93, 210 P. 2d, at

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
462, but held that the amendment had removed its "powerto correct a miscarriage of justice by ordering a new trial,"

id., at 112-113, 210 P. 2d, at 471.The Court's opinion establishes that the right of review
eliminated by the amendment was a procedure tradition-ally accorded at common law. The deprivation of property
without observing (or providing a reasonable substitute for)an important traditional procedure for enforcing stateprescribed limits upon such deprivation violates the DueProcess Clause.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom The Chief Justicejoins, dissenting.
In product liability cases, Oregon guides and limits thefactfinder's discretion on the availability and amount of punitive damages. The plaintiff must establish entitlement topunitive damages, under specific substantive criteria, by
clear and convincing evidence. Where the factfinder is ajury, its decision is subject to judicial review to this extent:
The trial court, or an appellate court, may nullify the verdictif reversible error occurred during the trial, if the jury was
improperly or inadequately instructed, or if there is no evi-dence to support the verdict. Absent trial error, and if
there is evidence to support the award of punitive damages,however, Oregon's Constitution, Article VII, $ 3, provides
that a properly instructed jury's verdict shall not be reexam-ined.

1 Oregon's procedures, I conclude, are adequate to pass

the Constitution's due process threshold. I therefore dis-sent from the Court's judgment upsetting Oregon's disposition in this case.

1 Article VII, $ 3, of the Oregon Constitution reads:
"In actions at law, where the value in controversy shall exceed $200, the
right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall
be otherwise re-examined in any court of this state, unless the court can
affirmatively say there is no evidence to support the verdict."

I
A

To assess the constitutionality of Oregon's scheme, I turn
first to this Court's recent opinions in Pacific Mut. Life Ins.
Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1 (1991), and TXO Production Corp. v.
Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U. S. 443 (1993). The Court
upheld punitive damage awards in both cases, but indicated
that due process imposes an outer limit on remedies of this
type. Significantly, neither decision declared any specific
procedures or substantive criteria essential to satisfy due
process. In Haslip, the Court expressed concerns about
"unlimited jury discretion--or unlimited judicial discretion
for that matter--in the fixing of punitive damages," but refused to "draw a mathematical bright line between the constitutionally acceptable and the constitutionally unacceptable." 499 U. S., at 18. Regarding the components of "the
constitutional calculus," the Court simply referred to "general concerns of reasonableness and [the need for] adequate
guidance from the court when the case is tried to a jury."
Ibid.

And in TXO, a majority agreed that a punitive damage
award may be so grossly excessive as to violate the Due
Process Clause. 509 U. S., at 453-454, 458 (plurality opinion); id., at 466-467 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment); id., at 479-480 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). In the plurality's view, however, "a judgment that
is a product" of "fair procedures . . . is entitled to a strong
presumption of validity"; this presumption, "persuasive reasons" indicated, "should be irrebuttable, . . . or virtually so."
Id., at 457, citing Haslip, 499 U. S., at 24-40 (Scalia, J.,
concurring in judgment), and id., at 40-42 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). The opinion stating the plurality position recalled Haslip's touchstone: A " `concern [for] reasonableness' " is what due process essentially requires. 509

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
U. S., at 458, quoting Haslip, 499 U. S., at 18. Writing forthe plurality,

Justice Stevens explained:

"[W]e do not suggest that a defendant has a substan-tive due process right to a correct determination of the

`reasonableness' of a punitive damages award. As Justice O'Connor points out, state law generally imposesa requirement that punitive damages be `reasonable.'

A violation of a state law `reasonableness' requirementwould not, however, necessarily establish that the award
is so `grossly excessive' as to violate the Federal Consti-tution." 509 U. S., at 458, n. 24 (citation omitted).

B
The procedures Oregon's courts followed in this case sat-isfy the due process limits indicated in

Haslip and TXO; thejurors were adequately guided by the trial court's instructions, and Honda has not maintained, in its full presentationto this Court, that the award in question was "so `grossly
excessive' as to violate the Federal Constitution." TXO,509 U. S., at 458, n. 24.

Several preverdict mechanisms channeled the jury's dis-cretion more tightly in this case than in either

Haslip orTXO. First, providing at least some protection against unguided, utterly arbitrary jury awards, respondent KarlOberg was permitted to recover no more than the amounts
specified in the complaint, $919,390.39 in compensatory dam-ages and $5 million in punitive damages. See Ore. Rule Civ.
Proc. 18B (1994); Wiebe v. Seely, 215 Ore. 331, 355-358, 335P. 2d 379, 391 (1959);

Lovejoy Specialty Hosp. v. Advocatesfor Life, Inc., 121 Ore. App. 160, 167, 855 P. 2d 159, 163 (1993).

The trial court properly instructed the jury on this damage

2 The Supreme Court of Oregon noted that "procedural due process in
the context of an award of punitive damages relates to the requirement
that the procedure employed in making that award be fundamentally fair,"
while the substantive limit declared by this Court relates to the size of
the award. 316 Ore. 263, 280, n. 10, 851 P. 2d 1084, 1094, n. 10 (1993).

cap. See 316 Ore. 263, 282, n. 11, 851 P. 2d 1084, 1095, n. 11(1993). No provision of Oregon law appears to preclude the

defendant from seeking an instruction setting a lower cap, ifthe evidence at trial cannot support an award in the amount
demanded. Additionally, if the trial judge relates the incor-rect maximum amount, a defendant who timely objects may
gain modification or nullification of the verdict. See Timber
Access Industries Co. v. U. S. Plywood-Champion Papers,Inc., 263 Ore. 509, 525-528, 503 P. 2d 482, 490-491 (1972).

Second, Oberg was not allowed to introduce evidenceregarding Honda's wealth until he "presented evidence sufficient to justify to the court a prima facie claim of puni-tive damages." Ore. Rev. Stat. $ 41.315(2) (1991); see also

$ 30.925(2) ("During the course of trial, evidence of the de-fendant's ability to pay shall not be admitted unless and until
the party entitled to recover establishes a prima facie rightto recover [punitive damages]."). This evidentiary rule is
designed to lessen the risk "that juries will use their ver-dicts to express biases against big businesses."

Ante, at432; see also Ore. Rev. Stat. $ 30.925(3)(g) (1991) (requiring

factfinder to take into account "[t]he total deterrent effect ofother punishment imposed upon the defendant as a result
of the misconduct").

Third, and more significant, as the trial court instructedthe jury, Honda could not be found liable for punitive damages unless Oberg established by "clear and convincing evi-dence" that Honda "show[ed] wanton disregard for the health,
safety and welfare of others." $ 30.925 (governing productliability actions); see also $ 41.315(1) ("Except as otherwise
specifically provided by law, a claim for punitive damagesshall be established by clear and convincing evidence.").

3 The Court's contrary suggestion, ante, at 433, is based on Tenold v.
Weyerhaeuser Co., 127 Ore. App. 511, 873 P. 2d 413 (1994), a decision by
an intermediate appellate court, in which the defendant does not appear
to have objected to the trial court's instructions as inaccurate, incomplete,
or insufficient, for failure to inform the jury concerning a statutorily mandated $500,000 cap on noneconomic damages.

"[T]he clear-and-convincing evidence requirement," which isconsiderably more rigorous than the standards applied by

Alabama in Haslip 4 and West Virginia in TXO,5 "constrain[s]the jury's discretion, limiting punitive damages to the more
egregious cases." Haslip, 499 U. S., at 58 (O'Connor, J.,dissenting). Nothing in Oregon law appears to preclude a
new trial order if the trial judge, informed by the jury's ver-dict, determines that his charge did not adequately explain
what the "clear and convincing" standard means. See Ore.Rule Civ. Proc. 64G (1994) (authorizing court to grant new
trial "on its own initiative").Fourth, and perhaps most important, in product liability
cases, Oregon requires that punitive damages, if any, beawarded based on seven substantive criteria, set forth in
Ore. Rev. Stat. $ 30.925(3) (1991):

"(a) The likelihood at the time that serious harm wouldarise from the defendant's misconduct;

"(b) The degree of the defendant's awareness of thatlikelihood;
"(c) The profitability of the defendant's misconduct;
"(d) The duration of the misconduct and any conceal-ment of it;

"(e) The attitude and conduct of the defendant upondiscovery of the misconduct;
"(f) The financial condition of the defendant; and
"(g) The total deterrent effect of other punishment im-posed upon the defendant as a result of the misconduct,

including, but not limited to, punitive damage awards to

These substantive criteria, and the precise instructions de-tailing them,

6 The trial court instructed the jury:
" `Punitive damages: If you have found that plaintiff is entitled to general damages, you must then consider whether to award punitive damages.
Punitive damages may be awarded to the plaintiff in addition to general
damages to punish wrongdoers and to discourage wanton misconduct.

" `In order for plaintiff to recover punitive damages against the defendant[s], the plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence that defendant[s have] shown wanton disregard for the health, safety, and welfare
of others. . . .

" `If you decide this issue against the defendant[s], you may award punitive damages, although you are not required to do so, because punitive
damages are discretionary.

" `In the exercise of that discretion, you shall consider evidence, if any,
of the following:

" `First, the likelihood at the time of the sale [of the all-terrain vehicle]
that serious harm would arise from defendants' misconduct.

" `Number two, the degree of the defendants' awareness of that
likelihood.

" `Number three, the duration of the misconduct.

of the alleged condition of the vehicle.

The trial judge did not instruct the jury on $ 30.925(3)(c), "profitability
of [Honda's] misconduct," or $ 30.925(3)(g), the "total deterrent effect of
other punishment" to which Honda was subject. Honda objected to an
instruction on factor (3)(c), which it argued was phrased "to assume the
existence of misconduct," and expressly waived an instruction on factor (3)(g), on the ground that it had not previously been subject to punitive damages. App. to Brief for Plaintiff-Respondent in Opposition in

than their counterparts in Haslip 7 and TXO 8 received. In
Haslip, for example, the jury was told only the purpose of

7 The trial judge in Haslip instructed the jury:
"Now, if you find that fraud was perpetrated then in addition to compensatory damages you may in your discretion, when I use the word discretion, I say you don't have to even find fraud, you wouldn't have to, but
you may, the law says you may award an amount of money known as
punitive damages.

"This amount of money is awarded to the plaintiff but it is not to compensate the plaintiff for any injury. It is to punish the defendant. Punitive means to punish or it is also called exemplary damages, which means
to make an example. So, if you feel or not feel, but if you are reasonably
satisfied from the evidence that the plaintiff[s] . . . ha[ve] had a fraud
perpetrated upon them and as a direct result they were injured [then]
in addition to compensatory damages you may in your discretion award
punitive damages.

"Now, the purpose of awarding punitive or exemplary damages is to
allow money recovery to the plaintiffs, . . . by way of punishment to the
defendant and for the added purpose of protecting the public by deterring
the defendant and others from doing such wrong in the future. Imposition of punitive damages is entirely discretionary with the jury, that means
you don't have to award it unless this jury feels that you should do so.

"Should you award punitive damages, in fixing the amount, you must
take into consideration the character and the degree of the wrong as
shown by the evidence and necessity of preventing similar wrong." 499
U. S., at 6, n. 1 (internal quotation marks omitted).

" `In addition to actual or compensatory damages, the law permits the
jury, under certain circumstances, to make an award of punitive damages,

punitive damages (punishment and deterrence) and that anaward was discretionary, not compulsory. We deemed those

instructions, notable for their generality, constitutionallysufficient. 499 U. S., at 19-20.

The Court's opinion in Haslip went on to describe thechecks Alabama places on the jury's discretion

postverdict--through excessiveness review by the trial court, and appellate review, which tests the award against specific substan-tive criteria. Id., at 20-23. While postverdict review of
that character is not available in Oregon, the seven factorsagainst which Alabama's Supreme Court tests punitive
awards 9 strongly resemble the statutory criteria Oregon'sjuries are instructed to apply. 316 Ore., at 283, and n. 12,
851 P. 2d, at 1095-1096, and n. 12. And this Court has oftenacknowledged, and generally respected, the presumption
that juries follow the instructions they are given. See, e. g.,
intent of the party committing the act, the wealth of the perpetrator, as
well as any mitigating circumstances which may operate to reduce the
amount of the damages. The object of such punishment is to deter TXO
Production Corp. and others from committing like offenses in the future.
Therefore the law recognizes that to in fact deter such conduct may require a larger fine upon one of large means than it would upon one of
ordinary means under the same or similar circumstances.' " 509 U. S., at
463, n. 29.

9 The Alabama factors are:

"(a) whether there is a reasonable relationship between the punitive damages award and the harm likely to result from the defendant's conduct as
well as the harm that actually has occurred; (b) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct, the duration of that conduct, the defendant's awareness, any concealment, and the existence and frequency of similar past conduct; (c) the profitability to the defendant of the wrongful
conduct and the desirability of removing that profit and of having the
defendant also sustain a loss; (d) the `financial position' of the defendant;
(e) all the costs of litigation; (f) the imposition of criminal sanctions on the
defendant for its conduct, these to be taken in mitigation; and (g) the
existence of other civil awards against the defendant for the same conduct,
these also to be taken in mitigation." 499 U. S., at 21-22, citing Green
Oil Co. v. Hornsby, 539 So. 2d 218, 223-224 (Ala. 1989), and Central Alabama Elec. Cooperative v. Tapley, 546 So. 2d 371, 376-377 (Ala. 1989).

Shannon v. United States, post, at 584-585; Richardson v.Marsh, 481 U. S. 200, 206 (1987).

As the Supreme Court of Oregon observed, Haslip "deter-mined only that the Alabama procedure, as a whole and in
its net effect, did not violate the Due Process Clause." 316Ore., at 284, 851 P. 2d, at 1096. The Oregon court also observed, correctly, that the Due Process Clause does not re-quire States to subject punitive damage awards to a form
of postverdict review "that includes the possibility of remit-titur."

10 Ibid. Because Oregon requires the factfinder to

apply $ 30.925's objective criteria, moreover, its proceduresare perhaps more likely to prompt rational and fair punitive

damage decisions than are the post hoc checks employedin jurisdictions following Alabama's pattern. See

Haslip,499 U. S., at 52 (
O'Connor, J., dissenting) ("[T]he standards[applied by the Alabama Supreme Court] could assist juries

to make fair, rational decisions. Unfortunately, Alabamacourts do not give the[se] factors to the jury. Instead, the
jury has standardless discretion to impose punitive damageswhenever and in whatever amount it wants."). As the
Oregon court concluded, "application of objective criteriaensures that sufficiently definite and meaningful constraints
are imposed on the finder of fact." 316 Ore., at 283, 851P. 2d, at 1096. The Oregon court also concluded that the
statutory criteria, by adequately guiding the jury, worked to"ensur[e] that the resulting award is not disproportionate to
a defendant's conduct and to the need to punish and deter."
Ibid.11

10 Indeed, the compatibility of the remittitur with the Seventh Amendment was not settled until Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S. 474 (1935).

11 Oregon juries, reported decisions indicate, rarely award punitive

damages. Between 1965 and the present, awards of punitive damages
have been reported in only two product liability cases involving Oregon
law, including this one. See Brief for Trial Lawyers for Public Justice as
Amicus Curiae 10, and n. 7. The punitive award in this case was about
5.4 times the amount of compensatory damages and about 258 times the
plaintiff's out-of-pocket expenses. This amount is not far distant from

The Supreme Court of Oregon's conclusions are buttressedby the availability of at least some postverdict judicial review of punitive damage awards. Oregon's courts ensurethat there is evidence to support the verdict:

"If there is no evidence to support the jury's decision--in this context, no evidence that the statutory prerequisites for the award of punitive damages were met--thenthe trial court or the appellate courts can intervene to
vacate the award. See ORCP 64B(5) (trial court maygrant a new trial if the evidence is insufficient to justify
the verdict or is against law); Hill v. Garner, 277 Ore.641, 643, 561 P. 2d 1016 (1977) ( judgment notwithstanding the verdict is to be granted when there is no evi-dence to support the verdict); State v. Brown, 306 Ore.
599, 604, 761 P. 2d 1300 (1988) (a fact decided by a jurymay be re-examined when a reviewing court can say
affirmatively that there is no evidence to support thejury's decision)."

Id., at 285, 851 P. 2d, at 1096-1097.

The State's courts have shown no reluctance to strike puni-tive damage awards in cases where punitive liability is not

established, so that defendant qualifies for judgment on thatissue as a matter of law. See,

e. g., Badger v. Paulson In-vestment Co., 311 Ore. 14, 28-30, 803 P. 2d 1178, 1186-1187

(1991); Andor v. United Airlines, 303 Ore. 505, 739 P. 2d 18(1987); Schmidt v. Pine Tree Land Development Co., 291 Ore.

462, 631 P. 2d 1373 (1981).In addition, punitive damage awards may be set aside because of flaws in jury instructions. 316 Ore., at 285, 851P. 2d, at 1097. See,

e. g., Honeywell v. Sterling Furniture

the award upheld in Haslip, which was more than 4 times the amount of
compensatory damages and more than 200 times the plaintiff's out-ofpocket expenses. See 499 U. S., at 23. The $10 million award this Court
sustained in TXO, in contrast, was more than 526 times greater than the
actual damages of $19,000. 509 U. S., at 453.

II

In short, Oregon has enacted legal standards confining punitive damage awards in product liability cases. These state
standards are judicially enforced by means of comparatively
comprehensive preverdict procedures but markedly limited
postverdict review, for Oregon has elected to make factfinding, once supporting evidence is produced, the province of
the jury. Cf. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Cole, 251 U. S. 54,
56 (1919) (upholding against due process challenge Oklahoma
Constitution's assignment of contributory negligence and
assumption of risk defenses to jury's unreviewable decision;
Court recognized State's prerogative to "confer larger powers upon a jury than those that generally prevail"); Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., 449 U. S. 456, 479 (1981)
(Stevens, J., dissenting) (observing that "allocation of functions within the structure of a state government" is ordinarily "a matter for the State to determine"). The Court
today invalidates this choice, largely because it concludes
that English and early American courts generally provided
judicial review of the size of punitive damage awards. See
ante, at 421-426. The Court's account of the relevant history is not compelling.

A

I am not as confident as the Court about either the clarity
of early American common law or its import. Tellingly, the
Court barely acknowledges the large authority exercised by
American juries in the 18th and 19th centuries. In the early

512us2$82P 12-24-97 12:15:24 PAGES OPINPGT

447Cite as: 512 U. S. 415 (1994)
Ginsburg, J., dissenting
years of our Nation, juries "usually possessed the power todetermine both law and fact." Nelson, The EighteenthCentury Background of John Marshall's Constitutional Juris-prudence, 76 Mich. L. Rev. 893, 905 (1978); see, e. g., Georgia
v. Brailsford, 3 Dall. 1, 4 (1794) (Chief Justice John Jay, try-ing case in which State was party, instructed jury it had
authority "to determine the law as well as the fact in contro-versy").

12 And at the time trial by jury was recognized as

the constitutional right of parties "[i]n [s]uits at commonlaw," U. S. Const., Amdt. 7, the assessment of "uncertain

damages" was regarded, generally, as exclusively a jury function. See Note, Judicial Assessment of Punitive Damages,the Seventh Amendment, and the Politics of Jury Power, 91

Colum. L. Rev. 142, 156, and n. 69 (1991); see also id., at156-158, 163, and n. 112.

More revealing, the Court notably contracts the scope of
its inquiry. It asks: Did common-law judges claim the powerto overturn jury verdicts they viewed as excessive? But

full and fair historical inquiry ought to be wider. The Courtshould inspect, comprehensively and comparatively, the procedures employed--at trial and on appeal--to fix the amountof punitive damages.

13 Evaluated in this manner, Oregon's

scheme affords defendants like Honda more procedural safe-guards than 19th-century law provided.

As detailed supra, at 440-441, Oregon instructs juries todecide punitive damage issues based on seven substantive
factors and a clear and convincing evidence standard. Whenthe Fourteenth Amendment was adopted in 1868, in contrast, "no particular procedures were deemed necessary to
circumscribe a jury's discretion regarding the award of [pu12 Not until Sparf v. United States, 156 U. S. 51, 102 (1895), was the jury's
power to decide the law conclusively rejected for the federal courts. See
Riggs, Constitutionalizing Punitive Damages: The Limits of Due Process,
52 Ohio St. L. J. 859, 900 (1991).

13 An inquiry of this order is akin to the one made in Haslip. See supra,

at 443-444.

nitive] damages, or their amount." Haslip, 499 U. S., at
27 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). The responsibility
entrusted to the jury surely was not guided by instructions
of the kind Oregon has enacted. Compare 1 J. Sutherland,
Law of Damages 720 (1882) ("If, in committing the wrong
complained of, [the defendant] acted recklessly, or wilfully
and maliciously, with a design to oppress and injure the
plaintiff, the jury in fixing the damages may disregard the
rule of compensation; and, beyond that, may, as a punishment
of the defendant, and as a protection to society against a
violation of personal rights and social order, award such additional damages as in their discretion they may deem
proper."), with Ore. Rev. Stat. $ 30-925 (1991) (requiring jury
to consider, inter alia, "likelihood at the time that serious
harm would arise from the defendant's misconduct"; "degree
of the defendant's awareness of that likelihood"; "profitability
of the defendant's misconduct"; "duration of the misconduct
and any concealment of it").

Furthermore, common-law courts reviewed punitive damage verdicts extremely deferentially, if at all. See, e. g., Day
v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371 (1852) (assessment of "exemplary, punitive, or vindictive damages . . . has been always
left to the discretion of the jury, as the degree of punishment
to be thus inflicted must depend on the peculiar circumstances of each case"); Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Humes, 115
U. S. 512, 521 (1885) ("[t]he discretion of the jury in such
cases is not controlled by any very definite rules"); Barry v.
Edmunds, 116 U. S. 550, 565 (1886) (in "actions for torts
where no precise rule of law fixes the recoverable damages,
it is the peculiar function of the jury to determine the
amount by their verdict"). True, 19th-century judges occasionally asserted that they had authority to overturn damage
awards upon concluding, from the size of an award, that the
jury's decision must have been based on "partiality" or "passion and prejudice." Ante, at 425. But courts rarely exer512us2$82P 12-24-97 12:15:24 PAGES OPINPGT

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
cised this authority. See T. Sedgwick, Measure of Damages707 (5th ed. 1869) (power "very sparingly used").

B
Because Oregon's procedures assure "adequate guidancefrom the court when the case is tried to a jury," Haslip, 499

U. S., at 18, this Court has no cause to disturb the judgmentin this instance, for Honda presses here only a

proceduraldue process claim. True, in a footnote to its petition for certiorari, not repeated in its briefs, Honda attributed to thisCourt an "assumption that procedural due process requires
[ judicial] review of both federal substantive due process andstate-law excessiveness challenges to the size of an award."
Pet. for Cert. 16, n. 10 (emphasis in original). But the as-sertion regarding "state-law excessiveness challenges" is
extraordinary, for this Court has never held that the DueProcess Clause requires a State's courts to police jury
factfindings to ensure their conformity with state law. See
Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Cole, 251 U. S., at 56. And,as earlier observed, see supra, at 438, the plurality opinion

in TXO disavowed the suggestion that a defendant has afederal due process right to a correct determination under
state law of the "reasonableness" of a punitive damagesaward. 509 U. S., at 458, n. 24.

Honda further asserted in its certiorari petition footnote:

"Surely . . . due process (not to mention SupremacyClause principles) requires, at a minimum, that state

courts entertain and pass on the federal-law contentionthat a particular punitive verdict is so grossly excessive
as to violate substantive due process. Oregon's refusalto provide even that limited form of review is particularly indefensible." Pet. for Cert. 16, n. 10.
But Honda points to no definitive Oregon pronouncementpostdating this Court's precedent-setting decisions in

Haslip

and TXO demonstrating the hypothesized refusal to pass ona federal-law contention.

14

It may be that Oregon's procedures guide juries so wellthat the "grossly excessive" verdict Honda projects in its

certiorari petition footnote never materializes. Cf. supra, at444, n. 11 (between 1965 and the present, awards of punitive
damages in Oregon have been reported in only two product
liability cases, including this one). If, however, in some fu-ture case, a plea is plausibly made that a particular punitive

damage award is not merely excessive, but "so `grossly ex-cessive' as to violate the Federal Constitution,"

TXO, 509
U. S., at 458, n. 24, and Oregon's judiciary nevertheless in-sists that it is powerless to consider the plea, this Court

might have cause to grant review. Cf. Testa v. Katt, 330
U. S. 386 (1947) (ruling on obligation of state courts to en-force federal law). No such case is before us today, nor does

Honda, in this Court, maintain otherwise. See 316 Ore., at
286, n. 14, 851 P. 2d, at 1097, n. 14; supra, at 444-445, n. 11
(size of award against Honda does not appear to be out of
line with awards upheld in Haslip and TXO).

To summarize: Oregon's procedures adequately guide the
jury charged with the responsibility to determine a plaintiff 's qualification for, and the amount of, punitive damages,
and on that account do not deny defendants procedural due
process; Oregon's Supreme Court correctly refused to rule
that "an award of punitive damages, to comport with the
requirements of the Due Process Clause, always must be
subject to a form of post-verdict or appellate review" for
excessiveness, 316 Ore., at 284, 851 P. 2d, at 1096 (emphasis

14 In its 1949 decision in Van Lom v. Schneiderman, 187 Ore. 89, 210
P. 2d 461, the Supreme Court of Oregon merely held that it lacked authority to order a new trial even though an award of damages was excessive
under state law. See ante, at 435-436 (Scalia, J., concurring). No federal limit had yet been recognized, and the Van Lom court had no occasion
to consider its obligation to check jury verdicts deemed excessive under
federal law.

added); the verdict in this particular case, considered in lightof this Court's decisions in Haslip and TXO, hardly appears

"so `grossly excessive' as to violate the substantive com-ponent of the Due Process Clause," TXO, 509 U. S., at 458.
Accordingly, the Court's procedural directive to the statecourt is neither necessary nor proper. The Supreme Court
of Oregon has not refused to enforce federal law, and Iwould affirm its judgment.

DAVIS v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court ofmilitary appeals

No. 92-1949. Argued March 29, 1994--Decided June 24, 1994
Petitioner, a member of the United States Navy, initially waived his rights

to remain silent and to counsel when he was interviewed by Naval Investigative Service agents in connection with the murder of a sailor.
About an hour and a half into the interview, he said, "Maybe I should
talk to a lawyer." However, when the agents inquired if he was asking
for a lawyer, he replied that he was not. They took a short break, he
was reminded of his rights, and the interview continued for another
hour, until he asked to have a lawyer present before saying anything
more. A military judge denied his motion to suppress statements made
at the interview, holding that his mention of a lawyer during the interrogation was not a request for counsel. He was convicted of murder, and,
ultimately, the Court of Military Appeals affirmed.

Held:

1. After a knowing and voluntary waiver of rights under Miranda v.
Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, law enforcement officers may continue questioning until and unless a suspect clearly requests an attorney. A suspect
is entitled to the assistance of counsel during custodial interrogation
even though the Constitution does not provide for such assistance. Id.,
at 469-473. If the suspect invokes that right at any time, the police
must immediately cease questioning him until an attorney is present.
Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, 484-485. The Edwards rule serves
the prophylactic purpose of preventing officers from badgering a suspect
into waiving his previously asserted Miranda rights, and its applicability requires courts to determine whether the accused actually invoked
his right to counsel. This is an objective inquiry, requiring some statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire
for an attorney's assistance. However, if a reference is ambiguous or
equivocal in that a reasonable officer in light of the circumstances would
have understood only that the suspect might be invoking the right to
counsel, Edwards does not require that officers stop questioning the
suspect. Extending Edwards to create such a requirement would
transform the Miranda safeguards into wholly irrational obstacles to
legitimate investigative activity by needlessly preventing the police
from questioning a suspect in the absence of an attorney, even if the

Syllabus
suspect does not wish to have one present. The Edwards rule provides
a bright line that can be applied by officers in the real world of investigation and interrogation without unduly hampering the gathering of information. This clarity and ease of application would be lost if officers
were required to cease questioning based on an ambiguous or equivocal
reference to an attorney, since they would be forced to make difficult
judgment calls about what the suspect wants, with the threat of suppression if they guess wrong. While it will often be good police practice for officers to clarify whether a suspect making an ambiguous statement really wants an attorney, they are not required to ask clarifying
questions. Pp. 456-462.

2. There is no reason to disturb the conclusion of the courts below
that petitioner's remark--"Maybe I should talk to a lawyer"--was not
a request for counsel. P. 462.

454 DAVIS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
In Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981), we held thatlaw enforcement officers must immediately cease questioning a suspect who has clearly asserted his right to have coun-sel present during custodial interrogation. In this case we
decide how law enforcement officers should respond whena suspect makes a reference to counsel that is insufficiently clear to invoke the Edwards prohibition on furtherquestioning.

Pool brought trouble--not to River City, but to theCharleston Naval Base. Petitioner, a member of the United

States Navy, spent the evening of October 2, 1988, shootingpool at a club on the base. Another sailor, Keith Shackleton,
lost a game and a $30 wager to petitioner, but Shackle-ton refused to pay. After the club closed, Shackleton was
beaten to death with a pool cue on a loading dock behind thecommissary. The body was found early the next morning.

The investigation by the Naval Investigative Service(NIS) gradually focused on petitioner. Investigative agents
determined that petitioner was at the club that evening, andthat he was absent without authorization from his duty
station the next morning. The agents also learned that onlyprivately owned pool cues could be removed from the club
premises, and that petitioner owned two cues--one of whichhad a bloodstain on it. The agents were told by various
people that petitioner either had admitted committing thecrime or had recounted details that clearly indicated his
involvement in the killing.On November 4, 1988, petitioner was interviewed at the
NIS office. As required by military law, the agents advisedpetitioner that he was a suspect in the killing, that he was
not required to make a statement, that any statement couldbe used against him at a trial by court-martial, and that he
was entitled to speak with an attorney and have an attorneypresent during questioning. See Art. 31, Uniform Code of

waived his rights to remain silent and to counsel, both orally
and in writing.

About an hour and a half into the interview, petitioner
said, "Maybe I should talk to a lawyer." App. 135. According to the uncontradicted testimony of one of the interviewing agents, the interview then proceeded as follows:

"[We m]ade it very clear that we're not here to violate
his rights, that if he wants a lawyer, then we will stop
any kind of questioning with him, that we weren't going
to pursue the matter unless we have it clarified is he
asking for a lawyer or is he just making a comment
about a lawyer, and he said, [`]No, I'm not asking for a
lawyer,' and then he continued on, and said, `No, I don't
want a lawyer.' " Id., at 136.

After a short break, the agents reminded petitioner of his
rights to remain silent and to counsel. The interview then
continued for another hour, until petitioner said, "I think I
want a lawyer before I say anything else." Id., at 137. At
that point, questioning ceased.

At his general court-martial, petitioner moved to suppress
statements made during the November 4 interview. The
Military Judge denied the motion, holding that "the mention
of a lawyer by [petitioner] during the course of the interrogation [was] not in the form of a request for counsel and . . .
the agents properly determined that [petitioner] was not indicating a desire for or invoking his right to counsel." Id.,

Marine Corps Court of Military Review affirmed. App. toPet. for Cert. 12a-15a.

The United States Court of Military Appeals granted dis-cretionary review and affirmed. 36 M. J. 337 (1993). The
court recognized that the state and federal courts have de-veloped three different approaches to a suspect's ambiguous
or equivocal request for counsel:

"Some jurisdictions have held that any mention ofcounsel, however ambiguous, is sufficient to require that

all questioning cease. Others have attempted to definea threshold standard of clarity for invoking the right to

jurisdictions . . . have held that all interrogation aboutthe offense must immediately cease whenever a suspect
mentions counsel, but they allow interrogators to asknarrow questions designed to clarify the earlier statement and the [suspect's] desires respecting counsel."

Applying the third approach, the court held that petitioner'scomment was ambiguous, and that the NIS agents properly clarified petitioner's wishes with respect to counsel be-fore continuing questioning him about the offense.

Although we have twice previously noted the varying ap-proaches the lower courts have adopted with respect to ambiguous or equivocal references to counsel during custodialinterrogation, see

Opinion of the Court
States v. Gouveia, 467 U. S. 180, 188 (1984), and before pro-ceedings are initiated a suspect in a criminal investigation

has no constitutional right to the assistance of counsel.Nevertheless, we held in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436,
469-473 (1966), that a suspect subject to custodial interroga-tion has the right to consult with an attorney and to have
counsel present during questioning, and that the police mustexplain this right to him before questioning begins. The
right to counsel established in Miranda was one of a "seriesof recommended `procedural safeguards' . . . [that] were not
themselves rights protected by the Constitution but wereinstead measures to insure that the right against compulsory
self-incrimination was protected." Michigan v. Tucker, 417U. S. 433, 443-444 (1974); see U. S. Const., Amdt. 5 ("No
person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be awitness against himself ").*

*We have never had occasion to consider whether the Fifth Amendment
privilege against self-incrimination, or the attendant right to counsel during custodial interrogation, applies of its own force to the military, and we
need not do so here. The President, exercising his authority to prescribe
procedures for military criminal proceedings, see Art. 36(a), UCMJ, 10
U. S. C. $ 836(a), has decreed that statements obtained in violation of the
Self-Incrimination Clause are generally not admissible at trials by courtmartial. Mil. Rules Evid. 304(a) and (c)(3). Because the Court of Military Appeals has held that our cases construing the Fifth Amendment
right to counsel apply to military interrogations and control the admissibility of evidence at trials by court-martial, see, e. g., United States v. McLaren, 38 M. J. 112, 115 (1993); United States v. Applewhite, 23 M. J. 196,
198 (1987), and the parties do not contest this point, we proceed on the
assumption that our precedents apply to courts-martial just as they apply
to state and federal criminal prosecutions.

We also note that the Government has not sought to rely in this case on
18 U. S. C. $ 3501, "the statute governing the admissibility of confessions
in federal prosecutions," United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez, 511 U. S. 350,

are reluctant to do so when the issue is one of first impression involving

458 DAVIS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
The right to counsel recognized in Miranda is sufficientlyimportant to suspects in criminal investigations, we have

held, that it "requir[es] the special protection of the knowingand intelligent waiver standard." Edwards v. Arizona, 451
U. S., at 483. See Oregon v. Bradshaw, 462 U. S. 1039, 1046-1047 (1983) (plurality opinion);

id., at 1051 (Powell, J., concur-ring in judgment). If the suspect effectively waives his

right to counsel after receiving the Miranda warnings, lawenforcement officers are free to question him. North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U. S. 369, 372-376 (1979). But if a sus-pect requests counsel at any time during the interview, he is
not subject to further questioning until a lawyer has beenmade available or the suspect himself reinitiates conversation. Edwards v. Arizona, supra, at 484-485. This "sec-ond layer of prophylaxis for the

Miranda right to counsel,"McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 176 (1991), is "designed

to prevent police from badgering a defendant into waivinghis previously asserted Miranda rights," Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U. S. 344, 350 (1990). To that end, we have heldthat a suspect who has invoked the right to counsel cannot
be questioned regarding any offense unless an attorney isactually present.

Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 146(1990); Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675 (1988). "It remains clear, however, that this prohibition on further ques-tioning--like other aspects of Miranda--is not itself required by the Fifth Amendment's prohibition on coercedconfessions, but is instead justified only by reference to its
prophylactic purpose." Connecticut v. Barrett, supra, at528.

The applicability of the " `rigid' prophylactic rule" of Edwards requires courts to "determine whether the accusedactually invoked his right to counsel." Smith v. Illinois,

supra, at 95 (emphasis added), quoting Fare v. Michael C.,442 U. S. 707, 719 (1979). To avoid difficulties of proof and to

Opinion of the Court
provide guidance to officers conducting interrogations, this isan objective inquiry. See

Connecticut v. Barrett, supra, at
529. Invocation of the Miranda right to counsel "requires,at a minimum, some statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance of
an attorney." McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S., at 178. Butif a suspect makes a reference to an attorney that is ambiguous or equivocal in that a reasonable officer in light of thecircumstances would have understood only that the suspect
might be invoking the right to counsel, our precedents donot require the cessation of questioning. See

ibid. ("[T]he
likelihood that a suspect would wish counsel to be present
is not the test for applicability of Edwards"); Edwards v.
Arizona, supra, at 485 (impermissible for authorities "to reinterrogate an accused in custody if he has clearly asserted
his right to counsel") (emphasis added).

Rather, the suspect must unambiguously request counsel.
As we have observed, "a statement either is such an assertion of the right to counsel or it is not." Smith v. Illinois,
469 U. S., at 97-98 (brackets and internal quotation marks
omitted). Although a suspect need not "speak with the discrimination of an Oxford don," post, at 476 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment), he must articulate his desire to have
counsel present sufficiently clearly that a reasonable police
officer in the circumstances would understand the statement
to be a request for an attorney. If the statement fails to
meet the requisite level of clarity, Edwards does not require
that the officers stop questioning the suspect. See Moran
v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 433, n. 4 (1986) ("[T]he interrogation must cease until an attorney is present only [i]f the
individual states that he wants an attorney") (citations and
internal quotation marks omitted).

We decline petitioner's invitation to extend Edwards and
require law enforcement officers to cease questioning immediately upon the making of an ambiguous or equivocal reference to an attorney. See Arizona v. Roberson, supra, at 688

460 DAVIS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
(Kennedy, J., dissenting) ("[T]he rule of Edwards is ourrule, not a constitutional command; and it is our obligation

to justify its expansion"). The rationale underlying Edwards is that the police must respect a suspect's wishes
regarding his right to have an attorney present during custodial interrogation. But when the officers conducting thequestioning reasonably do not know whether or not the suspect wants a lawyer, a rule requiring the immediate cessa-tion of questioning "would transform the

Miranda safeguards into wholly irrational obstacles to legitimate policeinvestigative activity,"

Michigan v. Mosley, 423 U. S. 96, 102
(1975), because it would needlessly prevent the police from
questioning a suspect in the absence of counsel even if the
suspect did not wish to have a lawyer present. Nothing in
Edwards requires the provision of counsel to a suspect who
consents to answer questions without the assistance of a lawyer. In Miranda itself, we expressly rejected the suggestion "that each police station must have a `station house lawyer' present at all times to advise prisoners," 384 U. S., at
474, and held instead that a suspect must be told of his right
to have an attorney present and that he may not be questioned after invoking his right to counsel. We also noted
that if a suspect is "indecisive in his request for counsel," the
officers need not always cease questioning. See id., at 485.

We recognize that requiring a clear assertion of the right
to counsel might disadvantage some suspects who--because
of fear, intimidation, lack of linguistic skills, or a variety of
other reasons--will not clearly articulate their right to counsel although they actually want to have a lawyer present.
But the primary protection afforded suspects subject to custodial interrogation is the Miranda warnings themselves.
"[F]ull comprehension of the rights to remain silent and request an attorney [is] sufficient to dispel whatever coercion is
inherent in the interrogation process." Moran v. Burbine,
supra, at 427. A suspect who knowingly and voluntarily
waives his right to counsel after having that right explained

Opinion of the Court
to him has indicated his willingness to deal with the policeunassisted. Although

Edwards provides an additional protection--if a suspect subsequently requests an attorney,questioning must cease--it is one that must be affirmatively

invoked by the suspect.

In considering how a suspect must invoke the right tocounsel, we must consider the other side of the

Miranda
equation: the need for effective law enforcement. Althoughthe courts ensure compliance with the

Miranda requirements through the exclusionary rule, it is police officers whomust actually decide whether or not they can question a suspect. The Edwards rule--questioning must cease if the
suspect asks for a lawyer--provides a bright line that can
be applied by officers in the real world of investigation and
interrogation without unduly hampering the gathering of information. But if we were to require questioning to cease
if a suspect makes a statement that might be a request for
an attorney, this clarity and ease of application would be lost.
Police officers would be forced to make difficult judgment
calls about whether the suspect in fact wants a lawyer even
though he has not said so, with the threat of suppression if
they guess wrong. We therefore hold that, after a knowing
and voluntary waiver of the Miranda rights, law enforcement officers may continue questioning until and unless the
suspect clearly requests an attorney.

Of course, when a suspect makes an ambiguous or equivocal statement it will often be good police practice for the
interviewing officers to clarify whether or not he actually
wants an attorney. That was the procedure followed by the
NIS agents in this case. Clarifying questions help protect
the rights of the suspect by ensuring that he gets an attorney if he wants one, and will minimize the chance of a confession being suppressed due to subsequent judicial secondguessing as to the meaning of the suspect's statement
regarding counsel. But we decline to adopt a rule requiring
officers to ask clarifying questions. If the suspect's state512us2$83J 12-24-97 12:19:03 PAGES OPINPGT

Scalia, J., concurring
ment is not an unambiguous or unequivocal request for coun-sel, the officers have no obligation to stop questioning him.

To recapitulate: We held in Miranda that a suspect is enti-tled to the assistance of counsel during custodial interrogation even though the Constitution does not provide for suchassistance. We held in

Edwards that if the suspect invokesthe right to counsel at any time, the police must immediately

cease questioning him until an attorney is present. But weare unwilling to create a third layer of prophylaxis to prevent police questioning when the suspect might want a law-yer. Unless the suspect actually requests an attorney, questioning may continue.The courts below found that petitioner's remark to the
NIS agents--"Maybe I should talk to a lawyer"--was not arequest for counsel, and we see no reason to disturb that
conclusion. The NIS agents therefore were not required tostop questioning petitioner, though it was entirely proper for
them to clarify whether petitioner in fact wanted a lawyer.Because there is no ground for suppression of petitioner's
statements, the judgment of the Court of Military Appeals is

Affirmed.
Justice Scalia, concurring.
Section 3501 of Title 18 of the United States Code is "thestatute governing the admissibility of confessions in federal

prosecutions." United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez, 511 U. S.350, 351 (1994). That provision declares that "a confession
. . . shall be admissible in evidence if it is voluntarilygiven," and that the issue of voluntariness shall be determined on the basis of "all the circumstances surrounding thegiving of the confession, including whether or not [the] defendant was advised or knew that he was not required tomake any statement . . . [;] . . . whether or not [the] defendant
had been advised prior to questioning of his right to the as-sistance of counsel; and . . . whether or not [the] defendant
was without the assistance of counsel when questioned . . . ."

$$ 3501(a), (b) (emphases added). It continues (lest the im-port be doubtful): "The presence or absence of any of the

above-mentioned factors . . . need not be conclusive on theissue of voluntariness of the confession." $ 3501(b). Legal
analysis of the admissibility of a confession without referenceto these provisions is equivalent to legal analysis of the admissibility of hearsay without consulting the Rules of Evi-dence; it is an unreal exercise. Yet as the Court observes,
see ante, at 457-458, n., that is precisely what the UnitedStates has undertaken in this case. It did not raise $ 3501(a)
below and asserted that it is "not at issue" here, Brief forUnited States 18, n. 13.*

This is not the first case in which the United States hasdeclined to invoke $ 3501 before us--nor even the first case
in which that failure has been called to its attention. SeeTr. of Oral Arg. in United States v. Green, O. T. 1992, No.
91-1521, pp. 18-21. In fact, with limited exceptions the

*The United States makes the unusually self-denying assertion that the
provision "in any event would appear not to be applicable in court-martial
cases" since (1) court-martial cases are not " `criminal prosecutions' "
within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment and "therefore would not
appear to be `criminal prosecution[s]' for purposes of Section 3501(a)," and
(2) courts-martial are governed by Article 31 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U. S. C. $ 831, and Rules 304 and 305 of the Military Rules
of Evidence. The first point seems to me questionable: The meaning of
terms in statutes does not necessarily parallel their meaning in the Constitution. Moreover, even accepting the premise that $ 3501 does not apply
to courts-martial directly, it does apply indirectly, through Rule 101(b)(1)
of the Military Rules of Evidence, which requires courts-martial to apply
"the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases
in the United States district courts." As for the second point: The cited
provisions of the Uniform Code and the Military Rules may (though I
doubt it) be independent reasons why the confession here should be excluded, but they cannot possibly be reasons why $ 3501 does not prevent
Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), from being a basis for excluding
them, which is the issue before us. In any event, the Court today bases
its refusal to consider $ 3501 not upon the fact that the provision is inapplicable, but upon the fact that the Government failed to argue it--and it is
that refusal which my present statement addresses.

provision has been studiously avoided by every Administra-tion, not only in this Court but in the lower courts, since its

enactment more than 25 years ago. See Office of LegalPolicy, U. S. Dept. of Justice, Report to Attorney General
on Law of Pre-Trial Interrogation 72-73 (1986) (discussing
"[t]he abortive implementation of $ 3501" after its passagein 1968).

I agree with the Court that it is proper, given the Govern-ment's failure to raise the point, to render judgment without
taking account of $ 3501. But the refusal to consider argu-ments not raised is a sound prudential practice, rather than
a statutory or constitutional mandate, and there are times
when prudence dictates the contrary. See United States
Nat. Bank of Ore. v. Independent Ins. Agents of America,
Inc., 508 U. S. 439, 445-448 (1993) (proper for Court of Appeals to consider whether an allegedly controlling statute
had been repealed, despite parties' failure, upon invitation,
to assert the point). As far as I am concerned, such a time
will have arrived when a case that comes within the terms
of this statute is next presented to us.

For most of this century, voluntariness vel non was the
touchstone of admissibility of confessions. See Miranda v.
Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 506-507 (1966) (Harlan, J., dissenting). Section 3501 of Title 18 seems to provide for that
standard in federal criminal prosecutions today. I say
"seems" because I do not wish to prejudge any issue of law.
I am entirely open to the argument that $ 3501 does not mean
what it appears to say; that it is inapplicable for some other
reason; or even that it is unconstitutional. But I will no
longer be open to the argument that this Court should continue to ignore the commands of $ 3501 simply because the
Executive declines to insist that we observe them.

The Executive has the power (whether or not it has the
right) effectively to nullify some provisions of law by the
mere failure to prosecute--the exercise of so-called prosecutorial discretion. And it has the power (whether or not it

Scalia, J., concurring
has the right) to avoid application of $ 3501 by simply declin-ing to introduce into evidence confessions admissible under

its terms. But once a prosecution has been commenced anda confession introduced, the Executive assuredly has neither
the power nor the right to determine what objections to admissibility of the confession are valid in law. Section $ 3501of Title 18 is a provision of law directed

to the courts, reflecting the people's assessment of the proper balance to bestruck between concern for persons interrogated in custody

and the needs of effective law enforcement. We shirk ourduty if we systematically disregard that statutory command
simply because the Justice Department systematically declines to remind us of it.

The United States' repeated refusal to invoke $ 3501, combined with the courts' traditional (albeit merely prudential)
refusal to consider arguments not raised, has caused the federal judiciary to confront a host of "Miranda" issues that
might be entirely irrelevant under federal law. See, e. g., in
addition to the present case, United States v. Green, 507 U. S.
545 (1993) (dism'g cert. as moot); United States v. Griffin, 922
F. 2d 1343 (CA8 1990); United States v. Vazquez, 857 F. 2d
857 (CA1 1988); United States v. Scalf, 725 F. 2d 1272 (CA10
1984). Worse still, it may have produced--during an era of
intense national concern about the problem of runaway
crime--the acquittal and the nonprosecution of many dangerous felons, enabling them to continue their depredations
upon our citizens. There is no excuse for this. Perhaps
(though I do not immediately see why) the Justice Department has good basis for believing that allowing prosecutions
to be defeated on grounds that could be avoided by invocation of $ 3501 is consistent with the Executive's obligation to
"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed," U. S.
Const., Art. II, $ 3. That is not the point. The point is
whether our continuing refusal to consider $ 3501 is consistent with the Third Branch's obligation to decide according to
the law. I think it is not.

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
Justice Souter, with whom Justice Blackmun, Justice Stevens, and Justice Ginsburg join, concurring inthe judgment.

In the midst of his questioning by naval investigators, peti-tioner said "Maybe I should talk to a lawyer." The investigators promptly stopped questioning Davis about the killingof Keith Shackleton and instead undertook to determine
whether he meant to invoke his right to counsel, see Mi-randa v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). According to testimony accepted by the courts below, Davis answered theinvestigators' questions on that point by saying, "I'm not
asking for a lawyer," and "No, I don't want to talk to a law-yer." Only then did the interrogation resume (stopping for
good when petitioner said, "I think I want a lawyer before Isay anything else").

I agree with the majority that the Constitution does notforbid law enforcement officers to pose questions (like those
directed at Davis) aimed solely at clarifying whether a sus-pect's ambiguous reference to counsel was meant to assert
his Fifth Amendment right. Accordingly I concur in thejudgment affirming Davis's conviction, resting partly on evidence of statements given after agents ascertained that hedid not wish to deal with them through counsel. I cannot,
however, join in my colleagues' further conclusion that if theinvestigators here had been so inclined, they were at liberty
to disregard Davis's reference to a lawyer entirely, in accord-ance with a general rule that interrogators have no legal
obligation to discover what a custodial subject meant by anambiguous statement that could reasonably be understood to
express a desire to consult a lawyer.Our own precedent, the reasonable judgments of the majority of the many courts already to have addressed the issuebefore us,

enforcement officials 2 are to the contrary. All argue againstthe Court's approach today, which draws a sharp line between interrogated suspects who "clearly" assert their rightto counsel, ante, at 461, and those who say something that
may, but may not, express a desire for counsel's presence,the former suspects being assured that questioning will not
resume without counsel present, see Miranda, supra, at 474,
Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, 484-485 (1981); Minnickv. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 146 (1990), the latter being left to

fend for themselves. The concerns of fairness and practical-ity that have long anchored our Miranda case law point to a
different response: when law enforcement officials "reason-ably do not know whether or not the suspect wants a lawyer," ante, at 460, they should stop their interrogation andask him to make his choice clear.

While the question we address today is an open one,3 itsanswer requires coherence with nearly three decades of case

1467, 1472 (CA11 1992); see also Howard v. Pung, 862 F. 2d 1348 (CA8
1988). The weight of state-court authority is similarly lopsided, see, e. g.,
People v. Benjamin, 732 P. 2d 1167, 1171 (Colo. 1987); Crawford v. State,
580 A. 2d 571, 576-577 (Del. 1990); Martinez v. State, 564 So. 2d 1071, 1074

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
law addressing the relationship between police and criminalsuspects in custodial interrogation. Throughout that period, two precepts have commanded broad assent: that the
(1993) (White, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari), but then suggests
that the conclusion it reaches was foreshadowed by McNeil v. Wisconsin,
501 U. S. 171 (1991), where we noted that the "likelihood that a suspect
would wish counsel to be present" was not dispositive, id., at 178. But
we were not addressing the degree of clarity required to activate the counsel right (let alone endorsing the standard embraced today), as is evident
from the very page of McNeil cited, where we were careful to say only
that the Miranda counsel right "requires, at a minimum, some statement
that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the
assistance of an attorney." 501 U. S., at 178. McNeil instead made the
different and familiar point that courts may not presume that a silent
defendant "would" want a lawyer whenever circumstances suggest that
representation "would" be in his interest.

Nor may this case be disposed of by italicizing the words of Edwards v.
Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, 485 (1981), to the effect that when a suspect
"clearly assert[s]" his right, questioning must cease. See ante, at 459.
Even putting aside that the particular statement in that case was not
entirely clear (the highest court to address the question described it as
"equivocal," see State v. Edwards, 122 Ariz. 206, 211, 594 P. 2d 72, 77
(1979); see also 451 U. S., at 480, n. 6), Edwards no more decided the legal
consequences of a less than "clear" statement than Miranda, by saying
that explicit waivers are sufficient, 384 U. S., at 475, settled whether they
are necessary. See North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U. S. 369, 373 (1979)
(holding they are not). Were it otherwise, there would have been no reason after Edwards to identify the issue as unresolved, but see Barrett,
supra; Smith v. Illinois, 469 U. S. 91, 95-96 (1984) (per curiam).

Nor, finally, is it plausible to read Miranda itself as a presage of the
Court's rule, on account of language suggesting that questioning need not
stop when a request for counsel is " `indecisive.' " Ante, at 460 (quoting
Miranda, 384 U. S., at 485). The statement quoted, however, is not taken
from the Court's holding, but rather from a lengthy direct quotation of a
letter to the Court from the Solicitor General, purporting to summarize
then-current FBI practice (which the Court observed was "consistent,"
id., at 484, with the rule announced). In any event, the letter further
explains that, under the FBI policy, the "indecisive" suspect may be "question[ed] on whether he did or did not waive counsel," id., at 485, an approach closer to the one advocated here than to the one the Court adopts.

Miranda safeguards exist " `to assure that the individual'sright to choose between speech and silence remains unfettered throughout the interrogation process,' " see Connecti-cut v. Barrett, 479 U. S. 523, 528 (1987) (quoting Miranda,
384 U. S., at 469, and supplying emphasis), and that the justi-fication for

Miranda rules, intended to operate in the realworld, "must be consistent with . . . practical realities," Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675, 688 (1988) (Kennedy, J.,dissenting). A rule barring government agents from further interrogation until they determine whether a suspect'sambiguous statement was meant as a request for counsel
fulfills both ambitions. It assures that a suspect's choicewhether or not to deal with police through counsel will be
"scrupulously honored," Miranda, supra, at 479; cf. Michigan v. Mosley, 423 U. S. 96, 110, n. 2 (1975) (White, J., concur-ring in result), and it faces both the real-world reasons why

misunderstandings arise between suspect and interrogatorand the real-world limitations on the capacity of police and
trial courts to apply fine distinctions and intricate rules.

B
Tested against the same two principles, the approach theCourt adopts does not fare so well. First, as the majority

expressly acknowledges, see ante, at 460, criminal suspectswho may (in Miranda's words) be "thrust into an unfamiliar
atmosphere and run through menacing police interrogationprocedures," 384 U. S., at 457, would seem an odd group to
single out for the Court's demand of heightened linguisticcare. A substantial percentage of them lack anything like a
confident command of the English language, see, e. g., United
States v. De la Jara, 973 F. 2d 746, 750 (CA9 1992); many are"woefully ignorant,"

Miranda, supra, at 468; cf. Davis v.
North Carolina, 384 U. S. 737, 742 (1966); and many morewill be sufficiently intimidated by the interrogation process

or overwhelmed by the uncertainty of their predicament that

470 DAVIS v. UNITED STATES

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
the ability to speak assertively will abandon them.4 Indeed,
the awareness of just these realities has, in the past, dissuaded the Court from placing any burden of clarity upon
individuals in custody, but has led it instead to require that
requests for counsel be "give[n] a broad, rather than a narrow, interpretation," see Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625,
633 (1986); Barrett, supra, at 529, and that courts "indulge
every reasonable presumption," Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S.
458, 464 (1938) (internal quotation marks omitted), that a
suspect has not waived his right to counsel under Miranda,
see, e. g., Oregon v. Bradshaw, 462 U. S. 1039, 1051 (1983)

(Powell, J., concurring) ("We are unanimous in agreeing . . .
that the [Miranda] right to counsel is a prime example of
those rights requiring the special protection of the knowing
and intelligent waiver standard") (internal quotation marks
and brackets omitted); cf. Minnick, 498 U. S., at 160 (Scalia,
J., dissenting) ("[W]e have adhered to the principle that
nothing less than the Zerbst standard" is appropriate for
Miranda waivers).

Nor may the standard governing waivers as expressed in
these statements be deflected away by drawing a distinction
between initial waivers of Miranda rights and subsequent

4 Social science confirms what common sense would suggest, that individuals who feel intimidated or powerless are more likely to speak in
equivocal or nonstandard terms when no ambiguity or equivocation is
meant. See W. O'Barr, Linguistic Evidence: Language, Power, and Strategy in the Courtroom 61-71 (1982). Suspects in police interrogation are
strong candidates for these effects. Even while resort by the police to the
"third degree" has abated since Miranda, the basic forms of psychological
pressure applied by police appear to have changed less. Compare, e. g.,
Miranda, supra, at 449 (" `[T]he principal psychological factor contributing
to a successful interrogation is privacy' ") (quoting F. Inbau & J. Reid,
Criminal Interrogation and Confessions 1 (1962)), with F. Inbau, J. Reid, &
J. Buckley, Criminal Interrogation and Confessions 24 (3d ed. 1986) ("The
principal psychological factor contributing to a successful interrogation
is privacy").

decisions to reinvoke them, on the theory that so long as theburden to demonstrate waiver rests on the government, it is

only fair to make the suspect shoulder a burden of showinga clear subsequent assertion. Miranda itself discredited the
legitimacy of any such distinction. The opinion describedthe object of the warning as being to assure "a continuous
opportunity to exercise [the right of silence]," 384 U. S., at444; see also

Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 458 (1986)(
Stevens, J., dissenting); accord, id., at 423, n. 1. "[C]on-tinuous opportunity" suggests an unvarying one, governed

by a common standard of effectiveness. The suggestion isconfirmed by the very first statement that follows, that
"there can be no questioning" if the suspect "indicates in anymanner and at any stage of the process that he wishes to
consult with an attorney," Miranda, 384 U. S., at 444-445."[A]t any stage" obviously includes the stage after initial
waiver and the commencement of questioning, and "indicatesin any manner" is a rule plainly in tension with the indication
"with a vengeance," see id., at 505 (Harlan, J., dissenting),that the Court would require for exercise of the "continuous"
right at some point after initial waiver.The Court defends as tolerable the certainty that some
poorly expressed requests for counsel will be disregarded onthe ground that

Miranda warnings suffice to alleviate the in-herent coercion of the custodial interrogation. Ante, at 460.

But, "[a] once-stated warning, delivered by those who will
conduct the interrogation, cannot itself suffice" to "assurethat the . . . right to choose between silence and speech remains unfettered throughout the interrogation process," 384U. S., at 469. Nor does the Court's defense reflect a sound
reading of the case it relies on, Moran v. Burbine, supra:

"Beyond [the] duty to inform, Miranda requires that the
police respect the [suspect's] decision to exercise therights outlined in the warnings. `If the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during ques512us2$83M 12-24-97 12:19:04 PAGES OPINPGT
472 DAVIS v. UNITED STATES

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
tioning, that he wishes to remain silent, [or if he] statesthat he wants an attorney, the interrogation must

cease.' " 475 U. S., at 420 (quoting Miranda, supra, at473-474).

While Moran held that a subject's knowing and voluntarywaiver of the right to counsel is not undermined by the fact
that police prevented an unsummoned lawyer from makingcontact with him, it contains no suggestion that Miranda
affords as ready a tolerance for police conduct frustrat-ing the suspect's subjectively held (if ambiguously expressed) desire for counsel. See 475 U. S., at 423 (contrast-ing

Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478, 481 (1964), where"police incorrectly told the suspect that his lawyer `didn't

want to see him' "); see also Miranda, supra, at 468 (purposeof warnings is to "show the individual that his interrogators are prepared to recognize his privilege should he chooseto exercise it").

Indeed, it is easy, amidst the discussion of layers of protec-tion, to lose sight of a real risk in the majority's approach,
going close to the core of what the Court has held that theFifth Amendment provides. The experience of the timid or
verbally inept suspect (whose existence the Court acknowl-edges) may not always closely follow that of the defendant
in Edwards v. Arizona (whose purported waiver of his rightto counsel, made after having invoked the right, was held
ineffective, lest police be tempted to "badge[r]" others likehim, see Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U. S. 344, 350 (1990)). Indeed, it may be more like that of the defendant in Escobedov. Illinois, supra, whose sense of dilemma was heightened
by his interrogators' denial of his requests to talk to a law-yer. When a suspect understands his (expressed) wishes to
have been ignored (and by hypothesis, he has said somethingthat an objective listener could "reasonably," although not
necessarily, take to be a request), in contravention of the"rights" just read to him by his interrogator, he may well

see further objection as futile and confession (true or not)as the only way to end his interrogation.

Nor is it enough to say that a " `statement either is . . . anassertion of the right to counsel or it is not.' " Ante, at 459

(quoting Smith v. Illinois, 469 U. S., at 97-98) (omittingbrackets and internal quotation marks). In

Smith, we nei-ther denied the possibility that a reference to counsel could

be ambiguous, see id., at 98; accord, id., at 101 (Rehnquist,
J., dissenting), nor suggested that particular statementsshould be considered in isolation,

id., at 98.6 While it mightbe fair to say that every statement is meant either to express

a desire to deal with police through counsel or not, this factdoes not dictate the rule that interrogators who hear a statement consistent with either possibility may presume thelatter and forge ahead; on the contrary, clarification is the
intuitively sensible course.The other justifications offered for the "requisite level of
clarity" rule, ante, at 459, are that, whatever its costs, it willfurther society's strong interest in "effective law enforcement," ante, at 461, and maintain the "ease of application,"

5 See People v. Harper, 94 Ill. App. 3d 298, 300, 418 N. E. 2d 894, 896
(1981) (defendant who asked interrogator to retrieve an attorney's business card from his wallet but was told that it " `wouldn't be necessary' "
held not to have "availed himself" of right to counsel); see also Cooper v.
Dupnik, 963 F. 2d 1220, 1225 (CA9 1992) (en banc) (describing elaborate
police Task Force plan to ignore systematically a suspect's requests for
counsel, on the theory that such would induce hopelessness and thereby
elicit an admission, which would then be used to keep the suspect off the
witness stand, see Oregon v. Hass, 420 U. S. 714 (1975) (statements
obtained in violation of Miranda rules admissible for impeachment
purposes)).

6 Indeed, our Smith decision was quoting from the dissent below, which

adverts in the same sentence to the possibility of "bona fide doubt the
officer may still have as to whether the defendant desires counsel," in
which case "strictly" limited questioning is prescribed. See People v.
Smith, 102 Ill. 2d 365, 375, 466 N. E. 2d 236, 241 (1984) (opinion of Simon,

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
ibid., that has long been a concern of our Miranda jurisprudence. With respect to the first point, the margin of difference between the clarification approach advocated here and
the one the Court adopts is defined by the class of cases in
which a suspect, if asked, would make it plain that he meant
to request counsel (at which point questioning would cease).
While these lost confessions do extract a real price from society, it is one that Miranda itself determined should be borne.
Cf. Brief for Americans for Effective Law Enforcement, Inc.,
et al. as Amici Curiae 5 (the clarification approach "preserves the interests of law enforcement and of the public
welfare"); Escobedo, supra, at 490 ("No system worth preserving should have to fear that if an accused is permitted
to consult with a lawyer, he will become aware of, and exercise, [his constitutional] rights").

As for practical application, while every approach, including the majority's, will involve some "difficult judgment
calls," 7 the rule argued for here would relieve the officer of

7 In the abstract, nothing may seem more clear than a "clear statement"
rule, but in police stations and trial courts the question, "how clear is
clear?" is not so readily answered. When a suspect says, "uh, yeah, I'd
like to do that" after being told he has a right to a lawyer, has he "clearly
asserted" his right? Compare Smith v. Illinois, 469 U. S., at 97 (statement was " `neither indecisive nor ambiguous' ") (citation omitted), with
id., at 101 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (questioning clarity); see also Oregon v. Bradshaw, 462 U. S. 1039, 1041-1042 (1983) (plurality opinion) ("I
do want an attorney before it goes very much further"); Edwards, 451
U. S., at 479 (" `I want an attorney before making a deal' "); cf. n. 3, supra.
Indeed, in this case, when Davis finally said, "I think I want a lawyer
before I say anything else," the agents ceased questioning; but see People
v. Kendricks, 121 Ill. App. 3d 442, 446, 459 N. E. 2d 1137, 1139 (1984)
(agents need not stop interrogation when suspect says, " `I think I might
need a lawyer' "); cf. People v. Santiago, 133 App. Div. 429, 430-431, 519
N. Y. S. 2d 413, 414-415 (1987) (" `Will you supply [a lawyer] now so that
I may ask him should I continue with this interview at this moment?' "
held "not . . . an unequivocal invocation"). See generally Smith, supra,
at 101 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (noting that statements are rarely
"crystal-clear"; "differences between certainty and hesitancy may well

any responsibility for guessing "whether the suspect in factwants a lawyer even though he hasn't said so," ante, at 461.

To the contrary, it would assure that the "judgment call" willbe made by the party most competent to resolve the ambiguity, who our case law has always assumed should make it:the individual suspect.

II
Although I am convinced that the Court has taken thewrong path, I am not persuaded by petitioner's contention

that even ambiguous statements require an end to all policequestioning. I recognize that the approach petitioner urges
on us can claim some support from our case law, most nota-bly in the "indicates in any manner" language of Miranda,
and I do not deny that the rule I endorse could be abusedby "clarifying" questions that shade subtly into illicitly badgering a suspect who wants counsel, but see Thompson v.
Wainwright, 601 F. 2d 768, 771-772 (CA5 1979); cf. State v.Walkowiak, 183 Wis. 2d 478, 515 N. W. 2d 863 (1994) (Abrahamson, J., concurring) (suggesting means properly to focusclarification enquiry). But petitioner's proposal is not entirely in harmony with all the major themes of Miranda caselaw, its virtues and demerits being the reverse images of
those that mark the Court's rule. While it is plainly wrong,for example, to continue interrogation when the suspect
wants it to stop (and so indicates), the strong bias in favorof individual choice may also be disserved by stopping questioning when a suspect wants it to continue (but where hisstatement might be understood otherwise), see

Michigan v.

turn on the inflection with which words are spoken, especially where [a]
statement is isolated from the statements surrounding it").

As a practical matter, of course, the primary arbiters of "clarity" will
be the interrogators themselves, who tend as well to be courts' preferred
source in determining the precise words a suspect used. And when an
inculpatory statement has been obtained as a result of an unrecorded,
incommunicado interrogation, these officers rarely lose "swearing
matches" against criminal defendants at suppression hearings.

confessions would, moreover, be especially hard to bearwhere the suspect, if asked for his choice, would have chosen
to continue. One need not sign the majority's opinion hereto agree that resort to the rule petitioner argues for should
be had only if experience shows that less drastic means ofsafeguarding suspects' constitutional rights are not up to the
job, see generally United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 927-928 (1984) (

* * *
Our cases are best respected by a rule that when a suspectunder custodial interrogation makes an ambiguous statement

that might reasonably be understood as expressing a wishthat a lawyer be summoned (and questioning cease), interrogators' questions should be confined to verifying whether theindividual meant to ask for a lawyer. While there is reason
to expect that trial courts will apply today's ruling sensibly(without requiring criminal suspects to speak with the discrimination of an Oxford don) and that interrogators willcontinue to follow what the Court rightly calls "good police
practice" (compelled up to now by a substantial body of stateand Circuit law), I believe that the case law under

Mirandadoes not allow them to do otherwise.

477OCTOBER TERM, 1993
Syllabus

HECK v. HUMPHREY et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 93-6188. Argued April 18, 1994--Decided June 24, 1994
While petitioner Heck's direct appeal from an Indiana conviction was

pending, he filed this suit under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, seeking damages--
but not injunctive relief or release from custody--on the claim that respondents, acting under color of state law, had engaged in unlawful acts
that had led to his arrest and conviction. After the Federal District
Court dismissed this action without prejudice, the Indiana Supreme
Court upheld Heck's conviction and sentence, and his two petitions for
federal habeas relief were rejected. The Court of Appeals then affirmed the dismissal of the $ 1983 complaint and approved the District
Court's reasoning: If the plaintiff in a federal civil rights action is challenging the legality of his conviction, so that his victory would require
his release even if he had not sought that relief, the suit must be classified as a habeas corpus action and dismissed if the plaintiff has failed to
exhaust his state remedies.

Held: In order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a $ 1983 plaintiff
must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct
appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a
federal court's issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U. S. C. $ 2254. A
claim for damages bearing that relationship to a conviction or sentence
that has not been so invalidated is not cognizable under $ 1983. Preiser
v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 494, and Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539,
554, distinguished. The foregoing conclusion follows upon recognition
that the common law of torts provides the appropriate starting point
for the $ 1983 inquiry, see Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 257-258; that
the tort of malicious prosecution, which provides the closest analogy to
claims of the type considered here, requires the allegation and proof of
termination of the prior criminal proceeding in favor of the accused, see,
e. g., Carpenter v. Nutter, 59 P. 301; and that this Court has long been
concerned that judgments be final and consistent and has been disinclined to expand opportunities for collateral attack on criminal convictions, see, e. g., Parke v. Raley, 506 U. S. 20, 29-30. Although the issue
in cases such as this is not, therefore, the exhaustion of state remedies,

1 naming as defendants respondents

James Humphrey and Robert Ewbank, Dearborn Countyprosecutors, and Michael Krinoph, an investigator with the

Indiana State Police. The complaint alleged that respondents, acting under color of state law, had engaged in an "un-lawful, unreasonable, and arbitrary investigation" leading to

petitioner's arrest; "knowingly destroyed" evidence "whichwas exculpatory in nature and could have proved [petitioner's] innocence"; and caused "an illegal and unlawfulvoice identification procedure" to be used at petitioner's trial.
App. 5-6. The complaint sought, among other things, com-pensatory and punitive monetary damages. It did not ask
for injunctive relief, and petitioner has not sought release
from custody in this action.The District Court dismissed the action without prejudice,

because the issues it raised "directly implicate the legality
of [petitioner's] confinement," id., at 13. While petitioner's
appeal to the Seventh Circuit was pending, the Indiana Supreme Court upheld his conviction and sentence on direct
appeal, Heck v. State, 552 N. E. 2d 446, 449 (Ind. 1990); his
first petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District
Court was dismissed because it contained unexhausted
claims; and his second federal habeas petition was denied,
and the denial affirmed by the Seventh Circuit.

dismissal of his $ 1983 complaint, it affirmed the judgment

rights action] is challenging the legality of his conviction,[2]so that if he won his case the state would be obliged to release him even if he hadn't sought that relief, the suit is classified as an application for habeas corpus and the plaintiff
must exhaust his state remedies, on pain of dismissal if he
fails to do so." 997 F. 2d 355, 357 (1993). Heck filed a petition for certiorari, which we granted. 510 U. S. 1068 (1994).

II
This case lies at the intersection of the two most fertile
sources of federal-court prisoner litigation--the Civil Rights
Act of 1871, Rev. Stat. $ 1979, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983,
and the federal habeas corpus statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 2254.
Both of these provide access to a federal forum for claims of
unconstitutional treatment at the hands of state officials, but
they differ in their scope and operation. In general, exhaustion of state remedies "is not a prerequisite to an action
under $ 1983," Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457 U. S.
496, 501 (1982) (emphasis added), even an action by a state
prisoner, id., at 509. The federal habeas corpus statute, by

2 Neither in his petition for certiorari nor in his principal brief on the
merits did petitioner contest the description of his monetary claims (by
both the District Court and the Court of Appeals) as challenging the legality of his conviction. Thus, the question we understood to be before us
was whether money damages premised on an unlawful conviction could be
pursued under $ 1983. Petitioner sought to challenge this premise in his
reply brief, contending that findings validating his damages claims would
not invalidate his conviction. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 5-6. That
argument comes too late. We did not take this case to review such a
fact-bound issue, and we accept the characterization of the lower courts.

We also decline to pursue, without implying the nonexistence of, another
issue, suggested by the Court of Appeals' statement that, if petitioner's
"conviction were proper, this suit would in all likelihood be barred by
res judicata." 997 F. 2d 355, 357 (CA7 1993). The res judicata effect of
state-court decisions in $ 1983 actions is a matter of state law. See Migra
v. Warren City School Dist. Bd. of Ed., 465 U. S. 75 (1984).

contrast, requires that state prisoners first seek redress in astate forum.

3 See Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509 (1982).

Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475 (1973), considered thepotential overlap between these two provisions, and held

that habeas corpus is the exclusive remedy for a state prisoner who challenges the fact or duration of his confinement
and seeks immediate or speedier release, even though such
a claim may come within the literal terms of $ 1983. Id.,
at 488-490. We emphasize that Preiser did not create an
exception to the "no exhaustion" rule of $ 1983; it merely
held that certain claims by state prisoners are not cognizable
under that provision, and must be brought in habeas corpus
proceedings, which do contain an exhaustion requirement.

This case is clearly not covered by the holding of Preiser,
for petitioner seeks not immediate or speedier release, but
monetary damages, as to which he could not "have sought
and obtained fully effective relief through federal habeas corpus proceedings." Id., at 488. See also id., at 494; Allen
v. McCurry, 449 U. S. 90, 104 (1980). In dictum, however,

Preiser asserted that since a state prisoner seeking only
damages "is attacking something other than the fact or
length of . . . confinement, and . . . is seeking something other
than immediate or more speedy release[,] . . . a damages action by a state prisoner could be brought under [$ 1983] in
federal court without any requirement of prior exhaustion of
state remedies." 411 U. S., at 494. That statement may
not be true, however, when establishing the basis for the
damages claim necessarily demonstrates the invalidity of the

3 Title 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b) provides: "An application for a writ of habeas
corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a
State court shall not be granted unless it appears that the applicant has
exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State, or that there
is either an absence of available State corrective process or the existence
of circumstances rendering such process ineffective to protect the rights
of the prisoner."

Opinion of the Court
conviction. In that situation, the claimant can be said to be"attacking . . . the fact or length of . . . confinement," bringing the suit within the other dictum of Preiser: "Congresshas determined that habeas corpus is the appropriate remedy for state prisoners attacking the validity of the fact or
length of their confinement, and that specific determinationmust override the general terms of $ 1983."

Id., at 490. In
the last analysis, we think the dicta of Preiser to be an un-reliable, if not an unintelligible, guide: that opinion had no

cause to address, and did not carefully consider, the damagesquestion before us today.

Before addressing that question, we respond to petitioner's contention that it has already been answered, in Wolff
v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539 (1974). See Reply Brief for
Petitioner 1. First of all, if Wolff had answered the question we would not have expressly reserved it 10 years later,
as we did in Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S. 914 (1984). See id.,
at 923. And secondly, a careful reading of Wolff itself does
not support the contention. Like Preiser, Wolff involved
a challenge to the procedures used by state prison officials
to deprive prisoners of good-time credits. The $ 1983 complaint sought restoration of good-time credits as well as
"damages for the deprivation of civil rights resulting from
the use of the allegedly unconstitutional procedures."
Wolff, supra, at 553. The Court said, after holding the claim
for good-time credits to be foreclosed by Preiser, that the
damages claim was nonetheless "properly before the District
Court and required determination of the validity of the procedures employed for imposing sanctions, including loss of
good time," 418 U. S., at 554. Petitioner contends that this
language authorized the plaintiffs in Wolff to recover damages measured by the actual loss of good time. We think
not. In light of the earlier language characterizing the
claim as one of "damages for the deprivation of civil rights,"
rather than damages for the deprivation of good-time credits,
we think this passage recognized a $ 1983 claim for using the

483Cite as: 512 U. S. 477 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
wrong procedures, not for reaching the wrong result (i. e.,denying good-time credits). Nor is there any indication in

the opinion, or any reason to believe, that using the wrongprocedures necessarily vitiated the denial of good-time credits. Thus, the claim at issue in Wolff did not call into question the lawfulness of the plaintiff 's continuing confinement.See

Fulford v. Klein, 529 F. 2d 377, 381 (1976), adhered to,
550 F. 2d 342 (CA5 1977) (en banc); Schwartz, The PreiserPuzzle: Continued Frustrating Conflict Between the Civil

Rights and Habeas Corpus Remedies for State Prisoners, 37DePaul L. Rev. 85, 120-121, 145-146 (1988).

Thus, the question posed by $ 1983 damages claims that do
call into question the lawfulness of conviction or confinement
remains open. To answer that question correctly, we see no
need to abandon, as the Seventh Circuit and those courts in
agreement with it have done, our teaching that $ 1983 contains no exhaustion requirement beyond what Congress has
provided. Patsy, 457 U. S., at 501, 509. The issue with respect to monetary damages challenging conviction is not, it
seems to us, exhaustion; but rather, the same as the issue
was with respect to injunctive relief challenging conviction
in Preiser: whether the claim is cognizable under $ 1983 at
all. We conclude that it is not.

"We have repeatedly noted that 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 creates
a species of tort liability." Memphis Community School
Dist. v. Stachura, 477 U. S. 299, 305 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). "[O]ver the centuries the common law
of torts has developed a set of rules to implement the principle that a person should be compensated fairly for injuries
caused by the violation of his legal rights. These rules, defining the elements of damages and the prerequisites for
their recovery, provide the appropriate starting point for the
inquiry under $ 1983 as well." Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S.
247, 257-258 (1978). Thus, to determine whether there is
any bar to the present suit, we look first to the common law
of torts. Cf. Stachura, supra, at 306.

484 HECK v. HUMPHREY

Opinion of the Court
The common-law cause of action for malicious prosecution
provides the closest analogy to claims of the type considered
here because, unlike the related cause of action for false
arrest or imprisonment, it permits damages for confinement
imposed pursuant to legal process. "If there is a false arrest
claim, damages for that claim cover the time of detention
up until issuance of process or arraignment, but not more."
W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and
Keeton on Law of Torts 888 (5th ed. 1984). But a successful
malicious prosecution plaintiff may recover, in addition to
general damages, "compensation for any arrest or imprisonment, including damages for discomfort or injury to his
health, or loss of time and deprivation of the society." Id.,
at 887-888 (footnotes omitted). See also Roberts v. Thomas,
135 Ky. 63, 121 S. W. 961 (1909).

One element that must be alleged and proved in a malicious prosecution action is termination of the prior criminal
proceeding in favor of the accused. Prosser and Keeton,
supra, at 874; Carpenter v. Nutter, 127 Cal. 61, 59 P. 301
(1899). This requirement "avoids parallel litigation over
the issues of probable cause and guilt . . . and it precludes
the possibility of the claimant [sic] succeeding in the tort
action after having been convicted in the underlying criminal prosecution, in contravention of a strong judicial policy
against the creation of two conflicting resolutions arising
out of the same or identical transaction." 8 S. Speiser,
C. Krause, & A. Gans, American Law of Torts $ 28:5, p. 24
(1991). Furthermore, "to permit a convicted criminal defendant to proceed with a malicious prosecution claim would
permit a collateral attack on the conviction through the vehicle of a civil suit." Ibid.4 This Court has long expressed

4 Justice Souter criticizes our reliance on malicious prosecution's favorable termination requirement as illustrative of the common-law principle barring tort plaintiffs from mounting collateral attacks on their out512us2$84K 01-08-98 12:35:21 PAGES OPINPGT

similar concerns for finality and consistency and has gener-ally declined to expand opportunities for collateral attack,

see Parke v. Raley, 506 U. S. 20, 29-30 (1992); Teague v.Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 308 (1989); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co.,

standing criminal convictions. Malicious prosecution is an inapt analogy,
he says, because "[a] defendant's conviction, under Reconstruction-era
common law, dissolved his claim for malicious prosecution because the conviction was regarded as irrebuttable evidence that the prosecution never
lacked probable cause." Post, at 496, citing T. Cooley, Law of Torts 185
(1879). Chief Justice Cooley no doubt intended merely to set forth the
general rule that a conviction defeated the malicious prosecution plaintiff's
allegation (essential to his cause of action) that the prior proceeding was
without probable cause. But this was not an absolute rule in all jurisdictions, see Goodrich v. Warner, 21 Conn. 432, 443 (1852); Richter v. Koster,
45 Ind. 440, 441-442 (1874), and early on it was recognized that there must
be exceptions to the rule in cases involving circumstances such as fraud,
perjury, or mistake of law, see Burt v. Place, 4 Wend. 591 (N. Y. 1830);
Witham v. Gowen, 14 Me. 362 (1837); Olson v. Neal, 63 Iowa 214, 18 N. W.
863 (1884). Some cases even held that a "conviction, although it be afterwards reversed, is prima facie evidence--and that only--of the existence
of probable cause." Neher v. Dobbs, 41 Neb. 863, 868, 66 N. W. 864, 865
(1896) (collecting cases). In Crescent City Live Stock Co. v. Butchers'
Union Slaughter-House Co., 120 U. S. 141 (1887), we recognized that
"[h]ow much weight as proof of probable cause shall be attributed to the
judgment of the court in the original action, when subsequently reversed
for error, may admit of some question." Id., at 149. We attempted to
"reconcile the apparent contradiction in the authorities," id., at 151, by
observing that the presumption of probable cause arising from a conviction
can be rebutted only by showing that the conviction had been obtained by
some type of fraud, ibid. Although we ultimately held for the malicious
prosecution defendant, our discussion in that case well establishes that the
absolute rule Justice Souter contends for did not exist.

Yet even if Justice Souter were correct in asserting that a prior conviction, although reversed, "dissolved [a] claim for malicious prosecution,"
post, at 496, our analysis would be unaffected. It would simply demonstrate that no common-law action, not even malicious prosecution, would
permit a criminal proceeding to be impugned in a tort action, even after
the conviction had been reversed. That would, if anything, strengthen
our belief that $ 1983, which borrowed general tort principles, was not
meant to permit such collateral attack.

Opinion of the Court
263 U. S. 413 (1923); Voorhees v. Jackson, 10 Pet. 449, 472-473 (1836). We think the hoary principle that civil tort actions are not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validityof outstanding criminal judgments applies to $ 1983 damages
actions that necessarily require the plaintiff to prove the un-lawfulness of his conviction or confinement, just as it has
always applied to actions for malicious prosecution.5We hold that, in order to recover damages for allegedly
unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for otherharm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a
conviction or sentence invalid,6 a $ 1983 plaintiff must prove

5 Justice Souter's discussion of abuse of process, post, at 494-495, does
not undermine this principle. It is true that favorable termination of
prior proceedings is not an element of that cause of action--but neither is
an impugning of those proceedings one of its consequences. The gravamen of that tort is not the wrongfulness of the prosecution, but some
extortionate perversion of lawfully initiated process to illegitimate ends.
See, e. g., Donohoe Const. Co. v. Mount Vernon Associates, 235 Va. 531,
539-540, 369 S. E. 2d 857, 862 (1988); see also 8 S. Speiser, C. Krause, &
A. Gans, American Law of Torts $$ 28:32-28:34 (1991). Cognizable injury
for abuse of process is limited to the harm caused by the misuse of process,
and does not include harm (such as conviction and confinement) resulting
from that process's being carried through to its lawful conclusion. Thus,
one could no more seek compensatory damages for an outstanding criminal
conviction in an action for abuse of process than in one for malicious prosecution. This limitation is illustrated by McGann v. Allen, 105 Conn. 177,
191, 134 A. 810, 815 (1926), where the court held that expenses incurred
by the plaintiff in defending herself against crimes charged against her
were not compensable in a suit for abuse of process, since "[d]amage[s] for
abuse of process must be confined to the damage flowing from such abuse,
and be confined to the period of time involved in taking plaintiff, after her
arrest, to [defendant's] store, and the detention there."

6 An example of this latter category--a $ 1983 action that does not seek

damages directly attributable to conviction or confinement but whose successful prosecution would necessarily imply that the plaintiff's criminal
conviction was wrongful--would be the following: A state defendant is
convicted of and sentenced for the crime of resisting arrest, defined as
intentionally preventing a peace officer from effecting a lawful arrest.
(This is a common definition of that offense. See People v. Peacock, 68
N. Y. 2d 675, 496 N. E. 2d 683 (1986); 4 C. Torcia, Wharton's Criminal Law

$ 593, p. 307 (14th ed. 1981).) He then brings a $ 1983 action against the

Opinion of the Court
that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on directappeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a

state tribunal authorized to make such determination, orcalled into question by a federal court's issuance of a writ of
habeas corpus, 28 U. S. C. $ 2254. A claim for damages bear-ing that relationship to a conviction or sentence that has

notbeen so invalidated is not cognizable under $ 1983. Thus,

when a state prisoner seeks damages in a $ 1983 suit, thedistrict court must consider whether a judgment in favor
of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of hisconviction or sentence; if it would, the complaint must be
dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the con-viction or sentence has already been invalidated. But if the
district court determines that the plaintiff 's action, even ifsuccessful, will

not demonstrate the invalidity of any out-standing criminal judgment against the plaintiff, the action

should be allowed to proceed,7 in the absence of some otherbar to the suit.

arresting officer, seeking damages for violation of his Fourth Amendment
right to be free from unreasonable seizures. In order to prevail in this

$ 1983 action, he would have to negate an element of the offense of which
he has been convicted. Regardless of the state law concerning res judicata, see n. 2, supra, the $ 1983 action will not lie.

7 For example, a suit for damages attributable to an allegedly unreasonable search may lie even if the challenged search produced evidence
that was introduced in a state criminal trial resulting in the $ 1983 plaintiff's still-outstanding conviction. Because of doctrines like independent
source and inevitable discovery, see Murray v. United States, 487 U. S.
533, 539 (1988), and especially harmless error, see Arizona v. Fulminante,
499 U. S. 279, 307-308 (1991), such a $ 1983 action, even if successful, would
not necessarily imply that the plaintiff's conviction was unlawful. In
order to recover compensatory damages, however, the $ 1983 plaintiff must
prove not only that the search was unlawful, but that it caused him actual,
compensable injury, see Memphis Community School Dist. v. Stachura,
477 U. S. 299, 308 (1986), which, we hold today, does not encompass the
"injury" of being convicted and imprisoned (until his conviction has been
overturned).

8 For example, if a state criminal defendant brings a federal civil-rights

lawsuit during the pendency of his criminal trial, appeal, or state habeas action, abstention may be an appropriate response to the parallel

488 HECK v. HUMPHREY

Opinion of the Court
Respondents had urged us to adopt a rule that was in onerespect broader than this: Exhaustion of state remedies

should be required, they contended, not just when successin the $ 1983 damages suit would necessarily show a conviction or sentence to be unlawful, but whenever "judgment ina $ 1983 action would resolve a necessary element to a likely
challenge to a conviction, even if the $ 1983 court [need] notdetermine that the conviction is invalid." Brief for Respondents 26, n. 10. Such a broad sweep was needed, re-spondents contended, lest a judgment in a prisoner's favor
in a federal-court $ 1983 damages action claiming, for exam-ple, a Fourth Amendment violation, be given preclusive
effect as to that subissue in a subsequent state-court post-conviction proceeding. Preclusion might result, they asserted, if the State exercised sufficient control over the offi-cials' defense in the $ 1983 action. See Montana v. United
States, 440 U. S. 147, 154 (1979). While we have no occasionto rule on the matter at this time, it is at least plain that
preclusion will not necessarily be an automatic, or even apermissible, effect.

state-court proceedings. See Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.
v. United States, 424 U. S. 800 (1976).

Moreover, we do not decide whether abstention might be appropriate in
cases where a state prisoner brings a $ 1983 damages suit raising an issue
that also could be grounds for relief in a state-court challenge to his conviction or sentence. Cf. Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S. 914, 923 (1984).

9 State courts are bound to apply federal rules in determining the preclusive effect of federal-court decisions on issues of federal law. See
P. Bator, D. Meltzer, P. Mishkin, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The
Federal Courts and the Federal System 1604 (3d ed. 1988) ("It is clear
that where the federal court decided a federal question, federal res judicata rules govern"); Deposit Bank v. Frankfort, 191 U. S. 499, 514-518
(1903); Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U. S. 165, 170-171, 174-175 (1938). The federal rules on the subject of issue and claim preclusion, unlike those relating
to exhaustion of state remedies, are "almost entirely judge-made."
Hart & Wechsler's, supra, at 1598; see also Burbank, Interjurisdictional
Preclusion, Full Faith and Credit and Federal Common Law: A General
Approach, 71 Cornell L. Rev. 733, 747-778 (1986). And in developing

489Cite as: 512 U. S. 477 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
In another respect, however, our holding sweeps morebroadly than the approach respondents had urged. We do

not engraft an exhaustion requirement upon $ 1983, butrather deny the existence of a cause of action. Even a prisoner who has fully exhausted available state remedies hasno cause of action under $ 1983 unless and until the conviction or sentence is reversed, expunged, invalidated, or im-pugned by the grant of a writ of habeas corpus. That makes
it unnecessary for us to address the statute-of-limitationsissue wrestled with by the Court of Appeals, which concluded that a federal doctrine of equitable tolling wouldapply to the $ 1983 cause of action while state challenges to
the conviction or sentence were being exhausted. (Thecourt distinguished our cases holding that state, not federal,
tolling provisions apply in $ 1983 actions, see Board of Re-gents of Univ. of State of N. Y. v. Tomanio, 446 U. S. 478
(1980); Hardin v. Straub, 490 U. S. 536 (1989), on the groundthat petitioner's claim was "in part one for habeas corpus."
997 F. 2d, at 358.) Under our analysis the statute of limita-tions poses no difficulty while the state challenges are being
pursued, since the $ 1983 claim has not yet arisen. Just asa cause of action for malicious prosecution does not accrue
until the criminal proceedings have terminated in the plain-tiff 's favor, 1 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions $ 7.4.1, p. 532
(1991); Carnes v. Atkins Bros. Co., 123 La. 26, 31, 48 So. 572,574 (1909), so also a $ 1983 cause of action for damages

them the courts can, and indeed should, be guided by the federal policies
reflected in congressional enactments. Cf. Moragne v. States Marine
Lines, Inc., 398 U. S. 375, 390-391 (1970). See also United States v. Mendoza, 464 U. S. 154 (1984) (recognizing exception to general principles of
res judicata in light of overriding federal policy concerns). Thus, the
court-made preclusion rules may, as judicial application of the categorical
mandate of $ 1983 may not, see Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457
U. S. 496, 509 (1982), take account of the policy embodied in $ 2254(b)'s
exhaustion requirement, see Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509 (1982), that state
courts be given the first opportunity to review constitutional claims bearing upon state prisoners' release from custody.

attributable to an unconstitutional conviction or sentencedoes not accrue until the conviction or sentence has been

invalidated.10Applying these principles to the present action, in which
both courts below found that the damages claims challengedthe legality of the conviction, we find that the dismissal of
the action was correct. The judgment of the Court of Ap-peals for the Seventh Circuit is

Affirmed.
Justice Thomas, concurring.
The Court and Justice Souter correctly begin their anal-yses with the realization that "[t]his case lies at the intersection of . . . the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Rev. Stat. $ 1979, asamended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, and the federal habeas corpus
statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 2254." Ante, at 480; post, at 491. Oneneed only read the respective opinions in this case to under10 Justice Souter also adopts the common-law principle that one cannot use the device of a civil tort action to challenge the validity of an
outstanding criminal conviction, but thinks it necessary to abandon that
principle in those cases (of which no real-life example comes to mind) involving former state prisoners who, because they are no longer in custody,
cannot bring postconviction challenges. Post, at 500. We think the principle barring collateral attacks--a longstanding and deeply rooted feature
of both the common law and our own jurisprudence--is not rendered inapplicable by the fortuity that a convicted criminal is no longer incarcerated. Justice Souter opines that disallowing a damages suit for a former state prisoner framed by Ku Klux Klan-dominated state officials is
"hard indeed to reconcile . . . with the purpose of $ 1983." Post, at 502.
But if, as Justice Souter appears to suggest, the goal of our interpretive enterprise under $ 1983 were to provide a remedy for all conceivable invasions of federal rights that freedmen may have suffered at the
hands of officials of the former States of the Confederacy, the entire landscape of our $ 1983 jurisprudence would look very different. We would
not, for example, have adopted the rule that judicial officers have absolute
immunity from liability for damages under $ 1983, Pierson v. Ray, 386
U. S. 547 (1967), a rule that would prevent recovery by a former slave who
had been tried and convicted before a corrupt state judge in league with
the Ku Klux Klan.

stand the difficulty of the task before the Court today. Boththe Court and

Justice Souter embark on a similar enterprise--harmonizing "[t]he broad language of $ 1983," a "gen-eral" statute, with "the specific federal habeas corpus statute." Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 489 (1973).

I write separately to note that it is we who have put $ 1983and the habeas statute on what

Justice Souter appropriately terms a "collision course." Post, at 492. It haslong been recognized that we have expanded the prerogative

writ of habeas corpus and $ 1983 far beyond the limited scopeeither was originally intended to have. Cf.,

e. g., Wright
v. West, 505 U. S. 277, 285-286 (1992) (opinion of Thomas,
J.) (habeas); Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493
U. S. 103, 117 (1989) (Kennedy, J., dissenting) ($ 1983). Expanding the two historic statutes brought them squarely into
conflict in the context of suits by state prisoners, as we made
clear in Preiser.

Given that the Court created the tension between the two
statutes, it is proper for the Court to devise limitations
aimed at ameliorating the conflict, provided that it does
so in a principled fashion. Cf. Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S.
335, 342 (1986). Because the Court today limits the scope of

$ 1983 in a manner consistent both with the federalism concerns undergirding the explicit exhaustion requirement of
the habeas statute, ante, at 483, and with the state of the
common law at the time $ 1983 was enacted, ante, at 484-486,
and n. 4, I join the Court's opinion.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Blackmun, Justice Stevens, and Justice O'Connor join, concurring in
the judgment.

The Court begins its analysis as I would, by observing
that "[t]his case lies at the intersection of the two most fertile sources of federal-court prisoner litigation--the Civil
Rights Act of 1871, . . . 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, and the federal
habeas corpus statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 2254," two statutes that

492 HECK v. HUMPHREY

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
"provide access to a federal forum for claims of unconstitutional treatment at the hands of state officials," while "differ[ing] in their scope and operation." Ante, at 480. But instead of analyzing the statutes to determine which should
yield to the other at this intersection, the Court appears to
take the position that the statutes were never on a collision
course in the first place because, like the common-law tort of
malicious prosecution, $ 1983 requires (and, presumably, has
always required) plaintiffs seeking damages for unconstitutional conviction or confinement to show the favorable termination of the underlying proceeding. See ante, at 484-487.

While I do not object to referring to the common law when
resolving the question this case presents, I do not think that
the existence of the tort of malicious prosecution alone
provides the answer. Common-law tort rules can provide
a "starting point for the inquiry under $ 1983," Carey v.
Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 258 (1978), but we have relied on the
common law in $ 1983 cases only when doing so was thought
to be consistent with ordinary rules of statutory construction, as when common-law principles have textual support in
other provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, see, e. g., id.,
at 255-256 (damages under $ 1983), or when those principles
were so fundamental and widely understood at the time

$ 1983 was enacted that the 42d Congress could not be presumed to have abrogated them silently, see, e. g., Tenney v.
Brandhove, 341 U. S. 367, 376 (1951) (immunity under $ 1983);
Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 553-554 (1967) (same). At the
same time, we have consistently refused to allow commonlaw analogies to displace statutory analysis, declining to import even well-settled common-law rules into $ 1983 "if [the
statute's] history or purpose counsel against applying [such
rules] in $ 1983 actions." Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S. 158, 164

An examination of common-law sources arguably relevantin this case confirms the soundness of our hierarchy of principles for resolving questions concerning $ 1983. If the common law were not merely a "starting point" for the analysisunder $ 1983, but its destination, then (unless we were to

have some authority to choose common-law requirements welike and discard the others) principle would compel us to accept as elements of the $ 1983 cause of action not only themalicious-prosecution tort's favorable-termination requirement, but other elements of the tort that cannot coherentlybe transplanted. In addition to proving favorable termina1 Our recent opinion in Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S. 158 (1992), summarized
the manner in which the Court has analyzed the relationship between the
common law and $ 1983 in the context of immunity:

"Section 1983 `creates a species of tort liability that on its face admits
of no immunities.' Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 417 (1976). Nonetheless, we have accorded certain government officials either absolute or
qualified immunity from suit if the `tradition of immunity was so firmly
rooted in the common law and was supported by such strong policy reasons that "Congress would have specifically so provided had it wished to
abolish the doctrine." ' Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U. S. 622, 637
(1980) (quoting Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 555 (1967)). If parties seeking immunity were shielded from tort liability when Congress enacted the
Civil Rights Act of 1871--$ 1 of which is codified at 42 U. S. C. $ 1983--we
infer from legislative silence that Congress did not intend to abrogate such
immunities when it imposed liability for actions taken under color of state
law. See Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S. 914, 920 (1984); Imbler, supra, at 421;
Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U. S. 522, 529 (1984). Additionally, irrespective of
the common law support, we will not recognize an immunity available at
common law if $ 1983's history or purpose counsel against applying it
in $ 1983 actions. Tower, supra, at 920. See also Imbler, supra, at 424-
429." Id., at 163-164.

In his concurrence, Justice Kennedy stated: "It must be remembered
that unlike the common-law judges whose doctrines we adopt, we are devising limitations to a remedial statute, enacted by the Congress, which
`on its face does not provide for any immunities.' " Id., at 171 (quoting
Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 342 (1986)) (emphasis added in Malley).

tion, a plaintiff in a malicious-prosecution action, accordingto the same sources the Court relies upon, must prove the

"[a]bsence of probable cause for the proceeding" as well as" `[m]alice,' or a primary purpose other than that of bringing
an offender to justice." W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &
D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 871 (5th ed.1984) (hereinafter Prosser and Keeton); see also 8 S. Speiser,

C. Krause, & A. Gans, American Law of Torts $ 28:7, p. 38,$ 28:11, p. 61 (1991). As $ 1983 requirements, however, these
elements would mean that even a $ 1983 plaintiff whoseconviction was invalidated as unconstitutional (premised, for
example, on a confession coerced by an interrogation-room
beating) could not obtain damages for the unconstitutional
conviction and ensuing confinement if the defendant police
officials (or perhaps the prosecutor) had probable cause to
believe the plaintiff was guilty and intended to bring him
to justice. Absent an independent statutory basis for doing
so, importing into $ 1983 the malicious-prosecution tort's
favorable-termination requirement but not its probablecause requirement would be particularly odd since it is from
the latter that the former derives. See Prosser and Keeton
874 ("The requirement that the criminal prosecution terminate in favor of the malicious prosecution plaintiff . . . is
primarily important not as an independent element of the
malicious prosecution action but only for what it shows about
probable cause or guilt-in-fact"); M. Bigelow, Leading Cases
on Law of Torts 196 (1875) ("The action for a malicious prosecution cannot be maintained until the prosecution has terminated; for otherwise the plaintiff might obtain judgment
in the one case and yet be convicted in the other, which
would of course disprove the averment of a want of probable cause").

If, in addition, the common law were the master of statutory analysis, not the servant (to switch metaphors), we
would find ourselves with two masters to contend with here,
for we would be subject not only to the tort of malicious

prosecution but to the tort of abuse of process as well, see
Wyatt v. Cole, supra, at 164 (calling these two actions "the
most closely analogous torts" to $ 1983), the latter makingit "unnecessary for the plaintiff to prove that the proceeding has terminated in his favor," Prosser and Keeton 897.
The Court suggests that the tort of malicious prosecutionprovides "the closest analogy to claims of the type considered here" because "it permits damages for confinement im-posed pursuant to legal process."

Ante, at 484. But the
same appears to be true for the tort of abuse of process. SeeRestatement (Second) of Torts $ 682, Illustration 1 (1977)

(indicating that a person who, by causing a court to issue a writof capias against someone to whom he lent money, caused the
borrower to be "arrested . . . and kept in prison" is properly
held liable for the arrest and imprisonment if the lender'spurpose in using legal process was wrongful (and regardless

of favorable termination or want of probable cause)).2

Furthermore, even if the tort of malicious prosecution
were today marginally more analogous than other torts to
the type of $ 1983 claim in the class of cases before us (because it alone may permit damages for unlawful conviction
or postconviction confinement, see n. 3, infra), the Court
overlooks a significant historical incongruity that calls into
question the utility of the analogy to the tort of malicious

2 As the Court observes, there are differences between the tort of abuse
of process and that of malicious prosecution. Ante, at 486, n. 5. While
"the gist of the tort [of malicious prosecution] is . . . . commencing an
action or causing process to issue without justification," abuse of process
involves "misusing, or misapplying process justified in itself for an end
other than that which it was designed to accomplish." Prosser and Keeton 897. Neither common-law tort, however, precisely matches the statutory $ 1983 claim for damages for unlawful conviction or confinement; and,
depending on the nature of the underlying right alleged to have been
violated (consider, for example, the right not to be selected for prosecution
solely because of one's race), the tort of abuse of process might provide a
better analogy to a $ 1983 claim for unconstitutional conviction or confinement than the malicious-prosecution tort.

prosecution insofar as it is used exclusively to determine thescope of $ 1983: the damages sought in the type of $ 1983

claim involved here, damages for unlawful conviction or post-conviction confinement, were not available at all in an action
for malicious prosecution at the time of $ 1983's enactment.A defendant's conviction, under Reconstruction-era common
law, dissolved his claim for malicious prosecution because theconviction was regarded as irrebuttable evidence that the
prosecution never lacked probable cause. See T. Cooley,Law of Torts 185 (1879) ("If the defendant is convicted in the
first instance and appeals, and is acquitted in the appellate
court, the conviction below is conclusive of probable cause").
Thus the definition of "favorable termination" with which theframers of $ 1983 were aware (if they were aware of any

definition) included none of the events relevant to the typeof $ 1983 claim involved in this case ("revers[al] on direct
appeal, expunge[ment] by executive order, [a] declar[ation][of] invalid[ity] by a state tribunal authorized to make such
determination, or [the] call[ing] into question by a federalcourt's issuance of a writ of habeas corpus,"

ante, at 487),
and it is easy to see why the analogy to the tort of malicious
prosecution in this context has escaped the collective wisdomof the many courts and commentators to have addressed the

issue previously, as well as the parties to this case. Indeed,relying on the tort of malicious prosecution to dictate the
outcome of this case would logically drive one to the position,untenable as a matter of statutory interpretation (and, to be
clear, disclaimed by the Court), that conviction of a crimewipes out a person's $ 1983 claim for damages for unconstitutional conviction or postconviction confinement.3

3 Some of the traditional common-law requirements appear to have liberalized over the years, see Prosser and Keeton 882 ("There is a considerable minority view which regards the conviction as creating only a presumption, which may be rebutted by any competent evidence showing that
probable cause for the prosecution did not in fact exist"), strengthening
the analogy the Court draws. But surely the Court is not of the view

We are not, however, in any such strait, for our enquiryin this case may follow the interpretive methodology employed in Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475 (1973) (a meth-odology uniformly applied by the Courts of Appeals in analyzing analogous cases, see, e. g., Young v. Kenny, 907 F. 2d874, 875-876 (CA9 1990)). In

Preiser, we read the "general"$ 1983 statute in light of the "specific federal habeas corpus

statute," which applies only to "person[s] in custody," 28U. S. C. $ 2254(a), and the habeas statute's policy, embodied
in its exhaustion requirement, $ 2254(b), that state courts begiven the first opportunity to review constitutional claims
bearing upon a state prisoner's release from custody. 411U. S., at 489. Though in contrast to

Preiser the state pris-oner here seeks damages, not release from custody, the distinction makes no difference when the damages sought arefor unconstitutional conviction or confinement. (As the
Court explains, nothing in Preiser nor in Wolff v. McDon-nell, 418 U. S. 539 (1974), is properly read as holding that the
relief sought in a $ 1983 action dictates whether a state pris-oner can proceed immediately to federal court. See

ante,

that a single tort in its late 20th-century form can conclusively (and retroactively) dictate the requirements of a 19th-century statute for a discrete
category of cases. Defending the historical analogy, the Court suggests
that Chief Justice Cooley did not mean what he clearly said and that,
despite the Cooley treatise, the Reconstruction-era common law recognized a limited exception to the rule denying a malicious-prosecution
plaintiff the benefit of the invalidation of his conviction: an exception for
convictions "obtained by some type of fraud." Ante, at 485, n. 4 (citing
Crescent City Live Stock Co. v. Butchers' Union Slaughter-House Co., 120
U. S. 141, 151 (1887)). Even if such a narrow exception existed, however,
the tort of malicious prosecution as it stood during the mid-19th century
would still make for a weak analogy to a statutory action under which, as
even the Court accepts, defendants whose convictions were reversed as
violating "any righ[t] . . . secured by the Constitution," 42 U. S. C. $ 1983,
may obtain damages for the unlawful confinement associated with the conviction (assuming, of course, no immunity bar). Nor, of course, would the
existence of such an exception explain how one element of a maliciousprosecution action may be imported into $ 1983, but not the others.

at 481-483.) Whether or not a federal-court $ 1983 damagesjudgment against state officials in such an action would have

preclusive effect in later litigation against the State, mount-ing damages against the defendant-officials for unlawful confinement (damages almost certainly to be paid by state indemnification) would, practically, compel the State to releasethe prisoner. Because allowing a state prisoner to proceed

directly with a federal-court $ 1983 attack on his convictionor sentence "would wholly frustrate explicit congressional
intent" as declared in the habeas exhaustion requirement,
Preiser, 411 U. S., at 489, the statutory scheme must be read
as precluding such attacks. This conclusion flows not from
a preference about how the habeas and $ 1983 statutes ought
to have been written, but from a recognition that "Congress
has determined that habeas corpus is the appropriate remedy for state prisoners attacking the validity of the fact or
length of their confinement, [a] specific determination [that]
must override the general terms of $ 1983." Id., at 490.

That leaves the question of how to implement what statutory analysis requires. It is at this point that the maliciousprosecution tort's favorable-termination requirement becomes helpful, not in dictating the elements of a $ 1983 cause
of action, but in suggesting a relatively simple way to avoid
collisions at the intersection of habeas and $ 1983. A state
prisoner may seek federal-court $ 1983 damages for unconstitutional conviction or confinement, but only if he has previously established the unlawfulness of his conviction or confinement, as on appeal or on habeas. This has the effect of
requiring a state prisoner challenging the lawfulness of his
confinement to follow habeas's rules before seeking $ 1983
damages for unlawful confinement in federal court, and it
is ultimately the Court's holding today. It neatly resolves a
problem that has bedeviled lower courts, see 997 F. 2d 355,
357-358 (CA7 1993) (decision below); Young v. Kenny, supra,
at 877 (discussing cases), legal commentators, see Schwartz,

(listing articles), and law students (some of whom doubtlesshave run up against a case like this in law-school exams).

The favorable-termination requirement avoids the knottystatute-of-limitations problem that arises if federal courts
dismiss $ 1983 suits filed before an inmate pursues federalhabeas, and (because the statute-of-limitations clock does not
start ticking until an inmate's conviction is set aside) it doesso without requiring federal courts to stay, and therefore to
retain on their dockets, prematurely filed $ 1983 suits. See
ante, at 489.4It may be that the Court's analysis takes it no further than

I would thus go, and that any objection I may have to theCourt's opinion is to style, not substance. The Court acknowledges the habeas exhaustion requirement and explainsthat it is the reason that the habeas statute "intersect[s]"

4 The requirement that a state prisoner seeking $ 1983 damages for unlawful conviction or confinement be successful in state court or on federal
habeas strikes me as soundly rooted in the statutory scheme. Because
"Congress has determined that habeas corpus is the appropriate remedy
for state prisoners attacking the validity of the fact or length of their
confinement, [a] specific determination [that] override[s] the general terms
of $ 1983," Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 490 (1973), a state prisoner
whose constitutional attacks on his confinement have been rejected by
state courts cannot be said to be unlawfully confined unless a federal
habeas court declares his "custody [to be] in violation of the Constitution
or laws or treaties of the United States," 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a). An unsuccessful federal habeas petitioner cannot, therefore, consistently with the
habeas statute, receive $ 1983 damages for unlawful confinement. That is
not to say, however, that a state prisoner whose request for release has
been (or would be) rejected by state courts or by a federal habeas court
is necessarily barred from seeking any $ 1983 damages for violations of his
constitutional rights. If a $ 1983 judgment in his favor would not demonstrate the invalidity of his confinement he is outside the habeas statute
and may seek damages for a constitutional violation even without showing
"favorable termination." A state prisoner may, for example, seek damages for an unreasonable search that produced evidence lawfully or harmlessly admitted at trial, or even nominal damages for, say, a violation of
his right to procedural due process, see Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 266
(1978). See ante, at 487, and n. 7.

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
in this case with $ 1983, which does not require exhaustion,
see ante, at 480; it describes the issue it faces as "the same"
as that in Preiser, ante, at 483; it recites the principle that
common-law tort rules " `provide the appropriate starting
point for the inquiry under $ 1983,' " ibid. (quoting Carey v.
Piphus, 435 U. S., at 257-258); and it does not transpose onto

$ 1983 elements of the malicious-prosecution tort that are
incompatible with the policies of $ 1983 and the habeas statute as relevant to claims by state prisoners. The Court's
opinion can be read as saying nothing more than that now,
after enactment of the habeas statute and because of it,
prison inmates seeking $ 1983 damages in federal court
for unconstitutional conviction or confinement must satisfy a requirement analogous to the malicious-prosecution
tort's favorable-termination requirement. Cf. ante, at 491
(Thomas, J., concurring).

That would be a sensible way to read the opinion, in part
because the alternative would needlessly place at risk the
rights of those outside the intersection of $ 1983 and the
habeas statute, individuals not "in custody" for habeas purposes. If these individuals (people who were merely fined,
for example, or who have completed short terms of imprisonment, probation, or parole, or who discover (through no fault
of their own) a constitutional violation after full expiration
of their sentences), like state prisoners, were required to
show the prior invalidation of their convictions or sentences
in order to obtain $ 1983 damages for unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, the result would be to deny any federal forum for claiming a deprivation of federal rights to
those who cannot first obtain a favorable state ruling. The
reason, of course, is that individuals not "in custody" cannot
invoke federal habeas jurisdiction, the only statutory mechanism besides $ 1983 by which individuals may sue state
officials in federal court for violating federal rights. That
would be an untoward result.

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
It is one thing to adopt a rule that forces prison inmates
to follow the federal habeas route with claims that fall within
the plain language of $ 1983 when that is necessary to prevent a requirement of the habeas statute from being undermined. That is what the Court did in Preiser v. Rodriguez,
411 U. S., at 489-492, and that is what the Court's rule would
do for state prisoners. Harmonizing $ 1983 and the habeas
statute by requiring a state prisoner seeking damages for
unconstitutional conviction to establish the previous invalidation of his conviction does not run afoul of what we have
called, repeatedly, "[t]he very purpose of " $ 1983: "to interpose the federal courts between the States and the people,
as guardians of the people's federal rights." Mitchum v.
Foster, 407 U. S. 225, 242 (1972); see also Pulliam v. Allen,
466 U. S. 522, 541 (1984); Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla.,
457 U. S. 496, 503 (1982). A prisoner caught at the intersection of $ 1983 and the habeas statute can still have his attack
on the lawfulness of his conviction or confinement heard in
federal court, albeit one sitting as a habeas court; and,
depending on the circumstances, he may be able to obtain

$ 1983 damages.

It would be an entirely different matter, however, to shut
off federal courts altogether to claims that fall within the
plain language of $ 1983. "[I]rrespective of the common law
support" for a general rule disfavoring collateral attacks,
the Court lacks the authority to do any such thing absent
unambiguous congressional direction where, as here, reading $ 1983 to exclude claims from federal court would run
counter to "$ 1983's history" and defeat the statute's "purpose." Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U. S., at 158. Consider the case
of a former slave framed by Ku Klux Klan-controlled lawenforcement officers and convicted by a Klan-controlled state
court of, for example, raping a white woman; and suppose
that the unjustly convicted defendant did not (and could
not) discover the proof of unconstitutionality until after his

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
release from state custody. If it were correct to say that$ 1983 independently requires a person not in custody to establish the prior invalidation of his conviction, it would havebeen equally right to tell the former slave that he could not
seek federal relief even against the law-enforcement officers
who framed him unless he first managed to convince thestate courts that his conviction was unlawful. That would

be a result hard indeed to reconcile either with the purposeof $ 1983 or with the origins of what was "popularly known
as the Ku Klux Act," Collins v. Hardyman, 341 U. S. 651,657 (1951), the statute having been enacted in part out of
concern that many state courts were "in league with thosewho were bent upon abrogation of federally protected
rights," Mitchum v. Foster, supra, at 240; cf. Cong. Globe,
42d Cong., 1st Sess., 577 (1871) (Sen. Trumbull explainingthat, under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, "the Federal Government has a right to set aside . . . action of the State au-thorities" that deprives a person of his Fourteenth Amendment rights). It would also be a result unjustified by thehabeas statute or any other post-$ 1983 enactment.

Nor do I see any policy reflected in a congressional enact-ment that would justify denying to an individual today federal damages (a significantly less disruptive remedy than an
order compelling release from custody) merely because he
was unconstitutionally fined by a State, or to a person who
discovers after his release from prison that, for example,
state officials deliberately withheld exculpatory material.
And absent such a statutory policy, surely the common law
can give us no authority to narrow the "broad language" of

$ 1983, which speaks of deprivations of "any" constitutional
rights, privileges, or immunities, by "[e]very" person acting
under color of state law, and to which "we have given full
effect [by] recognizing that $ 1983 `provide[s] a remedy, to be
broadly construed, against all forms of official violation of
federally protected rights.' " Dennis v. Higgins, 498 U. S.
439, 443, 445 (1991) (quoting Monell v. New York City Dept.
of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 700-701 (1978)).

In sum, while the malicious-prosecution analogy providesa useful mechanism for implementing what statutory analysis requires, congressional policy as reflected in enacted stat-utes must ultimately be the guide. I would thus be clear
that the proper resolution of this case (involving, of course,a state prisoner) is to construe $ 1983 in light of the habeas
statute and its explicit policy of exhaustion. I would notcast doubt on the ability of an individual unaffected by the
habeas statute to take advantage of the broad reach of$ 1983.

v. SHALALA,SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 93-120. Argued April 18, 1994--Decided June 24, 1994
Medicare reimburses provider hospitals for the costs of certain educational

activities, including the cost of graduate medical education (GME) services furnished by the hospital or its affiliated medical school, 42 CFR

$$ 413.85, 413.17(a). However, reimbursement of educational activities
is limited by (1) an "anti-redistribution" principle, providing that the
Medicare program's intent is to support activities that are "customarily
or traditionally carried on by providers in conjunction with their operations," but that the program should not "participate in increased costs
resulting from redistribution of costs from educational institutions . . .
to patient care institutions," $ 413.85(c) (emphasis added); and (2) a "community support" principle, providing that Medicare will not assume the
cost for educational activities previously borne by the community, ibid.
Petitioner teaching hospital, a qualified Medicare provider, sought no
reimbursement for its nonsalary-related (administrative) GME costs
before 1984, and those costs were borne by its affiliated medical college.
In fiscal year 1985, the fiscal intermediary disallowed the hospital's
claim for reimbursement for such costs, but the Provider Reimbursement Review Board reversed in part, allowing reimbursement. Respondent Secretary reinstated the fiscal intermediary's ruling, concluding that reimbursement for the nonsalary GME costs borne in prior
years by the medical college would constitute an impermissible redistribution under $ 413.85(c). As an independent ground, she concluded that
the community support principle also barred reimbursement. The District Court and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: The Secretary's interpretation of the anti-redistribution principle is

reasonable. Because its application suffices to deny reimbursement of
the disputed costs in this case, there is no need to decide the validity
of the Secretary's interpretation of the community support language.
Pp. 512-518.

(a) As petitioner's challenge is to the Secretary's interpretation of
her own regulation, the Secretary's interpretation must be given controlling effect unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. Broad deference is all the more warranted here because the

Syllabus
regulation concerns a complex and highly technical program in which
the identification and classification of relevant criteria require significant expertise and entail the exercise of judgment grounded in policy
concerns. Pp. 512-513.

(b) The meaning of $ 413.85(c)'s relevant sentence is straightforward:
Its first clause defines the scope of educational activities for which reimbursement may be sought, and its second clause provides that the
costs of such activities will not be reimbursed if they result from a shift
of costs from an educational, to a patient care, facility. The Secretary's
interpretation of the anti-redistribution principle gives full effect to
both clauses, allowing reimbursement for costs of educational programs
traditionally engaged in by a hospital, while denying reimbursement
for costs previously incurred and paid by a medical school. It is not
only a plausible interpretation, but also the most sensible interpretation
the language will bear. The Secretary's reliance on a hospital's and
medical school's own historical cost allocations is a simple and effective
way of determining whether a prohibited redistribution has occurred.
Pp. 513-514.

(c) Petitioner's argument that $ 413.85(c) prohibits the redistribution
of activities, not costs, ignores the second clause of the critical sentence,
which refers on its face to the "redistribution of costs." Moreover, the
term "costs" is used without condition. Even if the Secretary's interpretation were not far more consistent with the regulation's unqualified
language, her construction is a reasonable one which must be afforded
controlling weight. Petitioner has presented no persuasive evidence to
support its second argument, that the Secretary has been inconsistent
in applying the anti-redistribution principle. Petitioner's argument
that the regulation's language is "precatory" or "aspirational" in nature,
and thus lacking in operative force, is also unpersuasive, since the antiredistribution clause lays down a bright line for distinguishing permissible from impermissible reimbursement. Pp. 514-518.

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
Although Medicare reimburses provider hospitals for thecosts of certain educational activities, the program is forbidden by regulation from "participat[ing] in increased costsresulting from redistribution of costs from educational institutions . . . to patient care institutions." 42 CFR $ 413.85(c)(1993) (emphasis added). In denying reimbursement for the
disputed costs in this case, the Secretary of Health andHuman Services interpreted this provision to bar reimbursement of educational costs that were borne in prior years notby the requesting hospital, but by the hospital's affiliated
medical school. The dispositive question is whether theSecretary's interpretation is a reasonable construction of
the regulatory language. We conclude that it is.

of Health and Human Services (Secretary) to issue regu-lations defining reimbursable costs and otherwise giving

content to the broad outlines of the Medicare statute.$ 1395x(v)(1)(A). That authority encompasses the discretion
to determine both the "reasonable cost" of services and the"items to be included" in the category of reimbursable services. Ibid. Acting under the statute, the Secretary, by reg-ulation, permits reimbursement for the costs of "approved
educational activities" conducted by hospitals. 42 CFR$ 413.85(a)(1) (1993). The regulations define "approved educational activities" as "formally organized or planned programs of study usually engaged in by providers in order to
enhance the quality of patient care." $ 413.85(b).Graduate medical education (GME) programs are one category of approved educational activities. GME programsgive interns and residents clinical training in various medical
specialties. Because participants learn both by treating pa-tients and by observing other physicians do so, GME programs take place in a patient care unit (most often in a teach-ing hospital), rather than in a classroom. Hospitals are
entitled to recover the "net cost" of GME and other approved
educational activities, a figure "determined by deducting,from a provider's total costs of these activities, revenues it

receives from tuition." $ 413.85(g). A hospital may includeas a reimbursable GME cost not only the costs of services
it furnishes, but also the costs of services furnished by thehospital's affiliated medical school. $ 413.17(a).

That brings us to the regulation here in question. Section413.85(c) sets forth conditions governing the reimbursement
of educational activities.1 In a sentence referred to by the

1 Title 42 CFR $ 413.85(c) provides in full:

and residents, and various paramedical specialties. These programs contribute to the quality of patient care within an institution and are necessary to meet the community's needs for medical and paramedical per512us2$85L 01-08-98 12:36:09 PAGES OPINPGT

redistribution of costs from educational institutions or unitsto patient care institutions or units."

Ibid. In a portion ofthe regulation known as the "community support" principle,

$ 413.85(c) also states that the costs of educational activities"should be borne by the community," but that "[u]ntil communities undertake to bear these costs, the [Medicare] pro-gram will participate appropriately in the support of these

Thomas Jefferson University Hospital (Hospital) is a 700-bed teaching hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The
Hospital has been a qualified Medicare provider since theprogram took effect in 1966. Petitioner Thomas Jefferson
University (University) is a private, not-for-profit educa-tional institution that operates the Hospital and other
entities, including the Jefferson Medical College (MedicalCollege). As a teaching facility, the Hospital provides

sonnel. It is recognized that the costs of such educational activities
should be borne by the community. However, many communities have
not assumed responsibility for financing these programs and it is necessary that support be provided by those purchasing health care. Until
communities undertake to bear these costs, the [Medicare] program will
participate appropriately in the support of these activities. Although the
intent of the program is to share in the support of educational activities
customarily or traditionally carried on by providers in conjunction with
their operations, it is not intended that this program should participate
in increased costs resulting from redistribution of costs from educational
institutions or units to patient care institutions or units."

The language in $ 413.85(c) has been in effect since the beginning of the
Medicare program, although it was formerly designated 42 CFR $ 405.421
(1977) and 20 CFR $ 405.421 (1967).

Opinion of the Court
Medicare-approved GME programs for postgraduate internsand residents in numerous medical specialties. The programs are conducted at the Hospital by Medical College fac-ulty. Because of their common ownership by the University,
the Hospital and the Medical College are considered affiliated
or "related" organizations under Medicare regulations. 42CFR $ 413.17(a) (1993). As a result, the Hospital is entitled

to reimbursement for all eligible patient-care, educational,and administrative costs carried on the books of the Medical
College. Ibid.Nevertheless, for reasons not clear from the record, the
Hospital did not seek reimbursement for any GME costs during the first eight years of the Medicare program's existence.
During the next 10 years, however, from 1974 through 1983,
the Hospital sought and received reimbursement for three
categories of salary-related GME costs: (1) salaries paid by
the Hospital to Medical College faculty for services rendered
to the Hospital's Medicare patients; (2) salaries paid by the
Hospital to residents and interns; and (3) funds transferred
internally from the Hospital to the Medical College as
payment for faculty time devoted to the Hospital's GME
program. The Hospital did not seek reimbursement during that period for its other, non-salary-related GME
costs (namely, the costs of administering the Hospital's

GME programs), and those costs were borne by the Medical College.

In 1983, Congress adopted a more restrictive method of
reimbursing hospitals for inpatient medical services, see 42
U. S. C. $ 1395ww(d) (1988 ed. and Supp. IV), but it retained
the more lenient method of reimbursement for medical education costs. 42 U. S. C. $ 1395ww(a)(4) (1988 ed., Supp. IV).
In 1984, when the new cost reimbursement regime was implemented, the Hospital reviewed its claim for costs associated with its GME programs to determine whether it was
identifying all costs eligible for reimbursement. This review resulted in an increased claim reflecting clerical costs

The following year, in an effort to further refine its costallocation techniques, the Hospital retained an accounting

firm to compute the Hospital's total GME costs for fiscal year1985, the year here in question. Fiscal year 1985 later became especially significant because, under a new reimburse-ment scheme enacted in 1986, it is considered the Hospital's
base period, to which all later claims for GME cost reim-bursement will be tied. See 42 U. S. C. $ 1395ww(h). After
completing the cost study, the accounting firm reported thatthe Hospital had incurred GME program costs totaling $8.8
million, a figure that included direct and indirect administra-tive costs not previously claimed by the Hospital. The report was submitted to petitioner's assigned fiscal interme-diary, whose function is to review petitioner's annual cost
reports and to calculate the appropriate level of reimburse-ment under applicable statutes and regulations. See 42
CFR $ 405.1803 (1993). Although petitioner sought reim-bursement for the full $8.8 million, the fiscal intermediary
allowed only those salary-related costs that had been reim-bursed earlier (after adjustment for inflation). The fiscal
intermediary disallowed reimbursement for all nonsalary-related GME costs that the report identified (amounting
to approximately $2.9 million). App. to Pet. for Cert. 10a.Petitioner then appealed to the Provider Reimbursement
Review Board, an intermediate appellate tribunal withinthe Department, which reversed the decision of the fiscal
intermediary in part and allowed reimbursement for allof the GME costs documented in the cost study.

decision and reinstated the fiscal intermediary's ruling. TheSecretary concluded that the anti-redistribution clause of

Opinion of the Court

$ 413.85(c) prohibits the shift of approved educational costsfrom an educational unit to a patient-care unit, even if the

educational activities for which reimbursement is sought arethe kind of activities traditionally engaged in by Medicare
providers. Id., at 35a. Since the nonsalary GME costs
here in issue were borne in prior years by the Medical Col-lege, the Secretary ruled that reimbursement of these costs

would constitute an impermissible "redistribution of costs"under $ 413.85(c).

Ibid.
The Secretary also relied on the community support lan-guage in $ 413.85(c) as an independent ground for denying

the requested reimbursement. According to the Secretary,
this language prohibits Medicare reimbursement for educational activities that "have been historically borne by the
community." Ibid. That the Hospital had failed to seek
reimbursement for the disputed costs in previous years was,
in the Secretary's view, "evidence of the communit[y's] support for these activities." Ibid. "To allow the community
to withdraw that support and pass these costs to the Medicare program" would violate the community support principle and would "encourage the community to abdicate its
commitment to education to an insurance program intended
to provide care for the elderly." Ibid.

Petitioner filed a petition for review in the District Court
seeking reimbursement for the $2,861,247 in GME costs
that the Secretary had disallowed. Id., at 10a. On crossmotions for summary judgment, the court ruled in the
Secretary's favor, accepting her interpretation of the

Udall v. Tallman, 380 U. S. 1, 16 (1965). Our task is not todecide which among several competing interpretations best

serves the regulatory purpose. Rather, the agency's in-terpretation must be given " `controlling weight unless it
is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.' "Ibid. (quoting Bowles v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U. S.
410, 414 (1945)). In other words, we must defer to the Sec-retary's interpretation unless an "alternative reading is compelled by the regulation's plain language or by other indica-tions of the Secretary's intent at the time of the regulation's
promulgation." Gardebring v. Jenkins, 485 U. S. 415, 430(1988). This broad deference is all the more warranted
when, as here, the regulation concerns "a complex and highlytechnical regulatory program," in which the identification
and classification of relevant "criteria necessarily requiresignificant expertise and entail the exercise of judgment
grounded in policy concerns." Pauley v. BethEnergy Mines,Inc., 501 U. S. 680, 697 (1991).

Opinion of the Court
language of $ 413.85(c). Because we conclude that the Secre-tary's interpretation of the anti-redistribution clause is neither " `plainly erroneous [n]or inconsistent with the regula-tion,' "

Tallman, supra, at 16-17, and because its application
suffices to deny reimbursement of the disputed costs in this
case, we need not pass upon the Secretary's interpretationof the community support language.

The anti-redistribution clause is contained in the final sen-tence of $ 413.85(c), which states:

"Although the intent of the [Medicare] program is to
share in the support of educational activities customarily or traditionally carried on by providers in con-junction with their operations, it is not intended that

this program should participate in increased costs re-sulting from

redistribution of costs from educational institutions or units to patient care institutions or units."(Emphasis added.)

The meaning of this sentence is straightforward. Its intro-ductory clause defines the scope of educational activities for
which reimbursement may be sought: To be eligible for reim-bursement, the activity must be one that is "customarily or
traditionally carried on by providers in conjunction withtheir operations." It is the language that follows, however,
that imposes the relevant restriction on cost redistribution.
The second clause provides that, notwithstanding the activ-ity for which reimbursement is sought, the Medicare program will not participate in the "redistribution of costs fromeducational institutions or units to patient care institutions
or units."

The Secretary's interpretation gives full effect to both
clauses of the relevant sentence. The Secretary interprets
the regulation to allow reimbursement for costs of educational programs traditionally engaged in by hospitals, but,
at the same time, to deny reimbursement for "cost[s] previously incurred and paid by a medical school." Brief for

514 THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIV. v. SHALALA

Opinion of the Court
Respondent 26 (emphasis deleted); see also $ 413.85(b) (defin-ing "approved educational activities" that are eligible for reimbursement as "programs of study usually engaged in byproviders in order to enhance the quality of patient care").
The Secretary's reading is not only a plausible interpretation
of the regulation; it is the most sensible interpretation thelanguage will bear.

The circumstance addressed by the anti-redistributionclause is a hospital's submission of "increased costs" arising
from approved educational activities. The regulation pro-vides, in unambiguous terms, that the "costs" of these educational activities will not be reimbursed when they are the
result of a "redistribution," or shift, of costs from an "educational" facility to a "patient care" facility, even if the activities that generated the costs are the sort "customarily or
traditionally carried on by providers in conjunction with
their operations." $ 413.85(c). The Secretary's reliance on
a hospital's own historical cost allocations, along with those
of an affiliated medical school, is a simple and effective way
of determining whether a prohibited "redistribution of costs"
has occurred. Indeed, one would be hard pressed to come
up with an alternative method to identify the shifting of
costs from one entity to another.

Petitioner advances three separate arguments for not
deferring to the Secretary's interpretation of the antiredistribution clause. None is persuasive.

First, petitioner asserts that the "clear meaning" of the
anti-redistribution clause is to allow reimbursement for the
costs of activities traditionally carried on by hospitals (e. g.,
clinical training of residents and interns), but to deny reimbursement for costs incurred in activities traditionally carried on by educational institutions (e. g., classroom training).
Pet. for Cert. 14. In other words, according to petitioner,
the redistribution that is prohibited is the redistribution
of activities, not the redistribution of costs. Brief for Petitioner 20.

515Cite as: 512 U. S. 504 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
This argument is mistaken, for it ignores the second clauseof the critical sentence, which refers, on its face, to the "redistribution of costs," not the "redistribution of activities."The term "costs," moreover, is used without condition.
Nothing in the plain language suggests that the prohibitionon "redistribution of costs" is limited to the costs of certain
activities (such as classroom instruction) carried on by aneducational unit. The clear inference from the language is
that the shift of any reimbursable costs from an "educationalinstitutio[n] or uni[t]" to a "patient care institutio[n] or uni[t]"
is prohibited. The Secretary's interpretation of the anti-redistribution principle is thus far more consistent with the
regulation's unqualified language than the interpretationadvanced by petitioner. But even if this were not so, the
Secretary's construction is, at the very least, a reasonableone, and we are required to afford it "controlling weight."
Bowles v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U. S., at 414.Second, petitioner argues that the Secretary has been
inconsistent in her interpretation of the anti-redistributionprovision. While it is true that an agency's interpretation
of a statute or regulation that conflicts with a prior interpre-tation is " `entitled to considerably less deference' than a consistently held agency view," INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480U. S. 421, 446, n. 30 (1987) (quoting

Watt v. Alaska, 451 U. S.259, 273 (1981)), that maxim does not apply here because

petitioner fails to present persuasive evidence that the Sec-retary has interpreted the anti-redistribution provision in an
inconsistent manner.3In an attempt to find an inconsistency, petitioner points to
a 1978 internal operating memorandum issued by the HealthCare Financing Administration (HCFA) that addressed the

3 The dissent seeks to demonstrate that the Secretary has been inconsistent in her application of the community support principle. See post,
at 520-522. We see no need to dispute that proposition; as indicated
above, we express no view on the validity of the Secretary's interpretation
of the community support clause.

Opinion of the Court
reimbursement of costs incurred by medical schools affiliatedwith providers. Intermediary Letter No. 78-7 (Feb. 1978),

App. to Pet. for Cert. 64a-66a. The intermediary letterdetailed various categories and amounts of educational
expenses incurred by affiliated medical schools that mightbe allowable to providers, but did not mention the antiredistribution limitation. Petitioner's attempt to infer fromthat silence the existence of a contrary policy fails because
the intermediary letter did not purport to be a compre-hensive review of all conditions that might be placed on
reimbursement of educational costs. By its own terms, theintermediary letter attempted to review only a "number of
situations" relating to the reimbursement of educationalcosts--namely, "situations rais[ing] questions about the reasonableness of [medical school faculty] costs as allowablehospital costs and the appropriateness of the bases used in
allocating them to the hospital." Id., at 64a. It is not sur-prising, then, that the letter did not address the antiredistribution principle, and the mere failure to address ithere hardly establishes an inconsistent policy on the part of
the Secretary.4

4 Petitioner further relies on an exchange of memoranda within HCFA
in 1982 regarding the University of Oregon's health training programs.
App. 22-26. In response to an internal agency memorandum identifying
the antiredistribution clause and requesting additional clarification on
the scope of reimbursable educational activities, the Director of HCFA's
Division of Institutional Services responded, in part, that "[t]he allocation of costs to a hospital from a related medical school is governed by
Intermediary Letter 78-7," and failed to discuss the redistribution issue.
Id., at 25. This omission likewise fails to manifest a contrary policy. Indeed, a subsequent memorandum issued in 1985 from the Director of
HCFA's Division of Hospital Payment Policy stated that "[t]he fact that
[the redistribution issue] is not mentioned in the subject memorandum
does not change the basic policy as espoused in 42 CFR [$ 413.85(c),]"
which provides "that where costs for items and services were previously
borne by a medical school, their allocation to a university hospital represents a redistribution of costs from an educational institution to a patient
care institution." Id., at 27.

517Cite as: 512 U. S. 504 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
Likewise, contrary to the dissent's suggestion, post, at
520-522, the mere fact that in 1974 a fiscal intermediary may
have allowed reimbursement to petitioner for GME costs
that appear to have violated the anti-redistribution clause
does not render the Secretary's interpretation of that clause
invalid. For even if petitioner could show that such allowance was approved by--or even brought to the attention of--
the Secretary or her designate at the time, "[t]he Secretary
is not estopped from changing a view she believes to have
been grounded upon a mistaken legal interpretation." Good
Samaritan Hospital v. Shalala, 508 U. S. 402, 417 (1993).
And under the circumstances of this case, "where the
agency's interpretation of [its regulation] is at least as plausible as competing ones, there is little, if any, reason not to
defer to its construction." Id., at 417.

Finally, petitioner contends that we should ignore the
Secretary's interpretation of the anti-redistribution clause
because the language of the regulation is "precatory" and
"aspirational" in nature, and thus lacking in operative force.
See Brief for Petitioner 31-32. We do not lightly assume
that a regulation setting forth specific limitations on the reimbursement of costs under a federal program is devoid of
substantive effect. That is especially so when, as here, the
language in question speaks not in vague generalities but
in precise terms about the conditions under which reimbursement is, and is not, available. Whatever vagueness
may be found in the community support language that precedes it, the anti-redistribution clause lays down a bright line
for distinguishing permissible from impermissible reimbursement: Educational costs will not be reimbursed if they
are the result of a "redistribution of costs from educational
institutions or units to patient care institutions or units."

$ 413.85(c). The Secretary was well within her discretion to
interpret this language as imposing a substantive limitation
on reimbursement.

Thomas, J., dissenting
In sum, the Secretary's construction of the anti-redistribution principle is faithful to the regulation's plain

language, and the application of this language suffices to barreimbursement of the costs claimed in this case. For these
reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

It is so ordered.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
O'Connor, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

The Court's opinion reads as if this were a case of modelagency action. As the Court views matters, 42 CFR

$ 413.85(c) (1993) is "unambiguous," ante, at 514, and re-spondent Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) has always been "faithful to the regulation's plain lan-guage,"

ante this page. That plain language, according tothe Court, required the Secretary to disallow the reimbursement petitioner sought. The Court's account is hardly anaccurate portrayal of this case. When the case is properly
viewed, I cannot avoid the conclusion that the Secretary'sconstruction of $ 413.85(c) runs afoul of the plain meaning of
the regulation and therefore is contrary to law, in violationof the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. $ 706(2)(A).
I therefore respectfully dissent.

I
The Court holds that $ 413.85(c) has substantive content,reasoning that "the language in question speaks not in vague

generalities but in precise terms about the conditions underwhich reimbursement is, and is not, available." Ante, at
517. In my view, however, $ 413.85(c) is cast in vague aspi-rational terms, and it strains credulity to read the regulation
as imposing any restriction on the reimbursability of thecosts of graduate medical education (GME) or other approved educational expenses. On the contrary, subsection(c) appears to be nothing more than a precatory statement
of purpose that imposes no substantive restrictions.

Subsection (c), in stark contrast to the remainder of$ 413.85, reads more like a preamble than a law. See ante,

at 507-508, n. 1 (quoting $ 413.85(c)).1 In the communitysupport portion of $ 413.85(c), the Secretary praises the benefits of approved educational programs and expresses a beliefthat communities "should" pay for such programs. The subsection then announces the Secretary's intention to supportsuch activities "appropriately," limited only by the vague
suggestion that at some point in the future a restructuringof fiscal priorities at the "community" level may obviate the
need for federal support. The anti-redistribution principleis no less precatory than the community support principle.
It states two "intent[ions]": first, to pay for the "customar[y]and traditiona[l]" educational activities of Medicare providers, and, second, to avoid reimbursing expenses that shouldbe borne by educational institutions affiliated with teaching
hospitals. I would not permit the Secretary to transformby "interpretation" what self-evidently are mere generalized
expressions of intent into substantive rules of reimbursa-bility. Cf.

Stinson v. United States, 508 U. S. 36, 45 (1993)(an agency's interpretation of its own regulation cannot be

sustained if " `plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the reg-ulation' ") (quoting Bowles v. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325
U. S. 410, 414 (1945)). See also Udall v. Tallman, 380 U. S.1, 16-17 (1965).

We rejected a similar attempted transformation of preca-tory language in

Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.Halderman, 451 U. S. 1 (1981). There, we addressed a claim

ment, services, and habilitation" and that state governments"have an obligation to assure that public funds are not provided to any [noncomplying] institutio[n]." $$ 6010(1), (3).We held that the bill of rights did not have substantive effect:
"$ 6010, when read in the context of other more specific provisions of the Act, does no more than express a congressionalpreference for certain kinds of treatment. It is simply a

general statement of `findings' and, as such, is too thin a reedto support the rights and obligations read into it by the court
below." 451 U. S., at 19. Even though Pennhurst did notinvolve an agency regulation, its textual analysis suggests
that it is unreasonable to give substantive effect to precatory, aspirational language--as would the Secretary's construction of 42 CFR $ 413.85(c) (1993). Cf. EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 260 (1991) (Scalia, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (explaining
that "deference is not abdication, and it requires us to accept
only those agency interpretations that are reasonable in light
of the principles of construction courts normally employ").

Interestingly enough, for the first two decades of the Medicare program's operation, the Secretary's fiscal intermediaries, with her acquiescence (if not approval), gave $ 413.85(c)
precisely the same substantive effect as I would--none. During that entire period, the Secretary never invoked the subsection to deny reimbursement for previously unreimbursed
costs, and providers were actually reimbursed for such
costs despite $ 413.85(c). Indeed, contrary to the Court's
baffling assertion that "petitioner fails to present persuasive evidence that the Secretary has interpreted the antiredistribution provision in an inconsistent manner," ante, at
515, one need look no further than petitioner's brief, see
Brief for Petitioner 21-24, to find evidence of such interpretive inconsistency as to both the anti-redistribution and community support principles.

Petitioner received no Medicare reimbursement for any
GME costs from 1966 to 1973. Even though the anti512us2$85N 01-08-98 12:36:09 PAGES OPINPGT

Thomas, J., dissenting
redistribution and community support principles were in ef-fect for that entire period, see

ante, at 507-508, n. 1, petitioner was awarded reimbursement for the first time in 1974,for salary-related GME costs. Because those GME costs

were not paid for by Thomas Jefferson University Hospital
(Hospital) prior to 1974, even the Secretary's opinion belowfinds, as a matter of fact, that they were borne, to a large

extent, by Jefferson Medical College (Medical School) duringthat period. Cf. App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a (identifying public educational grants to the Medical School and MedicalSchool tuition as sources for funding the Hospital's pre-1974
GME activities). Also, the funding for those costs that came
from sources other than the Medical School (namely, hospital
fees from charges to non-Medicare beneficiaries, see ibid.)
did not come from Medicare and therefore constituted "community support." See App. to Pet. for Cert. 18a (the Secretary "views community support as any source of funding
other than the Medicare program").

Yet under the Secretary's present interpretation of

$ 413.85(c), petitioner should never have received any GME
cost reimbursement because it had not obtained such reimbursement from the beginning of the Medicare program.
To the extent the Hospital's GME costs were previously
borne by the Medical School, providing petitioner reimbursement for those costs violated the anti-redistribution principle, as presently construed. See ante, at 513 ("The Secretary interprets the regulation . . . to deny reimbursement for
`costs previously incurred and paid by a medical school' ")
(editorial revisions omitted). Indeed, the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (PRRB) explicitly recognized this
fact, finding that, on the fiscal intermediary's interpretation
of "redistribution" (adopted by the Secretary below), "[i]n
1974, the [Hospital] commenced shifting costs . . . to the
Medicare program" and that "[a]dditional cost shifting occurred in 1984 when certain clerical costs of the Medical
School were included in the [Hospital's] cost report." App.

to Pet. for Cert. 50a.2 Similarly, reimbursing petitioner forGME costs violated the community support principle, to the

extent funding for such costs had been available previouslyfrom non-Medicare sources. See ante, at 511 (where community support has been received, $ 413.85(c) "prohibitsMedicare reimbursement"). Thus, the Court's statement
that there is no "evidence that the Secretary has interpretedthe anti-redistribution provision in an inconsistent manner,"
ante, at 515, appears to be wishful thinking: Petitioner hasbeen routinely granted reimbursement which it should have
been denied under $ 413.85(c), if the Secretary's current in-terpretation is correct.

I think it reasonable to conclude that in reimbursing peti-tioner since 1974 for GME costs not reimbursed from the
inception of the Medicare program, the Secretary acted onthe basis of an interpretation of $ 413.85(c) that attached
no significance to a Medicare provider's failure in prior yearsto be reimbursed for, or to carry on its books, eligible educational costs. This conclusion has significant support inthe Secretary's roughly contemporaneous pronouncements.
Cf. Lyng v. Payne, 476 U. S. 926, 939 (1986); M. Kraus &
Bros., Inc. v. United States, 327 U. S. 614, 622 (1946) (opinionof Murphy, J.). In 1978, for example, the Secretary advised

fiscal intermediaries that reasonable GME costs incurred bya related medical school are "allowable hospital costs," Intermediary Letter No. 78-7 (Feb. 1978), without even mention-ing either the community support or the anti-redistribution
principle as potential limitations on its construction. App.to Pet. for Cert. 64a. The letter's explicit statement that
the Secretary therein addressed the "appropriateness" of"allocating [educational costs] to the hospital [in question],"

2 Because the Secretary, through the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), only modified rather than reversed the PRRB's decision, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 37a, the PRRB's opinion remains in force
to the extent consistent with the opinion of the HCFA. Cf. 42 U. S. C.

ibid., demonstrates the inaccuracy of the Court's suggestionthat the letter addressed topics entirely unrelated to the

anti-redistribution principle, ante, at 515-516; the "appropri-ateness" of allocating costs from a medical school to its affiliated hospital is precisely what the anti-redistribution principle governs, to the extent it has substantive effect at all.See 42 CFR $ 413.85(c) (1993).

Moreover, in 1982, the Secretary answered a query from afiscal intermediary concerning the relationship between the
anti-redistribution principle and Intermediary Letter 78-7with the statement that "allocation of costs to a hospital
from a related medical school is governed by Intermediary
Letter 78-7." App. 25. The Court makes much of the fact
that the 1982 memorandum did not explicitly mention the
anti-redistribution principle. Ante, at 516, n. 4. In so
doing, however, the Court overlooks the fact that the fiscal
intermediary's inquiry presented the Secretary with a
specific binary choice: Are approved educational activities
previously paid for by an affiliated educational unit either
allowable (i. e., reimbursable) hospital costs (as Intermediary
Letter No. 78-7 advised) or a prohibited redistribution of
costs under $ 413.85(c)? By answering the fiscal intermediary's pointed query with the statement that Intermediary
Letter No. 78-7 is controlling on the reimbursability of the
costs associated with such activities, see App. 25, the Secretary quite clearly (albeit implicitly) afforded the antiredistribution principle no substantive effect whatsoever.

To be sure, in 1985 the Secretary issued a memorandum
stating, without elaboration, that "[t]he fact that [the antiredistribution principle] is not mentioned in the [1982] memorandum does not change the basic policy as espoused in
[$ 413.85(c)]." Id., at 27. The 1985 memorandum's bare reference to the "policy" of $ 413.85(c), however, neither disavowed the Secretary's past interpretation of the regulation
nor set forth any alternative interpretation. The Court
thus considerably overstates matters in its suggestion that

524 THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIV. v. SHALALA

Thomas, J., dissenting
the 1985 memorandum specifically confirmed the continued
vitality of the anti-redistribution principle. Ante, at 516,
n. 4.3

Based on a reading of the undeniably precatory language
used in $ 413.85(c), confirmed by two decades of consistent
agency practice, I would hold that subsection (c) imposes no
limit on the reimbursability of approved educational activities. Cf. M. Kraus & Bros., 327 U. S., at 622 ("Not even the
Administrator's interpretations of his own regulations can
. . . add certainty and definiteness to otherwise vague language"). Instead, the subsection seems intended merely
to explain the remainder of the regulation, which addresses
the reimbursability of approved educational costs in clear,

3 Even less satisfactory is the Secretary's suggestion that her failure
to apply $ 413.85(c) in prior fiscal years is of no relevance. See Brief
for Respondent 37. The prior inconsistent conduct of the agency is quite
relevant--not because her inconsistency "estop[s]" her from changing her
view, ante, at 517 (internal quotation marks omitted)--but rather because
agency conduct, no less than express statements, can effect a construction
of statutes or regulations. Cf., e. g., Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United
States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 41-42
(1983) (holding that "[a] `settled course of behavior embodies the agency's
informed judgment that, by pursuing that course, it will carry out the
policies [of applicable statutes or regulations]' ") (quoting Atchison, T. &
S. F. R. Co. v. Wichita Bd. of Trade, 412 U. S. 800, 807-808 (1973)). Two
decades of providing reimbursement in contravention of what is now
claimed to be the community support and anti-redistribution principles
certainly constitutes a "settled course of behavior," and I find it difficult
to believe the Secretary would permit such a persistent--and costly--
error in the application of her reimbursement rules. Cf. 1991 Medicare
Explained || 706, p. 179 ("When Medicare pays for noncovered services or
it pays too much for covered services, the program will ordinarily attempt
to recover the amount of the overpayment"). A settled interpretation
that persists over time is presumptively to be preferred, see Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn., 463 U. S., at 41-42, and therefore judges are properly
suspect of sharp departures from past practice that are as unexplained as
the Secretary's in this case. Id., at 42. See also Wichita Bd. of Trade,
supra, at 807-808.

unmistakably mandatory terms. Cf. Pennhurst, 451 U. S.,at 19, n. 14.

By giving substantive effect to such a hopelessly vagueregulation, the Court disserves the very purpose behind the
delegation of lawmaking power to administrative agencies,which is to "resol[ve] . . . ambiguity in a statutory text."
Pauley v. BethEnergy Mines, Inc., 501 U. S. 680, 696 (1991).See generally

Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural ResourcesDefense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 865-866 (1984). Here,

far from resolving ambiguity in the Medicare program stat-utes, the Secretary has merely replaced statutory ambiguity
with regulatory ambiguity. It is perfectly understandable,of course, for an agency to issue vague regulations, because
to do so maximizes agency power and allows the agencygreater latitude to make law through adjudication rather
than through the more cumbersome rulemaking process.Nonetheless, agency rules should be clear and definite so that
affected parties will have adequate notice concerning theagency's understanding of the law. Cf.

FTC v. Atlantic
Richfield Co., 567 F. 2d 96, 103 (CADC 1977) (Wilkey, J.).Cf. generally 2 K. Davis & R. Pierce, Administrative Law

$ 11.5, p. 204 (3d ed. 1994) ("An agency whose powers arenot limited either by meaningful statutory standards or . . .
legislative rules poses a serious potential threat to libertyand to democracy"). The aspirational terms of $ 413.85(c)
are woefully inadequate to impart such notice.4

4 As a result of the Court's ruling today, petitioner and other Medicare
providers who, in the past, received reimbursement for GME costs in violation of the Secretary's present interpretation of $ 413.85(c) are suddenly
faced with the possibility of being sued for recoupment of the millions of
dollars of "overpayments" they received from Medicare. The Social Security Act, we have noted, "permits . . . retroactive action" within three
years by the Secretary to make " `corrective adjustments . . . where, for a
provider of services for any fiscal period, the aggregate reimbursement
produced by the methods of determining costs proves to be . . . excessive.' " Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 209 (1988)

II

A

In view of its unbelabored conclusion that $ 413.85(c) im-poses substantive limits on the reimbursability of approved

educational costs, the Court's discussion focuses primarilyon what substantive import $ 413.85(c)'s anti-redistribution
principle should be read to have. The Court finds the anti-redistribution principle "straightforward" in its meaning--
any costs that, at some previous point in time, were car-ried on the books of an affiliated educational institution
cannot subsequently be reimbursed by Medicare. Ante, at513. For the reasons previously discussed, I would hold that

$ 413.85(c) cannot reasonably be construed to impose sub-stantive restrictions on the reimbursability of approved educational costs. Nevertheless, if I had to give the principlesubstantive effect, I could not agree with the Court's sweeping construction of the principle. In my view, the Court'sreading is premised on a distortion of the text of the regulation enunciating the anti-redistribution principle, and it isthe text, of course, which must be given controlling effect.
See Bowles, 325 U. S., at 414 (holding that an agency's inter-pretation of its own regulation must comport with "the plain
words of the regulation").Under the relevant portion of $ 413.85(c), it is the

type ofeducational activity engaged in that determines whether or

not reimbursement is proper: "[T]he intent of the [Medicare]program is to share in the support of educational activities
customarily or traditionally carried on by providers in
mitted petitioner to recover reimbursement for "those medical education
costs which it has traditionally claimed and been allowed prior to 1984,"
App. to Pet. for Cert. 37a, that act of administrative grace appears to be
subject to revision at the whim of the Secretary. Cf. Heckler v. Community Health Services of Crawford Cty., Inc., 467 U. S. 51 (1984) (Secretary
not estopped from recouping overpayment to Medicare provider whose
prior reimbursement claims were made in reliance on erroneous advice of
its designated fiscal intermediary).

Thomas, J., dissenting
conjunction with their [patient care] operations." 42 CFR$ 413.85(c) (1993). The proper question under the antiredistribution principle, therefore, is not, as the Secretaryputs it, whether "[a particular provider] has traditionally
claimed and been allowed" reimbursement for a particular
category of reimbursable costs. App. to Pet. for Cert. 37a.Instead, the relevant question is whether the educational

activities for which reimbursement is sought are of a type"customarily or traditionally" engaged in by providers. If,
in a particular case, that question is answered in the nega-tive, then it would be a forbidden "redistribution" of costs to
award Medicare reimbursement for the costs associated with
the activities in question. Conversely, if the costs for which
a provider seeks reimbursement result from educational activities that are traditionally engaged in by Medicare providers, no redistribution of costs occurs when those costs
are reimbursed.

A prohibition against shifting the costs of educational
units (for example, medical or nursing schools) to patient
care units was necessary because of the Medicare program's
related-organization rule, which provides that "costs applicable to services, facilities, and supplies furnished to the provider by organizations related to the provider by common
ownership or control are includable in the allowable cost of
the provider." 42 CFR $ 413.17(a) (1993). In light of the
related-organization rule, $ 413.85(a)'s recognition of educational costs as reimbursable costs created the distinct possibility that many, if not most, of the costs arising from educational unit activities could be shifted to affiliated Medicare
providers (and therefore to the Medicare program) because,
by definition, such units engage in educational activities.
Cf. 57 Fed. Reg. 43659, 43668 (1992) (expressing the Secretary's concern that "Medicare payment for medical education
costs should not result in a redistribution of costs from the
educational institution to the provider"). Since Medicare is
primarily intended to fund health care for the elderly and

disabled, not to subsidize the education of health care profes-sionals, cf. 42 U. S. C. $ 1395c, the Secretary avoided such an

inadvertent "expan[sion] [in] the range of items and servicesfor which a provider could claim payment" by barring the
redistribution of costs from educational to patient care units.57 Fed. Reg. 43668 (1992).

The Court therefore errs in reading the term "redistribu-tion" wholly divorced from the context in which it appears.
See ante, at 513 (suggesting the first clause of the anti-redistribution principle is not even "relevant" to an understanding of the second phrase). In my view, "redistribu-tion" can only be properly understood in light of the
remainder of the sentence in which it appears and in light ofthe related-organization rule, because interpreting a statute
or regulation "is a holistic endeavor." United Sav. Assn. ofTex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S.
365, 371 (1988). Viewed in the proper textual context,$ 413.85(c)'s anti-redistribution principle simultaneously expresses an intent to fund educational activities customarilyconducted by teaching hospitals and disallows reimbursement for costs incurred by their affiliated educational unitsin conducting educational programs not customarily or traditionally engaged in by such hospitals. The Secretary's con-trary interpretation, in my view, is unworthy of deference.
Cf., e. g., Bowles, supra, at 414.There can be no question that the GME activities for
which petitioner seeks reimbursement are customarily ortraditionally engaged in by teaching hospitals. As the District Court cogently explained in Ohio State Univ. v. Secre-tary, U. S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, 777 F. Supp.
582 (SD Ohio 1991), aff 'd, 996 F. 2d 122 (CA6 1993), cert.pending, No. 93-696:

"In the case of graduate medical education, it wouldbe customary and traditional for a teaching hospital to
employ qualified physicians in various medical special-ties to select and supervise the interns and residents

enrolled in the educational program. These physicianswould need clerical and administrative staff, office space

and supplies to carry out their function[s]. Their sala-ries, the salaries of their clerical and administrative
staffs, and the cost of their office space and supplieswould all be part of the cost of the educational activity
which ultimately contributes to the quality of patientcare in the hospital." 777 F. Supp., at 587.

As a result, the anti-redistribution principle provides nobasis for denying petitioner Medicare reimbursement for
the full level of its GME costs, less tuition revenues. See$$ 413.85(a), (g).

I therefore wholeheartedly agree with the PRRB that"[t]he fact that [the Hospital] did not fully identify all of the
costs associated with its GME programs in prior years doesnot prohibit the correction of this [cost accounting] error in
the cost reporting period in contention." App. to Pet. forCert. 58a-59a. In ruling to the contrary, the Court arbitrarily subjects similarly situated Medicare providers, withidentical levels of reimbursable GME costs, to disparate reimbursement, simply because one provider may have forgonereimbursement to which it was plainly entitled as a consequence of its cost accounting procedure's failure to identifyall of the provider's reimbursable costs. Although "[m]en
must turn square corners when they deal with the Govern-ment,"

Rock Island, A. & L. R. Co. v. United States, 254U. S. 141, 143 (1920) (Holmes, J.), the manifest injustice of the

Court's result should be apparent.

B
Because, unlike the Court, I do not believe the anti-redistribution principle may reasonably be read to bar petitioner's claim for reimbursement for non-salary-related GMEcosts, I must also address petitioner's challenge to the Secretary's construction of the community support principle.Petitioner argues that interpreting the term "community

Thomas, J., dissenting
support" to include all non-Medicare sources of funding forGME costs is inconsistent with the text of $ 413.85(c). I

agree. Not only is the community support principle merelyan aspirational statement of policy, see

supra, at 519-523,
but, in my view, the other provisions of 42 CFR $ 413.85
(1993) plainly leave no role for the principle in the cost reim-bursement calculus for approved educational activities.

Section 413.85(a) authorizes a provider to "include itsnet cost of approved educational activities" in its allowable
Medicare costs and provides that the "net cost" of such ac-tivities is to be "calculated under paragraph (g) of this section." Section 413.85(g), in turn, defines "[n]et cost of approved educational activities" as the provider's "total costs
of these activities," less "revenues it receives from tuition."
Section 413.85(g) therefore clearly establishes the level of
reimbursement a provider may expect for approved educational costs, and the only source of funding that is to be offset
against such costs is tuition revenues. No other potential
sources of funding for GME activities are included in the
offset required by $ 413.85(g). Thus, the Secretary's interpretation of the community support principle as requiring,
in effect, all non-Medicare sources of funding to be offset
against total educational cost is flatly inconsistent with

$$ 413.85(a) and (g).

The plain implication of $ 413.85(g) is confirmed by its
regulatory history. Cf. Payne, 476 U. S., at 941. In 1984,
the Secretary amended the subsection's predecessor to eliminate the requirement that "grants" and "specific donations"
be offset against educational costs actually incurred. See 49
Fed. Reg. 234, 296, 313 (1984) (amending 42 CFR $ 405.421(g)
(1983)). See also 48 Fed. Reg. 39752, 39797, 39811 (1983)
(withdrawing 42 CFR $ 405.423 (1982) relating to offsets for
certain grants and gifts). The Secretary's construction of
the community support principle essentially reintroduces
grants and specific donations into the reimbursement calculus. The Secretary has thus rendered the 1984 amend512us2$85N 01-08-98 12:36:09 PAGES OPINPGT

ment to the regulation entirely superfluous, a disfavored re-sult that should be avoided where possible. See Kungys v.

United States, 485 U. S. 759, 778 (1988). Cf. also Connecti-cut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253 (1992).

Consequently, the Secretary's construction of the commu-nity support principle to impose a substantive restriction on
the reimbursability of approved educational expenses is in-consistent with the regulation. As such, the construction is
unworthy of deference. See, e. g., Stinson, 508 U. S., at 45.

III
For the foregoing reasons, the Secretary acted contraryto law, within the meaning of 5 U. S. C. $ 706(2)(A), in construing 42 CFR $ 413.85(c) (1993) as denying Medicare pro-viders the right to receive reimbursement for otherwise
eligible educational costs simply because the costs had notpreviously been reimbursed by Medicare. I would therefore
reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. I respect-fully dissent.

CONSOLIDATED RAIL CORPORATION v.GOTTSHALL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 92-1956. Argued February 28, 1994--Decided June 24, 1994*
In separate suits against petitioner Conrail, their former employer, respondents Gottshall and Carlisle each asserted a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress under the Federal Employers' Liability Act
(FELA). In Gottshall, the District Court granted summary judgment
to Conrail. In reversing and remanding for trial, the Court of Appeals
observed that most States limit recovery for negligent infliction of emotional distress through the application of one or more common-law tests.
The court declared, however, that there is a fundamental tension between such restrictive tests and FELA's liberal recovery policy, and
stated that the tests must be discarded when they bar recovery on "meritorious" FELA claims. The court held that the facts alleged in support of a FELA claim must provide a threshold assurance that there is
a likelihood of genuine and serious emotional injury, and concluded that
Gottshall had satisfied this threshold "genuineness" test and adequately
alleged the usual FELA elements, including conduct unreasonable in
the face of a foreseeable risk of harm. In Carlisle, the same court sustained a jury verdict against Conrail, "uphold[ing] for the first time a
claim under the FELA for negligent infliction of emotional distress arising from work-related stress." Although it restated its Gottshall holding, the court shifted its primary emphasis to the foreseeability of the
alleged injury and held, inter alia, that Carlisle had produced sufficient
evidence that his nervous breakdown had been foreseeable to Conrail.

Held:

1. The proper standard for evaluating FELA claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress must be derived from FELA principles and
relevant common-law doctrine. Pp. 541-549.

(a) This Court's FELA jurisprudence outlines the proper analysis
for determining whether, and to what extent, a new category of claims
should be cognizable under the statute. First, the language, purposes,
and background of the statute, along with the construction given to
the statute by this Court, must be examined. Second, because FELA

jurisprudence gleans guidance from common-law developments, the
common law's treatment of the asserted right of recovery must be considered. See, e. g., Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Buell, 480 U. S. 557,
561-562, 568-570. Pp. 541-542.

(b) Through FELA, Congress sought to compensate employee "injury" resulting from employer "negligence," 45 U. S. C. $ 51, by creating
a remedy for the many deaths and maimings that were occurring on
interstate railroads at the time the statute was enacted in 1908, see
Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S. 163, 181. Over the years, the Court has
construed FELA liberally to further this remedial goal, see, e. g., Rogers
v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500, 506. Nevertheless, the federal
question of what constitutes negligence for purposes of FELA turns
upon common-law principles, subject to such modifications as Congress
has imported into those principles in the statute itself. See Urie,
supra, at 182. Because FELA is silent on the issue of negligent infliction of emotional distress, common-law principles must play a significant
role in the Court's decision. Pp. 542-544.

(c) Although nearly all States recognize a right to recover for negligently inflicted emotional distress--that is, mental or emotional harm
(such as fright or anxiety) that is caused by another's negligence and
that is not directly brought about by a physical injury, but that may
manifest itself in physical symptoms--three major common-law "tests"
have been developed to limit that right: (1) the "physical impact test,"
which had been embraced by most of the major industrial States by
1908, but has since been abandoned in all but a few jurisdictions; (2) the
"zone of danger" test, which had been adopted by several States by
1908 and currently is followed in 14 jurisdictions; and (3) the "relative
bystander" test, which was first enunciated in 1968 and has since been
adopted by nearly half the States. Pp. 544-549.

2. The Court of Appeals applied an erroneous standard for evaluating
FELA claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress. Pp. 549-558.

(a) The lower court correctly held that such claims are cognizable
under the statute. As part of its duty to use reasonable care in furnishing employees a safe workplace, Buell, supra, at 558, a railroad has a
FELA duty to avoid subjecting its workers to negligently inflicted emotional injury. A right to recover for such injury was widely recognized
when FELA was enacted and is nearly universally recognized today.
Moreover, given the broad remedial scope this Court has accorded
FELA's "injury" term, cf. Urie, supra, at 181, there is no reason why
that term should not encompass emotional injury. Pp. 549-550.

(b) However, the Court of Appeals' standard for delimiting this
FELA duty is rejected. First, because the merit of this type of FELA
claim cannot be ascertained without reference to the common law, the

534 CONSOLIDATED RAIL CORPORATION v. GOTTSHALL

Syllabus
court erred in treating the common-law tests as mere arbitrary restrictions to be disregarded if they stand in the way of recovery on "meritorious" FELA claims. Second, the viability of the court's "genuineness"
test is questionable on its own terms, since it cannot appreciably diminish the possibility of unlimited liability for genuine claims of emotional
harm, and since it would force judges to make highly subjective determinations concerning the authenticity of particular claims. Third, the
court's reliance on foreseeability as a meaningful limitation on liability
is misplaced, since all consequences of a negligent act, no matter how
far removed, may be foreseen. Finally, the common law does not support the court's unprecedented Carlisle holding, which would impose
a duty to avoid creating a stressful work environment, and thereby
dramatically expand employers' FELA liability to cover the stresses
and strains of everyday employment. Pp. 550-554.

(c) Instead, this Court adopts the zone of danger test, which limits
recovery for emotional injury to those plaintiffs who either sustain a
physical impact as a result of the defendant's negligence or are placed
in immediate risk of physical impact by that negligence. This is the
only common-law test that exhibits both significant historical support
and continuing vitality sufficient to inform the Court's determination of
the federal question of what constitutes FELA "negligence" in this context. This test is consistent with FELA's broad remedial goals and
with the statute's purpose of alleviating the physical dangers of railroading. Even if respondents are correct that the zone of danger test arbitrarily excludes some emotional injury claims, that test best reconciles
the concerns motivating the common-law restrictions on recovery for
negligently inflicted emotional distress--the potential for a flood of trivial suits, the possibility of fraudulent claims that are difficult to detect,
and the specter of unlimited and unpredictable liability--with this
Court's FELA jurisprudence. Pp. 554-557.

3. The question whether Gottshall satisfies the zone of danger test
was not adequately briefed or argued before this Court, and should be
considered by the Court of Appeals on remand. In Carlisle, however,
judgment must be entered for Conrail on remand, because Carlisle's
work-stress-related claim plainly does not fall within the common law's
conception of the zone of danger. Pp. 557-558.

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
These cases require us to determine the proper standardfor evaluating claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress that are brought under the Federal Employers' Lia-bility Act. Because the standard adopted by the Court of
Appeals is inconsistent with the principles embodied in thestatute and with relevant common-law doctrine, we reverse
the judgments below. I

Respondents James Gottshall and Alan Carlisle eachbrought suit under the Federal Employers' Liability Act
(FELA), 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 45 U. S. C. $$ 51-60, againsttheir former employer, petitioner Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). We set forth the facts of each case in turn.

Gottshall was a member of a Conrail work crew assignedto replace a stretch of defective track on an extremely hot

and humid day. The crew was under time pressure, and sothe men were discouraged from taking scheduled breaks.

Opinion of the Court
They were, however, allowed to obtain water as needed.Two and one-half hours into the job, a worker named Richard

Johns, a longtime friend of Gottshall, collapsed. Gottshalland several others rushed to help Johns, who was pale and
sweating profusely. They were able to revive him by administering a cold compress. Michael Norvick, the crew su-pervisor, then ordered the men to stop assisting Johns and

to return to work. Five minutes later, Gottshall again wentto Johns' aid after seeing his friend stand up and collapse.
Realizing that Johns was having a heart attack, Gottshallbegan cardiopulmonary resuscitation. He continued the
process for 40 minutes.

Meanwhile, Norvick attempted to summon assistance, but
found that his radio was inoperative; unbeknownst to him,
Conrail had temporarily taken the nearest base station off
the air for repairs. Norvick drove off to get help, but by
the time he returned with paramedics, Johns had died. The
paramedics covered the body with a sheet, ordered that it
remain undisturbed until the coroner could examine it, and
directed the crew not to leave until the coroner had arrived.
Norvick ordered the men back to work, within sight of Johns'
covered body. The coroner, who arrived several hours later,
reported that Johns had died from a heart attack brought on
by the combined factors of heat, humidity, and heavy
exertion.

The entire experience left Gottshall extremely agitated
and distraught. Over the next several days, during which
he continued to work in hot and humid weather conditions,
Gottshall began to feel ill. He became preoccupied with the
events surrounding Johns' death, and worried that he would
die under similar circumstances. Shortly after Johns' funeral, Gottshall was admitted to a psychiatric institution,
where he was diagnosed as suffering from major depression
and posttraumatic stress disorder. During the three weeks
he spent at the institution, Gottshall experienced nausea, insomnia, cold sweats, and repetitive nightmares concerning

Opinion of the Court
Johns' death. He lost a great deal of weight and sufferedfrom suicidal preoccupations and anxiety. Gottshall has continued to receive psychological treatment since his dischargefrom the hospital.

Gottshall sued Conrail under FELA for negligent infliction
of emotional distress. He alleged that Conrail's negligencehad created the circumstances under which he had been

forced to observe and participate in the events surroundingJohns' death. The District Court granted Conrail's motion
for summary judgment, holding that FELA did not providea remedy for Gottshall's emotional injuries.

A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for
the Third Circuit reversed and remanded for trial. Gottshall v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 988 F. 2d 355 (1993). The
court observed that most States recognize a common-law
cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress,
but limit recovery to certain classes of plaintiffs or categories
of claims through the application of one or more tests. Id.,
at 361 (discussing "physical impact," "zone of danger," and
"relative bystander" tests). The Third Circuit suggested
that because "an emotional injury is easier to fake" than a
physical injury, these tests have been "judicially developed
to screen causes of action and send only the meritorious ones
to juries." Ibid.

The court below identified what it considered to be a fundamental tension between the restrictive attitude of the
common law toward claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress on the one hand, and the general policy underlying FELA on the other. According to the Third Circuit,
the common law places harsh and arbitrary limits on recovery for emotional injury, while FELA has consistently been
interpreted to accord liberal relief to railroad workers injured through the negligence of their employers. Id., at
367-368 (discussing cases).

In the Third Circuit's view, the only way to reconcile the
apparent tension was to give preference to the liberal recov512us2$86N 01-08-98 12:38:17 PAGES OPINPGT
538 CONSOLIDATED RAIL CORPORATION v. GOTTSHALL

Opinion of the Court
ery policy embodied in FELA over the common law: "[D]octrinal common law distinctions are to be discarded when they
bar recovery on meritorious FELA claims." Id., at 369. Determining that judges could weed out fraudulent emotional
injury claims through careful scrutiny of the facts, the court
held that the facts alleged in support of a claim under FELA
for negligent infliction of emotional distress must "provide a
threshold assurance that there is a likelihood of genuine and
serious emotional injury." Id., at 371. The Third Circuit
suggested that a court's factual inquiry might include consideration of the plaintiff 's claim in light of the present state
of the common law.

After reviewing the facts of Gottshall's case, the Third Circuit concluded that Gottshall had made a sufficient showing
that his injuries were genuine and severe. Id., at 374. Because his claim had met the court's threshold "genuineness"
test, the court next considered whether the claim adequately
alleged the usual FELA elements of breach of a duty of care
(that is, conduct unreasonable in the face of a foreseeable
risk of harm), injury, and causation. The panel majority
concluded that there were genuine issues of material fact
concerning whether Gottshall's injuries were foreseeable by
Conrail, whether Conrail had acted unreasonably, and
whether Conrail's conduct had caused cognizable injury to
Gottshall. The court therefore remanded for trial. Id., at
383.

Judge Roth dissented in part because she believed that
there was no triable issue regarding breach of duty. She
reasoned that "outside of the interruption of the communications link, the allegedly negligent conditions created by Conrail at the time of Johns' collapse consisted in fact of the
members of the work gang performing the negotiated duties
of their jobs under conditions which may indeed have been
difficult but which had occurred in the past and will probably
occur again in the future." Id., at 385. In her view, these

Opinion of the Court
negotiated duties could not support a finding of negligence.Judge Roth concluded that "Conrail could not reasonably

have foreseen that its negligence in interrupting the workgang's communication[s] link might cause James Gottshall's
severe emotional reaction to the death of Richard Johns."
Id., at 386. B

Respondent Carlisle began working as a train dispatcherfor Conrail in 1976. In this position, he was responsible for
ensuring the safe and timely movement of passengers andcargo. Aging railstock and outdated equipment made Carlisle's job difficult. Reductions in Conrail's work force re-quired Carlisle to take on additional duties and to work long
hours. Carlisle and his fellow dispatchers frequently com-plained about safety concerns, the high level of stress in their
jobs, and poor working conditions. In 1988, Carlisle becametrainmaster in the South Philadelphia yards. With this promotion came added responsibilities that forced him to workerratic hours. Carlisle began to experience insomnia, headaches, depression, and weight loss. After an extended pe-riod during which he was required to work 12- to 15-hour
shifts for weeks at a time, Carlisle suffered a nervousbreakdown.

Carlisle sued Conrail under FELA for negligent inflictionof emotional distress. He alleged that Conrail had breached
its duty to provide him with a safe workplace by forcing himto work under unreasonably stressful conditions, and that
this breach had resulted in foreseeable stress-related healthproblems. At trial, Carlisle called medical experts who testified that his breakdown and ensuing severe depression
were caused at least in part by the strain of his job. Thejury awarded Carlisle $386,500 in damages.

The Third Circuit affirmed, "uphold[ing] for the first timea claim under the FELA for negligent infliction of emotional
distress arising from work-related stress." Carlisle v. Con512us2$86N 01-08-98 12:38:17 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
solidated Rail Corp., 990 F. 2d 90, 97-98 (1993). In reject-ing Conrail's argument that Carlisle had failed to make out

a claim under FELA because he had not alleged any accidentor physical injury or impact, the court noted that in

Gottshall (decided the month before), it had "upheld recovery
under the FELA for negligent infliction of emotional dis-tress without proof of any physical impact." 990 F. 2d, at

96. Restating its holding in Gottshall, the court advisedthat, when evaluating a claim under FELA for negligently
inflicted emotional distress, district courts within the ThirdCircuit "should engage in an initial review of the factual indicia of the genuineness of a claim, taking into account broadly
used common law standards, then should apply the traditional negligence elements of duty, foreseeability, breach, and
causation in weighing the merits of that claim." 990 F. 2d,
at 98.

In the case before it, however, the court did not examine
Carlisle's suit in light of any of the various common-law tests
for dealing with negligent infliction of emotional distress
claims. Instead, it shifted its primary emphasis to the foreseeability of the alleged injury and held that "when it is reasonably foreseeable that extended exposure to dangerous
and stressful working conditions will cause injury to the
worker, the employer may be held to be liable under the
FELA for the employee's resulting injuries." Id., at 97.
The Third Circuit held that Carlisle had produced sufficient
evidence that his injury had been foreseeable to Conrail.
The court also found sufficient evidence that Conrail had
breached its duty to provide Carlisle with a safe workplace
by making his employment too demanding, and that this
breach had caused Carlisle's injury. Ibid.

Pursuant to this Court's Rule 12.2, Conrail petitioned for
review of the Third Circuit's decisions in Gottshall and Carlisle. We granted certiorari, 510 U. S. 912 (1993), to resolve
a conflict among the Courts of Appeals concerning the
threshold standard that must be met by plaintiffs bringing

claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress underFELA.

II
In these cases, we address questions left unanswered in
Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Buell, 480 U. S. 557 (1987).That case involved a FELA complaint filed by a railroad carman who alleged that the intentional and negligent actionsof his employer had caused him to suffer emotional injuries.
We rejected the railroad's contention that the FELA actionshould be barred because the conduct complained of was subject to arbitration under the terms of the Railway Labor Act,44 Stat. 577, as amended, 45 U. S. C. $ 151

et seq. See 480U. S., at 564-567. Because the record was not fully developed, however, we were unable to reach the railroad's alter-native argument that purely emotional injury was not compensable under FELA. Today, we must resolve one of thequestions reserved in

Buell: whether recovery for negligentinfliction of emotional distress is available under FELA.

2 If

we conclude that it is, we must consider the proper scopeof that availability. Our FELA jurisprudence outlines the

analysis we must undertake when deciding whether, and towhat extent, this new category of claims should be cognizable under the statute.First, as in other cases involving the scope of the statute,
we must look to FELA itself, its purposes and background,and the construction we have given it over the years. See,
e. g., id., at 561-562. Second, because "FELA jurisprudencegleans guidance from common-law developments,"

id., at 568,we must consider the common law's treatment of the right

of recovery asserted by respondents. See, e. g., MonessenSouthwestern R. Co. v. Morgan, 486 U. S. 330, 336-339 (1988)

(disallowing prejudgment interest under FELA in large partbecause such interest was unavailable at common law when
FELA was enacted); Buell, supra, at 568-570. Cf. Urie v.
Thompson, 337 U. S. 163, 174 (1949); Kernan v. AmericanDredging Co., 355 U. S. 426, 432 (1958).

A
We turn first to the statute. Section 1 of FELA providesthat "[e]very common carrier by railroad . . . shall be liable

in damages to any person suffering injury while he is em-ployed by such carrier . . . for such injury or death resulting
in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers,agents, or employees of such carrier." 45 U. S. C. $ 51. Our
task today is determining under what circumstances emo-tional distress may constitute "injury" resulting from "negligence" for purposes of the statute. As we previously haverecognized when considering $ 51, when Congress enacted
FELA in 1908, its "attention was focused primarily upon in-juries and death resulting from accidents on interstate railroads." Urie, supra, at 181. Cognizant of the physicaldangers of railroading that resulted in the death or maiming
of thousands of workers every year, Congress crafted a fed-eral remedy that shifted part of the " `human overhead' " of
doing business from employees to their employers. Tillerv. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 318 U. S. 54, 58 (1943). See
also Wilkerson v. McCarthy, 336 U. S. 53, 68 (1949) (Douglas,J., concurring) (FELA "was designed to put on the railroad
industry some of the cost for the legs, eyes, arms, and liveswhich it consumed in its operations"). In order to further
FELA's humanitarian purposes, Congress did away withseveral common-law tort defenses that had effectively barred
recovery by injured workers. Specifically, the statute abol-ished the fellow servant rule, rejected the doctrine of contributory negligence in favor of that of comparative negli512us2$86N 01-08-98 12:38:17 PAGES OPINPGT

543Cite as: 512 U. S. 532 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
gence, and prohibited employers from exempting themselvesfrom FELA through contract; a 1939 amendment abolished

the assumption of risk defense. See 45 U. S. C. $$ 51, 53-55.We have liberally construed FELA to further Congress'
remedial goal. For example, we held in Rogers v. Missouri
Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500 (1957), that a relaxed standardof causation applies under FELA. We stated that "[u]nder

this statute the test of a jury case is simply whether theproofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing theinjury or death for which damages are sought."

Id., at 506.
In Kernan, supra, we extended the reach of the principle of
negligence per se to cover injuries suffered by employees
as a result of their employers' statutory violations, even if
the injuries sustained were not of a type that the relevant
statute sought to prevent. See id., at 432-436. And in
Urie, supra, we held that occupational diseases such as silicosis constitute compensable physical injuries under FELA,
thereby rejecting the argument that the statute covered
only injuries and deaths caused by accidents. See id., at
181.

That FELA is to be liberally construed, however, does not
mean that it is a workers' compensation statute. We have
insisted that FELA "does not make the employer the insurer
of the safety of his employees while they are on duty. The
basis of his liability is his negligence, not the fact that injuries occur." Ellis v. Union Pacific R. Co., 329 U. S. 649, 653
(1947). Accord, Inman v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 361 U. S.
138, 140 (1959); Wilkerson, supra, at 61. And while "[w]hat
constitutes negligence for the statute's purposes is a federal
question," Urie, 337 U. S., at 174, we have made clear that
this federal question generally turns on principles of common
law: "[T]he Federal Employers' Liability Act is founded on
common-law concepts of negligence and injury, subject to
such qualifications as Congress has imported into those
terms," id., at 182. Those qualifications, discussed above,

Opinion of the Court
are the modification or abrogation of several common-lawdefenses to liability, including contributory negligence and

assumption of risk. See 45 U. S. C. $$ 51, 53-55. Only tothe extent of these explicit statutory alterations is FELA
"an avowed departure from the rules of the common law."
Sinkler v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 356 U. S. 326, 329 (1958).Thus, although common-law principles are not necessarily

dispositive of questions arising under FELA, unless they areexpressly rejected in the text of the statute, they are entitled to great weight in our analysis. Cf. Buell, 480 U. S.,at 568. Because FELA is silent on the issue of negligent
infliction of emotional distress, common-law principles mustplay a significant role in our decision.

B
We turn, therefore, to consider the right of recovery pur-sued by respondents in light of the common law. Cf.

Mones-sen, supra, at 336-339; Buell, 480 U. S., at 568-570. The

term "negligent infliction of emotional distress" is largelyself-explanatory, but a definitional point should be clarified
at the outset. The injury we contemplate when consideringnegligent infliction of emotional distress is mental or emotional injury, cf. id., at 568, apart from the tort law conceptsof pain and suffering. Although pain and suffering technically are mental harms, these terms traditionally "have beenused to describe sensations stemming directly from a physical injury or condition." Pearson, Liability to Bystandersfor Negligently Inflicted Emotional Harm--A Comment on
the Nature of Arbitrary Rules, 34 U. Fla. L. Rev. 477, 485,n. 45 (1982). The injury we deal with here is mental or emotional harm (such as fright or anxiety) that is caused by thenegligence of another and that is not directly brought about
by a physical injury, but that may manifest itself in physi-cal symptoms.

Nearly all of the States have recognized a right to recoverfor negligent infliction of emotional distress, as we have de512us2$86N 01-08-98 12:38:17 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
fined it.3 No jurisdiction, however, allows recovery for allemotional harms, no matter how intangible or trivial, that

might be causally linked to the negligence of another. In-deed, significant limitations, taking the form of "tests" or
"rules," are placed by the common law on the right to re-cover for negligently inflicted emotional distress, and have
been since the right was first recognized late in the lastcentury.

Behind these limitations lie a variety of policy considera-tions, many of them based on the fundamental differences
between emotional and physical injuries. "Because the eti-ology of emotional disturbance is usually not as readily apparent as that of a broken bone following an automobile acci-dent, courts have been concerned . . . that recognition of a
cause of action for [emotional] injury when not related to anyphysical trauma may inundate judicial resources with a flood
of relatively trivial claims, many of which may be imaginedor falsified, and that liability may be imposed for highly remote consequences of a negligent act." Maloney v. Conroy,208 Conn. 392, 397-398, 545 A. 2d 1059, 1061 (1988). The
last concern has been particularly significant. Emotional in-juries may occur far removed in time and space from the
negligent conduct that triggered them. Moreover, in con-trast to the situation with physical injury, there are no necessary finite limits on the number of persons who might sufferemotional injury as a result of a given negligent act.

3 There are a few exceptions. Negligent infliction of emotional distress
is not actionable in Alabama. See Allen v. Walker, 569 So. 2d 350 (Ala.
1990). It is unclear whether such a claim is cognizable in Arkansas.
Compare Mechanics Lumber Co. v. Smith, 296 Ark. 285, 752 S. W. 2d 763
(1988), with M. B. M. Co. v. Counce, 268 Ark. 269, 596 S. W. 2d 681 (1980).

Rev. 477, 507 (1982) ("The geographic risk of physical impact caused by
the defendant's negligence in most cases is quite limited, which accordingly limits the number of people subjected to that risk. There is no
similar finite range of risk for emotional harm").

Opinion of the Court
incidence and severity of emotional injuries are also moredifficult to predict than those of typical physical injuries because they depend on psychological factors that ordinarilyare not apparent to potential tortfeasors.

For all of these reasons, courts have realized that recognition of a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotionaldistress holds out the very real possibility of nearly infinite

and unpredictable liability for defendants. Courts thereforehave placed substantial limitations on the class of plaintiffs
that may recover for emotional injuries and on the injuriesthat may be compensable. See,

e. g., Thing v. La Chusa, 48
Cal. 3d 644, 654, 771 P. 2d 814, 819 (1989) ("[P]olicy considera-tions mandat[e] that infinite liability be avoided by restrictions that . . . narrow the class of potential plaintiffs"); Tobin
v. Grossman, 24 N. Y. 2d 609, 616, 249 N. E. 2d 419, 423(1969).

5 Some courts phrase the limitations in terms of

proximate causation; that is, only certain plaintiffs or injuries are reasonably foreseeable. Other courts speak of the
limitations in terms of duty; the defendant owes only a certain class of plaintiffs a duty to avoid inflicting emotional
harm. See, e. g., Pearson, supra, at 489, n. 72 (discussing
Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co., 248 N. Y. 339, 162 N. E. 99
(1928)). These formulations are functionally equivalent.
We shall refer to the common-law limitations as outlining
the duty of defendants with regard to negligent infliction of
emotional distress.

Three major limiting tests for evaluating claims alleging
negligent infliction of emotional distress have developed in
the common law. The first of these has come to be known

5 See also W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and
Keeton on Law of Torts $ 54, p. 366 (5th ed. 1984) ("It would be an entirely
unreasonable burden on all human activity if the defendant who has endangered one person were to be compelled to pay for the lacerated feelings of
every other person disturbed by reason of it, including every bystander

Opinion of the Court
as the "physical impact" test. It originated a century ago insome of the first cases recognizing recovery for negligently

inflicted emotional distress. At the time Congress enactedFELA in 1908, most of the major industrial States had embraced this test. See Throckmorton, Damages for Fright,34 Harv. L. Rev. 260, 263-264, and n. 25 (1921).

6 Under the

physical impact test, a plaintiff seeking damages for emo-tional injury stemming from a negligent act must have contemporaneously sustained a physical impact (no matter howslight) or injury due to the defendant's conduct. Most jurisdictions have abandoned this test, but at least five Statescontinue to adhere to it.

7

The second test has come to be referred to as the "zone ofdanger" test. It came into use at roughly the same time as

the physical impact test, and had been adopted by severaljurisdictions at the time FELA was enacted. See Throckmorton, supra, at 264-265, and n. 28.8 See also Bohlen,Right to Recover for Injury Resulting from Negligence
Without Impact, 50 Am. L. Reg. 141, and nn. 3-5 (1902). Per-haps based on the realization that "a near miss may be as
frightening as a direct hit," Pearson, U. Fla. L. Rev., at 488,the zone of danger test limits recovery for emotional injury
to those plaintiffs who sustain a physical impact as a result

of a defendant's negligent conduct, or who are placed in im-mediate risk of physical harm by that conduct. That is,

The third prominent limiting test is the "relative by-stander" test, which was first enunciated in

Dillon v. Legg,68 Cal. 2d 728, 441 P. 2d 912 (1968). In Dillon, the California Supreme Court rejected the zone of danger test and sug-gested that the availability of recovery should turn, for the
most part, on whether the defendant could reasonably haveforeseen the emotional injury to the plaintiff. The court offered three factors to be considered as bearing on the ques-tion of reasonable foreseeability:

"(1) Whether plaintiff was located near the scene of theaccident as contrasted with one who was a distance
away from it. (2) Whether the shock resulted from adirect emotional impact upon plaintiff from the sensory
and contemporaneous observance of the accident, as con-trasted with learning of the accident from others after
its occurrence. (3) Whether plaintiff and the victimwere closely related, as contrasted with an absence of
any relationship or the presence of only a distant rela-tionship."

Opinion of the Court
The courts of nearly half the States now allow bystandersoutside of the zone of danger to obtain recovery in certain

circumstances for emotional distress brought on by witness-ing the injury or death of a third party (who typically must
be a close relative of the bystander) that is caused by thedefendant's negligence.

10 Most of these jurisdictions have

adopted the Dillon factors either verbatim or with varia-tions and additions, and have held some or all of these factors

to be substantive limitations on recovery.11

11 Many jurisdictions that follow the zone of danger or relative bystander

tests also require that a plaintiff demonstrate a "physical manifestation"
of an alleged emotional injury, that is, a physical injury or effect that is
the direct result of the emotional injury, in order to recover. See, e. g.,
Garvis v. Employers Mut. Casualty Co., 497 N. W. 2d 254 (Minn. 1993).

550 CONSOLIDATED RAIL CORPORATION v. GOTTSHALL

Opinion of the Court
with the Third Circuit that claims for damages for negligentinfliction of emotional distress are cognizable under FELA.

A combination of many of the factors discussed above makesthis conclusion an easy one. A right to recover for negligently inflicted emotional distress was recognized in someform by many American jurisdictions at the time FELA was
enacted, see nn. 6 and 8, supra, and this right is nearly uni-versally recognized among the States today. See

supra, at546-549. Moreover, we have accorded broad scope to the

statutory term "injury" in the past in light of FELA's reme-dial purposes. Cf. Urie, 337 U. S., at 181. We see no reason
why emotional injury should not be held to be encompassedwithin that term, especially given that "severe emotional injuries can be just as debilitating as physical injuries." Gottshall, 988 F. 2d, at 361. We therefore hold that, as part ofits "duty to use reasonable care in furnishing its employees

with a safe place to work," Buell, 480 U. S., at 558, a rail-road has a duty under FELA to avoid subjecting its workers
to negligently inflicted emotional injury. This latter duty,however, is not self-defining. Respondents defend the Third
Circuit's definition of the duty we recognize today; Conrailoffers its own proposed delineation. We consider the proposals in turn. B

When setting out its view of the proper scope of recoveryfor negligently inflicted emotional distress under FELA, the
Third Circuit explicitly refused to adopt any of the common-law tests described above; indeed, the court in

Gottshallwent so far as to state that "doctrinal common law distinctions are to be discarded when they bar recovery on merito-rious FELA claims." 988 F. 2d, at 369. Instead, the court
developed its own test, under which "[t]he issue is whetherthe factual circumstances . . . provide a threshold assurance
that there is a likelihood of genuine and serious emotionalinjury."

Id., at 371. If this threshold test is satisfied, theclaim should be evaluated in light of traditional tort concepts

512us2$86N 01-08-98 12:38:17 PAGES OPINPGT

551Cite as: 512 U. S. 532 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
such as breach of duty, injury, and causation, with the focusresting on the foreseeability of the plaintiff 's injury.

Id., at
374-375. In Gottshall, the Third Circuit did at least con-sider the plaintiff 's claim in light of the common law of negligent infliction of emotional distress as part of its factual
"genuineness" inquiry. By the time the court next appliedthe

Gottshall genuineness test, however, the common-law aspect of its analysis had completely disappeared; Carlisle'sstress-related claim was not evaluated under any of the

common-law tests. In Carlisle, the Third Circuit refined itstest to two questions--whether there was convincing evidence of the genuineness of the emotional injury claim (with
"genuine" meaning authentic and serious), and if there was,
whether the injury was foreseeable. If these questions
could be answered affirmatively by the court, there was "no
bar to recovery under the FELA." 990 F. 2d, at 98.

The Third Circuit's standard is fatally flawed in a number
of respects. First, as discussed above, because negligent infliction of emotional distress is not explicitly addressed in the
statute, the common-law background of this right of recovery
must play a vital role in giving content to the scope of an
employer's duty under FELA to avoid inflicting emotional
injury. Cf. Monessen, 486 U. S., at 336-339; Buell, supra, at
568-570; Urie, supra, at 182. By treating the common-law
tests as mere arbitrary restrictions to be disregarded if they
stand in the way of recovery on "meritorious" FELA claims,
the Third Circuit put the cart before the horse: The common
law must inform the availability of a right to recover under
FELA for negligently inflicted emotional distress, so the
"merit" of a FELA claim of this type cannot be ascertained
without reference to the common law.

Perhaps the court below believed that its focus on the perceived genuineness of the claimed emotional injury adequately addressed the concerns of the common-law courts in
dealing with emotional injury claims. But the potential for
fraudulent and trivial claims--the concern identified by the

512us2$86N 01-08-98 12:38:17 PAGES OPINPGT
552 CONSOLIDATED RAIL CORPORATION v. GOTTSHALL

Opinion of the Court
Third Circuit--is only one of the difficulties created by allow-ing actions for negligently inflicted emotional distress. A

more significant problem is the prospect that allowing suchsuits can lead to unpredictable and nearly infinite liability
for defendants. The common law consistently has sought to
place limits on this potential liability by restricting the classof plaintiffs who may recover and the types of harm for

which plaintiffs may recover. This concern underlying thecommon-law tests has nothing to do with the potential for
fraudulent claims; on the contrary, it is based upon the recog-nized possibility of

genuine claims from the essentially infinite number of persons, in an infinite variety of situations,
who might suffer real emotional harm as a result of a single
instance of negligent conduct.

Second, we question the viability of the genuineness test
on its own terms. The Third Circuit recognized that "there
must be some finite limit to the railway's potential liability"
for emotional injury claims under FELA, and suggested that
liability could be restricted through application of the genuineness test. Gottshall, supra, at 379. But as just explained, testing for the "genuineness" of an injury alone cannot appreciably diminish the possibility of infinite liability.
Such a fact-specific test, moreover, would be bound to lead to
haphazard results. Judges would be forced to make highly
subjective determinations concerning the authenticity of
claims for emotional injury, which are far less susceptible to
objective medical proof than are their physical counterparts.
To the extent the genuineness test could limit potential liability, it could do so only inconsistently. Employers such as
Conrail would be given no standard against which to regulate their conduct under such an ad hoc approach. In the
context of claims for intangible harms brought under a negligence statute, we find such an arbitrary result unacceptable.
Cf. Stadler v. Cross, 295 N. W. 2d 552, 554 (Minn. 1980).

Third, to the extent the Third Circuit relied on the concept
of foreseeability as a meaningful limitation on liability, we

512us2$86N 01-08-98 12:38:17 PAGES OPINPGT

553Cite as: 512 U. S. 532 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
believe that reliance to be misplaced. If one takes a broad
enough view, all consequences of a negligent act, no matter
how far removed in time or space, may be foreseen. Conditioning liability on foreseeability, therefore, is hardly a
condition at all. "Every injury has ramifying consequences,
like the ripplings of the waters, without end. The problem
for the law is to limit the legal consequences of wrongs to
a controllable degree." Tobin, 24 N. Y. 2d, at 619, 249
N. E. 2d, at 424. See also Thing, 48 Cal. 3d, at 668, 771 P. 2d,
at 830 ("[T]here are clear judicial days on which a court can
foresee forever and thus determine liability but none on
which that foresight alone provides a socially and judicially
acceptable limit on recovery").

This is true as a practical matter in the FELA context
as well, even though the statute limits recovery to railroad
workers. If emotional injury to Gottshall was foreseeable
to Conrail, such injury to the other seven members of his
work crew was also foreseeable. Because one need not witness an accident to suffer emotional injury therefrom, however, the potential liability would not necessarily have to end
there; any Conrail employees who heard or read about the
events surrounding Johns' death could also foreseeably have
suffered emotional injury as a result. Of course, not all of
these workers would have been as traumatized by the tragedy as was Gottshall, but many could have been. Under the
Third Circuit's standard, Conrail thus could face the potential of unpredictable liability to a large number of employees
far removed from the scene of the allegedly negligent conduct that led to Johns' death.12

12 The Third Circuit did require that the emotional injury be "reasonably" foreseeable, see Carlisle v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 990 F. 2d 90, 97
(1993), but under the circumstances, that qualifier seems to add little.
Suffice it to say that if Gottshall's emotional injury stemming from Johns'
death was reasonably foreseeable to Conrail, nearly any injury could also
be reasonably foreseeable.

554 CONSOLIDATED RAIL CORPORATION v. GOTTSHALL

Opinion of the Court
Finally, the Third Circuit in Carlisle erred in upholding "aclaim under the FELA for negligent infliction of emotional

distress arising from work-related stress." 990 F. 2d, at 97-98. We find no support in the common law for this unprecedented holding, which would impose a duty to avoid creatinga stressful work environment, and thereby dramatically expand employers' FELA liability to cover the stresses andstrains of everyday employment. Indeed, the Third Circuit's ruling would tend to make railroads the insurers of theemotional well-being and mental health of their employees.
We have made clear, however, that FELA is not an insurancestatute. See,

e. g., Ellis, 329 U. S., at 653. For the forego-ing reasons, we reject the Third Circuit's approach.

C
Conrail suggests that we adopt the common-law zone ofdanger test as delimiting the proper scope of an employer's

duty under FELA to avoid subjecting its employees to negli-gently inflicted emotional injury. We agree that the zone of
danger test best reconciles the concerns of the common lawwith the principles underlying our FELA jurisprudence.

As we did in Monessen, we begin with the state of thecommon law in 1908, when FELA was enacted. In determining in Monessen whether prejudgment interest wasavailable under FELA, we recognized that the common law
in 1908 did not allow such interest in personal injury andwrongful-death suits. Because in enacting FELA, "Congress expressly dispensed with other common-law doctrinesof that era, such as the defense of contributory negligence,"
but "did not deal at all with the equally well established doc-trine barring the recovery of prejudgment interest," we concluded that Congress intended to leave the common-law ruleintact. 486 U. S., at 337-338. In contrast, the right to recover for negligently inflicted emotional distress was wellestablished in many jurisdictions in 1908. Although at that
time, "the weight of American authority" favored the physi512us2$86N 01-08-98 12:38:17 PAGES OPINPGT

555Cite as: 512 U. S. 532 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
cal impact test, Throckmorton, 34 Harv. L. Rev., at 264, thezone of danger test had been adopted by a significant number

of jurisdictions. See n. 8, supra. Moreover, because it wasrecognized as being a progressive rule of liability that was
less restrictive than the physical impact test, the zone of danger test would have been more consistent than the physicalimpact test with FELA's broad remedial goals. See

Waube
v. Warrington, 216 Wis. 603, 608, 258 N. W. 497, 499 (1935)(discussing early emotional injury cases and referring to zone

of danger test as "the liberal rule"). Considering the ques-tion "in the appropriate historical context,"

Monessen,
supra, at 337, then, it is reasonable to conclude that Congress
intended the scope of the duty to avoid inflicting emotional
distress under FELA to be coextensive with that established
under the zone of danger test. That is, an emotional injury
constitutes "injury" resulting from the employer's "negligence" for purposes of FELA only if it would be compensable
under the terms of the zone of danger test. See 45 U. S. C.

$ 51. Cf. Urie, 337 U. S., at 182.

Current usage only confirms this historical pedigree. The
zone of danger test presently is followed by 14 jurisdictions. It therefore remains to this day a well-established
"common-law concep[t] of negligence," ibid., that is suitable
to inform our determination of the federal question of what
constitutes negligence for purposes of FELA. Cf. Buell,
480 U. S., at 568-570; Kernan, 355 U. S., at 432.

The zone of danger test also is consistent with FELA's
central focus on physical perils. We have recognized that
FELA was intended to provide compensation for the injuries and deaths caused by the physical dangers of railroad
work by allowing employees or their estates to assert damages claims. Cf. Urie, supra, at 181. By imposing liability,
FELA presumably also was meant to encourage employers
to improve safety measures in order to avoid those claims.
Cf. Wilkerson, 336 U. S., at 68 (Douglas, J., concurring). As
the Seventh Circuit has observed, FELA was (and is) aimed

512us2$86N 01-08-98 12:38:17 PAGES OPINPGT
556 CONSOLIDATED RAIL CORPORATION v. GOTTSHALL

Opinion of the Court
at ensuring "the security of the person from physical inva-sions or menaces."

Lancaster v. Norfolk & Western R. Co.,
773 F. 2d 807, 813 (1985), cert. denied, 480 U. S. 945 (1987).But while the statute may have been primarily focused on

physical injury, it refers simply to "injury," which may encompass both physical and emotional injury. We believethat allowing recovery for negligently inflicted emotional

injury as provided for under the zone of danger test bestharmonizes these considerations. Under this test, a worker
within the zone of danger of physical impact will be able torecover for emotional injury caused by fear of physical injury
to himself, whereas a worker outside the zone will not. Railroad employees thus will be able to recover for injuries--
physical and emotional--caused by the negligent conduct of
their employers that threatens them imminently with physical impact. This rule will further Congress' goal in enacting
the statute of alleviating the physical dangers of railroading.

The physical impact test, of course, would achieve many of
the same ends as the zone of danger test. We see no reason,
however, to allow an employer to escape liability for emotional injury caused by the apprehension of physical impact
simply because of the fortuity that the impact did not occur.
And the physical impact test has considerably less support
in the current state of the common law than the zone of
danger test. See supra, at 546-549.

As for the relative bystander test, we conclude that it is
an inappropriate rule in the FELA context. As an initial
matter, it was not developed until 60 years after FELA's
enactment, and therefore lacks historical support. Cf.
Monessen, supra. Moreover, in most jurisdictions that
adhere to it, this test limits recovery to persons who witness
the severe injury or death of a close family member. Only
railroad employees (and their estates) may bring FELA
claims, however, and presumably it would be a rare occurrence for a worker to witness during the course of his employment the injury or death of a close family member. In

557Cite as: 512 U. S. 532 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
any event, we discern from FELA and its emphasis on pro-tecting employees from physical harms no basis to extend

recovery to bystanders outside the zone of danger. Cf.Gaston v. Flowers Transp., 866 F. 2d 816, 820-821 (CA5
1989).Respondents decry the zone of danger test as arbitrarily
excluding valid claims for emotional injury. But "[c]harac-terizing a rule limiting liability as `unprincipled' or `arbitrary' is often the result of overemphasizing the policy con-siderations favoring imposition of liability, while at the same
time failing to acknowledge any countervailing policies andthe necessary compromise between competing and inconsistent policies informing the rule." Cameron v. Pepin, 610A. 2d 279, 283 (Me. 1992). Our FELA cases require that we
look to the common law when considering the right to re-cover asserted by respondents, and the common law restricts
recovery for negligent infliction of emotional distress on sev-eral policy grounds: the potential for a flood of trivial suits,
the possibility of fraudulent claims that are difficult forjudges and juries to detect, and the specter of unlimited and
unpredictable liability. Although some of these groundshave been criticized by commentators, they all continue to
give caution to courts. We believe the concerns that under-lie the common-law tests, and particularly the fear of unlimited liability, to be well founded.Perhaps the zone of danger test is "arbitrary" in the sense
that it does not allow recovery for all emotional distress.But it is fully consistent with our understanding of the statute. And for the reasons discussed above, we conclude thatthe policy considerations of the common law as they are
embodied in the zone of danger test best accord with theconcerns that have motivated our FELA jurisprudence.

distress brought under FELA, we reverse the judgmentsbelow. In

Gottshall, we remand for reconsideration under
the zone of danger test announced today. Gottshall assertsbefore this Court that he would in fact meet the requirements of the zone of danger test, while Conrail disagrees.
The question was not adequately briefed or argued beforeus, however, and we believe it best to allow the Third Circuit

to consider the question in the first instance in light of rele-vant common-law precedent.

In Carlisle, however, we remand with instructions to enterjudgment for Conrail. Carlisle's work-stress-related claim
plainly does not fall within the common law's conception ofthe zone of danger, and Carlisle makes no argument that it
does. Without any support in the common law for such a
claim, we will not take the radical step of reading FELA
as compensating for stress arising in the ordinary course of
employment. In short, the core of Carlisle's complaint was
that he "had been given too much--not too dangerous--work
to do. That is not our idea of an FELA claim." Lancaster,
supra, at 813.

The judgments of the Court of Appeals are reversed, and
the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.

So ordered.

Justice Souter, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion holding that claims for negligent
infliction of emotional distress are cognizable under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), and that the zone of
danger test is the appropriate rule for determining liability
for such claims. I write separately to make explicit what I
believe the Court's duty to be in interpreting FELA. That
duty is to develop a federal common law of negligence under
FELA, informed by reference to the evolving common law.
See Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Buell, 480 U. S. 557, 568-
570 (1987). As we have explained:

"[I]nstead of a detailed statute codifying common-lawprinciples, Congress saw fit to enact a statute of the

most general terms, thus leaving in large measure tothe courts the duty of fashioning remedies for injured
employees in a manner analogous to the development oftort remedies at common law. But it is clear that the
general congressional intent was to provide liberal re-covery for injured workers . . . and it is also clear that
Congress intended the creation of no static remedy, butone which would be developed and enlarged to meet
changing conditions and changing concepts of industry'sduty toward its workers."

Kernan v. American Dredging Co., 355 U. S. 426, 432 (1958).

Because I believe the Court's decision today to be a faithfulexercise of that duty, and because there can be no question

that adoption of the zone of danger test is well within thediscretion left to the federal courts under FELA, I join in
its opinion.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Blackmun and
Justice Stevens join, dissenting.

The Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA or Act), 45U. S. C. $ 51

et seq., instructs interstate railroads " `to usereasonable care in furnishing [their] employees with a safe

place to work.' " Ante, at 550, quoting Atchison, T. & S. F.
R. Co. v. Buell, 480 U. S. 557, 558 (1987). As the Court todayrecognizes, the FELA-imposed obligation encompasses "a

duty . . . to avoid subjecting [railroad] workers to negligentlyinflicted emotional injury." Ante, at 550.

The Court limits the scope of the railroad's liability, how-ever, by selecting one of the various "tests" state courts have
applied to restrict recovery by members of the public fornegligently inflicted emotional distress. The Court derives
its limitation largely from a concern, often expressed in statecourt opinions, about the prospect of "infinite liability" to
an "infinite number of persons." See ante, at 552. This

concern should not control in the context of the FELA, as Isee it, for the class of potential plaintiffs under the FELA is

not the public at large; the Act covers only railroad workerswho sustain injuries on the job. In view of the broad language of the Act,1 and this Court's repeated reminders thatthe FELA is to be liberally construed, I cannot regard as
faithful to the legislation and our case law under it the re-strictive test announced in the Court's opinion.

I
The FELA was designed to provide a federal "statutorynegligence action . . . significantly different from the ordinary common-law negligence action." Rogers v. Missouri
Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500, 509-510 (1957). An "avoweddeparture" from prevailing common-law rules, Sinkler v.

Missouri Pacific R. Co., 356 U. S. 326, 329 (1958), the Actadvanced twin purposes: "to eliminate a number of traditional defenses to tort liability and to facilitate recovery inmeritorious cases."

Buell, supra, at 561.2 "Congress in-tended the creation of no static remedy, but one which would

be developed and enlarged to meet changing conditions andchanging concepts of industry's duty toward its workers."
Kernan v. American Dredging Co., 355 U. S. 426, 432 (1958).Relying upon "the breadth of the statutory language, [and]
the Act's humanitarian purposes," this Court has accordedthe FELA a notably "liberal construction in order to accom1 Section 1 of the FELA provides, in relevant part, that "[e]very common carrier by railroad . . . shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier . . .

results] in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers,
agents, or employees of such carrier." 45 U. S. C. $ 51.

2 The FELA, as enacted in 1908, abolished the employer's "fellow servant" defense and provided that an employee's negligence would not bar,
but only reduce, recovery; the Act further prohibited employers from exempting themselves contractually from statutory liability. $$ 51, 53, 55.
As amended in 1939, the Act also abolished the employer's assumption of
risk defense. $ 54.

plish [Congress'] objects." Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S. 163,
180 (1949); see Buell, supra, at 562.

In particular, the Court has given full scope to the key
statutory term "injury." The Act prescribes that "[e]very
common carrier by railroad . . . shall be liable in damages to
any person suffering injury while he is employed by such
carrier." 45 U. S. C. $ 51. That prescription, this Court observed, is "not restrictive as to . . . the particular kind of
injury." Urie, 337 U. S., at 181. "[W]hen the statute was
enacted," it is true, "Congress' attention was focused primarily upon . . . accidents on interstate railroads," for "these
were the major causes of injury and death resulting from
railroad operations." Ibid. But "accidental injuries were
not the only ones likely to occur," and Congress chose "allinclusive wording." Ibid. "To read into [language as broad
as could be framed] a restriction [tied] to . . . the particular
sorts of harms inflicted," the Court recognized, "would be
contradictory to the wording, the remedial and humanitarian
purpose, and the constant and established course of liberal
construction of the Act followed by this Court." Id., at
181-182.

II

Seven years ago, in Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Buell,
480 U. S. 557 (1987), the Court left unresolved the question
whether emotional injury is compensable under the FELA,
because the record in that case did not adequately present
the issue. Id., at 560-561, 570-571. In his unanimous opinion for the Court, Justice Stevens explained why the question could not be resolved on a fact-thin record:

"[W]hether `emotional injury' is cognizable under the
FELA is not necessarily an abstract point of law or a
pure question of statutory construction that might be
answerable without exacting scrutiny of the facts of the
case. Assuming, as we have, that FELA jurisprudence
gleans guidance from common-law developments, see

Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S., at 174, whether one canrecover for emotional injury might rest on a variety of

subtle and intricate distinctions related to the nature ofthe injury and the character of the tortious activity."
Id., at 568.. . . . .
"[T]he question whether one can recover for emotional
injury may not be susceptible to an all-inclusive `yes' or`no' answer. As in other areas of law, broad pronouncements in this area may have to bow to the precise appli-cation of developing legal principles to the particular
facts at hand." Id., at 570.
In deciding the cases now under review, the Court of Appeals endeavored to " `field the Buell pitch.' " 988 F. 2d 355,365 (CA3 1993), quoting

Plaisance v. Texaco, Inc., 937 F. 2d
1004, 1009 (CA5 1991). A

In respondent Gottshall's case, the Court of Appeals firstdescribed the various rules state courts have applied to
common-law actions for negligent infliction of emotional dis-tress. 988 F. 2d, at 361-362. That court emphasized, however, that "[d]etermining FELA liability is distinctly a fed-eral question."

Id., at 362. State common-law decisions,
the Court of Appeals observed, "do not necessarily etch the
contours of the federal right," ibid., for the common law thatcourts develop to fill the FELA's interstices is "federal" in

character. See id., at 367.In addition to the FELA's express abolition of traditional
employer defenses, the Court of Appeals next noted, this
Court's decisions interpreting the FELA served as pathmarkers. The Court of Appeals referred to decisions that
had relaxed "the strict requirements of causation in common
law," id., at 368, citing Rogers, 352 U. S., at 506, broadened
the conception of negligence per se, see 988 F. 2d, at 368,
citing Kernan, 355 U. S., at 437-439, and generously con512us2$86P 01-08-98 12:38:17 PAGES OPINPGT

strued the FELA's injury requirement, 988 F. 2d, at 368,citing Urie, 337 U. S., at 181-182. The FELA, the Court of

Appeals concluded:

"imposes upon carriers a higher standard of conduct andhas eliminated many of the refined distinctions and restrictions that common law imposed to bar recovery(even on meritorious claims). FELA liability and common law liability are thus different." 988 F. 2d, at 369.
Accordingly, the Court of Appeals "refused to designate aparticular common law test as

the test" applicable in FELAcases. Id., at 365. Instead, the court looked to the purposes of those tests: to distinguish "the meritorious [claim]from the feigned and frivolous," id., at 369, and to assure
that liability for negligently inflicted emotional distress doesnot expand "into the `fantastic realm of infinite liability.' "
Id., at 372, quoting Amaya v. Home Ice, Fuel & Supply Co.,59 Cal. 2d 295, 315, 379 P. 2d 513, 525 (1963); see also 988 F.
2d, at 381-382.FELA jurisprudence, the Court of Appeals reasoned,
has evolved not through a "rules first" approach, but in thetraditional, fact-bound, case-by-case common-law way. See

id., at 371. The court therefore undertook to determine"whether the factual circumstances [in Gottshall's case] provide a threshold assurance that there is a likelihood of genu-ine and serious emotional injury." Ibid. "[O]ne consideration" in that inquiry, the court said, "is whether plaintiff hasa `solid basis in the present state of common law to permit
him to recover.' " Ibid., quoting Outten v. National Rail-road Passenger Corp., 928 F. 2d 74, 79 (CA3 1991).

Gottshall's claim, the Court of Appeals held, presented therequisite "threshold assurance." His emotional distress, diagnosed by three doctors as major depression and posttrau-matic stress disorder, 988 F. 2d, at 374, was unquestionably
genuine and severe: He was institutionalized for threeweeks, followed by continuing outpatient care; he lost 40
pounds; and he suffered from "suicidal preoccupations, anxi512us2$86P 01-08-98 12:38:17 PAGES OPINPGT

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
ety, sleep onset insomnia, cold sweats, . . . nausea, physicalweakness, repetitive nightmares and a fear of leaving home."

Ibid.; see also id., at 373 (noting that Conrail "wisely de-clined" to attack Gottshall's claim as fraudulent). Gottshall's afflictions, the Court of Appeals observed, satisfied
the "physical manifestation" limitation that some States, andthe Second Restatement of Torts, place on emotional distress

recovery. See id., at 373-374 (citing cases); Restatement(Second) of Torts $ 436A (1965) (no liability for emotional distress without "bodily harm or other compensable damage");
ibid., Comment c ("[L]ong continued nausea or headaches
may amount to physical illness, which is bodily harm; . . .
long continued mental disturbance . . . may be classified by
the courts as illness" and thus be compensable). Cf. Buell,
480 U. S., at 570, n. 22 (suggesting a distinction between
claims for "pure emotional injury" and those involving "physical symptoms in addition to . . . severe psychological
illness").

The Court of Appeals also inspected the facts under the
"bystande[r]" test, versions of which have been adopted by
nearly half the States. See ante, at 549. While acknowledging that Gottshall did not satisfy the more restrictive
versions of the "bystander" test, the court observed that
several States have allowed recovery even where, as here,
the plaintiff and the victim of physical injury were unrelated
by blood or marriage. See 988 F. 2d, at 371 (citing cases).
Further, the court noted, given "the reality of the railway
industry," rarely will one "se[e] another family member injured while working in the railroad yard." Id., at 372. A
strict version of the bystander rule, therefore, would operate
not to limit recovery to the most meritorious cases, but almost to preclude bystander recovery altogether.

To adapt the bystander rule to the FELA context, the
court looked to the reasons for limiting bystander recovery:
to avoid compensating plaintiffs with fraudulent or trivial
claims, and to prevent liability from becoming "an intolerable

burden upon society." Id., at 369, 372. The court held thatneither concern barred recovery in Gottshall's case. The

genuineness of Gottshall's claim appeared not just in themanifestations of his distress, the court said, but also in the
extraordinarily close, 15-year friendship between Gottshall
and Johns, the decedent. Id., at 371. Liability to bystand-ers, the court concluded, would be far less burdensome in the

FELA context, where only close co-workers are potentialplaintiffs, than in the context of a common-law rule applicable to society as a whole. Id., at 372. In this regard, theCourt of Appeals again recalled, this Court has constantly
admonished lower courts that "recovery [under the FELA]
should be liberally granted," ibid., "so that the remedial and
humanitarian goals of the statute can be fully implemented,"
id., at 373.

Satisfied that Gottshall had crossed the "genuine and
severe" injury threshold, the Court of Appeals inquired
whether he had a triable case on breach of duty and causation. Id., at 374. Here, the court emphasized that Gottshall's distress was attributable not to "the ordinary stress
of the job," id., at 375, but instead, to Conrail's decision to
send a crew of men, most of them 50 to 60 years old and
many of them overweight, out into 97-degree heat at high
noon, in a remote, sun-baked location, requiring them to replace heavy steel rails at an extraordinarily fast pace without
breaks, and without maintaining radio contact or taking any
other precautions to protect the men's safety, id., at 376-377.

The Court of Appeals stated, further, that even if Conrail
could be said to have acted reasonably up to the time of
Johns' death, "its conduct after the death raises an issue of
whether it breached a legal duty." Id., at 378. The Conrail
supervisor required the crew to return to work immediately
after Johns' corpse was laid by the side of the road, covered
but still in view. Ibid. The next day, Gottshall alleged, the
supervisor "reprimanded him for administering CPR to
Johns," id., at 359, then pushed the crew even harder under

the same conditions, requiring a full day, plus three or fourhours of overtime, id., at 378. These circumstances, the

Court of Appeals concluded, "created not only physical haz-ards, but constituted emotional hazards which can equally
debilitate and scar an employee, particularly one who hadjust witnessed a friend die under the same conditions."

Id.,at 378.

B
Upholding a jury verdict for plaintiff in Carlisle, the Courtof Appeals "reaffirm[ed]" its

Gottshall holding that "no sin-gle common law standard" governs in "weighing the genuineness of emotional injury claims." Instead, the courtsaid:

"[C]ourts . . . should engage in an initial review of thefactual indicia of the genuineness of a claim, taking into
account broadly used common law standards, thenshould apply the traditional negligence elements of duty,
foreseeability, breach, and causation in weighing themerits of that claim." 990 F. 2d 90, 98 (CA3 1993).

The Court of Appeals held that the evidence submitted tothe jury amply established the claim's genuineness. Carlisle
testified that, after Conrail's 1984 reduction in force, thepressure on train dispatchers in Philadelphia, already substantial, increased dramatically. As the person chiefly re-sponsible for ensuring the safety of "trains carrying passengers, freight and hazardous materials," Carlisle became"increasingly anxious" over the sharp reduction in staff, together with the outdated equipment and "Conrail's repeatedinstructions to ignore safety concerns, such as malfunctioning equipment or poor maintenance." Id., at 92. WhenCarlisle was compelled to work 12- to 15-hour shifts for 15
consecutive days, the resulting additional pressures, and thedifficulty of working for "an abusive, alcoholic supervisor,"
led, according to Carlisle's expert witness, to the nervousbreakdown he suffered. Ibid.

567Cite as: 512 U. S. 532 (1994)
Ginsburg, J., dissenting
Other evidence confirmed Carlisle's testimony. Deposi-tions taken from "Carlisle's co-workers and subordinates"

averred that "their jobs as dispatchers and supervisors inthe Philadelphia Conrail offices had caused them to suffer
cardiac arrests, nervous breakdowns, and a variety of emo-tional problems such as depression, paranoia and insomnia."
Ibid. An official report prepared by the Federal RailwayAdministration "criticized the outdated equipment and hazardous working conditions at Conrail's Philadelphia dispatch-ing office."

Id., at 93. Furthermore, the Court of Appealspointed out, Carlisle's emotional injury was "accompanied by

obvious physical manifestations": "insomnia, fatigue, head-aches, . . . sleepwalking and substantial weight-loss."

Id.,at 97, n. 11, 92. The court specifically noted: "We do not

face and do not decide the issue of whether purely emotionalinjury, caused by extended exposure to stressful, dangerous working conditions, would be compensable under theFELA." Id., at 97, n. 11.

Satisfied that the jury could indeed find Carlisle's injurygenuine, and continuing to follow the path it had marked in
Gottshall, the court next examined the negligence elementsof Carlisle's claim. Emphasizing that "Conrail had ample
notice of the stressful and dangerous conditions under whichCarlisle was forced to work," including actual notice of physical and emotional injuries sustained by Carlisle's co-workers,990 F. 2d, at 97, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District
Court's denial of Conrail's motions for judgment n.o.v. or inthe alternative for a new trial. Carlisle's "extended exposure to dangerous and stressful working conditions," thecourt concluded, constituted a breach of Conrail's duty to
provide a safe workplace, and the breach caused Carlisle'sinjuries. Id., at 97-98.

III
The Court initially "agree[s] with the Third Circuit thatclaims for damages for negligent infliction of emotional

distress are cognizable under FELA." Ante, at 549-550.

512us2$86P 01-08-98 12:38:18 PAGES OPINPGT
568 CONSOLIDATED RAIL CORPORATION v. GOTTSHALL

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
This conclusion, "an easy one" for the Court, ante, at 550, isinformed by prior decisions giving full scope to the FELA's

term "injury." The Court had explained in Urie that an oc-cupational disease incurred in the course of employment--
silicosis in that particular case--is as much "injury . . . as
scalding from a boiler's explosion." 337 U. S., at 187. Re-jecting a reading of the statute that would confine coverage to "accidental injury" of the kind that particularlyprompted the 1908 Congress to enact the FELA, the Court
said of the occupational disease at issue:

"[W]hen the employer's negligence impairs or destroys
an employee's health by requiring him to work underconditions likely to bring about such harmful consequences, the injury to the employee is just as greatwhen it follows, often inevitably, from a carrier's negligent course pursued over an extended period of time aswhen it comes with the suddenness of lightning."

Id.,
at 186-187.

Similarly, as the Court recognizes today, " `severe emotional
injuries can be just as debilitating as physical injuries,' "hence there is "no reason why emotional injury should not

be held to be encompassed within th[e] term [`injury']."
Ante, at 550, quoting Gottshall, 988 F. 2d, at 361.

In my view, the Court of Appeals correctly determined
that Gottshall's submissions should survive Conrail's motionfor summary judgment, and that the jury's verdict in favor

of Carlisle should stand. Both workers suffered severe in-jury on the job, and plausibly tied their afflictions to Conrail's
negligence. Both experienced not just emotional, but also
physical, distress: Gottshall lost 40 pounds and suffered from
insomnia, physical weakness, and cold sweats, while Carlisle
experienced "insomnia, fatigue, headaches, . . . sleepwalking
and substantial weight-loss." Id., at 374; 990 F. 2d, at 92,
97, n. 11. The Court emphasizes the "significant role" that
"common-law principles must play." Ante, at 544. Notably

569Cite as: 512 U. S. 532 (1994)
Ginsburg, J., dissenting
in that regard, both Gottshall and Carlisle satisfy the "physical manifestation" test endorsed by the Restatement of
Torts. See supra, at 564, 567; see also W. Keeton, D. Dobbs,
R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts
364 (5th ed. 1984) ("the great majority of courts have now
repudiated the requirement of `impact,' regarding as sufficient the requirement that the mental distress be certified
by some physical injury, illness or other objective physical
manifestation"); id., at 364, n. 55 (citing cases). Thus, without gainsaying that "FELA jurisprudence gleans guidance
from common-law developments," Buell, 480 U. S., at 568,
one can readily conclude that both Gottshall and Carlisle
have made sufficient showings of "injuries" compensable
under the FELA.3

Notwithstanding its recognition that the word "injury," as
used in the FELA, "may encompass both physical and emotional injury," the Court elects to render compensable only
emotional distress stemming from a worker's placement in
the "zone of danger." Ante, at 556. In other words, to recover for emotional distress, the railroad employee must
show that negligence attributable to his employer threatened him "imminently with physical impact." Ibid. Based
on the "zone" test, the Court reverses the judgment for
Carlisle outright and remands Gottshall's case for reconsideration under that standard. Ante, at 557-558.

The Court offers three justifications for its adoption of the
"zone of danger" test. First, the Court suggests that the
"zone" test is most firmly rooted in "the common law." The
Court mentions that several jurisdictions had adopted the
zone of danger test by 1908, ante, at 546, 547, n. 8 (citing cases
from eight States), and that the test "currently is followed
in 14 jurisdictions." Ante, at 548. But that very exposition

3 The Gottshall and Carlisle cases do not call for decision of the question
whether physical manifestations would be necessary for recovery in
every case.

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
tells us that the "zone" test never held sway in a majorityof States.

Moreover, the Court never decides firmly on the point ofreference, present or historical, from which to evaluate the
relative support the different common-law rules have enjoyed. If the Court regarded as decisive the degree of sup-port a rule currently enjoys among state courts, the Court

would allow bystander recovery, permitted in some form in"nearly half the States."

Ante, at 549. But cf. ante, at 556
(bystander rule "was not developed until 60 years afterFELA's enactment, and therefore lacks historical support").

If, on the other hand, the Court decided that historical sup-port carried the day, then the impact rule, preferred by most
jurisdictions in 1908, would be the Court's choice. But cf.
ibid. (preferring the zone of danger test to the impact rule,because,

inter alia, the latter "has considerably less support
in the current state of the common law" than the former).The Court further maintains that the zone of danger test

is preferable because it is "consistent with FELA's centralfocus on physical perils."

Ante, at 555. But, as already underscored, see supra, at 561, the FELA's language "is asbroad as could be framed . . . . On its face, every injury suffered [on the job] by any employee . . . by reason of the carrier's negligence was made compensable." Urie, 337 U. S.,
at 181. And the FELA's strikingly broad language, characteristically, "has been construed even more broadly," in line
with Congress' dominant remedial objective. Buell, 480
U. S., at 562; Urie, supra, at 181 ("[N]othing in either the
language or the legislative history discloses expressly any
intent to exclude from the Act's coverage any injury resulting `in whole or in part from the negligence' of the carrier").

The Court's principal reason for restricting the FELA's
coverage of emotional distress claims is its fear of "infinite
liability" to an "infinite number of persons." See ante, at
552; see also ante, at 557 (referring to "the specter of unlimited and unpredictable liability," and stating that "the fear
of unlimited liability . . . [is] well founded"). The universe

of potential FELA plaintiffs, however, is hardly "infinite."The statute does not govern the public at large. Only persons "suffering injury . . . while employed" by a railroad mayrecover under the FELA, and to do so, the complainant must
show that the injury resulted from the railroad's negligence.45 U. S. C. $ 51. The Court expresses concern that the
approach Gottshall and Carlisle advocate would require"[ j]udges . . . to make highly subjective determinations concerning the authenticity of claims for emotional injury, whichare far less susceptible to objective medical proof than are
their physical counterparts." Ante, at 552. One solution tothis problem--a solution the Court does not explore--would
be to require such "objective medical proof " and to exclude,as too insubstantial to count as "injury," claims lacking this
proof. IV

While recognizing today that emotional distress may qual-ify as an "injury" compensable under the FELA, the Court
rejects the Court of Appeals' thoughtfully developed andcomprehensively explained approach as "inconsistent with
the principles embodied in the statute and with relevantcommon-law doctrine."

Ante, at 535. The Court's formu-lation, requiring consistency with both the FELA and

"common-law doctrine," is odd, for there is no unitary com-mon law governing claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress.4 The "common law" of emotional distress

4 Throughout its opinion, the Court invokes "the common law" in the
singular. See, e. g., ante, at 551 ("The common law must inform the availability of a right to recover under FELA"); ante, at 552 ("The common
law consistently has sought to place limits on . . . potential liability"); ante,
at 554 ("[T]he common law in 1908 did not allow [prejudgment] interest");
ante, at 557 ("[T]he common law restricts recovery"); ante, at 558 ("Carlisle's . . . claim plainly does not fall within the common law's conception
of the zone of danger"). But see Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 244 U. S.
205, 222 (1917) (Holmes, J., dissenting) ("The common law is not a brooding
omnipresence in the sky but the articulate voice of some sovereign or
quasi-sovereign that can be identified . . . . It always is the law of some
State . . . .").

exists not in the singular, but emphatically in the plural; andwhile the rule the Court has selected is consistent with one

common-law rule that some States have adopted, it is inevi-tably inconsistent with others.

Most critically, the Court selects a common-law rule per-haps appropriate were the task to choose a law governing
the generality of federal tort claims. The "zone" rule theCourt selects, however, seems to me inappropriate for a
federal statute designed to govern the discrete category ofon-the-job injuries sustained by railroad workers. In that
domain our charge from Congress is to fashion remedies con-stantly "liberal," and appropriately "enlarged to meet changing conditions and changing concepts of industry's dutytoward its workers." Kernan v. American Dredging Co.,
355 U. S., at 432. The Court's choice does not fit that bill.Instead of the restrictive "zone" test that leaves severely
harmed workers remediless, however negligent their em-ployers, the appropriate FELA claim threshold should be
keyed to the genuineness and gravity of the worker's injury.In my view, the Court of Appeals developed the appropriate FELA common-law approach and correctly appliedthat approach in these cases. I would therefore affirm the
Court of Appeals' judgments.

573OCTOBER TERM, 1993
Syllabus

SHANNON v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 92-8346. Argued March 22, 1994--Decided June 24, 1994
In the Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984 (IDRA or Act), Congress

made insanity an affirmative defense, created a special verdict of "not
guilty only by reason of insanity" (NGI), and established a comprehensive civil commitment procedure. At his trial on a federal criminal
charge, petitioner Shannon raised the insanity defense and asked the
District Court to instruct the jury that an NGI verdict would result in
his involuntary commitment. The court refused, and the jury returned
a guilty verdict. In affirming, the Court of Appeals noted that, under
its pre-IDRA precedent, juries were not to be instructed concerning the
consequences of an insanity acquittal. Because there was no directive
in the IDRA to the contrary, the court "adhere[d] to the established
axiom that it is inappropriate for a jury to consider or be informed about
the consequences of its verdict."

Held: A federal district court is not required to instruct the jury regarding the consequences to the defendant of an NGI verdict. Pp. 579-588.

(a) The principle that juries are not to consider the consequences of
their verdicts is a reflection of the basic division of labor between the
judge as sentencer and the jury as trier of fact. Providing jurors sentencing information invites them to ponder matters that are not within
their province, distracts them from their responsibilities, and creates a
strong possibility of confusion. Pp. 579-580.

(b) The IDRA does not require courts to depart from the foregoing
principle. The text of the Act gives no indication that jurors are to be
instructed regarding the consequences of an NGI verdict. The Court
rejects Shannon's contention that Congress, by modeling the IDRA on
D. C. Code Ann. $ 24-301, impliedly adopted a D. C. Circuit decision that
endorsed the practice of giving the instruction in question in the context
of $ 24-301. Because Congress departed from the scheme embodied in

$ 24-301 in several significant ways when it passed the IDRA, the canon
of construction urged by Shannon--that adoption of the wording of a
statute from another legislative jurisdiction carries with it the jurisdiction's judicial interpretations of that wording--is not applicable. The
single passage in the legislative history endorsing the giving of the
instruction in question is in no way anchored in the IDRA's text and
is not entitled to authoritative weight. Pp. 580-584.

574 SHANNON v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
(c) The instruction in question is not required as a matter of general
federal criminal practice. Even if Shannon is correct that some jurors
may harbor the mistaken belief that defendants found NGI will be released into society immediately, it must be assumed that his jury followed its instructions to apply the law regardless of the consequences
and not to consider or discuss punishment. See Richardson v. Marsh,
481 U. S. 200, 206. Also unpersuasive is Shannon's contention that the
instruction would allay the fears of such misinformed jurors. Indeed,
because the only mandatory period of confinement under the IDRA is a
maximum of 40 days between an NGI verdict and a required commitment hearing, an instruction of the type at issue might incline jurors to
convict in order to eliminate the possibility that a dangerous defendant
could be released after 40 days or less. In any event, the instruction
would draw the jury's attention to the very thing--the possible consequences of its verdict--that it should ignore. Moreover, Shannon offers
no principled way to limit the availability of such instructions to cases
involving NGI verdicts, as opposed to the many other aspects of the
criminal sentencing process with which jurors may be unfamiliar.
Given the comprehensive nature of Congress' review of the insanity defense during the enactment of the IDRA, the Court will not invoke its
supervisory powers to require an instruction that Congress chose not
to mandate. Pp. 584-587.

(d) This decision should not be misunderstood as an absolute prohibition on instructing the jury with regard to the consequences of an NGI
verdict. An instruction of some form may be necessary under certain
limited circumstances to remedy a misstatement or error. That is not
the case here, however, for there is no indication that any improper
statement was made in the presence of the jury during Shannon's
trial. Pp. 587-588.

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this case, we consider whether a federal district courtis required to instruct the jury regarding the consequences

to the defendant of a verdict of "not guilty by reason of in-sanity," either under the Insanity Defense Reform Act of
1984 or as a matter of general federal practice. We concludethat such an instruction is not required, and therefore affirm.

I
A

Prior to the enactment of the Insanity Defense ReformAct of 1984 (IDRA or Act), 18 U. S. C. $$ 17, 4241-4247,

federal courts generally did not recognize a verdict of"not guilty by reason of insanity" (NGI). Defendants who
mounted a successful insanity defense--that is, those whoraised a reasonable doubt as to their sanity at the time of the
offense--were simply found "not guilty." See, e. g., United
States v. McCracken, 488 F. 2d 406, 409, 418 (CA5 1974);Evalt v. United States, 359 F. 2d 534, 537 (CA9 1966). In

addition, there was no general federal civil commitment pro-cedure available to ensure that an insanity acquittee would
receive proper care and treatment. Only in the District ofColumbia was a defendant who successfully presented an insanity defense to a federal criminal charge subject to a fed-eral commitment process--a process governed by a 1955 congressional enactment. See 69 Stat. 609, as amended, D. C.Code Ann. $ 24-301 (1981).

Opinion of the Court
were forced to rely on the willingness of state authorities toinstitute civil commitment proceedings. Reliance on state

cooperation was "at best a partial solution to a serious prob-lem," however, and federal courts "[t]ime and again . . . decried this gaping statutory hole." McCracken, supra, at
417.Before the IDRA was enacted, the Federal Courts of Appeals generally disapproved of instructing the jury concern-ing the post-trial consequences of an insanity acquittal.
Thus, jurors typically were given no information with regardto what would happen to a defendant acquitted by reason of
insanity. The courts in general gave two reasons for disapproving such instructions. First, they pointed out that,
given the absence of a federal commitment procedure, the
consequences of an insanity acquittal were far from certain.
Second, they concluded that such instructions would run
afoul of the well-established principle that a jury is to base
its verdict on the evidence before it, without regard to the
possible consequences of the verdict. See, e. g., McCracken,
supra, at 423; Evalt, supra, at 546; United States v. Borum,
464 F. 2d 896, 900-901 (CA10 1972).

The only Court of Appeals to endorse the practice of instructing the jury regarding the consequences of an insanity
acquittal was the District of Columbia Circuit. See Lyles v.
United States, 254 F. 2d 725 (1957) (en banc), cert. denied, 356
U. S. 961 (1958). In Lyles, the District of Columbia Circuit
addressed the jury instruction question in the context of
D. C. Code Ann. $ 24-301 (1951 ed., Supp. V), which, unlike
generally applicable federal law, provided for a special verdict of NGI and, as noted above, a civil commitment procedure. The Lyles court recognized the "well established and
sound" doctrine "that the jury has no concern with the consequences" of a verdict, but stated that the doctrine "d[id]
not apply" to the situation before it. 254 F. 2d, at 728. According to the court, although jurors generally were "aware
of the meanings of verdicts of guilty and not guilty," they

were unfamiliar with the meaning of an NGI verdict. Ibid.The court concluded that jurors had "a right to know" the

meaning of an NGI verdict "as accurately as [they] kno[w] bycommon knowledge the meaning of the other two possible
verdicts." Ibid.The acquittal of John Hinckley on all charges stemming
from his attempt on President Reagan's life, coupled withthe ensuing public focus on the insanity defense, prompted
Congress to undertake a comprehensive overhaul of the in-sanity defense as it operated in the federal courts. The result of this effort was the IDRA. In the IDRA, Congressmade insanity an affirmative defense to be proved by the
defendant by clear and convincing evidence, and created aspecial verdict of "not guilty only by reason of insanity." 18
U. S. C. $$ 17 and 4242(b). In addition, Congress filled the"statutory hole" that had been identified by federal courts,
see McCracken, supra, by creating a comprehensive civilcommitment procedure. $ 4243. Under that procedure, a
defendant found NGI is held in custody pending a courthearing, which must occur within 40 days of the verdict.

$ 4243(c). At the conclusion of the hearing, the court de-termines whether the defendant should be hospitalized or
released. $$ 4243(d), (e). B

At about 4 a.m. on August 25, 1990, a police officer stoppedpetitioner Terry Lee Shannon, a convicted felon, on a street
in Tupelo, Mississippi. For reasons not explained in the rec-ord before us, the officer asked Shannon to accompany him
to the station house to speak with a detective. After tellingthe officer that he did not want to live anymore, Shannon
walked across the street, pulled a pistol from his coat, andshot himself in the chest.

Shannon survived his suicide attempt and was indicted forunlawful possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of 18
U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1). At trial, he raised the insanity defense,and asked the District Court to instruct the jury that he

Opinion of the Court
would be involuntarily committed if the jury returned anNGI verdict.

2 The District Court refused to give Shannon's

proposed charge. Instead, it instructed the jury "to applythe law as [instructed] regardless of the consequence," and

that "punishment . . . should not enter your consideration
or discussion." App. A-27 to A-28. The jury returned aguilty verdict.

The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed Shan-non's conviction. 981 F. 2d 759 (1993). The court noted
that under its pre-IDRA precedent, juries were not to beinstructed concerning the consequences of an insanity acquittal. Id., at 761-762 (discussing United States v. McCracken,488 F. 2d 406 (CA5 1974)). Turning to the text of the IDRA,
the court observed that Congress had "said nothing about
informing juries of the consequences" of an NGI verdict.981 F. 2d, at 764. Because there was no "statutory requirement" to the contrary, the court "adhere[d] to the established
axiom that it is inappropriate for a jury to consider or be
informed about the consequences of its verdict." Ibid.3

2 Shannon asked the court to give either of the two following instructions: (1) " `In the event it is your verdict that [Shannon] is not guilty only
by reason of insanity, it is required that the Court commit [him]' "; or (2)
" `[Y]ou should know that it is required that the Court commit [Shannon]
to a suitable hospital facility until such time as [he] does not pose a substantial risk of bodily injury to another or serious damage to the property
of another.' " App. A-22.

3 In addition to the court below, the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits recently have reaffirmed their pre-IDRA holdings that juries generally
should not be instructed concerning the consequences of an insanity acquittal. See United States v. Frank, 956 F. 2d 872, 880-882 (CA9 1991),
cert. denied, 506 U. S. 932 (1992); Thigpen, 4 F. 3d, at 1578. The Third
Circuit has held that the decision to give such an instruction should be
left to "the sound discretion of the trial judge." United States v. Fisher,
10 F. 3d 115, 122 (1993), cert. pending, No. 93-7000. A panel of the Second
Circuit recently divided three ways on the issue. See United States v.
Blume, 967 F. 2d 45, 50 (1992) (Newman, J., concurring) ("I believe the
instruction should always be given unless the defendant prefers its
omission. Judge Winter believes the instruction should normally not be

Opinion of the Court
We granted certiorari, 510 U. S. 943 (1993), in order to con-sider whether federal district courts are required to instruct

juries with regard to the consequences of an NGI verdict.

II
It is well established that when a jury has no sentencingfunction,

4 it should be admonished to "reach its verdict without regard to what sentence might be imposed." Rogers v.United States, 422 U. S. 35, 40 (1975).

5 The principle that

juries are not to consider the consequences of their verdictsis a reflection of the basic division of labor in our legal system

between judge and jury. The jury's function is to find thefacts and to decide whether, on those facts, the defendant is
guilty of the crime charged. The judge, by contrast, im-poses sentence on the defendant after the jury has arrived
at a guilty verdict. Information regarding the consequencesof a verdict is therefore irrelevant to the jury's task. Moreover, providing jurors sentencing information invites themto ponder matters that are not within their province, distracts them from their factfinding responsibilities, and cre-ates a strong possibility of confusion. See

Pope v. United
States, 298 F. 2d 507, 508 (CA5 1962); cf. Rogers, supra, at 40.Despite these familiar precepts, Shannon contends that an

instruction informing the jury of the consequences of an NGI

given. Judge Lumbard believes that the decision whether to give the
instruction should be left to the discretion of the trial judge").

4 Particularly in capital trials, juries may be given sentencing responsibilities. See, e. g., Simmons v. South Carolina, ante, p. 154. It is undisputed that the jury had no such responsibilities in Shannon's case.

5 In Rogers, the jury had been deliberating for almost two hours without

reaching a verdict. After the trial court informed the jury that it would
accept a verdict of "Guilty as charged with extreme mercy of the Court,"
the jury returned such a verdict within minutes. 422 U. S., at 36-37 (internal quotation marks omitted). We concluded that, instead of giving
the jurors information about sentencing (that is, that they could recommend "extreme mercy"), the trial court should have "admoni[shed] [them]
that [they] had no sentencing function and should reach [their] verdict
without regard to what sentence might be imposed." Id., at 40.

580 SHANNON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
verdict is required under the IDRA whenever requested bythe defendant. He also argues that such an instruction is

required as a matter of general federal criminal practice.We address each argument in turn.

A
To determine whether Congress intended courts to departfrom the principle that jurors are not to be informed of the

consequences of their verdicts, we turn first, as always, tothe text of the statute. The IDRA refers to the subject of
jury instructions only once, and that reference occurs in itsdescription of the possible verdicts a jury may return.
Under the Act, "the jury shall be instructed to find . . . thedefendant--(1) guilty; (2) not guilty; or (3) not guilty only by
reason of insanity." 18 U. S. C. $ 4242(b). The text of theAct gives no indication that jurors are to be instructed regarding the consequences of an NGI verdict. As the courtbelow observed, the Act "leaves the jury solely with its customary determination of guilt or innocence." 981 F. 2d, at763. The Act's text thus gives no support to Shannon's contention that an instruction informing the jury of the conse-quences of an NGI verdict is required.

Shannon asserts, however, that an express statutory direc-tive is not necessary because, by modeling the IDRA on D. C.
Code Ann. $ 24-301 (1981),6 Congress impliedly adopted theDistrict of Columbia Circuit's decision in Lyles and the practice endorsed by that decision of instructing the jury as tothe consequences of an NGI verdict. For this argument he
relies on Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, 174 U. S. 1, 36 (1899),in which we stated:

6 District of Columbia Code Ann. $ 24-301 continued to govern the
operation of the insanity defense in federal criminal prosecutions in the
District of Columbia until the passage of the IDRA. Cf. United States
v. Crutchfield, 893 F. 2d 376, 377-379 (CADC 1990) (holding that the
IDRA applies prospectively to insanity acquittees committed after its
enactment).

581Cite as: 512 U. S. 573 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
"By a familiar canon of interpretation, heretofore ap-plied by this court whenever Congress . . . has borrowed

from the statutes of a State provisions which had re-ceived in that State a known and settled construction
before their enactment by Congress, that constructionmust be deemed to have been adopted by Congress together with the text which it expounded, and the provi-sions must be construed as they were understood at the
time in the State."
See also Carolene Products Co. v. United States, 323 U. S.18, 26 (1944) ("[T]he general rule [is] that adoption of the

wording of a statute from another legislative jurisdiction car-ries with it the previous judicial interpretations of the wording"); Cathcart v. Robinson, 5 Pet. 264, 280 (1831). Thecanon of interpretation upon which Shannon relies, however,
is merely a "presumption of legislative intention" to be in-voked only "under suitable conditions."

Carolene Products,supra, at 26. We believe that the "conditions" are not "suitable" in this case. Indeed, although Congress may have hadthe District of Columbia Code in mind when it passed the
IDRA, see United States v. Crutchfield, 893 F. 2d 376, 378(CADC 1990), it did not, in the language of Hof, "borrow"
the terms of the IDRA from the District of Columbia Code.Rather, Congress departed from the scheme embodied in
D. C. Code Ann. $ 24-301 in several significant ways.The IDRA, for example, requires a defendant at trial to
prove insanity by clear and convincing evidence, 18 U. S. C.$ 17(b); the District of Columbia statute, by contrast, employs
a preponderance standard, D. C. Code Ann. $ 24-301( j). Acommitment hearing must be held under the IDRA within
40 days of an NGI verdict, 18 U. S. C. $ 4243(c); the period is50 days under the District of Columbia scheme, D. C. Code
Ann. $ 24-301(d)(2)(A). Under the IDRA, a defendantwhose offense involved bodily injury to another or serious
damage to another's property, or the substantial risk thereof,must demonstrate at the hearing by clear and convincing evi512us2$87N 01-08-98 12:39:04 PAGES OPINPGT
582 SHANNON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
dence that he is entitled to release, 18 U. S. C. $ 4243(d);under the District of Columbia scheme, an acquittee, regardless of the character of his offense, need only meet the pre-ponderance standard, D. C. Code Ann. $ 24-301(k)(3). The
IDRA provides that an acquittee, once committed, may be
released when he no longer presents a substantial risk ofharm to others or to their property, 18 U. S. C. $ 4243(f); an

acquittee under the District of Columbia system may be re-leased from commitment when he "will not in the reasonable
future be dangerous to himself or others," D. C. Code Ann.$ 24-301(e). Finally, in the IDRA, Congress rejected the
broad test for insanity that had been utilized under the Dis-trict of Columbia provision,

7 and instead adopted a more restrictive formulation under which a person is deemed insaneif he is unable "to appreciate the nature and quality or the

wrongfulness of his acts." 18 U. S. C. $ 17(a). We believethat these significant differences between the IDRA and
D. C. Code Ann. $ 24-301 render the canon upon which Shannon relies inapplicable in this case.8

7 Under the District of Columbia system, the courts had defined insanity
as either the lack of substantial capacity to conform one's conduct to the
requirements of the law or the lack of substantial capacity to appreciate
the wrongfulness of one's acts. See Brawner, 471 F. 2d, at 973-995.

8 In addition, we note that the canon upon which Shannon relies is a

canon of statutory construction. It stems from the notion that a court,
in interpreting "borrowed" statutory language, should apply the same construction to that language that was placed upon it by the courts in the
jurisdiction from which it was borrowed. In this case, however, the court
in the jurisdiction from which the statutory text was supposedly borrowed--that is, the Lyles court--did not purport to construe the language
of the District of Columbia Code provision; rather, in holding that jurors
should be informed of the consequences of an NGI verdict, the court appears to have relied on its supervisory power over the Federal District
Courts in the District of Columbia. Cf. infra, at 584. Thus, we conclude
that the canon is also inapplicable in this case because there was no
"known and settled construction," Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, 174 U. S.
1, 36 (1899), of the statute that Congress could have adopted by virtue of
borrowing language from the District of Columbia statutory scheme.

Opinion of the Court
Alternatively, Shannon contends that a provision explicitlyrequiring the instruction is unnecessary for a different reason: namely, that Congress made its intention to adopt the
Lyles practice crystal clear in the IDRA's legislative history.
In particular, Shannon points to the following statement in
the Senate Report:

"The Committee endorses the procedure used in theDistrict of Columbia whereby the jury, in a case in which

the insanity defense has been raised, may be instructedon the effect of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. If the defendant requests that the instruction not
be given, it is within the discretion of the court whetherto give it or not." S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 240 (1983)

(footnotes omitted).
Members of this Court have expressed differing views regarding the role that legislative history should play in statu-tory interpretation. Compare

County of Washington v.
Gunther, 452 U. S. 161, 182 (1981) (Rehnquist, J., dissent-ing) ("[I]t [is] well settled that the legislative history of a

statute is a useful guide to the intent of Congress"), with
Wisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier, 501 U. S. 597, 617
(1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (legislative his-tory is "unreliable . . . as a genuine indicator of congressional

intent"). We are not aware of any case, however (and Shannon does not bring one to our attention), in which we havegiven authoritative weight to a single passage of legislative

history that is in no way anchored in the text of the statute.On its face, the passage Shannon identifies does not purport
to explain or interpret any provision of the IDRA. Rather,
it merely conveys the Committee's "endorsement" of the
Lyles "procedure"--a procedure that Congress did not include in the text of the Act. To give effect to this snippet
of legislative history, we would have to abandon altogether
the text of the statute as a guide in the interpretative process. We agree with the District of Columbia Circuit that

584 SHANNON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
"courts have no authority to enforce [a] principl[e] gleanedsolely from legislative history that has no statutory reference point." International Brotherhood of Elec. Workers,Local Union No. 474, AFL-CIO v. NLRB, 814 F. 2d 697, 712
(1987) (emphasis deleted). We thus conclude that there isno support in the Act for the instruction Shannon seeks.

9

B
Setting the Act aside, Shannon argues that the instructionhe proposes is required as a matter of general federal criminal practice. Presumably, Shannon asks us to invoke oursupervisory power over the federal courts. According to
Shannon, the instruction is necessary because jurors are gen-erally unfamiliar with the consequences of an NGI verdict,
and may erroneously believe that a defendant who is foundNGI will be immediately released into society. Jurors who
are under this mistaken impression, Shannon continues, mayalso fear that the defendant, if released, would pose a danger
to the community. Shannon concludes that such jurors, inorder to ensure that the defendant will not be released, may
be tempted to return a guilty verdict in a case in which anNGI verdict would be appropriate.

Even assuming Shannon is correct that some jurors willharbor the mistaken belief that defendants found NGI will
be released into society immediately--an assumption that is

9 In the court below, Shannon made the additional argument that because Congress filled the "gap" that had been identified by the Federal
Courts of Appeals prior to the IDRA with a general federal civil commitment procedure, "the practice announced in Lyles must now be applied
nationwide." 981 F. 2d 759, 763 (CA5 1993). We find this argument
(which Shannon makes only implicitly before this Court) unpersuasive.
As noted above, although the lack of a federal commitment procedure before the passage of the IDRA was one reason for rejecting a Lyles-type
instruction, courts generally, and properly, relied additionally on the principle that juries are not to be concerned with the consequences of their
verdicts. This principle is not altered by the fact that Congress established a civil commitment procedure. See Thigpen, 4 F. 3d, at 1577.

open to debate 10--the jury in his case was instructed "toapply the law as [instructed] regardless of the consequence,"

and that "punishment . . . should not enter your considerationor discussion." App. A-27 to A-28. That an NGI verdict
was an option here gives us no reason to depart from "thealmost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow
their instructions." Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U. S. 200, 206(1987). Indeed, although it may take effort on a juror's part
to ignore the potential consequences of the verdict, the effortrequired in a case in which an NGI defense is raised is no
different from that required in many other situations. Forexample, if the Government fails to meet its burden of proof
at trial, our judicial system necessarily assumes that a jurorwill vote to acquit, rather than to convict, even if he is convinced the defendant is highly dangerous and should be in-carcerated. We do not believe that the situation involving
an NGI verdict should be treated any differently.We also are not persuaded that the instruction Shannon
proposes would allay the fears of the misinformed jurorabout whom Shannon is concerned. "[I]f the members of a
jury are so fearful of a particular defendant's release thatthey would violate their oaths by convicting [the defendant]
solely in order to ensure that he is not set free, it is question-able whether they would be reassured by anything short of
an instruction strongly suggesting that the defendant, iffound NGI, would very likely be civilly committed for a

10 We are not convinced that jurors are as unfamiliar with the consequences of an NGI verdict as Shannon suggests. It may have been the
case in 1957 that, in contrast to verdicts of guilty and not guilty, "a verdict
of not guilty by reason of insanity ha[d] no . . . commonly understood
meaning." Lyles v. United States, 254 F. 2d 725, 728 (CADC 1957) (en
banc), cert. denied, 356 U. S. 961 (1958). Today, however, there is no reason to assume that jurors believe that defendants found NGI are immediately set free. See Fisher, 10 F. 3d, at 122 ("[H]ighly publicized cases,
such as that involving John Hinckley, have dramatized the possibility of
civil commitment following an NGI verdict"). See also Blume, 967 F. 2d,
at 54 (Winter, J., concurring in result).

lengthy period." United States v. Fisher, 10 F. 3d 115, 122(CA3 1993), cert. pending, No. 93-7000. An accurate instruction about the consequences of an NGI verdict, how-ever, would give no such assurance. Under the IDRA, a
postverdict hearing must be held within 40 days to deter-mine whether the defendant should be released immediately
into society or hospitalized. See 18 U. S. C. $$ 4243(c), (d).Thus, the only mandatory period of confinement for an insanity acquittee is the period between the verdict and the hear-ing. Instead of encouraging a juror to return an NGI verdict, as Shannon predicts, such information might have theopposite effect--that is, a juror might vote to convict in
order to eliminate the possibility that a dangerous defendantcould be released after 40 days or less.

11 Whether the

instruction works to the advantage or disadvantage of adefendant is, of course, somewhat beside the point. Our

central concern here is that the inevitable result of suchan instruction would be to draw the jury's attention toward
the very thing--the possible consequences of its verdict--it should ignore.

Moreover, Shannon offers us no principled way to limit theavailability of instructions detailing the consequences of a
verdict to cases in which an NGI defense is raised. Jurorsmay be as unfamiliar with other aspects of the criminal sentencing process as they are with NGI verdicts. But, as ageneral matter, jurors are not informed of mandatory minimum or maximum sentences, nor are they instructed regard11 As the court below observed, "a jury could assume that due to overcrowded mental hospitals, strapped social services budgets, sympathetic
judges, etc., a defendant will be released after only a short period of commitment. To combat the prospect of early release, the jury could simply
opt to find him guilty." 981 F. 2d, at 763, n. 6. Indeed, depending upon
the content of the instruction, information regarding the consequences of
an NGI verdict could influence a juror's decision in countless--and unpredictable--ways. See, e. g., Fisher, supra, at 121-122, and n. 7 (describing
various scenarios in which sentencing information could induce compromise verdicts in the NGI context).

ing probation, parole, or the sentencing range accompanyinga lesser included offense. See United States v. Thigpen, 4

F. 3d 1573, 1578 (CA11 1993) (en banc), cert. pending, No.93-6747; United States v. Frank, 956 F. 2d 872, 879 (CA9
1991), cert. denied, 506 U. S. 932 (1992). Because it is con-ceivable that some jurors might harbor misunderstandings
with regard to these sentencing options, a district court,under Shannon's reasoning, might be obligated to give juries
information regarding these possibilities as well. In short,if we pursue the logic of Shannon's position, the rule against
informing jurors of the consequences of their verdicts wouldsoon be swallowed by the exceptions.

Finally, Congress' recent action in this area counsels hesi-tation in invoking our supervisory powers. As noted above,
the IDRA was the product of a thorough and exhaustive re-view of the insanity defense as used in the federal courts.
Given the comprehensive nature of the task before it, Con-gress certainly could have included a provision requiring the
instruction Shannon seeks. For whatever reason, Congresschose not to do so. Under these circumstances, we are reluctant to depart from well-established principles of criminalpractice without more explicit guidance from Congress.

III
Although we conclude that the IDRA does not require aninstruction concerning the consequences of an NGI verdict,

and that such an instruction is not to be given as a matterof general practice, we recognize that an instruction of some
form may be necessary under certain limited circumstances.If, for example, a witness or prosecutor states in the presence of the jury that a particular defendant would "go free"if found NGI, it may be necessary for the district court to
intervene with an instruction to counter such a misstate-ment. The appropriate response, of course, will vary as is
necessary to remedy the specific misstatement or error. Wenote this possibility merely so that our decision will not be

misunderstood as an absolute prohibition on instructing thejury with regard to the consequences of an NGI verdict.

Our observations in this regard are not applicable to Shan-non's situation, however, for there is no indication that any
improper statement was made in the presence of the juryduring his trial.

A rule that has minimized the risk of injustice for almost40 years should not be abandoned without good reason. In
1957, shortly after Congress enacted the statute providingfor civil commitment of persons found not guilty by reason
of insanity in trials conducted in the District of Columbia,the Court of Appeals, sitting in banc, considered whether
juries should be instructed about the significance of that pro-vision. Recognizing that an uninformed jury might erroneously find an insane defendant guilty to avoid the risk that adangerous individual would otherwise go free, the court held
that such an instruction should be given. Lyles v. UnitedStates, 254 F. 2d 725 (CADC 1957), cert. denied, 356 U. S. 961
(1958). In an opinion jointly authored by Judge Prettymanand then-Judge Warren Burger, the court explained that the
doctrine that the jury has no concern with the consequencesof a verdict "does not apply in the problem before us":

"The issue of insanity having been fairly raised, thejury may return one of three verdicts, guilty, not guilty,
or not guilty by reason of insanity. Jurors, in commonwith people in general, are aware of the meanings of
verdicts of guilty and not guilty. . . . But a verdict ofnot guilty by reason of insanity has no such commonly
understood meaning. . . . It means neither freedom nor

punishment. It means the accused will be confined in ahospital for the mentally ill until the superintendent of

such hospital certifies, and the court is satisfied, thatsuch person has recovered his sanity and will not in the
reasonable future be dangerous to himself or others.We think the jury has a right to know the meaning of
this possible verdict as accurately as it knows by com-mon knowledge the meaning of the other two possible
verdicts." Lyles, 254 F. 2d, at 728.
Concurring with this part of the foregoing opinion, JudgeBazelon acknowledged that "[t]he false assumption that acquittal by reason of insanity, like outright acquittal, frees theaccused to walk out on the streets may lead juries to convict,
despite strong evidence of insanity at the time of the crime."Id., at 734. Trial courts in the District of Columbia have
used a pattern instruction--approved by prosecutors, de-fense counsel, and trial judges--ever since.

1

Other federal courts did not give a comparable instructionprior to 1984 because no federal statute authorized civil commitment for insanity acquittees except in the District of Co-lumbia. In those courts, an instruction advising the jury
about the consequences of a verdict of not guilty by reasonof insanity--often that such a defendant would, indeed, go
free--would have tended to increase the risk of improperconvictions. It was therefore appropriate for federal judges
to adhere to the general rule that the jury should be in-structed to base its decision on the evidence before it, with1 Instruction 5.11 in the 1978 edition of the District of Columbia Criminal Jury Instructions reads:

"If the defendant is found not guilty by reason of insanity it becomes
the duty of the court to commit him to St. Elizabeths Hospital. There
will be a hearing within 50 days to determine whether the defendant is
entitled to release. In that hearing the defendant has the burden of proof.
The defendant will remain in custody, and will be entitled to release from
custody only if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that he
is not likely to injure himself or other persons due to mental illness."

Stevens, J., dissenting
out regard to the possible consequences of its verdict. That
rule, of course, was primarily designed to protect defendants
from the risk that jurors might otherwise improperly rely on
matters such as sympathy for the victim, arguments of counsel, or inadmissible comments in the courtroom.

When Congress enacted the Insanity Defense Reform Act
of 1984 (Act), 18 U. S. C. $$ 17, 4241-4247, it established a
civil commitment process for the entire federal system, thus
making the basis for the District of Columbia Circuit's holding in Lyles applicable to all federal courts. The Act's legislative history unmistakably demonstrates that the Act's
sponsors assumed that the Lyles precedent would thereafter
be followed nationwide. See ante, at 583. That assumption
does not have the force of a statutory mandate, but it verifies
that thoughtful legislators familiar with the issue believed
that precedent to be entirely sound. That this Court should
now decide to change an established rule that Congress accepted and that protects defendants meaningfully against an
obvious risk of injustice is startling--particularly when that
change is for no reason other than a perceived inconsistency
with another rule that is generally protective of defendants'
rights. A far wiser disposition would allow the defendant
to choose between the two rules, rather than tilt the scales
to favor the prosecutor in every case.

The incongruity of the Court's holding is compounded by
its selection of Rogers v. United States, 422 U. S. 35 (1975),
as its authority for what it calls the "principle" that juries
should not consider the consequences of their verdict. Ante,
at 579. It is worth noting that the writer of the Court's
opinion in Rogers--Chief Justice Burger--was also one of
the authors of Lyles. In Rogers, the jury had sent the judge
a note asking whether he would accept a verdict of "Guilty as
charged with extreme mercy of the Court"; when the court
answered yes, the jury returned five minutes later with that
verdict. Rogers, 422 U. S., at 36-37. What Rogers held is

Stevens, J., dissenting
that the guilty verdict had to be set aside because the court
had violated Rule 43 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure by responding to an inquiry from the jury without advising defense counsel. Id., at 40-41. The Court also considered the judge's response to be misleading because it did
not advise the jury that their recommendation of mercy
would not be binding on the court. Ibid. In that context,
the failure to admonish the jury that it should reach its verdict without regard to what sentence might be imposed was
prejudicial to the defendant. Instead of supporting the majority's view, the case is more relevant for its illustration of
how concerned juries are about the actual consequences of
their verdicts. When there is a realistic danger that jurors'
deliberations may be distorted by an incorrect assumption
about those consequences, elementary notions of fairness demand that a clarifying instruction be given.

The Court suggests that the instruction might actually
prejudice the defendant. Ante, at 585-586. That argument lacks merit, as there is no need to give the instruction
unless the defendant requests it. Alternatively, the Court
advances the tired argument that if we followed the practice
approved in Lyles, "the rule against informing jurors of the
consequences of their verdicts would soon be swallowed by
the exceptions," ante, at 587. Given that the Lyles rule has
survived in the District since 1957 without such consequences, this concern is illusory. Some courts have assumed
that the instruction would help jurors focus on issues of guilt
instead of punishment. "Freed from confusion and fear as
to the practical effect of a verdict of not guilty by reason of
insanity, jurors should be able to decide the insanity issue
solely on the evidence and law governing the defense."
State v. Shickles, 760 P. 2d 291, 298 (Utah 1988). Rather
than relying on a totally unsubstantiated qualm belied by
history, it would be far wiser for the Court simply to recognize both the seriousness of the harm that may result from

Stevens, J., dissenting
the refusal to give the instruction and the absence of anyidentifiable countervailing harm that may result from giving it.The Court also contends that jurors today are more familiar with the consequences of a verdict of not guilty by reasonof insanity than they were in 1957 when

Lyles was decided.Ante, at 584, n. 9. No one has suggested, however, that the

level of understanding even approximates that of the conven-tional choice between "guilty" and "not guilty." Indeed, one
recent study concluded that "the public overestimates theextent to which insanity acquittees are released upon acquittal and underestimates the extent to which they are hospi-talized as well as the length of confinement of insanity acquittees who are sent to mental hospitals." 2 As long assignificant numbers of potential jurors believe that an insanity acquittee will be released at once, the instruction servesa critical purpose. Yet even if, as the Court seems prepared
to assume, all jurors are already knowledgeable about theissue, surely telling them what they already know can do
no harm.An increasing number of States that have considered the
question endorses use of the instruction,3 as has the Ameri-can Bar Association.

WILLIAMSON v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 93-5256. Argued April 25, 1994--Decided June 27, 1994
After Reginald Harris refused to testify at petitioner Williamson's federal

trial on cocaine possession and distribution charges, the District Court
ruled that, under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3)'s hearsay exception
for statements against penal interest, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent could recount two custodial interviews in which Harris had
freely confessed to receiving and transporting the drugs in question,
but also implicated Williamson as the drugs' owner. Williamson was
eventually convicted, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded.
981 F. 2d 1262, vacated and remanded.

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court with respect
to Parts I, II-A, and II-B, concluding:

1. The most faithful reading of Rule 804(b)(3)--which renders admissible "statement[s] which . . . so far ten[d] to subject the declarant to . . .
criminal liability . . . that a reasonable person . . . would not have made
[them] unless believing [them] to be true"--is that it does not allow
admission of non-self-inculpatory statements, even if they are made
within a broader narrative that is generally self-inculpatory. Although
the statutory term "statement" can mean either an extended declaration
or a single remark, the principle behind the Rule, so far as it is discernible from the text, points clearly to the narrower reading, so that only
those remarks within a confession that are individually self-inculpatory
are covered. The Rule is founded on the commonsense notion that reasonable people, even those who are not especially honest, tend not to
make self-inculpatory statements unless they believe them to be true.
This notion does not extend to a confession's non-self-inculpatory
parts--to parts that are actually self-exculpatory, or to collateral statements, even ones that are neutral as to interest. A district court may
not just assume that a statement is self-inculpatory because it is part of
a fuller confession, especially when the statement implicates someone
else. The policy expressed in the Rule's text is clear enough that it
outweighs whatever force lies in ambiguous statements contained in the
Advisory Committee Notes to the Rule. Pp. 598-602.

2. The foregoing reading does not eviscerate the against penal interest exception. There are many circumstances in which Rule 804(b)(3)

does allow the admission of statements that inculpate a criminal defendant. Even the confessions of arrested accomplices may be admissible if
they are truly self-inculpatory, rather than merely attempts to shift
blame or curry favor. The question under the Rule is always whether
the statement at issue was sufficiently against the declarant's penal interest under the Rule's language, and this question can only be answered in light of all the surrounding circumstances. Pp. 602-604.

Justice O'Connor, joined by Justice Scalia, concluded in Part
II-C that, on remand, the Court of Appeals must inquire in the first
instance whether each of the statements in Harris' confession was truly
self-inculpatory. Pp. 604-605.

O'Connor, J., announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the
opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II-A, and II-B, in which

Opinion of the Court

In this case we clarify the scope of the hearsay exceptionfor statements against penal interest. Fed. Rule Evid.
804(b)(3). I

A deputy sheriff stopped the rental car driven by ReginaldHarris for weaving on the highway. Harris consented to a
search of the car, which revealed 19 kilograms of cocaine intwo suitcases in the trunk. Harris was promptly arrested.

Shortly after Harris' arrest, Special Agent Donald Waltonof the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) interviewed
him by telephone. During that conversation, Harris saidthat he got the cocaine from an unidentified Cuban in Fort
Lauderdale; that the cocaine belonged to petitioner William-son; and that it was to be delivered that night to a particular
dumpster. Williamson was also connected to Harris byphysical evidence: The luggage bore the initials of Williamson's sister, Williamson was listed as an additional driver onthe car rental agreement, and an envelope addressed to Williamson and a receipt with Williamson's girlfriend's addresswere found in the glove compartment.

Several hours later, Agent Walton spoke to Harris in per-son. During that interview, Harris said he had rented the
car a few days earlier and had driven it to Fort Lauderdaleto meet Williamson. According to Harris, he had gotten the
cocaine from a Cuban who was Williamson's acquaintance,and the Cuban had put the cocaine in the car with a note
telling Harris how to deliver the drugs. Harris repeatedthat he had been instructed to leave the drugs in a certain
dumpster, to return to his car, and to leave without waitingfor anyone to pick up the drugs.

Agent Walton then took steps to arrange a controlled de-livery of the cocaine. But as Walton was preparing to leave
the interview room, Harris "got out of [his] chair . . . and . . .

took a half step toward [Walton] . . . and . . . said, . . . `I can'tlet you do that,' threw his hands up and said `that's not true,

I can't let you go up there for no reason.' " App. 40. Harristold Walton he had lied about the Cuban, the note, and the
dumpster. The real story, Harris said, was that he wastransporting the cocaine to Atlanta for Williamson, and that
Williamson was traveling in front of him in another rentalcar. Harris added that after his car was stopped, Williamson turned around and drove past the location of the stop,where he could see Harris' car with its trunk open.

Ibid.Because Williamson had apparently seen the police searching

the car, Harris explained that it would be impossible to makea controlled delivery.

Id., at 41.Harris told Walton that he had lied about the source of the

drugs because he was afraid of Williamson. Id., at 61, 68;see also id., at 30-31. Though Harris freely implicated himself, he did not want his story to be recorded, and he refusedto sign a written version of the statement. Id., at 24-25.
Walton testified that he had promised to report any coop-eration by Harris to the Assistant United States Attorney.
Walton said Harris was not promised any reward or otherbenefit for cooperating.

interest."Second, defendant Harris, the declarant, is

A

The hearsay rule, Fed. Rule Evid. 802, is premised on thetheory that out-of-court statements are subject to particular

hazards. The declarant might be lying; he might have mis-perceived the events which he relates; he might have faulty
memory; his words might be misunderstood or taken out ofcontext by the listener. And the ways in which these dangers are minimized for in-court statements--the oath, thewitness' awareness of the gravity of the proceedings, the
jury's ability to observe the witness' demeanor, and, mostimportantly, the right of the opponent to cross-examine--are
generally absent for things said out of court.

Nonetheless, the Federal Rules of Evidence also recognizethat some kinds of out-of-court statements are less subject

to these hearsay dangers, and therefore except them fromthe general rule that hearsay is inadmissible. One such cat512us3$88J 12-28-97 16:12:24 PAGES OPINPGT

599Cite as: 512 U. S. 594 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
egory covers statements that are against the declarant's
interest:

"statement[s] which . . . at the time of [their] making . . .
so far tended to subject the declarant to . . . criminal
liability . . . that a reasonable person in the declarant's
position would not have made the statement[s] unless
believing [them] to be true." Fed. Rule Evid. 804(b)(3).

To decide whether Harris' confession is made admissible
by Rule 804(b)(3), we must first determine what the Rule
means by "statement," which Federal Rule of Evidence
801(a)(1) defines as "an oral or written assertion." One possible meaning, "a report or narrative," Webster's Third New
International Dictionary 2229, defn. 2(a) (1961), connotes an
extended declaration. Under this reading, Harris' entire
confession--even if it contains both self-inculpatory and
non-self-inculpatory parts--would be admissible so long as
in the aggregate the confession sufficiently inculpates him.
Another meaning of "statement," "a single declaration or remark," ibid., defn. 2(b), would make Rule 804(b)(3) cover only
those declarations or remarks within the confession that are
individually self-inculpatory. See also id., at 131 (defining
"assertion" as a "declaration"); id., at 586 (defining "declaration" as a "statement").

Although the text of the Rule does not directly resolve the
matter, the principle behind the Rule, so far as it is discernible from the text, points clearly to the narrower reading.
Rule 804(b)(3) is founded on the commonsense notion that
reasonable people, even reasonable people who are not especially honest, tend not to make self-inculpatory statements
unless they believe them to be true. This notion simply
does not extend to the broader definition of "statement."
The fact that a person is making a broadly self-inculpatory
confession does not make more credible the confession's nonself-inculpatory parts. One of the most effective ways to lie

600 WILLIAMSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
is to mix falsehood with truth, especially truth that seemsparticularly persuasive because of its self-inculpatory nature.

In this respect, it is telling that the non-self-inculpatorythings Harris said in his first statement actually proved to
be false, as Harris himself admitted during the second interrogation. And when part of the confession is actually self-exculpatory, the generalization on which Rule 804(b)(3)

is founded becomes even less applicable. Self-exculpatorystatements are exactly the ones which people are most likely
to make even when they are false; and mere proximity toother, self-inculpatory, statements does not increase the
plausibility of the self-exculpatory statements.

We therefore cannot agree with Justice Kennedy's suggestion that the Rule can be read as expressing a policy that
collateral statements--even ones that are not in any way
against the declarant's interest--are admissible, post, at 614.
Nothing in the text of Rule 804(b)(3) or the general theory
of the hearsay Rules suggests that admissibility should turn
on whether a statement is collateral to a self-inculpatory
statement. The fact that a statement is self-inculpatory
does make it more reliable; but the fact that a statement is
collateral to a self-inculpatory statement says nothing at all
about the collateral statement's reliability. We see no reason why collateral statements, even ones that are neutral
as to interest, post, at 617-619 (Kennedy, J., concurring in
judgment), should be treated any differently from other
hearsay statements that are generally excluded.

Congress certainly could, subject to the constraints of the
Confrontation Clause, make statements admissible based on
their proximity to self-inculpatory statements. But we will
not lightly assume that the ambiguous language means anything so inconsistent with the Rule's underlying theory.
See Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S. 384, 394-395,
408-409 (1990). In our view, the most faithful reading of
Rule 804(b)(3) is that it does not allow admission of non-selfinculpatory statements, even if they are made within a

Opinion of the Court
broader narrative that is generally self-inculpatory. The
district court may not just assume for purposes of Rule
804(b)(3) that a statement is self-inculpatory because it is
part of a fuller confession, and this is especially true when
the statement implicates someone else. "[T]he arrest statements of a codefendant have traditionally been viewed with
special suspicion. Due to his strong motivation to implicate
the defendant and to exonerate himself, a codefendant's
statements about what the defendant said or did are less
credible than ordinary hearsay evidence." Lee v. Illinois,
476 U. S. 530, 541 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted);
see also Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123, 136 (1968);
Dutton v. Evans, 400 U. S. 74, 98 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in result).

Justice Kennedy suggests that the Advisory Committee's Notes to Rule 804(b)(3) should be read as endorsing
the position we reject--that an entire narrative, including
non-self-inculpatory parts (but excluding the clearly selfserving parts, post, at 620), may be admissible if it is in
the aggregate self-inculpatory. See post, at 614-615. The
Notes read, in relevant part:

"[T]he third-party confession . . . may include statements implicating [the accused], and under the general
theory of declarations against interest they would be admissible as related statements. . . . [Douglas v. Alabama,

380 U. S. 415 (1965), and Bruton v. United States, 391
U. S. 123 (1968),] . . . by no means require that all statements implicating another person be excluded from the
category of declarations against interest. Whether a
statement is in fact against interest must be determined
from the circumstances of each case. Thus a statement
admitting guilt and implicating another person, made
while in custody, may well be motivated by a desire to
curry favor with the authorities and hence fail to qualify
as against interest. . . . On the other hand, the same

words spoken under different circumstances, e. g., to anacquaintance, would have no difficulty in qualifying. . . .

"The balancing of self-serving against dissenting [sic]aspects of a declaration is discussed in McCormick

$ 256." 28 U. S. C. App., p. 790.
This language, however, is not particularly clear, and someof it--especially the Advisory Committee's endorsement of

the position taken by Dean McCormick's treatise--points theother way:

"A certain latitude as to contextual statements, neutralas to interest, giving meaning to the declaration against
interest seems defensible, but bringing in self-servingstatements contextually seems questionable.

. . . . .
". . . [A]dmit[ting] the disserving parts of the declara-tion, and exclud[ing] the self-serving parts . . . seems

the most realistic method of adjusting admissibility totrustworthiness, where the serving and disserving parts
can be severed." See C. McCormick, Law of Evidence$ 256, pp. 552-553 (1954) (footnotes omitted).

Without deciding exactly how much weight to give the Notesin this particular situation, compare Schiavone v. Fortune,
477 U. S. 21, 31 (1986) (Notes are to be given some weight),with Green v. Bock Laundry Machine Co., 490 U. S. 504, 528
(1989) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (Notes ought tobe given no weight), we conclude that the policy expressed
in the Rule's text points clearly enough in one direction thatit outweighs whatever force the Notes may have. And
though Justice Kennedy believes that the text can fairlybe read as expressing a policy of admitting collateral statements, post, at 614, for the reasons given above we disagree.

B
We also do not share Justice Kennedy's fears that ourreading of the Rule "eviscerate[s] the against penal interest

Opinion of the Court
exception," post, at 616 (internal quotation marks omitted),or makes it lack "meaningful effect,"

ibid. There are many
circumstances in which Rule 804(b)(3) does allow the admis-sion of statements that inculpate a criminal defendant.

Even the confessions of arrested accomplices may be admissible if they are truly self-inculpatory, rather than merelyattempts to shift blame or curry favor.

For instance, a declarant's squarely self-inculpatory con-fession--"yes, I killed X"--will likely be admissible under
Rule 804(b)(3) against accomplices of his who are being triedunder a co-conspirator liability theory. See

Pinkerton v.
United States, 328 U. S. 640, 647 (1946). Likewise, by showing that the declarant knew something, a self-inculpatory
statement can in some situations help the jury infer that his
confederates knew it as well. And when seen with other
evidence, an accomplice's self-inculpatory statement can inculpate the defendant directly: "I was robbing the bank on
Friday morning," coupled with someone's testimony that the
declarant and the defendant drove off together Friday morning, is evidence that the defendant also participated in the
robbery.

Moreover, whether a statement is self-inculpatory or not
can only be determined by viewing it in context. Even
statements that are on their face neutral may actually be
against the declarant's interest. "I hid the gun in Joe's
apartment" may not be a confession of a crime; but if it is
likely to help the police find the murder weapon, then it is
certainly self-inculpatory. "Sam and I went to Joe's house"
might be against the declarant's interest if a reasonable person in the declarant's shoes would realize that being linked to
Joe and Sam would implicate the declarant in Joe and Sam's
conspiracy. And other statements that give the police significant details about the crime may also, depending on the
situation, be against the declarant's interest. The question
under Rule 804(b)(3) is always whether the statement was
sufficiently against the declarant's penal interest "that a rea512us3$88J 12-28-97 16:12:25 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
sonable person in the declarant's position would not have
made the statement unless believing it to be true," and this
question can only be answered in light of all the surrounding circumstances.*

C
In this case, however, we cannot conclude that all that
Harris said was properly admitted. Some of Harris' confession would clearly have been admissible under Rule
804(b)(3); for instance, when he said he knew there was cocaine in the suitcase, he essentially forfeited his only possible
defense to a charge of cocaine possession, lack of knowledge.
But other parts of his confession, especially the parts that
implicated Williamson, did little to subject Harris himself to
criminal liability. A reasonable person in Harris' position
might even think that implicating someone else would decrease his practical exposure to criminal liability, at least so
far as sentencing goes. Small fish in a big conspiracy often
get shorter sentences than people who are running the whole
show, see, e. g., United States Sentencing Commission,
Guidelines Manual $ 3B1.2 (Nov. 1993), especially if the small
fish are willing to help the authorities catch the big ones, see,
e. g., id., $ 5K1.1.

Nothing in the record shows that the District Court or the
Court of Appeals inquired whether each of the statements in
Harris' confession was truly self-inculpatory. As we explained above, this can be a fact-intensive inquiry, which
would require careful examination of all the circumstances
surrounding the criminal activity involved; we therefore remand to the Court of Appeals to conduct this inquiry in the
first instance.

*Of course, an accomplice's statements may also be admissible under
other provisions of Rules 801-804. For instance, statements made in furtherance of the conspiracy may be admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), and
other statements that bear circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness
may be admissible under Rule 804(b)(5), the catchall hearsay exception.

Scalia, J., concurring
In light of this disposition, we need not address William-son's claim that the statements were also made inadmissible

by the Confrontation Clause, see generally White v. Illinois,502 U. S. 346 (1992), and in particular we need not decide
whether the hearsay exception for declarations against inter-est is "firmly rooted" for Confrontation Clause purposes.
Compare, e. g., United States v. Seeley, 892 F. 2d 1, 2 (CA11989) (holding that the exception is firmly rooted), with
United States v. Flores, 985 F. 2d 770 (CA5 1993) (holdingthe contrary). We note, however, that the very fact that a
statement is genuinely self-inculpatory--which our readingof Rule 804(b)(3) requires--is itself one of the "particularized
guarantees of trustworthiness" that makes a statementadmissible under the Confrontation Clause. See Lee v. Illinois, 476 U. S. 530, 543-545 (1986). We also need not decidewhether, as some Courts of Appeals have held, the second
sentence of Rule 804(b)(3)--"A statement tending to exposethe declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate
the accused is not admissible unless corroborating circum-stances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement" (emphasis added)--also requires that statementsinculpating the accused be supported by corroborating circumstances. See, e. g., United States v. Alvarez, 584 F. 2d694, 701 (CA5 1978);

United States v. Taggart, 944 F. 2d 837,840 (CA11 1991). The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.

So ordered.
Justice Scalia, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion, which I do not understand torequire the simplistic view of statements against penal interest that Justice Kennedy attributes to it.When analyzing whether evidence can be admitted under
the statement-against-penal-interest exception to the hear-say rules, the relevant inquiry must always be, as the text
directs, whether the statement "at the time of its making . . .

so far tended to subject the declarant to . . . criminal liability. . . that a reasonable person in the declarant's position would

not have made the statement unless believing it to be true."Fed. Rule Evid. 804(b)(3). I quite agree with the Court that
a reading of the term "statement" to connote an extended
declaration (and which would thereby allow both self-inculpatory and non-self-inculpatory parts of a declaration

to be admitted so long as the declaration in the aggregatewas sufficiently inculpatory) is unsupportable. See

ante, at
599-600.Employing the narrower definition of "statement," so that

Rule 804(b)(3) allows admission of only those remarks that
are individually self-inculpatory, does not, as Justice Kennedy states, "eviscerate the against penal interest exception." Post, at 616 (internal quotation marks and citation
omitted). A statement obviously can be self-inculpatory (in
the sense of having so much of a tendency to subject one to
criminal liability that a reasonable person would not make
it without believing it to be true) without consisting of the
confession "I committed X element of crime Y." Consider,
for example, a declarant who stated: "On Friday morning, I
went into a gunshop and (lawfully) bought a particular type
of handgun and particular type of ammunition. I then drove
in my 1958 blue Edsel and parked in front of the First City
Bank with the keys in the ignition and the driver's door ajar.
I then went inside, robbed the bank, and shot the security
guard." Although the declarant has not confessed to any
element of a crime in the first two sentences, those statements in context are obviously against his penal interest, and
I have no doubt that a trial judge could properly admit them.

Moreover, a declarant's statement is not magically transformed from a statement against penal interest into one that
is inadmissible merely because the declarant names another
person or implicates a possible codefendant. For example,
if a lieutenant in an organized crime operation described the
inner workings of an extortion and protection racket, naming

some of the other actors and thereby inculpating himself onracketeering and/or conspiracy charges, I have no doubt that

some of those remarks could be admitted as statementsagainst penal interest. Of course, naming another person, if
done, for example, in a context where the declarant is minimizing culpability or criminal exposure, can bear on whetherthe statement meets the Rule 804(b)(3) standard. The relevant inquiry, however--and one that is not furthered byclouding the waters with manufactured categories such as
"collateral neutral" and "collateral self-serving," see, e. g.,
post, at 612, 618 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment)--
must always be whether the particular remark at issue (and
not the extended narrative) meets the standard set forth in
the Rule.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Blackmun, Justice Stevens, and Justice Souter join, concurring in part
and concurring in the judgment.

I join Parts I, II-A, and II-B of the Court's opinion. I
agree with the Court that Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3)
excepts from the general rule that hearsay statements are
inadmissible only "those declarations or remarks within [a
narrative] that are individually self-inculpatory." Ante, at
599. As the Court explains, the exception for statements
against penal interest "does not allow admission of non-selfinculpatory statements, even if they are made within a
broader narrative that is generally self-inculpatory," ante, at
600-601; the exception applies only to statements that are
"sufficiently against the declarant's penal interest `that a reasonable person in the declarant's position would not have
made the statement unless believing it to be true.' " Ante,
at 603-604, quoting Fed. Rule Evid. 804(b)(3).

Further, the Court recognizes the untrustworthiness of
statements implicating another person. Ante, at 601. A
person arrested in incriminating circumstances has a strong
incentive to shift blame or downplay his own role in compari512us3$88P 12-28-97 16:12:25 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Ginsburg, J.
son with that of others, in hopes of receiving a shorter sen-tence and leniency in exchange for cooperation. For this

reason, hearsay accounts of a suspect's statements implicat-ing another person have been held inadmissible under the
Confrontation Clause. See Lee v. Illinois, 476 U. S. 530, 541
(1986) ("when one person accuses another of a crime undercircumstances in which the declarant stands to gain by inculpating another, the accusation is presumptively suspect andmust be subjected to the scrutiny of cross-examination");
ibid. (" `[T]he arrest statements of a codefendant have tradi-tionally been viewed with special suspicion. Due to his
strong motivation to implicate the defendant and to exonerate himself, a codefendant's statements about what the defendant said or did are less credible than ordinary hearsay
evidence.' ") (quoting Bruton v. United States, 391 U. S. 123,
141 (1968) (White, J., dissenting)).

Unlike Justice O'Connor, however, I conclude that Reginald Harris' statements, as recounted by Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) Special Agent Donald E. Walton, do
not fit, even in part, within the exception described in Rule
804(b)(3), for Harris' arguably inculpatory statements are too
closely intertwined with his self-serving declarations to be
ranked as trustworthy. Harris was caught redhanded with
19 kilos of cocaine--enough to subject even a first-time offender to a minimum of 121/2 years' imprisonment. See
United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual

$ 2D1.1(c) (1993); id., ch. 5, pt. A (sentencing table). He
could have denied knowing the drugs were in the car's trunk,
but that strategy would have brought little prospect of
thwarting a criminal prosecution. He therefore admitted
involvement, but did so in a way that minimized his own
role and shifted blame to petitioner Fredel Williamson (and
a Cuban man named Shawn).

Most of Harris' statements to DEA Agent Walton focused
on Williamson's, rather than Harris', conduct. Agent Walton testified to the following: During a brief telephone con512us3$88P 12-28-97 16:12:25 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Ginsburg, J.
versation shortly after he was apprehended, Harris said he
had obtained 19 kilos of cocaine for Williamson from a Cuban
man in Fort Lauderdale, Florida; he stated that the cocaine
belonged to Williamson, and was to be delivered to a dumpster in the Atlanta area that evening. App. 37. Harris repeated this story to Agent Walton when the two spoke in
person later in the day. Harris also said that he had rented
the car a few days earlier and had included Williamson's
name on the rental contract because Williamson was going
to be in the Fort Lauderdale area with him. Id., at 38-39.
After Agent Walton sought to arrange a controlled delivery,
Harris retracted the story about the dumpster, saying it
was false.

Harris' second account differed as to collateral details, but
he continued to paint Williamson as the "big fish." Harris
reported that he was transporting the cocaine to Atlanta for
Williamson. When the police stopped Harris' car, Williamson was driving in front of him in another rented car. After
Harris was stopped, Williamson turned around and pulled
over to the side of the road; from that vantage point, he observed the police officer inspecting the contents of Harris'
trunk. Id., at 40-41. And, Harris repeated, "the arrangements for the acquisition and the transportation had been
made by Mr. Williamson." Id., at 41.

To the extent some of these statements tended to incriminate Harris, they provided only marginal or cumulative evidence of his guilt. They project an image of a person acting
not against his penal interest, but striving mightily to shift
principal responsibility to someone else. See United States
v. Sarmiento-Perez, 633 F. 2d 1092, 1102 (CA5 1981) ("[The
declarant] might well have been motivated to misrepresent
the role of others in the criminal enterprise, and might well
have viewed the statement[s] as a whole--including the ostensibly disserving portions--to be in his interest rather
than against it.").

Opinion of Ginsburg, J.
For these reasons, I would hold that none of Harris'
hearsay statements were admissible under Rule 804(b)(3).*
The trial judge characterized Agent Walton's testimony
as "very damning." App. 50. The prosecutor considered it
so prejudicial that she offered to join defense counsel's
motion for a mistrial should the trial court determine that
the hearsay statements had been erroneously admitted.
Id., at 51 ("If the [trial] Court determines that it has been
improper for [Agent Walton] to say those statements, then
the Court must of necessity declare a mistrial, because there
is no way they can remove what . . . they have heard that
Reginald Harris said about Fredel Williamson, and the
Government will join in the [defense counsel's] motion [for
a mistrial], because I think that would be a burden no
one could overcome in the 11th Circuit."). I concur in the
Court's decision to vacate the Court of Appeals' judgment,
however, because I have not examined the entire trial court
record; I therefore cannot say the Government should be
denied an opportunity to argue that the erroneous admission
of the hearsay statements, in light of the other evidence
introduced at trial, constituted harmless error. See Fed.
Rule Crim. Proc. 52(a); Kotteakos v. United States, 328
U. S. 750, 776 (1946) (error requires reversal of criminal conviction if it is "highly probable that the error had substantial

*Nor could any of Harris' hearsay statements be admitted under Rule
801(d)(2)(E), which provides that statements made "by a coconspirator of
a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy" are not
hearsay. The trial judge initially appeared to base his ruling admitting
the statements on the co-conspirator rule. See App. 34-36; id., at 47 ("I
let it in as a co-conspirator statement."). The prosecutor, however,
"agree[d] with [defense counsel] totally" that "[they are] not . . . statement[s] in furtherance of the conspiracy"; Agent Walton's testimony, she
explained, was "not offered under [the co-conspirator] exception," but
under Rule 804(b)(3). App. 47. I do not read the Court's opinion, ante,
at 604, n., to suggest that the hearsay statements in this case could have
been admitted under Rule 801(d)(2)(E).

Justice Thomas join, concurring in the judgment.

I
Federal Rule of Evidence 802 states the general rule thathearsay evidence is inadmissible in federal court proceedings, but there are numerous exceptions. At issue here isthe exception contained in Rule 804(b)(3), which allows admission of

"[a] statement which was at the time of its making sofar contrary to the declarant's pecuniary or proprietary

interest, or so far tended to subject the declarant to civilor criminal liability, or to render invalid a claim by the
declarant against another, that a reasonable person inthe declarant's position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true. A statement tend-ing to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unlesscorroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement."
The rationale of the hearsay exception for statementsagainst interest is that people seldom "make statements

which are damaging to themselves unless satisfied for goodreason that they are true." Advisory Committee's Notes on
Fed. Rule Evid. 804, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 789. Of course, thedeclarant may make his statement against interest (such as
"I shot the bank teller") together with collateral but relateddeclarations (such as "John Doe drove the getaway car").
The admissibility of those collateral statements under Rule804(b)(3) is the issue we must decide here.

There has been a long-running debate among commenta-tors over the admissibility of collateral statements. Dean
Wigmore took the strongest position in favor of admissibility,

512us3$88L 12-28-97 16:12:25 PAGES OPINPGT
612 WILLIAMSON v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
arguing that "the statement may be accepted, not merely asto the specific fact against interest, but also as to every fact

contained in the same statement." 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence$ 1465, p. 271 (3d ed. 1940) (emphasis deleted); see also 5 J.
Wigmore, Evidence $ 1465, p. 339 (J. Chadbourne rev. 1974);
Higham v. Ridgway, 10 East. 109, 103 Eng. Rep. 717 (K. B.1808). According to Wigmore, because "the statement is

made under circumstances fairly indicating the declarant'ssincerity and accuracy," the entire statement should be admitted. 5 J. Wigmore $ 1465, p. 271 (3d ed. 1940). Dean Mc-Cormick's approach regarding collateral statements was
more guarded. He argued for the admissibility of collateral
statements of a neutral character, and for the exclusion of
collateral statements of a self-serving character. For example, in the statement "John and I robbed the bank," the
words "John and" are neutral (save for the possibility of conspiracy charges). On the other hand, the statement "John,
not I, shot the bank teller" is to some extent self-serving and
therefore might be inadmissible. See C. McCormick, Law of
Evidence $ 256, pp. 552-553 (1954) (hereinafter McCormick).
Professor Jefferson took the narrowest approach, arguing
that the reliability of a statement against interest stems only
from the disserving fact stated and so should be confined "to
the proof of the fact which is against interest." Jefferson,
Declarations Against Interest: An Exception to the Hearsay
Rule, 58 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 62-63 (1944). Under the Jefferson
approach, neither collateral neutral nor collateral selfserving statements would be admissible.

Enacted by Congress in 1975, Rule 804(b)(3) establishes a
hearsay exception for statements against penal, proprietary,
pecuniary, and legal interest (and does not distinguish among
those interests). The text of the Rule does not tell us
whether collateral statements are admissible, however. See
ante, at 599; see also Comment, Federal Rule of Evidence
804(b)(3) and Inculpatory Statements Against Penal Interest, 66 Calif. L. Rev. 1189, 1202 (1978) ("The text of Rule

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
804(b)(3) by itself provides little guidance and would accom-modate comfortably either a doctrine excluding or one admitting collateral statements"). The Court resolves theissue, as I understand its opinion, by adopting the extreme
position that no collateral statements are admissible under
Rule 804(b)(3). See ante, at 599 (adopting "narrower read-ing" that "Rule 804(b)(3) cover[s] only those declarations or

remarks within the confession that are individually self-inculpatory");

ante, at 607 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment); but cf. ante, p. 605 (Scalia, J.,concurring). The Court reaches that conclusion by relying

on the "principle behind the Rule" that reasonable people do
not make statements against their interest unless they are
telling the truth, ante, at 599, and reasons that this policy
"expressed in the Rule's text," ante, at 602, "simply does
not extend" to collateral statements, ante, at 599. Though
conceding that Congress can "make statements admissible
based on their proximity to self-inculpatory statements," the
Court says that it cannot "lightly assume that the ambiguous
language means anything so inconsistent with the Rule's underlying theory." Ante, at 600.

With respect, I must disagree with this analysis. All
agree that the justification for admission of hearsay statements against interest was, as it still is, that reasonable people do not make those statements unless believing them to
be true, but that has not resolved the long-running debate
over the admissibility of collateral statements, as to which
there is no clear consensus in the authorities. Indeed, to
the extent the authorities come close to any consensus,
they support admission of some collateral statements. See
supra, at 611-612. Given that the underlying principle for
the hearsay exception has not resolved the debate over collateral statements one way or the other, I submit that we
should not assume that the text of Rule 804(b)(3), which is
silent about collateral statements, in fact incorporates one of
the competing positions. The Rule's silence no more incor512us3$88L 12-28-97 16:12:25 PAGES OPINPGT

porates Jefferson's position respecting collateral statementsthan it does McCormick's or Wigmore's.

II
Because the text of Rule 804(b)(3) expresses no positionregarding the admissibility of collateral statements, we must

determine whether there are other authoritative guides onthe question. In my view, three sources demonstrate that
Rule 804(b)(3) allows the admission of some collateral state-ments: the Advisory Committee's Note, the common law of
the hearsay exception for statements against interest, andthe general presumption that Congress does not enact statutes that have almost no effect.First, the Advisory Committee's Note establishes that
some collateral statements are admissible. In fact, it refersin specific terms to the issue we here confront: "Ordinarily
the third-party confession is thought of in terms of ex-culpating the accused, but this is by no means always or
necessarily the case: it may include statements implicatinghim, and under the general theory of declarations against
interest they would be admissible as related statements."28 U. S. C. App., p. 790. This language seems a forthright
statement that collateral statements are admissible underRule 804(b)(3), but the Court reasons that "the policy expressed in the Rule's text points clearly enough in one direc-tion that it outweighs whatever force the Notes may have."
Ante, at 602. Again, however, that reasoning begs the ques-tion: What is the policy expressed in the text on the admissibility of collateral statements? As stated above, the text ofthe Rule does not answer the question whether collateral
statements are admissible. When as here the text of a Ruleof Evidence does not answer a question that must be answered in order to apply the Rule, and when the AdvisoryCommittee's Note does answer the question, our practice indicates that we should pay attention to the Advisory Com-mittee's Note. We have referred often to those Notes in in512us3$88L 12-28-97 16:12:25 PAGES OPINPGT

615Cite as: 512 U. S. 594 (1994)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
terpreting the Rules of Evidence, and I see no reason tojettison that well-established practice here. See

Huddleston v. United States, 485 U. S. 681, 688 (1988); United Statesv.

Owens, 484 U. S. 554, 562 (1988); Bourjaily v. United
States, 483 U. S. 171, 179, n. 2 (1987); United States v. Abel,
469 U. S. 45, 51 (1984).Second, even if the Advisory Committee's Note were silent

about collateral statements, I would not adopt a rule exclud-ing all statements collateral or related to the specific words
against penal interest. Absent contrary indications, we canpresume that Congress intended the principles and terms
used in the Federal Rules of Evidence to be applied as they
were at common law. See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U. S. 579, 588 (1993); Green v. Bock Laundry Machine Co., 490 U. S. 504, 521-522 (1989); United States
v. Abel, supra, at 51-52; see also Midlantic Nat. Bank v.
New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protection, 474 U. S.
494, 501 (1986) ("[I]f Congress intends for legislation to
change the interpretation of a judicially created concept, it
makes that intent specific"). Application of that interpretive principle indicates that collateral statements should be
admissible. "From the very beginning of this exception, it
has been held that a declaration against interest is admissible, not only to prove the disserving fact stated, but also to
prove other facts contained in collateral statements connected with the disserving statement." Jefferson, 58 Harv.
L. Rev., at 57; see also McCormick $ 256; 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 1465 (3d ed. 1940). Indeed, the Advisory Committee's Note itself, in stating that collateral statements would
be admissible, referred to the "general theory" that related
statements are admissible, an indication of the state of the
law at the time the Rule was enacted. Rule 804(b)(3) does
not address the issue, but Congress legislated against the
common-law background allowing admission of some collateral statements, and I would not assume that Congress gave
the common-law rule a silent burial in Rule 804(b)(3).

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
There is yet a third reason weighing against the Court'sinterpretation, one specific to statements against penal interest that inculpate the accused. There is no dispute that thetext of Rule 804(b)(3) contemplates the admission of those
particular statements. Absent a textual direction to the
contrary, therefore, we should assume that Congress in-tended the penal interest exception for inculpatory statements to have some meaningful effect. See American
Paper Institute, Inc. v. American Elec. Power Service Corp.,
461 U. S. 402, 421 (1983) (court should not "imput[e] to Con-gress a purpose to paralyze with one hand what it sought to

promote with the other") (internal quotation marks omitted).
That counsels against adopting a rule excluding collateral
statements. As commentators have recognized, "the exclusion of collateral statements would cause the exclusion
of almost all inculpatory statements." Comment, 66 Calif.
L. Rev., at 1207; see also Note, Inculpatory Statements
Against Penal Interest and the Confrontation Clause, 83
Colum. L. Rev. 159, 163 (1983) ("[M]ost statements inculpating a defendant are only collateral to the portion of the declarant's statement that is against his own penal interest.
The portion of the statement that specifically implicates the
defendant is rarely directly counter to the declarant's penal
interest") (footnote omitted); Davenport, The Confrontation
Clause and the Co-Conspirator Exception in Criminal Prosecutions: A Functional Analysis, 85 Harv. L. Rev. 1378, 1396
(1972) ("[T]he naming of another as a compatriot will almost
never be against the declarant's own interest"). Indeed, as
one commentator indicated, the conclusion that no collateral
statements are admissible--the conclusion reached by the
Court today--would "eviscerate the against penal interest
exception." Comment, 66 Calif. L. Rev., at 1213.

To be sure, under the approach adopted by the Court,
there are some situations where the Rule would still apply.
For example, if the declarant said that he stole certain goods,
the statement could be admitted in a prosecution of the ac512us3$88L 12-28-97 16:12:25 PAGES OPINPGT

617Cite as: 512 U. S. 594 (1994)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
cused for receipt of stolen goods in order to show that thegoods were stolen. See 4 J. Weinstein & M. Berger,

Weinstein's Evidence $ 804(b)(3)[04], p. 804-164 (1993); seealso ante, at 603. But as the commentators have recognized,
it is likely to be the rare case where the precise self-inculpatory words of the declarant, without more, also inculpate the defendant. I would not presume that Congress in-tended the penal interest exception to the Rule to have so
little effect with respect to statements that inculpate theaccused.

I note finally that the Court's decision applies to state-ments against penal interest that exculpate the accused as
well as to those that inculpate the accused. Thus, if the de-clarant said, "I robbed the store alone," only the portion of
the statement in which the declarant said "I robbed thestore" could be introduced by a criminal defendant on trial
for the robbery. See Note, Declarations Against PenalInterest: Standards of Admissibility Under an Emerging
Majority Rule, 56 B. U. L. Rev. 148, 165, n. 95 (1976). Thatseems extraordinary. The Court gives no justification for
such a rule and no explanation that Congress intended theexception for exculpatory statements to have this limited effect. See id., at 166 ("A strict application of a rule excludingall collateral statements can lead to the arbitrary rejection
of valuable evidence"). III

Though I would conclude that Rule 804(b)(3) allows admis-sion of statements collateral to the precise words against interest, that conclusion of course does not answer the remain-ing question whether all collateral statements related to the
statement against interest are admissible; and if not, whatlimiting principles should apply. The Advisory Committee's
Note suggests that not all collateral statements are admissi-ble. The Note refers, for example, to McCormick's treatise,
not to Wigmore's, for guidance as to the "balancing of self-serving against dis[serving] aspects of a declaration." 28

512us3$88L 12-28-97 16:12:25 PAGES OPINPGT
618 WILLIAMSON v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
U. S. C. App., p. 790. As noted supra, at 611-612, Wigmore'sapproach would allow the admission of "every fact contained

in the same statement," but McCormick's approach is not soexpansive. McCormick stated that "[a] certain latitude as to
contextual [i. e., collateral] statements, neutral as to interest,
giving meaning to the declaration against interest seemsdefensible, but bringing in self-serving statements contextually seems questionable." McCormick $ 256, p. 552. Mc-Cormick further stated that, within a declaration containing
self-serving and disserving facts, he would "admit the dis-serving parts of the declaration, and exclude the self-serving
parts" at least "where the serving and disserving parts can
be severed." Id., $ 256, at 553. It thus appears that the
Advisory Committee's Note, by its reference to (and apparent incorporation of) McCormick, contemplates exclusion of
a collateral self-serving statement, but admission of a collateral neutral statement.

In the criminal context, a self-serving statement is one
that tends to reduce the charges or mitigate the punishment
for which the declarant might be liable. See M. Graham,
Federal Practice and Procedure $ 6795, p. 810, n. 10 (1992).
For example, if two masked gunmen robbed a bank and one
of them shot and killed the bank teller, a statement by one
robber that the other robber was the triggerman may be the
kind of self-serving statement that should be inadmissible.
See ibid. (collateral self-serving statement is "John used the
gun"). (The Government concedes that such a statement
may be inadmissible. See Brief for United States 12.) By
contrast, when two or more people are capable of committing
a crime and the declarant simply names the involved parties,
that statement often is considered neutral, not self-serving.
See Graham, supra, at 810, n. 10 ("[T]he statement `John and
I robbed the bank' is collateral neutral"); Note, 56 B. U. L.
Rev., at 166, n. 96 ("An examination of the decisions reveals
that, with very few exceptions, collateral facts offered as
part of a declaration against penal interest are neutral rather

than self-serving"); see generally United States v. York, 933F. 2d 1343, 1362-1364 (CA7 1991);

United States v. Casamento, 887 F. 2d 1141, 1171 (CA2 1989).Apart from that limit on the admission of collateral, selfserving statements, there is a separate limit applicable to
cases in which the declarant made his statement to authori-ties; this limit applies not only to collateral statements but

also to the precise words against penal interest. A declar-ant may believe that a statement of guilt to authorities is in
his interest to some extent, for example as a way to obtainmore lenient treatment, or simply to clear his conscience.
The Note takes account of that potentiality and states that
courts should examine the circumstances of the statement to
determine whether the statement was "motivated by a desire to curry favor with the authorities." 28 U. S. C. App.,
p. 790. That appears consistent with McCormick's recognition that "even though a declaration may be against interest
in one respect, if it appears that the declarant had some other
motive whether of self-interest or otherwise, which was
likely to lead him to misrepresent the facts, the declaration
will be excluded." McCormick $ 256, p. 553.

Of course, because the declarant is by definition unavailable, see Fed. Rule Evid. 804(a), and therefore cannot be
questioned to determine the exact motivation for his statement, courts have been forced to devise categories to determine when this concern is sufficient to justify exclusion of a
statement as unreliable. It has been held, for example, that
a statement to authorities admitting guilt, made after an explicit promise of dropped charges or of a reduction in prison
time in exchange for the admission of guilt, may be so unreliable as to be inadmissible. See, e. g., United States v.
Magana-Olvera, 917 F. 2d 401, 407-409 (CA9 1990); United
States v. Scopo, 861 F. 2d 339, 348 (CA2 1988) ("If . . . a
pleading defendant had an agreement with the government
or with the court that he would not be punished for the
crimes to which he allocuted, then that allocution would not

620 WILLIAMSON v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
subject him to criminal liability and would not constitute a
statement against his penal interest"). At the other extreme, when there was no promise of leniency by the government and the declarant was told that he had a right to remain
silent and that any statements he made could be used against
him, the courts have not required exclusion of the declarant's
statement against interest. See id., at 348-349; United
States v. Garcia, 897 F. 2d 1413, 1421 (CA7 1990) (declarant
not motivated by desire to curry favor; "voluntarily made his
statement after being advised of his Miranda rights and did
not enter into any plea agreements with the government").
This kind of line-drawing is appropriate and necessary, lest
the limiting principle regarding the declarant's possible desire to obtain leniency lead to the exclusion of all statements
against penal interest made to police, a result the Rule and
Note do not contemplate.

In sum, I would adhere to the following approach with
respect to statements against penal interest that inculpate
the accused. A court first should determine whether the
declarant made a statement that contained a fact against
penal interest. See ante, at 604 (opinion of O'Connor, J.)
("Some of Harris' confession would clearly have been admissible under Rule 804(b)(3)"). If so, the court should admit
all statements related to the precise statement against penal
interest, subject to two limits. Consistent with the Advisory Committee's Note, the court should exclude a collateral
statement that is so self-serving as to render it unreliable
(if, for example, it shifts blame to someone else for a crime
the defendant could have committed). In addition, in cases
where the statement was made under circumstances where
it is likely that the declarant had a significant motivation
to obtain favorable treatment, as when the government
made an explicit offer of leniency in exchange for the declarant's admission of guilt, the entire statement should be
inadmissible.

A ruling on the admissibility of evidence under Rule804(b)(3) is a preliminary question to be determined by the

district judge under Rule 104(a). That determination of ne-cessity calls for an inquiry that depends to a large extent
on the circumstances of a particular case. For this reason,application of the general principles here outlined to a particular narrative statement often will require a difficult, fact-bound determination. District judges, who are close to the
facts and far better able to evaluate the various circum-stances than an appellate court, therefore must be given
wide discretion to examine a particular statement to deter-mine whether all or part of it should be admitted. Like the
Court, then, I would remand this case, but for application ofthe analysis set forth in this opinion.

TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC., et al. v.FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION

et al.

appeal from the united states district court forthe district of columbia

No. 93-44. Argued January 12, 1994--Decided June 27, 1994
Concerned that a competitive imbalance between cable television and

over-the-air broadcasters was endangering the broadcasters' ability to
compete for a viewing audience and thus for necessary operating revenues, Congress passed the Cable Television Consumer Protection and
Competition Act of 1992. Sections 4 and 5 of the Act require cable
television systems to devote a specified portion of their channels to the
transmission of local commercial and public broadcast stations. Soon
after the Act became law, appellants, numerous cable programmers
and operators, challenged the constitutionality of the must-carry provisions. The District Court granted the United States and intervenordefendants summary judgment, ruling that the provisions are consistent
with the First Amendment. The court rejected appellants' argument
that the provisions warrant strict scrutiny as a content-based regulation
and sustained them under the intermediate standard of scrutiny set
forth in United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, concluding that they are
sufficiently tailored to serve the important governmental interest in the
preservation of local broadcasting.

Held: The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded.
819 F. Supp. 32, vacated and remanded.

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II, and III-A, concluding that the appropriate standard by
which to evaluate the constitutionality of the must-carry provisions is
the intermediate level of scrutiny applicable to content-neutral restrictions that impose an incidental burden on speech. Pp. 636-664.

(a) Because the must-carry provisions impose special obligations upon
cable operators and special burdens upon cable programmers, heightened First Amendment scrutiny is demanded. The less rigorous standard of scrutiny now reserved for broadcast regulation, see Red Lion
Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367, should not be extended to cable
regulation, since the rationale for such review--the dual problems
of spectrum scarcity and signal interference--does not apply in the
context of cable. Nor is the mere assertion of dysfunction or failure in
the cable market, without more, sufficient to shield a speech regulation
from the First Amendment standards applicable to nonbroadcast media.

Syllabus
Moreover, while enforcement of a generally applicable law against members of the press may sometimes warrant only rational-basis scrutiny,
laws that single out the press for special treatment pose a particular
danger of abuse by the State and are always subject to some degree of
heightened scrutiny. Pp. 636-641.

(b) The must-carry rules are content neutral, and thus are not subject
to strict scrutiny. They are neutral on their face because they distinguish between speakers in the television programming market based
only upon the manner in which programmers transmit their messages
to viewers, not the messages they carry. The purposes underlying the
must-carry rules are also unrelated to content. Congress' overriding
objective was not to favor programming of a particular content, but
rather to preserve access to free television programming for the 40
percent of Americans without cable. The challenged provisions' design and operation confirm this purpose. Congress' acknowledgment
that broadcast television stations make a valuable contribution to the
Nation's communications structure does not indicate that Congress regarded broadcast programming to be more valuable than cable programming; rather, it reflects only the recognition that the services provided
by broadcast television have some intrinsic value and are worth preserving against the threats posed by cable. It is also incorrect to
suggest that Congress enacted must-carry in an effort to exercise content control over what subscribers view on cable television, given the
minimal extent to which the Federal Communications Commission
and Congress influence the programming offered by broadcast stations.
Pp. 641-652.

(c) None of appellants' additional arguments suffices to require strict
scrutiny in this case. The provisions do not intrude on the editorial
control of cable operators. They are content neutral in application, and
they do not force cable operators to alter their own messages to respond
to the broadcast programming they must carry. In addition, the physical connection between the television set and the cable network gives
cable operators bottleneck, or gatekeeper, control over most programming delivered into subscribers' homes. Miami Herald Publishing Co.
v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241, and Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Public Util.
Comm'n of Cal., 475 U. S. 1, distinguished. Strict scrutiny is also not
triggered by Congress' preference for broadcasters over cable operators, since it is based not on the content of the programming each group
offers, but on the belief that broadcast television is in economic peril.
Nor is such scrutiny warranted by the fact that the provisions single
out certain members of the press--here, cable operators--for disfavored
treatment. Such differential treatment is justified by the special characteristics of the cable medium--namely, the cable operators' bottleneck

monopoly and the dangers this power poses to the viability of broadcast
television--and because the must-carry provisions are not structured in
a manner that carries the inherent risk of undermining First Amendment interests. Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U. S.
221, and Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'r of Revenue, 460 U. S. 575, distinguished. Pp. 653-661.

(d) Under O'Brien, a content-neutral regulation will be sustained if
it furthers an important governmental interest that is unrelated to the
suppression of free expression and the incidental restriction on alleged
First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest. Viewed in the abstract, each of the governmental interests asserted--preserving the benefits of free, over-the-air
local broadcast stations, promoting the widespread dissemination of information from a multiplicity of sources, and promoting fair competition
in the market for television programming--is important. Pp. 661-664.

Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Blackmun, and Justice Souter, concluded in Part III-B that the fact that
the asserted interests are important in the abstract does not mean that
the must-carry provisions will in fact advance those interests. The
Government must demonstrate that the recited harms are real, not
merely conjectural, and that the regulation will in fact alleviate these
harms in a direct and material way. Thus, the Government must adequately show that the economic health of local broadcasting is in genuine
jeopardy and in need of the protections afforded by must-carry. Assuming an affirmative answer, the Government still bears the burden of
showing that the remedy adopted does not burden substantially more
speech than is necessary to further such interests. On the state of the
record developed, and in the absence of findings of fact from the District
Court, it is not possible to conclude that the Government has satisfied
either inquiry. Because there are genuine issues of material fact still
to be resolved on this record, the District Court erred in granting summary judgment for the Government. Pp. 664-668.

Justice Stevens, though favoring affirmance, concurred in the judgment because otherwise no disposition of the case would be supported
by five Justices and because he is in substantial agreement with Justice
Kennedy's analysis of this case. P. 674.

holding that the challenged provisions are consistent withthe First Amendment. Because issues of material fact

remain unresolved in the record as developed thus far, wevacate the District Court's judgment and remand the case
for further proceedings. I

A
The role of cable television in the Nation's communicationssystem has undergone dramatic change over the past 45

years. Given the pace of technological advancement and theincreasing convergence between cable and other electronic
media, the cable industry today stands at the center of anongoing telecommunications revolution with still undefined
potential to affect the way we communicate and develop ourintellectual resources.

The earliest cable systems were built in the late 1940's tobring clear broadcast television signals to remote or mountainous communities. The purpose was not to replacebroadcast television but to enhance it. See

About Cable, ch. 1 (1979). Modern cable systems do muchmore than enhance the reception of nearby broadcast television stations. With the capacity to carry dozens of channelsand import distant programming signals via satellite or microwave relay, today's cable systems are in direct competi-tion with over-the-air broadcasters as an independent source
of television programming.Broadcast and cable television are distinguished by the
different technologies through which they reach viewers.Broadcast stations radiate electromagnetic signals from a
central transmitting antenna. These signals can be captured,in turn, by any television set within the antenna's range.
Cable systems, by contrast, rely upon a physical, point-to512us3$89L 01-08-98 12:42:35 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
point connection between a transmission facility and the tele-vision sets of individual subscribers. Cable systems make

this connection much like telephone companies, using cableor optical fibers strung aboveground or buried in ducts to
reach the homes or businesses of subscribers. The construction of this physical infrastructure entails the use of publicrights-of-way and easements and often results in the disruption of traffic on streets and other public property. As aresult, the cable medium may depend for its very existence
upon express permission from local governing authorities.See generally

Community Communications Co. v. Boulder,
660 F. 2d 1370, 1377-1378 (CA10 1981).

Cable technology affords two principal benefits over
broadcast. First, it eliminates the signal interference sometimes encountered in over-the-air broadcasting and thus
gives viewers undistorted reception of broadcast stations.
Second, it is capable of transmitting many more channels
than are available through broadcasting, giving subscribers
access to far greater programming variety. More than half
of the cable systems in operation today have a capacity to
carry between 30 and 53 channels. Television and Cable
Factbook, Services Vol. No. 62, p. I-69 (1994). And about
40 percent of cable subscribers are served by systems with
a capacity of more than 53 channels. Ibid. Newer systems
can carry hundreds of channels, and many older systems are
being upgraded with fiber optic rebuilds and digital compression technology to increase channel capacity. See, e. g.,
Cablevision Systems Adds to Rapid Fiber Growth in Cable
Systems, Communications Daily 6-7 (Feb. 26, 1993).

The cable television industry includes both cable operators
(those who own the physical cable network and transmit the
cable signal to the viewer) and cable programmers (those
who produce television programs and sell or license them to
cable operators). In some cases, cable operators have acquired ownership of cable programmers, and vice versa. Although cable operators may create some of their own pro512us3$89L 01-08-98 12:42:35 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
gramming, most of their programming is drawn from outsidesources. These outside sources include not only local or distant broadcast stations, but also the many national and re-gional cable programming networks that have emerged in
recent years, such as CNN, MTV, ESPN, TNT, C-SPAN,
The Family Channel, Nickelodeon, Arts and Entertainment,Black Entertainment Television, CourtTV, The Discovery

Channel, American Movie Classics, Comedy Central, TheLearning Channel, and The Weather Channel. Once the
cable operator has selected the programming sources, thecable system functions, in essence, as a conduit for the speech
of others, transmitting it on a continuous and unedited basis
to subscribers. See Brenner, Cable Television and the Freedom of Expression, 1988 Duke L. J. 329, 339 ("For the most
part, cable personnel do not review any of the material provided by cable networks. . . . [C]able systems have no conscious control over program services provided by others").

In contrast to commercial broadcast stations, which transmit signals at no charge to viewers and generate revenues
by selling time to advertisers, cable systems charge subscribers a monthly fee for the right to receive cable programming and rely to a lesser extent on advertising. In most
instances, cable subscribers choose the stations they will receive by selecting among various plans, or "tiers," of cable
service. In a typical offering, the basic tier consists of local
broadcast stations plus a number of cable programming networks selected by the cable operator. For an additional
cost, subscribers can obtain channels devoted to particular
subjects or interests, such as recent-release feature movies,
sports, children's programming, sexually explicit programming, and the like. Many cable systems also offer pay-perview service, which allows an individual subscriber to order
and pay a one-time fee to see a single movie or program at
a set time of the day. See J. Goodale, All About Cable: Legal
and Business Aspects of Cable and Pay Television $ 5.05[2]

630 TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion of the Court

B
On October 5, 1992, Congress overrode a Presidential veto
to enact the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102-385, 106 Stat. 1460 (1992
Cable Act or Act). Among other things, the Act subjects
the cable industry to rate regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and by municipal franchising
authorities; prohibits municipalities from awarding exclusive
franchises to cable operators; imposes various restrictions on
cable programmers that are affiliated with cable operators;
and directs the FCC to develop and promulgate regulations
imposing minimum technical standards for cable operators.
At issue in this case is the constitutionality of the so-called
must-carry provisions, contained in $$ 4 and 5 of the Act,
which require cable operators to carry the signals of a specified number of local broadcast television stations.

Section 4 requires carriage of "local commercial television
stations," defined to include all full power television broadcasters, other than those qualifying as "noncommercial educational" stations under $ 5, that operate within the same
television market as the cable system. $ 4, 47 U. S. C.

$$ 534(b)(1)(B), (h)(1)(A) (1988 ed., Supp. IV).1 Cable systems with more than 12 active channels, and more than 300
subscribers, are required to set aside up to one-third of their
channels for commercial broadcast stations that request
carriage. $ 534(b)(1)(B). Cable systems with more than
300 subscribers, but only 12 or fewer active channels, must

special market determinations upon request to better effectuate the purposes of the Act. See 1992 Cable Act $ 4, 47 U. S. C. $ 534(h)(1)(C) (1988
ed., Supp. IV).

Opinion of the Court
carry the signals of three commercial broadcast stations.

$ 534(b)(1)(A).2

If there are fewer broadcasters requesting carriage than
slots made available under the Act, the cable operator is obligated to carry only those broadcasters who make the
request. If, however, there are more requesting broadcast
stations than slots available, the cable operator is permitted
to choose which of these stations it will carry. $ 534(b)(2).3
The broadcast signals carried under this provision must be
transmitted on a continuous, uninterrupted basis, $ 534(b)(3),
and must be placed in the same numerical channel position
as when broadcast over the air, $ 534(b)(6). Further, subject
to a few exceptions, a cable operator may not charge a fee
for carrying broadcast signals in fulfillment of its must-carry
obligations. $ 534(b)(10).

Section 5 of the Act imposes similar requirements regarding the carriage of local public broadcast television stations,

2 If there are not enough local full power commercial broadcast stations
to fill the one-third allotment, a cable system with up to 35 active channels
must carry one qualified low power station and an operator with more
than 35 channels must carry two of them. See $ 534(c)(1); see also

$ 534(h)(2) (defining "qualified low power station"). Low power television
stations are small broadcast entities that transmit over a limited geographic range. They are licensed on a secondary basis and are permitted
to operate only if they do not interfere with the signals of full power
broadcast stations.

3 Cable systems are not required to carry the signal of any local commercial television station that "substantially duplicates" the signal of any
other broadcast station carried on the system. $ 534(b)(5); see also In re
Implementation of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (Broadcast Signal Carriage Issues), No. 92-259, Mar.
29, 1993, || 19 (defining "substantial duplication" as a 50 percent overlap in
programming). Nor are they required to carry the signals of more than
one station affiliated with each national broadcast network. If the cable
operator does choose to carry broadcast stations with duplicative programming, however, the system is credited with those stations for purposes of
its must-carry obligations. $ 534(b)(5).

referred to in the Act as local "noncommercial educationaltelevision stations." 47 U. S. C. $ 535(a) (1988 ed., Supp.

IV).4 A cable system with 12 or fewer channels must carryone of these stations; a system of between 13 and 36 channels
must carry between one and three; and a system with morethan 36 channels must carry each local public broadcast station requesting carriage. $$ 535(b)(2)(A), (b)(3)(A), (b)(3)(D).The Act requires a cable operator to import distant signals
in certain circumstances but provides protection againstsubstantial duplication of local noncommercial educational
stations. See $$ 535(b)(3)(B), (e). As with commercialbroadcast stations, $ 5 requires cable system operators to
carry the program schedule of the public broadcast stationin its entirety and at its same over-the-air channel position.

$$ 535(g)(1), (g)(5).Taken together, therefore, $$ 4 and 5 subject all but the
smallest cable systems nationwide to must-carry obligations,and confer must-carry privileges on all full power broadcasters operating within the same television market as a quali-fied cable system.

Congress enacted the 1992 Cable Act after conductingthree years of hearings on the structure and operation of the

cable television industry. See S. Rep. No. 102-92, pp. 3-4(1991) (describing hearings); H. R. Rep. No. 102-628, p. 74
(1992) (same). The conclusions Congress drew from its fact-finding process are recited in the text of the Act itself. See

$$ 2(a)(1)-(21). In brief, Congress found that the physicalcharacteristics of cable transmission, compounded by the in4 "Noncommercial educational television station[s]" are defined to include broadcast stations that are either (1) licensed by the FCC as a "noncommercial educational television broadcast station" and have, as licensees, entities which are eligible to receive grants from the Corporation

transmit "predominantly noncommercial programs for educational purposes." $$ 535(l)(1)(A)-(B).

Opinion of the Court
creasing concentration of economic power in the cable indus-try, are endangering the ability of over-the-air broadcast

television stations to compete for a viewing audience andthus for necessary operating revenues. Congress determined that regulation of the market for video programming
was necessary to correct this competitive imbalance.In particular, Congress found that over 60 percent of the

households with television sets subscribe to cable, $ 2(a)(3),and for these households cable has replaced over-the-air
broadcast television as the primary provider of video pro-gramming, $ 2(a)(17). This is so, Congress found, because
"[m]ost subscribers to cable television systems do not or cannot maintain antennas to receive broadcast television services, do not have input selector switches to convert from a
cable to antenna reception system, or cannot otherwise receive broadcast television services." Ibid. In addition,
Congress concluded that due to "local franchising requirements and the extraordinary expense of constructing more
than one cable television system to serve a particular geographic area," the overwhelming majority of cable operators
exercise a monopoly over cable service. $ 2(a)(2). "The result," Congress determined, "is undue market power for the
cable operator as compared to that of consumers and video
programmers." Ibid.

According to Congress, this market position gives cable
operators the power and the incentive to harm broadcast
competitors. The power derives from the cable operator's
ability, as owner of the transmission facility, to "terminate
the retransmission of the broadcast signal, refuse to carry
new signals, or reposition a broadcast signal to a disadvantageous channel position." $ 2(a)(15). The incentive derives
from the economic reality that "[c]able television systems
and broadcast television stations increasingly compete for
television advertising revenues." $ 2(a)(14). By refusing
carriage of broadcasters' signals, cable operators, as a practical matter, can reduce the number of households that have

634 TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion of the Court
access to the broadcasters' programming, and thereby cap-ture advertising dollars that would otherwise go to broadcast stations. $ 2(a)(15).Congress found, in addition, that increased vertical integration in the cable industry is making it even harder forbroadcasters to secure carriage on cable systems, because
cable operators have a financial incentive to favor their affil-iated programmers. $ 2(a)(5). Congress also determined
that the cable industry is characterized by horizontal concen-tration, with many cable operators sharing common ownership. This has resulted in greater "barriers to entry fornew programmers and a reduction in the number of media
voices available to consumers." $ 2(a)(4).In light of these technological and economic conditions,
Congress concluded that unless cable operators are requiredto carry local broadcast stations, "[t]here is a substantial likelihood that . . . additional local broadcast signals will be de-leted, repositioned, or not carried," $ 2(a)(15); the "marked
shift in market share" from broadcast to cable will continueto erode the advertising revenue base which sustains free
local broadcast television, $$ 2(a)(13)-(14); and that, as a con-sequence, "the economic viability of free local broadcast television and its ability to originate quality local programmingwill be seriously jeopardized," $ 2(a)(16).

Soon after the Act became law, appellants filed these fiveconsolidated actions in the United States District Court for

the District of Columbia against the United States and theFederal Communications Commission (hereinafter referred
to collectively as the Government), challenging the constitu-tionality of the must-carry provisions. Appellants, plaintiffs
below, are numerous cable programmers and cable operators.After additional parties intervened, a three-judge District
Court convened under 28 U. S. C. $ 2284 to hear the actions.1992 Cable Act $ 23, 47 U. S. C. $ 555(c)(1) (1988 ed., Supp.

Opinion of the Court
IV). Each of the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judg-ment; several intervenor-defendants filed cross-motions for

summary judgment; and the Government filed a cross-motionto dismiss. Although the Government had not asked for
summary judgment, the District Court, in a divided opinion,
granted summary judgment in favor of the Government andthe other intervenor-defendants, ruling that the must-carry

provisions are consistent with the First Amendment. 819F. Supp. 32 (1993).

The court found that in enacting the must-carry provi-sions, Congress employed "its regulatory powers over the
economy to impose order upon a market in dysfunction."
Id., at 40. The court characterized the 1992 Cable Act as
"simply industry-specific antitrust and fair trade practice
regulatory legislation," ibid., and said that the must-carry
requirements "are essentially economic regulation designed
to create competitive balance in the video industry as a
whole, and to redress the effects of cable operators' anticompetitive practices," ibid. The court rejected appellants'
contention that the must-carry requirements warrant strict
scrutiny as a content-based regulation, concluding that both
the commercial and public broadcast provisions "are, in intent as well as form, unrelated (in all but the most recondite
sense) to the content of any messages that [the] cable operators, broadcasters, and programmers have in contemplation
to deliver." Ibid. The court proceeded to sustain the
must-carry provisions under the intermediate standard of
scrutiny set forth in United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367
(1968), concluding that the preservation of local broadcasting
is an important governmental interest, and that the mustcarry provisions are sufficiently tailored to serve that interest. 819 F. Supp., at 45-47.

Judge Williams dissented. He acknowledged the "very
real problem" that "cable systems control access `bottlenecks' to an important communications medium," id., at 57,
but concluded that Congress may not address that problem

636 TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion of the Court
by extending access rights only to broadcast television sta-tions. In his view, the must-carry rules are content based,

and thus subject to strict scrutiny, because they requirecable operators to carry speech they might otherwise choose
to exclude, and because Congress' decision to grant favorableaccess to broadcast programmers rested "in part, but quite
explicitly, on a finding about their content." Id., at 58.Applying strict scrutiny, Judge Williams determined that the
interests advanced in support of the law are inadequate tojustify it. While assuming "as an abstract matter" that the
interest in preserving access to free television is compelling,he found "no evidence that this access is in jeopardy."

Id.,at 62. Likewise, he concluded that the rules are insufficiently tailored to the asserted interest in programming di-versity because cable operators "now carry the vast majority
of local stations," and thus to the extent the rules have anyeffect at all, "it will be only to replace the mix chosen by
cablecasters--whose livelihoods depend largely on satisfyingaudience demand--with a mix derived from congressional
dictate." Id., at 61.This direct appeal followed, see $ 23, 47 U. S. C. $ 555(c)(1)
(1988 ed., Supp. IV), and we noted probable jurisdiction.509 U. S. 952 (1993).

There can be no disagreement on an initial premise:Cable programmers and cable operators engage in and transmit speech, and they are entitled to the protection of thespeech and press provisions of the First Amendment.
Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U. S. 439, 444 (1991). Through"original programming or by exercising editorial discretion
over which stations or programs to include in its repertoire,"cable programmers and operators "see[k] to communicate
messages on a wide variety of topics and in a wide varietyof formats." Los Angeles v. Preferred Communications,
Inc., 476 U. S. 488, 494 (1986). By requiring cable systemsto set aside a portion of their channels for local broadcasters,

Opinion of the Court
the must-carry rules regulate cable speech in two respects:The rules reduce the number of channels over which cable

operators exercise unfettered control, and they render itmore difficult for cable programmers to compete for carriage
on the limited channels remaining. Nevertheless, becausenot every interference with speech triggers the same degree
of scrutiny under the First Amendment, we must decide atthe outset the level of scrutiny applicable to the must-carry
provisions. A

We address first the Government's contention that regula-tion of cable television should be analyzed under the same
First Amendment standard that applies to regulation ofbroadcast television. It is true that our cases have permitted more intrusive regulation of broadcast speakers than ofspeakers in other media. Compare

Red Lion Broadcasting
Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367 (1969) (television), and NationalBroadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U. S. 190 (1943)

(radio), with Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418U. S. 241 (1974) (print), and Riley v. National Federation of
Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781 (1988) (personal solicita-tion). But the rationale for applying a less rigorous standard of First Amendment scrutiny to broadcast regulation,whatever its validity in the cases elaborating it, does not
apply in the context of cable regulation.The justification for our distinct approach to broadcast
regulation rests upon the unique physical limitations of thebroadcast medium. See

FCC v. League of Women Voters ofCal., 468 U. S. 364, 377 (1984); Red Lion, supra, at 388-389,

396-399; National Broadcasting Co., 319 U. S., at 226. As ageneral matter, there are more would-be broadcasters than
frequencies available in the electromagnetic spectrum. Andif two broadcasters were to attempt to transmit over the
same frequency in the same locale, they would interfere withone another's signals, so that neither could be heard at all.
Id., at 212. The scarcity of broadcast frequencies thus re512us3$89L 01-08-98 12:42:35 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
quired the establishment of some regulatory mechanism todivide the electromagnetic spectrum and assign specific frequencies to particular broadcasters. See FCC v. League ofWomen Voters, supra, at 377 ("The fundamental distinguishing characteristic of the new medium of broadcasting . . . isthat [b]roadcast frequencies are a scarce resource [that] must
be portioned out among applicants") (internal quotationmarks omitted);

FCC v. National Citizens Comm. forBroadcasting, 436 U. S. 775, 799 (1978). In addition, the inherent physical limitation on the number of speakers whomay use the broadcast medium has been thought to require
some adjustment in traditional First Amendment analysis topermit the Government to place limited content restraints,
and impose certain affirmative obligations, on broadcast li-censees.

Red Lion, 395 U. S., at 390. As we said in RedLion, "[w]here there are substantially more individuals who

want to broadcast than there are frequencies to allocate, itis idle to posit an unabridgeable First Amendment right to
broadcast comparable to the right of every individual tospeak, write, or publish."

Id., at 388; see also ColumbiaBroadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, 412 U. S. 94, 101 (1973).Although courts and commentators have criticized the
scarcity rationale since its inception,5 we have declined toquestion its continuing validity as support for our broadcast
jurisprudence, see FCC v. League of Women Voters, supra,at 376, n. 11, and see no reason to do so here. The broadcast

Opinion of the Court
cases are inapposite in the present context because cabletelevision does not suffer from the inherent limitations that

characterize the broadcast medium. Indeed, given the rapidadvances in fiber optics and digital compression technology,
soon there may be no practical limitation on the number of
speakers who may use the cable medium. Nor is there anydanger of physical interference between two cable speakers

attempting to share the same channel. In light of these fun-damental technological differences between broadcast and
cable transmission, application of the more relaxed standardof scrutiny adopted in

Red Lion and the other broadcast
cases is inapt when determining the First Amendment validity of cable regulation. See Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 74 (1983) ("Our decisions have recognized that the special interest of the Federal Government in
regulation of the broadcast media does not readily translate
into a justification for regulation of other means of communication") (footnote omitted).

This is not to say that the unique physical characteristics
of cable transmission should be ignored when determining
the constitutionality of regulations affecting cable speech.
They should not. See infra, at 656. But whatever relevance these physical characteristics may have in the evaluation of particular cable regulations, they do not require the
alteration of settled principles of our First Amendment
jurisprudence.

Although the Government acknowledges the substantial
technological differences between broadcast and cable, see
Brief for Federal Appellees 22, it advances a second argument for application of the Red Lion framework to cable
regulation. It asserts that the foundation of our broadcast
jurisprudence is not the physical limitations of the electromagnetic spectrum, but rather the "market dysfunction" that
characterizes the broadcast market. Because the cable market is beset by a similar dysfunction, the Government maintains, the Red Lion standard of review should also apply to

512us3$89L 01-08-98 12:42:35 PAGES OPINPGT
640 TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion of the Court
cable. While we agree that the cable market suffers certainstructural impediments, the Government's argument is

flawed in two respects. First, as discussed above, the spe-cial physical characteristics of broadcast transmission, not
the economic characteristics of the broadcast market, are
what underlies our broadcast jurisprudence. See League of
Women Voters, 468 U. S., at 377; National Citizens Comm.
for Broadcasting, supra, at 799; Red Lion, supra, at 390.Second, the mere assertion of dysfunction or failure in a

speech market, without more, is not sufficient to shield aspeech regulation from the First Amendment standards applicable to nonbroadcast media. See, e. g., Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U. S. 652, 657-658 (1990);
Federal Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens for
Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238, 256-259 (1986); Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S., at 248-258.

By a related course of reasoning, the Government and
some appellees maintain that the must-carry provisions are
nothing more than industry-specific antitrust legislation, and
thus warrant rational-basis scrutiny under this Court's
"precedents governing legislative efforts to correct market
failure in a market whose commodity is speech," such as
Associated Press v. United States, 326 U. S. 1 (1945), and
Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342 U. S. 143 (1951).
See Brief for Federal Appellees 17. This contention is unavailing. Associated Press and Lorain Journal both involved actions against members of the press brought under
the Sherman Antitrust Act, a law of general application.
But while the enforcement of a generally applicable law may
or may not be subject to heightened scrutiny under the First
Amendment, compare Cohen v. Cowles Media Co., 501 U. S.
663, 670 (1991), with Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S.
560, 566-567 (1991), laws that single out the press, or certain
elements thereof, for special treatment "pose a particular
danger of abuse by the State," Arkansas Writers' Project,
Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U. S. 221, 228 (1987), and so are always

Opinion of the Court
subject to at least some degree of heightened First Amend-ment scrutiny. See Preferred Communications, 476 U. S.,

at 496 ("Where a law is subjected to a colorable FirstAmendment challenge, the rule of rationality which will sustain legislation against other constitutional challenges typi-cally does not have the same controlling force"). Because
the must-carry provisions impose special obligations uponcable operators and special burdens upon cable programmers, some measure of heightened First Amendment scru-tiny is demanded. See

Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v.Minnesota Comm'r of Revenue, 460 U. S. 575, 583 (1983).

B
At the heart of the First Amendment lies the principlethat each person should decide for himself or herself the

ideas and beliefs deserving of expression, consideration, andadherence. Our political system and cultural life rest upon
this ideal. See Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U. S., at 449 (citing
Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 24 (1971)); West VirginiaBd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 638, 640-642 (1943).

Government action that stifles speech on account of its mes-sage, or that requires the utterance of a particular message
favored by the Government, contravenes this essential right.Laws of this sort pose the inherent risk that the Government
seeks not to advance a legitimate regulatory goal, but to sup-press unpopular ideas or information or manipulate the public debate through coercion rather than persuasion. Theserestrictions "rais[e] the specter that the Government may

414 (1989). Our precedents thus apply the most exacting
scrutiny to regulations that suppress, disadvantage, or impose differential burdens upon speech because of its content.
See Simon & Schuster, 502 U. S., at 115; id., at 125-126
(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment); Perry Ed. Assn. v.
Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 45 (1983). Laws
that compel speakers to utter or distribute speech bearing a
particular message are subject to the same rigorous scrutiny.
See Riley v. National Federation for Blind of N. C., Inc.,
487 U. S., at 798; West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, supra.
In contrast, regulations that are unrelated to the content of
speech are subject to an intermediate level of scrutiny, see
Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S.
288, 293 (1984), because in most cases they pose a less substantial risk of excising certain ideas or viewpoints from the
public dialogue.

Deciding whether a particular regulation is content based
or content neutral is not always a simple task. We have said
that the "principal inquiry in determining content neutrality
. . . is whether the government has adopted a regulation of
speech because of [agreement or] disagreement with the message it conveys." Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S.
781, 791 (1989). See R. A. V., supra, at 386 ("The government may not regulate [speech] based on hostility--or favoritism--towards the underlying message expressed"). The
purpose, or justification, of a regulation will often be evident
on its face. See Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 481 (1988).
But while a content-based purpose may be sufficient in certain circumstances to show that a regulation is content
based, it is not necessary to such a showing in all cases. Cf.
Simon & Schuster, supra, at 117 (" `[I]llicit legislative intent
is not the sine qua non of a violation of the First Amendment' ") (quoting Minneapolis Star & Tribune, supra, at
592). Nor will the mere assertion of a content-neutral purpose be enough to save a law which, on its face, discriminates

based on content. Arkansas Writers' Project, 481 U. S., at231-232; Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 464-469 (1980).

As a general rule, laws that by their terms distinguishfavored speech from disfavored speech on the basis of the
ideas or views expressed are content based. See, e. g., Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 197 (1992) ("Whether individu-als may exercise their free-speech rights near polling places

depends entirely on whether their speech is related to a po-litical campaign"); Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 318-319
(1988) (plurality opinion) (whether municipal ordinance per-mits individuals to "picket in front of a foreign embassy depends entirely upon whether their picket signs are critical ofthe foreign government or not"). By contrast, laws that
confer benefits or impose burdens on speech without refer-ence to the ideas or views expressed are in most instances
content neutral. See, e. g., Members of City Council of Los
Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S. 789, 804 (1984)(ordinance prohibiting the posting of signs on public property

Opinion of the Court
ators' editorial discretion by compelling them to offer carriage to a certain minimum number of broadcast stations,
the extent of the interference does not depend upon the content of the cable operators' programming. The rules impose
obligations upon all operators, save those with fewer than
300 subscribers, regardless of the programs or stations they
now offer or have offered in the past. Nothing in the Act
imposes a restriction, penalty, or burden by reason of the
views, programs, or stations the cable operator has selected
or will select. The number of channels a cable operator
must set aside depends only on the operator's channel capacity, see 47 U. S. C. $$ 534(b)(1), 535(b)(2)-(3) (1988 ed., Supp.
IV); hence, an operator cannot avoid or mitigate its obligations under the Act by altering the programming it offers
to subscribers. Cf. Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S., at 256-257 (newspaper may avoid access
obligations by refraining from speech critical of political
candidates).

tions because of the geographic distance of such full power stations from
the low power station's community of license." $ 534(h)(2)(B). We recognize that this aspect of $ 4 appears to single out certain low-power broadcasters for special benefits on the basis of content. Because the District
Court did not address whether these particular provisions are content
based, and because the parties make only the most glancing reference to
the operation of, and justifications for, the low-power broadcast provisions,
we think it prudent to allow the District Court to consider the contentneutral or content-based character of this provision in the first instance
on remand.

In a similar vein, although a broadcast station's eligibility for must-carry
is based upon its geographic proximity to a qualifying cable system,

$ 534(h)(1)(C)(i), the Act permits the FCC to grant must-carry privileges
upon request to otherwise ineligible broadcast stations. In acting upon
these requests, the FCC is directed to give "attention to the value
of localism" and, in particular, to whether the requesting station "provides news coverage of issues of concern to such community . . . or
coverage of sporting and other events of interest to the community."

$ 534(h)(1)(C)(ii). Again, the District Court did not address this provision, but may do so on remand.

Opinion of the Court
The must-carry provisions also burden cable programmersby reducing the number of channels for which they can compete. But, again, this burden is unrelated to content, for itextends to all cable programmers irrespective of the programming they choose to offer viewers. Cf. Boos, supra, at
319 (individuals may picket in front of a foreign embassyso long as their picket signs are not critical of the foreign

government). And finally, the privileges conferred by themust-carry provisions are also unrelated to content. The
rules benefit all full power broadcasters who request car-riage--be they commercial or noncommercial, independent
or network affiliated, English or Spanish language, religious
or secular. The aggregate effect of the rules is thus to make
every full power commercial and noncommercial broadcaster
eligible for must-carry, provided only that the broadcaster
operates within the same television market as a cable
system.

It is true that the must-carry provisions distinguish between speakers in the television programming market. But
they do so based only upon the manner in which speakers
transmit their messages to viewers, and not upon the messages they carry: Broadcasters, which transmit over the
airwaves, are favored, while cable programmers, which do
not, are disfavored. Cable operators, too, are burdened
by the carriage obligations, but only because they control
access to the cable conduit. So long as they are not a subtle
means of exercising a content preference, speaker distinctions of this nature are not presumed invalid under the
First Amendment.

That the must-carry provisions, on their face, do not burden or benefit speech of a particular content does not end the
inquiry. Our cases have recognized that even a regulation
neutral on its face may be content based if its manifest purpose is to regulate speech because of the message it conveys.

Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 534-535 (1993).

Appellants contend, in this regard, that the must-carryregulations are content based because Congress' purpose in

enacting them was to promote speech of a favored content.We do not agree. Our review of the Act and its various
findings persuades us that Congress' overriding objective in
enacting must-carry was not to favor programming of a particular subject matter, viewpoint, or format, but rather to
preserve access to free television programming for the 40
percent of Americans without cable.

In unusually detailed statutory findings, supra, at 632-634,
Congress explained that because cable systems and broadcast stations compete for local advertising revenue,

$$ 2(a)(14)-(15), and because cable operators have a vested
financial interest in favoring their affiliated programmers
over broadcast stations, $ 2(a)(5), cable operators have a
built-in "economic incentive . . . to delete, reposition, or not
carry local broadcast signals," $ 2(a)(16). Congress concluded that absent a requirement that cable systems carry
the signals of local broadcast stations, the continued availability of free local broadcast television would be threatened.
Ibid. Congress sought to avoid the elimination of broadcast
television because, in its words, "[s]uch programming is . . .
free to those who own television sets and do not require
cable transmission to receive broadcast television signals,"

$ 2(a)(12), and because "[t]here is a substantial governmental
interest in promoting the continued availability of such free
television programming, especially for viewers who are
unable to afford other means of receiving programming,"
ibid.

Opinion of the Court
By preventing cable operators from refusing carriage to
broadcast television stations, the must-carry rules ensure
that broadcast television stations will retain a large enough
potential audience to earn necessary advertising revenue--
or, in the case of noncommercial broadcasters, sufficient
viewer contributions, see $ 2(a)(8)(B)--to maintain their continued operation. In so doing, the provisions are designed
to guarantee the survival of a medium that has become a
vital part of the Nation's communication system, and to ensure that every individual with a television set can obtain
access to free television programming.

This overriding congressional purpose is unrelated to the
content of expression disseminated by cable and broadcast
speakers. Indeed, our precedents have held that "protecting noncable households from loss of regular television
broadcasting service due to competition from cable systems,"
is not only a permissible governmental justification, but
an "important and substantial federal interest." Capital
Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U. S. 691, 714 (1984); see also
United States v. Midwest Video Corp., 406 U. S. 649, 661-662,
664 (1972) (plurality opinion).

The design and operation of the challenged provisions confirm that the purposes underlying the enactment of the
must-carry scheme are unrelated to the content of speech.
The rules, as mentioned, confer must-carry rights on all full
power broadcasters, irrespective of the content of their programming. They do not require or prohibit the carriage of
particular ideas or points of view. They do not penalize
cable operators or programmers because of the content of
their programming. They do not compel cable operators to
affirm points of view with which they disagree. They do not
produce any net decrease in the amount of available speech.
And they leave cable operators free to carry whatever programming they wish on all channels not subject to mustcarry requirements.

648 TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion of the Court
Appellants and Justice O'Connor make much of the factthat, in the course of describing the purposes behind the Act,

Congress referred to the value of broadcast programming.In particular, Congress noted that broadcast television is "an
important source of local news[,] public affairs programming
and other local broadcast services critical to an informedelectorate," $ 2(a)(11); see also $ 2(a)(10), and that noncommercial television "provides educational and informationalprogramming to the Nation's citizens," $ 2(a)(8). We do not
think, however, that such references cast any material doubton the content-neutral character of must-carry. That Congress acknowledged the local orientation of broadcast programming and the role that noncommercial stations have
played in educating the public does not indicate that Congress regarded broadcast programming as more valuable
than cable programming. Rather, it reflects nothing more
than the recognition that the services provided by broadcast
television have some intrinsic value and, thus, are worth
preserving against the threats posed by cable. See 819
F. Supp., at 44 ("Congress' solicitousness for local broadcasters' material simply rests on its assumption that they have
as much to say of interest or value as the cable programmers
who service a given geographic market audience").

The operation of the Act further undermines the suggestion that Congress' purpose in enacting must-carry was to
force programming of a "local" or "educational" content on
cable subscribers. The provisions, as we have stated, benefit all full power broadcasters irrespective of the nature of
their programming. In fact, if a cable system were required
to bump a cable programmer to make room for a broadcast
station, nothing would stop a cable operator from displacing
a cable station that provides all local- or education-oriented
programming with a broadcaster that provides very little.
Appellants do not even contend, moreover, that broadcast
programming is any more "local" or "educational" than cable
programming. Cf. Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U. S., at 449

649Cite as: 512 U. S. 622 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
(state law imposing tax upon cable television, but exemptingother media, is not content based, in part due to lack of evidence that cable programming "differs systematically in itsmessage from that communicated by satellite broadcast programming, newspapers, or magazines").In short, Congress' acknowledgment that broadcast television stations make a valuable contribution to the Nation'scommunications system does not render the must-carry
scheme content based. The scope and operation of the chal-lenged provisions make clear, in our view, that Congress designed the must-carry provisions not to promote speech of aparticular content, but to prevent cable operators from exploiting their economic power to the detriment of broadcast-ers, and thereby to ensure that all Americans, especially
those unable to subscribe to cable, have access to free televi-sion programming--whatever its content.

We likewise reject the suggestion, advanced by appellantsand by Judge Williams in dissent, that the must-carry rules
are content based because the preference for broadcast stations "automatically entails content requirements." 819F. Supp., at 58. It is true that broadcast programming, unlike cable programming, is subject to certain limited contentrestraints imposed by statute and FCC regulation.

7 But it

does not follow that Congress mandated cable carriage of
broadcast television stations as a means of ensuring that par7 See, e. g., 47 U. S. C. $ 303b (1988 ed., Supp. IV) (directing FCC to consider extent to which license renewal applicant has "served the educational

Opinion of the Court
ticular programs will be shown, or not shown, on cablesystems.

As an initial matter, the argument exaggerates the extentto which the FCC is permitted to intrude into matters affecting the content of broadcast programming. The FCC is forbidden by statute to engage in "censorship" or to promulgateany regulation "which shall interfere with the [broadcasters'] right of free speech." 47 U. S. C. $ 326. The FCC iswell aware of the limited nature of its jurisdiction, having acknowledged that it "has no authority and, in fact, isbarred by the First Amendment and [$ 326] from interfering
with the free exercise of journalistic judgment." Hubbard Broadcasting, Inc., 48 F. C. C. 2d 517, 520 (1974).
In particular, the FCC's oversight responsibilities do not
grant it the power to ordain any particular type of programming that must be offered by broadcast stations; for although
"the Commission may inquire of licensees what they have
done to determine the needs of the community they propose
to serve, the Commission may not impose upon them its private notions of what the public ought to hear." Network

Stations licensed to broadcast over the special frequencies
reserved for "noncommercial educational" stations are
subject to no more intrusive content regulation than their
commercial counterparts. Noncommercial licensees must
operate on a nonprofit basis, may not accept financial consideration in exchange for particular programming, and may not
broadcast promotional announcements or advertisements on
behalf of for-profit entities. 47 CFR $$ 73.621(d)-(e) (1993);
see generally Public Broadcasting, 98 F. C. C. 2d 746, 751

Opinion of the Court
(1982), modified, 97 F. C. C. 2d 255 (1984). What is impor-tant for present purposes, however, is that noncommercial

licensees are not required by statute or regulation to carryany specific quantity of "educational" programming or any
particular "educational" programs. Noncommercial licensees, like their commercial counterparts, need only adhere tothe general requirement that their programming serve "the

public interest, convenience or necessity." En Banc Programming Inquiry, 44 F. C. C. 2d 2303, 2312 (1960). The
FCC itself has recognized that "a more rigorous standard forpublic stations would come unnecessarily close to impinging

on First Amendment rights and would run the collateral risk
of stifling the creativity and innovative potential of these stations." Public Broadcasting, supra, at 751; see also Public
Radio and TV Programming, 87 F. C. C. 2d 716, 728-729,
732, |||| 29-30, 37 (1981); Georgia State Bd. of Ed., 70
F. C. C. 2d 948 (1979).

In addition, although federal funding provided through the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) supports programming on noncommercial stations, the Government is
foreclosed from using its financial support to gain leverage
over any programming decisions. See 47 U. S. C. $ 396(g)
(1)(D) (directing CPB to "carry out its purposes and functions
and engage in its activities in ways that will most effectively
assure the maximum freedom of the public telecommunications entities and systems from interference with, or control
of, program content or other activities"), $ 398(a) (CPB operates without interference from any department, agency, or
officer of the Federal Government, including the FCC).

Indeed, our cases have recognized that Government regulation over the content of broadcast programming must be
narrow, and that broadcast licensees must retain abundant
discretion over programming choices. See FCC v. League
of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U. S., at 378-380, 386-392 (invalidating under the First Amendment statute forbidding
any noncommercial educational station that receives a grant

from the CPB to "engage in editorializing"); Columbia
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, 412 U. S., at 126 (describing "the risk of an enlargement
of Government control over the content of broadcast discussion of public issues" as being of "critical importance" to the
First Amendment). Thus, given the minimal extent to
which the FCC and Congress actually influence the programming offered by broadcast stations, it would be difficult to
conclude that Congress enacted must-carry in an effort to
exercise content control over what subscribers view on cable
television. In a regime where Congress or the FCC exercised more intrusive control over the content of broadcast
programming, an argument similar to appellants' might
carry greater weight. But in the present regulatory system, those concerns are without foundation.

In short, the must-carry provisions are not designed to
favor or disadvantage speech of any particular content.
Rather, they are meant to protect broadcast television from
what Congress determined to be unfair competition by cable
systems. In enacting the provisions, Congress sought to
preserve the existing structure of the Nation's broadcast
television medium while permitting the concomitant expansion and development of cable television, and, in particular,
to ensure that broadcast television remains available as
a source of video programming for those without cable.
Appellants' ability to hypothesize a content-based purpose
for these provisions rests on little more than speculation
and does not cast doubt upon the content-neutral character
of must-carry. Cf. Arizona v. California, 283 U. S. 423,
455-457 (1931). Indeed, "[i]t is a familiar principle of constitutional law that this Court will not strike down an otherwise constitutional statute on the basis of an alleged illicit
legislative motive." United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S.,
at 383 (citing McCray v. United States, 195 U. S. 27, 56
(1904)).

Opinion of the Court

D
Appellants advance three additional arguments to support
their view that the must-carry provisions warrant strict
scrutiny. In brief, appellants contend that the provisions (1)
compel speech by cable operators, (2) favor broadcast programmers over cable programmers, and (3) single out certain
members of the press for disfavored treatment. None of
these arguments suffices to require strict scrutiny in the
present case.

1

Appellants maintain that the must-carry provisions trigger strict scrutiny because they compel cable operators to
transmit speech not of their choosing. Relying principally
on Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241
(1974), appellants say this intrusion on the editorial control
of cable operators amounts to forced speech which, if not
per se invalid, can be justified only if narrowly tailored to a
compelling government interest.

Tornillo affirmed an essential proposition: The First
Amendment protects the editorial independence of the press.
The right-of-reply statute at issue in Tornillo required any
newspaper that assailed a political candidate's character to
print, upon request by the candidate and without cost, the
candidate's reply in equal space and prominence. Although
the statute did not censor speech in the traditional sense--
it only required newspapers to grant access to the messages
of others--we found that it imposed an impermissible
content-based burden on newspaper speech. Because the
right of access at issue in Tornillo was triggered only when
a newspaper elected to print matter critical of political candidates, it "exact[ed] a penalty on the basis of . . . content."
Id., at 256. We found, and continue to recognize, that rightof-reply statutes of this sort are an impermissible intrusion
on newspapers' "editorial control and judgment." Id., at
258.

654 TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion of the Court
We explained that, in practical effect, Florida's right-ofreply statute would deter newspapers from speaking in unfavorable terms about political candidates:

"Faced with the penalties that would accrue to any
newspaper that published news or commentary arguably
within the reach of the right-of-access statute, editors
might well conclude that the safe course is to avoid controversy. Therefore, under the operation of the Florida statute, political and electoral coverage would be
blunted or reduced." Id., at 257.

Moreover, by affording mandatory access to speakers with
which the newspaper disagreed, the law induced the newspaper to respond to the candidates' replies when it might
have preferred to remain silent. See Pacific Gas & Elec.
Co. v. Public Util. Comm'n of Cal., 475 U. S. 1, 11 (1986)
(plurality opinion).

The same principles led us to invalidate a similar contentbased access regulation in Pacific Gas & Electric. At issue
was a rule requiring a privately owned utility, on a quarterly
basis, to include with its monthly bills an editorial newsletter
published by a consumer group critical of the utility's ratemaking practices. Although the access requirement applicable to the utility, unlike the statutory mechanism in Tornillo, was not triggered by speech of any particular content,
the plurality held that the same strict First Amendment
scrutiny applied. Like the statute in Tornillo, the regulation conferred benefits to speakers based on viewpoint, giving access only to a consumer group opposing the utility's
practices. 475 U. S., at 13, 15. The plurality observed that
in order to avoid the appearance that it agreed with the
group's views, the utility would "feel compelled to respond
to arguments and allegations made by [the group] in its messages to [the utility's] customers." Id., at 16. This "kind of
forced response," the plurality explained, "is antithetical to

Opinion of the Court
the free discussion that the First Amendment seeks to fos-ter."

Ibid.
Tornillo and Pacific Gas & Electric do not control thiscase for the following reasons. First, unlike the access rules

struck down in those cases, the must-carry rules are content
neutral in application. They are not activated by any partic-ular message spoken by cable operators and thus exact no

content-based penalty. Cf. Riley v. National Federation of
Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S., at 795 (solicitation of funds
triggers requirement to express government-favored mes-sage). Likewise, they do not grant access to broadcasters

on the ground that the content of broadcast programming
will counterbalance the messages of cable operators. Instead, they confer benefits upon all full-power, local broadcasters, whatever the content of their programming. Cf.
Pacific Gas & Electric, supra, at 14 (access "awarded only
to those who disagree with appellant's views and who are
hostile to appellant's interests").

Second, appellants do not suggest, nor do we think it the
case, that must-carry will force cable operators to alter their
own messages to respond to the broadcast programming
they are required to carry. See Brenner, Cable Television
and the Freedom of Expression, 1988 Duke L. J., at 379
("Other than adding new ideas--offensive, insightful or tedious--the [speaker granted access to cable] does not influence an operator's agenda"). Given cable's long history of
serving as a conduit for broadcast signals, there appears little risk that cable viewers would assume that the broadcast
stations carried on a cable system convey ideas or messages
endorsed by the cable operator. Indeed, broadcasters are
required by federal regulation to identify themselves at least
once every hour, 47 CFR $ 73.1201 (1993), and it is a common
practice for broadcasters to disclaim any identity of viewpoint between the management and the speakers who use
the broadcast facility. Cf. PruneYard Shopping Center v.
Robins, 447 U. S. 74, 87 (1980) (noting that the views ex512us3$89L 01-08-98 12:42:35 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
pressed by speakers who are granted a right of access to ashopping center would "not likely be identified with those of

the owner"). Moreover, in contrast to the statute at issuein Tornillo, no aspect of the must-carry provisions would
cause a cable operator or cable programmer to conclude that"the safe course is to avoid controversy,"

Tornillo, 418 U. S.,at 257, and by so doing diminish the free flow of information

and ideas.Finally, the asserted analogy to Tornillo ignores an important technological difference between newspapers and cabletelevision. Although a daily newspaper and a cable operator
both may enjoy monopoly status in a given locale, the cableoperator exercises far greater control over access to the relevant medium. A daily newspaper, no matter how secure itslocal monopoly, does not possess the power to obstruct readers' access to other competing publications--whether theybe weekly local newspapers, or daily newspapers published
in other cities. Thus, when a newspaper asserts exclusivecontrol over its own news copy, it does not thereby prevent
other newspapers from being distributed to willing recipi-ents in the same locale.

The same is not true of cable. When an individual sub-scribes to cable, the physical connection between the television set and the cable network gives the cable operator bot-tleneck, or gatekeeper, control over most (if not all) of the
television programming that is channeled into the subscrib-er's home. Hence, simply by virtue of its ownership of the
essential pathway for cable speech, a cable operator can pre-vent its subscribers from obtaining access to programming
it chooses to exclude. A cable operator, unlike speakers inother media, can thus silence the voice of competing speakers
with a mere flick of the switch.8

8 As one commentator has observed: "The central dilemma of cable is
that it has unlimited capacity to accommodate as much diversity and as
many publishers as print, yet all of the producers and publishers use the
same physical plant. . . . If the cable system is itself a publisher, it may

Opinion of the Court
The potential for abuse of this private power over a centralavenue of communication cannot be overlooked. See Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U. S. 546, 557 (1975)("Each medium of expression . . . must be assessed for First
Amendment purposes by standards suited to it, for each maypresent its own problems"). The First Amendment's command that government not impede the freedom of speechdoes not disable the government from taking steps to ensure
that private interests not restrict, through physical controlof a critical pathway of communication, the free flow of information and ideas. See Associated Press v. United States,326 U. S., at 20. We thus reject appellants' contention that
Tornillo and Pacific Gas & Electric require strict scrutinyof the access rules in question here.

2
Second, appellants urge us to apply strict scrutiny becausethe must-carry provisions favor one set of speakers (broadcast programmers) over another (cable programmers). Ap-pellants maintain that as a consequence of this speaker preference, some cable programmers who would have securedcarriage in the absence of must-carry may now be dropped.
Relying on language in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976),appellants contend that such a regulation is presumed invalid
under the First Amendment because the government maynot "restrict the speech of some elements of our society in
order to enhance the relative voice of others." Id., at 48-49.To the extent appellants' argument rests on the view that
all regulations distinguishing between speakers warrantstrict scrutiny, see Brief for Appellants Turner Broadcasting
System, Inc., et al. 29, it is mistaken. At issue in Buckleywas a federal law prohibiting individuals from spending more
than $1,000 per year to support or oppose a particular politi-cal candidate. The Government justified the law as a means

restrict the circumstances under which it allows others also to use its
system." I. de Sola Pool, Technologies of Freedom 168 (1983).

Opinion of the Court
of "equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groupsto influence the outcome of elections."

Buckley, 424 U. S.,
at 48. We rejected that argument with the observation thatCongress may not "abridge the rights of some persons to

engage in political expression in order to enhance the relative voice of other segments of our society." Id., at 49, n. 55.Our holding in

Buckley does not support appellants' broad
assertion that all speaker-partial laws are presumed invalid.Rather, it stands for the proposition that speaker-based laws

demand strict scrutiny when they reflect the Government'spreference for the substance of what the favored speakers
have to say (or aversion to what the disfavored speakers
have to say). See Regan v. Taxation with Representation
of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 548 (1983) (rejecting First Amendment challenge to differential tax treatment of veterans
groups and other charitable organizations, but noting that
the case would be different were there any "indication that
the statute was intended to suppress any ideas or any demonstration that it has had that effect"). Because the expenditure limit in Buckley was designed to ensure that the political speech of the wealthy not drown out the speech of others,
we found that it was concerned with the communicative impact of the regulated speech. See Buckley, supra, at 17
("[I]t is beyond dispute that the interest in regulating the
. . . giving or spending [of] money `arises in some measure
because the communication . . . is itself thought to be harmful' ") (quoting United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S., at 382).
Indeed, were the expenditure limitation unrelated to the content of expression, there would have been no perceived need
for Congress to "equaliz[e] the relative ability" of interested
individuals to influence elections. 424 U. S., at 48. Buckley
thus stands for the proposition that laws favoring some
speakers over others demand strict scrutiny when the legislature's speaker preference reflects a content preference.

The question here is whether Congress preferred broadcasters over cable programmers based on the content of pro512us3$89L 01-08-98 12:42:36 PAGES OPINPGT

659Cite as: 512 U. S. 622 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
gramming each group offers. The answer, as we explained,supra, at 643-652, is no. Congress granted must-carry privileges to broadcast stations on the belief that the broadcasttelevision industry is in economic peril due to the physical
characteristics of cable transmission and the economic incen-tives facing the cable industry. Thus, the fact that the provisions benefit broadcasters and not cable programmers doesnot call for strict scrutiny under our precedents.

3
Finally, appellants maintain that strict scrutiny applies be-cause the must-carry provisions single out certain members

of the press--here, cable operators--for disfavored treat-ment. See,

e. g., Brief for Appellant Time Warner Enter-tainment Co. 28-30. In support, appellants point out that

Congress has required cable operators to provide carriageto broadcast stations, but has not imposed like burdens on
analogous video delivery systems, such as multichannelmultipoint distribution (MMDS) systems and satellite master
antenna television (SMATV) systems. Relying upon ourprecedents invalidating discriminatory taxation of the press,
see, e. g., Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481U. S. 221 (1987);

Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'r of Revenue, 460 U. S. 575 (1983); Grosjean v.American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233 (1936), appellants contend

that this sort of differential treatment poses a particulardanger of abuse by the Government and should be presumed invalid.Regulations that discriminate among media, or among different speakers within a single medium, often present seri-ous First Amendment concerns.

Minneapolis Star, for ex-ample, considered a use tax imposed on the paper and ink

used in the production of newspapers. We subjected the taxto strict scrutiny for two reasons: first, because it applied
only to the press; and, second, because in practical applica-tion it fell upon only a small number of newspapers. Minne512us3$89L 01-08-98 12:42:36 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
apolis Star, supra, at 585, 591-592; see also Grosjean, supra(invalidating Louisiana tax on publications with weekly circulations above 20,000, which fell on 13 of the approximately135 newspapers distributed in the State). The sales tax at
issue in Arkansas Writers' Project, which applied to general
interest magazines but exempted religious, professional,trade, and sports magazines, along with all newspapers, suffered the second of these infirmities. In operation, the taxwas levied upon a limited number of publishers and also discriminated on the basis of subject matter. Arkansas Writers' Project, supra, at 229-230. Relying in part on Minneapolis Star, we held that this selective taxation of the press
warranted strict scrutiny. 481 U. S., at 231.

It would be error to conclude, however, that the First
Amendment mandates strict scrutiny for any speech regulation that applies to one medium (or a subset thereof) but
not others. In Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U. S. 439 (1991), for
example, we upheld against First Amendment challenge the
application of a general state tax to cable television services,
even though the print media and scrambled satellite broadcast television services were exempted from taxation. As
Leathers illustrates, the fact that a law singles out a certain
medium, or even the press as a whole, "is insufficient by itself
to raise First Amendment concerns." Id., at 452. Rather,
laws of this nature are "constitutionally suspect only in certain circumstances." Id., at 444. The taxes invalidated in
Minneapolis Star and Arkansas Writers' Project, for example, targeted a small number of speakers, and thus threatened to "distort the market for ideas." 499 U. S., at 448.
Although there was no evidence that an illicit governmental
motive was behind either of the taxes, both were structured
in a manner that raised suspicions that their objective was,
in fact, the suppression of certain ideas. See Arkansas
Writers' Project, supra, at 228-229; Minneapolis Star, 460
U. S., at 585. But such heightened scrutiny is unwarranted
when the differential treatment is "justified by some special

Opinion of the Court
characteristic of " the particular medium being regulated.Ibid.

The must-carry provisions, as we have explained above,are justified by special characteristics of the cable medium:
the bottleneck monopoly power exercised by cable operatorsand the dangers this power poses to the viability of broadcast television. Appellants do not argue, nor does it appear,that other media--in particular, media that transmit video
programming such as MMDS and SMATV--are subject tobottleneck monopoly control, or pose a demonstrable threat
to the survival of broadcast television. It should come as nosurprise, then, that Congress decided to impose the mustcarry obligations upon cable operators only.In addition, the must-carry provisions are not structured
in a manner that carries the inherent risk of underminingFirst Amendment interests. The regulations are broad
based, applying to almost all cable systems in the country,rather than just a select few. See 47 U. S. C. $ 534(b)(1)
(1988 ed., Supp. IV) (only cable systems with fewer than 300subscribers exempted from must-carry). As a result, the
provisions do not pose the same dangers of suppression andmanipulation that were posed by the more narrowly targeted
regulations in Minneapolis Star and Arkansas Writers'
Project. For these reasons, the must-carry rules do not callfor strict scrutiny. See Leathers, supra, at 449, 453 (upholding state sales tax which applied to about 100 cable systems"offering a wide variety of programming" because the tax
was not "likely to stifle the free exchange of ideas" and posedno "danger of suppress[ion]").

III

A

In sum, the must-carry provisions do not pose such inher-ent dangers to free expression, or present such potential for

censorship or manipulation, as to justify application of themost exacting level of First Amendment scrutiny. We agree

512us3$89L 01-08-98 12:42:36 PAGES OPINPGT
662 TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion of the Court
with the District Court that the appropriate standard bywhich to evaluate the constitutionality of must-carry is the

intermediate level of scrutiny applicable to content-neutralrestrictions that impose an incidental burden on speech.
See Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781 (1989);
United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968).Under

O'Brien, a content-neutral regulation will be sustained if

"it furthers an important or substantial governmentalinterest; if the governmental interest is unrelated to the

suppression of free expression; and if the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is nogreater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest." Id., at 377.
To satisfy this standard, a regulation need not be the least
speech-restrictive means of advancing the Government's in-terests. "Rather, the requirement of narrow tailoring is

satisfied `so long as the . . . regulation promotes a substantialgovernment interest that would be achieved less effectively
absent the regulation.' " Ward, supra, at 799 (quoting
United States v. Albertini, 472 U. S. 675, 689 (1985)). Narrow tailoring in this context requires, in other words, thatthe means chosen do not "burden substantially more speech

than is necessary to further the government's legitimate interests." Ward, supra, at 799.Congress declared that the must-carry provisions serve

three interrelated interests: (1) preserving the benefits offree, over-the-air local broadcast television, (2) promoting the
widespread dissemination of information from a multiplicity
of sources, and (3) promoting fair competition in the market
for television programming. S. Rep. No. 102-92, p. 58
(1991); H. R. Rep. No. 102-628, p. 63 (1992); 1992 Cable Act,

$$ 2(a)(8), (9), and (10). None of these interests is related to
the "suppression of free expression," O'Brien, 391 U. S., at
377, or to the content of any speakers' messages. And

Opinion of the Court
viewed in the abstract, we have no difficulty concluding thateach of them is an important governmental interest.

Ibid.
In the Communications Act of 1934, Congress created asystem of free broadcast service and directed that communications facilities be licensed across the country in a "fair,
efficient, and equitable" manner. Communications Act of1934, $ 307(b), 48 Stat. 1083, 47 U. S. C. $ 307(b). Congress

designed this system of allocation to afford each communityof appreciable size an over-the-air source of information and
an outlet for exchange on matters of local concern. United
States v. Southwestern Cable Co., 392 U. S. 157, 173-174
(1968); Wollenberg, The FCC as Arbiter of "The Public Interest, Convenience, and Necessity," in A Legislative History of the Communications Act of 1934, pp. 61, 62-70 (M.
Paglin ed. 1989). As we recognized in Southwestern Cable,
supra, the importance of local broadcasting outlets "can
scarcely be exaggerated, for broadcasting is demonstrably a
principal source of information and entertainment for a great
part of the Nation's population." Id., at 177. The interest
in maintaining the local broadcasting structure does not
evaporate simply because cable has come upon the scene.
Although cable and other technologies have ushered in alternatives to broadcast television, nearly 40 percent of American households still rely on broadcast stations as their exclusive source of television programming. And as we said in
Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, "protecting noncable
households from loss of regular television broadcasting service due to competition from cable systems" is an important
federal interest. 467 U. S., at 714.

Likewise, assuring that the public has access to a multiplicity of information sources is a governmental purpose of
the highest order, for it promotes values central to the First
Amendment. Indeed, " `it has long been a basic tenet of
national communications policy that "the widest possible
dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic
sources is essential to the welfare of the public." ' " United

Broadcasting, 436 U. S. 775, 795 (1978). Finally, the Gov-ernment's interest in eliminating restraints on fair competition is always substantial, even when the individuals orentities subject to particular regulations are engaged in expressive activity protected by the First Amendment. See
Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342 U. S. 143 (1951);Associated Press v. United States, supra; cf. FTC v. Superior Court Trial Lawyers Assn., 493 U. S. 411, 431-432(1990).

B
That the Government's asserted interests are important inthe abstract does not mean, however, that the must-carry

rules will in fact advance those interests. When the Gov-ernment defends a regulation on speech as a means to redress past harms or prevent anticipated harms, it must domore than simply "posit the existence of the disease sought
to be cured." Quincy Cable TV, Inc. v. FCC, 768 F. 2d 1434,1455 (CADC 1985). It must demonstrate that the recited
harms are real, not merely conjectural, and that the regula-tion will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material
way. See Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 770-771 (1993);
Los Angeles v. Preferred Communications, Inc., 476 U. S.,at 496 ("This Court may not simply assume that the ordinance will always advance the asserted state interests suffi-ciently to justify its abridgment of expressive activity") (internal quotation marks omitted); Home Box Office, Inc. v.
FCC, 567 F. 2d 9, 36 (CADC 1977) ("[A] `regulation perfectlyreasonable and appropriate in the face of a given problem

may be highly capricious if that problem does not exist' ")(citation omitted).

Thus, in applying O'Brien scrutiny we must ask firstwhether the Government has adequately shown that the eco512us3$89L 01-08-98 12:42:36 PAGES OPINPGT

665Cite as: 512 U. S. 622 (1994)
Opinion of Kennedy, J.
nomic health of local broadcasting is in genuine jeopardy andin need of the protections afforded by must-carry. Assuming an affirmative answer to the foregoing question, the Gov-ernment still bears the burden of showing that the remedy
it has adopted does not "burden substantially more speech
than is necessary to further the government's legitimate in-terests."

Ward, 491 U. S., at 799. On the state of the record developed thus far, and in the absence of findings of factfrom the District Court, we are unable to conclude that the

Government has satisfied either inquiry.In defending the factual necessity for must-carry, the Government relies in principal part on Congress' legislative
finding that, absent mandatory carriage rules, the continued
viability of local broadcast television would be "seriously
jeopardized." $ 2(a)(16). See Brief for Federal Appellees
31-32. The Government contends that this finding, though
predictive in nature, must be accorded great weight in the
First Amendment inquiry, especially when, as here, Congress has sought to "address the relationship between two
technical, rapidly changing, and closely interdependent industries--broadcasting and cable." Id., at 30.

We agree that courts must accord substantial deference to
the predictive judgments of Congress. See, e. g., Columbia
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, 412 U. S., at 103 (The "judgment of the Legislative
Branch" should not be ignored "simply because [appellants]
cas[t] [their] claims under the umbrella of the First Amendment"). Sound policymaking often requires legislators to
forecast future events and to anticipate the likely impact of
these events based on deductions and inferences for which
complete empirical support may be unavailable. See FCC
v. National Citizens Comm. for Broadcasting, supra, at 814;
FPC v. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., 365 U. S. 1,
29 (1961). As an institution, moreover, Congress is far better equipped than the judiciary to "amass and evaluate the
vast amounts of data" bearing upon an issue as complex and

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
dynamic as that presented here. Walters v. National Assn.
of Radiation Survivors, 473 U. S. 305, 331, n. 12 (1985).
And Congress is not obligated, when enacting its statutes, tomake a record of the type that an administrative agency or

court does to accommodate judicial review.

That Congress' predictive judgments are entitled to sub-stantial deference does not mean, however, that they are insulated from meaningful judicial review altogether. On thecontrary, we have stressed in First Amendment cases that
the deference afforded to legislative findings does "not fore-close our independent judgment of the facts bearing on an
issue of constitutional law." Sable Communications of Cal.,
Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 129 (1989); see also Landmark
Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U. S. 829, 843 (1978).
This obligation to exercise independent judgment when First
Amendment rights are implicated is not a license to reweigh
the evidence de novo, or to replace Congress' factual predictions with our own. Rather, it is to assure that, in formulating its judgments, Congress has drawn reasonable inferences
based on substantial evidence. See Century Communications Corp. v. FCC, 835 F. 2d 292, 304 (CADC 1987) ("[W]hen
trenching on first amendment interests, even incidentally,
the government must be able to adduce either empirical support or at least sound reasoning on behalf of its measures").

The Government's assertion that the must-carry rules are
necessary to protect the viability of broadcast television
rests on two essential propositions: (1) that unless cable operators are compelled to carry broadcast stations, significant
numbers of broadcast stations will be refused carriage on
cable systems; and (2) that the broadcast stations denied carriage will either deteriorate to a substantial degree or fail
altogether.

As support for the first proposition, the Government relies
upon a 1988 FCC study showing, at a time when no mustcarry rules were in effect, that approximately 20 percent of
cable systems reported dropping or refusing carriage to one

or more local broadcast stations on at least one occasion.See Cable System Broadcast Signal Carriage Survey, Staff

Report by the Policy and Rules Division, Mass MediaBureau, p. 10 (Sept. 1, 1988) (Table 2), cited in S. Rep.
No. 102-92, at 42-43. The record does not indicate, however, the time frame within which these drops occurred, orhow many of these stations were dropped for only a temporary period and then restored to carriage. The same FCCstudy indicates that about 23 percent of the cable operators
reported shifting the channel positions of one or more localbroadcast stations, and that, in most cases, the repositioning
was done for "marketing" rather than "technical" reasons.
Id., at 44 (citing Signal Carriage Survey, supra, at 19, 22
(Tables 10 and 13)).

The parties disagree about the significance of these statistics. But even if one accepts them as evidence that a large
number of broadcast stations would be dropped or repositioned in the absence of must-carry, the Government must
further demonstrate that broadcasters so affected would suffer financial difficulties as a result. Without a more substantial elaboration in the District Court of the predictive or
historical evidence upon which Congress relied, or the introduction of some additional evidence to establish that the
dropped or repositioned broadcasters would be at serious
risk of financial difficulty, we cannot determine whether the
threat to broadcast television is real enough to overcome the
challenge to the provisions made by these appellants. We
think it significant, for instance, that the parties have not
presented any evidence that local broadcast stations have
fallen into bankruptcy, turned in their broadcast licenses,
curtailed their broadcast operations, or suffered a serious
reduction in operating revenues as a result of their being
dropped from, or otherwise disadvantaged by, cable systems.

The paucity of evidence indicating that broadcast television is in jeopardy is not the only deficiency in this record.
Also lacking are any findings concerning the actual effects of

668 TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
must-carry on the speech of cable operators and cable pro-grammers--

i. e., the extent to which cable operators will, in
fact, be forced to make changes in their current or antici-pated programming selections; the degree to which cable

programmers will be dropped from cable systems to make
room for local broadcasters; and the extent to which cableoperators can satisfy their must-carry obligations by devoting previously unused channel capacity to the carriage oflocal broadcasters. The answers to these and perhaps other
questions are critical to the narrow tailoring step of the
O'Brien analysis, for unless we know the extent to which the
must-carry provisions in fact interfere with protectedspeech, we cannot say whether they suppress "substantially

more speech than . . . necessary" to ensure the viability of
broadcast television. Ward, 491 U. S., at 799. Finally, the
record fails to provide any judicial findings concerning the
availability and efficacy of "constitutionally acceptable less
restrictive means" of achieving the Government's asserted
interests. See Sable Communications, supra, at 129.

In sum, because there are genuine issues of material fact
still to be resolved on this record, we hold that the District
Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the
Government. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477
U. S. 242, 250 (1986). Because of the unresolved factual
questions, the importance of the issues to the broadcast and
cable industries, and the conflicting conclusions that the parties contend are to be drawn from the statistics and other
evidence presented, we think it necessary to permit the parties to develop a more thorough factual record, and to allow
the District Court to resolve any factual disputes remaining,
before passing upon the constitutional validity of the challenged provisions.

The judgment below is vacated, and the case is remanded
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Justice Blackmun, concurring.
I join Justice Kennedy's opinion, which aptly identifiesand analyzes the First Amendment concerns and principles

that should guide consideration of free speech issues in theexpanding cable industry. I write to emphasize the paramount importance of according substantial deference to thepredictive judgments of Congress, see,

e. g., Columbia
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Commit-tee, 412 U. S. 94, 103 (1973), particularly where, as here, that

legislative body has compiled an extensive record in thecourse of reaching its judgment. Nonetheless, the standard
for summary judgment is high, and no less so when FirstAmendment values are at stake and the issue is of farreaching importance. Because in this case there remain afew unresolved issues of material fact, a remand is appropriate. The Government had occasion to submit to the Dis-trict Court only portions of the record developed by Congress. In light of the Court's opinion today, those portions,which were submitted to defeat a motion for summary judgment, are not adequate to support one. The record beforethe District Court no doubt will benefit from any additional
evidence the Government and the other parties now see fitto present.

Justice Stevens, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.
As Justice Kennedy has ably explained, the "overriding
congressional purpose" of the challenged must-carry provi-sions of the 1992 Cable Act is to "guarantee the survival

of a medium that has become a vital part of the Nation's
communication system," a purpose that is "unrelated to thecontent of expression."

Ante, at 647. The public interests
in protecting access to television for the millions of homeswithout cable and in assuring the availability of "a multiplicity of information sources" are unquestionably substantial.
Ante, at 663. The must-carry provisions are amply "justi512us3$89I 01-08-98 12:42:36 PAGES OPINPGT

fied by special characteristics of the cable medium," namely,"the bottleneck monopoly power exercised by cable operators and the dangers this power poses to the viability ofbroadcast television." Ante, at 661. Cable operators' control of essential facilities provides a basis for intrusive regu-lation that would be inappropriate and perhaps impermissible for other communicative media.While I agree with most of

Justice Kennedy's reasoning,and join Parts I, II-C, II-D, and III-A of his opinion, I part

ways with him on the appropriate disposition of this case.In my view the District Court's judgment sustaining the
must-carry provisions should be affirmed. The DistrictCourt majority evaluated $$ 4 and 5 as content-neutral regulations of protected speech according to the same standardthat

Justice Kennedy's opinion instructs it to apply on re-mand. In my view, the District Court reached the correct

result the first time around. Economic measures are alwayssubject to second-guessing; they rest on inevitably provisional and uncertain forecasts about the future effect of legalrules in complex conditions. Whether Congress might have
accomplished its goals more efficiently through other means;
whether it correctly interpreted emerging trends in the pro-tean communications industry; and indeed whether mustcarry is actually imprudent as a matter of policy will remainmatters of debate long after the 1992 Act has been repealed
or replaced by successor legislation. But the question for usis merely whether

Congress could fairly conclude that cable
operators' monopoly position threatens the continued viability of broadcast television and that must-carry is an appro-priate means of minimizing that risk.

1 I have no quarrel with Justice Kennedy's general statement that the
question for the reviewing court in a case of this kind is merely whether

to a formal record in the manner required of a judicial or administrative

Opinion of Stevens, J.
As Justice Kennedy recognizes, ante, at 665-666, findings by the Congress, particularly those emerging from such
sustained deliberations, merit special respect from this
Court.2 Accorded proper deference, the findings in $ 2 are
sufficient to sustain the must-carry provisions against facial
attack. Congress' conclusion, for example, that broadcasters who are denied carriage on cable systems will suffer serious and potentially terminal economic harm, see $ 2(a)(16),
requires no "further demonstration." See ante, at 667. Because 60% of American households have cable, and because
most cable subscribers rely solely on that medium to receive
video signals, it is a practical certainty that a broadcaster
dropped from the local cable system would suffer substantial
economic harm. It is also clear that cable operators--particularly (but not exclusively) those affiliated with cable programmers--have both the ability and the economic incentive
to exploit their gatekeeper status to the detriment of broadcasters. Thus, even if Congress had had before it no historical evidence that terminations or refusals of carriage had
already occurred,3 it could reasonably infer that cable operators' bottleneck control, together with the already high degree of vertical integration in the industry, would motivate

factfinder. Ante, at 666. In my view, however, application of that standard would require affirmance here.

2 As Justice Kennedy observes, ibid., we cannot abdicate our responsibility to decide whether a restriction on speech violates the First Amendment. But the factual findings accompanying economic measures that are
enacted by Congress itself and that have only incidental effects on speech
merit greater deference than those supporting content-based restrictions
on speech, see Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115,
129 (1989); Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U. S. 829,
843 (1978) (both cited ante, at 666), or restrictions imposed by administrative agencies, see, e. g., Century Communications Corp. v. FCC, 835 F. 2d

such conduct in the near future.4 Indeed, the main thrustof the most pertinent congressional findings is not that cable

carriers have already eliminated broadcast competition on agrand scale, but that given their market power they may
soon do so.5An industry need not be in its death throes before Congress may act to protect it from economic harm threatenedby a monopoly. The mandatory access mechanism that Congress fashioned in $$ 4 and 5 of the 1992 Act is a simple anddirect means of dealing with the dangers posed by cable operators' exclusive control of what is fast becoming the preem-inent means of transferring video signals to homes. The
must-carry mechanism is analogous to the relief that mightbe appropriate for a threatened violation of the antitrust
laws; one need only refer to undisputed facts concerning thestructure of the cable and broadcast industries to agree that
that threat is at least plausible. Moreover, Congress did nothave to find that all broadcasters were at risk before acting
to protect vulnerable ones, for the interest in preserving ac4 As Judge Jackson put it in his opinion for the District Court:
"[E]ven if the state of the broadcasting industry is not now as parlous as
the defendants contend, the Court finds it to be indisputable on this record
that cable operators have attained a position of dominance in the video
signal distribution market, and can henceforth exercise the attendant market power. The Court does not find improbable Congress' conclusion that
this market power provides cable operators with both incentive and present ability to block non-cable programmers' access to the bulk of any prospective viewing audience; unconstrained, cable holds the future of local
broadcasting at its mercy. In light of the considerable body of evidence
amassed by Congress, and the deference this Court should accord to the
factfinding abilities of the nation's legislature, the Court must conclude
that the danger perceived by Congress is real and substantial." 819

5 See $ 2(a)(16) ("As a result of the economic incentive that cable systems

have to delete, reposition, or not carry local broadcast signals, . . . the
economic viability of free local broadcast television and its ability to originate quality local programming will be seriously jeopardized"); see also

cess to free television is valid throughout the Nation. In-deed, the Act is well tailored to assist those broadcasters

who are most in jeopardy. Because thriving commercialbroadcasters will likely avail themselves of the remunerative
"retransmission consent" procedure of $ 6, those broadcasters
who gain access via the $ 4 must-carry route are apt to bethe most economically vulnerable ones. Precisely how often

broadcasters will secure carriage through $ 6 rather than $ 4will depend upon future developments; the very unpredictability of this and other effects of the new regulatory schememilitates in favor of allowing the scheme to proceed rather
than requiring a perfectly documented or entirely complete
ex ante justification.

Justice Kennedy asks the three-judge panel to take additional evidence on such matters as whether the must-carryprovisions really respond to threatened harms to broadcasters, whether $$ 4-5 "will in fact alleviate these harms in a
direct and material way," ante, at 664, and "the extent to
which cable operators will, in fact, be forced to make changes
in their current or anticipated programming selections,"
ante, at 668. While additional evidence might cast further
light on the efficacy and wisdom of the must-carry provisions, additional evidence is not necessary to resolve the
question of their facial constitutionality.6

To predicate the facial validity of the must-carry provisions upon forecasts of the ultimate consequences of their
implementation is to ask the District Court to address questions that are not at present susceptible of reliable answers.
Some of the matters the lead opinion singles out for further

6 The must-carry obligations may be broader than necessary to protect
vulnerable broadcasters, but that would not alone be enough to demonstrate that they violate the First Amendment. Thus, for instance, to the
extent that $$ 4 and 5 obligate cable operators to carry broadcasters they
would have carried even in the absence of a statutory obligation, any impairment of operators' freedom of choice, or on cable programmers' ability
to secure carriage, would be negligible.

review--for example, "the degree to which cable program-mers will be dropped from cable systems to make room for

local broadcasters," ibid.--depend upon predictions aboutthe future voluntary actions of entities who are parties to
this case. At best, a remand for consideration of such factors will require the District Court to engage in speculation;it may actually invite the parties to adjust their conduct in

an effort to affect the result of this litigation (perhaps byopting to drop cable programs rather than seeking to increase total channel capacity). The must-carry provisionsmay ultimately prove an ineffective or needlessly meddlesome means of achieving Congress' legitimate goals. How-ever, such a conclusion could be confidently drawn, if ever,
only after the must-carry scheme has been tested by experience. On its face, that scheme is rationally calculated to redress the dangers that Congress discerned after its lengthy
investigation of the relationship between the cable and
broadcasting industries.

It is thus my view that we should affirm the judgment of
the District Court. Were I to vote to affirm, however, no
disposition of this appeal would command the support of a
majority of the Court. An accommodation is therefore necessary. See Screws v. United States, 325 U. S. 91, 134 (1945)
(Rutledge, J., concurring in result). Accordingly, because I
am in substantial agreement with Justice Kennedy's analysis of the case, I concur in the judgment vacating and remanding for further proceedings.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of
1992, Pub. L. 102-385, 106 Stat. 1460, Congress made a
choice: By reserving a little over one-third of the channels
on a cable system for broadcasters, it ensured that in most
cases it will be a cable programmer who is dropped and a
broadcaster who is retained. The question presented in this
case is whether this choice comports with the commands of
the First Amendment.

I

A

The 1992 Cable Act implicates the First Amendment
rights of two classes of speakers. First, it tells cable operators which programmers they must carry, and keeps cable
operators from carrying others that they might prefer.
Though cable operators do not actually originate most of the
programming they show, the Court correctly holds that they
are, for First Amendment purposes, speakers. Ante, at 636.
Selecting which speech to retransmit is, as we know from
the example of publishing houses, movie theaters, bookstores, and Reader's Digest, no less communication than is
creating the speech in the first place.

Second, the Act deprives a certain class of video programmers--those who operate cable channels rather than broadcast stations--of access to over one-third of an entire medium. Cable programmers may compete only for those
channels that are not set aside by the must-carry provisions.
A cable programmer that might otherwise have been carried
may well be denied access in favor of a broadcaster that is
less appealing to the viewers but is favored by the mustcarry rules. It is as if the Government ordered all movie
theaters to reserve at least one-third of their screening for
films made by American production companies, or required
all bookstores to devote one-third of their shelf space to nonprofit publishers. As the Court explains in Parts I, II-A,
and II-B of its opinion, which I join, cable programmers and

676 TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
operators stand in the same position under the First Amend-ment as do the more traditional media.

Under the First Amendment, it is normally not within thegovernment's power to decide who may speak and who may
not, at least on private property or in traditional public fora.
The government does have the power to impose content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions, but this is in

large part precisely because such restrictions apply to allspeakers. Laws that treat all speakers equally are relatively poor tools for controlling public debate, and their verygenerality creates a substantial political check that prevents
them from being unduly burdensome. Laws that single out
particular speakers are substantially more dangerous, even
when they do not draw explicit content distinctions. See,
e. g., Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'r
of Revenue, 460 U. S. 575, 584, 591-592 (1983); see also Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U. S. 439, 447 (1991).

I agree with the Court that some speaker-based restrictions--those genuinely justified without reference to content--need not be subject to strict scrutiny. But looking at
the statute at issue, I cannot avoid the conclusion that its
preference for broadcasters over cable programmers is justified with reference to content. The findings, enacted by
Congress as $ 2 of the Act, and which I must assume state
the justifications for the law, make this clear. "There is a
substantial governmental and First Amendment interest in
promoting a diversity of views provided through multiple
technology media." $ 2(a)(6). "[P]ublic television provides
educational and informational programming to the Nation's
citizens, thereby advancing the Government's compelling interest in educating its citizens." $ 2(a)(8)(A). "A primary
objective and benefit of our Nation's system of regulation of
television broadcasting is the local origination of programming. There is a substantial governmental interest in ensuring its continuation." $ 2(a)(10). "Broadcast television
stations continue to be an important source of local news and

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
public affairs programming and other local broadcast serv-ices critical to an informed electorate." $ 2(a)(11).

Similar justifications are reflected in the operative provi-sions of the Act. In determining whether a broadcast station should be eligible for must-carry in a particular market,
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) must "af-ford particular attention to the value of localism by taking

into account such factors as . . . whether any other [eligiblestation] provides news coverage of issues of concern to such
community or provides carriage or coverage of sporting andother events of interest to the community." $ 4, 47 U. S. C.

$ 534(h)(1)(C)(ii) (1988 ed., Supp. IV). In determining
whether a low-power station is eligible for must-carry, the
FCC must ask whether the station "would address local
news and informational needs which are not being adequately served by full power television broadcast stations."

$ 4, 47 U. S. C. $ 534(h)(2)(B) (1988 ed., Supp. IV). Moreover,
the Act distinguishes between commercial television stations
and noncommercial educational television stations, giving
special benefits to the latter. Compare $ 4 with $ 5. These
provisions may all be technically severable from the statute, but they are still strong evidence of the statute's
justifications.

Preferences for diversity of viewpoints, for localism, for
educational programming, and for news and public affairs all
make reference to content. They may not reflect hostility
to particular points of view, or a desire to suppress certain
subjects because they are controversial or offensive. They
may be quite benignly motivated. But benign motivation,
we have consistently held, is not enough to avoid the need
for strict scrutiny of content-based justifications. Simon &
Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd.,
502 U. S. 105, 117 (1991); Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v.
Ragland, 481 U. S. 221, 228 (1987). The First Amendment
does more than just bar government from intentionally suppressing speech of which it disapproves. It also generally

678 TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
prohibits the government from excepting certain kinds ofspeech from regulation because it thinks the speech is especially valuable. See, e. g., id., at 231-232; Regan v. Time,Inc., 468 U. S. 641, 648-649 (1984); Metromedia, Inc. v. San
Diego, 453 U. S. 490, 514-515 (1981) (plurality opinion); Careyv.

Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 466-468 (1980); Police Dept. of Chi-cago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 96 (1972); Cox v. Louisiana, 379

U. S. 536, 581 (1965) (Black, J., concurring); see also R. A. V.v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 386 (1992) ("The government may
not regulate [speech] based on hostility--or favoritism--towards the underlying message expressed").

This is why the Court is mistaken in concluding that theinterest in diversity--in "access to a multiplicity" of "diverse
and antagonistic sources," ante, at 663 (internal quotationmarks omitted)--is content neutral. Indeed, the interest is
not "related to the suppression of free expression," ante, at662 (emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted),
but that is not enough for content neutrality. The interestin giving a tax break to religious, sports, or professional
magazines, see Arkansas Writers' Project, supra, is not re-lated to the suppression of speech; the interest in giving
labor picketers an exemption from a general picketing ban,see Carey and Mosley, supra, is not related to the suppression of speech. But they are both related to the content ofspeech--to its communicative impact. The interest in ensuring access to a multiplicity of diverse and antagonisticsources of information, no matter how praiseworthy, is directly tied to the content of what the speakers will likely say.

B
The Court dismisses the findings quoted above by specu-lating that they do not reveal a preference for certain kinds

of content; rather, the Court suggests, the findings show"nothing more than the recognition that the services provided by broadcast television have some intrinsic value and,thus, are worth preserving against the threats posed by

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
cable." Ante, at 648. I cannot agree. It is rare enoughthat Congress states, in the body of the statute itself, the

findings underlying its decision. When it does, it is fair toassume that those findings reflect the basis for the legislative
decision, especially when the thrust of the findings is further
reflected in the rest of the statute. See Church of Lukumi
Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 534-535 (1993)
(relying on recitals in a city council resolution as evidence ofthe justifications for an ordinance).

Moreover, it does not seem likely that Congress wouldmake extensive findings merely to show that broadcast television is valuable. The controversial judgment at the heart
of the statute is not that broadcast television has some
value--obviously it does--but that broadcasters should be
preferred over cable programmers. The best explanation
for the findings, it seems to me, is that they represent Congress' reasons for adopting this preference; and, according
to the findings, these reasons rest in part on the content of
broadcasters' speech. To say in the face of the findings that
the must-carry rules "impose burdens and confer benefits
without reference to the content of speech," ante, at 643,
cannot be correct, especially in light of the care with which
we must normally approach speaker-based restrictions.
See Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'r
of Revenue, 460 U. S. 575 (1983).

It may well be that Congress also had other, contentneutral, purposes in mind when enacting the statute. But
we have never held that the presence of a permissible justification lessens the impropriety of relying in part on an
impermissible justification. In fact, we have often struck
down statutes as being impermissibly content based even
though their primary purpose was indubitably content neutral. See Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc., supra (striking
down content-based exemptions in a general revenue measure); Regan v. Time, Inc., supra (striking down contentbased exemptions in a general anticounterfeiting statute);

680 TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, supra (plurality opinion)(striking down on content discrimination grounds a general

urban beautification ordinance); Carey v. Brown, supra, at466-468 (striking down on content discrimination grounds
an ordinance aimed at preserving residential privacy). Ofcourse, the mere possibility that a statute might be justified
with reference to content is not enough to make the statutecontent based, and neither is evidence that some legislators
voted for the statute for content-based reasons. But whena content-based justification appears on the statute's face, we
cannot ignore it because another, content-neutral justifica-tion is present.

C
Content-based speech restrictions are generally unconsti-tutional unless they are narrowly tailored to a compelling

state interest. Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 321 (1988).This is an exacting test. It is not enough that the goals of
the law be legitimate, or reasonable, or even praiseworthy.There must be some pressing public necessity, some essential
value that has to be preserved; and even then the law mustrestrict as little speech as possible to serve the goal.

The interest in localism, either in the dissemination ofopinions held by the listeners' neighbors or in the reporting
of events that have to do with the local community, cannotbe described as "compelling" for the purposes of the compelling state interest test. It is a legitimate interest, perhapseven an important one--certainly the government can foster
it by, for instance, providing subsidies from the public fisc--but it does not rise to the level necessary to justify contentbased speech restrictions. It is for private speakers and lis-teners, not for the government, to decide what fraction of
their news and entertainment ought to be of a local characterand what fraction ought to be of a national (or international)
one. And the same is true of the interest in diversity ofviewpoints: While the government may subsidize speakers
that it thinks provide novel points of view, it may not restrict

681Cite as: 512 U. S. 622 (1994)

other speakers on the theory that what they say is moreconventional. Cf.

Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497
U. S. 547, 612-613 (1990) (O'Connor, J., dissenting); Pacific
Gas & Elec. Co. v. Public Util. Comm'n of Cal., 475 U. S. 1,
20 (1986) (plurality opinion).

The interests in public affairs programming and educa-tional programming seem somewhat weightier, though it is

a difficult question whether they are compelling enough tojustify restricting other sorts of speech. We have never
held that the Government could impose educational contentrequirements on, say, newsstands, bookstores, or movie theaters; and it is not clear that such requirements would in any
event appreciably further the goals of public education.

But even assuming, arguendo, that the Government could
set some channels aside for educational or news programming, the Act is insufficiently tailored to this goal. To benefit the educational broadcasters, the Act burdens more than
just the cable entertainment programmers. It equally burdens CNN, C-SPAN, the Discovery Channel, the New Inspirational Network, and other channels with as much claim as
PBS to being educational or related to public affairs.

Even if the Government can restrict entertainment in
order to benefit supposedly more valuable speech, I do not
think the restriction can extend to other speech that is as
valuable as the speech being benefited. In the rare circumstances where the government may draw content-based distinctions to serve its goals, the restrictions must serve the
goals a good deal more precisely than this. See Arkansas
Writers' Project, Inc., 481 U. S., at 231-232; Erznoznik v.
Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205, 214-215 (1975).

Finally, my conclusion that the must-carry rules are content based leads me to conclude that they are an impermissible restraint on the cable operators' editorial discretion as
well as on the cable programmers' speech. For reasons related to the content of speech, the rules restrict the ability
of cable operators to put on the programming they prefer,

682 TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC. v. FCC

and require them to include programming they would ratheravoid. This, it seems to me, puts this case squarely within

the rule of Pacific Gas & Elec. Co., 475 U. S., at 14-15 (plural-ity opinion); id., at 23-24 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment); see also Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo,418 U. S. 241, 257-258 (1974).

II
Even if I am mistaken about the must-carry provisionsbeing content based, however, in my view they fail contentneutral scrutiny as well. Assuming, arguendo, that the pro-visions are justified with reference to the content-neutral
interests in fair competition and preservation of free televi-sion, they nonetheless restrict too much speech that does not
implicate these interests.Sometimes, a cable system's choice to carry a cable programmer rather than a broadcaster may be motivated byanticompetitive impulses, or might lead to the broadcaster
going out of business. See ante, at 661-668. That somespeech within a broad category causes harm, however, does
not justify restricting the whole category. If Congresswants to protect those stations that are in danger of going
out of business, or bar cable operators from preferring pro-grammers in which the operators have an ownership stake,
it may do that. But it may not, in the course of advancingthese interests, restrict cable operators and programmers in
circumstances where neither of these interests is threatened."A regulation is not `narrowly tailored'--even under the
more lenient [standard applicable to content-neutral restric-tions]--where . . . a substantial portion of the burden on
speech does not serve to advance [the State's content-neutral] goals." Simon & Schuster, 502 U. S., at 122, n. (internal quotation marks omitted). If the government wantsto avoid littering, it may ban littering, but it may not ban all
leafleting. Schneider v. State (Town of Irvington), 308 U. S.147 (1939). If the government wants to avoid fraudulent po512us3$89J 01-08-98 12:42:36 PAGES OPINPGT

683Cite as: 512 U. S. 622 (1994)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
litical fundraising, it may bar the fraud, but it may not inthe process prohibit legitimate fundraising. Schaumburg v.

Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U. S. 620 (1980); seealso Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 776-777 (1993). If the
government wants to protect householders from unwantedsolicitors, it may enforce "No Soliciting" signs that the
householders put up, but it may not cut off access to homeswhose residents are willing to hear what the solicitors have
to say. Martin v. City of Struthers, 319 U. S. 141 (1943)."Broad prophylactic rules in the area of free expression
are suspect. Precision of regulation must be the touch-stone . . . ."

NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 438 (1963)(citations omitted).

The must-carry provisions are fatally overbroad, evenunder a content-neutral analysis: They disadvantage cable
programmers even if the operator has no anticompetitive mo-tives, and even if the broadcaster that would have to be
dropped to make room for the cable programmer would sur-vive without cable access. None of the factfinding that the
District Court is asked to do on remand will change this.The Court does not suggest that either the antitrust interest
or the loss of free television interest are implicated in all, oreven most, of the situations in which must-carry makes a
difference. Perhaps on remand the District Court will findout just how many broadcasters will be jeopardized, but the
remedy for this jeopardy will remain the same: Protect thosebroadcasters that are put in danger of bankruptcy, without
unnecessarily restricting cable programmers in marketswhere free broadcasting will thrive in any event.

III
Having said all this, it is important to acknowledge onebasic fact: The question is not whether there will be control

over who gets to speak over cable--the question is who willhave this control. Under the FCC's view, the answer is
Congress, acting within relatively broad limits. Under my

684 TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
view, the answer is the cable operator. Most of the time,the cable operator's decision will be largely dictated by the

preferences of the viewers; but because many cable opera-tors are indeed monopolists, the viewers' preferences will
not always prevail. Our recognition that cable operators
are speakers is bottomed in large part on the very fact thatthe cable operator has editorial discretion.

Ante, at 636-637.
I have no doubt that there is danger in having a singlecable operator decide what millions of subscribers can or cannot watch. And I have no doubt that Congress can act torelieve this danger. In other provisions of the Act, Congress has already taken steps to foster competition among
cable systems. $ 3(a), 47 U. S. C. $ 543(a)(2) (1988 ed., Supp.
IV). Congress can encourage the creation of new media,
such as inexpensive satellite broadcasting, or fiber-optic networks with virtually unlimited channels, or even simple devices that would let people easily switch from cable to overthe-air broadcasting. And of course Congress can subsidize
broadcasters that it thinks provide especially valuable
programming.

Congress may also be able to act in more mandatory ways.
If Congress finds that cable operators are leaving some channels empty--perhaps for ease of future expansion--it can
compel the operators to make the free channels available to
programmers who otherwise would not get carriage. See
PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U. S. 74, 88
(1980) (upholding a compelled access scheme because it did
not burden others' speech). Congress might also conceivably obligate cable operators to act as common carriers for
some of their channels, with those channels being open to all
through some sort of lottery system or time-sharing arrangement. Setting aside any possible Takings Clause issues, it
stands to reason that if Congress may demand that telephone
companies operate as common carriers, it can ask the same
of cable companies; such an approach would not suffer from
the defect of preferring one speaker to another.

But the First Amendment as we understand it today restson the premise that it is government power, rather than private power, that is the main threat to free expression; andas a consequence, the Amendment imposes substantial limitations on the Government even when it is trying to serve
concededly praiseworthy goals. Perhaps Congress can tosome extent restrict, even in a content-based manner, the

speech of cable operators and cable programmers. But itmust do so in compliance with the constitutional requirements, requirements that were not complied with here. Ac-cordingly, I would reverse the judgment below.

Justice Ginsburg, concurring in part and dissenting inpart.
Substantially for the reasons stated by Circuit Judge Williams in his opinion dissenting from the three-judge District
Court's judgment, 819 F. Supp. 32, 57 (DC 1993), I conclude
that Congress' "must-carry" regime, which requires cable operators to set aside just over one-third of their channels for
local broadcast stations, reflects an unwarranted contentbased preference and hypothesizes a risk to local stations
that remains imaginary. I therefore concur in Parts I, II-A,
and II-B of the Court's opinion, and join Justice O'Connor's opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.

The "must-carry" rules Congress has ordered do not differentiate on the basis of "viewpoint," and therefore do not
fall in the category of speech regulation that Government
must avoid most assiduously. See R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505
U. S. 377, 430 (1992) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment)
("[W]e have implicitly distinguished between restrictions on
expression based on subject matter and restrictions based on
viewpoint, indicating that the latter are particularly pernicious."). The rules, however, do reflect a content preference, and on that account demand close scrutiny.

The Court has identified as Congress' "overriding objective in enacting must-carry," the preservation of over-the-air

television service for those unwilling or unable to subscribeto cable, and has remanded the case for further airing centered on that allegedly overriding, content-neutral purpose.Ante, at 646-648, 666-668. But an intertwined or even discrete content-neutral justification does not render specula-tive, or reduce to harmless surplus, Congress' evident plan to
advance local programming. See ante, at 676-677, 679-680(

O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).As Circuit Judge Williams stated:

"Congress rested its decision to promote [local broad-cast] stations in part, but quite explicitly, on a finding
about their content--that they were `an importantsource of local news and public affairs programming and
other local broadcast services critical to an informedelectorate.' " 819 F. Supp., at 58, quoting Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992,$ 2(a)(11).

Moreover, as Judge Williams persuasively explained, "[the]facts do not support an inference that over-the-air TV is at
risk," 819 F. Supp., at 63, see id., at 62-65; "[w]hatever riskthere may be in the abstract has completely failed to materialize." Id., at 63. "The paucity of evidence indicating thatbroadcast television is in jeopardy," see

BOARD OF EDUCATION OF KIRYAS JOEL VIL-LAGE SCHOOL DISTRICT

v. GRUMET

certiorari to the court of appeals of new york

No. 93-517. Argued March 30, 1994--Decided June 27, 1994*
The New York village of Kiryas Joel is a religious enclave of Satmar Hasidim, practitioners of a strict form of Judaism. Its incorporators intentionally drew its boundaries under the State's general village incorporation law to exclude all but Satmars. The village fell within the
Monroe-Woodbury Central School District until a special state statute,
1989 N. Y. Laws, ch. 748, carved out a separate district that follows
village lines. Although the statute gives a locally elected school board
plenary authority over primary and secondary education in the village,
the board currently runs only a special education program for handicapped children; other village children attend private religious schools,
which do not offer special educational services. Shortly before the new
district began operations, respondents and others brought this action
claiming, inter alia, that Chapter 748 violates the Establishment Clause
of the First Amendment. The state trial court granted summary judgment for respondents, and both the intermediate appellate court and the
New York Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling that Chapter 748's primary
effect was impermissibly to advance religion.

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
81 N. Y. 2d 518, 618 N. E. 2d 94, affirmed.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court with respect
to Parts II-B, II-C, and III, concluding that Chapter 748 violates the
Establishment Clause. Pp. 702-710.

(a) Because the Kiryas Joel Village School District did not receive its
new governmental authority simply as one of many communities eligible
for equal treatment under a general law, there is no assurance that the
next religious community seeking a school district of its own will receive
one. The anomalously case-specific creation of this district for a religious community leaves the Court without any way to review such state
action for the purpose of safeguarding the principle that government
should not prefer one religion to another, or religion to irreligion. Nor
can the historical context furnish any reason to suppose that the Sat*Together with No. 93-527, Board of Education of Monroe-Woodbury

mars are merely one in a series of similarly benefited communities, the
special Act in these cases being entirely at odds with New York's historical trend. Pp. 702-705.

(b) Although the Constitution allows the State to accommodate religious needs by alleviating special burdens, Chapter 748 crosses the
line from permissible accommodation to impermissible establishment.
There are, however, several alternatives for providing bilingual and
bicultural special education to Satmar children that do not implicate
the Establishment Clause. The Monroe-Woodbury school district could
offer an educationally appropriate program at one of its public schools
or at a neutral site near one of the village's parochial schools, and if
the state legislature should remain dissatisfied with the local district's
responsiveness, it could enact general legislation tightening the mandate
to school districts on matters of special education or bilingual and bicultural offerings. Pp. 705-708.

Justice Souter, joined by Justice Blackmun, Justice Stevens,
and Justice Ginsburg, concluded in Part II-A that by delegating the
State's discretionary authority over public schools to a group defined by
its common religion, Chapter 748 brings about an impermissible "fusion"
of governmental and religious functions. See Larkin v. Grendel's Den,
Inc., 459 U. S. 116, 126, 127. That a religious criterion was the defining
test is shown by the legislature's undisputed knowledge that the village
was exclusively Satmar when the statute was adopted; by the fact that
the creation of such a small and specialized school district ran uniquely
counter to customary districting practices in the State; and by the district's origin in a special and unusual legislative Act rather than the
State's general laws for school district organization. The result is that
the legislature has delegated civic authority on the basis of religious
belief rather than on neutral principles. Pp. 696-702.

Justice Kennedy, agreeing that the Kiryas Joel Village School District violates the Establishment Clause, concluded that the school district's real vice is that New York created it by drawing political boundaries on the basis of religion. See, e. g., Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630,
648-649. There is more than a fine line between the voluntary association that leads to a political community comprised of people who share
a common religious faith, and the forced separation that occurs when
the government draws explicit political boundaries on the basis of peoples' faith. In creating the district in question, New York crossed that
line. Pp. 728-730.

SCHOOL DIST. v. GRUMET

Opinion of the Court

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court,except as to Parts II (introduction) and II-A.

The village of Kiryas Joel in Orange County, New York, isa religious enclave of Satmar Hasidim, practitioners of a
strict form of Judaism. The village fell within the Monroe-Woodbury Central School District until a special state statute passed in 1989 carved out a separate district, followingvillage lines, to serve this distinctive population. 1989 N. Y.
Laws, ch. 748. The question is whether the Act creating theseparate school district violates the Establishment Clause
of the First Amendment, binding on the States through theFourteenth Amendment. Because this unusual Act is tantamount to an allocation of political power on a religious crite-rion and neither presupposes nor requires governmental
impartiality toward religion, we hold that it violates the pro-hibition against establishment.

Opinion of the Court
Rebbe and most of his surviving followers moved to the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, New York. Then, 20 years
ago, the Satmars purchased an approved but undeveloped
subdivision in the town of Monroe and began assembling the
community that has since become the village of Kiryas Joel.
When a zoning dispute arose in the course of settlement, the
Satmars presented the Town Board of Monroe with a petition to form a new village within the town, a right that New
York's Village Law gives almost any group of residents who
satisfy certain procedural niceties. See N. Y. Village Law,
Art. 2 (McKinney 1973 and Supp. 1994). Neighbors who did
not wish to secede with the Satmars objected strenuously,
and after arduous negotiations the proposed boundaries of
the village of Kiryas Joel were drawn to include just the 320
acres owned and inhabited entirely by Satmars. The village, incorporated in 1977, has a population of about 8,500
today. Rabbi Aaron Teitelbaum, eldest son of the current
Grand Rebbe, serves as the village rov (chief rabbi) and rosh
yeshivah (chief authority in the parochial schools).

The residents of Kiryas Joel are vigorously religious people who make few concessions to the modern world and go
to great lengths to avoid assimilation into it. They interpret
the Torah strictly; segregate the sexes outside the home;
speak Yiddish as their primary language; eschew television,
radio, and English-language publications; and dress in distinctive ways that include headcoverings and special garments for boys and modest dresses for girls. Children are
educated in private religious schools, most boys at the
United Talmudic Academy where they receive a thorough
grounding in the Torah and limited exposure to secular subjects, and most girls at Bais Rochel, an affiliated school with
a curriculum designed to prepare girls for their roles as
wives and mothers. See generally W. Kephart & W. Zellner,
Extraordinary Groups (4th ed. 1991); I. Rubin, Satmar, An
Island in the City (1972).

SCHOOL DIST. v. GRUMET

Opinion of the Court

These schools do not, however, offer any distinctive serv-ices to handicapped children, who are entitled under state

and federal law to special education services even whenenrolled in private schools. Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act, 20 U. S. C. $ 1400 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp.
IV); N. Y. Educ. Law, Art. 89 (McKinney 1981 and Supp.1994). Starting in 1984 the Monroe-Woodbury Central

School District provided such services for the children ofKiryas Joel at an annex to Bais Rochel, but a year later
ended that arrangement in response to our decisions in
Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402 (1985), and School Dist. of
Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373 (1985). Children from
Kiryas Joel who needed special education (including the deaf,
the mentally retarded, and others suffering from a range of
physical, mental, or emotional disorders) were then forced to
attend public schools outside the village, which their families
found highly unsatisfactory. Parents of most of these children withdrew them from the Monroe-Woodbury secular
schools, citing "the panic, fear and trauma [the children] suffered in leaving their own community and being with people
whose ways were so different," and some sought administrative review of the public-school placements. Board of Ed.
of Monroe-Woodbury Central School Dist. v. Wieder, 72
N. Y. 2d 174, 180-181, 527 N. E. 2d 767, 770 (1988).

Monroe-Woodbury, for its part, sought a declaratory judgment in state court that New York law barred the district
from providing special education services outside the district's regular public schools. Id., at 180, 527 N. E. 2d, at
770. The New York Court of Appeals disagreed, holding
that state law left Monroe-Woodbury free to establish a separate school in the village because it gives educational authorities broad discretion in fashioning an appropriate program.
Id., at 186-187, 527 N. E. 2d, at 773. The court added, however, that the Satmars' constitutional right to exercise their
religion freely did not require a separate school, since the
parents had alleged emotional trauma, not inconsistency

with religious practice or doctrine, as the reason for seekingseparate treatment.

Id., at 189, 527 N. E. 2d, at 775.
By 1989, only one child from Kiryas Joel was attendingMonroe-Woodbury's public schools; the village's other handicapped children received privately funded special services or
went without. It was then that the New York Legislaturepassed the statute at issue in this litigation, which provided

that the village of Kiryas Joel "is constituted a separateschool district, . . . and shall have and enjoy all the powers
and duties of a union free school district . . . ." 1989 N. Y.Laws, ch. 748.

1 The statute thus empowered a locally

elected board of education to take such action as openingschools and closing them, hiring teachers, prescribing textbooks, establishing disciplinary rules, and raising propertytaxes to fund operations. N. Y. Educ. Law $ 1709 (McKinney 1988). In signing the bill into law, Governor Cuomo rec-ognized that the residents of the new school district were
"all members of the same religious sect," but said that the
bill was "a good faith effort to solve th[e] unique problem"
associated with providing special education services to handicapped children in the village. Memorandum filed with Assembly Bill Number 8747 (July 24, 1989), App. 40-41.

Although it enjoys plenary legal authority over the elementary and secondary education of all school-aged children

1 The statute provides in full:
"Section 1. The territory of the village of Kiryas Joel in the town of
Monroe, Orange county, on the date when this act shall take effect, shall
be and hereby is constituted a separate school district, and shall be known
as the Kiryas Joel village school district and shall have and enjoy all the
powers and duties of a union free school district under the provisions of
the education law.

"$ 2. Such district shall be under the control of a board of education,
which shall be composed of from five to nine members elected by the
qualified voters of the village of Kiryas Joel, said members to serve for
terms not exceeding five years.

the date on which it shall have become a law."

SCHOOL DIST. v. GRUMET

Opinion of the Court

in the village, N. Y. Educ. Law $ 3202 (McKinney 1981 andSupp. 1994), the Kiryas Joel Village School District currently

runs only a special education program for handicapped chil-dren. The other village children have stayed in their parochial schools, relying on the new school district only for
transportation, remedial education, and health and welfareservices. If any child without a handicap in Kiryas Joel

were to seek a public-school education, the district would paytuition to send the child into Monroe-Woodbury or another
school district nearby. Under like arrangements, several ofthe neighboring districts send their handicapped Hasidic
children into Kiryas Joel, so that two thirds of the full-timestudents in the village's public school come from outside. In
all, the new district serves just over 40 full-time students,
and two or three times that many parochial school studentson a part-time basis.

Several months before the new district began operations,
the New York State School Boards Association and respondents Grumet and Hawk brought this action against the State
Education Department and various state officials, challenging Chapter 748 under the National and State Constitutions
as an unconstitutional establishment of religion.2 The State
Supreme Court for Albany County allowed the Kiryas Joel
Village School District and the Monroe-Woodbury Central
School District to intervene as parties defendant and accepted the parties' stipulation discontinuing the action
against the original state defendants, although the attorney
general of New York continued to appear to defend the constitutionality of the statute. See N. Y. Exec. Law $ 71 (Mc2 Messrs. Grumet and Hawk sued in both their individual capacities and
as officers of the State School Boards Association, but New York's Appellate Division ruled that the Association and its officers lacked standing to
challenge the constitutionality of Chapter 748. 187 App. Div. 2d 16, 19,

that the statute failed all three prongs of the test in Lemonv.

Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971), and was thus unconstitutional under both the National and State Constitutions.
Grumet v. New York State Ed. Dept., 151 Misc. 2d 60, 579N. Y. S. 2d 1004 (1992).

A divided Appellate Division affirmed on the ground thatChapter 748 had the primary effect of advancing religion, in
violation of both constitutions, 187 App. Div. 2d 16, 592N. Y. S. 2d 123 (1992), and the State Court of Appeals affirmed on the federal question, while expressly reserving the
state constitutional issue, 81 N. Y. 2d 518, 618 N. E. 2d 94
(1993). Judge Smith wrote for the court in concluding that
because both the district's public-school population and its
school board would be exclusively Hasidic, the statute created a "symbolic union of church and State" that was "likely
to be perceived by the Satmarer Hasidim as an endorsement
of their religious choices, or by nonadherents as a disapproval" of their own. Id., at 529, 618 N. E. 2d, at 100. As
a result, said the majority, the statute's primary effect was
an impermissible advancement of religious belief. In a concurring opinion, Judge Hancock found the effect purposeful,
so that the statute violated the first as well as the second
prong of Lemon. 81 N. Y. 2d, at 540, 618 N. E. 2d, at 107.
Chief Judge Kaye took a different tack, applying the strict
scrutiny we have prescribed for statutes singling out a particular religion for special privileges or burdens; she found
Chapter 748 invalid as an unnecessarily broad response to a
narrow problem, since it creates a full school district instead
of simply prescribing a local school for the village's handicapped children. Id., at 532, 618 N. E. 2d, at 102 (concurring
opinion). In dissent, Judge Bellacosa objected that the new
district was created to enable the village's handicapped children to receive a secular, public-school education; that this
was, indeed, its primary effect; and that any attenuated ben512us3$90M 01-08-98 12:44:38 PAGES OPINPGT

"A proper respect for both the Free Exercise and the Es-tablishment Clauses compels the State to pursue a course of

`neutrality' toward religion," Committee for Public Ed. &Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 792-793 (1973),
favoring neither one religion over others nor religious ad-herents collectively over nonadherents. See Epperson v.
Arkansas, 393 U. S. 97, 104 (1968). Chapter 748, the statutecreating the Kiryas Joel Village School District, departs from
this constitutional command by delegating the State's discre-tionary authority over public schools to a group defined by
its character as a religious community, in a legal and histori-cal context that gives no assurance that governmental power
has been or will be exercised neutrally.

Larkin v. Grendel's Den, Inc., 459 U. S. 116 (1982), pro-vides an instructive comparison with the litigation before us.

There, the Court was requested to strike down a Massachu-setts statute granting religious bodies veto power over applications for liquor licenses. Under the statute, the governingbody of any church, synagogue, or school located within 500
feet of an applicant's premises could, simply by submittingwritten objection, prevent the Alcohol Beverage Control
Commission from issuing a license. Id., at 117. In spite ofthe State's valid interest in protecting churches, schools, and
like institutions from " `the hurly-burly' associated with liq-uor outlets," id., at 123 (internal quotation marks omitted),
the Court found that in two respects the statute violated"[t]he wholesome `neutrality' of which this Court's cases
speak," School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374U. S. 203, 222 (1963). The Act brought about a " `fusion of

governmental and religious functions' " by delegating "important, discretionary governmental powers" to religious
bodies, thus impermissibly entangling government and religion. 459 U. S., at 126, 127 (quoting School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, supra, at 222); see also Lemon v.

be used exclusively for secular, neutral, and nonideological
purposes,' " 459 U. S., at 125 (quoting Committee for Public
Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, supra, at 780); this,
along with the "significant symbolic benefit to religion" associated with "the mere appearance of a joint exercise of legislative authority by Church and State," led the Court to conclude that the statute had a " `primary' and `principal' effect
of advancing religion," 459 U. S., at 125-126; see also Lemon
v. Kurtzman, supra, at 612. Comparable constitutional
problems inhere in the statute before us.

Opinion of Souter, J.

The Establishment Clause problem presented by Chapter748 is more subtle, but it resembles the issue raised in

Larkin to the extent that the earlier case teaches that a Statemay not delegate its civic authority to a group chosen according to a religious criterion. Authority over public schools
belongs to the State, N. Y. Const., Art. XI, $ 1, and cannotbe delegated to a local school district defined by the State in

order to grant political control to a religious group. Whatmakes this litigation different from

Larkin is the delegation
here of civic power to the "qualified voters of the village ofKiryas Joel," 1989 N. Y. Laws, ch. 748, as distinct from a

religious leader such as the village rov, or an institution of
religious government like the formally constituted parish
council in Larkin. In light of the circumstances of these
cases, however, this distinction turns out to lack constitutional significance.

It is, first, not dispositive that the recipients of state power
in these cases are a group of religious individuals united by
common doctrine, not the group's leaders or officers. Although some school district franchise is common to all voters,
the State's manipulation of the franchise for this district limited it to Satmars, giving the sect exclusive control of the
political subdivision. In the circumstances of these cases,
the difference between thus vesting state power in the members of a religious group as such instead of the officers of its
sectarian organization is one of form, not substance. It is
true that religious people (or groups of religious people)
cannot be denied the opportunity to exercise the rights of
citizens simply because of their religious affiliations or commitments, for such a disability would violate the right to
religious free exercise, see McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U. S. 618
(1978), which the First Amendment guarantees as certainly
as it bars any establishment. But McDaniel, which held
that a religious individual could not, because of his religious
activities, be denied the right to hold political office, is not in
point here. That individuals who happen to be religious

Opinion of Souter, J.
may hold public office does not mean that a State may delib-erately delegate discretionary power to an individual, institution, or community on the ground of religious identity. IfNew York were to delegate civic authority to "the Grand
Rebbe," Larkin would obviously require invalidation (even
though under McDaniel the Grand Rebbe may run for, andserve on, his local school board), and the same is true if New

York delegates political authority by reference to religiousbelief. Where "fusion" is an issue, the difference lies in the
distinction between a government's purposeful delegation onthe basis of religion and a delegation on principles neutral to
religion, to individuals whose religious identities are incidental to their receipt of civic authority.

Of course, Chapter 748 delegates power not by express
reference to the religious belief of the Satmar community,
but to residents of the "territory of the village of Kiryas
Joel." 1989 N. Y. Laws, ch. 748. Thus the second (and arguably more important) distinction between these cases and
Larkin is the identification here of the group to exercise civil
authority in terms not expressly religious. But our analysis
does not end with the text of the statute at issue, see Church
of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 534
(1993); Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 56-61 (1985); Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, 341-342 (1960), and the context here persuades us that Chapter 748 effectively identifies
these recipients of governmental authority by reference to
doctrinal adherence, even though it does not do so expressly.
We find this to be the better view of the facts because of the
way the boundary lines of the school district divide residents
according to religious affiliation, under the terms of an unusual and special legislative Act.

It is undisputed that those who negotiated the village
boundaries when applying the general village incorporation
statute drew them so as to exclude all but Satmars, and that
the New York Legislature was well aware that the village
remained exclusively Satmar in 1989 when it adopted Chap512us3$90M 01-08-98 12:44:38 PAGES OPINPGT

ter 748. See Brief for Petitioner in No. 93-517, p. 20; Brieffor Respondents 11. The significance of this fact to the state

legislature is indicated by the further fact that carving outthe village school district ran counter to customary districting practices in the State. Indeed, the trend in New York isnot toward dividing school districts but toward consolidating
them. The thousands of small common school districts laidout in the early 19th century have been combined and recombined, first into union free school districts and then intolarger central school districts, until only a tenth as many
remain today. Univ. of State of N. Y. and State EducationDept., School District Reorganization, Law Pamphlet 14,
pp. 8-12 (1962) (hereinafter Law Pamphlet); Woodward,N. Y. State Education Dept., Legal and Organizational History of School District Reorganization in New York State10-11 (Aug. 1986). Most of these cover several towns, many
of them cross county boundaries, and only one remains pre-cisely coterminous with an incorporated village. Law Pamphlet, at 24. The object of the State's practice of consolida-tion is the creation of districts large enough to provide a
comprehensive education at affordable cost, which is thoughtto require at least 500 pupils for a combined junior-senior
high school. Univ. of State of N. Y. and State EducationDept., Master Plan for School District Reorganization in
New York State 10-11 (rev. ed. 1958).3 The Kiryas Joel Vil-lage School District, in contrast, has only 13 local, full-time
students in all (even including out-of-area and part-time stu-dents leaves the number under 200), and in offering only special education and remedial programs it makes no pretenseto be a full-service district.

reorganization,4 is likewise anomalous. Although the legis-lature has established some 20 existing school districts by

special Act, all but one of these are districts in name only,having been designed to be run by private organizations
serving institutionalized children. They have neither tax
bases nor student populations of their own but serve childrenplaced by other school districts or public agencies. See N. Y.

Educ. Law $ 3601-a (Statutory Notes), $$ 4001 and 4005 (Mc-Kinney Supp. 1994); Law Pamphlet, at 18 ("These districts

Act of the legislature to serve a whole community, as thisone was, is a district formed for a new town, much larger
and more heterogeneous than this village, being built on land
that straddled two existing districts. See 1972 N. Y. Laws,ch. 928 (authorizing Gananda School District). Thus the

Kiryas Joel Village School District is exceptional to the pointof singularity, as the only district coming to our notice that
the legislature carved from a single existing district to servelocal residents. Clearly this district "cannot be seen as the
fulfillment of [a village's] destiny as an independent govern-mental entity,"

superintendent to "organize a new school district," $ 1504, which may
allow secession from an existing district, but this general law played no
part in the creation of the Kiryas Joel Village School District.

religion rather than geography is the organizing principle for this district.

SCHOOL DIST. v. GRUMET

Opinion of the Court

Because the district's creation ran uniquely counter tostate practice, following the lines of a religious community

where the customary and neutral principles would not havedictated the same result, we have good reasons to treat this
district as the reflection of a religious criterion for identify-ing the recipients of civil authority. Not even the special
needs of the children in this community can explain the legis-lature's unusual Act, for the State could have responded to
the concerns of the Satmar parents without implicating theEstablishment Clause, as we explain in some detail further
on. We therefore find the legislature's Act to be substan-tially equivalent to defining a political subdivision and hence
the qualification for its franchise by a religious test, resultingin a purposeful and forbidden "fusion of governmental and
religious functions." Larkin v. Grendel's Den, 459 U. S., at126 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

B
The fact that this school district was created by a specialand unusual Act of the legislature also gives reason for concern whether the benefit received by the Satmar communityis one that the legislature will provide equally to other religious (and nonreligious) groups. This is the second malady
understanding was that if a non-Hasidic child were to move into the village, the district would pay tuition to send the child to one of the neighboring school districts, since Kiryas Joel would have no regular education
program. Although the need for such a transfer has not yet arisen, there
are 20 Hasidic children with handicapping conditions who transfer into
Kiryas Joel's school district from the nearby East Ramapo and MonroeWoodbury school districts.

6 Because it is the unusual circumstances of this district's creation that

persuade us the State has employed a religious criterion for delegating
political power, this conclusion does not imply that any political subdivision that is coterminous with the boundaries of a religiously homogeneous
community suffers the same constitutional infirmity. The district in these
cases is distinguishable from one whose boundaries are derived according
to neutral historical and geographic criteria, but whose population happens to comprise coreligionists.

Opinion of the Court
the Larkin Court identified in the law before it, the absenceof an "effective means of guaranteeing" that governmental

power will be and has been neutrally employed. Id., at 125(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). But
whereas in Larkin it was religious groups the Court thoughtmight exercise civic power to advance the interests of religion (or religious adherents), here the threat to neutralityoccurs at an antecedent stage.

The fundamental source of constitutional concern here isthat the legislature itself may fail to exercise governmental
authority in a religiously neutral way. The anomalouslycase-specific nature of the legislature's exercise of state authority in creating this district for a religious communityleaves the Court without any direct way to review such state
action for the purpose of safeguarding a principle at theheart of the Establishment Clause, that government should
not prefer one religion to another, or religion to irreligion.See Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S., at 52-54; Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U. S., at 104; School Dist. of Abington Townshipv.

Schempp, 374 U. S., at 216-217. Because the religiouscommunity of Kiryas Joel did not receive its new governmental authority simply as one of many communities eligible forequal treatment under a general law,

7 we have no assurance

that the next similarly situated group seeking a school dis-trict of its own will receive one; unlike an administrative

agency's denial of an exemption from a generally applicablelaw, which "would be entitled to a judicial audience,"

Olsenv.
Drug Enforcement Admin., 878 F. 2d 1458, 1461 (CADC1989) (R. B. Ginsburg, J.), a legislature's failure to enact a

special law is itself unreviewable. Nor can the historicalcontext in these cases furnish us with any reason to suppose
that the Satmars are merely one in a series of communities

7 This contrasts with the process by which the village of Kiryas Joel
itself was created, involving, as it did, the application of a neutral state
law designed to give almost any group of residents the right to incorporate. See supra, at 691.

receiving the benefit of special school district laws. Earlyon in the development of public education in New York, the

State rejected highly localized school districts for New YorkCity when they were promoted as a way to allow separate
schooling for Roman Catholic children. R. Church & M.Sedlak, Education in the United States 162, 167-169 (1976).
And in more recent history, the special Act in these casesstands alone. See

supra, at 701.The general principle that civil power must be exercised

in a manner neutral to religion is one the Larkin Court rec-ognized, although it did not discuss the specific possibility of
legislative favoritism along religious lines because the stat-ute before it delegated state authority to any religious group
assembled near the premises of an applicant for a liquor li-cense, see 459 U. S., at 120-121, n. 3, as well as to a further
category of institutions not identified by religion. But theprinciple is well grounded in our case law, as we have frequently relied explicitly on the general availability of anybenefit provided religious groups or individuals in turning
aside Establishment Clause challenges. In Walz v. TaxComm'n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664, 673 (1970), for
example, the Court sustained a property tax exemption forreligious properties in part because the State had "not singled out one particular church or religious group or evenchurches as such," but had exempted "a broad class of property owned by nonprofit, quasi-public corporations." Ac-cord,

id., at 696-697 (opinion of Harlan, J.). And Bowen v.Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 608 (1988), upheld a statute enlisting

a "wide spectrum of organizations" in addressing adolescentsexuality because the law was "neutral with respect to the
grantee's status as a sectarian or purely secular institu-tion."

8 See also Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U. S.

affiliation; it recognized that government aid may not flow to an institution

see Larson v. Valente, 456 U. S. 228, 244-246 (1982), and weare forced to conclude that the State of New York has violated the Establishment Clause.

C
In finding that Chapter 748 violates the requirement ofgovernmental neutrality by extending the benefit of a special

franchise, we do not deny that the Constitution allows theState to accommodate religious needs by alleviating special
burdens. Our cases leave no doubt that in commanding neu-trality the Religion Clauses do not require the government
to be oblivious to impositions that legitimate exercises ofstate power may place on religious belief and practice.
Rather, there is "ample room under the EstablishmentClause for `benevolent neutrality which will permit religious
exercise to exist without sponsorship and without interfer-ence,' " Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327, 334 (1987)(quoting Walz v. Tax Comm'n, supra, at 673); "government

Clause." Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm'n of
Fla., 480 U. S. 136, 144-145 (1987). The fact that Chapter
748 facilitates the practice of religion is not what renders itan unconstitutional establishment. Cf.

Lee v. Weisman, 505
U. S. 577, 627 (1992) (Souter, J., concurring) ("That government must remain neutral in matters of religion does notforeclose it from ever taking religion into account");

characterize the refusal to provide chaplains and places ofworship for prisoners and soldiers cut off by the State from
all civilian opportunities for public communion").But accommodation is not a principle without limits, and
what petitioners seek is an adjustment to the Satmars' religiously grounded preferences 9 that our cases do not counte-nance. Prior decisions have allowed religious communities

and institutions to pursue their own interests free from
governmental interference, see Corporation of Presiding
Bishop v. Amos, supra, at 336-337 (government may allow
religious organizations to favor their own adherents in hiring, even for secular employment); Zorach v. Clauson, 343
U. S. 306 (1952) (government may allow public schools to release students during the schoolday to receive off-site religious education), but we have never hinted that an otherwise
unconstitutional delegation of political power to a religious
group could be saved as a religious accommodation. Petitioners' proposed accommodation singles out a particular religious sect for special treatment,10 and whatever the limits
of permissible legislative accommodations may be, compare

explains that the Satmars prefer to live together "to facilitate individual
religious observance and maintain social, cultural and religious values,"
but that it is not " `against their religion' to interact with others." Brief

10 In this respect, it goes beyond even Larkin, transferring political

authority to a single religious group rather than to any church or school.

Opinion of the Court
Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, supra (striking down lawexempting only religious publications from taxation), with

Corporation of Presiding Bishop v. Amos, supra (upholdinglaw exempting religious employers from Title VII), it is clear
that neutrality as among religions must be honored. See
Larson v. Valente, supra, at 244-246.This conclusion does not, however, bring the Satmar parents, the Monroe-Woodbury school district, or the State ofNew York to the end of the road in seeking ways to respond
to the parents' concerns. Just as the Court in Larkin ob-served that the State's interest in protecting religious meeting places could be "readily accomplished by other means,"
459 U. S., at 124, there are several alternatives here for providing bilingual and bicultural special education to Satmar
children. Such services can perfectly well be offered to village children through the Monroe-Woodbury Central School
District. Since the Satmars do not claim that separatism is
religiously mandated, their children may receive bilingual
and bicultural instruction at a public school already run by
the Monroe-Woodbury district. Or if the educationally appropriate offering by Monroe-Woodbury should turn out to
be a separate program of bilingual and bicultural education
at a neutral site near one of the village's parochial schools,
this Court has already made it clear that no Establishment
Clause difficulty would inhere in such a scheme, administered in accordance with neutral principles that would not
necessarily confine special treatment to Satmars. See Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S., at 247-248.

To be sure, the parties disagree on whether the services
Monroe-Woodbury actually provided in the late 1980's were
appropriately tailored to the needs of Satmar children, but
this dispute is of only limited relevance to the question
whether such services could have been provided, had adjustments been made. As we understand New York law,
parents who are dissatisfied with their handicapped child's
program have recourse through administrative review pro512us3$90M 01-08-98 12:44:38 PAGES OPINPGT

Justice Cardozo once cast the dissenter as "the gladiatormaking a last stand against the lions." B. Cardozo, Law and

Literature 34 (1931). Justice Scalia's dissent is certainlythe work of a gladiator, but he thrusts at lions of his own
imagining. We do not disable a religiously homogeneousgroup from exercising political power conferred on it without
regard to religion. Cf. post, at 735-736. Unlike the Statesof Utah and New Mexico (which were laid out according to
traditional political methodologies taking account of lines oflatitude and longitude and topographical features, see U. S.
Dept. of Interior, F. Van Zandt, Boundaries of the UnitedStates and the Several States 250-257 (Geological Survey
Bulletin 1212, 1966)), the reference line chosen for the KiryasJoel Village School District was one purposely drawn to separate Satmars from non-Satmars. Nor do we impugn themotives of the New York Legislature, cf.

post, at 737-740,which no doubt intended to accommodate the Satmar community without violating the Establishment Clause; we sim-ply refuse to ignore that the method it chose is one that aids
a particular religious community, as such, see App. 19-20(Assembly sponsor thrice describes the Act's beneficiaries as
the "Hasidic" children or community), rather than all groupssimilarly interested in separate schooling. The dissent protests it is novel to insist " `up front' " that a statute not tailorits benefits to apply only to one religious group,

turned out differently, see 489 U. S., at 14-15 (opinion ofBrennan, J.);

id., at 28 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment), and language in Walz v. Tax Comm'n of New York
City, 397 U. S., at 673, and Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S., at
608, purporting to rely on the breadth of the statutory
schemes would have been mere surplusage. Indeed, underthe dissent's theory, if New York were to pass a law providing school buses only for children attending Christian dayschools, we would be constrained to uphold the statute
against Establishment Clause attack until faced by a requestfrom a non-Christian family for equal treatment under the
patently unequal law. Cf. Everson v. Board of Ed. of
Ewing, 330 U. S., at 17 (upholding school bus service provided all pupils). And to end on the point with which Justice Scalia begins, the license he takes in suggesting that
the Court holds the Satmar sect to be New York's established church, see post, at 732, is only one symptom of his
inability to accept the fact that this Court has long held that
the First Amendment reaches more than classic, 18thcentury establishments. See Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U. S.,
at 492-495.

Our job, of course, would be easier if the dissent's position
had prevailed with the Framers and with this Court over the
years. An Establishment Clause diminished to the dimensions acceptable to Justice Scalia could be enforced by a
few simple rules, and our docket would never see cases requiring the application of a principle like neutrality toward
religion as well as among religious sects. But that would
be as blind to history as to precedent, and the difference
between Justice Scalia and the Court accordingly turns on
the Court's recognition that the Establishment Clause does
comprehend such a principle and obligates courts to exercise
the judgment necessary to apply it.

In these cases we are clearly constrained to conclude that
the statute before us fails the test of neutrality. It delegates a power this Court has said "ranks at the very apex of

Affirmed.

Justice Blackmun, concurring.
For the reasons stated by Justice Souter and Justice
Stevens, whose opinions I join, I agree that the New York
statute under review violates the Establishment Clause of
the First Amendment. I write separately only to note my
disagreement with any suggestion that today's decision signals a departure from the principles described in Lemon v.
Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971). The opinion of the Court
(and of the plurality with respect to Part II-A) relies upon
several decisions, including Larkin v. Grendel's Den, Inc.,
459 U. S. 116 (1982), that explicitly rested on the criteria set
forth in Lemon. Indeed, the two principles on which the
opinion bases its conclusion that the legislative Act is constitutionally invalid essentially are the second and third Lemon
criteria. See ante, at 697; Larkin, 459 U. S., at 126-127
(finding " `a fusion of governmental and religious functions' "
under Lemon's "entanglement" prong); 459 U. S., at 125-126
(finding a lack of any " `effective means of guaranteeing' "
that governmental power will be neutrally employed under
Lemon's " `principal' or `primary effect' " prong).

I have no quarrel with the observation of Justice O'Connor, post, at 718-719, that the application of constitutional
principles, including those articulated in Lemon, must be
sensitive to particular contexts. But I remain convinced of
the general validity of the basic principles stated in Lemon,
which have guided this Court's Establishment Clause deci512us3$90F 01-08-98 12:44:38 PAGES OPINPGT

sions in over 30 cases. See Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577,603, n. 4 (1992) (

Blackmun, J., concurring).

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Blackmun and
Justice Ginsburg join, concurring.

New York created a special school district for the members
of the Satmar religious sect in response to parental concern
that children suffered " `panic, fear and trauma' " when" `leaving their own community and being with people whose

ways were so different.' " Ante, at 692. To meet those con-cerns, the State could have taken steps to alleviate the children's fear by teaching their schoolmates to be tolerant andrespectful of Satmar customs. Action of that kind would
raise no constitutional concerns and would further the strongpublic interest in promoting diversity and understanding in
the public schools.

Instead, the State responded with a solution that affirmatively supports a religious sect's interest in segregating itself
and preventing its children from associating with their
neighbors. The isolation of these children, while it may protect them from "panic, fear and trauma," also unquestionably
increased the likelihood that they would remain within the
fold, faithful adherents of their parents' religious faith. By
creating a school district that is specifically intended to
shield children from contact with others who have "different
ways," the State provided official support to cement the attachment of young adherents to a particular faith. It is telling, in this regard, that two-thirds of the school's full-time
students are Hasidic handicapped children from outside the
village; the Kiryas Joel school thus serves a population far
wider than the village--one defined less by geography than

grant an exemption from a burdensome general rule. It is,I believe, fairly characterized as establishing, rather than

merely accommodating, religion. For this reason, as well asthe reasons set out in

Justice Souter's opinion, I am persuaded that the New York law at issue in these cases violates
the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

Justice O'Connor, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.

I
The question at the heart of these cases is: What may the
government do, consistently with the Establishment Clause,to accommodate people's religious beliefs? The history of

the Satmars in Orange County is especially instructive onthis, because they have been involved in at least three accommodation problems, of which these cases are only the
most recent.The first problem related to zoning law, and arose shortly

after the Satmars moved to the town of Monroe in the early1970's. Though the area in which they lived was zoned for
single-family homes, the Satmars subdivided their housesinto several apartments, apparently in part because of their
traditionally close-knit extended family groups. The Sat-mars also used basements of some of their buildings as
schools and synagogues, which according to the town was
also a zoning violation. See N. Y. Times, Oct. 17, 1976, sec-tion 1, p. 53, col. 1; App. 10-14.

Fortunately for the Satmars, New York state law had away of accommodating their concerns. New York allows
virtually any group of residents to incorporate their own village, with broad powers of self-government. The Satmars
followed this course, incorporating their community as the
village of Kiryas Joel, and their zoning problems, at least,
were solved. Ante, at 691.

The Satmars' next need for accommodation arose in the
mid-1980's. Satmar education is pervasively religious, and

is provided through entirely private schooling. But thoughthe Satmars could afford to educate most of their children,

educating the handicapped is a difficult and expensive busi-ness. Moreover, it is a business that the government generally funds, with tax moneys that come from the Satmars as
well as from everyone else. In 1984, therefore, the Monroe-Woodbury Central School District began providing handicapped education services to the Satmar children at an annexto the Satmar religious school. The curriculum and the environment of the services were entirely secular. They werethe same sort of services available to handicapped students
at secular public and private schools throughout the country.

In 1985, however, we held that publicly funded classes on
religious school premises violate the Establishment Clause.
School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373; Aguilar
v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402. Based on these decisions, the
Monroe-Woodbury Central School District stopped providing
services at the Kiryas Joel site, and required the Satmar children to attend public schools outside the village. This, however, was not a satisfactory arrangement for the Satmars, in
part because the Satmar children had a hard time dealing
with immersion in the non-Satmar world. By 1989, only one
handicapped Kiryas Joel child was going to the public
school--the others were getting either privately funded
services or no special education at all. Though the Satmars
tried to reach some other arrangement with the MonroeWoodbury Central School District, the problem was not
resolved.

In response to these difficulties came the third accommodation. In 1989, the New York Legislature passed a statute
to create a special school district covering only the village of
Kiryas Joel. This school district could, of course, only operate secular schools, and the Satmars therefore wanted to use
it only to provide education for the handicapped. But because the district provides this education in the village,
Satmar children could take advantage of the district's serv512us3$90J 01-08-98 12:44:39 PAGES OPINPGT

ices without encountering the problems they faced whenthey were sent out to Monroe-Woodbury schools. It is the

constitutionality of the law creating this district that we arenow called on to decide.

II
The three situations outlined above shed light on an impor-tant aspect of accommodation under the First Amendment:

Religious needs can be accommodated through laws that areneutral with regard to religion. The Satmars' living arrangements were accommodated by their right--a rightshared with all other communities, religious or not, throughout New York--to incorporate themselves as a village.From 1984 to 1985, the Satmar handicapped children's educational needs were accommodated by special educationprograms like those available to all handicapped children,
religious or not. Other examples of such accommodationsabound: The Constitution itself, for instance, accommodates
the religious desires of those who were opposed to oaths byallowing any officeholder--of any religion, or none--to take
either an oath of office or an affirmation. Art. II, $ 1, cl. 8;Art. VI, cl. 3; see also Amdt. 4. Likewise, the selective
service laws provide exemptions for conscientious objectorswhether or not the objection is based on religious beliefs.
Welsh v. United States, 398 U. S. 333, 356 (1970) (Harlan, J.,concurring in result).

We have time and again held that the government gen-erally may not treat people differently based on the God
or gods they worship, or do not worship. "The clearestcommand of the Establishment Clause is that one religious
denomination cannot be officially preferred over another."
Larson v. Valente, 456 U. S. 228, 244 (1982). "Just as wesubject to the most exacting scrutiny laws that make classifications based on race . . . so too we strictly scrutinize gov-ernmental classifications based on religion." Employment

Gillette v. United States, 401 U. S. 437, 450 (1971). "Neither[the State nor the Federal Governments] can constitutionally

pass laws or impose requirements which aid all religions as
against non-believers, and neither can aid those religionsbased on a belief in the existence of God as against those

religions founded on different beliefs." Torcaso v. Watkins,367 U. S. 488, 495 (1961) (footnote omitted). See also

Texas
Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U. S. 1, 8-9 (1989) (pluralityopinion);

Tax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664, 696-697
(1970) (opinion of Harlan, J.).

This emphasis on equal treatment is, I think, an eminently
sound approach. In my view, the Religion Clauses--the
Free Exercise Clause, the Establishment Clause, the Religious Test Clause, Art. VI, cl. 3, and the Equal Protection
Clause as applied to religion--all speak with one voice on
this point: Absent the most unusual circumstances, one's religion ought not affect one's legal rights or duties or benefits.
As I have previously noted, "the Establishment Clause is
infringed when the government makes adherence to religion
relevant to a person's standing in the political community."
Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 69 (1985) (opinion concurring
in judgment).

That the government is acting to accommodate religion
should generally not change this analysis. What makes accommodation permissible, even praiseworthy, is not that the
government is making life easier for some particular religious group as such. Rather, it is that the government is
accommodating a deeply held belief. Accommodations may
thus justify treating those who share this belief differently
from those who do not; but they do not justify discriminations based on sect. A state law prohibiting the consumption of alcohol may exempt sacramental wines, but it may

not exempt sacramental wine use by Catholics but not byJews. A draft law may exempt conscientious objectors, but

it may not exempt conscientious objectors whose objectionsare based on theistic belief (such as Quakers) as opposed to
nontheistic belief (such as Buddhists) or atheistic belief. See
Welsh, 398 U. S., at 356 (Harlan, J., concurring in result); seealso id., at 335-344 (reaching this result on statutory interpretation grounds); United States v. Seeger, 380 U. S. 163(1965) (same). The Constitution permits "nondiscriminatory religious-practice exemption[s]," Smith, supra, at 890(emphasis added), not sectarian ones.

III
I join Parts I, II-B, II-C, and III of the Court's opinionbecause I think this law, rather than being a general accommodation, singles out a particular religious group for favor-able treatment. The Court's analysis of the history of this
law and of the surrounding statutory scheme, ante, at 699-701, persuades me of this.

On its face, this statute benefits one group--the residentsof Kiryas Joel. Because this benefit was given to this group
based on its religion, it seems proper to treat it as a legisla-tively drawn religious classification. I realize this is a close
question, because the Satmars may be the only group whocurrently need this particular accommodation. The legislature may well be acting without any favoritism, so that ifanother group came to ask for a similar district, the group
might get it on the same terms as the Satmars. But thenature of the legislative process makes it impossible to be
sure of this. A legislature, unlike the judiciary or many ad-ministrative decisionmakers, has no obligation to respond to
any group's requests. A group petitioning for a law maynever get a definite response, or may get a "no" based not
on the merits but on the press of other business or the lackof an influential sponsor. Such a legislative refusal to act
would not normally be reviewable by a court. Under these

717Cite as: 512 U. S. 687 (1994)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
circumstances, it seems dangerous to validate what appearsto me a clear religious preference.

Our invalidation of this statute in no way means that theSatmars' needs cannot be accommodated. There is nothing
improper about a legislative intention to accommodate a religious group, so long as it is implemented through generallyapplicable legislation. New York may, for instance, allow all

villages to operate their own school districts. If it does notwant to act so broadly, it may set forth neutral criteria that
a village must meet to have a school district of its own; thesecriteria can then be applied by a state agency, and the decision would then be reviewable by the judiciary. A district
created under a generally applicable scheme would be acceptable even though it coincides with a village that was consciously created by its voters as an enclave for their religious
group. I do not think the Court's opinion holds the contrary.

I also think there is one other accommodation that would
be entirely permissible: the 1984 scheme, which was discontinued because of our decision in Aguilar. The Religion
Clauses prohibit the government from favoring religion, but
they provide no warrant for discriminating against religion.
All handicapped children are entitled by law to governmentfunded special education. See, e. g., Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U. S. C. $ 1400 et seq. If the government provides this education on-site at public schools and
at nonsectarian private schools, it is only fair that it provide
it on-site at sectarian schools as well.

I thought this to be true in Aguilar, see 473 U. S., at 421-
431 (dissenting opinion), and I still believe it today. The
Establishment Clause does not demand hostility to religion,
religious ideas, religious people, or religious schools. Cf.
Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist.,
508 U. S. 384 (1993). It is the Court's insistence on disfavoring religion in Aguilar that led New York to favor it here.
The Court should, in a proper case, be prepared to reconsider
Aguilar, in order to bring our Establishment Clause juris512us3$90J 01-08-98 12:44:39 PAGES OPINPGT

prudence back to what I think is the proper track--govern-ment impartiality, not animosity, toward religion.

IV
One aspect of the Court's opinion in these cases is worthnoting: Like the opinions in two recent cases, Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577 (1992); Zobrest v. Catalina FoothillsSchool Dist., 509 U. S. 1 (1993), and the case I think is most
relevant to these, Larson v. Valente, 456 U. S. 228 (1982), theCourt's opinion does not focus on the Establishment Clause
test we set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971).It is always appealing to look for a single test, a Grand
Unified Theory that would resolve all the cases that mayarise under a particular Clause. There is, after all, only one
Establishment Clause, one Free Speech Clause, one FourthAmendment, one Equal Protection Clause. See

Craig v.
Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 211 (1976) (Stevens, J., concurring).But the same constitutional principle may operate very

differently in different contexts. We have, for instance, noone Free Speech Clause test. We have different tests for
content-based speech restrictions, for content-neutral speechrestrictions, for restrictions imposed by the government acting as employer, for restrictions in nonpublic fora, and soon. This simply reflects the necessary recognition that the
interests relevant to the Free Speech Clause inquiry--per-sonal liberty, an informed citizenry, government efficiency,
public order, and so on--are present in different degrees ineach context.

And setting forth a unitary test for a broad set of casesmay sometimes do more harm than good. Any test that
must deal with widely disparate situations risks being sovague as to be useless. I suppose one can say that the general test for all free speech cases is "a regulation is validif the interests asserted by the government are stronger
than the interests of the speaker and the listeners," butthis would hardly be a serviceable formulation. Similarly,

719Cite as: 512 U. S. 687 (1994)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Lemon has, with some justification, been criticized on thisscore.

Moreover, shoehorning new problems into a test that doesnot reflect the special concerns raised by those problems
tends to deform the language of the test. Relatively simple
phrases like "primary effect . . . that neither advances norinhibits religion" and " `entanglement,' "

Lemon, supra, at
612-613, acquire more and more complicated definitionswhich stray ever further from their literal meaning. Distinctions are drawn between statutes whose effect is to ad-vance religion and statutes whose effect is to allow religious
organizations to advance religion. See, e. g., Corporation of
Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327, 336-337 (1987); id., at 347
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (discussing this
point). Assertions are made that authorizing churches to
veto liquor sales in surrounding areas "can be seen as having
a `primary' and `principal' effect of advancing religion."
Larkin v. Grendel's Den, Inc., 459 U. S. 116, 125-126 (1982).
"[E]ntanglement" is discovered in public employers monitoring the performance of public employees--surely a proper
enough function--on parochial school premises, and in the
public employees cooperating with the school on class scheduling and other administrative details. Aguilar v. Felton,
473 U. S., at 413. Alternatives to Lemon suffer from a similar failing when they lead us to find "coercive pressure" to
pray when a school asks listeners--with no threat of legal
sanctions--to stand or remain silent during a graduation
prayer. Lee v. Weisman, supra, at 592. Some of the results and perhaps even some of the reasoning in these cases
may have been right. I joined two of the cases cited above,
Larkin and Lee, and continue to believe they were correctly
decided. But I think it is more useful to recognize the relevant concerns in each case on their own terms, rather than
trying to squeeze them into language that does not really
apply to them.

SCHOOL DIST. v. GRUMET

Opinion of O'Connor, J.

Finally, another danger to keep in mind is that the badtest may drive out the good. Rather than taking the opportunity to derive narrower, more precise tests from the caselaw, courts tend to continually try to patch up the broad test,
making it more and more amorphous and distorted. This, I
am afraid, has happened with Lemon.Experience proves that the Establishment Clause, like the

Free Speech Clause, cannot easily be reduced to a single test.There are different categories of Establishment Clause
cases, which may call for different approaches. Some cases,like these, involve government actions targeted at particular
individuals or groups, imposing special duties or giving special benefits. Cases involving government speech on religious topics, see, e. g., Lee v. Weisman, supra; Allegheny
County v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573 (1989); Lynch v. Donnelly, 465
U. S. 668 (1984); Stone v. Graham, 449 U. S. 39 (1980), seem
to me to fall into a different category and to require an analysis focusing on whether the speech endorses or disapproves
of religion, rather than on whether the government action is
neutral with regard to religion. See Allegheny County,
supra, at 623-637 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

Another category encompasses cases in which the government must make decisions about matters of religious
doctrine and religious law. See Serbian Eastern Orthodox
Diocese for United States and Canada v. Milivojevich, 426
U. S. 696 (1976) (which also did not apply Lemon). These
cases, which often arise in the application of otherwise neutral property or contract principles to religious institutions,
involve complicated questions not present in other situations.
See, e. g., 426 U. S., at 721 (looking at some aspects of religious law to determine the structure of the church, but refusing to look further into religious law to resolve the ultimate
dispute). Government delegations of power to religious
bodies may make up yet another category. As Larkin itself

721Cite as: 512 U. S. 687 (1994)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
suggested, government impartiality towards religion may
not be enough in such situations: A law that bars all alcohol
sales within some distance of a church, school, or hospital
may be valid, but an equally evenhanded law that gives each
institution discretionary power over the sales may not be.
Larkin, supra, at 123-124. Of course, there may well be
additional categories, or more opportune places to draw the
lines between the categories.

As the Court's opinion today shows, the slide away from
Lemon's unitary approach is well under way. A return to
Lemon, even if possible, would likely be futile, regardless of
where one stands on the substantive Establishment Clause
questions. I think a less unitary approach provides a better
structure for analysis. If each test covers a narrower and
more homogeneous area, the tests may be more precise and
therefore easier to apply. There may be more opportunity
to pay attention to the specific nuances of each area. There
might also be, I hope, more consensus on each of the narrow
tests than there has been on a broad test. And abandoning
the Lemon framework need not mean abandoning some of
the insights that the test reflected, nor the insights of the
cases that applied it.

Perhaps eventually under this structure we may indeed
distill a unified, or at least a more unified, Establishment
Clause test from the cases. Cf. Clark v. Community for
Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 298-299 (1984) (uniting
two strands of Free Speech Clause doctrine). But it seems
to me that the case law will better be able to evolve towards
this if it is freed from the Lemon test's rigid influence. The
hard questions would, of course, still have to be asked; but
they will be asked within a more carefully tailored and less
distorted framework.

For the reasons stated, I would affirm the judgment of the
Court of Appeals of the State of New York.

SCHOOL DIST. v. GRUMET

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment

Justice Kennedy, concurring in the judgment.
The Court's ruling that the Kiryas Joel Village School Dis-trict violates the Establishment Clause is in my view correct,

but my reservations about what the Court's reasoning im-plies for religious accommodations in general are sufficient
to require a separate writing. As the Court recognizes, alegislative accommodation that discriminates among religions may become an establishment of religion. But theCourt's opinion can be interpreted to say that an accommodation for a particular religious group is invalid because of therisk that the legislature will not grant the same accommodation to another religious group suffering some similar bur-den. This rationale seems to me without grounding in our
precedents and a needless restriction upon the legislature'sability to respond to the unique problems of a particular religious group. The real vice of the school district, in my esti-mation, is that New York created it by drawing political
boundaries on the basis of religion. I would decide the issuewe confront upon this narrower theory, though in accord
with many of the Court's general observations about theState's actions in this litigation.

I
This is not an action in which the government has granteda benefit to a general class of recipients of which religious

groups are just one part. See Zobrest v. Catalina FoothillsSchool Dist., 509 U. S. 1 (1993); Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S.
589 (1988); Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind,474 U. S. 481 (1986); Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388 (1983).
It is rather an action in which the government seeks to alle-viate a specific burden on the religious practices of a particular religious group. I agree that a religious accommodationdemands careful scrutiny to ensure that it does not so burden
nonadherents or discriminate against other religions as tobecome an establishment. I disagree, however, with the
suggestion that the Kiryas Joel Village School District con-travenes these basic constitutional commands. But for the

forbidden manner in which the New York Legislature sought
to go about it, the State's attempt to accommodate the special needs of the handicapped Satmar children would have
been valid.

and support for religion are an accepted part of our political
and cultural heritage." Allegheny County v. American
Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S.
573, 657 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part
and dissenting in part). Before the Revolution, colonial governments made a frequent practice of exempting religious
objectors from general laws. See McConnell, The Origins
and Historical Understanding of Free Exercise of Religion,
103 Harv. L. Rev. 1409, 1466-1473 (1990) (recounting colonial
exemptions from oath requirements, compulsory military
service, religious assessments, and other general legislation).
As early as 1691, for instance, New York allowed Quakers to
testify by affirmation rather than oath in civil court cases.

Title VII's prohibition of religious discrimination); Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494
U. S. 872, 890 (1990) (exemption from drug laws for sacramental peyote use) (dicta).New York's object in creating the Kiryas Joel Village

School District--to accommodate the religious practices ofthe handicapped Satmar children--is validated by the principles that emerge from these precedents. First, by creatingthe district, New York sought to alleviate a specific and identifiable burden on the Satmars' religious practice. The
Satmars' way of life, which springs out of their strict religious beliefs, conflicts in many respects with mainstream
American culture. They do not watch television or listen to
radio; they speak Yiddish in their homes and do not read
English-language publications; and they have a distinctive
hairstyle and dress. Attending the Monroe-Woodbury public schools, where they were exposed to much different ways
of life, caused the handicapped Satmar children understandable anxiety and distress. New York was entitled to relieve
these significant burdens, even though mainstream public
schooling does not conflict with any specific tenet of the
Satmars' religious faith. The Title VII exemption upheld in
Corporation of Presiding Bishop, supra, for example, covers
religious groups who may not believe themselves obliged to
employ coreligionists in every instance. See also Walz v.
Tax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664, 673 (1970)
("The limits of permissible state accommodation to religion
are by no means co-extensive with the noninterference mandated by the Free Exercise Clause"); accord, Smith, supra,
at 890 (legislatures may grant accommodations even when
courts may not).

Second, by creating the district, New York did not impose
or increase any burden on non-Satmars, compared to the burden it lifted from the Satmars, that might disqualify the dis512us3$90L 01-08-98 12:44:39 PAGES OPINPGT

725Cite as: 512 U. S. 687 (1994)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
trict as a genuine accommodation. In Gillette, supra, theCourt upheld a military draft exemption, even though the

burden on those without religious objection to war (the in-creased chance of being drafted and forced to risk one's life
in battle) was substantial. And in Corporation of Presiding
Bishop, the Court upheld the Title VII exemption eventhough it permitted employment discrimination against nonpractitioners of the religious organization's faith. There isa point, to be sure, at which an accommodation may impose
a burden on nonadherents so great that it becomes an estab-lishment. See,

e. g., Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, Inc., 472
U. S. 703, 709-710 (1985) (invalidating mandatory Sabbath
day off because it provided "no exception when honoring the
dictates of Sabbath observers would cause the employer substantial economic burdens or when the employer's compliance would require the imposition of significant burdens on
other employees required to work in place of the Sabbath
observers"). This action has not been argued, however, on
the theory that non-Satmars suffer any special burdens from
the existence of the Kiryas Joel Village School District.

Third, the creation of the school district to alleviate the
special burdens born by the handicapped Satmar children
cannot be said, for that reason alone, to favor the Satmar
religion to the exclusion of any other. "The clearest command of the Establishment Clause," of course, "is that one
religious denomination cannot be officially preferred over another." Larson v. Valente, 456 U. S. 228, 244 (1982); accord,
Smith, supra, at 886, n. 3. I disagree, however, with the
Court's conclusion that the school district breaches this command. The Court insists that religious favoritism is a danger here, because the "anomalously case-specific nature of
the legislature's exercise of state authority in creating this
district for a religious community leaves the Court without
any direct way to review such state action" to ensure interdenominational neutrality. Ante, at 703. "Because the religious community of Kiryas Joel did not receive its new gov512us3$90L 01-08-98 12:44:39 PAGES OPINPGT

eligible for equal treatment under a general law," the Court
maintains, "we have no assurance that the next similarly situated group seeking a school district of its own will receive
one; . . . a legislature's failure to enact a special law is itself
unreviewable." Ibid. (footnote omitted).

This reasoning reverses the usual presumption that a statute is constitutional and, in essence, adjudges the New York
Legislature guilty until it proves itself innocent. No party
has adduced any evidence that the legislature has denied another religious community like the Satmars its own school
district under analogous circumstances. The legislature,
like the judiciary, is sworn to uphold the Constitution, and
we have no reason to presume that the New York Legislature would not grant the same accommodation in a similar
future case. The fact that New York singled out the Satmars for this special treatment indicates nothing other than
the uniqueness of the handicapped Satmar children's plight.
It is normal for legislatures to respond to problems as they
arise--no less so when the issue is religious accommodation.
Most accommodations cover particular religious practices.
See, e. g., 21 CFR $ 1307.31 (1993) ("The listing of peyote as
a controlled substance . . . does not apply to the nondrug
use of peyote in bona fide religious ceremonies of the Native
American Church"); 25 CFR $ 11.87H (1993) ("[I]t shall not
be unlawful for any member of the Native American Church
to transport into Navajo country, buy, sell, possess, or use
peyote in any form in connection with the religious practices,
sacraments or services of the Native American Church");

headgear if they do not interfere with the proper wearing,
functioning, or appearance of the prescribed headgear. . . .

For example, Jewish yarmulkes meet this requirement if
they do not exceed 6 inches in diameter"); National Prohibition Act, $ 3, 41 Stat. 308 ("Liquor for nonbeverage purposes

purchased, sold, bartered, transported, imported, exported,

Law Repeal and Enforcement Act, $ 1, 49 Stat. 872. They
do not thereby become invalid.

Nor is it true that New York's failure to accommodate another religious community facing similar burdens would be
insulated from challenge in the courts. The burdened community could sue the State of New York, contending that
New York's discriminatory treatment of the two religious
communities violated the Establishment Clause. To resolve
this claim, the court would have only to determine whether
the community does indeed bear the same burden on its religious practice as did the Satmars in Kiryas Joel. See Olsen
v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 878 F. 2d 1458, 1463-1465
(CADC 1989) (R. B. Ginsburg, J.) (rejecting claim that the
members of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church were entitled
to an exemption from the marijuana laws on the same terms
as the peyote exemption for the Native American Church);
Olsen v. Iowa, 808 F. 2d 652 (CA8 1986) (same). While a
finding of discrimination would then raise a difficult question
of relief, compare Olsen, 878 F. 2d, at 1464 ("Faced with the
choice between invalidation and extension of any controlledsubstances religious exemption, which would the political
branches choose? It would take a court bolder than this one
to predict . . . that extension, not invalidation, would be the
probable choice"), with Califano v. Westcott, 443 U. S. 76,
89-93 (1979) (curing gender discrimination in the Aid to
Families with Dependent Children program by extending
benefits to children of unemployed mothers instead of denying benefits to children of unemployed fathers), the discrimination itself would not be beyond judicial remedy.

SCHOOL DIST. v. GRUMET

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment

II
The Kiryas Joel Village School District thus does not
suffer any of the typical infirmities that might invalidate an
attempted legislative accommodation. In the ordinary case,
the fact that New York has chosen to accommodate the burdens unique to one religious group would raise no constitutional problems. Without further evidence that New York
has denied the same accommodation to religious groups bearing similar burdens, we could not presume from the particularity of the accommodation that the New York Legislature
acted with discriminatory intent.

This particularity takes on a different cast, however, when
the accommodation requires the government to draw political or electoral boundaries. "The principle that government
may accommodate the free exercise of religion does not supersede the fundamental limitations imposed by the Establishment Clause," Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 587 (1992),
and in my view one such fundamental limitation is that government may not use religion as a criterion to draw political
or electoral lines. Whether or not the purpose is accommodation and whether or not the government provides similar
gerrymanders to people of all religious faiths, the Establishment Clause forbids the government to use religion as a
line-drawing criterion. In this respect, the Establishment
Clause mirrors the Equal Protection Clause. Just as the
government may not segregate people on account of their
race, so too it may not segregate on the basis of religion.
The danger of stigma and stirred animosities is no less acute
for religious line-drawing than for racial. Justice Douglas
put it well in a statement this Court quoted with approval
just last Term:

"When racial or religious lines are drawn by the State,
the multiracial, multireligious communities that our
Constitution seeks to weld together as one become separatist; antagonisms that relate to race or to religion

rather than to political issues are generated; communi-ties seek not the best representative but the best racial

or religious partisan. Since that system is at war withthe democratic ideal, it should find no footing here."
Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U. S. 52, 67 (1964) (Douglas,J., dissenting) (quoted in

Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630,648-649 (1993)).

I agree with the Court insofar as it invalidates the schooldistrict for being drawn along religious lines. As the plurality observes, ante, at 699-700, the New York Legislatureknew that everyone within the village was Satmar when it
drew the school district along the village lines, and it deter-mined who was to be included in the district by imposing, in
effect, a religious test. There is no serious question thatthe legislature configured the school district, with purpose
and precision, along a religious line. This explicit religiousgerrymandering violates the First Amendment Establishment Clause.It is important to recognize the limits of this principle.
We do not confront the constitutionality of the Kiryas Joelvillage itself, and the formation of the village appears to differ from the formation of the school district in one criticalrespect. As the Court notes,

ante, at 703, n. 7, the villagewas formed pursuant to a religion-neutral self-incorporation

scheme. Under New York law, a territory with at least 500residents and not more than five square miles may be incorporated upon petition by at least 20 percent of the votingresidents of that territory or by the owners of more than 50
percent of the territory's real property. N. Y. Village Law$$ 2-200, 2-202 (McKinney 1973 and Supp. 1994). Aside
from ensuring that the petition complies with certain proce-dural requirements, the supervisor of the town in which the
territory is located has no discretion to reject the petition.$ 2-206; see Decision on Sufficiency of Petition, in App. 8, 14
("[T]he hollow provisions of the Village Law . . . allow meonly to review the procedural niceties of the petition itself ").

The residents of the town then vote upon the incorporationpetition in a special election. N. Y. Village Law $ 2-212 (McKinney 1973). By contrast, the Kiryas Joel Village SchoolDistrict was created by state legislation. The State of New
York had complete discretion not to enact it. The State thushad a direct hand in accomplishing the religious segregation.

As the plurality indicates, the Establishment Clause doesnot invalidate a town or a State "whose boundaries are derived according to neutral historical and geographic criteria,but whose population happens to comprise coreligionists."
Ante, at 702, n. 6. People who share a common religiousbelief or lifestyle may live together without sacrificing the
basic rights of self-governance that all American citizensenjoy, so long as they do not use those rights to establish
their religious faith. Religion flourishes in community, andthe Establishment Clause must not be construed as some
sort of homogenizing solvent that forces unconventional reli-gious groups to choose between assimilating to mainstream
American culture or losing their political rights. There ismore than a fine line, however, between the voluntary association that leads to a political community comprised of peoplewho share a common religious faith, and the forced separation that occurs when the government draws explicit politicalboundaries on the basis of peoples' faith. In creating the
Kiryas Joel Village School District, New York crossed thatline, and so we must hold the district invalid.

III
This is an unusual action, for it is rare to see a State exertsuch documented care to carve out territory for people of a

particular religious faith. It is also unusual in that the prob-lem to which the Kiryas Joel Village School District was addressed is attributable in no small measure to what I believewere unfortunate rulings by this Court.

Before 1985, the handicapped Satmar children of KiryasJoel attended the private religious schools within the village

that the other Satmar children attended. Because theirhandicaps were in some cases acute (ranging from mental

retardation and deafness to spina bifida and cerebral palsy),the State of New York provided public funds for special education of these children at annexes to the religious schools.
Then came the companion cases of School Dist. of Grand
Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373 (1985), and Aguilar v. Felton,
473 U. S. 402 (1985). In Grand Rapids, the Court invali-dated a program in which public school teachers would offer

supplemental classes at private schools, including religiousschools, at the end of the regular schoolday. And in

Aguilar, the Court invalidated New York City's use of Title I
funding to pay the salaries of public school teachers who
taught educationally deprived children of low-income families at parochial schools in the city. After these cases, the
Monroe-Woodbury Central School District suspended its special education program at the Kiryas Joel religious schools,
and the Kiryas Joel parents were forced to enroll their handicapped children at the Monroe-Woodbury public schools in
order for the children to receive special education. The ensuing difficulties, as the Court recounts, ante, at 692-693, led
to the creation of the Kiryas Joel Village School District.

The decisions in Grand Rapids and Aguilar may have
been erroneous. In light of the action before us, and in the
interest of sound elaboration of constitutional doctrine, it
may be necessary for us to reconsider them at a later date.
A neutral aid scheme, available to religious and nonreligious
alike, is the preferable way to address problems such as the
Satmar handicapped children have suffered. See Witters,
474 U. S., at 490-492 (Powell, J., concurring). But for Grand
Rapids and Aguilar, the Satmars would have had no need
to seek special accommodations or their own school district.
Our decisions led them to choose that unfortunate course,
with the deficiencies I have described.

One misjudgment is no excuse, however, for compounding it
with another. We must confront this litigation as it comes be512us3$90L 01-08-98 12:44:39 PAGES OPINPGT

fore us, without bending rules to free the Satmars from apredicament into which we put them. The Establishment

Clause forbids the government to draw political boundarieson the basis of religious faith. For this reason, I concur in
the judgment of the Court.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The Court today finds that the Powers That Be, up in Al-bany, have conspired to effect an establishment of the Satmar

Hasidim. I do not know who would be more surprised atthis discovery: the Founders of our Nation or Grand Rebbe
Joel Teitelbaum, founder of the Satmar. The Grand Rebbewould be astounded to learn that after escaping brutal persecution and coming to America with the modest hope of reli-gious toleration for their ascetic form of Judaism, the Satmar
had become so powerful, so closely allied with Mammon, asto have become an "establishment" of the Empire State.
And the Founding Fathers would be astonished to find thatthe Establishment Clause--which they designed "to insure
that no one powerful sect or combination of sects could usepolitical or governmental power to punish dissenters,"

Zor-ach v. Clauson, 343 U. S. 306, 319 (1952) (Black, J., dissenting)--has been employed to prohibit characteristically andadmirably American accommodation of the religious practices (or more precisely, cultural peculiarities) of a tiny mi-nority sect.

I, however, am not surprised. Once this Courthas abandoned text and history as guides, nothing prevents

it from calling religious toleration the establishment ofreligion.

Unlike most of our Establishment Clause cases involvingeducation, these cases involve no public funding, however

slight or indirect, to private religious schools. They do notinvolve private schools at all. The school under scrutiny is a
public school specifically designed to provide a public secular

education to handicapped students. The superintendent ofthe school, who is not Hasidic, is a 20-year veteran of the

New York City public school system, with expertise in thearea of bilingual, bicultural, special education. The teachers
and therapists at the school all live outside the village of
Kiryas Joel. While the village's private schools are pro-foundly religious and strictly segregated by sex, classes at

the public school are co-ed and the curriculum secular. Theschool building has the bland appearance of a public school,
unadorned by religious symbols or markings; and the schoolcomplies with the laws and regulations governing all other
New York State public schools. There is no suggestion,
moreover, that this public school has gone too far in making
special adjustments to the religious needs of its students.
Cf. id., at 312-315 (approving a program permitting early
release of public school students to attend religious instruction). In sum, these cases involve only public aid to a school
that is public as can be. The only thing distinctive about
the school is that all the students share the same religion.

None of our cases has ever suggested that there is anything wrong with that. In fact, the Court has specifically
approved the education of students of a single religion on a
neutral site adjacent to a private religious school. See Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229, 247-248 (1977). In that case,
the Court rejected the argument that "any program that isolates the sectarian pupils is impermissible," id., at 246, and
held that, "[t]he fact that a unit on a neutral site on occasion
may serve only sectarian pupils does not provoke [constitutional] concerns," id., at 247. And just last Term, the Court
held that the State could permit public employees to assist
students in a Catholic school. See Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1, 13-14 (1993) (sign-language
translator for deaf student). If a State can furnish services
to a group of sectarian students on a neutral site adjacent to
a private religious school, or even within such a school, how
can there be any defect in educating those same students in

a public school? As the Court noted in Wolman, the consti-tutional dangers of establishment arise "from the nature of

the institution, not from the nature of the pupils," 433 U. S.,at 248. There is no danger in educating religious students
in a public school.For these very good reasons,

Justice Souter's opiniondoes not focus upon the school, but rather upon the school

district and the New York Legislature that created it. Hisarguments, though sometimes intermingled, are two: that reposing governmental power in the Kiryas Joel school districtis the same as reposing governmental power in a religious
group; and that in enacting the statute creating the district,the New York State Legislature was discriminating on the
basis of religion, i. e., favoring the Satmar Hasidim over oth-ers. I shall discuss these arguments in turn.

II
For his thesis that New York has unconstitutionally con-ferred governmental authority upon the Satmar sect,

Justice Souter relies extensively, and virtually exclusively,upon

Larkin v. Grendel's Den, Inc., 459 U. S. 116 (1982). Justice Souter believes that the present litigation "resembles"
Grendel's Den because that case "teaches that a State maynot delegate its civic authority

to a group chosen accordingto a religious criterion," ante, at 698 (emphasis added).

That misdescribes both what that case taught (which is thata State may not delegate its civil authority to a church), and
what these cases involve (which is a group chosen accordingto cultural characteristics). The statute at issue there gave
churches veto power over the State's authority to grant aliquor license to establishments in the vicinity of the church.
The Court had little difficulty finding the statute unconsti-tutional. "The Framers did not set up a system of government in which important, discretionary governmentalpowers would be delegated to or shared with religious institutions." 459 U. S., at 127.

735Cite as: 512 U. S. 687 (1994)
Scalia, J., dissenting
Justice Souter concedes that Grendel's Den "presentedan example of united civic and religious authority, an establishment rarely found in such straightforward form in mod-ern America."

Ante, at 697. The uniqueness of the case
stemmed from the grant of governmental power directly to
a religious institution, and the Court's opinion focused onthat fact, remarking that the transfer of authority was to

"churches" (10 times), the "governing body of churches"(twice), "religious institutions" (twice), and "religious bodies" (once). Astonishingly, however, Justice Souter dis-misses the difference between a transfer of government
power to citizens who share a common religion as opposed
to "the officers of its sectarian organization"--the critical
factor that made Grendel's Den unique and "rar[e]"--as
being "one of form, not substance." Ante, at 698.

Justice Souter's steamrolling of the difference between
civil authority held by a church and civil authority held by
members of a church is breathtaking. To accept it, one must
believe that large portions of the civil authority exercised
during most of our history were unconstitutional, and that
much more of it than merely the Kiryas Joel school district
is unconstitutional today. The history of the populating of
North America is in no small measure the story of groups
of people sharing a common religious and cultural heritage
striking out to form their own communities. See, e. g., W.
Sweet, The Story of Religion in America 9 (1950). It is preposterous to suggest that the civil institutions of these communities, separate from their churches, were constitutionally
suspect. And if they were, surely Justice Souter cannot
mean that the inclusion of one or two nonbelievers in the
community would have been enough to eliminate the constitutional vice. If the conferral of governmental power upon
a religious institution as such (rather than upon American
citizens who belong to the religious institution) is not the
test of Grendel's Den invalidity, there is no reason why
giving power to a body that is overwhelmingly dominated

States of Utah and New Mexico unconstitutional at the timeof their admission to the Union,

Justice Souter's position boils down to the quite novel
proposition that any group of citizens (say, the residents ofKiryas Joel) can be invested with political power, but not if

they all belong to the same religion. Of course such disfavoring of religion is positively antagonistic to the purposes
of the Religion Clauses, and we have rejected it before. In
McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U. S. 618 (1978), we invalidated a state
constitutional amendment that would have permitted all per-sons to participate in political conventions, except ministers.

We adopted James Madison's view that the State could not
" `punis[h] a religious profession with the privation of a civil
right.' " Id., at 626 (opinion of Burger, C. J.), quoting 5 Writings of James Madison 288 (G. Hunt ed. 1904). Or as Justice

1 A census taken in 1906, 10 years after statehood was granted to Utah,
and 6 years before it was granted to New Mexico, showed that in Utah
87.7% of all church members were Mormon, and in New Mexico 88.7% of
all church members were Roman Catholic. See Bureau of the Census,
Special Reports, Religious Bodies, Part I, p. 55 (1910).

2 At the county level, the smallest unit for which comprehensive data is

available, there are a number of counties in which the overwhelming majority of churchgoers are of a single religion: Rich County, Utah (100%
Mormon); Kennedy County, Texas (100% Roman Catholic); Emery County,
Utah (99.2% Mormon); Franklin and Madison Counties, Idaho (99% or
more Mormon); Graham County, North Carolina (93.7% Southern Baptist);

constitute a substantial majority, in some cases over a 95% majority, of
the total population. If data were available for smaller units of government than counties, I have no doubt I could point to hundreds of towns

Brennan put it in his opinion concurring in judgment: "Reli-gionists no less than members of any other group enjoy the

full measure of protection afforded speech, association, andpolitical activity generally." 435 U. S., at 641; see also
Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263 (1981). I see no reasonwhy it is any less pernicious to deprive a group rather than
an individual of its rights simply because of its religiousbeliefs.

Perhaps appreciating the startling implications for ourconstitutional jurisprudence of collapsing the distinction between religious institutions and their members, Justice
Souter tries to limit his "unconstitutional conferral of civilauthority" holding by pointing out several features supposedly unique to the present cases: that the "boundary linesof the school district divide residents

according to religiousaffiliation," ante, at 699 (emphasis added); that the school district was created by "a special Act of the legislature," ante,at 700; and that the formation of the school district ran counter to the legislature's trend of consolidating districts in re-cent years,

ibid. Assuming all these points to be true (andthey are not), they would certainly bear upon whether the

legislature had an impermissible religious motivation in cre-ating the district (which is

Justice Souter's next point, inthe discussion of which I shall reply to these arguments).

But they have nothing to do with whether conferral of powerupon a group of citizens can be the conferral of power upon
a religious institution. It cannot. Or if it can, our Estab-lishment Clause jurisprudence has been transformed.

III
I turn, next, to Justice Souter's second justification forfinding an establishment of religion: his facile conclusion that

the New York Legislature's creation of the Kiryas Joel schooldistrict was religiously motivated. But in the Land of the
Free, democratically adopted laws are not so easily im-peached by unelected judges. To establish the unconstitu512us3$90K 01-08-98 12:44:39 PAGES OPINPGT

Scalia, J., dissenting

tionality of a facially neutral law on the mere basis of itsasserted religiously preferential (or discriminatory) effects--

or at least to establish it in conformity with our precedents--

Justice Souter "must be able to show the absence of a
neutral, secular basis" for the law. Gillette v. United States,
401 U. S. 437, 452 (1971); see also Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 266
(1977) (facially race-neutral laws can be invalidated on thebasis of their effects only if "unexplainable on grounds other

than race").There is of course no possible doubt of a secular basis here.
The New York Legislature faced a unique problem in Kiryas
Joel: a community in which all the nonhandicapped children
attend private schools, and the physically and mentally disabled children who attend public school suffer the additional
handicap of cultural distinctiveness. It would be troublesome enough if these peculiarly dressed, handicapped students were sent to the next town, accompanied by their
similarly clad but unimpaired classmates. But all the unimpaired children of Kiryas Joel attend private school. The
handicapped children suffered sufficient emotional trauma
from their predicament that their parents kept them home
from school. Surely the legislature could target this problem, and provide a public education for these students, in the
same way it addressed, by a similar law, the unique needs of
children institutionalized in a hospital. See, e. g., 1970 N. Y.
Laws, ch. 843 (authorizing a union free school district for the
area owned by Blythedale Children's Hospital).

Since the obvious presence of a neutral, secular basis renders the asserted preferential effect of this law inadequate
to invalidate it, Justice Souter is required to come forward
with direct evidence that religious preference was the objective. His case could scarcely be weaker. It consists,
briefly, of this: The People of New York created the Kiryas
Joel Village School District in order to further the Satmar
religion, rather than for any proper secular purpose, because

(1) they created the district in an extraordinary manner--byspecial Act of the legislature, rather than under the State's

general laws governing school-district reorganization; (2) thecreation of the district ran counter to a state trend toward
consolidation of school districts; and (3) the district includes
only adherents of the Satmar religion. On this indictment,no jury would convict.

One difficulty with the first point is that it is not true.There was really nothing so "special" about the formation of
a school district by an Act of the New York Legislature.The State has created both large school districts, see,

e. g.,
1972 N. Y. Laws, ch. 928 (creating the Gananda School Dis-trict out of land previously in two other districts), and small

specialized school districts for institutionalized children, see,
e. g., 1972 N. Y. Laws, ch. 559 (creating a union free schooldistrict for the area owned by Abbott House), through these

special Acts. But in any event all that the first point proves,
and the second point as well (countering the trend toward
consolidation),3 is that New York regarded Kiryas Joel as a

3 The Court says that "[e]arly on in the development of public education
in New York, the State rejected highly localized school districts for New
York City when they were promoted as a way to allow separate schooling
for Roman Catholic children." Ante, at 704. Both the implication that
this rejection of localism was general state policy, and the implication that
(like the Court's prohibition of localism today) it had the purpose and effect of religious neutrality, are simply not faithful to the cited source. The
1841 proposal was not to treat New York City schools differently, in order
to favor Roman Catholics; it was "that the state's school code, which promoted a district system structure with local taxing authority, be extended
to New York City." R. Church & M. Sedlak, Education in the United
States 167 (1976). And the rejection of that proposal was not a triumph
for keeping sectarian religion out of some public schools; it was a triumph
for keeping the King James version of the Bible in all public schools. The
Court's selected source concludes: "[T]he Whigs swept the city elections
that year [1842] and made Bible reading--the King James version--mandatory in any schools sharing these monies. There was nothing left for
the Catholics to do but to build their own parochial system with their own
money." Id., at 168-169.

special case, requiring special measures. I should think itobvious that it did, and obvious that it should have. But

even if the New York Legislature had never before createda school district by special statute (which is not true), and
even if it had done nothing but consolidate school districtsfor over a century (which is not true), how could the departure from those past practices possibly demonstrate that thelegislature had religious favoritism in mind? It could not.
To be sure, when there is no special treatment there is nopossibility of religious favoritism; but it is not logical to suggest that when there is special treatment there is proof ofreligious favoritism.

Justice Souter's case against the statute comes down tonothing more, therefore, than his third point: the fact that
all the residents of the Kiryas Joel Village School Districtare Satmars. But all its residents also wear unusual dress,
have unusual civic customs, and have not much to do withpeople who are culturally different from them. (The Court
recognizes that "the Satmars prefer to live together `to facil-itate individual religious observance and maintain social, cultural and religious values,' but that it is not ` "against theirreligion" to interact with others.' "

Ante, at 706, n. 9, quot-ing Brief for Petitioners in No. 93-517, p. 4, n. 1.) On what

basis does Justice Souter conclude that it is the theologicaldistinctiveness rather than the cultural distinctiveness that
was the basis for New York State's decision? The normalassumption would be that it was the latter, since it was not
theology but dress, language, and cultural alienation thatposed the educational problem for the children.

Justice
Souter not only does not adopt the logical assumption, hedoes not even give the New York Legislature the benefit of

the doubt. The following is the level of his analysis:

"Not even the special needs of the children in this com-munity can explain the legislature's unusual Act, for the

State could have responded to the concerns of theSatmar parents [by other means]." Ante, at 702.

In other words, we know the legislature must have been mo-tivated by the desire to favor the Satmar Hasidim religion,

because it could have met the needs of these children by amethod that did not place the Satmar Hasidim in a separate
school district. This is not a rational argument proving religious favoritism; it is rather a novel Establishment Clauseprinciple to the effect that no secular objective may be pursued by a means that might also be used for religious favorit-ism if some other means is available.

I have little doubt that Justice Souter would laud thishumanitarian legislation if all of the distinctiveness of the
students of Kiryas Joel were attributable to the fact that
their parents were nonreligious commune dwellers, or American Indians, or gypsies. The creation of a special, oneculture school district for the benefit of those children would
pose no problem. The neutrality demanded by the Religion
Clauses requires the same indulgence towards cultural characteristics that are accompanied by religious belief. "The
Establishment Clause does not license government to treat
religion and those who teach or practice it, simply by virtue
of their status as such, as . . . subject to unique disabilities."
McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U. S., at 641 (Brennan, J., concurring
in judgment).

Even if Justice Souter could successfully establish that
the cultural distinctiveness of the Kiryas Joel students
(which is the problem the New York Legislature addressed)
was an essential part of their religious belief rather than
merely an accompaniment of their religious belief, that
would not discharge his heavy burden. In order to invalidate a facially neutral law, Justice Souter would have to
show not only that legislators were aware that religion
caused the problems addressed, but also that the legislature's
proposed solution was motivated by a desire to disadvantage
or benefit a religious group (i. e., to disadvantage or benefit
them because of their religion). For example, if the city of
Hialeah, knowing of the potential health problems raised by

the Santeria religious practice of animal sacrifice, were toprovide by ordinance a special, more frequent, municipal garbage collection for the carcasses of dead animals, we wouldnot strike the ordinance down just because the city council
was aware that a religious practice produced the problem
the ordinance addressed. See Church of Lukumi Babalu
Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 543-545 (1993). Here a
facially neutral statute extends an educational benefit to theone area where it was not effectively distributed. Whether

or not the reason for the ineffective distribution had any-thing to do with religion, it is a remarkable stretch to say
that the Act was motivated by a desire to favor or disfavor
a particular religious group. The proper analogy to Chapter
748 is not the Court's hypothetical law providing school
buses only to Christian students, see ante, at 709, but a law
providing extra buses to rural school districts (which happen
to be predominantly Southern Baptist).

At various times Justice Souter intimates, though he
does not precisely say, that the boundaries of the school district were intentionally drawn on the basis of religion. He
refers, for example, to "the State's manipulation of the franchise for this district . . . , giving the sect exclusive control
of the political subdivision," ante, at 698--implying that the
"giving" of political power to the religious sect was the object of the "manipulation." There is no evidence of that.
The special district was created to meet the special educational needs of distinctive handicapped children, and the geographical boundaries selected for that district were (quite
logically) those that already existed for the village. It
sometimes appears as though the shady "manipulation" Justice Souter has in mind is that which occurred when the
village was formed, so that the drawing of its boundaries
infected the coterminous boundaries of the district. He
says, for example, that "[i]t is undisputed that those who
negotiated the village boundaries when applying the general village incorporation statute drew them so as to exclude

all but Satmars." Ante, at 699. It is indeed. But non-Satmars were excluded, not (as he intimates) because of

their religion, but--as Justice O'Connor clearly describes,see ante, at 712--because of their lack of desire for the
high-density zoning that Satmars favored. It was a classicdrawing of lines on the basis of communality of

secular gov-ernmental desires, not communality of religion. What happened in the creation of the village is in fact precisely whathappened in the creation of the school district, so that the
former cannot possibly infect the latter, as Justice Soutertries to suggest. Entirely secular reasons (zoning for the
village, cultural alienation of students for the school district)produced a political unit whose members happened to share
the same religion. There is no evidence (indeed, no plausi-ble suspicion) of the legislature's desire to favor the Satmar
religion, as opposed to meeting distinctive secular needs ordesires of citizens who happened to be Satmars. If there
were, Justice Souter would say so; instead, he mustmerely insinuate.

IV
But even if Chapter 748 were intended to create a specialarrangement for the Satmars because of their religion (not

including, as I have shown in Part I, any conferral of gov-ernmental power upon a religious entity), it would be a permissible accommodation. "This Court has long recognizedthat the government may (and sometimes must) accommodate religious practices and that it may do so without violat-ing the Establishment Clause."

Hobbie v. UnemploymentAppeals Comm'n of Fla., 480 U. S. 136, 144-145 (1987). Moreover, "there is ample room for accommodation of religionunder the Establishment Clause,"

U. S. 664, 669 (1970). Accommodation is permissible, more-over, even when the statute deals specifically with religion,

see, e. g., Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U. S., at 312-315, and evenwhen accommodation is not commanded by the Free Exercise Clause, see, e. g., Walz, supra, at 673.

When a legislature acts to accommodate religion, particu-larly a minority sect, "it follows the best of our traditions."

Zorach, supra, at 314. The Constitution itself contains anaccommodation of sorts. Article VI, cl. 3, prescribes that
executive, legislative, and judicial officers of the Federal andState Governments shall bind themselves to support the
Constitution "by Oath or Affirmation." Although members
of the most populous religions found no difficulty in swearing
an oath to God, Quakers, Moravians, and Mennonites refused
to take oaths based on Matthew 5:34's injunction "swear not
at all." The option of affirmation was added to accommodate these minority religions and enable their members to
serve in government. See 1 A. Stokes, Church and State in
The United States 524-527 (1950). Congress, from its earliest sessions, passed laws accommodating religion by refunding duties paid by specific churches upon the importation of
plates for the printing of Bibles, see 6 Stat. 116 (1813), vestments, 6 Stat. 346 (1816), and bells, 6 Stat. 675 (1836). Congress also exempted church property from the tax assessments it levied on residents of the District of Columbia; and
all 50 States have had similar laws. See Walz, supra, at
676-678.

This Court has also long acknowledged the permissibility
of legislative accommodation. In one of our early Establishment Clause cases, we upheld New York City's early release
program, which allowed students to be released from public
school during school hours to attend religious instruction or
devotional exercises. See Zorach, supra, at 312-315. We
determined that the early release program "accommodates
the public service to . . . spiritual needs," and noted that
finding it unconstitutional would "show a callous indifference

to religious groups." 343 U. S., at 314. In Walz, supra, weupheld a property tax exemption for religious organizations,

observing that it was part of a salutary tradition of "permis-sible state accommodation to religion."

Id., at 672-673.
And in Presiding Bishop, supra, we upheld a section of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 exempting religious groups from theantidiscrimination provisions of Title VII. We concluded

that it was "a permissible legislative purpose to alleviate sig-nificant governmental interference with the ability of religious organizations to define and carry out their religiousmissions."

Id., at 335.
In today's opinion, however, the Court seems uncomfortable with this aspect of our constitutional tradition. Although it acknowledges the concept of accommodation, it
quickly points out that it is "not a principle without limits,"
ante, at 706, and then gives reasons why the present case
exceeds those limits, reasons which simply do not hold water.
"[W]e have never hinted," the Court says, "that an otherwise unconstitutional delegation of political power to a religious group could be saved as a religious accommodation."
Ibid. Putting aside the circularity inherent in referring to a
delegation as "otherwise unconstitutional" when its constitutionality turns on whether there is an accommodation, if this
statement is true, it is only because we have never hinted
that delegation of political power to citizens who share a particular religion could be unconstitutional. This is simply a
replay of the argument we rejected in Part II, supra.

The second and last reason the Court finds accommodation
impermissible is, astoundingly, the mere risk that the State
will not offer accommodation to a similar group in the future,
and that neutrality will therefore not be preserved. Returning to the ill fitted crutch of Grendel's Den, the Court
suggests that by acting through this special statute the New
York Legislature has eliminated any " `effective means of
guaranteeing' that governmental power will be and has
been neutrally employed." Ante, at 703, quoting Grendel's

Den, 459 U. S., at 125. How misleading. That language in
Grendel's Den was an expression of concern not (as the
context in which it is quoted suggests) about the courts'ability to assure the legislature's future neutrality, but about

the legislature's ability to assure the neutrality of the
churches to which it had transferred legislative power.That concern is inapposite here; there is no doubt about

the legislature's capacity to control what transpires in a pub-lic school.

At bottom, the Court's "no guarantee of neutrality" argu-ment is an assertion of

this Court's inability to control the
New York Legislature's future denial of comparable accom-modation. We have "no assurance," the Court says, "that

the next similarly situated group seeking a school district of
its own will receive one," since "a legislature's failure toenact a special law is . . . unreviewable."

Ante, at 703; see
also ante, at 716 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).4 That is true only in the technical
(and irrelevant) sense that the later group denied an accommodation may need to challenge the grant of the first accommodation in light of the later denial, rather than challenging
the denial directly. But one way or another, "even if
[an administrative agency is] not empowered or obliged to
act, [a litigant] would be entitled to a judicial audience.
Ultimately, the courts cannot escape the obligation to address [a] plea that the exemption [sought] is mandated by
the first amendment's religion clauses." Olsen v. Drug
Enforcement Admin., 878 F. 2d 1458, 1461 (CADC 1989)
(R. B. Ginsburg, J.).

4 The Court hints, ante, at 703, that its fears would have been allayed if
the New York Legislature had previously created similar school districts
for other minority religions. But had it done so, each of them would have
been attacked (and invalidated) for the same reason as this one: because
it had no antecedents. I am sure the Court has in mind some way around
this chicken-and-egg problem. Perhaps the legislature could name the
first four school districts in pectore.

The Court's demand for "up front" assurances of a neutralsystem is at war with both traditional accommodation doctrine and the judicial role. As we have described, supra, at744, Congress's earliest accommodations exempted duties
paid by specific churches on particular items. See, e. g., 6Stat. 346 (1826) (exempting vestments imported by "bishop
of Bardstown"). Moreover, most efforts at accommodationseek to solve a problem that applies to members of only one
or a few religions. Not every religion uses wine in its sacra-ments, but that does not make an exemption from Prohibition for sacramental wine use impermissible, accord, Church
of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S., at 561,n. 2 (

Souter, J., concurring in judgment), nor does it requirethe State granting such an exemption to explain in advance

how it will treat every other claim for dispensation from itscontrolled-substances laws. Likewise, not every religion
uses peyote in its services, but we have suggested that legis-lation which exempts the sacramental use of peyote from
generally applicable drug laws is not only permissible, butdesirable, see

Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resourcesof Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872, 890 (1990), without any suggestion that some "up front" legislative guarantee of equaltreatment for sacramental substances used by other sects
must be provided. The record is clear that the necessaryguarantee can and will be provided, after the fact, by the
courts. See, e. g., Olsen v. Drug Enforcement Admin.,
supra (rejecting claim that peyote exemption requires mari-juana exemption for Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church); Olsen v.

Iowa, 808 F. 2d 652 (CA8 1986) (same); Kennedy v. Bureauof Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, 459 F. 2d 415 (CA9 1972)
(accepting claim that peyote exemption for Native AmericanChurch requires peyote exemption for other religions that
use that substance in their sacraments).5

5 The Court likens its demand for "up front" assurances to the Court's
focus on the narrowness of the statute it struck down in Texas Monthly,

SCHOOL DIST. v. GRUMET

Scalia, J., dissenting

Contrary to the Court's suggestion, ante, at 708-709, I donot think that the Establishment Clause prohibits formally

established "state" churches and nothing more. I have al-ways believed, and all my opinions are consistent with the
view, that the Establishment Clause prohibits the favoringof one religion over others. In this respect, it is the Court
that attacks lions of straw. What I attack is the Court'simposition of novel "up front" procedural requirements on
state legislatures. Making law (and making exceptions) onecase at a time, whether through adjudication or through
highly particularized rulemaking or legislation, violates, ex
ante, no principle of fairness, equal protection, or neutralitysimply because it does not announce in advance how all future cases (and all future exceptions) will be disposed of. Ifit did, the manner of proceeding of this Court itself would
be unconstitutional. It is presumptuous for this Court toimpose--

out of nowhere--an unheard-of prohibition againstproceeding in this manner upon the Legislature of New York

State. I never heard of such a principle, nor has anyoneelse, nor will it ever be heard of again. Unlike what the
New York Legislature has done, this is a special rule togovern only the Satmar Hasidim.

V
A few words in response to the separate concurrences:
Justice Stevens adopts, for these cases, a rationale that is

bears no resemblance to today's opinion, except that it also was wrong and
it also misinterpreted Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U. S.
664 (1970), see 489 U. S., at 33-40 (Scalia, J., dissenting). The tax treatment of publishing companies in Texas was governed by an across-theboard rule. There was never any question whether nonreligious publishers would get the tax exemption accorded to religious publishers; by
rule they did not, and the Court struck down that rule because it discriminated in favor of religion. By contrast, adjustments to existing school
districts in New York are done case by case. No decision, including Texas
Monthly, remotely suggests that approaching accommodations in a casespecific manner automatically violates the Establishment Clause.

almost without limit. The separate Kiryas Joel school dis-trict is problematic in his view because "[t]he isolation of

these children, while it may protect them from `panic, fearand trauma,' also unquestionably increased the likelihood
that they would remain within the fold, faithful adherents oftheir parents' religious faith."

Ante, at 711. So much forfamily values. If the Constitution forbids any state action

that incidentally helps parents to raise their children in theirown religious faith, it would invalidate a release program
permitting public school children to attend the religious-instruction program of their parents' choice, of the sort we
approved in Zorach; 6 indeed, it would invalidate state lawsaccording parents physical control over their children, at
least insofar as that is used to take the little fellows to churchor synagogue.

Justice Stevens' statement is less a legalanalysis than a manifesto of secularism. It surpasses mere

rejection of accommodation, and announces a positive hostil-ity to religion--which, unlike all other noncriminal values,
the State must not assist parents in transmitting to theiroffspring.

Justice Kennedy's "political-line-drawing" approachfounders on its own terms. He concedes that the Constitution does not prevent people who share a faith from formingtheir own villages and towns, and suggests that the formation of the village of Kiryas Joel was free from defect. Ante,at 729-730. He also notes that States are free to draw political lines on the basis of history and geography. Ante, at730. I do not see, then, how a school district drawn to mirror the boundaries of an existing village (an existing geo-graphic line), which itself is not infirm, can violate the Constitution. Thus, while Justice Kennedy purports to sharemy criticism (Part IV, supra) of the Court's unprecedented
insistence that the New York Legislature make its accommo6 Justice Stevens' bald statement that such a program would be permissible, see ante, at 711-712, can exclude it from the reach of his opinion,
but not from the reach of his logic.

dations only by general legislation, see ante, at 722, 726, his
own approach is little different. He says the village is constitutional because it was formed (albeit by members of a
single religious sect) under a general New York law; but he
finds the school district unconstitutional because it was the
product of a specific enactment. In the end, his analysis is
no different from the Court's.

Justice Kennedy expresses the view that School Dist.
of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373 (1985), and Aguilar
v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402 (1985)--the cases that created the
need for the Kiryas Joel legislation by holding unconstitutional state provision of supplemental educational services
in sectarian schools--"may have been erroneous," and he
suggests that "it may be necessary for us to reconsider them
at a later date." Ante, at 731. Justice O'Connor goes
even further and expresses the view that Aguilar should be
overruled. Ante, at 717-718. I heartily agree that these
cases, so hostile to our national tradition of accommodation,
should be overruled at the earliest opportunity; but meanwhile, today's opinion causes us to lose still further ground,
and in the same antiaccommodationist direction.

Finally, Justice O'Connor observes that the Court's
opinion does not focus on the so-called Lemon test, see
Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971), and she urges that
that test be abandoned, at least as a "unitary approach" to
all Establishment Clause claims, ante, at 721. I have previously documented the Court's convenient relationship with
Lemon, which it cites only when useful, see Lamb's Chapel
v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384,
397-401 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment), and I no
longer take any comfort in the Court's failure to rely on it in
any particular case, as I once mistakenly did, see Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 644 (1992) (Scalia, J., dissenting). But
the Court's snub of Lemon today (it receives only two "see

Grendel's Den) is particularly noteworthy because all three
courts below (who are not free to ignore Supreme Court
precedent at will) relied on it, and the parties (also bound
by our case law) dedicated over 80 pages of briefing to the
application and continued vitality of the Lemon test. In addition to the other sound reasons for abandoning Lemon, see,
e. g., Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578, 636-640 (1987)
(Scalia, J., dissenting); Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 108-
112 (1985) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), it seems quite inefficient for this Court, which in reaching its decisions relies
heavily on the briefing of the parties and, to a lesser extent,
the opinions of lower courts, to mislead lower courts and parties about the relevance of the Lemon test. Compare ante,
p. 687 (ignoring Lemon despite lower courts' reliance), with
Lamb's Chapel, supra (applying Lemon despite failure of
lower court to mention it).

Unlike Justice O'Connor, however, I would not replace
Lemon with nothing, and let the case law "evolve" into a
series of situation-specific rules (government speech on religious topics, government benefits to particular groups, etc.)
unconstrained by any "rigid influence," ante, at 721. The
problem with (and the allure of) Lemon has not been that it
is "rigid," but rather that in many applications it has been
utterly meaningless, validating whatever result the Court
would desire. See Lamb's Chapel, supra, at 399 (Scalia, J.,
concurring in judgment); Wallace, supra, at 110-111 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). To replace Lemon with nothing is
simply to announce that we are now so bold that we no
longer feel the need even to pretend that our haphazard
course of Establishment Clause decisions is governed by any
principle. The foremost principle I would apply is fidelity
to the longstanding traditions of our people, which surely
provide the diversity of treatment that Justice O'Connor
seeks, but do not leave us to our own devices.

religion. In order to invalidate it, the Court casts aside, onthe flimsiest of evidence, the strong presumption of validity
that attaches to facially neutral laws, and invalidates thepresent accommodation because it does not trust New York
to be as accommodating toward other religions (presumablythose less powerful than the Satmar Hasidim) in the future.

MADSEN et al. v. WOMEN'S HEALTH CENTER,INC.,

et al.

certiorari to the supreme court of florida

No. 93-880. Argued April 28, 1994--Decided June 30, 1994
After petitioners and other antiabortion protesters threatened to picket

and demonstrate around a Florida abortion clinic, a state court permanently enjoined petitioners from blocking or interfering with public access to the clinic, and from physically abusing persons entering or leaving it. Later, when respondent clinic operators sought to broaden the
injunction, the court found that access to the clinic was still being impeded, that petitioners' activities were having deleterious physical effects on patients and discouraging some potential patients from entering
the clinic, and that doctors and clinic workers were being subjected to
protests at their homes. Accordingly, the court issued an amended injunction, which applies to petitioners and persons acting "in concert"
with them, and which, inter alia, excludes demonstrators from a 36-foot
buffer zone around the clinic entrances and driveway and the private
property to the north and west of the clinic; restricts excessive noisemaking within the earshot of, and the use of "images observable" by,
patients inside the clinic; prohibits protesters within a 300-foot zone
around the clinic from approaching patients and potential patients who
do not consent to talk; and creates a 300-foot buffer zone around the
residences of clinic staff. In upholding the amended injunction against
petitioners' claim that it violated their First Amendment right to freedom of speech, the Florida Supreme Court recognized that the forum at
issue is a traditional public forum; refused to apply the heightened scrutiny dictated by Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460
U. S. 37, 45, because the injunction's restrictions are content neutral;
and concluded that the restrictions were narrowly tailored to serve a
significant government interest and left open ample alternative channels
of communication, see ibid.

Held:

1. The injunction at issue is not subject to heightened scrutiny as
content or viewpoint based simply because it restricts only the speech
of antiabortion protesters. To accept petitioners' claim to the contrary
would be to classify virtually every injunction as content based. An
injunction, by its very nature, does not address the general public, but
applies only to particular parties, regulating their activities, and perhaps their speech, because of their past actions in the context of a spe512us3$91Z 12-28-97 17:25:10 PAGES OPINPGT

Syllabus
cific dispute. The fact that this injunction did not prohibit activities by
persons demonstrating in favor of abortion is justly attributable to the
lack of such demonstrations and of any consequent request for relief.
Moreover, none of the restrictions at issue were directed at the content
of petitioners' antiabortion message. The principal inquiry in determining content neutrality is whether the government has regulated
speech without reference to its content. See, e. g., Ward v. Rock
Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791. The government's purpose is
therefore the threshold consideration. Here, the injunction imposed incidental restrictions on petitioners' message because they repeatedly
violated the original injunction. That the injunction covers people who
all share the same viewpoint suggests only that those in the group
whose conduct violated the court's order happen to share that viewpoint. Pp. 762-764.

2. In evaluating a content-neutral injunction, the governing standard
is whether the injunction's challenged provisions burden no more speech
than necessary to serve a significant government interest. See, e. g.,
Carroll v. President and Comm'rs of Princess Anne, 393 U. S. 175, 184.
Thus, the injunction must be couched in the narrowest terms that will
accomplish its pinpointed objective. See id., at 183. Although the
forum around the clinic is a traditional public forum, the obvious differences between a generally applicable ordinance--which represents a
legislative choice to promote particular societal interests--and an injunction--which remedies an actual or threatened violation of a legislative or judicial decree, and carries greater risks of censorship and discriminatory application than an ordinance, but can be tailored to afford
greater relief where a violation of law has already occurred--require a
somewhat more stringent application of general First Amendment principles in this context than traditional time, place, and manner analysis
allows. The combination of the governmental interests identified by
the Florida Supreme Court--protecting a pregnant woman's freedom to
seek lawful medical or counseling services, ensuring public safety and
order, promoting the free flow of traffic on public streets and sidewalks,
protecting citizens' property rights, and assuring residential privacy--
is quite sufficient to justify an appropriately tailored injunction.
Pp. 764-768.

3. Given the focus of the picketing on patients and clinic staff, the
narrowness of the confines around the clinic, the fact that protesters
could still be seen and heard from the clinic parking lots, and the failure
of the first injunction to accomplish its purpose, the 36-foot buffer zone
around the clinic entrances and driveway, on balance, burdens no more
speech than necessary to accomplish the governmental interests in protecting access to the clinic and facilitating an orderly traffic flow on the

street. The need for a complete buffer zone may be debatable, but
some deference must be given to the state court's familiarity with the
facts and the background of the dispute even under heightened review.
Petitioners argued against including the factual record as an appendix
in the Florida Supreme Court, and never certified a full record. This
Court must therefore judge the case on the assumption that the evidence and testimony presented to the state court supported its findings
that the protesters' activities near the clinic's entrance interfered with
access despite the earlier injunction. Pp. 768-771.

4. However, the 36-foot buffer zone as applied to the private property
to the north and west of the clinic burdens more speech than necessary
to protect access to the clinic. Patients and staff wishing to reach the
clinic do not have to cross that property. Moreover, nothing in the record indicates that petitioners' activities on the property have obstructed
clinic access, blocked vehicular traffic, or otherwise unlawfully interfered with the clinic's operation. P. 771.

5. The limited noise restrictions imposed by the injunction burden no
more speech than necessary to ensure the health and well-being of the
clinic's patients. Noise control is particularly important around medical
facilities during surgery and recovery periods. The First Amendment
does not demand that patients at such a facility undertake Herculean
efforts to escape the cacophony of political protests. Pp. 772-773.

6. The blanket ban on "images observable" sweeps more broadly than
necessary to accomplish the goals of limiting threats to clinic patients
or their families and reducing the patients' level of anxiety and hypertension inside the clinic. Prohibiting the display of signs that could be
interpreted as threats or veiled threats would satisfy the first goal,
while a clinic could simply pull its curtains to protect a patient bothered
by a disagreeable placard. P. 773.

7. Absent evidence that the protesters' speech is independently proscribable (i. e., "fighting words" or threats), or is so infused with violence
as to be indistinguishable from a threat of physical harm, the 300-foot
no-approach zone around the clinic--and particularly its consent requirement--burdens more speech than is necessary to accomplish the
goals of preventing intimidation and ensuring access to the clinic.
Pp. 773-774.

8. The 300-foot buffer zone around staff residences sweeps more
broadly than is necessary to protect the tranquility and privacy of the
home. The record does not contain sufficient justification for so broad
a ban on picketing; it appears that a limitation on the time, duration
of picketing, and number of pickets outside a smaller zone could have
accomplished the desired results. As to the use of sound amplification
equipment within the zone, however, the government may demand that

petitioners turn down the volume if the protests overwhelm the neighborhood. Pp. 774-775.

9. Petitioners, as named parties in the injunction, lack standing to
challenge its "in concert" provision as applied to persons who are not
parties. Moreover, that phrase is not subject, at petitioners' behest, to
a challenge for "overbreadth." See Regal Knitwear Co. v. NLRB, 324
U. S. 9, 14-15. Nor does the "in concert" provision impermissibly burden their freedom of association. They are not enjoined from associating with others or from joining with them to express a particular viewpoint, and the First Amendment does not protect joining with others to
deprive third parties of their lawful rights. Pp. 775-776.

Opinion of the Court
Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

Petitioners challenge the constitutionality of an injunctionentered by a Florida state court which prohibits antiabortion
protesters from demonstrating in certain places and in vari-ous ways outside of a health clinic that performs abortions.
We hold that the establishment of a 36-foot buffer zone on apublic street from which demonstrators are excluded passes
muster under the First Amendment, but that several otherprovisions of the injunction do not.

Opinion of the Court
engaged in activities near the site of one such clinic in Melbourne, Florida. They picketed and demonstrated where
the public street gives access to the clinic. In September
1992, a Florida state court permanently enjoined petitioners
from blocking or interfering with public access to the clinic,
and from physically abusing persons entering or leaving the
clinic. Six months later, respondents sought to broaden the
injunction, complaining that access to the clinic was still impeded by petitioners' activities and that such activities had
also discouraged some potential patients from entering the
clinic, and had deleterious physical effects on others. The
trial court thereupon issued a broader injunction, which is
challenged here.

The court found that, despite the initial injunction, protesters continued to impede access to the clinic by congregating on the paved portion of the street--Dixie Way--leading
up to the clinic, and by marching in front of the clinic's driveways. It found that as vehicles heading toward the clinic
slowed to allow the protesters to move out of the way, "sidewalk counselors" would approach and attempt to give the
vehicle's occupants antiabortion literature. The number of
people congregating varied from a handful to 400, and the
noise varied from singing and chanting to the use of loudspeakers and bullhorns.

The protests, the court found, took their toll on the clinic's
patients. A clinic doctor testified that, as a result of having
to run such a gauntlet to enter the clinic, the patients "manifested a higher level of anxiety and hypertension causing
those patients to need a higher level of sedation to undergo
the surgical procedures, thereby increasing the risk associated with such procedures." App. 54. The noise produced
by the protesters could be heard within the clinic, causing
stress in the patients both during surgical procedures and
while recuperating in the recovery rooms. And those patients who turned away because of the crowd to return at a

Opinion of the Court
later date, the doctor testified, increased their health risksby reason of the delay.

Doctors and clinic workers, in turn, were not immune evenin their homes. Petitioners picketed in front of clinic employees' residences; shouted at passersby; rang the doorbellsof neighbors and provided literature identifying the particular clinic employee as a "baby killer." Occasionally, the pro-testers would confront minor children of clinic employees
who were home alone.This and similar testimony led the state court to conclude
that its original injunction had proved insufficient "to pro-tect the health, safety and rights of women in Brevard and
Seminole County, Florida and surrounding counties seekingaccess to [medical and counseling] services." Id., at 5. The
state court therefore amended its prior order, enjoining abroader array of activities. The amended injunction prohibits petitioners 1 from engaging in the following acts:

"(1) At all times on all days, from entering the prem-ises and property of the Aware Woman Center for

Choice [the Melbourne clinic] . . . ."(2) At all times on all days, from blocking, impeding,
inhibiting, or in any other manner obstructing or inter-fering with access to, ingress into and egress from any
building or parking lot of the Clinic."(3) At all times on all days, from congregating, picketing, patrolling, demonstrating or entering that portionof public right-of-way or private property within [36]
feet of the property line of the Clinic . . . . An exceptionto the 36 foot buffer zone is the area immediately adjacent to the Clinic on the east . . . . The [petitioners] . . .must remain at least [5] feet from the Clinic's east line.

1 In addition to petitioners, the state court's order was directed at
"Operation Rescue, Operation Rescue America, Operation Goliath, their
officers, agents, members, employees and servants, and . . . Bruce Cadle,
Pat Mahoney, Randall Terry, . . . and all persons acting in concert or participation with them, or on their behalf." App. 56.

Opinion of the Court
Another exception to the 36 foot buffer zone relates tothe record title owners of the property to the north and

west of the Clinic. The prohibition against entry intothe 36 foot buffer zones does not apply to such persons
and their invitees. The other prohibitions contained
herein do apply, if such owners and their invitees areacting in concert with the [petitioners]. . . .

"(4) During the hours of 7:30 a.m. through noon, onMondays through Saturdays, during surgical procedures
and recovery periods, from singing, chanting, whistling,shouting, yelling, use of bullhorns, auto horns, sound amplification equipment or other sounds or images observable to or within earshot of the patients inside the Clinic.

"(5) At all times on all days, in an area within [300]
feet of the Clinic, from physically approaching any person seeking the services of the Clinic unless such person
indicates a desire to communicate by approaching or by
inquiring of the [petitioners]. . . .

"(6) At all times on all days, from approaching, congregating, picketing, patrolling, demonstrating or using
bullhorns or other sound amplification equipment within
[300] feet of the residence of any of the [respondents']
employees, staff, owners or agents, or blocking or attempting to block, barricade, or in any other manner,
temporarily or otherwise, obstruct the entrances, exits
or driveways of the residences of any of the [respondents'] employees, staff, owners or agents. The [petitioners] and those acting in concert with them are prohibited from inhibiting or impeding or attempting to
impede, temporarily or otherwise, the free ingress or
egress of persons to any street that provides the sole
access to the street on which those residences are
located.

The Florida Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality ofthe trial court's amended injunction. 626 So. 2d 664. That
court recognized that the forum at issue, which consists ofpublic streets, sidewalks, and rights-of-way, is a traditional
public forum. Id., at 671, citing Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S.474, 480 (1988). It then determined that the restrictions are
content neutral, and it accordingly refused to apply theheightened scrutiny dictated by

Perry Ed. Assn. v. PerryLocal Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 45 (1983) (To enforce a

content-based exclusion the State must show that its regula-tion is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and
that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end). Instead, thecourt analyzed the injunction to determine whether the restrictions are "narrowly tailored to serve a significant gov-ernment interest, and leave open ample alternative channels
of communication." Ibid. It concluded that they were.Shortly before the Florida Supreme Court's opinion was
announced, the United States Court of Appeals for the Elev-enth Circuit heard a separate challenge to the same injunction. The Court of Appeals struck down the injunction,characterizing the dispute as a clash "between an actual prohibition of speech and a potential hinderance to the free ex-ercise of abortion rights."

Opinion of the Court
711 (1993). It stated that the asserted interests in publicsafety and order were already protected by other applicable

laws and that these interests could be protected adequatelywithout infringing upon the First Amendment rights of
others. Ibid. The Court of Appeals found the injunctionto be content based and neither necessary to serve a compelling state interest nor narrowly drawn to achieve that end.
Ibid., citing Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 461-462 (1980).We granted certiorari, 510 U. S. 1084 (1994), to resolve the

conflict between the Florida Supreme Court and the Courtof Appeals over the constitutionality of the state court's
injunction. II

We begin by addressing petitioners' contention that thestate court's order, because it is an injunction that restricts
only the speech of antiabortion protesters, is necessarily con-tent or viewpoint based. Accordingly, they argue, we
should examine the entire injunction under the stricteststandard of scrutiny. See

Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 45.We disagree. To accept petitioners' claim would be to classify virtually every injunction as content or viewpoint based.An injunction, by its very nature, applies only to a particular
group (or individuals) and regulates the activities, and per-haps the speech, of that group. It does so, however, because
of the group's past actions in the context of a specific disputebetween real parties. The parties seeking the injunction assert a violation of their rights; the court hearing the actionis charged with fashioning a remedy for a specific deprivation, not with the drafting of a statute addressed to the gen-eral public.

The fact that the injunction in the present case did notprohibit activities of those demonstrating in favor of abortion
is justly attributable to the lack of any similar demonstra-tions by those in favor of abortion, and of any consequent
request that their demonstrations be regulated by injunc-tion. There is no suggestion in this record that Florida law

763Cite as: 512 U. S. 753 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
would not equally restrain similar conduct directed at a tar-get having nothing to do with abortion; none of the restrictions imposed by the court were directed at the contents ofpetitioner's message.

Our principal inquiry in determining content neutrality iswhether the government has adopted a regulation of speech
"without reference to the content of the regulated speech."
Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989) (in-ternal quotation marks omitted) (upholding noise regulations); R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 386 (1992) ("Thegovernment may not regulate [speech] based on hostility--
or favoritism--towards the underlying message expressed");
see also Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481U. S. 221, 230 (1987);

Regan v. Time, Inc., 468 U. S. 641, 648-
649 (1984); Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U. S. 490,514-515 (1981) (plurality opinion);

Carey v. Brown, supra, at
466-468. We thus look to the government's purpose as thethreshold consideration. Here, the state court imposed restrictions on petitioners incidental to their antiabortion mes-sage because they repeatedly violated the court's original
order. That petitioners all share the same viewpoint regarding abortion does not in itself demonstrate that someinvidious content- or viewpoint-based purpose motivated the

issuance of the order. It suggests only that those in thegroup

whose conduct violated the court's order happen to
share the same opinion regarding abortions being performedat the clinic. In short, the fact that the injunction covered

people with a particular viewpoint does not itself render theinjunction content or viewpoint based. See

Boos v. Barry,
485 U. S. 312 (1988).2 Accordingly, the injunction issued in

2 We also decline to adopt the prior restraint analysis urged by petitioners. Prior restraints do often take the form of injunctions. See, e. g.,
New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U. S. 713 (1971) (refusing to
enjoin publications of the "Pentagon Papers"); Vance v. Universal Amusement Co., 445 U. S. 308 (1980) (per curiam) (holding that Texas public
nuisance statute which authorized state judges, on the basis of a showing

Opinion of the Court
this case does not demand the level of heightened scrutinyset forth in Perry Ed. Assn., 460 U. S., at 45. And we proceed to discuss the standard which does govern.

III
If this were a content-neutral, generally applicable statute,instead of an injunctive order, its constitutionality would be

assessed under the standard set forth in Ward v. RockAgainst Racism, supra, at 791, and similar cases. Given
that the forum around the clinic is a traditional public forum,see Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S., at 480, we would determine
whether the time, place, and manner regulations were "nar-rowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest."
Ward, supra, at 791. See also Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 45.There are obvious differences, however, between an injunction and a generally applicable ordinance. Ordinancesrepresent a legislative choice regarding the promotion of
particular societal interests. Injunctions, by contrast, areremedies imposed for violations (or threatened violations) of
a legislative or judicial decree. See United States v. W. T.
Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629, 632-633 (1953). Injunctions alsocarry greater risks of censorship and discriminatory application than do general ordinances. "[T]here is no more effec-tive practical guaranty against arbitrary and unreasonable
government than to require that the principles of law whichofficials would impose upon a minority must be imposed generally." Railway Express Agency, Inc. v. New York, 336
that a theater had exhibited obscene films in the past, to enjoin its future
exhibition of films not yet found to be obscene was unconstitutional as
authorizing an invalid prior restraint). Not all injunctions that may incidentally affect expression, however, are "prior restraints" in the sense
that that term was used in New York Times Co., supra, or Vance, supra.
Here petitioners are not prevented from expressing their message in any
one of several different ways; they are simply prohibited from expressing
it within the 36-foot buffer zone. Moreover, the injunction was issued not
because of the content of petitioners' expression, as was the case in New
York Times Co. and Vance, but because of their prior unlawful conduct.

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 106, 112-113 (1949). Injunctions, of course, have someadvantages over generally applicable statutes in that they

can be tailored by a trial judge to afford more precise reliefthan a statute where a violation of the law has already occurred. United States v. Paradise, 480 U. S. 149 (1987).We believe that these differences require a somewhat
more stringent application of general First Amendmentprinciples in this context.

3 In past cases evaluating injunctions restricting speech, see, e. g., NAACP v. Claiborne
Hardware Co., 458 U. S. 886 (1982), Milk Wagon Drivers v.Meadowmoor Dairies, Inc., 312 U. S. 287 (1941), we have

relied upon such general principles while also seeking toensure that the injunction was no broader than necessary
to achieve its desired goals. See Carroll v. President and
Comm'rs of Princess Anne, 393 U. S. 175 (1968); ClaiborneHardware, supra, at 912, n. 47. Our close attention to the

fit between the objectives of an injunction and the restric-tions it imposes on speech is consistent with the general rule,
quite apart from First Amendment considerations, "that in-junctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plain-tiffs."

Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 702 (1979). Seealso Dayton Bd. of Ed. v. Brinkman, 433 U. S. 406, 418-420

(1977). Accordingly, when evaluating a content-neutral in-junction, we think that our standard time, place, and manner
analysis is not sufficiently rigorous. We must ask insteadwhether the challenged provisions of the injunction burden
no more speech than necessary to serve a significant govern-ment interest. See,

e. g., Claiborne Hardware, supra, at 916(when sanctionable "conduct occurs in the context of constitutionally protected activity . . . `precision of regulation' is

3 Under general equity principles, an injunction issues only if there is a
showing that the defendant has violated, or imminently will violate, some
provision of statutory or common law, and that there is a "cognizable danger of recurrent violation." United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U. S.

Carroll, supra, at 183-184.
Both Justice Stevens and Justice Scalia disagree
with the standard we announce, for policy reasons. See
post, at 778 (Stevens, J.); post, at 792-794 (Scalia, J.).
Justice Stevens believes that "injunctive relief should bejudged by a more lenient standard than legislation," because

injunctions are imposed on individuals or groups who haveengaged in illegal activity.

Post, at 778. Justice Scalia,
by contrast, believes that content-neutral injunctions are "at
least as deserving of strict scrutiny as a statutory, contentbased restriction." Post, at 792. Justice Scalia bases his
belief on the danger that injunctions, even though they might
not "attack content as content," may be used to suppress
particular ideas; that individual judges should not be trusted
to impose injunctions in this context; and that an injunction
is procedurally more difficult to challenge than a statute.
Post, at 793-794. We believe that consideration of all of the
differences and similarities between statutes and injunctions
supports, as a matter of policy, the standard we apply here.

Justice Scalia further contends that precedent compels
the application of strict scrutiny in this case. Under that
standard, we ask whether a restriction is " `necessary to
serve a compelling state interest and [is] narrowly drawn to
achieve that end.' " Post, at 790 (quoting Perry Ed. Assn.,
supra, at 45). Justice Scalia fails to cite a single case,
and we are aware of none, in which we have applied this
standard to a content-neutral injunction. He cites a number
of cases in which we have struck down, with little or no elaboration, prior restraints on free expression. See post, at 798
(citing cases). As we have explained, however, we do not
believe that this injunction constitutes a prior restraint, and
we therefore believe that the "heavy presumption" against
its constitutionality does not obtain here. See n. 2, supra.

767Cite as: 512 U. S. 753 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
Justice Scalia also relies on Claiborne Hardware and
Carroll for support of his contention that our precedent requires the application of strict scrutiny in this context. In
Claiborne Hardware, we stated simply that "precision of
regulation" is demanded. 458 U. S., at 916 (internal quotation marks omitted). Justice Scalia reads this case to require "surgical precision" of regulation, post, at 798, but that
was not the adjective chosen by the author of the Court's
opinion, Justice Stevens. We think a standard requiring
that an injunction "burden no more speech than necessary"
exemplifies "precision of regulation." 4

As for Carroll, Justice Scalia believes that the "standard" adopted in that case "is strict scrutiny," which "does
not remotely resemble the Court's new proposal." Post, at
799. Comparison of the language used in Carroll and the
wording of the standard we adopt, however, belies Justice
Scalia's exaggerated contention. Carroll, for example,
requires that an injunction be "couched in the narrowest
terms that will accomplish the pin-pointed objective" of the
injunction. 393 U. S., at 183. We require that the injunction "burden no more speech than necessary" to accomplish
its objective. We fail to see a difference between the two
standards.

The Florida Supreme Court concluded that numerous
significant government interests are protected by the injunction. It noted that the State has a strong interest in
protecting a woman's freedom to seek lawful medical or

Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589

demanded the different treatment of statutes and injunctions, as Justice

Opinion of the Court
Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973); In re T. W., 551 So. 2d 1186,1193 (Fla. 1989). The State also has a strong interest in

ensuring the public safety and order, in promoting the freeflow of traffic on public streets and sidewalks, and in protecting the property rights of all its citizens. 626 So. 2d, at 672.In addition, the court believed that the State's strong interest in residential privacy, acknowledged in Frisby v. Schultz,487 U. S. 474 (1988), applied by analogy to medical privacy.
626 So. 2d, at 672. The court observed that while targetedpicketing of the home threatens the psychological well-being
of the "captive" resident, targeted picketing of a hospital orclinic threatens not only the psychological, but also the physical, well-being of the patient held "captive" by medical cir-cumstance. Id., at 673. We agree with the Supreme Court
of Florida that the combination of these governmental inter-ests is quite sufficient to justify an appropriately tailored injunction to protect them. We now examine each contestedprovision of the injunction to see if it burdens more speech
than necessary to accomplish its goal.5

We begin with the 36-foot buffer zone. The state courtprohibited petitioners from "congregating, picketing, patrolling, demonstrating or entering" any portion of the publicright-of-way or private property within 36 feet of the property line of the clinic as a way of ensuring access to the clinic.This speech-free buffer zone requires that petitioners move

5 Petitioners do not challenge the first two provisions of the state court's
1993 order. Brief for Petitioners 9. The provisions composed what had
been the state court's 1992 permanent injunction and they chiefly addressed blocking, impeding, and inhibiting access to the clinic and its parking lot. Nor do petitioners challenge the restrictions in paragraphs 7, 8,
and 9, which prohibit them from harassing and physically abusing clinic
doctors, staff, and patients trying to gain access to the clinic or their
homes.

Opinion of the Court
to the other side of Dixie Way and away from the drivewayof the clinic, where the state court found that they repeatedly had interfered with the free access of patients and staff.App. to Pet. for Cert. B-2, B-3. See

Cameron v. Johnson,
390 U. S. 611 (1968) (upholding statute that prohibited picketing that obstructed or unreasonably interfered with ingressor egress to or from public buildings, including courthouses,

and with traffic on the adjacent street sidewalks). Thebuffer zone also applies to private property to the north and
west of the clinic property. We examine each portion of thebuffer zone separately.

We have noted a distinction between the type of focused
picketing banned from the buffer zone and the type of generally disseminated communication that cannot be completely
banned in public places, such as handbilling and solicitation.
See Frisby, supra, at 486 ("The type of focused picketing
prohibited by [the state court injunction] is fundamentally
different from more generally directed means of communication that may not be completely banned in [public places]").
Here the picketing is directed primarily at patients and staff
of the clinic.

The 36-foot buffer zone protecting the entrances to the
clinic and the parking lot is a means of protecting unfettered
ingress to and egress from the clinic, and ensuring that petitioners do not block traffic on Dixie Way. The state court
seems to have had few other options to protect access given
the narrow confines around the clinic. As the Florida Supreme Court noted, Dixie Way is only 21 feet wide in the
area of the clinic. App. 260, 305. The state court was convinced that allowing petitioners to remain on the clinic's
sidewalk and driveway was not a viable option in view of the
failure of the first injunction to protect access. And allowing the petitioners to stand in the middle of Dixie Way would
obviously block vehicular traffic.

The need for a complete buffer zone near the clinic entrances and driveway may be debatable, but some deference

770 MADSEN v. WOMEN'S HEALTH CENTER, INC.

Opinion of the Court
must be given to the state court's familiarity with the factsand the background of the dispute between the parties even

under our heightened review. Milk Wagon Drivers, 312U. S., at 294. Moreover, one of petitioners' witnesses during
the evidentiary hearing before the state court conceded that
the buffer zone was narrow enough to place petitioners at adistance of no greater than 10 to 12 feet from cars approaching and leaving the clinic. App. 486. Protesters standingacross the narrow street from the clinic can still be seen and
heard from the clinic parking lots. Id., at 260, 305. We alsobear in mind the fact that the state court originally issued a
much narrower injunction, providing no buffer zone, and that
this order did not succeed in protecting access to the clinic.
The failure of the first order to accomplish its purpose may
be taken into consideration in evaluating the constitutionality of the broader order. National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U. S. 679, 697-698 (1978). On
balance, we hold that the 36-foot buffer zone around the clinic
entrances and driveway burdens no more speech than necessary to accomplish the governmental interest at stake.

Justice Scalia's dissent argues that a videotape made
of demonstrations at the clinic represents "what one must
presume to be the worst of the activity justifying the injunction." Post, at 785-786. This seems to us a gratuitous assumption. The videotape was indeed introduced by respondents, presumably because they thought it supported
their request for the second injunction. But witnesses also
testified as to relevant facts in a 3-day evidentiary hearing,
and the state court was therefore not limited to Justice
Scalia's rendition of what he saw on the videotape to make
its findings in support of the second injunction. Indeed,
petitioners themselves studiously refrained from challenging
the factual basis for the injunction both in the state courts
and here. Before the Florida Supreme Court, petitioners
stated that "the Amended Permanent Injunction contains
fundamental error on its face. The sole question presented

Opinion of the Court
by this appeal is a question of law, and for purposes of this
appeal [petitioners] are assuming, arguendo, that a factual
basis exists to grant injunctive relief." Appellants' Motion
in Response to Appellees' Motion to Require Full Transcript
and Record of Proceedings in No. 93-00969 (Dist. Ct. App.
Fla.), p. 2. Petitioners argued against including the factual
record as an appendix in the Florida Supreme Court, and
never certified a full record. We must therefore judge this
case on the assumption that the evidence and testimony presented to the state court supported its findings that the presence of protesters standing, marching, and demonstrating
near the clinic's entrance interfered with ingress to and
egress from the clinic despite the issuance of the earlier
injunction.

2

The inclusion of private property on the back and side of
the clinic in the 36-foot buffer zone raises different concerns.
The accepted purpose of the buffer zone is to protect access
to the clinic and to facilitate the orderly flow of traffic on
Dixie Way. Patients and staff wishing to reach the clinic do
not have to cross the private property abutting the clinic
property on the north and west, and nothing in the record
indicates that petitioners' activities on the private property
have obstructed access to the clinic. Nor was evidence presented that protestors located on the private property
blocked vehicular traffic on Dixie Way. Absent evidence
that petitioners standing on the private property have obstructed access to the clinic, blocked vehicular traffic, or otherwise unlawfully interfered with the clinic's operation, this
portion of the buffer zone fails to serve the significant government interests relied on by the Florida Supreme Court.
We hold that on the record before us the 36-foot buffer zone
as applied to the private property to the north and west of
the clinic burdens more speech than necessary to protect
access to the clinic.

Opinion of the Court

B
In response to high noise levels outside the clinic, the statecourt restrained the petitioners from "singing, chanting,

whistling, shouting, yelling, use of bullhorns, auto horns,sound amplification equipment or other sounds or images observable to or within earshot of the patients inside the[c]linic" during the hours of 7:30 a.m. through noon on Mondays through Saturdays. We must, of course, take accountof the place to which the regulations apply in determining
whether these restrictions burden more speech than neces-sary. We have upheld similar noise restrictions in the past,
and as we noted in upholding a local noise ordinance aroundpublic schools, "the nature of a place, `the pattern of its normal activities, dictate the kinds of regulations . . . that arereasonable.' "

Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104,116 (1972). Noise control is particularly important around

hospitals and medical facilities during surgery and recoveryperiods, and in evaluating another injunction involving a
medical facility, we stated:

" `Hospitals, after all, are not factories or mines or as-sembly plants. They are hospitals, where human ailments are treated, where patients and relatives alikeoften are under emotional strain and worry, where
pleasing and comforting patients are principal facets ofthe day's activity, and where the patient and his family
. . . need a restful, uncluttered, relaxing, and helpful at-mosphere.' " NLRB v. Baptist Hospital, Inc., 442 U. S.
773, 783-784, n. 12 (1979), quoting Beth Israel Hospitalv. NLRB, 437 U. S. 483, 509 (1978) (

Blackmun, J., con-curring in judgment).

We hold that the limited noise restrictions imposed by thestate court order burden no more speech than necessary to
ensure the health and well-being of the patients at the clinic.The First Amendment does not demand that patients at a
medical facility undertake Herculean efforts to escape the

Opinion of the Court
cacophony of political protests. "If overamplified loudspeak-ers assault the citizenry, government may turn them down."

Grayned, supra, at 116. That is what the state court didhere, and we hold that its action was proper.

C
The same, however, cannot be said for the "images observ-able" provision of the state court's order. Clearly, threats

to patients or their families, however communicated, are pro-scribable under the First Amendment. But rather than prohibiting the display of signs that could be interpreted asthreats or veiled threats, the state court issued a blanket ban
on all "images observable." This broad prohibition on all"images observable" burdens more speech than necessary to
achieve the purpose of limiting threats to clinic patients ortheir families. Similarly, if the blanket ban on "images observable" was intended to reduce the level of anxiety andhypertension suffered by the patients inside the clinic, it
would still fail. The only plausible reason a patient wouldbe bothered by "images observable" inside the clinic would
be if the patient found the expression contained in such im-ages disagreeable. But it is much easier for the clinic to pull
its curtains than for a patient to stop up her ears, and nomore is required to avoid seeing placards through the windows of the clinic. This provision of the injunction violatesthe First Amendment.

D
The state court ordered that petitioners refrain from phys-ically approaching any person seeking services of the clinic

"unless such person indicates a desire to communicate" inan area within 300 feet of the clinic. The state court was
attempting to prevent clinic patients and staff from being"stalked" or "shadowed" by the petitioners as they approached the clinic. See International Soc. for Krishna
Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U. S. 672, 684 (1992) ("[F]ace-to-face solicitation presents risks of duress that are an appro512us3$91H 12-28-97 17:25:11 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
priate target of regulation. The skillful, and unprincipled,solicitor can target the most vulnerable, including those accompanying children or those suffering physical impairmentand who cannot easily avoid the solicitation").

But it is difficult, indeed, to justify a prohibition on alluninvited approaches of persons seeking the services of the
clinic, regardless of how peaceful the contact may be, withoutburdening more speech than necessary to prevent intimidation and to ensure access to the clinic. Absent evidence thatthe protesters' speech is independently proscribable (

i. e.,"fighting words" or threats), or is so infused with violence as

to be indistinguishable from a threat of physical harm, see
Milk Wagon Drivers, 312 U. S., at 292-293, this provisioncannot stand. "As a general matter, we have indicated that

in public debate our own citizens must tolerate insulting, andeven outrageous, speech in order to provide adequate breathing space to the freedoms protected by the First Amend-ment." Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S., at 322 (internal quotation
marks omitted). The "consent" requirement alone invali-dates this provision; it burdens more speech than is necessary to prevent intimidation and to ensure access to theclinic.

E

The final substantive regulation challenged by petitioners
relates to a prohibition against picketing, demonstrating, orusing sound amplification equipment within 300 feet of the

residences of clinic staff. The prohibition also covers imped-ing access to streets that provide the sole access to streets
on which those residences are located. The same analysisapplies to the use of sound amplification equipment here as
that discussed above: the government may simply demandthat petitioners turn down the volume if the protests overwhelm the neighborhood. Grayned, 408 U. S., at 116.

6 We need not decide whether the "images observable" and "noapproach" provisions are content based.

775Cite as: 512 U. S. 753 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
As for the picketing, our prior decision upholding a lawbanning targeted residential picketing remarked on the

unique nature of the home, as " `the last citadel of the tired,the weary, and the sick.' " Frisby, 487 U. S., at 484. We
stated that " `[t]he State's interest in protecting the well-being, tranquility, and privacy of the home is certainly of the
highest order in a free and civilized society.' " Ibid.But the 300-foot zone around the residences in this case is
much larger than the zone provided for in the ordinancewhich we approved in

Frisby. The ordinance at issue theremade it " `unlawful for any person to engage in picketing before or about the residence or dwelling of any individual.' "
Id., at 477. The prohibition was limited to "focused picket-ing taking place solely in front of a particular residence."

Id., at 483. By contrast, the 300-foot zone would ban "[g]en-eral marching through residential neighborhoods, or even
walking a route in front of an entire block of houses." Ibid.The record before us does not contain sufficient justification
for this broad a ban on picketing; it appears that a limitationon the time, duration of picketing, and number of pickets
outside a smaller zone could have accomplished the desiredresult.

IV
Petitioners also challenge the state court's order as beingvague and overbroad. They object to the portion of the injunction making it applicable to those acting "in concert"with the named parties. But petitioners themselves are
named parties in the order, and they therefore lack standingto challenge a portion of the order applying to persons who
are not parties. Nor is that phrase subject, at the behest ofpetitioners, to a challenge for "overbreadth"; the phrase itself does not prohibit any conduct, but is simply directed atunnamed parties who might later be found to be acting "in
concert" with the named parties. As such, the case is gov-erned by our holding in

Regal Knitwear Co. v. NLRB, 324U. S. 9, 14 (1945). There a party subject to an injunction

Souter, J., concurring
argued that the order was invalid because of a provision thatit applied to "successors and assigns" of the enjoined party.

Noting that the party pressing the claim was not a successoror assign, we characterized the matter as "an abstract controversy over the use of these words." Id., at 15.Petitioners also contend that the "in concert" provision of
the injunction impermissibly limits their freedom of associa-tion guaranteed by the First Amendment. See,

e. g., Citi-zens Against Rent Control/Coalition For Fair Housing v.

Berkeley, 454 U. S. 290 (1981). But petitioners are not en-joined from associating with others or from joining with
them to express a particular viewpoint. The freedom of as-sociation protected by the First Amendment does not extend
to joining with others for the purpose of depriving third par-ties of their lawful rights.

V
In sum, we uphold the noise restrictions and the 36-footbuffer zone around the clinic entrances and driveway because

they burden no more speech than necessary to eliminate theunlawful conduct targeted by the state court's injunction.
We strike down as unconstitutional the 36-foot buffer zoneas applied to the private property to the north and west of
the clinic, the "images observable" provision, the 300-footno-approach zone around the clinic, and the 300-foot buffer
zone around the residences, because these provisions sweepmore broadly than necessary to accomplish the permissible
goals of the injunction. Accordingly, the judgment of theFlorida Supreme Court is

Affirmed in part and reversed in part.
Justice Souter, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion and write separately only to clar-ify two matters in the record. First, the trial judge made

reasonably clear that the issue of who was acting "in concert"with the named defendants was a matter to be taken up in

individual cases, and not to be decided on the basis of pro-testers' viewpoints. See Tr. 40, 43, 93, 115, 119-120 (Apr.

12, 1993, Hearing). Second, petitioners themselves acknowl-edge that the governmental interests in protection of public
safety and order, of the free flow of traffic, and of property
rights are reflected in Florida law. See Brief for Petitioners17, and n. 7 (citing,

e. g., Fla. Stat. $$ 870.041-870.047 (1991)

Justice Stevens, concurring in part and dissenting in
part.

The certiorari petition presented three questions, corresponding to petitioners' three major challenges to the trialcourt's injunction.

1 The Court correctly and unequivocally

rejects petitioners' argument that the injunction is a"content-based restriction on free speech,"

ante, at 762-764,
as well as their challenge to the injunction on the basis that
it applies to persons acting "in concert" with them, ante, at775-776. I therefore join Parts II and IV of the Court's

opinion, which properly dispose of the first and third questions presented. I part company with the Court, however,
on its treatment of the second question presented, including
its enunciation of the applicable standard of review.

1 "QUESTIONS PRESENTED FOR REVIEW
"1. Whether a state court injunction placing a thirty-six-foot buffer zone
around an abortion clinic which prohibits peaceful pro-life speech in a traditional public forum is an unconstitutional content-based restriction on
free speech and association.

"2. Whether a state court injunction creating a consent requirement
before speech is permitted within a three-hundred-foot buffer zone around
an abortion clinic and residential areas is a reasonable time, place, and
manner restriction or an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech.

"3. Whether a state court injunction prohibiting named demonstrators
and those acting `in concert' from expressing peaceful speech within several designated buffer zones violates the First Amendment's protection of
freedom of speech and association." Pet. for Cert. i.

Opinion of Stevens, J.

I
I agree with the Court that a different standard governsFirst Amendment challenges to generally applicable legislation than the standard that measures such challenges to judi-cial remedies for proven wrongdoing. See

ante, at 764-765.Unlike the Court, however, I believe that injunctive relief

should be judged by a more lenient standard than legislation.As the Court notes, legislation is imposed on an entire community, ibid., regardless of individual culpability. By con-trast, injunctions apply solely to an individual or a limited
group of individuals who, by engaging in illegal conduct,have been judicially deprived of some liberty--the normal
consequence of illegal activity.2 Given this distinction, astatute prohibiting demonstrations within 36 feet of an abortion clinic would probably violate the First Amendment, butan injunction directed at a limited group of persons who have
engaged in unlawful conduct in a similar zone might wellbe constitutional.

The standard governing injunctions has two obvious di-mensions. On the one hand, the injunction should be no
more burdensome than necessary to provide complete relief,Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 702 (1979). In a First
Amendment context, as in any other, the propriety of theremedy depends almost entirely on the character of the violation and the likelihood of its recurrence. For this reason,standards fashioned to determine the constitutionality of
statutes should not be used to evaluate injunctions.On the other hand, even when an injunction impinges on
constitutional rights, more than "a simple proscription

2 Contrary to Justice Scalia's assumption, see post, at 794, n. 1, the
deprivation of liberty caused by an injunction is not a form of punishment.
Moreover, there is nothing unusual about injunctive relief that includes
some restriction on speech as a remedy for prior misconduct. National
Soc. of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U. S. 679, 697-698
(1978).

Opinion of Stevens, J.
against the precise conduct previously pursued" may be re-quired; the remedy must include appropriate restraints on

"future activities both to avoid a recurrence of the violationand to eliminate its consequences." National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U. S. 679, 697-698(1978). Moreover, "[t]he judicial remedy for a proven violation of law will often include commands that the law doesnot impose on the community at large."

Teachers v. Hud-son, 475 U. S. 292, 309-310, n. 22 (1986). As such, repeated

violations may justify sanctions that might be invalid ifapplied to a first offender or if enacted by the legislature.
See United States v. Paradise, 480 U. S. 149 (1987).In this case, the trial judge heard three days of testimony
and found that petitioners not only had engaged in tortiousconduct, but also had repeatedly violated an earlier injunction. The injunction is thus twice removed from a legisla-tive proscription applicable to the general public and should
be judged by a standard that gives appropriate deference tothe judge's unique familiarity with the facts.

II
The second question presented by the certiorari petition
asks whether the "consent requirement before speech is permitted" within a 300-foot buffer zone around the clinic uncon-stitutionally infringes on free speech.

3 Petitioners contend

that these restrictions create a "no speech" zone in which
they cannot speak unless the listener indicates a positive

3 See n. 1, supra. This question also encompasses the separate but
related question whether the 300-foot buffer zone in residential areas is a
reasonable time, place, and manner restriction, but incorrectly refers to
that zone as containing a consent requirement. For the reasons stated in
Part III-E of the Court's opinion, which I join, I agree that the findings
do not justify such a broad ban on picketing. I also agree with the Court's
rejection of petitioners' prior restraint challenge to the 300-foot zones.
See ante, at 763, n. 2.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
interest in their speech. And, in Part III-D of its opinion,the Court seems to suggest that, even in a more narrowly

defined zone, such a consent requirement is constitutionallyimpermissible.

Ante, at 773-774. Petitioners' argument
and the Court's conclusion, however, are based on a misreading of || (5) of the injunction.4

That paragraph does not purport to prohibit speech; it prohibits a species of conduct. Specifically, it prohibits petitioners "from physically approaching any person seeking the
services of the Clinic unless such person indicates a desire to
communicate by approaching or by inquiring" of petitioners.
App. 59. The meaning of the term "physically approaching"
is explained by the detailed prohibition that applies when
the patient refuses to converse with, or accept delivery of
literature from, petitioners. Absent such consent, the petitioners "shall not accompany such person, encircle, surround,
harass, threaten or physically or verbally abuse those individuals who choose not to communicate with them." Ibid.
As long as petitioners do not physically approach patients in
this manner, they remain free not only to communicate with
the public but also to offer verbal or written advice on an
individual basis to the clinic's patients through their "sidewalk counseling."

4 The full text of || (5) reads as follows:
"At all times on all days, in an area within three-hundred (300) feet of
the Clinic, from physically approaching any person seeking the services of
the Clinic unless such person indicates a desire to communicate by approaching or by inquiring of the [petitioners]. In the event of such invitation, the [petitioners] may engage in communications consisting of conversation of a non-threatening nature and by the delivery of literature within
the three-hundred (300) foot area but in no event within the 36 foot buffer
zone. Should any individual decline such communication, otherwise
known as `sidewalk counseling', that person shall have the absolute right
to leave or walk away and the [petitioners] shall not accompany such person, encircle, surround, harass, threaten or physically or verbally abuse
those individuals who choose not to communicate with them." App. 59.

781Cite as: 512 U. S. 753 (1994)
Opinion of Stevens, J.
Petitioners' "counseling" of the clinic's patients is a form
of expression analogous to labor picketing. It is a mixture
of conduct and communication. "In the labor context, it is
the conduct element rather than the particular idea being
expressed that often provides the most persuasive deterrent
to third persons about to enter a business establishment."
NLRB v. Retail Store Employees, 447 U. S. 607, 619 (1980)
(Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in result).
As with picketing, the principal reason why handbills containing the same message are so much less effective than
"counseling" is that "the former depend entirely on the persuasive force of the idea." Ibid. Just as it protects picketing, the First Amendment protects the speaker's right to
offer "sidewalk counseling" to all passers-by. That protection, however, does not encompass attempts to abuse an unreceptive or captive audience, at least under the circumstances of this case. One may register a public protest by
placing a vulgar message on his jacket and, in so doing, expose unwilling viewers, Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15,
21-22 (1971). Nevertheless, that does not mean that he has
an unqualified constitutional right to follow and harass an
unwilling listener, especially one on her way to receive medical services. Cf. Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104,
116 (1972).

The "physically approaching" prohibition entered by the
trial court is no broader than the protection necessary to
provide relief for the violations it found. The trial judge
entered this portion of the injunction only after concluding
that the injunction was necessary to protect the clinic's patients and staff from "uninvited contacts, shadowing and
stalking" by petitioners. App. 56. The protection is especially appropriate for the clinic patients given that the trial
judge found that petitioners' prior conduct caused higher levels of "anxiety and hypertension" in the patients, increasing
the risks associated with the procedures that the patients

Opinion of Stevens, J.
seek.5 Whatever the proper limits on a court's power torestrict a speaker's ability to physically approach or follow

an unwilling listener, surely the First Amendment does notprevent a trial court from imposing such a restriction given
the unchallenged findings in this case.The Florida Supreme Court correctly concluded:

"While the First Amendment confers on each citizen apowerful right to express oneself, it gives the picketer
no boon to jeopardize the health, safety, and rights ofothers. No citizen has a right to insert a foot in the
hospital or clinic door and insist on being heard--whilepurposefully blocking the door to those in genuine need
of medical services. No picketer can force speech intothe captive ear of the unwilling and disabled."

Operation Rescue v. Women's Health Center, Inc., 626 So. 2d664, 675 (1993).

I thus conclude that, under the circumstances of this case,the prohibition against "physically approaching" in the 300-
foot zone around the clinic withstands petitioners' FirstAmendment challenge. I therefore dissent from Part III-D.

Because I have joined Parts I, II, III-E, and IV of theCourt's opinion and have dissented as to Part III-D after

concluding that the 300-foot zone around the clinic is a rea-sonable time, place, and manner restriction, no further discussion is necessary. See n. 1, supra. The Court, however,proceeds to address challenges to the injunction that, al5 Specifically, in its findings of fact, the trial court noted that:
"This physician also testified that he witnessed the demonstrators running
along side of and in front of patients' vehicles, pushing pamphlets in car
windows to persons who had not indicated any interest in such literature.
As a result of patients having to run such a gauntlet, the patients manifested a higher level of anxiety and hypertension causing those patients
to need a higher level of sedation to undergo the surgical procedures,
thereby increasing the risk associated with such procedures." Id., at 54.

though arguably raised by petitioners' briefs, are not prop-erly before the Court.

After correctly rejecting the content-based challenge tothe 36-foot buffer zone raised by the first question in the
certiorari petition, the Court nevertheless decides to modify
the portion of that zone that it believes does not protectingress to the clinic. Petitioners, however, presented only

a content-based challenge to the 36-foot zone; they did not
present a time, place, and manner challenge. See n. 1,
supra. They challenged only the 300-foot zones on this
ground. Ibid. The scope of the 36-foot zone is thus not
properly before us.6 Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki
Kaisha v. U. S. Phillips Corp., 510 U. S. 27 (1993) (per
curiam).7

6 Indeed, it is unclear whether these challenges were presented to the
Florida Supreme Court. In their appeal to that court, petitioners did not
even file the transcript of the evidentiary hearings, contending that the
"sole question presented by this appeal is a question of law." See Appellants' Motion in Response to Appellees' Motion to Require Full Transcript
and Record of Proceedings in No. 93-00969 (Dist. Ct. App. Fla.), p. 2.
Because petitioners argued that the entire decree was invalid as a matter
of law, without making any contention that particular provisions should
be modified, it appears there was no argument in that court about the size
or the shape of the buffer zones.

Even if the question were properly presented here, I fully agree with
the Florida Supreme Court's refusal to quibble over a few feet one way or
the other when the parties have not directed their arguments at a narrow
factual issue of this kind. Operation Rescue v. Women's Health Center,
Inc., 626 So. 2d 664, 673 (1993). Moreover, respect for the highest court
of the State strongly counsels against this sort of error correction in this
Court.

7 Even assuming that a time, place, and manner challenge to the 36-foot

zone is fairly included within the first question presented, petitioners' brief
challenges the entire 36-foot zone as overbroad and seeks to have it invalidated in its entirety. Nowhere in their briefs do they argue that the portion of the zone on the north and west sides of the clinic should be struck
down in the event the Court upholds the restrictions on the front and east.
As such, we do not have the benefit of respondents' arguments why those
portions, if considered severally from the other portions of the zone, should
be upheld. Moreover, the existence in the record of facts found by the

The same is true of the noise restrictions and the "imagesobservable" provision of || (4).

8 That paragraph does not

refer to the 36-foot or the 300-foot buffer zones, nor does itrelate to the constitutionality of the "in concert" provision.

As such, although I am inclined to agree with the Court'sresolution respecting the noise and images restrictions, I believe the Court should refrain from deciding their constitu-tionality because they are not challenged by the questions
on which certiorari was granted.

IV
For the reasons stated, I concur in Parts I, II, III-E, andIV of the Court's opinion, and respectfully dissent from the

remaining portions.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Kennedy and
Justice Thomas join, concurring in the judgment in partand dissenting in part.

The judgment in today's case has an appearance of mod-eration and Solomonic wisdom, upholding as it does some

trial court respecting petitioners' conduct--independent of petitioners' obstruction of ingress and egress--that support the entire 36-foot zone
makes the Court's micromanagement of the injunction particularly inappropriate. See, e. g., App. 53 ("The clinic has fences on its west and north
side, and persons would occasionally place a ladder on the outside of the
fence and position themselves at an elevation above the fence and attempt
to communicate by shouting at persons (staff and patients) entering the
clinic"); id., at 54 ("[T]he doctor was followed as he left the clinic by a
person associated with the [petitioners] who communicated his anger to
the doctor by pretending to shoot him from the adjoining vehicle"); id.,
at 54-55 (noting that "a physician similarly employed was killed by an
antiabortionist at a clinic in North Florida").

8 Paragraph (4) provides in full:

"During the hours of 7:30 a.m. through noon, on Mondays through Saturdays, during surgical procedures and recovery periods, from singing,
chanting, whistling, shouting, yelling, use of bullhorns, auto horns, sound
amplification equipment or other sounds or images observable to or within
earshot of the patients inside the Clinic." Id., at 59.

portions of the injunction while disallowing others. Thatappearance is deceptive. The entire injunction in this case

departs so far from the established course of our jurispru-dence that in any other context it would have been regarded
as a candidate for summary reversal.But the context here is abortion. A long time ago, in dissent from another abortion-related case, Justice O'Connor,joined by thenJustice Rehnquist, wrote:

"This Court's abortion decisions have already workeda major distortion in the Court's constitutional jurisprudence. Today's decision goes further, and makes itpainfully clear that no legal rule or doctrine is safe from
ad hoc nullification by this Court when an occasion forits application arises in a case involving state regulation
of abortion. The permissible scope of abortion regula-tion is not the only constitutional issue on which this
Court is divided, but--except when it comes to abor-tion--the Court has generally refused to let such disagreements, however longstanding or deeply felt, pre-vent it from evenhandedly applying uncontroversial
legal doctrines to cases that come before it." Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gyne-cologists, 476 U. S. 747, 814 (1986) (citations omitted).

Today the ad hoc nullification machine claims its latest,greatest, and most surprising victim: the First Amendment.

Because I believe that the judicial creation of a 36-footzone in which only a particular group, which had broken no
law, cannot exercise its rights of speech, assembly, and asso-ciation, and the judicial enactment of a noise prohibition, applicable to that group and that group alone, are profoundly atodds with our First Amendment precedents and traditions, I
dissent. I

The record of this case contains a videotape, with runningcaption of time and date, displaying what one must presume

to be the worst of the activity justifying the injunction issued by Judge McGregor and partially approved today by
this Court. The tape was shot by employees of, or volunteers at, the Aware Woman Clinic on three Saturdays in February and March 1993; the camera location, for the first and
third segments, appears to have been an upper floor of the
clinic. The tape was edited down (from approximately 6 to
8 hours of footage to 1/2 hour) by Ruth Arick, a management
consultant employed by the clinic and by the Feminist Majority Foundation. App. 527, 529, 533.

Anyone seriously interested in what this case was about
must view that tape. And anyone doing so who is familiar
with run-of-the-mine labor picketing, not to mention some
other social protests, will be aghast at what it shows we have
today permitted an individual judge to do. I will do my best
to describe it.

On Saturday, March 6, 1993, a group of antiabortion protesters is gathered in front of the clinic, arrayed from east
(camera-left) to west (camera-right) on the clinic side of Dixie
Way, a small, nonartery street. Men, women, and children
are also visible across the street, on the south side of Dixie
Way; some hold signs and appear to be protesters, others
may be just interested onlookers.

On the clinic side of the street, two groups confront each
other across the line marking the south border of the clinic
property--although they are so close together it is often impossible to tell them apart. On the clinic property (and with
their backs to the camera) are a line of clinic and abortionrights supporters, stretching the length of the property.
Opposite them, and on the public right-of-way between
the clinic property and Dixie Way itself, is a group of abortion opponents, some standing in place, others walking a
picket line in an elongated oval pattern running the length
of the property's south border. Melbourne police officers
are visible at various times walking about in front of the

clinic, and individuals can be seen crossing Dixie Way at
various times.

Clinic supporters are more or less steadily chanting the
following slogans: "Our right, our right, our right, to decide";
"Right to life is a lie, you don't care if women die." Then
abortion opponents can be heard to sing: "Jesus loves the
little children, all the children of the world, red and yellow,
black and white, they are precious in His sight, Jesus loves
the little children of the world." Clinic supporters respond
with: Q: "What do we want?" A: "Choice." Q: "When do
we want it?" A: "Now." ("Louder!") And that call and
response is repeated. Later in the tape, clinic supporters
chant "1-2-3-4, we won't take it anymore; 5-6-7-8, Separate
the Church and State." On placards held by picketers and
by stationary protesters on both sides of the line, the following slogans are visible: "Abortionists lie to women."
"Choose Life: Abortion Kills." "N.O.W. Violence." "The
God of Israel is Pro-life." "RU 486 Now." "She Is a Child,
Not a Choice." "Abortion Kills Children." "Keep Abortion
Legal." "Abortion: God Calls It Murder." Some abortion
opponents wear T-shirts bearing the phrase "Choose Life."

As the abortion opponents walk the picket line, they traverse portions of the public right-of-way that are crossed by
paved driveways, on each side of the clinic, connecting the
clinic's parking lot to the street. At one point an automobile
moves west on Dixie Way and slows to turn into the westernmost driveway. There is a 3-to-4-second delay as the
picketers, and then the clinic supporters, part to allow the
car to enter. The camera cuts to a shot of another, parked
car with a potato jammed onto the tailpipe. There is no
footage of any person putting the potato on to the tailpipe.

Later, at a point when the crowd appears to be larger and
the picketers more numerous, a red car is delayed approximately 10 seconds as the picketers (and clinic supporters)
move out of the driveway. Police are visible helping to clear

a path for the vehicle to enter. As the car waits, two per-sons appearing to bear leaflets approach, respectively, the

driver and front passenger doors. They appear to elicit noresponse from the car's occupants and the car passes safely
onto clinic property. Later, a blue minivan enters the driveway and is also subject to the same delay. Still later a jeep-type vehicle leaves the clinic property and slows down

slightly where the driveway crosses the public right-of-way.At no time is there any apparent effort to prevent entry or
exit, or even to delay it, except for the time needed for thepicketers to get out of the way. There is no sitting down,
packing en masse, linking of hands, or any other effort to
blockade the clinic property.

The persons standing but not walking the picket line include a woman with a child in a stroller and a man shouting the Book of Daniel's account of Meshach, Shadrach, and
Abednego. A woman on a stepladder holds up a sign in
the direction of the clinic; a clinic supporter counters with
a larger sign held up between the other and the clinic. A
brief shot reveals an older man in a baseball cap--head,
shoulders, and chest visible above the clinic fence--who appears to be reading silently from a small book. A man on
clinic property holds a boom box out in the direction of the
abortion opponents. As the crowd grows it appears at various points to have spilled over into the north-side, westbound lane of Dixie Way.

At one point, Randall Terry arrives and the press converge
upon him, apparently in Dixie Way itself. A sign is held
near his head reading "Randall Terry Sucks." Terry appears to be speaking to the press and at one point tears
pages from a notebook of some kind. Through all of this,
abortion opponents and abortion-rights supporters appear to
be inches from one another on each side of the south border
of the property. They exchange words, but at no time is
there any violence or even any discernible jostling or physical contact between these political opponents.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
The scene shifts to early afternoon of the same day. Mostof the press and most of the abortion opponents appear to

have departed. The camera focuses on a woman who facesthe clinic and, hands cupped over her mouth, shouts the following: "Be not deceived; God is not mocked. . . . Ed Windle,
God's judgment is on you, and if you don't repent, He willstrike you dead. The baby's blood flowed over your hands,

Ed Windle. . . . You will burn in hell, Ed Windle, if you don'trepent. There were arms and legs pulled off today. . . . An
innocent little child, a little boy, a little girl, is being de-stroyed right now." Cheering is audible from the clinic
grounds. A second person shouts "You are responsible for
the deaths of children. . . . You are a murderer. Shame on
you." From the clinic grounds someone shouts "Why don't
you go join the wacko in Waco?" The first woman says "You
are applauding the death of your children. We will be
everywhere. . . . There will be no peace and no rest for the
wicked. . . . I pray that you will give them dreams and nightmares, God."

The second segment of the videotape displays a group of
approximately 40 to 50 persons walking along the side of a
major highway. It is Saturday, March 13, 1993, at 9:56 a.m.
The demonstrators walk in an oval pattern, carrying no signs
or other visible indicators of their purpose. According to
Ruth Arick, this second portion was filmed in front of the
condominium where clinic owner Ed Windle lived.

A third segment begins. The date-time register indicates
that it is the morning of Saturday, February 20, 1993. A
teenage girl faces the clinic and exclaims: "Please don't let
them kill me, Mommy. Help me, Daddy, please." Clinic
supporters chant, "We won't go back." A second woman,
the one who spoke at greatest length in the first segment,
calls, "If you [inaudible], help her through it." Off camera,
a group sings "Roe, Roe, Roe v. Wade, we will never quit,
Freedom of choice is the law of the land, better get used to
it." The woman from the first segment appears to address

specific persons on clinic property: "Do you ever wonder
what your baby would have looked like? Do you wonder
how old it would have been? Because I did the same thing
. . . ." Then a police officer is visible writing someone a
citation. The videotape ends with a shot of an automobile
moving eastbound on Dixie Way. As it slows to a stop at
the intersection of U. S. 1, two leafletters approach the car
and then pull back as it passes on.

The videotape and the rest of the record, including the
trial court's findings, show that a great many forms of expression and conduct occurred in the vicinity of the clinic.
These include singing, chanting, praying, shouting, the playing of music both from the clinic and from handheld boom
boxes, speeches, peaceful picketing, communication of familiar political messages, handbilling, persuasive speech directed at opposing groups on the issue of abortion, efforts to
persuade individuals not to have abortions, personal testimony, interviews with the press, and media efforts to report
on the protest. What the videotape, the rest of the record,
and the trial court's findings do not contain is any suggestion
of violence near the clinic, nor do they establish any attempt
to prevent entry or exit.

A

Under this Court's jurisprudence, there is no question that
this public sidewalk area is a "public forum," where citizens
generally have a First Amendment right to speak. United
States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 177 (1983). The parties to this
case invited the Court to employ one or the other of the two
well-established standards applied to restrictions upon this
First Amendment right. Petitioners claimed the benefit of
so-called "strict scrutiny," the standard applied to contentbased restrictions: The restriction must be "necessary to
serve a compelling state interest and . . . narrowly drawn to
achieve that end." Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educa512us3$91k 12-28-97 17:25:11 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Scalia, J.
tors' Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 45 (1983). Respondents, on theother hand, contended for what has come to be known as

"intermediate scrutiny" (midway between the "strict scru-tiny" demanded for content-based regulation of speech and
the "rational basis" standard that is applied--under the
Equal Protection Clause--to government regulation of non-speech activities). See,

e. g., Turner Broadcasting System,
Inc. v. FCC, ante, at 642. That standard, applicable to so-called "time, place, and manner regulations" of speech, provides that the regulations are permissible so long as they"are content-neutral, are narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest, and leave open ample alternative channels of communication." Perry, supra, at 45. The
Court adopts neither of these, but creates, brand new for
this abortion-related case, an additional standard that is
(supposedly) "somewhat more stringent," ante, at 765, than
intermediate scrutiny, yet not as "rigorous," ibid., as strict
scrutiny. The Court does not give this new standard a
name, but perhaps we could call it intermediate-intermediate
scrutiny. The difference between it and intermediate scrutiny (which the Court acknowledges is inappropriate for injunctive restrictions on speech) is frankly too subtle for me
to describe, so I must simply recite it: Whereas intermediate
scrutiny requires that the restriction be "narrowly tailored
to serve a significant government interest," the new standard requires that the restriction "burden no more speech
than necessary to serve a significant government interest."
Ibid.

I shall discuss the Court's mode of applying this supposedly new standard presently, but first I must remark upon
the peculiar manner in which the standard was devised.
The Court begins, in Part II of the opinion, by considering
petitioners' contention that, since the restriction is content
based, strict scrutiny should govern. It rejects the premise,
and hence rejects the conclusion. It then proceeds, in Part
III, to examination of respondents' contention that plain old

512us3$91k 12-28-97 17:25:11 PAGES OPINPGT
792 MADSEN v. WOMEN'S HEALTH CENTER, INC.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
intermediate scrutiny should apply. It says no to that, too,because of the distinctive characteristics of injunctions that

it discusses, ante, at 764-765, and hence decides to supple-ment intermediate scrutiny with intermediate-intermediate
scrutiny. But this neatly staged progression overlooks an
obvious option. The real question in this case is notwhether intermediate scrutiny, which the Court assumes to

be some kind of default standard, should be supplementedbecause of the distinctive characteristics of injunctions; but
rather whether those distinctive characteristics are not, forreasons of both policy and precedent, fully as good a reason
as "content basis" for demanding strict scrutiny. That possibility is simply not considered. Instead, the Court begins
Part III with the following optical illusion: "If this were a
content-neutral, generally applicable statute, instead of an
injunctive order, its constitutionality would be assessed
under the [intermediate scrutiny] standard," ante, at 764--
and then proceeds to discuss whether petitioners can sustain
the burden of departing from that presumed disposition.

But this is not a statute, and it is an injunctive order. The
Court might just as logically (or illogically) have begun Part
III: "If this were a content-based injunction, rather than a
non-content-based injunction, its constitutionality would be
assessed under the strict scrutiny standard"--and have then
proceeded to discuss whether respondents can sustain the
burden of departing from that presumed disposition. The
question should be approached, it seems to me, without any
such artificial loading of the dice. And the central element
of the answer is that a restriction upon speech imposed by
injunction (whether nominally content based or nominally
content neutral) is at least as deserving of strict scrutiny as
a statutory, content-based restriction.

That is so for several reasons: The danger of content-based
statutory restrictions upon speech is that they may be designed and used precisely to suppress the ideas in question
rather than to achieve any other proper governmental aim.

512us3$91k 12-28-97 17:25:11 PAGES OPINPGT

793Cite as: 512 U. S. 753 (1994)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
But that same danger exists with injunctions. Although a
speech-restricting injunction may not attack content as content (in the present case, as I shall discuss, even that is not
true), it lends itself just as readily to the targeted suppression of particular ideas. When a judge, on the motion of an
employer, enjoins picketing at the site of a labor dispute,
he enjoins (and he knows he is enjoining) the expression of
pro-union views. Such targeting of one or the other side of
an ideological dispute cannot readily be achieved in speechrestricting general legislation except by making content the
basis of the restriction; it is achieved in speech-restricting
injunctions almost invariably. The proceedings before us
here illustrate well enough what I mean. The injunction
was sought against a single-issue advocacy group by persons
and organizations with a business or social interest in suppressing that group's point of view.

The second reason speech-restricting injunctions are at
least as deserving of strict scrutiny is obvious enough: They
are the product of individual judges rather than of legislatures--and often of judges who have been chagrined by prior
disobedience of their orders. The right to free speech
should not lightly be placed within the control of a single
man or woman. And the third reason is that the injunction
is a much more powerful weapon than a statute, and so
should be subjected to greater safeguards. Normally, when
injunctions are enforced through contempt proceedings, only
the defense of factual innocence is available. The collateral
bar rule of Walker v. Birmingham, 388 U. S. 307 (1967), eliminates the defense that the injunction itself was unconstitutional. Accord, Dade County Classroom Teachers' Assn. v.
Rubin, 238 So. 2d 284, 288 (Fla. 1970). Thus, persons subject to a speech-restricting injunction who have not the
money or not the time to lodge an immediate appeal face a
Hobson's choice: They must remain silent, since if they speak
their First Amendment rights are no defense in subsequent

794 MADSEN v. WOMEN'S HEALTH CENTER, INC.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
contempt proceedings. This is good reason to require the
strictest standard for issuance of such orders.1

The Court seeks to minimize the similarity between
speech-restricting injunctions and content-based statutory
proscriptions by observing that the fact that "petitioners all
share the same viewpoint regarding abortion does not in itself demonstrate that some invidious content- or viewpointbased purpose motivated the issuance of the order," but
rather "suggests only that those in the group whose conduct
violated the court's order happen to share the same opinion
regarding abortions," ante, at 763. But the Court errs in
thinking that the vice of content-based statutes is that they
necessarily have the invidious purpose of suppressing particular ideas. "[O]ur cases have consistently held that `[i]llicit
legislative intent is not the sine qua non of a violation of the
First Amendment.' " Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of
N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 117 (1991)
(quoting Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota
Comm'r of Revenue, 460 U. S. 575, 592 (1983)). The vice of
content-based legislation--what renders it deserving of the
high standard of strict scrutiny--is not that it is always used
for invidious, thought-control purposes, but that it lends itself to use for those purposes. And, because of the unavoid1 Justice Stevens believes that speech-restricting injunctions "should
be judged by a more lenient standard than legislation" because "injunctions apply solely to [those] who, by engaging in illegal conduct, have been
judicially deprived of some liberty." Ante, at 778. Punishing unlawful
action by judicial abridgment of First Amendment rights is an interesting
concept; perhaps Eighth Amendment rights could be next. I know of no
authority for the proposition that restriction of speech, rather than fines
or imprisonment, should be the sanction for misconduct. The supposed
prior violation of a judicial order was the only thing that rendered petitioners subject to a personally tailored restriction on speech in the first
place--not in order to punish them, but to protect the public order. To
say that their prior violation not only subjects them to being singled out
in this fashion, but also loosens the standards for protecting the public
order through speech restrictions, is double counting.

able "targeting" discussed above, precisely the same is trueof the speech-restricting injunction.

Finally, though I believe speech-restricting injunctions aredangerous enough to warrant strict scrutiny even when they
are not technically content based, I think the injunction inthe present case was content based (indeed, viewpoint based)
to boot. The Court claims that it was directed, not at thosewho

spoke certain things (antiabortion sentiments), but atthose who did certain things (violated the earlier injunction).

If that were true, then the injunction's residual coverage of"all persons acting in concert or participation with [the
named individuals and organizations], or on their behalf,"would not include those who merely entertained the same
beliefs and wished to express the same views as the nameddefendants. But the construction given to the injunction by
the issuing judge, which is entitled to great weight, cf. Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, 505 U. S. 123, 132-133(1992); NLRB v. Donnelly Garment Co., 330 U. S. 219, 227

(1947), is to the contrary: All those who wish to express thesame views as the named defendants are deemed to be "acting in concert or participation." Following issuance of theamended injunction, a number of persons were arrested for
walking within the 36-foot speech-free zone. At an April 12,1993, hearing before the trial judge who issued the injunction, the following exchanges occurred:

Mr. Lacy: "I was wondering how we can--why we werearrested and confined as being in concert with these people that we don't know, when other people weren't, thatwere in that same buffer zone, and it was kind of selective as to who was picked and who was arrested andwho was obtained for the same buffer zone in the same
public injunction."
The Court: "Mr. Lacy, I understand that those on theother side of the issue [abortion-rights supporters] were

also in the area. If you are referring to them, the In-junction did not pertain to those on the other side of the

issue, because the word in concert with means in con-cert with those who had taken a certain position in respect to the clinic, adverse to the clinic. If you are say-ing that is the selective basis that the pro-choice were
not arrested when pro-life was arrested, that's the basis
of that selection. . . ." Tr. 104-105 (Appearance Hear-ings Held Before Judge McGregor, Eighteenth Judicial

Circuit, Seminole County, Florida (emphasis added)).
And:

John Doe No. 16: "This was the first time that I was inthis area myself and I had not attempted to block an

entrance to a clinic in that town or anywhere else in theState of Florida in the last year or ever.

"I also understand that the reason why I was arrestedwas because I acted in concert with those who were
demonstrating pro-life. I guess the question that I'masking is were the beliefs in ideologies of the people that
were present, were those taken into consideration whenwe were arrested?

". . . When you issued the Injunction did you determine that it would only apply to--that it would apply

I have discussed, in the prior subsection, the policy rea-sons for giving speech-restricting injunctions, even contentneutral ones, strict scrutiny. There are reasons of prece-dent as well, which are essentially ignored by the Court.

To begin with, an injunction against speech is the veryprototype of the greatest threat to First Amendment values,
the prior restraint. As The Chief Justice wrote for theCourt last Term: "The term prior restraint is used `to describe administrative and judicial orders forbidding certaincommunications when issued in advance of the time that such
communications are to occur.' . . . [P]ermanent injunctions,i. e.,--court orders that actually forbid speech activities--are
classic examples of prior restraints." Alexander v. UnitedStates, 509 U. S. 544, 550 (1993) (quoting M. Nimmer, Nimmer on Freedom of Speech $ 4.03, p. 4-14 (1984) (emphasisadded in Alexander)).

2 Justice Souter seeks to contradict this, saying that "the trial judge
made reasonably clear that the issue of who was acting `in concert' with
the named defendants was . . . not to be decided on the basis of protesters'
viewpoints. See Tr. 40, 43, 93, 115, 119-120 (Apr. 12, 1993, Hearing)."
Ante, at 776-777. The only way to respond to this scattershot assertion
is to refer the reader to the cited pages, plus one more (page 116) which
clarifies what might have been ambiguous on page 115. These pages are
reproduced verbatim in the Appendix to this opinion. As the reader will
observe, they do not remotely support Justice Souter's assertion that
the injunction does not distinguish on the basis of viewpoint.

3 This statement should be compared with today's opinion, which says,

ante, at 763, n. 2, that injunctions are not prior restraints (or at least not
the nasty kind) if they only restrain speech in a certain area, or if the

a `heavy presumption' against its constitutional validity,"

Princess Anne, 393 U. S. 175, 181 (1968)), and have repeat-edly struck down speech-restricting injunctions. See, e. g.,
Youngdahl v. Rainfair, Inc., 355 U. S. 131 (1957); Keefe,supra; New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U. S. 713

broadcast).At oral argument neither respondents nor the Solicitor
General, appearing as amicus for respondents, could identifya single speech-injunction case applying mere intermediate
scrutiny (which differs little if at all from the Court'sintermediate-intermediate scrutiny). We have, in our
speech-injunction cases, affirmed both requirements thatcharacterize strict scrutiny: compelling public need and surgical precision of restraint. Even when (unlike in the pres-ent case) the First Amendment activity is intermixed with
violent conduct, " `precision of regulation' is demanded."

distinction has no antecedent in our cases.

bombings, destruction of trucks, beatings of drivers, arson,and armed violence. We noted that the "picketing . . . was

set in a background of violence," id., at 294, which was "nei-ther episodic nor isolated,"

id., at 295, and we allowed the
ban on picketing "to prevent future coercion," id., at 296, as
part of a state court's power "to deal with coercion due toextensive violence,"

id., at 299. We expressly distinguished
the case from those in which there was no "[e]ntanglementwith violence."

Id., at 297. In Youngdahl v. Rainfair, Inc.,
supra, we refused to allow a blanket ban on picketing when,even though there had been scattered violence, it could not

be shown that "a pattern of violence was established which
would inevitably reappear in the event picketing were later
resumed." Id., at 139.

The utter lack of support for the Court's test in our jurisprudence is demonstrated by the two cases the opinion relies
upon. For the proposition that a speech restriction is valid
when it "burden[s] no more speech than necessary to accomplish a significant government interest," the Court cites
NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., supra, and Carroll v.
President and Comm'rs of Princess Anne, supra, at 184.
But as I shall demonstrate in some detail below, Claiborne
applied a much more stringent test; and the very text of
Carroll contradicts the Court. In the passage cited, Carroll
says this: "An order issued in the area of First Amendment
rights must be couched in the narrowest terms that will accomplish the pin-pointed objective permitted by constitutional mandate and the essential needs of the public order."
393 U. S., at 183. That, of course, is strict scrutiny; and it
does not remotely resemble the Court's new proposal, for
which it is cited as precedential support. "Significant government interest[s]" (referred to in the Court's test) are general, innumerable, and omnipresent--at least one of them
will be implicated by any activity set in a public forum.
"Essential needs of the public order," on the other hand, are
factors of exceptional application. And that an injunction

"burden no more than necessary" is not nearly as demandingas the requirement that it be couched in the "narrowest

terms that will accomplish [a] pin-pointed objective." Thatthe Court should cite this case as its principal authority is
an admission that what it announces rests upon no precedentat all.

I turn now from the Court's selection of a constitutionaltest to its actual application of that test to the facts of the

present case. Before doing that, however, it will be helpful--in order to demonstrate how far the Court has departedfrom past practice--to consider how we proceeded in a relatively recent case that did not involve the disfavored class ofabortion protesters.

NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co.,
458 U. S. 886 (1982), involved, like this case, protest demon-strations against private citizens mingling political speech

with (what I will assume for the time being existed here)
significant illegal behavior.4Writing for the Court,

Justice Stevens summarized theevents giving rise to the

Claiborne litigation (id., at 898-
906): A local chapter of the NAACP, rebuffed by public offi-cials of Port Gibson and Claiborne County in its request for

redress of various forms of racial discrimination, began a
boycott of local businesses. During the boycott, a youngblack man was shot and killed in an encounter with Port

Gibson police and "sporadic acts of violence ensued." Id., at902. The following day, boycott leader Charles Evers told a
group that boycott violators would be disciplined by theirown people and warned that the sheriff "could not sleep with
boycott violators at night." Ibid. He stated at a second

4 Claiborne Hardware involved both monetary damages and an injunction, but that is of no consequence for purposes of the point I am making
here: that we have been careful to insulate all elements of speech not
infected with illegality.

gathering that " `[i]f we catch any of you going in any of themracist stores, we're gonna break your damn neck.' " Ibid.

In connection with the boycott, there were marches and pick-eting (often by small children). "Store watchers" were
posted outside boycotted stores to identify those who traded,and their names were read aloud at meetings of the Claiborne County NAACP and published in a mimeographedpaper. The chancellor found that those persons were
branded traitors, called demeaning names, and socially ostra-cized. Some had shots fired at their houses, a brick was
thrown through a windshield, and a garden damaged. Otherevidence showed that persons refusing to observe the boycott were beaten, robbed, and publicly humiliated (byspanking).

The merchants brought suit against two groups involved inorganizing the boycott and numerous individuals. The trial
court found tort violations, violations of a state statute pro-hibiting secondary boycotts, and state antitrust violations.
It issued a broad permanent injunction against the boycott-ers, enjoining them from stationing "store watchers" at the
plaintiffs' business premises; from persuading any person towithhold patronage; from using demeaning and obscene language to or about any person because of his patronage; frompicketing or patrolling the premises of any of the respondents; and from using violence against any person or inflictingdamage upon any real or personal property.

Id., at 893.The Mississippi Supreme Court upheld the assessment of liability and the injunction, but solely on the tort theory, sayingthat " `[i]f any of these factors--force, violence, or threats--
is present, then the boycott is illegal regardless of whether itis primary, secondary, economical, political, social or other.' "
Id., at 895.The legal analysis of this Court proceeded along the
following lines:

"[T]he boycott . . . took many forms. [It] waslaunched at a meeting of the local branch of the NAACP.

802 MADSEN v. WOMEN'S HEALTH CENTER, INC.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
[It was] attended by several hundred persons. Its ac-knowledged purpose was to secure compliance . . . with

a lengthy list of demands for racial equality and racialjustice. The boycott was supported by speeches and
nonviolent picketing. Participants repeatedly encour-aged others to join its cause.

"Each of these elements of the boycott is a form ofspeech or conduct that is ordinarily entitled to protection under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. . . .`[T]he practice of persons sharing common views banding together to achieve a common end is deeply embed-ded in the American political process.' We recognize
that `by collective effort individuals can make theirviews known, when, individually, their voices would be
faint or lost.' " Id., at 907-908 (quoting CitizensAgainst Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing v.
Berkeley, 454 U. S. 290, 294 (1981)).
We went on to say that "[t]he right to associate does not loseall constitutional protection merely because some members

of the group may have participated in conduct or advocateddoctrine that itself is not protected," 458 U. S., at 908, and
held that the nonviolent elements of the protesters' activitieswere entitled to the protection of the First Amendment,

id.,at 915.

Because we recognized that the boycott involved elementsof protected First Amendment speech and other elements
not so protected, we took upon ourselves a highly particu-larized burden of review, recognizing a "special obligation
on this Court to examine critically the basis on which lia-bility was imposed."

Ibid. "The First Amendment," wenoted, "does not protect violence," but when conduct sanctionable by tort liability "occurs in the context of constitu-tionally protected activity . . . `precision of regulation' is demanded." Id., at 916 (quoting NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S.,at 438). Then, criticizing the Mississippi Supreme Court for
"broadly assert[ing]--without differentiation--that [i]ntimi512us3$91k 12-28-97 17:25:11 PAGES OPINPGT

dation, threats, social ostracism, vilification, and traductionwere devices used by the defendants to effectuate the boycott," 458 U. S., at 921 (internal quotation marks omitted),we carefully examined the record for factual support of the
findings of liability. While affirming that a "judgment tai-lored to the consequences of [individuals'] unlawful conduct
may be sustained," we said that "mere association with [a]group--absent a specific intent to further an unlawful aim
embraced by that group--is an insufficient predicate for lia-bility."

Id., at 925-926. We said in conclusion that anycharacterization of a political protest movement as a violent

conspiracy "must be supported by findings that adequatelydisclose the evidentiary basis for concluding that specific parties agreed to use unlawful means, that carefully identify theimpact of such unlawful conduct, and that recognize the importance of avoiding the imposition of punishment for consti-tutionally protected activity."

Id., at 933-934. Becausethis careful procedure had not been followed by the Mississippi courts, we set aside the entire judgment, including theinjunction.

Id., at 924, n. 67, 934.

I turn now to the Court's performance in the present case.I am content to evaluate it under the lax (intermediateintermediate scrutiny) standard that the Court has adopted,because even by that distorted light it is inadequate.

The first step under the Court's standard would be, oneshould think, to identify the "significant government interest" that justifies the portions of the injunction it upheld,namely, the enjoining of speech in the 36-foot zone, and the
making (during certain times) of " `sounds . . . within earshotof the patients inside the [c]linic.' " Ante, at 772. At one
point in its opinion, the Court identifies a number of govern-ment interests: the "interest in protecting a woman's freedom to seek lawful medical or counseling services," the "in-terest in ensuring the public safety and order, in promoting

the free flow of traffic on public streets and sidewalks, andin protecting the property rights of all its citizens," the "interest in . . . medical privacy," and the interest in "the psy-chological [and] physical well-being of the patient held `captive' by medical circumstance." Ante, at 767, 768. TheCourt says,

ante, at 768, that "these governmental interests[are] quite sufficient to justify an appropriately tailored injunction to protect them." Unless, however, the Court hasdestroyed even more First Amendment law than I fear, this
last statement must be read in conjunction with the Court'searlier acknowledgment that "[u]nder general equity principles, an injunction issues only if there is a showing that thedefendant has violated, or imminently will violate, some provision of statutory or common law, and that there is a `cogni-zable danger of recurrent violation.' "

Ante, at 765, n. 3(quoting United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629, 633

(1953)). It is too much to believe, even of today's opinion,that it approves issuance of an injunction against speech "to
promote the free flow of traffic" even when there has been
found no violation, or threatened violation, of a law relat-ing to that interest.

Assuming then that the "significant interests" the Courtmentioned must in fact be significant enough to be protected
by state law (a concept that includes a prior court order),which law has been, or is about to be, violated, the question
arises: What state law is involved here? The only one evenmentioned is the original September 30, 1992, injunction,

5

which had been issued (quite rightly, in my judgment) in re5 Justice Souter points out that "petitioners themselves acknowledge
that the governmental interests in protection of public safety and order,
of the free flow of traffic, and of property rights are reflected in Florida
law. See Brief for Petitioners 17, and n. 7 (citing [various Florida statutes])." Ante, at 777. This is true but quite irrelevant. As the preceding sentence of text shows, we are concerned here not with state laws in
general, but with state laws that these respondents had been found to
have violated. There is no finding of violation of any of these cited Florida statutes.

sponse to threats by the originally named parties (includingpetitioners here) that they would " `[p]hysically close down

abortion mills,' " "bloc[k] access to clinics," "ignore the law ofthe State," and "shut down a clinic." Permanent Injunction
Findings of Fact |||| 2, 5, 7, 8, App. 6-7. That original in-junction prohibited petitioners from:

"1) trespassing on, sitting in, blocking, impeding orobstructing ingress into or egress from any facility at
which abortions are performed in Brevard and SeminoleCounty Florida;

"2) physically abusing persons entering, leaving, work-ing or using any services of any facility at which abortions are performed in Brevard and Seminole County,Florida; and

"3) attempting or directing others to take any of theactions described in Paragraphs 1 and 2 above."

Id.,at 9.

According to the Court, the state court imposed the laterinjunction's "restrictions on petitioner[s'] . . . antiabortion
message because they repeatedly violated the court's origi-nal order."

Ante, at 763. Surprisingly, the Court acceptsthis reason as valid, without asking whether the court's findings of fact support it--whether, that is, the acts of whichpetitioners stood convicted were violations of the original
injunction.The Court simply takes this on faith--even though violation of the original injunction is an essential part of the rea-soning whereby it approves portions of the amended injunction, even though petitioners denied any violation of theoriginal injunction, even though the utter lack of proper
basis for the other challenged portions of the injunctionhardly inspires confidence that the lower courts knew what
they were doing, and even though close examination of thefactual basis for essential conclusions is the usual practice in
First Amendment cases, see Claiborne Hardware, 458 U. S.,

see also Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States,Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 517 (1984) (

Rehnquist, J., dissenting).Let us proceed, then, to the inquiry the Court neglected. In

the amended permanent injunction the trial court found that

"despite the injunction of September 30, 1992, there hasbeen interference with ingress to the petitioners' facility

. . . . [in] the form of persons on the paved portions ofDixie Way, some standing without any obvious relationship to others; some moving about, again without anyobvious relationship to others; some holding signs, some
not; some approaching, apparently trying to communi-cate with the occupants of motor vehicles moving on the
paved surface; some marching in a circular picket linethat traversed the entrance driveways to the two parking lots of the petitioners and the short section of side-walk joining the two parking lots and then entering the
paved portion of the north lane of Dixie Way and return-ing in the opposite direction. . . . Other persons would
be standing, kneeling and sitting on the unpaved shoul-ders of the public right-of-way. As vehicular traffic approached the area it would, in response to the conges-tion, slow down. If the destination of such traffic was
either of the two parking lots of the petitioners, suchtraffic slowed even more, sometimes having to momentarily hesitate or stop until persons in the drivewaymoved out of the way." Amended Permanent Injunction || A."As traffic slowed on Dixie Way and began its turn
into the clinic's driveway, the vehicle would be ap-proached by persons designated by the respondents as
sidewalk counselors attempting to get the attention ofthe vehicles' occupants to give them anti-abortion literature and to urge them not to use the clinic's services.Such so-called sidewalk counselors were assisted in ac512us3$91k 12-28-97 17:25:12 PAGES OPINPGT

complishing their approach to the vehicle by the hesita-tion or momentary stopping caused by the time needed

for the picket line to open up before the vehicle couldenter the parking lot." Id., || E.

"The . . . staff physician testified that on one occasionwhile he was attempting to enter the parking lot of the
clinic, he had to stop his vehicle and remained stoppedwhile respondent, Cadle, and others

took their time toget out of the way . . . . This physician also testified

that he witnessed the demonstrators running along sideof and in front of patients' vehicles, pushing pamphlets
in car windows to persons who had not indicated anyinterest in such literature. . . ."

Id., || I (emphasisadded).

On the basis of these findings Judge McGregor concludedthat "the actions of the respondents and those in concert
with them in the street and driveway approaches to the clinicof the plaintiffs continue to impede and obstruct both staff
and patients from entering the clinic. The paved surfacesof the public right-of-way must be kept open for the free flow
of traffic." Id., Conclusions, || A.6These are the only findings and conclusions of the court
that could conceivably be considered to relate to a violation
of the original injunction. They all concern behavior by the
protesters causing traffic on the street in front of the abor-tion clinic to slow down, and causing vehicles crossing the

6 In my subsequent discussion, I shall give the Florida trial court the
benefit of the doubt, and assume that the phrase "continue to impede and
obstruct" expresses the conclusion that petitioners had violated those provisions of the original injunction which prohibited "impeding or obstructing." It is not entirely clear, however, that the Florida court was in fact
asserting a violation of the original injunction. As far as the record
shows, it assessed no penalty for any such violation; and "impeding
and obstructing" can embrace many different things, not all of which (as
I shall discuss presently) come within the meaning of the original
injunction.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
pedestrian right-of-way, between the street and the clinic'sparking lot, to slow down or even, occasionally, to stop momentarily while pedestrians got out of the way. As far asappears from the court's findings, all of these results were
produced, not by anyone intentionally seeking to block oncoming traffic, but as the incidental effect of persons engagedin the activities of walking a picket line and leafletting on

public property in front of the clinic. There is no factualfinding that petitioners engaged in

any intentional or purposeful obstruction.Now let us compare these activities with the earlier injunction, violation of which is the asserted justification for
the speech-free zone. Walking the return leg of the picket
line on the paved portion of Dixie Way (instead of on the
sidewalk), and congregating on the unpaved portion of that
street, may, for all we know, violate some municipal ordinance (though that was not alleged, and the municipal police
evidently did not seek to prevent it); but it assuredly did not
violate the earlier injunction, which made no mention of such
a prohibition. Causing the traffic along Dixie Way to slow
down "in response to the congestion" is also irrelevant; the
injunction said nothing about slowing down traffic on public
rights-of-way. It prohibited the doing (or urging) of only
three things: (1) "physically abusing persons entering, leaving, working or using any services" of the abortion clinic
(there is no allegation of that); (2) "trespassing on [or] sitting
in" the abortion clinic (there is no allegation of that); and
(3) "blocking, impeding or obstructing ingress into or egress
from" the abortion clinic.

Only the last of these has any conceivable application here,
and it seems to me that it must reasonably be read to refer
to intentionally blocking, impeding, or obstructing, and not
to such temporary obstruction as may be the normal and
incidental consequence of other protest activity. That is obvious, first of all, from the context in which the original injunction was issued--as a response to petitioners' threatened

809Cite as: 512 U. S. 753 (1994)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
actions of trespass and blockade, i. e., the physical shuttingdown of the local clinics. Secondly, if that narrow meaning

of intentional blockade, impediment, or obstruction was notintended, and if it covered everything up to and including the
incidental and "momentary" stopping of entering vehicles by
persons leafletting and picketing, the original injunctionwould have failed the axiomatic requirement that its terms

be drawn with precision. See, e. g., Milk Wagon Drivers,312 U. S., at 296; 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies $ 2.8(7), p. 219
(2d ed. 1993); 7 J. Moore, J. Lucas, & K. Sinclair, Moore'sFederal Practice || 65.11 (2d ed. 1994); cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.
65(d) ("Every order granting an injunction . . . shall be specific in terms [and] shall describe in reasonable detail . . .
the act or acts sought to be restrained"). And finally, if the
original injunction did not have that narrow meaning it
would assuredly have been unconstitutional, since it would
have prevented speech-related activities that were, insofar
as this record shows, neither criminally or civilly unlawful
nor inextricably intertwined with unlawful conduct. See
Milk Wagon Drivers, supra, at 292, 297; Carroll, 393 U. S.,
at 183-184.

If the original injunction is read as it must be, there is
nothing in the trial court's findings to suggest that it was
violated. The Court today speaks of "the failure of the first
injunction to protect access." Ante, at 769. But the first injunction did not broadly "protect access." It forbade particular acts that impeded access, to wit, intentionally "blocking,
impeding or obstructing." The trial court's findings identify
none of these acts, but only a mild interference with access
that is the incidental by-product of leafletting and picketing.
There was no sitting down, no linking of arms, no packing
en masse in the driveway; the most that can be alleged (and
the trial court did not even make this a finding) is that on
one occasion protesters "took their time to get out of the
way." If that is enough to support this one-man proscription of free speech, the First Amendment is in grave peril.

810 MADSEN v. WOMEN'S HEALTH CENTER, INC.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
I almost forgot to address the facts showing prior violationof law (including judicial order) with respect to the other

portion of the injunction the Court upholds: the no-noise-within-earshot-of-patients provision. That is perhaps because, amazingly, neither the Florida courts nor this Court
makes the slightest attempt to link that provision to priorviolations of law. The relevant portion of the Court's opinion, Part II-B, simply reasons that hospital patients shouldnot have to be bothered with noise, from political protests or
anything else (which is certainly true), and that thereforethe noise restrictions could be imposed

by injunction (which
is certainly false). Since such a law is reasonable, in other
words, it can be enacted by a single man to bind only a single
class of social protesters. The pro-abortion demonstrators
who were often making (if respondents' videotape is accurate) more noise than the petitioners, can continue to shout
their chants at their opponents exiled across the street to
their hearts' content. The Court says that "[w]e have upheld similar noise restrictions in the past," ante, at 772, citing Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104 (1972). But
Grayned involved an ordinance, and not an injunction; it
applied to everyone. The only other authority the Court invokes is NLRB v. Baptist Hospital, Inc., 442 U. S. 773 (1979),
which it describes as "evaluating another injunction involving a medical facility," ante, at 772, but which evaluated no
such thing. Baptist Hospital, like Grayned, involved a restriction of general application, adopted by the hospital itself--and the case in any event dealt not with whether the
government had violated the First Amendment by restricting noise, but with whether the hospital had violated the
National Labor Relations Act by restricting solicitation (including solicitation of union membership).

Perhaps there is a local ordinance in Melbourne, Florida,
prohibiting loud noise in the vicinity of hospitals and abortion clinics. Or perhaps even a Florida common-law prohibition applies, rendering such noisemaking tortious. But the

record in this case shows (and, alas, the Court's opinion todaydemands) neither indication of the existence of any such law

nor a finding that it had been violated. The fact that sucha law would be reasonable is enough, according to the Court,
to justify a single judge in imposing it upon these protesters
alone. The First Amendment (and even the common law ofinjunctions, see the Court's own footnote 3) reels in disbelief.

The Court does not even attempt a response to the pointI have made in this section, insofar as the injunction against
noise is concerned. That portion of its opinion, ante, at 772-773, does not even allege any violation of the prior injunction
to support this judge-crafted abridgment of speech. Withrespect to the 36-foot speech-free zone, the Court attempts
a response, which displays either a misunderstanding of the
point I have made or an effort to recast it into an answerableone. My point does not rely, as the Court's response suggests, ante, at 770, upon my earlier description of the video-tape. That was set forth just for context, to show the
reader what suppression of normal and peaceful social pro-test is afoot here. Nor is it relevant to my point that "petitioners themselves studiously refrained from challenging thefactual basis for the injunction,"

ibid. I accept the facts as
the Florida court found them; I deny that those facts support
its conclusion (set forth as such in a separate portion of itsopinion, as quoted above) that the original injunction had

been violated. The Court concludes its response as follows:

"We must therefore judge this case on the assumption
that the evidence and testimony presented to the statecourt supported its findings that the presence of protesters standing, marching, and demonstrating near the clinic's entrance interfered with ingress to and egress from
the clinic despite the issuance of the earlier injunction."
Ante, at 771.

But a finding that they "interfered with ingress and egress
. . . despite the . . . earlier injunction" is not enough. The

Opinion of Scalia, J.
earlier injunction did not, and could not, prohibit all "inter-ference"--for example, the minor interference incidentally

produced by lawful picketing and leafletting. What theCourt needs, and cannot come up with, is a finding that the
petitioners interfered in a manner prohibited by the earlier
injunction. A conclusion that they "block[ed], imped[ed] orobstruct[ed] ingress . . . or egress" (the terminology of the

original injunction) within the only fair, and indeed the onlypermissible, meaning of that phrase cannot be supported by
the facts found.To sum up: The interests assertedly protected by the supplementary injunction did not include any interest whose im-pairment was a violation of Florida law or of a Florida court
injunction. Unless the Court intends today to overturnlong-settled jurisprudence, that means that the interests cannot possibly qualify as "significant interests" under theCourt's new standard.

C
Finally, I turn to the Court's application of the second partof its test: whether the provisions of the injunction "burden

no more speech than necessary" to serve the significant in-terest protected.

This test seems to me amply and obviously satisfied withregard to the noise restriction that the Court approves: It is
only such noise as would reach the patients in the abortionclinic that is forbidden--and not even at all times, but only
during certain fixed hours and "during surgical proceduresand recovery periods." (The latter limitation may raise
vagueness and notice problems, but that does not concern ushere. Moreover, as I have noted earlier, the noise restriction is invalid on other grounds.) With regard to the 36-footspeech-free zone, however, it seems to me just as obvious
that the test which the Court sets for itself has not been met.Assuming a "significant state interest" of the sort cognizable for injunction purposes (i. e., one protected by a law thathas been or is threatened to be violated) in both (1) keeping

Opinion of Scalia, J.
pedestrians off the paved portion of Dixie Way, and (2) enabling cars to cross the public sidewalk at the clinic's driveways without having to slow down or come to even a "momentary" stop, there are surely a number of ways to protect
those interests short of banishing the entire protest demonstration from the 36-foot zone. For starters, the Court could
have (for the first time) ordered the demonstrators to stay
out of the street (the original injunction did not remotely
require that). It could have limited the number of demonstrators permitted on the clinic side of Dixie Way. And it
could have forbidden the pickets to walk on the driveways.
The Court's only response to these options is that "[t]he state
court was convinced that [they would not work] in view of
the failure of the first injunction to protect access." Ante,
at 769. But must we accept that conclusion as valid--when
the original injunction contained no command (or at the very
least no clear command) that had been disobeyed, and contained nothing even related to staying out of the street? If
the "burden no more speech than necessary" requirement
can be avoided by merely opining that (for some reason) no
lesser restriction than this one will be obeyed, it is not much
of a requirement at all.

But I need not engage in such precise analysis, since the
Court itself admits that the requirement is not to be taken
seriously. "The need for a complete buffer zone," it says,
"may be debatable, but some deference must be given to the
state court's familiarity with the facts and the background of
the dispute between the parties even under our heightened
review." Ante, at 769-770 (emphasis added). In application, in other words, the "burden no more speech than is
necessary" test has become an "arguably burden no more
speech than is necessary" test. This renders the Court's
intermediate-intermediate scrutiny not only no more stringent than plain old intermediate scrutiny, but considerably
less stringent.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
Another disturbing part of the Court's analysis is its reli-ance upon the fact that "witnesses . . . conceded that the

buffer zone was narrow enough to place petitioners at a dis-tance of no greater than 10 to 12 feet from cars approaching
and leaving the clinic," and that "[p]rotesters standing acrossthe narrow street from the clinic can still be seen and heard
from the clinic parking lots." Ante, at 770. This consid-eration of whether the injunction leaves open effective, alternative channels of communication is classic, time-place-and-manner-regulation, "intermediate scrutiny" review,
see Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989).And in that context it is reasonable. But since in this case
a general regulation establishing time, place, and manner re-strictions for all citizens is not at issue, these petitioners
have a right, not merely to demonstrate and protest at somereasonably effective place, but to demonstrate and protest
where they want to and where all other Floridians can,namely, right there on the public sidewalk in front of the
clinic. "[O]ne is not to have the exercise of his liberty ofexpression in appropriate places abridged on the plea that it
may be exercised in some other place." Schneider v. State
(Town of Irvington), 308 U. S. 147, 163 (1939). "Whetherpetitioner might have used some other [forum] . . . is of no

consequence. . . . Even if [another] forum had been available,that fact alone would not justify an otherwise impermissible
prior restraint." Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad,420 U. S. 546, 556 (1975).

In his dissent in Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214(1944), the case in which this Court permitted the wartime

military internment of Japanese-Americans, Justice Jacksonwrote the following:

"A military order, however unconstitutional, is not aptto last longer than the military emergency. . . . But once

show that the Constitution sanctions such an order, theCourt for all time has validated the principle of racial

discrimination in criminal procedure and of transplant-ing American citizens. The principle then lies about
like a loaded weapon ready for the hand of any authoritythat can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent
need." Id., at 246.
What was true of a misguided military order is true of amisguided trial-court injunction. And the Court has left a

powerful loaded weapon lying about today.What we have decided seems to be, and will be reported
by the media as, an abortion case. But it will go down inthe lawbooks, it will be cited, as a free-speech injunction
case--and the damage its novel principles produce will beconsiderable. The proposition that injunctions against
speech are subject to a standard indistinguishable from (un-less perhaps more lenient in its application than) the "intermediate scrutiny" standard we have used for "time, place,and manner" legislative restrictions; the notion that injunctions against speech need not be closely tied to any violationof law, but may simply implement sound social policy; and
the practice of accepting trial-court conclusions permittinginjunctions without considering whether those conclusions
are supported by any findings of fact--these latest by-products of our abortion jurisprudence ought to give all
friends of liberty great concern.For these reasons, I dissent from that portion of the judgment upholding parts of the injunction.

INTERNATIONAL UNION, UNITED MINEWORKERS OF AMERICA,

et al.v. BAGWELL
et al.

certiorari to the supreme court of virginia
No. 92-1625. Argued November 29, 1993--Decided June 30, 1994
A month after enjoining petitioners (collectively, the union) from conducting unlawful strike-related activities against certain mining companies,
a Virginia trial court held a contempt hearing, fined the union for its
disobedience, and announced that the union would be fined for any future breach of the injunction. In subsequent contempt hearings, the
court levied against the union over $64 million in what it termed coercive, civil fines, ordering most of the money to be paid to the Commonwealth and the counties affected by the unlawful activities. After the
strike was settled, the court refused to vacate the fines owed to the
Commonwealth and counties, concluding that they were payable in effect to the public. Ultimately, it appointed respondent Bagwell to act
as Special Commissioner to collect the unpaid fines. The Virginia
Court of Appeals reversed and ordered that the fines be vacated. The
Virginia Supreme Court, reversing in its turn, rejected petitioners' contention that the fines were criminal and could not be imposed absent a
criminal trial.

Held: The serious contempt fines imposed here were criminal and constitutionally could be imposed only through a jury trial. Pp. 826-839.

(a) A criminal contempt fine is punitive and can be imposed only
through criminal proceedings, including the right to jury trial. A contempt fine is considered civil and remedial if it either coerces a defendant into compliance with a court order or compensates the complainant
for losses sustained. United States v. Mine Workers, 330 U. S. 258, 303-
304. Where a fine is not compensatory, it is civil only if the contemnor
has an opportunity to purge, such as with per diem fines and fixed,
suspended fines. Pp. 826-830.

(b) Most contempt sanctions share punitive and coercive characteristics, and the fundamental question underlying the distinction between
civil and criminal contempts is what process is due for the imposition of
any particular contempt sanction. Direct contempts can be penalized
summarily in light of the court's substantial interest in maintaining
order and because the need for extensive factfinding and the likelihood
of an erroneous deprivation are reduced. Greater procedural protections are afforded for sanctions of indirect contempts. Certain indirect

512us3$92z 12-28-97 17:27:47 PAGES OPINPGT
822 MINE WORKERS v. BAGWELL

Syllabus
contempts are particularly appropriate for imposition through civil proceedings, including contempts impeding the court's ability to adjudicate
the proceedings before it and those contempts involving discrete, readily
ascertainable acts. For contempts of more complex injunctions, however, criminal procedures may be required. Pp. 830-834.

(c) The mere fact that the contempt fines here were announced in
advance did not render them civil. Criminal laws generally provide
notice of the sanction to be imposed, and the union's ability to avoid the
contempt fines was indistinguishable from the ability of any citizen to
avoid a criminal sanction. Other considerations confirm that the fines
challenged here are criminal. Neither the parties nor the Commonwealth's courts have suggested that the fines are compensatory. The
union's sanctionable conduct did not occur in the court's presence or
otherwise implicate the core of the judicial contempt power, where
lesser protections may be appropriate. Nor did the union's contumacy
involve simple, affirmative acts, where the sanctions' force is primarily
coercive and elaborate factfinding is not required. Instead the court
levied fines for widespread, ongoing, out-of-court violations of a complex
injunction, effectively policing the union's compliance with an entire
code of conduct the court itself imposed. The contumacy lasted many
months and spanned several counties, and the fines assessed were serious. Under these circumstances, disinterested factfinding and evenhanded adjudication were essential, and the union was entitled to a
criminal jury trial. Pp. 834-838.

Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court.
We are called upon once again to consider the distinction
between civil and criminal contempt. Specifically, we address whether contempt fines levied against a union for vio-lations of a labor injunction are coercive civil fines, or are

criminal fines that constitutionally could be imposed onlythrough a jury trial. We conclude that the fines are criminal
and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the SupremeCourt of Virginia.

I
Petitioners, the International Union, United Mine Workers
of America, and United Mine Workers of America, District
28 (collectively, the union), engaged in a protracted labor dispute with the Clinchfield Coal Company and Sea "B" Mining
Company (collectively, the companies) over alleged unfair
labor practices. In April 1989, the companies filed suit in
the Circuit Court of Russell County, Virginia, to enjoin
the union from conducting unlawful strike-related activities. The trial court entered an injunction which, as later
amended, prohibited the union and its members from, among
other things, obstructing ingress and egress to company
facilities, throwing objects at and physically threatening
company employees, placing tire-damaging "jackrocks" on
roads used by company vehicles, and picketing with more
than a specified number of people at designated sites. The
court additionally ordered the union to take all steps necessary to ensure compliance with the injunction, to place su*Bertram R. Gelfand and Jeffrey C. Dannenberg filed a brief for the

Opinion of the Court
pervisors at picket sites, and to report all violations to thecourt. App. to Pet. for Cert. 114a-116a.

On May 18, 1989, the trial court held a contempt hearingand found that petitioners had committed 72 violations of the
injunction. After fining the union $642,000 for its disobedi-ence,

1 the court announced that it would fine the union

$100,000 for any future violent breach of the injunction and$20,000 for any future nonviolent infraction, "such as exceeding picket numbers, [or] blocking entrances or exits." Id.,at 111a. The court early stated that its purpose was to "impos[e] prospective civil fines[,] the payment of which wouldonly be required if it were shown the defendants disobeyed
the Court's orders." Id., at 40a.In seven subsequent contempt hearings held between June
and December 1989, the court found the union in contemptfor more than 400 separate violations of the injunction, many
of them violent. Based on the court's stated "intention thatthese fines are civil and coercive," id., at 104a, each contempt
hearing was conducted as a civil proceeding before the trialjudge, in which the parties conducted discovery, introduced
evidence, and called and cross-examined witnesses. Thetrial court required that contumacious acts be proved beyond
a reasonable doubt, but did not afford the union a right tojury trial.

As a result of these contempt proceedings, the court leviedover $64 million in fines against the union, approximately
$12 million of which was ordered payable to the companies.Because the union objected to payment of any fines to the
companies and in light of the law enforcement burdens posedby the strike, the court ordered that the remaining roughly
$52 million in fines be paid to the Commonwealth of Virginiaand Russell and Dickenson Counties, "the two counties most
heavily affected by the unlawful activity." Id., at 44a-45a.

1 A portion of these fines was suspended conditioned on the union's future compliance. The court later vacated these fines, concluding that they
were " `criminal in nature.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a, n. 2.

Opinion of the Court
While appeals from the contempt orders were pending, theunion and the companies settled the underlying labor dispute, agreed to vacate the contempt fines, and jointly movedto dismiss the case. A special mediator representing the
Secretary of Labor, App. 48-49, and the governments of
Russell and Dickenson Counties, id., at 48 and 54, supportedthe parties' motion to vacate the outstanding fines. The

trial court granted the motion to dismiss, dissolved the in-junction, and vacated the $12 million in fines payable to the
companies. After reiterating its belief that the remaining$52 million owed to the counties and the Commonwealth
were coercive, civil fines, the trial court refused to vacate
these fines, concluding they were "payable in effect to the
public." App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a.

The companies withdrew as parties in light of the settlement and declined to seek further enforcement of the outstanding contempt fines. Because the Commonwealth Attorneys of Russell and Dickenson Counties also had asked to
be disqualified from the case, the court appointed respondent
John L. Bagwell to act as Special Commissioner to collect
the unpaid contempt fines on behalf of the counties and the
Commonwealth. Id., at 48a.

The Court of Appeals of Virginia reversed and ordered
that the contempt fines be vacated pursuant to the settlement agreement. Assuming for the purposes of argument
that the fines were civil, the court concluded that "civil contempt fines imposed during or as a part of a civil proceeding
between private parties are settled when the underlying litigation is settled by the parties and the court is without discretion to refuse to vacate such fines." Mine Workers v.
Clinchfield Coal Co., 12 Va. App. 123, 133, 402 S. E. 2d 899,
905 (1991).

On consolidated appeals, the Supreme Court of Virginia
reversed. The court held that whether coercive, civil contempt sanctions could be settled by private parties was a
question of state law, and that Virginia public policy disfa512us3$92f 12-28-97 17:27:47 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
vored such a rule, "if the dignity of the law and public re-spect for the judiciary are to be maintained." 244 Va. 463,

478, 423 S. E. 2d 349, 358 (1992). The court also rejectedpetitioners' contention that the outstanding fines were criminal and could not be imposed absent a criminal trial. Be-cause the trial court's prospective fine schedule was intended
to coerce compliance with the injunction and the union couldavoid the fines through obedience, the court reasoned, the
fines were civil and coercive and properly imposed in civilproceedings:

"When a court orders a defendant to perform an affirm-ative act and provides that the defendant shall be fined
a fixed amount for each day he refuses to comply, thedefendant has control of his destiny. The same is true
with respect to the court's orders in the present case.A prospective fine schedule was established solely for
the purpose of coercing the Union to refrain from engag-ing in certain conduct. Consequently, the Union controlled its own fate." Id., at 477, 423 S. E. 2d, at 357.
This Court granted certiorari. 508 U. S. 949 (1993).

onment of more than six months, these protections include
the right to jury trial. Bloom, 391 U. S., at 199; see also
Taylor v. Hayes, 418 U. S. 488, 495 (1974). In contrast, civil
contempt sanctions, or those penalties designed to compel
future compliance with a court order, are considered to be
coercive and avoidable through obedience, and thus may be
imposed in an ordinary civil proceeding upon notice and an
opportunity to be heard. Neither a jury trial nor proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required.2

Although the procedural contours of the two forms of contempt are well established, the distinguishing characteristics
of civil versus criminal contempts are somewhat less clear.3
In the leading early case addressing this issue in the context
of imprisonment, Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., 221
U. S., at 441, the Court emphasized that whether a contempt
is civil or criminal turns on the "character and purpose" of
the sanction involved. Thus, a contempt sanction is considered civil if it "is remedial, and for the benefit of the com2 We address only the procedures required for adjudication of indirect
contempts, i. e., those occurring out of court. Direct contempts that occur
in the court's presence may be immediately adjudged and sanctioned summarily, see, e. g., Ex parte Terry, 128 U. S. 289 (1888), and, except for serious criminal contempts in which a jury trial is required, Bloom v. Illinois,
391 U. S. 194, 209-210 (1968), the traditional distinction between civil and
criminal contempt proceedings does not pertain, cf. United States v. Wilson, 421 U. S. 309, 316 (1975).

3 Numerous scholars have criticized as unworkable the traditional distinction between civil and criminal contempt. See, e. g., Dudley, Getting
Beyond the Civil/Criminal Distinction: A New Approach to the Regulation
of Indirect Contempts, 79 Va. L. Rev. 1025, 1033 (1993) (describing the
distinction between civil and criminal contempt as "conceptually unclear
and exceedingly difficult to apply"); Martineau, Contempt of Court: Eliminating the Confusion between Civil and Criminal Contempt, 50 U. Cin. L.
Rev. 677 (1981) ("Few legal concepts have bedeviled courts, judges, lawyers and legal commentators more than contempt of court"); Moskovitz,
Contempt of Injunctions, Civil and Criminal, 43 Colum. L. Rev. 780 (1943);
R. Goldfarb, The Contempt Power 58 (1963) (describing "the tangle of
procedure and practice" resulting from this "unsatisfactory fiction").

Opinion of the Court
plainant. But if it is for criminal contempt the sentence ispunitive, to vindicate the authority of the court."

Ibid.
As Gompers recognized, however, the stated purposes ofa contempt sanction alone cannot be determinative.

Id., at
443. "[W]hen a court imposes fines and punishments on a
contemnor, it is not only vindicating its legal authority toenter the initial court order, but it also is seeking to give

effect to the law's purpose of modifying the contemnor'sbehavior to conform to the terms required in the order."
Hicks, 485 U. S., at 635. Most contempt sanctions, like mostcriminal punishments, to some extent punish a prior offense
as well as coerce an offender's future obedience. The Hicks
Court accordingly held that conclusions about the civil or
criminal nature of a contempt sanction are properly drawn,
not from "the subjective intent of a State's laws and its
courts," ibid., but "from an examination of the character of
the relief itself," id., at 636.

The paradigmatic coercive, civil contempt sanction, as set
forth in Gompers, involves confining a contemnor indefinitely
until he complies with an affirmative command such as an
order "to pay alimony, or to surrender property ordered to
be turned over to a receiver, or to make a conveyance." 221
U. S., at 442; see also McCrone v. United States, 307 U. S. 61,
64 (1939) (failure to testify). Imprisonment for a fixed term
similarly is coercive when the contemnor is given the option
of earlier release if he complies. Shillitani v. United States,
384 U. S. 364, 370, n. 6 (1966) (upholding as civil "a determinate [2-year] sentence which includes a purge clause"). In
these circumstances, the contemnor is able to purge the contempt and obtain his release by committing an affirmative
act, and thus " `carries the keys of his prison in his own
pocket.' " Gompers, 221 U. S., at 442, quoting In re Nevitt,
117 F. 448, 451 (CA8 1902).

By contrast, a fixed sentence of imprisonment is punitive
and criminal if it is imposed retrospectively for a "completed
act of disobedience," Gompers, 221 U. S., at 443, such that

512us3$92f 12-28-97 17:27:47 PAGES OPINPGT

829Cite as: 512 U. S. 821 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
the contemnor cannot avoid or abbreviate the confinementthrough later compliance. Thus, the

Gompers Court concluded that a 12-month sentence imposed on Samuel Gom-pers for violating an antiboycott injunction was criminal.

When a contempt involves the prior conduct of an isolated,
prohibited act, the resulting sanction has no coercive effect."[T]he defendant is furnished no key, and he cannot shorten

the term by promising not to repeat the offense." Id., at442.

This dichotomy between coercive and punitive imprison-ment has been extended to the fine context. A contempt
fine accordingly is considered civil and remedial if it either
"coerce[s] the defendant into compliance with the court's
order, [or] . . . compensate[s] the complainant for losses sustained." United States v. Mine Workers, 330 U. S. 258, 303-
304 (1947). Where a fine is not compensatory, it is civil only
if the contemnor is afforded an opportunity to purge. See
Penfield Co. of Cal. v. SEC, 330 U. S. 585, 590 (1947). Thus,
a "flat, unconditional fine" totaling even as little as $50 announced after a finding of contempt is criminal if the contemnor has no subsequent opportunity to reduce or avoid the
fine through compliance. Id., at 588.

A close analogy to coercive imprisonment is a per diem
fine imposed for each day a contemnor fails to comply with
an affirmative court order. Like civil imprisonment, such
fines exert a constant coercive pressure, and once the jural
command is obeyed, the future, indefinite, daily fines are
purged. Less comfortable is the analogy between coercive
imprisonment and suspended, determinate fines. In this
Court's sole prior decision squarely addressing the judicial
power to impose coercive civil contempt fines, Mine Workers,
supra, it held that fixed fines also may be considered purgable and civil when imposed and suspended pending future
compliance. See also Penfield, 330 U. S., at 590 ("One who
is fined, unless by a day certain he [complies,] has it in his
power to avoid any penalty"); but see Hicks, 485 U. S., at 639,

Opinion of the Court
and n. 11 (suspended or probationary sentence is criminal).Mine Workers involved a $3,500,000 fine imposed against the

union for nationwide post-World War II strike activities.Finding that the determinate fine was both criminal and excessive, the Court reduced the sanction to a flat criminal fineof $700,000. The Court then imposed and suspended the remaining $2,800,000 as a coercive civil fine, conditioned on theunion's ability to purge the fine through full, timely compliance with the trial court's order.4 The Court concluded, inlight of this purge clause, that the civil fine operated as "a
coercive imposition upon the defendant union to compel obe-dience with the court's outstanding order." 330 U. S., at
307.This Court has not revisited the issue of coercive civil
contempt fines addressed in Mine Workers. Since thatdecision, the Court has erected substantial procedural protections in other areas of contempt law, such as criminalcontempts, e. g., Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 194 (1968), and
summary contempts, e. g., Taylor v. Hayes, 418 U. S. 488(1974); Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, 418 U. S. 506, 513 (1974);
Johnson v. Mississippi, 403 U. S. 212 (1971); In re Oliver,333 U. S. 257, 275 (1948). Lower federal courts and state
courts such as the trial court here nevertheless have reliedon

Mine Workers to authorize a relatively unlimited judicialpower to impose noncompensatory civil contempt fines.

Underlying the somewhat elusive distinction between civiland criminal contempt fines, and the ultimate question posed

4 Although the size of the fine was substantial, the conduct required of
the union to purge the suspended fine was relatively discrete. According
to the Court, purgation consisted of (1) withdrawal of the union's notice
terminating the Krug-Lewis labor agreement; (2) notifying the union
members of this withdrawal; and (3) withdrawing and notifying the union
members of the withdrawal of any other notice questioning the ongoing
effectiveness of the Krug-Lewis agreement. United States v. Mine Workers, 330 U. S. 258, 305 (1947).

Opinion of the Court
in this case, is what procedural protections are due before
any particular contempt penalty may be imposed. Because
civil contempt sanctions are viewed as nonpunitive and
avoidable, fewer procedural protections for such sanctions
have been required. To the extent that such contempts take
on a punitive character, however, and are not justified by
other considerations central to the contempt power, criminal
procedural protections may be in order.

The traditional justification for the relative breadth of the
contempt power has been necessity: Courts independently
must be vested with "power to impose silence, respect, and
decorum, in their presence, and submission to their lawful
mandates, and . . . to preserve themselves and their officers
from the approach and insults of pollution." Anderson v.
Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, 227 (1821). Courts thus have embraced an inherent contempt authority, see Gompers, 221
U. S., at 450; Ex parte Robinson, 19 Wall. 505, 510 (1874), as
a power "necessary to the exercise of all others," United
States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32, 34 (1812).

But the contempt power also uniquely is " `liable to
abuse.' " Bloom, 391 U. S., at 202, quoting Ex parte Terry,
128 U. S. 289, 313 (1888). Unlike most areas of law, where a
legislature defines both the sanctionable conduct and the
penalty to be imposed, civil contempt proceedings leave the
offended judge solely responsible for identifying, prosecuting, adjudicating, and sanctioning the contumacious conduct.
Contumacy "often strikes at the most vulnerable and human
qualities of a judge's temperament," Bloom, 391 U. S., at 202,
and its fusion of legislative, executive, and judicial powers
"summons forth . . . the prospect of `the most tyrannical licentiousness,' " Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils
S. A., 481 U. S. 787, 822 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment), quoting Anderson, 6 Wheat., at 228. Accordingly, "in
[criminal] contempt cases an even more compelling argument
can be made [than in ordinary criminal cases] for providing

512us3$92f 12-28-97 17:27:47 PAGES OPINPGT
832 MINE WORKERS v. BAGWELL

Opinion of the Court
a right to jury trial as a protection against the arbitraryexercise of official power."

Bloom, 391 U. S., at 202.
Our jurisprudence in the contempt area has attempted tobalance the competing concerns of necessity and potential

arbitrariness by allowing a relatively unencumbered contempt power when its exercise is most essential, and requir-ing progressively greater procedural protections when other

considerations come into play. The necessity justificationfor the contempt authority is at its pinnacle, of course, where
contumacious conduct threatens a court's immediate abilityto conduct its proceedings, such as where a witness refuses
to testify, or a party disrupts the court. See Young, 481
U. S., at 820-821 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (the
judicial contempt power is a "power of self-defense," limited
to sanctioning "those who interfere with the orderly conduct
of [court] business or disobey orders necessary to the conduct
of that business"). Thus, petty, direct contempts in the
presence of the court traditionally have been subject to summary adjudication, "to maintain order in the courtroom and
the integrity of the trial process in the face of an `actual
obstruction of justice.' " Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, 418
U. S., at 513, quoting In re McConnell, 370 U. S. 230, 236
(1962); cf. United States v. Wilson, 421 U. S. 309, 315-316
(1975); Harris v. United States, 382 U. S. 162, 164 (1965). In
light of the court's substantial interest in rapidly coercing
compliance and restoring order, and because the contempt's
occurrence before the court reduces the need for extensive
factfinding and the likelihood of an erroneous deprivation,
summary proceedings have been tolerated.

Summary adjudication becomes less justifiable once a
court leaves the realm of immediately sanctioned, petty direct contempts. If a court delays punishing a direct contempt until the completion of trial, for example, due process
requires that the contemnor's rights to notice and a hearing
be respected. Taylor v. Hayes, 418 U. S. 488 (1974). There
"it is much more difficult to argue that action without notice

Opinion of the Court
or hearing of any kind is necessary to preserve order andenable [the court] to proceed with its business,"

id., at 498,
particularly "in view of the heightened potential for abuseposed by the contempt power,"

id., at 500; see also Harris v.
United States, 382 U. S., at 164-165. Direct contempts also
cannot be punished with serious criminal penalties absentthe full protections of a criminal jury trial.

Bloom, 391
U. S., at 210.Still further procedural protections are afforded for contempts occurring out of court, where the considerations jus-tifying expedited procedures do not pertain. Summary adjudication of indirect contempts is prohibited, e. g., Cooke v.
United States, 267 U. S. 517, 534 (1925), and criminal contempt sanctions are entitled to full criminal process, e. g.,
Hicks, 485 U. S., at 632. Certain indirect contempts nevertheless are appropriate for imposition through civil proceedings. Contempts such as failure to comply with document
discovery, for example, while occurring outside the court's
presence, impede the court's ability to adjudicate the proceedings before it and thus touch upon the core justification
for the contempt power. Courts traditionally have broad
authority through means other than contempt--such as by
striking pleadings, assessing costs, excluding evidence, and
entering default judgment--to penalize a party's failure to
comply with the rules of conduct governing the litigation
process. See, e. g., Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 11, 37. Such judicial sanctions never have been considered criminal, and the
imposition of civil, coercive fines to police the litigation process appears consistent with this authority. Similarly, indirect contempts involving discrete, readily ascertainable acts,
such as turning over a key or payment of a judgment, properly may be adjudicated through civil proceedings since the
need for extensive, impartial factfinding is less pressing.

For a discrete category of indirect contempts, however,
civil procedural protections may be insufficient. Contempts
involving out-of-court disobedience to complex injunctions

834 MINE WORKERS v. BAGWELL

Opinion of the Court
often require elaborate and reliable factfinding. Cf. Greenv. United States, 356 U. S. 165, 217, n. 33 (1958) (Black,

J., dissenting) ("Alleged contempts committed beyond thecourt's presence where the judge has no personal knowledge
of the material facts are especially suited for trial by jury.A hearing must be held, witnesses must be called, and evidence taken in any event. And often . . . crucial facts arein close dispute" (citation omitted)). Such contempts do not
obstruct the court's ability to adjudicate the proceedings be-fore it, and the risk of erroneous deprivation from the lack
of a neutral factfinder may be substantial. Id., at 214-215.Under these circumstances, criminal procedural protections
such as the rights to counsel and proof beyond a reasonabledoubt are both necessary and appropriate to protect the due
process rights of parties and prevent the arbitrary exerciseof judicial power.

C
In the instant case, neither any party nor any court of theCommonwealth has suggested that the challenged fines are

compensatory. At no point did the trial court attempt tocalibrate the fines to damages caused by the union's contumacious activities or indicate that the fines were "to compen-sate the complainant for losses sustained."

Mine Workers,330 U. S., at 303-304. The nonparty governments, in turn,

never requested any compensation or presented any evi-dence regarding their injuries, never moved to intervene in
the suit, and never actively defended the fines imposed.The issue before us accordingly is limited to whether these
fines, despite their noncompensatory character, are coercivecivil or criminal sanctions.

The parties propose two independent tests for determin-ing whether the fines are civil or criminal. Petitioners
argue that because the injunction primarily prohibited cer-tain conduct rather than mandated affirmative acts, the sanctions are criminal. Respondents in turn urge that becausethe trial court established a prospective fine schedule that

512us3$92f 12-28-97 17:27:47 PAGES OPINPGT

835Cite as: 512 U. S. 821 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
the union could avoid through compliance, the fines are civilin character.

Neither theory satisfactorily identifies those contemptfines that are criminal and thus must be imposed through the
criminal process. Petitioners correctly note that Gompers
suggests a possible dichotomy "between refusing to do anact commanded,--remedied by imprisonment until the party

performs the required act; and doing an act forbidden,--pun-ished by imprisonment for a definite term." 221 U. S., at
443. The distinction between mandatory and prohibitoryorders is easily applied in the classic contempt scenario,
where contempt sanctions are used to enforce orders compelling or forbidding a single, discrete act. In such cases, orders commanding an affirmative act simply designate those
actions that are capable of being coerced.

But the distinction between coercion of affirmative acts
and punishment of prohibited conduct is difficult to apply
when conduct that can recur is involved, or when an injunction contains both mandatory and prohibitory provisions.
Moreover, in borderline cases injunctive provisions containing essentially the same command can be phrased either in
mandatory or prohibitory terms. Under a literal application
of petitioners' theory, an injunction ordering the union: "Do
not strike," would appear to be prohibitory and criminal,
while an injunction ordering the union: "Continue working,"
would be mandatory and civil. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 8-9;
Dobbs, Contempt of Court: A Survey, 56 Cornell L. Rev. 183,
239 (1971). In enforcing the present injunction, the trial
court imposed fines without regard to the mandatory or prohibitory nature of the clause violated. Accordingly, even
though a parsing of the injunction's various provisions might
support the classification of contempts such as rock throwing
and placing tire-damaging "jackrocks" on roads as criminal
and the refusal to place supervisors at picket sites as civil,
the parties have not asked us to review the order in that
manner. In a case like this involving an injunction that pre512us3$92f 12-28-97 17:27:47 PAGES OPINPGT
836 MINE WORKERS v. BAGWELL

Opinion of the Court
scribes a detailed code of conduct, it is more appropriate toidentify the character of the entire decree. Cf.

Hicks, 485
U. S., at 638, n. 10 (internal quotation marks omitted) (Whereboth civil and criminal relief is imposed "the criminal feature

of the order is dominant and fixes its character for purposes
of review").Despite respondents' urging, we also are not persuaded

that dispositive significance should be accorded to the factthat the trial court prospectively announced the sanctions it
would impose. Had the trial court simply levied the finesafter finding the union guilty of contempt, the resulting
"determinate and unconditional" fines would be considered
"solely and exclusively punitive." Id., at 632-633 (internal
quotation marks omitted); see also Penfield Co. of Cal. v.
SEC, 330 U. S. 585 (1947). Respondents nevertheless contend that the trial court's announcement of a prospective fine
schedule allowed the union to "avoid paying the fine[s] simply by performing the . . . act required by the court's order,"
Hicks, 485 U. S., at 632, and thus transformed these fines
into coercive, civil ones. Respondents maintain here, as the
Virginia Supreme Court held below, that the trial court could
have imposed a daily civil fine to coerce the union into compliance, and that a prospective fine schedule is indistinguishable from such a sanction.

Respondents' argument highlights the difficulties encountered in parsing coercive civil and criminal contempt fines.
The fines imposed here concededly are difficult to distinguish
either from determinate, punitive fines or from initially suspended, civil fines. Ultimately, however, the fact that the
trial court announced the fines before the contumacy, rather
than after the fact, does not in itself justify respondents' conclusion that the fines are civil or meaningfully distinguish
these penalties from the ordinary criminal law. Due process
traditionally requires that criminal laws provide prior notice
both of the conduct to be prohibited and of the sanction to
be imposed. The trial court here simply announced the pen512us3$92f 12-28-97 17:27:47 PAGES OPINPGT

837Cite as: 512 U. S. 821 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
alty--determinate fines of $20,000 or $100,000 per viola-tion--that would be imposed for future contempts. The

union's ability to avoid the contempt fines was indistinguish-able from the ability of any ordinary citizen to avoid a criminal sanction by conforming his behavior to the law. Thefines are not coercive day fines, or even suspended fines, but
are more closely analogous to fixed, determinate, retrospec-tive criminal fines which petitioners had no opportunity to
purge once imposed. We therefore decline to conclude thatthe mere fact that the sanctions were announced in advance
rendered them coercive and civil as a matter of constitu-tional law.

Other considerations convince us that the fines challengedhere are criminal. The union's sanctionable conduct did not
occur in the court's presence or otherwise implicate thecourt's ability to maintain order and adjudicate the proceedings before it. Nor did the union's contumacy involve sim-ple, affirmative acts, such as the paradigmatic civil contempts examined in Gompers. Instead, the Virginia trialcourt levied contempt fines for widespread, ongoing, out-ofcourt violations of a complex injunction. In so doing, thecourt effectively policed petitioners' compliance with an entire code of conduct that the court itself had imposed. Theunion's contumacy lasted many months and spanned a substantial portion of the State. The fines assessed were seri-ous, totaling over $52 million.

5 Under such circumstances,

5 "[P]etty contempt like other petty criminal offenses may be tried without a jury," Taylor v. Hayes, 418 U. S. 488, 495 (1974), and the imposition
only of serious criminal contempt fines triggers the right to jury trial.
Bloom, 391 U. S., at 210. The Court to date has not specified what magnitude of contempt fine may constitute a serious criminal sanction, although
it has held that a fine of $10,000 imposed on a union was insufficient to
trigger the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial. See Muniz v. Hoffman,
422 U. S. 454, 477 (1975); see also 18 U. S. C. $ 1(3) (1982 ed., Supp. V)
(defining petty offenses as crimes "the penalty for which . . . does not
exceed imprisonment for a period of six months or a fine of not more than
$5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a person other than an individual,

Opinion of the Court
disinterested factfinding and evenhanded adjudication wereessential, and petitioners were entitled to a criminal jury

trial.In reaching this conclusion, we recognize that this Court
generally has deferred to a legislature's determinationwhether a sanction is civil or criminal, see,

e. g., UnitedStates v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248 (1980); Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391 (1938), and that "[w]hen a State's proceed-ings are involved, state law provides strong guidance about
whether or not the State is exercising its authority `in a non-punitive, noncriminal manner.' " Hicks, 485 U. S., at 631,
quoting Allen v. Illinois, 478 U. S. 364, 368 (1986). We donot deviate from either tradition today. Where a single
judge, rather than a legislature, declares a particular sanc-tion to be civil or criminal, such deference is less appropriate.
Cf. Madsen v. Women's Health Center, Inc., ante, p. 753.Moreover, this Court has recognized that even for state proceedings, the label affixed to a contempt ultimately "will notbe allowed to defeat the applicable protections of federal constitutional law." Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U. S., at 631. We con-clude that the serious contempt fines imposed here were
criminal and constitutionally could not be imposed absent ajury trial.

III
Our decision concededly imposes some procedural burdenson courts' ability to sanction widespread, indirect contempts

of complex injunctions through noncompensatory fines. Ourholding, however, leaves unaltered the longstanding authority of judges to adjudicate direct contempts summarily, andto enter broad compensatory awards for all contempts
through civil proceedings. See, e. g., Sheet Metal Workersv. EEOC, 478 U. S. 421 (1986). Because the right to trial by

drawn, since a $52 million fine unquestionably is a serious contempt
sanction.

jury applies only to serious criminal sanctions, courts stillmay impose noncompensatory, petty fines for contempts such

as the present ones without conducting a jury trial. We alsodo not disturb a court's ability to levy, albeit through the
criminal contempt process, serious fines like those in this
case.Ultimately, whatever slight burden our holding may impose on the judicial contempt power cannot be controlling.The Court recognized more than a quarter century ago:

"We cannot say that the need to further respect for
judges and courts is entitled to more consideration than
the interest of the individual not be subjected to seriouscriminal punishment without the benefit of all the procedural protections worked out carefully over the yearsand deemed fundamental to our system of justice. Genuine respect, which alone can lend true dignity to ourjudicial establishment, will be engendered, not by the
fear of unlimited authority, but by the firm administration of the law through those institutionalized proce-dures which have been worked out over the centuries."

Bloom, 391 U. S., at 208.
Where, as here, "a serious contempt is at issue, considera-tions of efficiency must give way to the more fundamental

interest of ensuring the even-handed exercise of judicial
power." Id., at 209.The judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia is

reversed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion classifying the $52 million in con-tempt fines levied against petitioners as criminal. As the

Court's opinion demonstrates, our cases have employed a variety of not easily reconcilable tests for differentiating between civil and criminal contempts. Since all of those tests

Scalia, J., concurring
would yield the same result here, there is no need to decidewhich is the correct one--and a case so extreme on its facts

is not the best case in which to make that decision. I wishto suggest, however, that when we come to making it, a careful examination of historical practice will ultimately yieldthe answer.

That one and the same person should be able to make therule, to adjudicate its violation, and to assess its penalty is
out of accord with our usual notions of fairness and separa-tion of powers. See

ante, at 831; Green v. United States, 356U. S. 165, 198-199 (1958) (Black, J., dissenting); cf. Bloom v.

Illinois, 391 U. S. 194, 202 (1968); Cooke v. United States, 267U. S. 517, 539 (1925). And it is worse still for that person to
conduct the adjudication without affording the protectionsusually given in criminal trials. Only the clearest of historical practice could establish that such a departure from theprocedures that the Constitution normally requires is not a
denial of due process of law. See Burnham v. Superior
Court of Cal., County of Marin, 495 U. S. 604, 623-625(1990); cf.

Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg, ante, at 430-431.At common law, contempts were divided into criminal contempts, in which a litigant was punished for an affront tothe court by a fixed fine or period of incarceration; and civil
contempts, in which an uncooperative litigant was incarcer-ated (and, in later cases, fined*) until he complied with a
specific order of the court. See Gompers v. Bucks Stove &
Range Co., 221 U. S. 418, 441-444 (1911). Incarceration until
compliance was a distinctive sanction, and sheds light upon
the nature of the decrees enforced by civil contempt. Thatsanction makes sense only if the order requires performance

*The per diem fines that came to be used to coerce compliance with
decrees were in most relevant respects like conditional prison terms.
With them, as with incarceration, the penalty continued until the contemnor complied, and compliance stopped any further punishment but of
course did not eliminate or restore any punishment already endured.

of an identifiable act (or perhaps cessation of continuing performance of an identifiable act). A general prohibition for
the future does not lend itself to enforcement through conditional incarceration, since no single act (or the cessation of
no single act) can demonstrate compliance and justify release. One court has expressed the difference between
criminal and civil contempts as follows: "Punishment in criminal contempt cannot undo or remedy the thing which has
been done, but in civil contempt punishment remedies the
disobedience." In re Fox, 96 F. 2d 23, 25 (CA3 1938).

As one would expect from this, the orders that underlay
civil contempt fines or incarceration were usually mandatory
rather than prohibitory, see Gompers, supra, at 442, directing litigants to perform acts that would further the litigation
(for example, turning over a document), or give effect to the
court's judgment (for example, executing a deed of conveyance). The latter category of order was particularly common, since the jurisdiction of equity courts was generally in
personam rather than in rem, and the relief they decreed
would almost always be a directive to an individual to perform an act with regard to property at issue. See 4 J. Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence $ 1433, pp. 3386-3388 (4th ed.
1919). The mandatory injunctions issued upon termination
of litigation usually required "a single simple act." H. McClintock, Principles of Equity $ 15, pp. 32-33 (2d ed. 1948).
Indeed, there was a "historical prejudice of the court of
chancery against rendering decrees which called for more
than a single affirmative act." Id., $ 61, at 160. And where
specific performance of contracts was sought, it was the categorical rule that no decree would issue that required ongoing
supervision. See, e. g., Marble Co. v. Ripley, 10 Wall. 339,
358-359 (1870); see also McClintock, supra, $ 61, at 160-161;
1 J. Story, Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence $ 778b,
p. 782 (Redfield ed.; 10th ed. 1870). Compliance with these
"single act" mandates could, in addition to being simple, be

quick; and once it was achieved the contemnor's relationship
with the court came to an end, at least insofar as the subject
of the order was concerned. Once the document was turned
over or the land conveyed, the litigant's obligation to the
court, and the court's coercive power over the litigant,
ceased. See United States v. Mine Workers, 330 U. S. 258,
332 (1947) (Black, J., concurring in part and dissenting in
part). The court did not engage in any ongoing supervision
of the litigant's conduct, nor did its order continue to regulate his behavior.

Even equitable decrees that were prohibitory rather than
mandatory were, in earlier times, much less sweeping than
their modern counterparts. Prior to the labor injunctions
of the late 1800's, injunctions were issued primarily in relatively narrow disputes over property. See, e. g., W. Kerr,
Law and Practice of Injunctions *7 (2d Am. Ed. 1880); see
also F. Frankfurter & N. Greene, The Labor Injunction 23-
24, 87-88 (1930).

Contemporary courts have abandoned these earlier limitations upon the scope of their mandatory and injunctive decrees. See G. McDowell, Equity and the Constitution 4, 9
(1982). They routinely issue complex decrees which involve
them in extended disputes and place them in continuing
supervisory roles over parties and institutions. See, e. g.,
Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U. S. 33, 56-58 (1990); Swann
v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1, 16
(1971). Professor Chayes has described the extent of the
transformation:

"[The modern decree] differs in almost every relevant
characteristic from relief in the traditional model of adjudication, not the least in that it is the centerpiece. . . .
It provides for a complex, on-going regime of performance rather than a simple, one-shot, one-way transfer.
Finally, it prolongs and deepens, rather than terminates,
the court's involvement with the dispute." Chayes, The

Scalia, J., concurring
Role of the Judge in Public Law Litigation, 89 Harv. L.Rev. 1281, 1298 (1976).

The consequences of this change for the point underdiscussion here are obvious: When an order governs many
aspects of a litigant's activities, rather than just a discreteact, determining compliance becomes much more difficult.
Credibility issues arise, for which the factfinding protectionsof the criminal law (including jury trial) become much more
important. And when continuing prohibitions or obligationsare imposed, the order cannot be complied with (and the contempt "purged") in a single act; it continues to govern theparty's behavior, on pain of punishment--not unlike the
criminal law.The order at issue here provides a relatively tame example
of the modern, complex decree. The amended injunctionprohibited,

inter alia, rock throwing, the puncturing of tires,threatening, following or interfering with respondents' employees, placing pickets in other than specified locations, androving picketing; and it required,

inter alia, that petitionersprovide a list of names of designated supervisors. App. to

Pet. for Cert. 113a-116a. Although it would seem quite inaccord with historical practice to enforce, by conditional incarceration or per diem fines, compliance with the last provi-sion--a discrete command, observance of which is readily ascertained--using that same means to enforce the remainderof the order would be a novelty.

The use of a civil process for contempt sanctions "makesno sense except as a consequence of historical practice."

Weiss v. United States, 510 U. S. 163, 198 (1994) (Scalia, J.,concurring in part and concurring in judgment). As the
scope of injunctions has expanded, they have lost some ofthe distinctive features that made enforcement through civil
process acceptable. It is not that the times, or our percep-tions of fairness, have changed (that is in my view no basis

for either tightening or relaxing the traditional demands ofdue process); but rather that the modern judicial order is in

its relevant essentials not the same device that in formertimes could always be enforced by civil contempt. So adjustments will have to be made. We will have to decide atsome point which modern injunctions sufficiently resemble
their historical namesakes to warrant the same extraordi-nary means of enforcement. We need not draw that line in
the present case, and so I am content to join the opinion ofthe Court.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom The Chief Justicejoins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
The issue in this case is whether the contempt proceedingsbrought against the petitioner unions are to be classified as
"civil" or "criminal." As the Court explains, if those pro-ceedings were "criminal," then the unions were entitled
under our precedents to a jury trial, and the disputed fines,imposed in bench proceedings, could not stand. See

ante,at 826-827.

I
Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., 221 U. S. 418 (1911),as the Court notes, see

ante, at 827-828, is a pathmarkingcase in this area. The civil contempt sanction,

Gompers in-structs, is designed "to coerce the defendant to do the thing

required by the order for the benefit of the complainant,"rather than "to vindicate the authority of the law." 221
U. S., at 442. The sanction operates coercively because itapplies continuously until the defendant performs the discrete, "affirmative act" required by the court's order, forexample, production of a document or presentation of testimony. Ibid. The civil contemnor thus " `carries the keys ofhis prison in his own pocket' ": At any moment, "[h]e can end
the sentence and discharge himself . . . by doing what he hadpreviously refused to do."

Ibid., quoting In re Nevitt, 117F. 448, 461 (CA8 1902).

845Cite as: 512 U. S. 821 (1994)
Opinion of Ginsburg, J.
The criminal contempt sanction, by contrast, is "punitive,[imposed] to vindicate the authority of the court." Gompers, 221 U. S., at 441. Unlike the civil contemnor, who hasrefused to perform some discrete, affirmative act commanded
by the court, Gompers explains, the criminal contemnor has"do[ne] that which he has been commanded not to do."

Id.,at 442. The criminal contemnor's disobedience is past, a

"completed act," id., at 443, a deed no sanction can undo.See id., at 442. Accordingly, the criminal contempt sanction
operates not to coerce a future act from the defendant forthe benefit of the complainant, but to uphold the dignity of
the law, by punishing the contemnor's disobedience. Id., at442-443. Because the criminal contempt sanction is determinate and unconditional, the Court said in Gompers, "thedefendant is furnished no key, and he cannot shorten the
term by promising not to repeat the offense." Id., at 442.Even as it outlined these civil and criminal contempt prototypes, however, the Court in Gompers acknowledged thatthe categories, when filled by actual cases, are not altogether
neat and tidy. Civil contempt proceedings, although pri-marily remedial, also "vindicat[e] . . . the court's authority";
and criminal contempt proceedings, although designed "tovindicate the authority of the law," may bestow "some incidental benefit" upon the complainant, because "such punish-ment tends to prevent a repetition of the disobedience." Id.,
at 443. II

The classifications described in Gompers have come understrong criticism, particularly from scholars. Many have observed, as did the Court in Gompers itself, that the catego-ries, "civil" and "criminal" contempt, are unstable in theory
and problematic in practice. See ante, at 827, n. 3 (citingscholarly criticism); see also Dudley, Getting Beyond the
Civil/Criminal Distinction: A New Approach to the Regula-tion of Indirect Contempts, 79 Va. L. Rev. 1025, 1025, n. 1
(1993) (citing additional scholarly criticism).

512us3$92p 12-28-97 17:27:47 PAGES OPINPGT
846 MINE WORKERS v. BAGWELL

Opinion of Ginsburg, J.
Our cases, however, have consistently resorted to the distinction between criminal and civil contempt to determine
whether certain constitutional protections, required in criminal prosecutions, apply in contempt proceedings. See, e. g.,
United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 696 (1993) ("We have
held that [certain] constitutional protections for criminal
defendants . . . apply in nonsummary criminal contempt
prosecutions just as they do in other criminal prosecutions.")
(citing cases). And the Court has repeatedly relied upon
Gompers' delineation of the distinction between criminal
and civil contempt. See, e. g., Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U. S. 624,
631-633, 635-636 (1988). The parties, accordingly, have presented their arguments within the Gompers framework.

Two considerations persuade me that the contempt proceedings in this case should be classified as "criminal" rather
than "civil." First, were we to accept the logic of Bagwell's
argument that the fines here were civil, because "conditional" and "coercive," no fine would elude that categorization. The fines in this case were "conditional," Bagwell
says, because they would not have been imposed if the
unions had complied with the injunction. The fines would
have been "conditional" in this sense, however, even if the
court had not supplemented the injunction with its fines
schedule; indeed, any fine is "conditional" upon compliance
or noncompliance before its imposition. Cf. ante, at 837 (the
unions' ability to avoid imposition of the fines was "indistinguishable from the ability of any ordinary citizen to avoid a
criminal sanction by conforming his behavior to the law").
Furthermore, while the fines were "coercive," in the sense
that one of their purposes was to encourage union compliance
with the injunction, criminal contempt sanctions may also
"coerce" in this same sense, for they, too, "ten[d] to prevent a
repetition of the disobedience." Gompers, 221 U. S., at 443.
Bagwell's thesis that the fines were civil, because "condi512us3$92p 12-28-97 17:27:47 PAGES OPINPGT

847Cite as: 512 U. S. 821 (1994)
Opinion of Ginsburg, J.
tional" and "coercive," would so broaden the compass ofthose terms that their line-drawing function would be lost.*

Second, the Virginia courts' refusal to vacate the fines, de-spite the parties' settlement and joint motion, see ante, at
825-826, is characteristic of criminal, not civil, proceedings.In explaining why the fines outlived the underlying civil dispute, the Supreme Court of Virginia stated: "Courts of theCommonwealth must have the authority to enforce their orders by employing coercive, civil sanctions if the dignity ofthe law and public respect for the judiciary are to be maintained." 244 Va. 463, 478, 423 S. E. 2d 349, 358 (1992). TheVirginia court's references to upholding public authority and
maintaining "the dignity of the law" reflect the very pur-poses Gompers ranked on the criminal contempt side. See
supra, at 844-845. Moreover, with the private complainantgone from the scene, and an official appointed by the Commonwealth to collect the fines for the Commonwealth's cof-fers, it is implausible to invoke the justification of benefiting
the civil complainant. The Commonwealth here pursues thefines on its own account, not as the agent of a private party,
and without tying the exactions exclusively to a claim forcompensation. Cf.

Hicks, 485 U. S., at 632 ("[A] fine . . . [is]punitive when it is paid to the court," but "remedial" or

"civil" "when the defendant can avoid paying the fine simplyby performing the affirmative act required by the court's
order."). If, as the trial court declared, the proceedings

*Bagwell further likens the prospective fines schedule to the civil contempt fine imposed in United States v. Mine Workers, 330 U. S. 258 (1947).
In that case, however, the contemnor union was given an opportunity,
after the fine was imposed, to avoid the fine by "effect[ing] full compliance" with the injunction. As the Court explains, see ante, at 830, n. 4,
for purposes of allowing the union to avoid the fine, "full compliance" with
the broad no-strike injunction, see 330 U. S., at 266, n. 12, was reduced
to the performance of three affirmative acts. This opportunity to purge,
consistent with the civil contempt scenario described in Gompers, see
supra, at 844, was unavailable to the unions in this case.

were indeed civil from the outset, then the court should havegranted the parties' motions to vacate the fines.

No. 93-6497. Argued March 29, 1994--Decided June 30, 1994
Title 21 U. S. C. $ 848(q)(4)(B) entitles capital defendants to qualified legal

representation in any "post conviction proceeding" under 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254 or $ 2255, sections of the federal habeas corpus statute. Having
failed to obtain a modification of his impending execution date in Texas
state court, petitioner McFarland commenced this action in the Federal
District Court by filing a pro se motion stating that he wished to challenge his conviction and death sentence under $ 2254, requesting the
appointment of counsel under $ 848(q)(4)(B), and seeking a stay of execution to give that counsel time to prepare and file a habeas petition. The
court denied the motion, concluding that because no "post conviction
proceeding" had been initiated, McFarland was not entitled to counsel
and the court lacked jurisdiction to issue a stay. In denying his subsequent stay application, the Court of Appeals noted that $ 2251 authorizes
a federal judge, before whom a "habeas corpus proceeding is pending,"
to stay a state action, but held that no federal proceeding was pending
because a motion for stay and for appointed counsel was not the equivalent of a habeas petition.

Held: A capital defendant need not file a formal habeas corpus petition in

order to invoke his right to counsel under $ 848(q)(4)(B) and to establish
a federal court's jurisdiction to enter a stay of execution. Pp. 854-859.

(a) The language and purposes of $ 848(q)(4)(B) and its related provisions establish that the right to qualified appointed counsel adheres before the filing of a formal, legally sufficient habeas petition and includes
a right to legal assistance in the preparation of such a petition. Thus,
a "post conviction proceeding" within $ 848(q)(4)(B)'s meaning is commenced by the filing of a death row defendant's motion requesting the
appointment of counsel for his federal habeas proceeding. McFarland
filed such a motion and was entitled to the appointment of a lawyer.
Pp. 854-857.

(b) The District Court had jurisdiction to grant McFarland's motion
for stay of execution. The language of $$ 848(q)(4)(B) and 2251 indicates that "post conviction" and "habeas corpus" refer to the same proceeding. Thus, the two statutes must be read in pari materia to pro512us3$93Z 12-28-97 17:28:51 PAGES OPINPGT

vide that once a capital defendant invokes his right to appointed counsel
under $ 848(q)(4)(B), a proceeding is "pending" under $ 2251, such that
the federal court has jurisdiction to enter a stay in its sound discretion.
The Anti-Injunction Act does not bar the exercise of this authority, since

$ 2251 expressly authorizes a stay of state-court proceedings "for any
matter involved in the habeas corpus proceeding." Pp. 857-858.

Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court.
In establishing a federal death penalty for certain drugoffenses under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, 21 U. S. C.

$ 848(e), Congress created a statutory right to qualified legalrepresentation for capital defendants in federal habeas corpus proceedings. $ 848(q)(4)(B). This case presents thequestion whether a capital defendant must file a formal habeas corpus petition in order to invoke this statutory rightand to establish a federal court's jurisdiction to enter a stay
of execution. I

Petitioner Frank Basil McFarland was convicted of capitalmurder on November 13, 1989, in the State of Texas and
sentenced to death. The Texas Court of Criminal Appealsaffirmed the conviction and sentence, McFarland v. State,
845 S. W. 2d 824 (1992), and on June 7, 1993, this Courtdenied certiorari. 508 U. S. 963. Two months later, on August 16, 1993, the Texas trial court scheduled McFarland'sexecution for September 23, 1993. On September 19, McFarland filed a pro se motion requesting that the trial courtstay or withdraw his execution date to allow the Texas Resource Center an opportunity to recruit volunteer counsel forhis state habeas corpus proceeding. Texas opposed a stay
of execution, arguing that McFarland had not filed an appli-cation for writ of habeas corpus and that the court thus
lacked jurisdiction to enter a stay. The trial court declinedto appoint counsel, but modified McFarland's execution date
to October 27, 1993.

852 McFARLAND v. SCOTT

Opinion of the Court
On October 16, 1993, the Resource Center informed thetrial court that it had been unable to recruit volunteer counsel and asked the court to appoint counsel for McFarland.Concluding that Texas law did not authorize the appointment
of counsel for state habeas corpus proceedings, the trialcourt refused either to appoint counsel or to modify petitioner's execution date. McFarland then filed a pro se motionin the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals requesting a stay
and a remand for appointment of counsel. The court deniedthe motion without comment.

Having failed to obtain either the appointment of counsel
or a modification of his execution date in state court, McFarland, on October 22, 1993, commenced the present action inthe United States District Court for the Northern District

of Texas by filing a pro se motion stating that he "wish[ed]to challenge [his] conviction and sentence under [the federal habeas corpus statute,] 28 U. S. C. Sec. 2254." App. 42.McFarland requested the appointment of counsel under 21
U. S. C. $ 848(q)(4)(B) and a stay of execution to give thatcounsel time to prepare and file a habeas corpus petition.

1 Traditionally in Texas, capital defendants had invoked their federal
right to appointed counsel by filing a perfunctory habeas corpus petition,
often reciting a single claim. Texas customarily did not oppose a stay
following the filing of such a pro forma petition, and federal district courts
regularly granted a stay of execution under these circumstances and appointed counsel to file a legally sufficient habeas application. Tr. of Oral
Arg. 32-33.

In the month prior to McFarland's scheduled execution, however, a capital defendant facing imminent execution filed such a pro forma habeas
petition in District Court. Texas did not oppose the filing, but the District Court denied the stay and dismissed the skeletal petition on the merits. Gosch v. Collins, No. SA-93-CA-731 (WD Tex., Sept. 15, 1993). The
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, Gosch v. Collins, 8 F. 3d
20 (1993), cert. dism'd sub nom. Gosch v. Scott, post, p. 1216. Gosch then
filed a subsequent, substantive habeas petition, which the District Court
dismissed as successive and abusive. Gosch v. Collins, No. SA-93-CA-
736 (WD Tex., Oct. 12, 1993).

In a letter supporting McFarland's motion in the District Court, the
Resource Center indicated that the Gosch case had left capital defendants

Opinion of the Court
The District Court denied McFarland's motion on October25, 1993, concluding that because no "post conviction proceeding" had been initiated pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 or$ 2255, petitioner was not entitled to appointment of counsel
and the court lacked jurisdiction to enter a stay of execution.App. 77. The court later denied a certificate of probable
cause to appeal.On October 26, the eve of McFarland's scheduled execution, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied hisapplication for stay. 7 F. 3d 47. The court noted that federal law expressly authorizes federal courts to stay stateproceedings while a federal habeas corpus proceeding is
pending, 28 U. S. C. $ 2251, but held that no such proceedingwas pending, because a "motion for stay and for appointment
of counsel [is not] the equivalent of an application for habeasrelief." 7 F. 3d, at 49. The court concluded that any other
federal judicial interference in state-court proceedings wasbarred by the Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2283.

Shortly before the Court of Appeals ruled, a Federal Mag-istrate Judge located an attorney willing to accept appointment in McFarland's case and suggested that if the attorneywould file a skeletal document entitled "petition for writ of
habeas corpus," the District Court might be willing to ap-point him and grant McFarland a stay of execution. The
attorney accordingly drafted and filed a pro forma habeaspetition, together with a motion for stay of execution and
appointment of counsel. As in the Gosch case, see n. 1,supra, despite the fact that Texas did not oppose a stay, the
District Court found the petition to be insufficient and deniedthe motion for stay on the merits. McFarland v. Collins,
No. 4:93-CV-723-A (WD Tex., Oct. 26, 1993).On October 27, 1993, this Court granted a stay of execution in McFarland's original suit pending consideration of

reluctant to invoke their federal right to counsel by filing pro forma habeas petitions, given the substantial possibility that the petition might be
dismissed on the merits, and that any habeas petition later filed would be
dismissed summarily as an abuse of the writ. See App. 73-74.

Opinion of the Court
visions, however, indicates that the right to appointed coun-sel adheres prior to the filing of a formal, legally sufficient

habeas corpus petition. Section 848(q)(4)(B) expressly in-corporates 21 U. S. C. $ 848(q)(9), which entitles capital defendants to a variety of expert and investigative services
upon a showing of necessity:

"Upon a finding in ex parte proceedings that investi-gative, expert or other services are reasonably necessary for the representation of the defendant, . . . thecourt

shall authorize the defendant's attorneys to obtain
such services on behalf of the defendant and shall order
the payment of fees and expenses therefore" (emphasisadded).

The services of investigators and other experts may be critical in the preapplication phase of a habeas corpus proceeding, when possible claims and their factual bases are re-searched and identified. Section 848(q)(9) clearly anticipates

that capital defense counsel will have been appointed under$ 848(q)(4)(B) before the need for such technical assistance
arises, since the statute requires "the defendant's attorneys to obtain such services" from the court. $ 848(q)(9).
In adopting $ 848(q)(4)(B), Congress thus established a right
to preapplication legal assistance for capital defendants in
federal habeas corpus proceedings.

This interpretation is the only one that gives meaning to
the statute as a practical matter. Congress' provision of a
right to counsel under $ 848(q)(4)(B) reflects a determination
that quality legal representation is necessary in capital habeas corpus proceedings in light of "the seriousness of the
possible penalty and . . . the unique and complex nature of
the litigation." $ 848(q)(7). An attorney's assistance prior
to the filing of a capital defendant's habeas corpus petition is
crucial, because "[t]he complexity of our jurisprudence in this
area . . . makes it unlikely that capital defendants will be

the assistance of persons learned in the law." Murray v.
Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1, 14 (1989) (Kennedy, J., joined by
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); see also id., at 28
(Stevens, J., joined by Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun,
JJ., dissenting) ("[T]his Court's death penalty jurisprudence
unquestionably is difficult even for a trained lawyer to
master").

Habeas corpus petitions must meet heightened pleading
requirements, see 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 Rule 2(c), and comply
with this Court's doctrines of procedural default and waiver,
see Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991). Federal
courts are authorized to dismiss summarily any habeas petition that appears legally insufficient on its face, see 28
U. S. C. $ 2254 Rule 4, and to deny a stay of execution where
a habeas petition fails to raise a substantial federal claim,
see Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 894 (1983). Moreover,
should a defendant's pro se petition be summarily dismissed,
any petition subsequently filed by counsel could be subject
to dismissal as an abuse of the writ. See McCleskey v. Zant,
499 U. S. 467, 494 (1991). Requiring an indigent capital petitioner to proceed without counsel in order to obtain counsel
thus would expose him to the substantial risk that his habeas
claims never would be heard on the merits. Congress legislated against this legal backdrop in adopting $ 848(q)(4)(B),
and we safely assume that it did not intend for the express
requirement of counsel to be defeated in this manner.

The language and purposes of $ 848(q)(4)(B) and its related
provisions establish that the right to appointed counsel includes a right to legal assistance in the preparation of a habeas corpus application. We therefore conclude that a "post
conviction proceeding" within the meaning of $ 848(q)(4)(B)
is commenced by the filing of a death row defendant's motion
requesting the appointment of counsel for his federal habeas

B
Even if the District Court had granted McFarland's motionfor appointment of counsel and had found an attorney to represent him, this appointment would have been meaninglessunless McFarland's execution also was stayed. We therefore turn to the question whether the District Court hadjurisdiction to grant petitioner's motion for stay.

Federal courts cannot enjoin state-court proceedingsunless the intervention is authorized expressly by federal
statute or falls under one of two other exceptions to theAnti-Injunction Act. See

Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U. S. 225,226 (1972). The federal habeas corpus statute grants any

federal judge "before whom a habeas corpus proceeding is
pending" power to stay a state-court action "for any matterinvolved in the habeas corpus proceeding." 28 U. S. C.

$ 2251 (emphasis added). McFarland argues that his requestfor counsel in a "post conviction proceeding" under $ 848(q)
(4)(B) initiated a "habeas corpus proceeding" within themeaning of $ 2251, and that the District Court thus had jurisdiction to enter a stay. Texas contends, in turn, that evenif a "post conviction proceeding" under $ 848(q)(4)(B) can be

3 Justice Thomas argues in dissent that reading $ 848(q)(4)(B) to allow
the initiation of a habeas corpus proceeding through the filing of a motion
for appointment of counsel ignores the fact that such proceedings traditionally have been commenced by the filing of a habeas corpus petition
and creates a divergent practice for capital defendants. Post, at 872, n. 3.
As Justice O'Connor agrees, post, at 860, however, $ 848(q)(4)(B) bestows upon capital defendants a mandatory right to counsel, including a
right to preapplication legal assistance, that is unknown to other criminal
defendants. Because noncapital defendants have no equivalent right to
the appointment of counsel in federal habeas corpus proceedings, it is not
surprising that their habeas corpus proceedings typically will be initiated
by the filing of a habeas corpus petition.

Opinion of the Court
triggered by a death row defendant's request for appoint-ment of counsel, no "habeas corpus proceeding" is "pending"

under $ 2251, and thus no stay can be entered, until a legallysufficient habeas petition is filed.

The language of these two statutes indicates that the sections refer to the same proceeding. Section 848(q)(4)(B)expressly applies to "any post conviction proceeding under

section 2254 or 2255"--the precise "habeas corpus proceed-ing[s]" that $ 2251 involves. The terms "post conviction"
and "habeas corpus" also are used interchangeably in legalparlance to refer to proceedings under $$ 2254 and 2255. We
thus conclude that the two statutes must be read in pari
materia to provide that once a capital defendant invokes his
right to appointed counsel, a federal court also has jurisdiction under $ 2251 to enter a stay of execution. Because

$ 2251 expressly authorizes federal courts to stay state-court
proceedings "for any matter involved in the habeas corpus
proceeding," the exercise of this authority is not barred by
the Anti-Injunction Act.

This conclusion by no means grants capital defendants a
right to an automatic stay of execution. Section 2251 does
not mandate the entry of a stay, but dedicates the exercise
of stay jurisdiction to the sound discretion of a federal court.
Under ordinary circumstances, a capital defendant presumably will have sufficient time to request the appointment of
counsel and file a formal habeas petition prior to his scheduled execution. But the right to counsel necessarily includes a right for that counsel meaningfully to research and
present a defendant's habeas claims. Where this opportunity is not afforded, "[a]pproving the execution of a defendant before his [petition] is decided on the merits would
clearly be improper." Barefoot, 463 U. S., at 889. On the
other hand, if a dilatory capital defendant inexcusably ignores this opportunity and flouts the available processes, a
federal court presumably would not abuse its discretion in
denying a stay of execution.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.

III
A criminal trial is the "main event" at which a defendant's
rights are to be determined, and the Great Writ is an extraordinary remedy that should not be employed to "relitigate state trials." Id., at 887. At the same time, criminal
defendants are entitled by federal law to challenge their conviction and sentence in habeas corpus proceedings. By providing indigent capital defendants with a mandatory right
to qualified legal counsel in these proceedings, Congress has
recognized that federal habeas corpus has a particularly important role to play in promoting fundamental fairness in the
imposition of the death penalty.

We conclude that a capital defendant may invoke this right
to a counseled federal habeas corpus proceeding by filing a
motion requesting the appointment of habeas counsel, and
that a district court has jurisdiction to enter a stay of execution where necessary to give effect to that statutory right.
McFarland filed a motion for appointment of counsel and for
stay of execution in this case, and the District Court had
authority to grant the relief he sought.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor, concurring in the judgment in part
and dissenting in part.

I agree with the Court's conclusion that 21 U. S. C. $ 848
entitles capital defendants pursuing federal habeas corpus
relief to a properly trained attorney. I also agree that this
right includes legal assistance in preparing a habeas petition.
Thus, the Court correctly holds that a defendant need not
file a habeas petition to invoke the right to counsel. Ante,
at 856-857. I write separately, however, because I disagree
with the Court's conclusion that 28 U. S. C. $ 2251 allows a
district court to stay an execution pending counsel's prepara512us3$93j 12-28-97 17:28:51 PAGES OPINPGT

tion of an application for a writ of habeas corpus. Ante, at857-858.

As the Court explains, $ 848(q) must be read to apply priorto the filing of a habeas petition. It is almost meaningless
to provide a lawyer to pursue claims on federal habeas if the
lawyer is not available to help prepare the petition. First,the habeas petition, unlike a complaint, must allege the factual underpinning of the petitioner's claims. See HabeasCorpus Rule 2(c) ("The petition . . . shall specify all the
grounds for relief which are available to the petitioner . . .and shall set forth in summary form the facts supporting
each of the grounds thus specified"). Furthermore, district
courts are authorized to summarily dismiss petitions which
appear on their face to be meritless. See Habeas Corpus
Rule 4. And our carefully crafted doctrines of waiver and
abuse of the writ make it especially important that the first
petition adequately set forth all of a state prisoner's colorable grounds for relief. Indeed, Congress expressly recognized "the seriousness of the possible penalty and . . . the
unique and complex nature of the litigation." 21 U. S. C.

$ 848(q)(7). Moreover, the statute entitles capital defendants not only to qualified counsel, but also to "investigative,
expert or other services . . . reasonably necessary for the
representation of the defendant." $ 848(q)(9). For such
services to be meaningful in the habeas context, they also
must be available prior to the filing of a first habeas petition.
See ante, at 855.

In my view, however, petitioner is not entitled under present law to a stay of execution while counsel prepares a habeas petition. The habeas statute provides in relevant part
that "[a] justice or judge of the United States before whom
a habeas corpus proceeding is pending, may . . . stay any
proceeding against the person detained in any State court."
28 U. S. C. $ 2251. While this provision authorizes a stay in
the habeas context, it does not explicitly allow a stay prior
to the filing of a petition, and our cases have made it clear

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
that capital defendants must raise at least some colorable
federal claim before a stay of execution may be entered.

"[F]ederal habeas [is not] a means by which a defendant
is entitled to delay an execution indefinitely. The procedures adopted to facilitate the orderly consideration
and disposition of habeas petitions are not legal entitlements that a defendant has a right to pursue irrespective of the contribution these procedures make toward
uncovering constitutional error." Barefoot v. Estelle,
463 U. S. 880, 887-888 (1983).

See also Autry v. Estelle, 464 U. S. 1 (1983) (per curiam)
(no automatic stay in this Court for review of a first federal
habeas petition where petition lacks merit).

Petitioner has not filed anything describing the nature of
his claims, if any. As a consequence, the Court's approach,
which permits a stay of execution in the absence of any
showing of a constitutional claim, conflicts with the sound
principle underlying our precedents that federal habeas review exists only to review errors of constitutional dimension,
and that the habeas procedures may be invoked only when
necessary to resolve a constitutional claim. Barefoot,
supra, at 892-896; see Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 312
(1963).

Congress knows how to give courts the broad authority to
stay proceedings of the sort urged by petitioner. For example, Congress expressly provided this Court with authority
to grant stays pending the filing of a petition for a writ of
certiorari:

"In any case in which the final judgment or decree of
any court is subject to review by the Supreme Court on
writ of certiorari, the execution and enforcement of such
judgment or decree may be stayed for a reasonable time
to enable the party aggrieved to obtain a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court." 28 U. S. C. $ 2101(f).

862 McFARLAND v. SCOTT

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
The absence of such explicit authority in the habeas statuteis evidence that Congress did not intend federal courts to

enter stays of execution in the absence of some showing onthe merits.

Moreover, just as the counsel provisions of $ 848(q) are intended to apply before the submission of a petition, the textand structure of the federal habeas statute suggest that the

stay provision contained in $ 2251 is intended to apply onlyafter a petition has been filed. Although the statute does
not specifically identify when "a habeas corpus proceeding ispending,"

ibid., other provisions of the statute show that
there is no "pending" habeas corpus proceeding until an application for habeas corpus has been filed, which is the mechanism for "institut[ing]" a proceeding under the statute.
For example, $ 2254(d) refers to "any proceeding instituted
in a Federal court by an application for a writ of habeas
corpus" (emphasis added). Another statute setting filing
fees provides that "the parties instituting any . . . proceeding in [district court must] pay a filing fee of $120, except
that on application for a writ of habeas corpus the filing fee
shall be $5." 28 U. S. C. $ 1914(a) (emphasis added). This
indicates that the institution of a proceeding requires the
filing of an "application," which petitioner has not done. See

$ 2242 (an "[a]pplication for a writ of habeas corpus . . . shall
allege the facts concerning the applicant's commitment or
detention"); Habeas Corpus Rule 2(a) ("[T]he application
shall be in the form of a petition").

The rules governing $ 2254 cases confirm this conclusion.
Although originally enacted by this Court, the rules were
amended by Congress and approved as amended. See Pub.
L. 94-426, $ 1, 90 Stat. 1334 (1976). By their terms, the habeas rules only apply to "procedure[s] in the United States
district courts on applications under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254."
Rule 1(a) (emphasis added). See also Habeas Corpus Rule
2 (referring to "[a]pplicants in present custody" and "[a]pplicants subject to future custody"). These same rules also

make an express exception for the appointment of counsel"at any stage of the case," Rule 8(c), a further indication that

the rules otherwise apply after an application for a writ ofhabeas corpus has been filed in the district court. This consistent textual focus on the existence of an "application"leads me to conclude that the district court's authority to
issue a stay pursuant to $ 2251 also requires the filing of an"application."*

Congress is apparently aware of the clumsiness of its hand-iwork in authorizing appointment of an attorney under 21
U. S. C. $ 848(q)(4)(B) "[i]n any post conviction proceeding,"
while leaving intact 28 U. S. C. $ 2251, which authorizes a
stay only when a "habeas corpus proceeding is pending."See S. 1441, $ 3(b), 103d Cong., 1st Sess. (1993). The remedy

for this problem, however, lies with Congress, and not, asthe Court would have it, by reading the Anti-Drug Abuse
Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-690, 102 Stat. 4393, to impliedlyamend the habeas statute. See

Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U. S. 102, 134 (1974). Such a readingis inconsistent with our prior cases and with the important

federalism principles underlying the limited habeas jurisdiction of the federal courts. I would leave the matter to Con-gress to resolve. Finally, prisoners can avoid the need for a

stay by filing a prompt request for appointment of counselwell in advance of the scheduled execution.

In the judgment currently under review, the Court of Ap-peals for the Fifth Circuit held that petitioner's "motion for
stay of execution and appointment of counsel is . . . denied."7 F. 3d 47, 49 (1993)

the Court that petitioner is entitled to an attorney, I concur

*Because the habeas statute itself addresses when district courts may
order a stay of state proceedings, the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1651, does

not the All Writs Act, that is controlling." Pennsylvania Bureau of Correction v. United States Marshals Service, 474 U. S. 34, 43 (1985).

stay of execution before filing a petition for a writ of habeascorpus in the District Court, I would affirm the judgment
in part. I therefore respectfully dissent from the Court'scontrary determination.

Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Scalia join, dissenting.

Today the Court holds that a state prisoner under sen-tence of death may invoke a federal district court's jurisdiction to obtain appointed counsel under 21 U. S. C. $ 848(q)(4)(B) and to obtain a stay of execution under 28 U. S. C.

$ 2251 simply by filing a motion for appointment of counsel.In my view, the Court's conclusion is at odds with the terms
of both statutory provisions. Each statute allows a fed-eral district court to take action (appointing counsel under

$ 848(q)(4)(B) or granting a stay under $ 2251) only after ahabeas proceeding has been commenced. As

Justice
O'Connor points out, such a proceeding is initiated underthe habeas corpus statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 2241 et seq., only with

the filing of an application for a writ of habeas corpus. Itherefore agree with

Justice O'Connor that a district courtlacks jurisdiction to grant a stay under $ 2251 until such an

application has been filed. See ante, at 860-863 (concurringin judgment in part and dissenting in part). But because

$ 848(q)(4)(B), like $ 2251, conditions a court's power to actupon the existence of a habeas proceeding, I would also hold
that a district court cannot appoint counsel until an applica-tion for habeas relief has been filed. I therefore respectfully dissent. I

In its attempt to discern Congress' intent regarding thepoint at which $ 848(q)(4)(B) makes counsel available, the
Court spends a good deal of time considering how, as a "prac-tical matter," the provision of counsel can be made meaning512us3$93n 12-28-97 17:28:51 PAGES OPINPGT

ful. See ante, at 855. See also ante, at 860 (O'Connor, J.,concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). But

here, as in any case of statutory interpretation, our primaryguide to Congress' intent should be the text of the statute.
The relevant terms of $ 848(q)(4)(B) state that an indigent
prisoner shall be entitled to an attorney and "investigative,expert, or other reasonably necessary services" only "[i]n

any post conviction proceeding under section 2254 . . . seek-ing to vacate or set aside a death sentence." The clear import of the provision is that an indigent prisoner is not enti-tled to an attorney or to other services under the section
until a "post conviction proceeding under section 2254" ex-ists--that is, not until after such a proceeding has been commenced in district court.

The Court appears to acknowledge that a $ 2254 proceed-ing must be initiated before counsel can be appointed under

$ 848(q)(4)(B), but asserts that "[n]either the federal habeas
corpus statute . . . nor the rules governing habeas corpus
proceedings define a `post conviction proceeding' under

$ 2254 . . . or expressly state how such a proceeding shall be
commenced." Ante, at 854. It is difficult to imagine, however, how the federal habeas statute could be more "express"
on the matter. As Justice O'Connor explains in detail, the
statute makes clear that a "proceeding" is commenced only
with the filing of an application for a writ of habeas corpus.
See ante, at 862-863 (concurring in judgment in part and
dissenting in part).1 Section 2254(d), for example, provides
that the well-known presumption of correctness of state
court findings of fact attaches "[i]n any proceeding instituted

1 Justice O'Connor, of course, discusses the question of how a habeas
"proceeding" is commenced in the context of determining whether a district court has jurisdiction under $ 2251 to enter a stay of execution prior
to the filing of an application for habeas relief. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2251 ("A
justice or judge of the United States before whom a habeas corpus proceeding is pending, may . . . stay any proceeding against the person detained" under state authority) (emphasis added).

in a Federal court by an application for a writ of habeas
corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of
a State court." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d) (emphasis added). See
also $ 2241(d) (power to grant the writ is not triggered except
by "application for a writ of habeas corpus"). Cf. $ 1914
(equating the filing of an "application for a writ of habeas
corpus" with the "instituting" of a "proceeding" for purposes
of setting filing fees).2

By providing that death-sentenced prisoners may obtain
counsel "[i]n any post conviction proceeding under section
2254," Congress referred to a well-known form of action with
established contours. We should therefore assume that
Congress intended to incorporate into $ 848(q)(4)(B) the settled understanding of what constitutes a "proceeding under
section 2254" in the habeas statute. Cf. Miles v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U. S. 19, 32 (1990). Indeed, the similarity
between the language in $$ 848(q)(4)(B) and 2254(d) suggests
that Congress used the phrase "[i]n any post conviction proceeding under section 2254" in the former provision as a
shorthand form of the language "[i]n any proceeding instituted in a Federal court by an application for a writ of habeas
corpus" contained in the latter. In short, the terms of

$ 848(q)(4)(B) indicate that Congress intended that legal assistance be made available under the provision only after a
habeas proceeding has been commenced by the filing of an
application for habeas relief.

2 The procedural rules governing $ 2254 cases confirm that it is the filing
of a habeas petition that commences a habeas proceeding. Rule 3 of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure clearly states that "[a] civil action is
commenced by filing a complaint." The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
apply in the context of habeas suits to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the Habeas Corpus Rules. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 Rule 11;
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 81(a)(2). The analogue to a complaint in the habeas
context is an "application . . . in the form of a petition for a writ of habeas
corpus." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 Rule 2(a). Thus, a habeas action is commenced with the filing of such an application.

The Court rejects this interpretation. Rather than turn-ing to the habeas statute for guidance in determining when

a "proceeding under section 2254" commences, the Courtbases its examination of the question primarily on what it
perceives to be the time at which legal assistance would be
most useful to a death-sentenced prisoner. See ante, at 855-856. From this analysis, the Court concludes that a " `post

conviction proceeding' within the meaning of $ 848(q)(4)(B) iscommenced by the filing of a death row defendant's [preapplication] motion requesting the appointment of counsel."
Ante, at 856. The only textual provision the Court cites in
support of that conclusion is 21 U. S. C. $ 848(q)(9), whichstates:

"Upon a finding in ex parte proceedings that investiga-tive, expert or other services are reasonably necessary
for the representation of the defendant, whether in con-nection with issues relating to guilt or sentence, the
court shall authorize the defendant's attorneys to obtain
such services on behalf of the defendant and shall orderthe payment of fees and expenses therefore . . . ."

At bottom, the Court's textual argument amounts to the
following: because investigative, expert, and other servicesdescribed in $ 848(q)(9) "may be critical in the preapplication phase of a habeas corpus proceeding," ante, at 855, and
because $ 848(q)(9) provides that those services are to beobtained by the defendant's attorneys, an attorney must be

appointed "before the need for such technical assistancearises"--that is, prior to the filing of an application for habeas
relief. Ibid. Thus, the sole textual source upon which the
Court relies is the statement that "the defendant's attorneys"
are "authorize[d]" to obtain services on the defendant's behalf.

In my view, such an oblique reference to "the defendant's
attorneys" is a remarkably thin reed upon which to rest Congress' supposed intention to "establis[h] a right to preapplication legal assistance for capital defendants in federal

habeas corpus proceedings." Ibid. Indeed, had Congressintended to establish such a "right," it surely would have

done so in $ 848(q)(4)(B), which provides for appointment ofcounsel, rather than in $ 848(q)(9), which sets forth the mechanics of how "investigative, expert or other services" are
to be obtained.Moreover, $ 848(q)(9) simply does not address the issue of

when "investigative, expert or other services" are to bemade available to a death-sentenced prisoner. The Court
asserts that such services "may be critical" in the preappli-cation period.

Ibid. Yet the issue of when these services
are to be available, like the question of when a prisoner isentitled to counsel, is expressly addressed not in $ 848(q)(9),

but in $ 848(q)(4). See $ 848(q)(4)(A) (indigent defendant
"charged with a [federal] crime which may be punishable bydeath" may obtain "representation [and] investigative, expert, or other reasonably necessary services" both "beforejudgment" and "after the entry of a judgment imposing a
sentence of death but before the execution of that judg-ment"); see also $ 848(q)(4)(B) (indigent prisoner "seeking to
vacate or set aside [his] death sentence" may obtain "repre-sentation [and] investigative, expert, or other reasonably
necessary services" "[i]n any post conviction proceeding
under section 2254 or 2255"). And for purposes of this case,

$ 848(q)(4)(B) resolves the issue: Such services are to be made
available only after a "post conviction proceeding under
2254" has been commenced.

As for the policy concerns rehearsed by the Court, I agree
that legal assistance prior to the filing of a federal habeas
petition can be very valuable to a prisoner. See ante, at
855-856. That such assistance is valuable, however, does
not compel the conclusion that Congress intended the Federal Government to pay for it under $ 848(q). As the Ninth
Circuit has aptly observed: "Section 848(q) is a funding statute. It provides for the appointment of attorneys and the
furnishing of investigative services for [federal] defendants
or habeas corpus petitioners seeking to vacate or set aside a

death sentence." Jackson v. Vasquez, 1 F. 3d 885, 888 (1993)
(emphasis added). It might well be a wise and generous policy for the Government to provide prisoners appointed counsel prior to the filing of a habeas petition, but that is not a
policy declared by Congress in the terms of $ 848(q)(4)(B).

Implicit in the Court's analysis is the assumption that it
would be unthinkable for Congress to grant an entitlement
to appointed counsel, but to have that entitlement attach
only upon the filing of a habeas petition. The Court suggests that its interpretation is required because it is "the
only one that gives meaning to the statute as a practical
matter." Ante, at 855 (emphasis added). Any other interpretation, according to the Court, would "requir[e] an indigent capital petitioner to proceed without counsel in order
to obtain counsel." Ante, at 856. Yet under the interpretation of $ 848(q)(4)(B) I have outlined above, Congress has not
required death-sentenced prisoners to proceed without counsel during the preapplication period; rather, it has merely
concluded that such prisoners would proceed without counsel
funded under $ 848(q)(4)(B).

Moreover, leaving prisoners without counsel appointed
under $ 848(q)(4)(B) during the preapplication period would
be fully reasonable. Congress was no doubt aware that alternative sources of funding for preapplication legal assistance exist for death-sentenced prisoners. Petitioner, for example, is represented by the Texas Resource Center, which
has been "designated . . . a Community Defender Organization in accordance with 18 U. S. C. $ 3006A for the purpose of
providing representation, assistance, information, and other
related services to eligible persons and appointed attorneys
in connection with" federal habeas corpus cases arising from
capital convictions. Brief for Petitioner 4, n. 3 (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted). The center, which is
"funded primarily by a grant from the Administrative Office
of the United States Courts," id., at 5, n. 4, became involved
in petitioner's case soon after his conviction was affirmed

Thomas, J., dissenting
by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Thus, althoughpetitioner did not have preapplication assistance of counsel

made available to him under $ 848(q)(4)(B), he still could ben-efit from federally funded legal assistance.

In addition, it seems likely that Congress expected that theStates would also shoulder some of the burden of providing
preapplication legal assistance to indigent death-sentencedprisoners. Cf.

Hill v. Lockhart, 992 F. 2d 801, 803 (CA8 1993)("A state that has elected to impose the death penalty should

provide adequate funding for the procedures it has adopted toproperly implement that penalty"). Defendants under a
state-imposed sentence of death must exhaust state remediesby presenting their claims in state court prior to coming to federal court. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b). See also Coleman v.
Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991). Given this exhaustion re-quirement, it would have been logical for Congress, in drafting

$ 848(q)(4)(B), to assume that by the time a death-sentencedprisoner reaches federal court, "possible claims and their factual bases" will already have been "researched and identified."
Ante, at 855. Indeed, if the claims have not been identifiedand presented to state courts, a prisoner cannot proceed on

federal habeas. See Coleman, supra, at 731 ("This Court haslong held that a state prisoner's federal habeas petition should
be dismissed if the prisoner has not exhausted available stateremedies as to any of his federal claims"). Thus, it would not
have been unreasonable for Congress to require prisoners tomeet the ordinary requirement for invoking a federal court's
habeas jurisdiction--namely, the filing of an adequate applica-tion for habeas corpus relief--prior to obtaining an attorney
under $ 848(q)(4)(B). II

Had the Court ended its analysis with the ruling that anindigent death-sentenced prisoner is entitled to counsel
under $ 848(q)(4)(B) prior to filing an application for habeasrelief, today's decision would have an impact on federal coffers, but would not expand the power of the federal courts

to interfere with States' legitimate interests in enforcing thejudgments of their criminal justice systems. The Court,

however, does not stop with its decision on availability ofcounsel; rather, it goes on to hold that upon a motion for
appointment of counsel, a death-sentenced prisoner is also
able to obtain a stay of his execution in order to permit coun-sel "to research and present [his] habeas claims."

Ante, at
858.The Court reaches its decision through the sheerest form

of bootstrapping. After reasoning that "a proceeding undersection 2254" for purposes of $ 848(q)(4)(B) commences with
the filing of a motion for appointment of counsel, the Court
imports that meaning of "proceeding" into 28 U. S. C. $ 2251,
which provides that a federal judge "before whom a habeas
corpus proceeding is pending" may "stay any proceeding
against the person detained in any State court" (emphasis
added). The Court thus concludes that "once a capital defendant invokes his right to appointed counsel, a federal
court also has jurisdiction under $ 2251 to enter a stay of
execution." Ante, at 858. I agree with the Court that the
"language of [$$ 848(q)(4)(B) and 2251] indicates that the sections refer to the same proceeding." Ibid. But the method
the Court employs to impart meaning to the term "proceeding" in the two provisions is simply backwards. Section
848(q)(4)(B) was enacted as part of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act
of 1988, Pub. L. 100-690, 102 Stat. 4393, long after the enactment of the habeas statute. As noted above, in using the
terms "post conviction proceeding under section 2254" in

$ 848(q)(4)(B), Congress was referring to a form of action
whose contours were well established under the habeas statute. As a matter of basic statutory construction, then, we
should look to the habeas statute to inform our construction
of $ 848(q)(4)(B), not vice versa.

The reason the Court pursues a different approach is clear:
There is no basis in the habeas statute for reading "habeas
corpus proceeding" in $ 2251 to mean an action commenced

512us3$93n 12-28-97 17:28:51 PAGES OPINPGT
872 McFARLAND v. SCOTT

Thomas, J., dissenting
by the filing of a motion for appointment of counsel. Thus,to avoid the conclusion that a "proceeding" in $ 2251 is commenced by the filing of an application for habeas relief, theCourt is forced to hold that by enacting $ 848(q), Congress
amended the habeas statute sub silentio. Cf. ante, at 863(

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissentingin part).

3 In effect, the Court determines that Congress, in

providing death-sentenced prisoners with federally fundedcounsel in $ 848(q)(4)(B), intended to expand the jurisdiction

of the federal courts to stay state proceedings under the ha-beas statute. Yet $ 848(q)(4)(B) in no way suggests a connection between the availability of counsel and the staypower; indeed, the provision does not even mention the term
"stay." A proper interpretation of the provisions at issuehere, however, avoids the dubious assumption that Congress
intended to effect such an amendment of the habeas statuteby implication. Correctly interpreted, both $$ 848(q)(4)(B)
and 2251 refer to a "proceeding" that begins with the filingof an application for habeas relief, after which a federal court
has jurisdiction to enter a stay and to appoint counsel.In reaching its expansive interpretation of $ 2251, the
Court ignores the fact that the habeas statute provides fed-eral courts with exceptional powers. Federal habeas review
"disturbs the State's significant interest in repose for con-cluded litigation, denies society the right to punish some admitted offenders, and intrudes on state sovereignty to a de-gree matched by few exercises of federal judicial authority."

3 Presumably, the Court's holding regarding a federal court's jurisdiction
to stay a state proceeding only applies when a state prisoner is "seeking
to vacate or set aside a death sentence." 21 U. S. C. $ 848(q)(4)(B). Thus,
after today, the "proceeding" to which $ 2251 refers will have two different
meanings depending upon whether the stay is sought by a capital or noncapital prisoner. In the former situation, a "habeas corpus proceeding"
under $ 2251 will be "pending" once a motion for appointment of counsel
is filed. In the latter, no matter how many preliminary motions a prisoner
might file, a proceeding will not be "pending" until an application for habeas relief is filed.

See also ante, at 863 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgmentin part and dissenting in part). We should not lightly assume that Congress intended to expand federal courts' ha-beas power; this is particularly true regarding their power
directly to interfere with state proceedings through grant-ing stays.

Moreover, as Justice O'Connor observes, in expandingthe federal courts' power to grant stays, the Court's decision
"conflicts with the sound principle underlying our precedentsthat federal habeas review exists only to review errors of
constitutional dimension." Ante, at 861 (concurring in judg-ment in part and dissenting in part). Under the Court's interpretation of $ 2251, a prisoner may obtain a stay of execu-tion without presenting a single claim to a federal court.
Indeed, under the Court's reading of the statute, a federaldistrict court determining whether to enter a stay will no
longer have to evaluate whether a prisoner has presenteda potentially meritorious constitutional claim. Rather, the
court's task will be to determine whether a "capital defend-ant" who comes to federal court shortly before his scheduled
execution has been "dilatory" in pursuing his "right to coun-sel."

Ante, at 858. If he has not been "dilatory," the dis-trict court presumably must enter a stay to preserve his

"right to counsel" and his "right for that counsel meaning-fully to research and present [his] habeas claims."

Ibid. Inmy view, simply by providing for the appointment of counsel

in habeas cases, Congress did not intend to achieve such anextraordinary result.

Because petitioner had not filed an application for habeasrelief prior to filing his motion for stay of execution and for

appointment of counsel, the courts below correctly deter-mined that they lacked jurisdiction to consider his motion.

HOLDER, individually and in his official capacity

as COUNTY COMMISSIONER FOR BLECKLEY

COUNTY, GEORGIA, et al. v. HALL et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 91-2012. Argued October 4, 1993--Decided June 30, 1994
Bleckley County, Georgia, has always had a form of government whereby

a single commissioner holds all legislative and executive authority. In
1985, the state legislature authorized the county to adopt by referendum
a multimember commission consisting of five members elected from
single-member districts and a chair elected at large, but voters defeated
the proposal, although they had previously approved a five-member district plan for the county school board. Respondents, black voters and
the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, filed this action. The District Court rejected their constitutional claim that the single-member commission was enacted or
maintained with an intent to exclude or limit the political influence of
the county's black community in violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. The court also ruled against their claim that the
commission's size violated $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, finding
that respondents satisfied only one of the three preconditions established in Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30. The Court of Appeals
reversed on the statutory claim, holding that the totality of the circumstances supported $ 2 liability and remanding for a formulation of a remedy, which it suggested could be modeled after the county's school board
election system.

Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
955 F. 2d 1563, reversed and remanded.

Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice
O'Connor, concluded in Parts I, II-A, and III:

1. The size of a governing authority is not subject to a vote dilution
challenge under $ 2. Along with determining whether the Gingles preconditions are met and whether the totality of the circumstances support a liability finding, a court in a $ 2 suit must find a reasonable alternative practice as a benchmark against which to measure the existing
voting practice. However, there is no objective and workable standard
for choosing a reasonable benchmark where, as here, the challenge is
brought to the government body's size. There is no reason why one

Syllabus
size should be picked over another. Respondents have offered no convincing reasons why the benchmark should be a hypothetical fivemember commission. That such a commission is the most common form
of governing authority in the State does not bear on dilution, since a sole
commissioner system has the same impact on voting strength whether it
is shared by none, or by all, of Georgia's counties. That the county was
authorized to expand its commission, and that it adopted a five-member
school board, are likewise irrelevant considerations. At most, they indicate that the county could change the size of its governing body with
minimal disruption, but the failure to do so says nothing about the effects the current system has on the county citizens' voting power.
Pp. 880-882.

2. The case is remanded for consideration of respondents' constitutional claim. P. 885.

Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice, concluded in Part
II-B that a voting practice subject to the preclearance requirement of

$ 5 of the Act is not necessarily subject to a dilution challenge under $ 2.
The sections differ in structure, purpose, and application; and in contrast
to $ 2 cases, a baseline for comparison under $ 5 exists by definition: A
proposed voting practice is measured against the existing practice to
determine whether retrogression would result from the proposed
change. Pp. 882-885.

Justice O'Connor concluded that precedent compels the conclusion
that the size of a governing authority is both a "standard, practice, or
procedure" under $ 2 and a "standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting" under $ 5, but agreed that a $ 2 dilution challenge to a
governing authority's size cannot be maintained because there can never
be an objective alternative benchmark for comparison. Pp. 885-888.

Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, concluded that the size
of a governing body cannot be attacked under $ 2 because it is not a
"standard, practice, or procedure" within the terms of $ 2. An examination of $ 2's text makes it clear that those terms refer only to practices
that affect minority citizens' access to the ballot. Districting systems
and electoral mechanisms that may affect the "weight" given to a ballot
duly cast and counted are simply beyond the purview of the Act. The
decision in Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, which interprets $ 2 to
reach claims of vote "dilution," should be overruled. Gingles was based
upon a flawed method of statutory construction and has produced an
interpretation of $ 2 that is at odds with the text of the Act and that has
proved unworkable in practice. Pp. 891-946.

The State of Georgia has 159 counties, one of which isBleckley County, a rural county in central Georgia. Black

persons make up nearly 20% of the eligible voting popula-tion in Bleckley County. Since its creation in 1912, the
county has had a single-commissioner form of governmentfor the exercise of "county governing authority." See Ga.
Code Ann. $ 1-3-3(7) (Supp. 1993). Under this system, the

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
Bleckley County Commissioner performs all of the executiveand legislative functions of the county government, including

the levying of general and special taxes, the directing andcontrolling of all county property, and the settling of all
claims. Ga. Code Ann. $ 36-5-22.1 (1993). In addition to
Bleckley County, about 10 other Georgia counties use thesingle-commissioner system; the rest have multimember

commissions.In 1985, the Georgia Legislature authorized Bleckley
County to adopt a multimember commission consisting offive commissioners elected from single-member districts and
a single chairman elected at large. 1985 Ga. Laws, p. 4406.
In a referendum held in 1986, however, the electorate did not
adopt the change to a multimember commission. (In a similar referendum four years earlier, county voters had approved a five-member district plan for the election of the
county school board.)

In 1985, respondents (six black registered voters from
Bleckley County and the Cochran/Bleckley County Chapter
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People) challenged the single-commissioner system in a suit
filed against petitioners (Jackie Holder, the incumbent
county commissioner, and Probate Judge Robert Johnson,
the superintendent of elections). The complaint raised both
a constitutional and a statutory claim.

In their constitutional claim, respondents alleged that the
county's single-member commission was enacted or maintained with an intent to exclude or to limit the political influence of the county's black community in violation of the
Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. At the outset, the
District Court made extensive findings of fact about the political history and dynamics of Bleckley County. The court
found, for example, that when the county was formed in 1912,
few, if any, black citizens could vote. Indeed, until passage
of federal civil rights laws, Bleckley County "enforced racial
segregation in all aspects of local government--courthouse,

jails, public housing, governmental services--and deprivedits black citizens of the opportunity to participate in local

government." 757 F. Supp. 1560, 1562 (MD Ga. 1991). Andeven today, though legal segregation no longer exists, "more
black than white residents of Bleckley County continue to
endure a depressed socio-economic status." Ibid. No blackperson has run for or been elected to the office of Bleckley

County Commissioner, and the District Judge stated that,having run for public office himself, he "wouldn't run if [he]
were black in Bleckley [C]ounty." See 955 F. 2d 1563, 1571(CA11 1992).

The court rejected respondents' constitutional contention,
however, concluding that respondents "ha[d] failed to provide any evidence that Bleckley County's single member
county commission [wa]s the product of original or continued
racial animus or discriminatory intent." 757 F. Supp., at
1571. Nor was there evidence that the system was maintained "for tenuous reasons" or that the commissioner himself was unresponsive to the "particularized needs" of the
black community. Id., at 1564. There was no "slating process" to stand as a barrier to black candidates, and there was
testimony from respondents that they were unaware of any
racial appeals in recent elections. Id., at 1562, n. 2, 1583.

In their statutory claim, respondents asserted that the
county's single-member commission violated $ 2 of the Voting
Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 437, as amended, 42 U. S. C.

$ 1973. Under the statute, the suit contended, Bleckley
County must have a county commission of sufficient size that,
with single-member election districts, the county's black citizens would constitute a majority in one of the single-member
districts. Applying the $ 2 framework established in Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30 (1986), the District Court found
that respondents satisfied the first of the three Gingles preconditions because black voters were sufficiently numerous
and compact that they could have constituted a majority in
one district of a multimember commission. In particular,

the District Court found that "[i]f the county commissionwere increased in number to six commissioners to be elected

from five single member districts and if the districts werethe same as the present school board election districts, a
black majority `safe' district . . . would result." 757 F. Supp.,
at 1565. The court found, however, that respondents failedto satisfy the second and third

Gingles preconditions--that
whites vote as a bloc in a manner sufficient to defeat theblack-preferred candidate and that blacks were politically

cohesive.The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed on
the statutory claim. Relying on its decision in Carrollton
Branch of NAACP v. Stallings, 829 F. 2d 1547 (1987), the
court first held that a challenge to the single-commissioner
system was subject to the same analysis as that used in Gingles. Applying that analysis, the Court of Appeals agreed
with the District Court that respondents had satisfied the
first Gingles precondition by showing that blacks could constitute a majority of the electorate in one of five singlemember districts. The court explained that it was "appropriate to consider the size and geographical compactness of
the minority group within a restructured form of the challenged system when the existing structure is being challenged as dilutive." 955 F. 2d, at 1569. The Court of Appeals further found that the District Court had erred in
concluding that the second and third Gingles preconditions

were not met. Turning to the totality of the circumstances,
the court found that those circumstances supported a finding
of liability under $ 2. The court therefore concluded that respondents had proved a violation of $ 2, and it remanded for
formulation of a remedy, which, it suggested, "could well be
modeled" after the system used to elect the Bleckley County
school board. 955 F. 2d, at 1573-1574, and n. 20. Because
of its statutory ruling, the Court of Appeals did not consider
the District Court's ruling on respondents' constitutional
claim.

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
We granted certiorari to review the statutory holding ofthe Court of Appeals. 507 U. S. 959 (1993).

A
Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 provides that"[n]o voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied byany State or political subdivision in a manner which results
in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of theUnited States to vote on account of race or color." 42
U. S. C. $ 1973(a). In a $ 2 vote dilution suit, along with de-termining whether the Gingles preconditions are met

1 and

whether the totality of the circumstances supports a findingof liability, a court must find a reasonable alternative practice as a benchmark against which to measure the existingvoting practice. See post, at 887 (

O'Connor, J., concurringin part and concurring in judgment). As

Justice O'Connor explained in Gingles: "The phrase vote dilution itselfsuggests a norm with respect to which the fact of dilution

may be ascertained . . . . [I]n order to decide whether anelectoral system has made it harder for minority voters to
elect the candidates they prefer, a court must have an ideain mind of how hard it should be for minority voters to elect
their preferred candidates under an acceptable system."478 U. S., at 88 (opinion concurring in judgment) (internal
quotation marks omitted).In certain cases, the benchmark for comparison in a $ 2
dilution suit is obvious. The effect of an anti-single-shotvoting rule, for instance, can be evaluated by comparing the

1 Gingles requires a showing that "the minority group . . . is sufficiently
large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a singlemember district," 478 U. S., at 50, that the minority group is politically
cohesive, and that the majority group "votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable
it--in the absence of special circumstances . . . usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate," id., at 51.

system with that rule to the system without that rule. Butwhere there is no objective and workable standard for choosing a reasonable benchmark by which to evaluate a chal-lenged voting practice, it follows that the voting practice
cannot be challenged as dilutive under $ 2. See post, at
887-891 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring injudgment).

As the facts of this case well illustrate, the search for abenchmark is quite problematic when a $ 2 dilution challenge
is brought to the size of a government body. There is noprincipled reason why one size should be picked over another
as the benchmark for comparison. Respondents here argue
that we should compare Bleckley County's sole commissioner
system to a hypothetical five-member commission in order
to determine whether the current system is dilutive. Respondents and the United States as amicus curiae give three
reasons why the single-commissioner structure should be
compared to a five-member commission (instead of, say, a
3-, 10-, or 15-member body): (1) because the five-member
commission is a common form of governing authority in
the State; (2) because the state legislature had authorized
Bleckley County to adopt a five-member commission if it so
chose (it did not); and (3) because the county had moved from
a single superintendent of education to a school board with
five members elected from single-member districts. See
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 17-18.

These referents do not bear upon dilution. It does not
matter, for instance, how popular the single-member commission system is in Georgia in determining whether it dilutes the vote of a minority racial group in Bleckley County.
That the single-member commission is uncommon in the
State of Georgia, or that a five-member commission is quite
common, tells us nothing about its effects on a minority
group's voting strength. The sole commissioner system has

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
sense to say (as do respondents and the United States) thatthe sole commissioner system should be subject to a dilution

challenge if it is rare--but immune if it is common.That Bleckley County was authorized by the State to
expand its commission, and that it adopted a five-memberschool board, are likewise irrelevant considerations in the
dilution inquiry. At most, those facts indicate that BleckleyCounty could change the size of its commission with minimal
disruption. But the county's failure to do so says nothingabout the effects the sole commissioner system has on the
voting power of Bleckley County's citizens. Surely a minor-ity group's voting strength would be no more or less diluted
had the State not authorized the county to alter the size ofits commission, or had the county not enlarged its school
board. One gets the sense that respondents and the UnitedStates have chosen a benchmark for the sake of having a
benchmark. But it is one thing to say that a benchmark canbe found, quite another to give a convincing reason for finding it in the first place. B

To bolster their argument, respondents point out that our$ 5 cases may be interpreted to indicate that covered jurisdictions may not change the size of their government bodieswithout obtaining preclearance from the Attorney General
or the federal courts. Brief for Respondents 29; see Presleyv.

Etowah County Comm'n, 502 U. S. 491, 501-503 (1992);City of Lockhart v. United States, 460 U. S. 125, 131-132

(1983); City of Rome v. United States, 446 U. S. 156, 161(1980). Respondents contend that these $ 5 cases, together
with the similarity in language between $$ 2 and 5 of the Act,compel the conclusion that the size of a government body
must be subject to a dilution challenge under $ 2. It is truethat in

Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U. S. 380, 401-402 (1991), wesaid that the coverage of $$ 2 and 5 is presumed to be the

same (at least if differential coverage would be anomalous).We did not adopt a conclusive rule to that effect, however,

and we do not think that the fact that a change in a votingpractice must be precleared under $ 5 necessarily means that

the voting practice is subject to challenge in a dilution suitunder $ 2.

To be sure, if the structure and purpose of $ 2 mirroredthat of $ 5, then the case for interpreting $$ 2 and 5 to have
the same application in all cases would be convincing. Butthe two sections differ in structure, purpose, and application.2 Section 5 applies only in certain jurisdictions speci-fied by Congress and "only to proposed changes in voting
procedures." Beer v. United States, 425 U. S. 130, 138(1976); see 42 U. S. C. $ 1973b(b) (specifying jurisdictions
where $ 5 applies). In those covered jurisdictions, a pro-posed change in a voting practice must be approved in advance by the Attorney General or the federal courts.$ 1973c. The purpose of this requirement "has always been
to insure that no voting-procedure changes would be madethat would lead to a retrogression in the position of racial
minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the elec-toral franchise." 425 U. S., at 141. Under $ 5, then, the proposed voting practice is measured against the existing votingpractice to determine whether retrogression would result
from the proposed change. See ibid. The baseline for comparison is present by definition; it is the existing status.While there may be difficulty in determining whether a pro2 Section 2 provides that "[n]o voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any
State or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or
abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on
account of race or color." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(a).

Section 5 requires preclearance approval by a court or by the Attorney
General "[w]henever a [covered] State or political subdivision . . . shall
enact or seek to administer any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting . . . different
from that [previously] in force or effect" so as to ensure that it "does not
have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the
right to vote on account of race or color . . . ." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c.

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
posed change would cause retrogression, there is little diffi-culty in discerning the two voting practices to compare to

determine whether retrogression would occur. See 28 CFR$ 51.54(b) (1993).

Retrogression is not the inquiry in $ 2 dilution cases. 42
U. S. C. $ 1973(a) (whether voting practice "results in a denialor abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United

States to vote on account of race or color"); S. Rep. No. 97-417, p. 68, n. 224 (1982) ("Plaintiffs could not establish a
Section 2 violation merely by showing that a challengedreapportionment or annexation, for example, involved a
retrogressive effect on the political strength of a minority
group"). Unlike in $ 5 cases, therefore, a benchmark does
not exist by definition in $ 2 dilution cases. And as explained above, with some voting practices, there in fact may
be no appropriate benchmark to determine if an existing voting practice is dilutive under $ 2. For that reason, a voting
practice that is subject to the preclearance requirements of

$ 5 is not necessarily subject to a dilution challenge under $ 2.

This conclusion is quite unremarkable. For example, in
Perkins v. Matthews, 400 U. S. 379, 388 (1971), we held that
a town's annexation of land was covered under $ 5. Notwithstanding that holding, we think it quite improbable to suggest that a $ 2 dilution challenge could be brought to a town's
existing political boundaries (in an attempt to force it to
annex surrounding land) by arguing that the current boundaries dilute a racial group's voting strength in comparison
to the proposed new boundaries. Likewise, in McCain v.
Lybrand, 465 U. S. 236 (1984), we indicated that a change
from an appointive to an elected office was covered under

$ 5. Here, again, we doubt Congress contemplated that a
racial group could bring a $ 2 dilution challenge to an appointive office (in an attempt to force a change to an elective
office) by arguing that the appointive office diluted its voting
strength in comparison to the proposed elective office. We
think these examples serve to show that a voting practice is

not necessarily subject to a dilution challenge under $ 2 evenwhen a change in that voting practice would be subject to

the preclearance requirements of $ 5.

III
With respect to challenges to the size of a governing au-thority, respondents fail to explain where the search for reasonable alternative benchmarks should begin and end, andthey provide no acceptable principles for deciding future
cases. The wide range of possibilities makes the choice "in-herently standardless," post, at 889 (

O'Connor, J., concur-ring in part and concurring in judgment), and we therefore

conclude that a plaintiff cannot maintain a $ 2 challenge tothe size of a government body, such as the Bleckley County
Commission. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is re-versed, and the case is remanded for consideration of respondents' constitutional claim. It is so ordered.

Justice O'Connor, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.
I agree with Justices Kennedy and Thomas that a plain-tiff cannot maintain a $ 2 vote dilution challenge to the size
of a governing authority, though I reach that conclusion by asomewhat different rationale.

Justice Thomas rejects thenotion that $ 2 covers
any dilution challenges, and would holdthat $ 2 is limited to "state enactments that regulate citizens'

access to the ballot or the processes for counting a ballot."Post, at 945. As

Justice Stevens points out, however,
stare decisis concerns weigh heavily here. Post, at 963-966(opinion of

Stevens, J.); see also Thornburg v. Gingles, 478U. S. 30, 84 (1986) (

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment)("We know that Congress intended to allow vote dilution

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Thomas' suggestion that we overhaul our established reading of $ 2.

I also agree with Justice Blackmun, see post, at 946-
950, that our precedents compel the conclusion that the size
of the Bleckley County Commission is both a "standard, practice, or procedure" under $ 2 and a "standard, practice, or
procedure with respect to voting" under $ 5. See, e. g.,
Presley v. Etowah County Comm'n, 502 U. S. 491, 503 (1992)
(change in size is a change in a "standard, practice, or procedure" because the change "increase[s] or diminish[es] the
number of officials for whom the electorate may vote"); City
of Lockhart v. United States, 460 U. S. 125, 131-132 (1983)
(change from three-member commission to five-member commission is subject to $ 5 preclearance); City of Rome v.
United States, 446 U. S. 156, 160-161 (1980) (it "is not disputed" that an expansion in the size of a board of education
is subject to $ 5 preclearance); Bunton v. Patterson, decided
with Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U. S. 544, 569-571
(1969) (change from elected to appointed office is subject to

$ 5 preclearance); id., at 566-567 ($ 2 should be given "the
broadest possible scope").

As Justices Kennedy and Blackmun both recognize, in
these cases we have consistently said that a change in size is
a "standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting"
that is subject to $ 5 preclearance. See ante, at 882 (opinion
of Kennedy, J.); post, at 946-948 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).
And though our cases involving size have concerned $ 5, I do
not think it possible to read the terms of $ 2 more narrowly
than the terms of $ 5. Section 2 covers any "standard, practice, or procedure," while $ 5 covers any "standard, practice,
or procedure with respect to voting." As a textual matter,
I cannot see how a practice can be a "standard, practice, or
procedure with respect to voting," yet not be a "standard,
practice, or procedure." Indeed, the similarity in language
led to our conclusion in Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U. S. 380,

887Cite as: 512 U. S. 874 (1994)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
401-402 (1991), that, at least for determining threshold cov-erage, $$ 2 and 5 have parallel scope.

But determining the threshold scope of coverage does notend the inquiry, at least so far as $ 2 dilution challenges are
concerned. As Justices Kennedy and Blackmun agree,
the fact that the size of a governing authority is a "stand-ard, practice, or procedure" does not answer the question

whether respondents may maintain a $ 2 vote dilution chal-lenge. See

ante, at 880 (opinion of Kennedy, J.); post, at
951 (Blackmun, J., dissenting). Section 2 vote dilutionplaintiffs must establish that the challenged practice is dilutive. In order for an electoral system to dilute a minority
group's voting power, there must be an alternative system
that would provide greater electoral opportunity to minority
voters. "Put simply, in order to decide whether an electoral
system has made it harder for minority voters to elect the
candidates they prefer, a court must have an idea in mind
of how hard it `should' be for minority voters to elect their
preferred candidates under an acceptable system." Gingles,
478 U. S., at 88 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). As
we have said, "[u]nless minority voters possess the potential
to elect representatives in the absence of the challenged
structure or practice, they cannot claim to have been injured
by that structure or practice." Id., at 50, n. 17 (emphasis
in original); see also id., at 99 (O'Connor, J., concurring in
judgment) ("[T]he relative lack of minority electoral success
under a challenged plan, when compared with the success
that would be predicted under the measure of undiluted minority voting strength the court is employing, can constitute
powerful evidence of vote dilution") (emphasis added).

Accordingly, to determine whether voters possess the potential to elect representatives of choice in the absence of
the challenged structure, courts must choose an objectively
reasonable alternative practice as a benchmark for the dilution comparison. On this, there is general agreement. See
ante, at 880 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) ("[A] court must find a

reasonable alternative practice as a benchmark againstwhich to measure the existing voting practice");

post, at 951
(Blackmun, J., dissenting) ("[T]he allegedly dilutive mecha-nism must be measured against the benchmark of an alternative structure or practice that is reasonable and workable
under the facts of the specific case"). We require preclear-ance of changes in size under $ 5, because in a $ 5 case the

question of an alternative benchmark never arises--thebenchmark is simply the former practice employed by the
jurisdiction seeking approval of a change. See ante, at 883(opinion of

Kennedy, J.).
But $ 2 dilution challenges raise more difficult questions.
This case presents the question whether, in a $ 2 dilution
challenge to size, there can ever be an objective alternative
benchmark for comparison. And I agree with Justice
Kennedy that there cannot be. As Justice Kennedy
points out, ante, at 880, the alternative benchmark is often
self-evident. In a challenge to a multimember at-large system, for example, a court may compare it to a system of
multiple single-member districts. See Gingles, supra, at 38,
50; Davidson, Minority Vote Dilution: An Overview, in Minority Vote Dilution 5 (C. Davidson ed. 1984). Similarly, a
court may assess the dilutive effect of majority vote requirements, numbered posts, staggered terms, residency requirements, or anti-single-shot rules by comparing the election
results under a system with the challenged practice to the
results under a system without the challenged practice. Cf.
City of Rome, supra, at 183-185; U. S. Comm'n on Civil
Rights, The Voting Rights Act: Ten Years After, pp. 206-208
(1975); Note, Application of Section 2 of the Voting Rights
Act to Runoff Primary Election Laws, 91 Colum. L. Rev.
1127, 1148 (1991). Though there may be disagreements
about the precise appropriate alternative practice in these
cases, see Gingles, supra, at 88-89 (O'Connor, J., concurring
in judgment), there are at least some objectively determinable constraints on the dilution inquiry.

889Cite as: 512 U. S. 874 (1994)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
This is not so with $ 2 dilution challenges to size, however.In a dilution challenge to the size of a governing authority,

choosing the alternative for comparison--a hypotheticallarger (or smaller) governing authority--is extremely problematic. See ante, at 881-882 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).
The wide range of possibilities makes the choice inherentlystandardless. Here, for example, respondents argued that

the single-member commission structure was dilutive incomparison to a five-member structure, in which AfricanAmericans would probably have been able to elect one rep-resentative of their choice. Some groups, however, will
not be able to constitute a majority in one of five districts.
Once a court accepts respondents' reasoning, it will have to
allow a plaintiff group insufficiently large or geographically
compact to form a majority in one of five districts to argue
that the jurisdiction's failure to establish a 10-, 15-, or 25-
commissioner structure is dilutive. See, e. g., Romero v. Pomona, 883 F. 2d 1418, 1425, n. 10 (CA9 1989); Heath, Managing the Political Thicket: Developing Objective Standards in
Voting Rights Litigation, 21 Stetson L. Rev. 819, 827 (1992)
("[O]nce one departs from the current number of districts
or other objective standard, the test loses its validity as a
threshold standard").

Respondents argue that this concern with arbitrary and
standardless intrusions into the size of local governing authority is overstated. Respondents' principal support for
this conclusion is that a five-member commission is the most
common size for Georgia. But a five-member commission is
not the only common size in Georgia: 22 Georgia counties
have three-member commissions (and one county has an 11-
member commission). Moreover, there is no good reason
why the search for benchmarks should be limited to Georgia.
Expanding the search nationwide produces many 20-person
county commissions in Tennessee, and 40-member commissions in Wisconsin. DeSantis, County Government: A Century of Change, in The Municipal Yearbook 1989, pp. 80, 83.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
In sum, respondents do not explain how common an alterna-tive practice must be before it can be a reliable alternative

benchmark for the dilution comparison, nor do they explainwhere the search for alternative benchmarks should begin
and end.

Respondents' failure to provide any meaningful principlesfor deciding future cases demonstrates the difficulty with

allowing dilution challenges to the size of a governing au-thority. Under respondents' open-ended test, a wide range
of state governmental bodies may be subject to a dilutionchallenge. Within each State there are many forms of government, including county commissions that range dramatically in size. For example, the majority of county commissions in New Jersey have seven members, but three counties
have smaller commissions and one has a larger commission.
Id., at 76. Similarly, in South Carolina the norm is a sevenmember commission, but a number of counties deviate. Id.,
at 79. In Tennessee, the average size for a county commission is 19 members, but one county has as few as 9 and another has as many as 40. Id., at 80. And in Wisconsin the
average size is 27 members, but the commission sizes range
from 7 to 46. Id., at 83.

Nor are deviations from the norm limited to counties.
Statewide governing authorities also range dramatically in
size, and often do not correlate to the size of the State. For
example, Texas has only 31 members in its State Senate,
while tiny Rhode Island has 50. Council of State Governments, State Elective Officials and the Legislatures 1993-94,
p. vi. The Texas Senate is smaller than the national average
and the Rhode Island Senate is larger. Similarly, California
has an unusually small 80-person Assembly, while New
Hampshire has a 400-person House. Ibid.

The discrepancies in size among state and local governing
authorities reinforce my concern that the limiting principle
offered by respondents will in practice limit very little.
Though respondents purport to present Bleckley County as

unique, it is not. County commissions throughout New Jer-sey, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Wisconsin, and the state

legislatures of Texas, Rhode Island, California, and NewHampshire are ripe for a dilution challenge under respondents' theory, since they do not fit the norm for their State.
Moreover, though my examples are some of the more ex-treme ones, they are not alone. In these cases, and perhaps

in many more, the potential reach of allowing dilution chal-lenges to size will not be meaningfully circumscribed by
the open-ended requirement that the alternative benchmarkbe "reasonable and workable."

Post, at 951 (Blackmun, J.,
dissenting).For these reasons, I concur in the conclusion that respondents' dilution challenge to the size of the Bleckley County
Commission cannot be maintained under $ 2 of the Voting
Rights Act, and I join Parts I, II-A, and III of Justice Kennedy's opinion. Because the Court appropriately reverses
the judgment below and remands for consideration of respondents' constitutional claim of intentional discrimination,
I also concur in the judgment.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins,
concurring in the judgment.

We are asked in this case to determine whether the size
of a local governing body is subject to challenge under $ 2
of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as a "dilutive" practice.
While I agree with Justices Kennedy and O'Connor that
the size of a governing body cannot be attacked under $ 2, I
do not share their reasons for reaching that conclusion.
Justice Kennedy persuasively demonstrates that there is
no principled method for determining a benchmark against
which the size of a governing body might be compared to
determine whether it dilutes a group's voting power. Both
he and Justice O'Connor rely on that consideration to
conclude that size cannot be challenged under $ 2 of the
Act. See ante, at 880-882, 885 (opinion of Kennedy, J.);

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
ante, at 888-891 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and con-curring in judgment).

While the practical concerns Justices Kennedy and
O'Connor point out can inform a proper construction of the
Act, I would explicitly anchor analysis in this case in the
statutory text. Only a "voting qualification or prerequisiteto voting, or standard, practice, or procedure" can be challenged under $ 2. I would hold that the size of a governingbody is not a "standard, practice, or procedure" within the
terms of the Act. In my view, however, the only principlelimiting the scope of the terms "standard, practice, or procedure" that can be derived from the text of the Act would
exclude, not only the challenge to size advanced today, but
also challenges to allegedly dilutive election methods that we
have considered within the scope of the Act in the past.

I believe that a systematic reassessment of our interpretation of $ 2 is required in this case. The broad reach we have
given the section might suggest that the size of a governing
body, like an election method that has the potential for diluting the vote of a minority group, should come within the
terms of the Act. But the gloss we have placed on the
words "standard, practice, or procedure" in cases alleging
dilution is at odds with the terms of the statute and has
proved utterly unworkable in practice. A review of the current state of our cases shows that by construing the Act to
cover potentially dilutive electoral mechanisms, we have immersed the federal courts in a hopeless project of weighing
questions of political theory--questions judges must confront
to establish a benchmark concept of an "undiluted" vote.
Worse, in pursuing the ideal measure of voting strength, we
have devised a remedial mechanism that encourages federal
courts to segregate voters into racially designated districts
to ensure minority electoral success. In doing so, we have
collaborated in what may aptly be termed the racial "balkaniz[ation]" of the Nation. Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 658
(1993).

I can no longer adhere to a reading of the Act that doesnot comport with the terms of the statute and that has

produced such a disastrous misadventure in judicial policy-making. I would hold that the size of a government body is
not a "standard, practice, or procedure" because, properlyunderstood, those terms reach only state enactments that
limit citizens' access to the ballot.

I
If one surveys the history of the Voting Rights Act, 42U. S. C. $ 1973 et seq., one can only be struck by the sea

change that has occurred in the application and enforcementof the Act since it was passed in 1965. The statute was originally perceived as a remedial provision directed specificallyat eradicating discriminatory practices that restricted
blacks' ability to register and vote in the segregated South.Now, the Act has grown into something entirely different.
In construing the Act to cover claims of vote dilution, wehave converted the Act into a device for regulating, rationing, and apportioning political power among racial and ethnicgroups. In the process, we have read the Act essentially as
a grant of authority to the federal judiciary to develop theo-ries on basic principles of representative government, for it
is only a resort to political theory that can enable a court todetermine which electoral systems provide the "fairest" levels of representation or the most "effective" or "undiluted"votes to minorities.

Before I turn to an analysis of the text of $ 2 to explainwhy, in my view, the terms of the statute do not authorize
the project that we have undertaken in the name of the Act,I intend first simply to describe the development of the basic
contours of vote dilution actions under the Voting RightsAct.

1 An examination of the current state of our decisions

1 Of course, many of the basic principles I will discuss are equally applicable to constitutional vote dilution cases. Indeed, prior to the amendment of the Voting Rights Act in 1982, dilution claims typically were

should make obvious a simple fact that for far too long hasgone unmentioned: Vote dilution cases have required the federal courts to make decisions based on highly political judg-ments--judgments that courts are inherently ill-equipped to
make. A clear understanding of the destructive assumptions that have developed to guide vote dilution decisionsand the role we have given the federal courts in redrawing

the political landscape of the Nation should make clear thepressing need for us to reassess our interpretation of the
Act. A

As it was enforced in the years immediately following its
enactment, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Pub. L. 89-110, 79
Stat. 437, was perceived primarily as legislation directed at
eliminating literacy tests and similar devices that had been
used to prevent black voter registration in the segregated
South. See A. Thernstrom, Whose Votes Count? Affirmative Action and Minority Voting Rights 17-27 (1987) (hereinafter Thernstrom). See also Guinier, The Representation of
Minority Interests: The Question of Single-Member Districts, 14 Cardozo L. Rev. 1135, 1151 (1993) (referring to actions securing access to the ballot as the "first generation"
of Voting Rights Act claims).2 This focus in enforcement
flowed, no doubt, from the emphasis on access to the ballot
apparent in the central provision of the Act, $ 4, which used
a mathematical formula based on voter registration and

brought under the Equal Protection Clause. See, e. g., White v. Regester,
412 U. S. 755 (1973); Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U. S. 124 (1971); Burns v.
Richardson, 384 U. S. 73 (1966). The early development of our voting
rights jurisprudence in those cases provided the basis for our analysis of
vote dilution under the amended $ 2 in Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S.
30 (1986).

2 Cf. L. Guinier, The Tyranny of the Majority 49, n. 58 (1994) (hereinafter

which represented the congressional response, were concerned with the
complete and total exclusion of blacks from the electoral process").

turnout in 1964 to define certain "covered" jurisdictions inwhich the use of literacy tests was immediately suspended.

Pub. L. 89-110, $ 4, 79 Stat. 438. Section 6 of the Act re-flected the same concern for registration as it provided that
federal examiners could be dispatched to covered jurisdictions whenever the Attorney General deemed it necessaryto supervise the registration of black voters. 42 U. S. C.

$ 1973d. And to prevent evasion of the requirements of $ 4,$ 5 required that covered jurisdictions obtain "preclearance"
from the Department of Justice before altering any "votingqualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice,
or procedure with respect to voting." $ 1973c.

The Act was immediately and notably successful in removing barriers to registration and ensuring access to the ballot.
For example, in Mississippi, black registration levels skyrocketed from 6.7% to 59.8% in a mere two years; in Alabama
the increase was from 19.3% to 51.6% in the same time period. See Thernstrom 18. By the end of 1967, black voter
registration had reached at least 50% in every covered State.
See B. Grofman, L. Handley, & R. Niemi, Minority Representation and the Quest for Voting Equality 22 (1992).

The Court's decision in Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393
U. S. 544 (1969), however, marked a fundamental shift in the
focal point of the Act. In an opinion dealing with four companion cases, the Allen Court determined that the Act
should be given "the broadest possible scope." Id., at 567.
Thus, in Fairley v. Patterson, the Court decided that a
covered jurisdiction's switch from a districting system to an
at-large system for election of county supervisors was a
"standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting,"
subject to preclearance under $ 5. Id., at 569. Stating that
the Act "was aimed at the subtle, as well as the obvious,
state regulations which have the effect of denying citizens
their right to vote because of their race," id., at 565, the
Court reasoned that $ 5's preclearance provisions should
apply, not only to changes in electoral laws that pertain to

registration and access to the ballot, but to provisions thatmight "dilute" the force of minority votes that were duly cast

and counted. See id., at 569. The decision in Allen thusensured that the terms "standard, practice, or procedure"
would extend to encompass a wide array of electoral practices or voting systems that might be challenged for reducingthe potential impact of minority votes.

As a consequence, Allen also ensured that courts would berequired to confront a number of complex and essentially
political questions in assessing claims of vote dilution underthe Voting Rights Act. The central difficulty in any vote
dilution case, of course, is determining a point of comparison
against which dilution can be measured. As Justice Frankfurter observed several years before Allen, "[t]alk of `debasement' or `dilution' is circular talk. One cannot speak of `debasement' or `dilution' of the value of a vote until there is
first defined a standard of reference as to what a vote should
be worth." Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 300 (1962) (dissenting opinion). See also Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30,
88 (1986) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) ("[I]n order
to decide whether an electoral system has made it harder for
minority voters to elect the candidates they prefer, a court
must have an idea in mind of how hard it `should' be for
minority voters to elect their preferred candidates under an
acceptable system"). But in setting the benchmark of what
"undiluted" or fully "effective" voting strength should be, a
court must necessarily make some judgments based purely
on an assessment of principles of political theory. As Justice
Harlan pointed out in his dissent in Allen, the Voting Rights
Act supplies no rule for a court to rely upon in deciding, for
example, whether a multimember at-large system of election
is to be preferred to a single-member district system; that is,
whether one provides a more "effective" vote than another.
"Under one system, Negroes have some influence in the election of all officers; under the other, minority groups have
more influence in the selection of fewer officers." Allen,

supra, at 586 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting inpart). The choice is inherently a political one, and depends

upon the selection of a theory for defining the fully "effec-tive" vote--at bottom, a theory for defining effective participation in representative government. In short, what

a court is actually asked to do in a vote dilution case is"to choose among competing bases of representation--ultimately, really, among competing theories of political philoso-phy."

Baker, supra, at 300 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).
Perhaps the most prominent feature of the philosophythat has emerged in vote dilution decisions since

Allen has
been the Court's preference for single-member districting
schemes, both as a benchmark for measuring undiluted minority voting strength and as a remedial mechanism for
guaranteeing minorities undiluted voting power. See, e. g.,
Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25, 40 (1993); Gingles, supra, at
50, n. 17 (declaring that the "single-member district is generally the appropriate standard against which to measure minority group potential to elect"); Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S.
55, 66, n. 12 (1980) (plurality opinion) (noting that singlemember districts should be preferred in court-ordered remedial schemes); Connor v. Finch, 431 U. S. 407, 415 (1977)
(same). Indeed, commentators surveying the history of
voting rights litigation have concluded that it has been the
objective of voting rights plaintiffs to use the Act to attack
multimember districting schemes and to replace them with
single-member districting systems drawn with majorityminority districts to ensure minority control of seats. See
Guinier, 14 Cardozo L. Rev., at 1151; Guinier 49-54; Thernstrom 193.

It should be apparent, however, that there is no principle
inherent in our constitutional system, or even in the history
of the Nation's electoral practices, that makes single-member
districts the "proper" mechanism for electing representatives to governmental bodies or for giving "undiluted" effect
to the votes of a numerical minority. On the contrary, from

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
the earliest days of the Republic, multimember districtswere a common feature of our political systems. The Framers left unanswered in the Constitution the question whethercongressional delegations from the several States should be
elected on a general ticket from each State as a whole or
under a districting scheme and left that matter to be re-solved by the States or by Congress. See U. S. Const., Art.

I, $ 4, cl. 1. It was not until 1842 that Congress determinedthat Representatives should be elected from single-member
districts in the States. See Act of June 25, 1842, ch. 47, 5Stat. 491.

3 Single-member districting was no more the rule

in the States themselves, for the Constitutions of most of the13 original States provided that representatives in the state

legislatures were to be elected from multimember districts.4Today, although they have come under increasing attack
under the Voting Rights Act, multimember district systemscontinue to be a feature on the American political landscape,
especially in municipal governments. See The Municipal
Yearbook 14 (table) (1988) (over 60% of American cities use
at-large election systems for their governing bodies).

The obvious advantage the Court has perceived in singlemember districts, of course, is their tendency to enhance the
ability of any numerical minority in the electorate to gain
control of seats in a representative body. See Gingles,
supra, at 50-51. But in choosing single-member districting
as a benchmark electoral plan on that basis the Court has
made a political decision and, indeed, a decision that itself
depends on a prior political choice made in answer to Justice
Harlan's question in Allen. Justice Harlan asked whether a

3 At that time, seven States elected their congressional delegations on
a statewide ticket. See Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U. S. 1, 8, n. 11 (1964).

group's votes should be considered to be more "effective"
when they provide influence over a greater number of seats,
or control over a lesser number of seats. See 393 U. S., at
586. In answering that query, the Court has determined
that the purpose of the vote--or of the fully "effective"
vote--is controlling seats. In other words, in an effort to
develop standards for assessing claims of dilution, the Court
has adopted the view that members of any numerically significant minority are denied a fully effective use of the franchise unless they are able to control seats in an elected body.5
Under this theory, votes that do not control a representative
are essentially wasted; those who cast them go unrepresented and are just as surely disenfranchised as if they had
been barred from registering. Cf. id., at 569 (equating denial of the ability to elect candidates with denial of the vote).
Such conclusions, of course, depend upon a certain theory of
the "effective" vote, a theory that is not inherent in the concept of representative democracy itself.6

5 See, e. g., Gingles, 478 U. S., at 88 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (noting that the Court has determined that "minority voting
strength is to be assessed solely in terms of the minority group's ability
to elect candidates it prefers") (emphasis deleted). See also Abrams,
"Raising Politics Up": Minority Political Participation and Section 2 of the
Voting Rights Act, 63 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 449, 456, n. 43, 468-471 (1988)
(criticizing the Court's "electoral focus" as a narrow conception of "political
opportunity"); Guinier 49 (arguing that since Gingles, courts "have measured black political representation and participation solely by reference to
the number and consistent election of black candidates").

6 Undoubtedly, one factor that has prompted our focus on control of seats

has been a desire, when confronted with an abstract question of political
theory concerning the measure of effective participation in government,
to seize upon an objective standard for deciding cases, however much it
may oversimplify the issues before us. If using control of seats as our
standard does not reflect a very nuanced theory of political participation,
it at least has the superficial advantage of appealing to the "most easily
measured indicia of political power." Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109,
157 (1986) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
In fact, it should be clear that the assumptions that haveguided the Court reflect only one possible understanding of

effective exercise of the franchise, an understanding basedon the view that voters are "represented" only when they
choose a delegate who will mirror their views in the legisla-tive halls. See generally H. Pitkin, The Concept of Representation 60-91 (1967).7 But it is certainly possible to con-struct a theory of effective political participation that would
accord greater importance to voters' ability to influence,rather than control, elections. And especially in a two-party
system such as ours, the influence of a potential "swing"group of voters composing 10% to 20% of the electorate in a
given district can be considerable.8 Even such a focus onpractical influence, however, is not a necessary component of
the definition of the "effective" vote. Some conceptions ofrepresentative government may primarily emphasize the
formal value of the vote as a mechanism for participation in

7 Indeed, the assumptions underpinning the Court's conclusions largely
parallel principles that John Stuart Mill advanced in proposing a system
of proportional representation as an electoral reform in Great Britain.
See J. S. Mill, Considerations on Representative Government (1861). In
Mill's view, a just system of representative government required an electoral system that ensured "a minority of the electors would always have
a minority of the representatives." Id., at 133. To Mill, a system that
allowed a portion of the population that constituted a majority in each
district to control the election of all representatives and to defeat the
minority's choice of candidates was unjust because it operated to produce
a "complete disfranchisement of minorities." Id., at 132.

8 We ourselves have tacitly acknowledged that our current view of what

constitutes an effective vote may be subject to reevaluation, or at least
that it may not provide an exclusive definition of effective voting power,
as we repeatedly have reserved the question whether a vote dilution claim
may be brought for failure to create minority "influence" districts. See,
e. g., Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146, 154 (1993) (citing cases). Cf.
Bandemer, supra, at 132 (noting that "the power to influence the political
process is not limited to winning elections"); Gingles, supra, at 99 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (suggesting that the Court should not
focus solely on a minority group's ability to elect representatives in assessing the effectiveness of the group's votes).

the electoral process, whether it results in control of a seator not. Cf.

id., at 14-59.9 Under such a theory, minorities
unable to control elected posts would not be considered es-sentially without a vote; rather, a vote duly cast and counted

would be deemed just as "effective" as any other. If a
minority group is unable to control seats, that result mayplausibly be attributed to the inescapable fact that, in a

majoritarian system, numerical minorities lose elections.10In short, there are undoubtedly an infinite number of theories of effective suffrage, representation, and the proper ap-portionment of political power in a representative democracy
that could be drawn upon to answer the questions posed in
Allen. See generally Pitkin, supra. I do not pretend to
have provided the most sophisticated account of the variouspossibilities; but such matters of political theory are beyond

the ordinary sphere of federal judges. And that is precisely
the point. The matters the Court has set out to resolve in
vote dilution cases are questions of political philosophy, not
questions of law.11 As such, they are not readily subjected

9 Cf. also Levinson, Gerrymandering and the Brooding Omnipresence of
Proportional Representation, 33 UCLA L. Rev. 257, 260-261 (1985).

10 There are traces of this view in our cases as well. See Whitcomb,

403 U. S., at 153, 155; id., at 160 ("The short of it is that we are unprepared
to hold that district-based elections decided by plurality vote are unconstitutional in either single- or multi-member districts simply because the
supporters of losing candidates have no legislative seats assigned to
them"). See also League of United Latin American Citizens v. Midland
Independent School Dist., 812 F. 2d 1494, 1507 (CA5) (Higginbotham, J.,
dissenting) ("I had supposed that the essence of our republican arrangement is that voting minorities lose"), vacated on rehearing, 829 F. 2d 546
(1987) (en banc) (per curiam).

11 The point is perhaps so widely accepted at this date that it needs little

further demonstration. See, e. g., L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law

$ 13-7, p. 1076, n. 7 (2d ed. 1988) (stating that "no strategy [in vote dilution
cases] can avoid the necessity for at least some hard substantive decisions
of political theory by the federal judiciary"); Howard & Howard, The Dilemma of the Voting Rights Act--Recognizing the Emerging Political
Equality Norm, 83 Colum. L. Rev. 1615, 1633, 1635 (1983) (hereinafter

to any judicially manageable standards that can guide courts
in attempting to select between competing theories.

But the political choices the Court has had to make do not
end with the determination that the primary purpose of the
"effective" vote is controlling seats or with the selection of
single-member districting as the mechanism for providing
that control. In one sense, these were not even the most
critical decisions to be made in devising standards for assessing claims of dilution, for, in itself, the selection of singlemember districting as a benchmark election plan will tell a
judge little about the number of minority districts to create.
Single-member districting tells a court "how" members of a
minority are to control seats, but not "how many" seats they
should be allowed to control.

But "how many" is the critical issue. Once one accepts
the proposition that the effectiveness of votes is measured
in terms of the control of seats, the core of any vote dilution
claim is an assertion that the group in question is unable to
control the "proper" number of seats--that is, the number of
seats that the minority's percentage of the population would
enable it to control in the benchmark "fair" system. The
claim is inherently based on ratios between the numbers of
the minority in the population and the numbers of seats controlled. As Justice O'Connor has noted, "any theory of
vote dilution must necessarily rely to some extent on a measure of minority voting strength that makes some reference
to the proportion between the minority group and the electorate at large." Gingles, 478 U. S., at 84 (opinion concurring in judgment). As a result, only a mathematical calculation can answer the fundamental question posed by a claim
of vote dilution. And once again, in selecting the proportion
that will be used to define the undiluted strength of a minorHoward & Howard) (arguing that the Court has developed a "substantive
theory of representative government" and a theory of "allocating political
power" in vote dilution cases).

ity--the ratio that will provide the principle for decision ina vote dilution case--a court must make a political choice.

The ratio for which this Court has opted, and thus themathematical principle driving the results in our cases, is
undoubtedly direct proportionality. Indeed, four Membersof the Court candidly recognized in

Gingles that the Courthad adopted a rule of roughly proportional representation,

at least to the extent proportionality was possible giventhe geographic dispersion of minority populations. See id.,
at 85, 91, 98-99 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).While in itself that choice may strike us intuitively as the
fairest or most just rule to apply, opting for proportionalityis still a political choice, not a result required by any principle of law. B

The dabbling in political theory that dilution cases haveprompted, however, is hardly the worst aspect of our vote
dilution jurisprudence. Far more pernicious has been theCourt's willingness to accept the one underlying premise
that must inform every minority vote dilution claim: the as-sumption that the group asserting dilution is not merely a
racial or ethnic group, but a group having distinct politicalinterests as well. Of necessity, in resolving vote dilution actions we have given credence to the view that race definespolitical interest. We have acted on the implicit assumption
that members of racial and ethnic groups must all think alikeon important matters of public policy and must have their
own "minority preferred" representatives holding seats inelected bodies if they are to be considered represented at all.

It is true that in Gingles we stated that whether a racialgroup is "politically cohesive" may not be assumed, but
rather must be proved in each case. See 478 U. S., at 51, 56.See also

Growe, 507 U. S., at 40-41. But the standards wehave employed for determining political cohesion have

proved so insubstantial that this "precondition" does notpresent much of a barrier to the assertion of vote dilution

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
claims on behalf of any racial group.12 Moreover, it provides
no test--indeed, it is not designed to provide a test--of
whether race itself determines a distinctive political community of interest. According to the rule adopted in Gingles,
plaintiffs must show simply that members of a racial group
tend to prefer the same candidates. See 478 U. S., at 61-67
(opinion of Brennan, J.). There is no set standard defining
how strong the correlation must be, and an inquiry into the
cause for the correlation (to determine, for example, whether
it might be the product of similar socioeconomic interests
rather than some other factor related to race) is unnecessary.
Ibid. See also id., at 100 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).13 Thus, whenever similarities in political preferences
along racial lines exist, we proclaim that the cause of the
correlation is irrelevant, but we effectively rely on the fact
of the correlation to assume that racial groups have unique
political interests.

12 Cf. Citizens for a Better Gretna v. Gretna, 834 F. 2d 496, 501-502 (CA5
1987) (emphasizing that political cohesion under Gingles can be shown
where a "significant number" of minority voters prefer the same candidate, and suggesting that data showing that anywhere from 49% to 67% of
the members of a minority group preferred the same candidate established
cohesion), cert. denied, 492 U. S. 905 (1989).

13 Justice O'Connor agreed with Justice Brennan in Gingles that, insofar as determining political cohesion was concerned, the cause for a correlation between race and candidate preference was irrelevant. She maintained, however, that evidence of the cause of the correlation would still
be relevant to the overall vote dilution inquiry and particularly to the
question whether a white majority will usually vote to defeat the minority's preferred candidate. See 478 U. S., at 100 (opinion concurring in judgment). The splintering of opinions in Gingles on this point has produced,
at best, "uncertainty," Overton v. Austin, 871 F. 2d 529, 538 (CA5 1989),
and has allowed bivariate regression analysis--that is, an analysis that
measures merely the correlation between race and candidate preference
and that does not directly control for other factors--to become the norm
for determining cohesion in vote dilution cases. See id., at 539. But cf.
League of United Latin American Citizens v. Clements, 999 F. 2d 831,

As a result, Gingles' requirement of proof of political cohe-siveness, as practically applied, has proved little different

from a working assumption that racial groups can be con-ceived of largely as political interest groups. And operating
under that assumption, we have assigned federal courts the
task of ensuring that minorities are assured their "just"share of seats in elected bodies throughout the Nation.

To achieve that result through the currently fashionablemechanism of drawing majority-minority single-member districts, we have embarked upon what has been aptly charac-terized as a process of "creating racially `safe boroughs.' "
United States v. Dallas County Comm'n, 850 F. 2d 1433, 1444
(CA11 1988) (Hill, J., concurring specially), cert. denied, 490
U. S. 1030 (1989). We have involved the federal courts, and
indeed the Nation, in the enterprise of systematically dividing the country into electoral districts along racial lines--an
enterprise of segregating the races into political homelands
that amounts, in truth, to nothing short of a system of "political apartheid." Shaw, 509 U. S., at 647. See also id., at 657
(noting that racial gerrymandering "may balkanize us into
competing racial factions"). Blacks are drawn into "black
districts" and given "black representatives"; Hispanics are
drawn into Hispanic districts and given "Hispanic representatives"; and so on. Worse still, it is not only the courts
that have taken up this project. In response to judicial decisions and the promptings of the Justice Department, the
States themselves, in an attempt to avoid costly and disruptive Voting Rights Act litigation, have begun to gerrymander
electoral districts according to race. That practice now
promises to embroil the courts in a lengthy process of attempting to undo, or at least to minimize, the damage
wrought by the system we created. See, e. g., Shaw, supra;
Hays v. Louisiana, 839 F. Supp. 1188 (WD La. 1993), appeal
pending, No. 93-1539.

have been based should be repugnant to any nation that

strives for the ideal of a color-blind Constitution. "Theprinciple of equality is at war with the notion that District

A must be represented by a Negro, as it is with the notionthat District B must be represented by a Caucasian, District
C by a Jew, District D by a Catholic, and so on." Wright v.
Rockefeller, 376 U. S. 52, 66 (1964) (Douglas, J., dissenting).Despite Justice Douglas' warning sounded 30 years ago, our

voting rights decisions are rapidly progressing toward a sys-tem that is indistinguishable in principle from a scheme
under which members of different racial groups are dividedinto separate electoral registers and allocated a proportion
of political power on the basis of race. Cf. id., at 63-66.
Under our jurisprudence, rather than requiring registrationon racial rolls and dividing power purely on a population

basis, we have simply resorted to the somewhat less preciseexpedient of drawing geographic district lines to capture minority populations and to ensure the existence of the "appro-priate" number of "safe minority seats."

That distinction in the practical implementation of the con-cept, of course, is immaterial.

14 The basic premises underlying our system of safe minority districts and those behindthe racial register are the same: that members of the racial

group must think alike and that their interests are so distinctthat the group must be provided a separate body of representatives in the legislature to voice its unique point of view.Such a "system, by whatever name it is called, is a divisive
force in a community, emphasizing differences between candidates and voters that are irrelevant." Id., at 66. JusticeDouglas correctly predicted the results of state sponsorship

of such a theory of representation: "When racial or religious

lines are drawn by the State, . . . antagonisms that relate torace or to religion rather than to political issues are generated; communities seek not the best representative but thebest racial or religious partisan."

Id., at 67. In short, few
devices could be better designed to exacerbate racial tensions than the consciously segregated districting system cur-rently being constructed in the name of the Voting Rights

Act.As a practical political matter, our drive to segregate political districts by race can only serve to deepen racial divisionsby destroying any need for voters or candidates to build
bridges between racial groups or to form voting coalitions.
"Black-preferred" candidates are assured election in "safe
black districts"; white-preferred candidates are assured election in "safe white districts." Neither group needs to draw
on support from the other's constituency to win on election
day. As one judge described the current trend of voting
rights cases: "We are bent upon polarizing political subdivisions by race. The arrangement we construct makes it unnecessary, and probably unwise, for an elected official from a
white majority district to be responsive at all to the wishes
of black citizens; similarly, it is politically unwise for a black
official from a black majority district to be responsive at all
to white citizens." Dallas County Comm'n, 850 F. 2d, at
1444 (Hill, J., concurring specially).

As this description suggests, the system we have instituted affirmatively encourages a racially based understanding of the representative function. The clear premise of the
system is that geographic districts are merely a device to be
manipulated to establish "black representatives" whose real
constituencies are defined, not in terms of the voters who
populate their districts, but in terms of race. The "black
representative's" function, in other words, is to represent the
"black interest." Cf. Shaw, 509 U. S., at 650 (recognizing
that systems that "classify and separate voters by race"

racy by signaling to elected officials that they represent aparticular racial group rather than their constituency as a

whole").Perhaps not surprisingly, the United States has now
adopted precisely this theory of racial group representation,as the arguments advanced in another case decided today,
Johnson v. De Grandy, post, p. 997, should show. The caseinvolved a claim that an apportionment plan for the Florida
Legislature should have provided another Hispanic districtin Dade County. Florida responded to the claim of vote dilution by arguing that the plan already provided DadeCounty Hispanics with seats in proportion to their numbers.
According to the Solicitor General, this claim of proportional-ity should have been evaluated, not merely on the basis of
the population in the Dade County area where the racial ger-rymandering was alleged to have occurred, but on a statewide basis. It did not matter, in the Solicitor General'sview, that Hispanic populations elsewhere in the State could
not meet the Gingles geographic compactness test, see 478U. S., at 50, and thus could not possibly have controlled districts of their own. After all, the Solicitor General rea-soned, the Hispanic legislators elected from Hispanic districts in Dade County would represent, not just the interestsof the Dade County Hispanics, but the interests of all the
Hispanics in the State. Brief for United States in Johnsonv.

De Grandy, O. T. 1993, No. 92-519, p. 20. As the argu-ment shows, at least some careful observers have recognized

the racial gerrymandering in our vote dilution cases for whatit is: a slightly less precise mechanism than the racial register for allocating representation on the basis of race.

rework electoral systems under our Voting Rights Act jurisprudence. On the contrary, in relying on single-member districting schemes as a touchstone, our cases so far have been
somewhat arbitrarily limited to addressing the interests of
minority voters who are sufficiently geographically compact
to form a majority in a single-member district. See Gingles,
supra, at 49-50. There is no reason a priori, however, that
our focus should be so constrained. The decision to rely on
single-member geographic districts as a mechanism for conducting elections is merely a political choice--and one that
we might reconsider in the future. Indeed, it is a choice that
has undoubtedly been influenced by the adversary process:
In the cases that have come before us, plaintiffs have focused
largely upon attacking multimember districts and have offered single-member schemes as the benchmark of an "undiluted" alternative.

But as the destructive effects of our current penchant for
majority-minority districts become more apparent, cf. Shaw,
supra, courts will undoubtedly be called upon to reconsider
adherence to geographic districting as a method for ensuring
minority voting power. Already, some advocates have criticized the current strategy of creating majority-minority districts and have urged the adoption of other voting mechanisms--for example, cumulative voting 15 or a system using

15 Under a cumulative voting scheme, a system commonly used in corporations to protect the interests of minority shareholders, see R. Clark,
Corporate Law $ 9.1.3, pp. 361-366 (1986), each voter has as many votes
as there are posts to be filled, and the voter may cast as many of his votes
as he wishes for a single candidate. The system thus allows a numerical
minority to concentrate its voting power behind a given candidate without
requiring that the minority voters themselves be concentrated into a single district. For a complete description of the mechanics of cumulative
voting, see Zimmerman, The Federal Voting Rights Act and Alternative
Election Systems, 19 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 621, 654-657 (1978).

transferable votes 16--that can produce proportional resultswithout requiring division of the electorate into racially segregated districts. Cf., e. g., Guinier 14-15, 94-101; How-ard & Howard 1660; Karlan, Maps and Misreadings: The Role
of Geographic Compactness in Racial Vote Dilution Litiga-tion, 24 Harv. Civ. Rights-Civ. Lib. L. Rev. 173, 174-175, 231-

Rights Act, 92 Colum. L. Rev. 1810, 1857-1865 (1992).Such changes may seem radical departures from the electoral systems with which we are most familiar. Indeed,they may be unwanted by the people in the several States
who purposely have adopted districting systems in theirelectoral laws. But nothing in our present understanding of
the Voting Rights Act places a principled limit on the author-ity of federal courts that would prevent them from instituting a system of cumulative voting as a remedy under $ 2,or even from establishing a more elaborate mechanism for
securing proportional representation based on transferablevotes.

17 As some Members of the Court have already recog16 A system utilizing transferable votes is designed to ensure proportional representation with "mathematical exactness." Id., at 640. Under
such a system, each voter rank orders his choices of candidates. To win,
a candidate must receive a fixed quota of votes, which may be set by any
of several methods. Ballots listing a given candidate as the voter's first
choice are counted for that candidate until the candidate has secured the
quota of votes necessary for election. Remaining first-choice ballots for
that candidate are then transferred to another candidate, usually the one
listed as the second choice on the ballot. See id., at 640-642. Like cumulative voting, the system allows a minority group to concentrate its voting
power without requiring districting, and it has the additional advantage
of ensuring that "surplus" votes are transferred to support the election of
the minority voters' next preference.

17 Such methods of voting cannot be rejected out-of-hand as bizarre concoctions of Voting Rights Act plaintiffs. The system of transferable votes
was a widely celebrated, although unsuccessful, proposal for English par512us3$94n 01-08-98 12:46:52 PAGES OPINPGT

nized, geographic districting is not a requirement inherentin our political system. See, e. g., Davis v. Bandemer, 478

U. S. 109, 159 (1986) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment)("Districting itself represents a middle ground between
winner-take-all statewide elections and proportional repre-sentation for political parties");

id., at 160 (noting that ourcurrent practice of accepting district-based elections as a

given is simply a "political judgment"). Rather, districtingis merely another political choice made by the citizenry in
the drafting of their state constitutions. Like other politicalchoices concerning electoral systems and models of representation, it too is presumably subject to a judicial override ifit comes into conflict with the theories of representation
and effective voting that we may develop under the VotingRights Act.

Indeed, the unvarnished truth is that all that is requiredfor districting to fall out of favor is for Members of this Court
to further develop their political thinking. We should notbe surprised if voting rights advocates encourage us to "revive our political imagination," Guinier, 14 Cardozo L. Rev.,at 1137, and to consider "innovative and nontraditional remedies" for vote dilution, Karlan 221, for under our VotingRights Act jurisprudence, it is only the limits on our "political imagination" that place restraints on the standards wemay select for defining undiluted voting systems. Once we
candidly recognize that geographic districting and other as-pects of electoral systems that we have so far placed beyond
question are merely political choices, those practices, too,
liamentary reform in the last century. See generally T. Hare, Election of
Representatives (4th ed. 1873); J. S. Mill, Considerations on Representative Government (1861). And while it is an oddity in American political
history, cumulative voting in an at-large system has been employed in
some American jurisdictions. See Weaver, Semi-Proportional and Proportional Representation Systems in the United States, in Choosing an
Electoral System 191, 198 (A. Lijphart & B. Grofman eds. 1984); Hyneman & Morgan, Cumulative Voting in Illinois, 32 Ill. L. Rev. 12 (1937).

may fall under suspicion of having a dilutive effect on minor-ity voting strength. And when the time comes to put the

question to the test, it may be difficult indeed for a Courtthat, under Gingles, has been bent on creating roughly proportional representation for geographically compact minori-ties to find a principled reason for holding that a geographically dispersed minority cannot challenge districting itself asa dilutive electoral practice. In principle, cumulative voting
and other non-district-based methods of effecting propor-tional representation are simply more efficient and straightforward mechanisms for achieving what has already becomeour tacit objective: roughly proportional allocation of political power according to race.At least one court, in fact, has already abandoned districting and has opted instead for cumulative voting on a county-wide basis as a remedy for a Voting Rights Act violation.
The District Court for the District of Maryland recently rea-soned that, compared to a system that divides voters into
districts according to race, "[c]umulative voting is less likelyto increase polarization between different interests," and
that it "will allow the voters, by the way they exercise theirvotes, to `district' themselves," thereby avoiding government
involvement in a process of segregating the electorate.
Cane v. Worcester County, 847 F. Supp. 369, 373 (1994).Cf. Guinier, 14 Cardozo L. Rev., at 1135-1136 (proposing a

similar analysis of the benefits of cumulative voting); Karlan236 (same). If such a system can be ordered on a countywide basis, we should recognize that there is no limitingprinciple under the Act that would prevent federal courts
from requiring it for elections to state legislatures as well.

Such is the current state of our understanding of the Vot-ing Rights Act. That our reading of the Act has assigned

the federal judiciary the task of making the decisions I havedescribed above should suggest to the Members of this Court

that something in our jurisprudence has gone awry.18 We
would be mighty Platonic guardians indeed if Congress had
granted us the authority to determine the best form of local
government for every county, city, village, and town in
America. But under our constitutional system, this Court
is not a centralized politburo appointed for life to dictate to
the provinces the "correct" theories of democratic representation, the "best" electoral systems for securing truly "representative" government, the "fairest" proportions of minority political influence, or, as respondents would have us hold
today, the "proper" sizes for local governing bodies. We
should be cautious in interpreting any Act of Congress to
grant us power to make such determinations.

Justice Blackmun suggests that, if we were to interpret
the Act to allow challenges to the size of governmental bodies under $ 2, the Court's power to determine the structure
that local governing bodies must take would be bounded by
the constraints that local customs provide in the form of
benchmarks. Post, at 952-953. But as Justice O'Connor
rightly points out, such benchmarks are themselves arbitrarily selected and would provide no assured limits on judicial power. Ante, at 888-891. In my view, the local standards to which Justice Blackmun points today are little
different from the various standards to which the Court has
resorted in the past as touchstones of undiluted voting systems. The appeal to such standards, which are necessarily
arbitrarily chosen, should not serve to obscure the assumption in the Court's vote dilution jurisprudence of a sweeping

18 Justice Stevens suggests that the discussion above outlines policy
arguments best addressed to Congress. See post, at 957. In one sense,
that is precisely my point. The issues I have discussed above involve
policy decisions that are matters best left to Congress. Our interpretation of the Voting Rights Act, however, has required federal courts to take
over the policymaking role in the area of voting rights and has forced
judges to make decisions on matters beyond the normal sphere of judicial competence.

authority to select the electoral systems to be used by everygoverning body in each of the 50 States, and to do so based

upon little more than the passing preference of five Membersof this Court for one political theory over another.

A full understanding of the authority that our current in-terpretation of the Voting Rights Act assigns to the federal
courts, and of the destructive effects that our exercise of thatauthority is presently having upon our body politic, compels
a single conclusion: A systematic reexamination of our inter-pretation of the Act is required.

II
Section 2(a) of the Voting Rights Act provides that "[n]ovoting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard,

practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by anyState or political subdivision in a manner which results in a
denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of theUnited States to vote" on account of race, color, or membership in one of the language minority groups defined in theAct. 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(a). Respondents contend that the
terms "standard, practice, or procedure" should extend tocover the size of a governmental body. An examination of
the text of $ 2 makes it clear, however, that the terms of theAct do not reach that far; indeed, the terms of the Act do
not allow many of the challenges to electoral mechanismsthat we have permitted in the past. Properly understood,
the terms "standard, practice, or procedure" in $ 2(a) referonly to practices that affect minority citizens' access to
the ballot. Districting systems and electoral mechanismsthat may affect the "weight" given to a ballot duly cast and
counted are simply beyond the purview of the Act.

A
In determining the scope of $ 2(a), as when interpretingany statute, we should begin with the statutory language.

See Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253-

512us3$94n 01-08-98 12:46:52 PAGES OPINPGT

915Cite as: 512 U. S. 874 (1994)
Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
254 (1992). Under the plain terms of the Act, $ 2(a) coversonly a defined category of state actions. Only "voting qualification[s]," "prerequisite[s] to voting," or "standard[s], prac-tice[s], or procedure[s]" are subject to challenge under the
Act. The first two items in this list clearly refer to conditions or tests applied to regulate citizens' access to the ballot.They would cover, for example, any form of test or requirement imposed as a condition on registration or on the processof voting on election day.

Taken in isolation, the last grouping of terms--"standard,practice, or procedure"--may seem somewhat less precise.
If we give the words their ordinary meanings, however--for
they have no technical significance and are not defined in the
Act--they would not normally be understood to include the
size of a local governing body. Common sense indicates that
the size of a governing body and other aspects of government
structure do not comfortably fit within the terms "standard,
practice, or procedure." Moreover, we need not simply
treat the terms in isolation; indeed, it would be a mistake to
do so. Cf. United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood
Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988). Reading
the words in context strongly suggests that $ 2(a) must be
understood as referring to any standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting. And thus understood, the
terms of the section would not extend to the size of a governmental body; we would not usually describe the size or
form of a governing authority as a "practice" or "procedure"
concerning voting.

But under our precedents, we have already stretched the
terms "standard, practice, or procedure" beyond the limits
of ordinary meaning. We have concluded, for example, that
the choice of a certain set of district lines is a "procedure," or
perhaps a "practice," concerning voting subject to challenge
under the Act, see Growe, 507 U. S., at 40-41, even though
the drawing of a given set of district lines has nothing to do
with the basic process of allowing a citizen to vote--that is,

512us3$94n 01-08-98 12:46:52 PAGES OPINPGT
916 HOLDER v. HALL

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
the process of registering, casting a ballot, and having it
counted. Similarly, we have determined that the use of
multimember districts, rather than single-member districts,
can be challenged under the Act. See Gingles, 478 U. S., at
46-51. Undoubtedly, one of the critical reasons we have
read $ 2 to reach such districting decisions is that the choice
of one districting system over another can affect a minority
group's power to control seats in the elected body. See ibid.
In that respect, however, the districting practices we have
treated as subject to challenge under the Act are essentially
similar to choices concerning the size of a governing authority. Just as drawing district lines one way rather than another, or using one type of districting system rather than
another, can affect the ability of a minority group to control
seats, so can restricting the number of seats that are available. And if how districts are drawn is a "practice" concerning voting, why not conclude that how many districts are
drawn is a "practice" as well?

To be sure, a distinction can be made between the size of
a local governing body and a districting mechanism. After
all, we would ordinarily think that the size of a government
has greater independent significance for the functioning of
the governmental body than the choice of districting systems
apportioning representation. Interfering with the form of
government, therefore, might appear to involve a greater intrusion on state sovereignty. But such distinctions between
the size of a governing body and other potential "voting
practices" do not, at bottom, depend upon how closely each
is related to "voting," and thus they are not rooted in any
way in the text of $ 2(a). On the contrary, while it may seem
obvious that the size of a government is not within the reach
of the Act, if we look to the text of the statute for the limiting
principle that confines the terms "standard, practice, or procedure" and excludes government size from their reach, we
must conclude that the only line drawn in $ 2 excludes many

917Cite as: 512 U. S. 874 (1994)
Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
"practices" that we have already decided are subject to chal-lenge under the Act.

If we return to the Act to reexamine the terms setting outthe actions regulated by $ 2, a careful reading of the statutory text will reveal a good deal more about the limitationson the scope of the section than suggested above. The
terms "standard, practice, or procedure" appear to have beenincluded in $ 2 as a sort of catchall provision. They seem
phrased with an eye to eliminating the possibility of eva-sion.

19 Nevertheless, they are catchall terms that round out

a list, and a sensible and long-established maxim of construction limits the way we should understand such general wordsappended to an enumeration of more specific items. The

principle of ejusdem generis suggests that such generalterms should be understood to refer to items belonging to
the same class that is defined by the more specific terms in
the list. See, e. g., Cleveland v. United States, 329 U. S. 14,18 (1946).

Here, the specific items described in $ 2(a) ("voting qualifi-cation[s]" and "prerequisite[s] to voting") indicate that Congress was concerned in this section with any procedure, how-ever it might be denominated, that regulates citizens' access
to the ballot--that is, any procedure that might erect a bar-rier to prevent the potential voter from casting his vote. In
describing the laws that would be subject to $ 2, Congress
focused attention upon provisions regulating the interactionbetween the individual voter and the voting process--on

hurdles the citizen might have to cross in the form of "pre-requisites" or "qualifications." The general terms in the
section are most naturally understood, therefore, to refer to

19 Cf. South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 335 (1966) (noting
that "Congress knew that some of the States . . . had resorted to the
extraordinary stratagem of contriving new rules of various kinds for the
sole purpose of perpetuating voting discrimination in the face of adverse
federal court decrees" and that "Congress had reason to suppose that
these States might try similar maneuvers in the future").

512us3$94n 01-08-98 12:46:52 PAGES OPINPGT

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
any methods for conducting a part of the voting process thatmight similarly be used to interfere with a citizen's ability

to cast his vote, and they are undoubtedly intended to ensurethat the entire voting process--a process that begins with
registration and includes the casting of a ballot and having
the ballot counted--is covered by the Act. Cf. infra, at 919-920. Simply by including general terms in $ 2(a) to ensure

the efficacy of the restriction imposed, Congress should notbe understood to have expanded the scope of the restriction
beyond the logical limits implied in the specific terms of thestatute. Cf.

Cleveland, supra, at 18 ("Under the ejusdem
generis rule of construction the general words are confined
to the class and may not be used to enlarge it").

Moreover, it is not only in the terms describing the practices regulated under the Act that $ 2(a) focuses on the individual voter. The section also speaks only in the singular
of the right of "any citizen" to vote. Giving the terms
"standard, practice, or procedure" an expansive interpretation to reach potentially dilutive practices, however, would
distort that focus on the individual, for a vote dilution claim
necessarily depends on the assertion of a group right. Cf.
Bandemer, 478 U. S., at 150-151 (O'Connor, J., concurring
in judgment). At the heart of the claim is the contention
that the members of a group collectively have been unable
to exert the influence that their numbers suggest they might
under an alternative system. Such a group right, however,
finds no grounding in the terms of $ 2(a).

Of course, the scope of the right that is protected under
the Act can provide further guidance concerning the meaning of the terms "standard, practice, or procedure." Under
the terms of the Act, only a "standard, practice, or procedure" that may result in the "denial or abridgement of the
right . . . to vote" is within the reach of $ 2(a). But nothing
in the language used in $ 2(a) to describe the protection provided by the Act suggests that in protecting the "right to
vote," the section was meant to incorporate a concept of vot512us3$94n 01-08-98 12:46:53 PAGES OPINPGT

919Cite as: 512 U. S. 874 (1994)
Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
ing that encompasses a concern for the "weight" or "influ-ence" of votes. On the contrary, the definition of the terms

"vote" and "voting" in $ 14(c)(1) of the Act focuses preciselyon access to the ballot. Thus, $ 14(c)(1) provides that the
terms "vote" and "voting" shall encompass any measures
necessary to ensure "registration" and any "other action re-quired by law prerequisite to voting, casting a ballot, and

having such ballot counted properly and included in the ap-propriate totals of votes cast." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973

l(c)(1).
It is true that $ 14(c)(1) also states that the term "voting""include[s] all action necessary to make a vote

effective,"
ibid. (emphasis added), and the Court has seized on this language as an indication that Congress intended the Act to
reach claims of vote dilution. See Allen, 393 U. S., at 566.
But if the word "effective" is not plucked out of context, the
rest of $ 14(c)(1) makes clear that the actions Congress
deemed necessary to make a vote "effective" were precisely
the actions listed above: registering, satisfying other voting
prerequisites, casting a ballot, and having it included in the
final tally of votes cast. These actions are described in the
section only as examples of the steps necessary to make a
vote effective. See 42 U. S. C. $ 1973l(c)(1). And while the
list of such actions is not exclusive, the nature of all the examples that are provided demonstrates that as far as the Act
is concerned, an "effective" vote is merely one that has been
cast and fairly counted. See 393 U. S., at 590, n. 7 (Harlan,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).

Reading the Act's prohibition of practices that may result
in a "denial or abridgement of the right . . . to vote" as protecting only access to the ballot also yields an interpretation
that is consistent with the Court's construction of virtually
identical language in the Fifteenth Amendment. The use of
language taken from the Amendment suggests that the section was intended to protect a "right to vote" with the same
scope as the right secured by the Amendment itself; certainly, no reason appears from the text of the Act for giving

512us3$94n 01-08-98 12:46:53 PAGES OPINPGT
920 HOLDER v. HALL

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
the language a broader construction in the statute than wehave given it in the Constitution. The Court has never decided, however, whether the Fifteenth Amendment shouldbe understood to protect against vote "dilution." See

Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146, 159 (1993). See also Beer v.
United States, 425 U. S. 130, 142, n. 14 (1976) (noting thatthere is no decision of this Court holding a legislative apportionment plan violative of the Fifteenth Amendment).20While the terms of $ 2(a) thus indicate that the section
focuses only on securing access to the ballot, it might be ar-gued that reenactment of $ 2 in 1982 should be understood
as an endorsement of the interpretation contained in casessuch as

Allen that the terms "standard, practice, or procedure" were meant to reach potentially dilutive practices.See

Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 580-581 (1978). It is
true that we generally will assume that reenactment of specific statutory language is intended to include a "settled judicial interpretation" of that language. Pierce v. Underwood,
487 U. S. 552, 567 (1988). And while $ 2 was amended in

20 Indeed, in Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S. 55 (1980), a plurality of the
Court concluded that the Fifteenth Amendment did not address concerns
of dilution at all. See id., at 65. Cf. id., at 84, n. 3 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment) (noting that the plurality had concluded that the Fifteenth Amendment "applies only to practices that directly affect access to
the ballot and hence is totally inapplicable to the case at bar").

Contrary to Justice Stevens' suggestions, post, at 958, 962, Gomillion
v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339 (1960), does not indicate that the Fifteenth
Amendment, in protecting the right to vote, incorporates a concern for
anything beyond securing access to the ballot. The Gomillion plaintiffs'
claims centered precisely on access: Their complaint was not that the
weight of their votes had been diminished in some way, but that the boundaries of a city had been drawn to prevent blacks from voting in municipal
elections altogether. Id., at 341. Gomillion thus "maintains the distinction between an attempt to exclude Negroes totally from the relevant
constituency, and a statute that permits Negroes to vote but which uses
the gerrymander to contain the impact of Negro suffrage." Allen v. State
Bd. of Elections, 393 U. S. 544, 589 (1969) (Harlan, J., concurring in part

1982, the amended section did retain the same language thathad appeared in the original Act regulating "standard[s],

practice[s], or procedure[s]." 21 But it was hardly well set-tled in 1982 that Allen's broad reading of the terms "standard, practice, or procedure" in $ 5 would set the scope of $ 2as a provision reaching claims of vote dilution.

On the contrary, in 1980 in Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S.55, a plurality of the Court construed $ 2 in a manner flatly
inconsistent with the understanding that those terms weremeant to reach dilutive practices. Emphasizing that the
section tracked the language of the Fifteenth Amendmentby prohibiting the use of practices that might "deny or
abridge the right . . . to vote," the Bolden plurality deter-mined that $ 2 was "intended to have an effect no different

from that of the Fifteenth Amendment itself." Id., at 61.In the plurality's view, however, the Fifteenth Amendment
did not extend to reach dilution claims; its protections weresatisfied as long as members of racial minorities could " `register and vote without hindrance.' " Id., at 65. Bolden re-mained the last word from this Court interpreting $ 2 at the
time the section was amended in 1982. Cf. Rogers v. Lodge,458 U. S. 613, 619, n. 6 (1982). Thus, the reenactment in the
amended section of the same language covering any "stand-ard, practice, or procedure" and the retention of virtually
identical language protecting against the "denial or abridge-ment of the right . . . to vote" can hardly be understood as an
endorsement of a broad reading of the section as a provisionreaching claims of vote dilution.

22 If anything, applying the Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575 (1978), principle of construction might suggest that, by reenacting virtually the same
language derived from the Fifteenth Amendment to define the basic interest protected by the Act, Congress intended to preserve the limitation
that the Bolden plurality found implicit in that language. It is clear from
the terms of the amendments passed in 1982 that where Congress sought

Finally, as our cases have shown, reading $ 2(a) to reachbeyond laws that regulate in some way citizens' access to the

ballot turns the section into a command for courts to evalu-ate abstract principles of political theory in order to develop rules for deciding which votes are "diluted" and whichare not. See generally

supra, at 894-903. Common sensewould suggest that we should not lightly interpret the Act

to require courts to address such matters so far outside thenormal bounds of judicial competence, and the mere use of
three more general terms at the end of the list of regulatedpractices in $ 2(a) cannot properly be understood to incorporate such an expansive command into the Act.Properly understood, therefore, $ 2(a) is a provision designed to protect access to the ballot, and in regulating"standard[s], practice[s], and procedure[s]," it reaches only
"those state laws that [relate to] either voter qualificationsor the manner in which elections are conducted."

in part). The section thus covers all manner of registrationrequirements, the practices surrounding registration (including the selection of times and places where registration takesplace and the selection of registrars), the locations of polling
places, the times polls are open, the use of paper ballots asopposed to voting machines, and other similar aspects of the
voting process that might be manipulated to deny any citizenthe right to cast a ballot and have it properly counted. The

the 1982 amendments modified $ 2 to eliminate the requirement under
Bolden that $ 2 plaintiffs, like plaintiffs under the Fifteenth Amendment,
show that a challenged practice was adopted with a discriminatory intent,
see 446 U. S., at 62-63, and replaced that test with specific language in

$ 2(b) setting a standard based simply on discriminatory results. See Pub.
L. 97-205, $ 3, 96 Stat. 134. Had Congress intended to alter the understanding that $ 2 protects a concept of the "right to vote" that does not
extend to prohibit vote dilution, it likely would have addressed that aspect
of Bolden explicitly as well.

section does not cover, however, the choice of a multimemberover a single-member districting system or the selection of

one set of districting lines over another, or any other suchelectoral mechanism or method of election that might reduce
the weight or influence a ballot may have in controlling the
outcome of an election.Of course, this interpretation of the terms "standard, practice, or procedure" effectively means that $ 2(a) does not pro-vide for any claims of what we have called vote "dilution."
But that is precisely the result suggested by the text of thestatute. Section 2(a) nowhere uses the term "vote dilution"
or suggests that its goal is to ensure that votes are given
their proper "weight." And an examination of $ 2(b) does
not suggest any different result. It is true that in construing $ 2 to reach vote dilution claims in Thornburg v. Gingles,
478 U. S. 30 (1986), the Court relied largely on the gloss on

$ 2(b) supplied in the legislative history of the 1982 amendments to the Act. See id., at 43-46. But the text of $ 2(b)
supplies a weak foundation indeed for reading the Act to
reach such claims.

As the Court concluded in Gingles, the 1982 amendments
incorporated into the Act, and specifically into $ 2(b), a "results" test for measuring violations of $ 2(a). That test was
intended to replace, for $ 2 purposes, the "intent" test the
Court had announced in Bolden for voting rights claims
under $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act and under the Fourteenth
and Fifteenth Amendments. Section 2(a) thus prohibits
certain state actions that may "resul[t] in a denial or abridgement" of the right to vote, and $ 2(b) incorporates virtually
the exact language of the "results test" employed by the
Court in White v. Regester, 412 U. S. 755 (1973), and applied
in constitutional voting rights cases before our decision in
Bolden. The section directs courts to consider whether
"based on the totality of circumstances," a state practice results in members of a minority group "hav[ing] less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in

the political process and to elect representatives of theirchoice." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(b). Cf.

White, supra, at 766;
Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U. S. 124, 149 (1971).But the mere adoption of a "results" test, rather than an

"intent" test, says nothing about the type of state laws that
may be challenged using that test. On the contrary, thetype of state law that may be challenged under $ 2 is addressed explicitly in $ 2(a). As we noted in Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U. S. 380 (1991), $$ 2(a) and (b) address distinct issues. While $ 2(a) defines and explicitly limits the type ofvoting practice that may be challenged under the Act, $ 2(b)

provides only "the test for determining the legality of such
a practice." Id., at 391. Thus, as an initial matter, there is
no reason to think that $ 2(b) could serve to expand the scope
of the prohibition in $ 2(a), which, as I described above, does
not extend by its terms to electoral mechanisms that might
have a dilutive effect on group voting power.

Even putting that concern aside for the moment, it should
be apparent that the incorporation of a results test into the
amended section does not necessarily suggest that Congress
intended to allow claims of vote dilution under $ 2. A results test is useful to plaintiffs whether they are challenging
laws that restrict access to the ballot or laws that accomplish
some diminution in the "proper weight" of a group's vote.
Nothing about the test itself suggests that it is inherently
tied to vote dilution claims. A law, for example, limiting the
times and places at which registration can occur might be
adopted with the purpose of limiting black voter registration, but it could be extremely difficult to prove the discriminatory intent behind such a facially neutral law. The results
test would allow plaintiffs to mount a successful challenge to
the law under $ 2 without such proof.

Moreover, nothing in the language $ 2(b) uses to describe
the results test particularly indicates that the test was intended to be used under the Act for assessing claims of dilution. Section 2(b) directs courts to consider whether, under

the "totality of circumstances," members of a minority group"have less opportunity than other members of the electorate

to participate in the political process and to elect representa-tives of their choice." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(b). The most natural reading of that language would suggest that citizens havean equal "

opportunity" to participate in the electoral processand an equal "opportunity" to elect representatives when

they have been given the same free and open access to theballot as other citizens and their votes have been properly
counted. The section speaks in terms of an opportunity--achance--to participate and to elect, not an assured ability to
attain any particular result. And since the ballot providesthe formal mechanism for obtaining access to the political
process and for electing representatives, it would seem thatone who has had the same chance as others to register and
to cast his ballot has had an equal opportunity to participateand to elect, whether or not any of the candidates he chooses
is ultimately successful.To be sure, the test in $ 2(b) could be read to apply to
claims of vote dilution as well. But to conclude, for example,that a multimember districting system had denied a group
of voters an equal opportunity to participate in the politicalprocess and to elect representatives, a court would have to
embark on the extended project in political theory that Idescribed above in Part I of this opinion. In other words, a
court would have to develop some theory of the benchmarkundiluted voting system that provides minorities with the
"fairest" or most "equitable" share of political influence. Un-doubtedly, a dizzying array of concepts of political equality
might be described to aid in that task, and each could be usedto attribute different values to different systems of election.
See, e. g., Still, Political Equality and Election Systems, 91Ethics 375 (1981).

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
mine whether members of a minority have had an equal"opportunity . . . to participate in the political process and

to elect representatives" provides no guidance concerningwhich one of the possible standards setting undiluted voting
strength should be chosen over the others. And it would becontrary to common sense to read $ 2(b)'s reference to equal
opportunity as a charter for federal courts to embark on theambitious project of developing a theory of political equality
to be imposed on the Nation.24It is true that one factor courts may consider under the
results test might fit more comfortably with an interpreta-tion of the Act that reaches vote dilution claims. Section
2(b) provides that "one circumstance" that may be consideredin assessing the results test is the "extent to which members
of a protected class have been elected to office." 42 U. S. C.$ 1973(b). Obviously, electoral outcomes would be relevant
to claims of vote dilution (assuming, of course, that control
equal political "power" can be measured by comparing the statistical probability under each system that a person's vote will determine the election
result). Cf. Whitcomb, 403 U. S., at 145, n. 23.

24 In addition, in one respect there is a significant tension between the

terms of the results test and an interpretation of the Act that reaches vote
dilution claims. Section 2(b) provides that a violation may be established
where it is shown that members of a minority have less opportunity than
other members of the electorate "to participate in the political process
and to elect representatives of their choice." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(b) (emphasis added). We have held that any challenged "standard, practice, or
procedure" must have both of these effects to violate the test outlined in

$ 2(b). See Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U. S. 380, 397 (1991). It is not clear,
however, that a potentially dilutive districting method can satisfy both
prongs of the test. The primary effect of the choice of one districting
system over another will be the direct and mathematically quantifiable
impact that the system will have on a minority group's ability to control
a given number of seats. But even if one assumes that a districting system may therefore be said to impair a group's "opportunity" to "elect representatives of its choice," it is difficult to see how a districting system
could be said to impair a group's opportunity to "participate in the political
process," at least if participation is understood to have any meaning distinct from controlling seats.

of seats has been selected as the measure of effective voting).But in some circumstances, results in recent elections might

also be relevant for demonstrating that a particular practiceconcerning registration or polling has served to suppress minority voting. Better factors to consider would be figures
for voter registration or turnout at the last election, brokendown according to race. But where such data are not

readily available, election results may certainly be "one cir-cumstance" to consider in determining whether a challenged
practice has resulted in denying a minority group access tothe political process. The Act merely directs courts not to
ignore such evidence of electoral outcomes altogether.

Moreover, the language providing that electoral outcomes
may be considered as "one circumstance" in the results test
is explicitly qualified by the provision in $ 2(b) that most directly speaks to the question whether $ 2 was meant to reach
claims of vote dilution--and which suggests that dilution
claims are not covered by the section. The last clause in the
subsection states in unmistakable terms that "nothing in this
section establishes a right to have members of a protected
class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(b). As four Members of the
Court observed in Gingles, there is "an inherent tension"
between this disclaimer of proportional representation and
an interpretation of $ 2 that encompasses vote dilution
claims. 478 U. S., at 84 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). As I explained above, dilution claims, by their very
nature, depend upon a mathematical principle. The heart of
the claim is an assertion that the plaintiff group does not hold
the "proper" number of seats. As a result, the principle for
deciding the case must be supplied by an arithmetic ratio.
Either the group has attained the "proper" number of seats
under the current election system, or it has not.

By declaring that the section provides no right to proportional representation, $ 2(b) necessarily commands that the
existence or absence of proportional electoral results should

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
not become the deciding factor in assessing $ 2 claims. Butin doing so, $ 2(b) removes from consideration the most logical ratio for assessing a claim of vote dilution. To resolve adilution claim under $ 2, therefore, a court either must arbitrarily select a different ratio to represent the "undiluted"
norm, a ratio that would have less intuitive appeal than di-rect proportionality, or it must effectively apply a proportionality test in direct contravention of the text of theAct

25--hence the "inherent tension" between the text of the

Act and vote dilution claims. Given that $ 2 nowhere speaksin terms of "dilution," an explicit disclaimer removing from

the field of play the most natural deciding principle in dilu-tion cases is surely a strong signal that such claims do not
fall within the ambit of the Act.26

25 As I discuss more fully below, our cases have pursued the latter
option. See infra, at 936-944.

26 In Johnson v. De Grandy, post, p. 997, the Court suggests that $ 2(b)

disclaims only a guarantee of success for minority candidates and thus
that it has nothing to say concerning remedial schemes designed to provide a minority group proportional control over seats. See post, at 1014,
n. 11. See also post, at 1026-1027 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment). Minority control, of course, may or may not
result in the election of minority candidates. The Court's reading of the
disclaimer, in my view, distorts the obvious import of the provision. The
clause rejecting a group's right to elect its own members in proportion to
their numbers must be understood as a disclaimer of a minority group's
right to proportional political power. Otherwise, in practical terms, the
clause would be reduced to a nullity.

It should be clear that a system that gives a minority group proportional
control effectively provides the "right" to elect a proportionate number of
minority candidates that the Act disclaims. Whether that right is utilized
by minority voters to elect minority candidates is a matter of the voters'
choice. The De Grandy Court's position seems to be that the proviso is
directed, not at a system intended to guarantee the ability to elect minority candidates in proportion to the minority's numbers, but only at a
system that will invariably guarantee the election of a proportionate
number of minority candidates. Only one system would fit that description: a system based on a racial register in which a quota of seats are set
aside for members of a minority group. I think it would be preposterous

It is true that the terms "standard, practice, or procedure"in $ 5 of the Act have been construed to reach districting

systems and other potentially dilutive electoral mechanisms,see,

e. g., Allen, 393 U. S., at 569, and Congress has reenacted

$ 5 subsequent to our decisions adopting that expansive interpretation. See, e. g., United States v. Sheffield Bd. of
Comm'rs, 435 U. S. 110, 134-135 (1978); Georgia v. United
States, 411 U. S. 526, 533 (1973). Nevertheless, the text ofthe section suggests precisely the same focus on measures

that relate to access to the ballot that appears in $ 2. Sec-tion 5 requires covered jurisdictions to obtain preclearance
for a change in "any voting qualification or prerequisite tovoting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to
voting." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c. As in $ 2, the specific terms in
the list of regulated state actions describe only laws thatwould limit access to the ballot. Moreover, $ 5 makes the

focus on the individual voter and access to the voting booth
even more apparent as the section goes on to state that "no
person shall be denied the right to vote for failure to comply with such qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice,
or procedure." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c (emphasis added). This
command makes it explicit that in regulating standards,
practices, or procedures with respect to voting, "Congress
was clearly concerned with changes in procedure with which

to suggest that the disclaimer in $ 2(b) was intended solely to prohibit the
use of such a system. Such a device has never, to my knowledge, been
proposed in any voting rights case. Moreover, to the extent that the decisions in White and Whitcomb can inform our understanding of $ 2(b), they
suggest that in expressing a concern that "proportionality" not be used as
the measure of a voting rights violation, Congress was concerned with
proportional electoral power, not merely proportional election of minority
candidates. See, e. g., Whitcomb, 403 U. S., at 153 (rejecting the "failure
of [the minority group] to have legislative seats in proportion to its population" as a sufficient basis for a claim) (emphasis added). The proviso has
been understood in the past simply as a disclaimer of a right to proportional representation, see, e. g., Gingles, 478 U. S., at 84-86, 94 (O'Connor,
J., concurring in judgment), and I think that understanding is correct.

voters could comply." Allen, supra, at 587 (Harlan, J., con-curring in part and dissenting in part). But it should be

obvious that a districting system, or any other potentiallydilutive mechanism for that matter, is not something with
which a voter can comply. As is the case with $ 2, $ 5's de-scription of the terms "standard, practice, or procedure" thus
suggests a focus on rules that regulate the individual voter'sability to register and cast a ballot, not a more abstract concern with the effect that various electoral systems mighthave on the "weight" of the votes cast by a group that constitutes a numerical minority in the electorate.In my view, the tension between the terms of the Act and
the construction we have placed on $ 5 at the very least sug-gests that our interpretation of $ 5 should not be adopted
wholesale to supply the meaning of the terms "standard,practice, or procedure" under $ 2. An expansive construction of $ 5 was well established in 1980, yet a plurality of theCourt in Bolden, after focusing on the terms of the Act, did
not adopt a similarly expansive construction of $ 2. Rather,the

Bolden plurality concluded that $ 2 should be strictly lim-ited to have the same reach as the Fifteenth Amendment,

which the plurality interpreted as addressing only mattersrelating to access to the ballot. See Bolden, 446 U. S., at 61,
65. I would reach a similar result here. Where a carefulreading of the language of $ 2 dictates a narrow interpretation of the section, there is no reason for transplanting ourinterpretation of the terms of $ 5--an interpretation that I
believe is in tension with the text of $ 5 itself--to anothersection of the Act.

27

27 I need not decide in this case whether I would overrule our decisions
construing the terms "standard, practice, or procedure" in $ 5; the challenge here involves only $ 2. Although in my view our construction of $ 5
may well be incorrect as a matter of first impression, stare decisis would
suggest that such an error in prior decisions may not in itself justify overruling settled precedent. Determining whether to abandon prior decisions requires weighing a multitude of factors, one of the most important
of which is the extent to which the decisions in question have proved
unworkable. Cf. infra, at 936-937. In that regard, while the practical

From the foregoing, it should be clear that, as far as thetext of the Voting Rights Act is concerned, "$ 2 does not

speak in terms of `vote dilution.' " Gingles, 478 U. S., at 87(

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). One might wonder,then, why we have consistently concluded that "[w]e know

that Congress intended to allow vote dilution claims to bebrought under $ 2." Id., at 84. The juxtaposition of the
two statements surely makes the result in our cases appearextraordinary, since it suggests a sort of statutory construction through divination that has allowed us to determine thatCongress "really meant" to enact a statute about vote dilution even though Congress did not do so explicitly. In truth,our method of construing $ 2 has been only little better than
that, for the only source we have relied upon for the expan-sive meaning we have given $ 2 has been the legislative history of the Act.We first considered the amended $ 2 in Thornburg v. Gingles. Although the precise scope of the terms "standard,practice, or procedure" was not specifically addressed in that
case, Gingles nevertheless established our current interpre-tation of the amended section as a provision that addresses
vote dilution, and in particular it fixed our understanding
that the results test in $ 2(b) is intended to measure votedilution in terms of electoral outcomes. See

id., at 93
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (stating that Ginglesmade electoral results the "linchpin" of vote dilution claims).

In reaching its interpretation of $ 2, the Gingles Court redifferences in the application of $$ 2 and 5 that Justice Kennedy points
out, see ante, at 883-884, would not, in my view, suggest as an original
matter that the same terms in the two sections should be read to have
different meanings, Justice Kennedy's observations might suggest that
different considerations would have a bearing on the question whether
our past interpretations should be abandoned in the $ 5 and $ 2 contexts.
Indeed, in the $ 5 context they might suggest a contrary conclusion to
the result I reach under $ 2. See infra, at 936-945. That, however, is a
question for another day.

jected the argument advanced by the United States as ami-cus curiae that $ 2(b)'s test based on an equal "opportunity

. . . to participate in the political process and to elect repre-sentatives" suggested a focus on nothing more than securing
equal access to the political process, not a focus on measuringthe influence of a minority group's votes in terms of electoral
outcomes. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiaein

Thornburg v. Gingles, O. T. 1985, No. 83-1968, pp. 7-19.That understanding of $ 2 is, of course, compatible with the

interpretation I have set out above.In approaching $ 2, the Gingles Court, based on little more
than a bald assertion that "the authoritative source for legis-lative intent lies in the Committee Reports on the bill," 478
U. S., at 43, n. 7, bypassed a consideration of the text of theAct and proceeded to interpret the section based almost exclusively on its legislative history.28 It was from the legisla-tive history that the Court culled its understanding that $ 2

28 In offering two citations to support the sweeping proposition that
committee reports provide the authoritative source for legislative intent,
Gingles plainly misread the import of our prior decisions. Far from giving an unqualified endorsement of committee reports as a guide to congressional intent, the Court in Garcia v. United States, 469 U. S. 70 (1984),
merely indicated that, when resort to legislative history is necessary, it
is only committee reports, not the various other sources of legislative
history, that should be considered. See id., at 76. The Court, however,
carefully repeated Justice Jackson's admonition that "[r]esort to legislative
history is only justified where the face of the [statute] is inescapably ambiguous." Id., at 76, n. 3 (quoting Schwegmann Brothers v. Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U. S. 384, 395 (1951) (concurring opinion)). Similarly, in
Zuber v. Allen, 396 U. S. 168 (1969), we considered the reliability of committee reports only as a relative matter in comparing them to statements
made by individual Congressmen during floor debates. See id., at 186.

Even if I agreed with Justice Jackson that resort to legislative history
is permissible when the text of a statute is "inescapably ambiguous," I
could not agree with the use the Court has made of legislative history in
interpreting $ 2. I think it is clear, first, that in interpreting $ 2 the Court
has never undertaken any inquiry into the meaning of the plain language
of the statute to determine whether it is ambiguous, and second, that the
text of $ 2 is not riddled with such hopeless ambiguity.

is a provision encompassing claims that an electoral systemhas diluted a minority group's vote and its understanding

that claims of dilution are to be evaluated based upon howclosely electoral outcomes under a given system approximate
the outcomes that would obtain under an alternative, undiluted norm. See, e. g., id., at 43-51.Contrary to the remarkable "legislative history first"

method of statutory construction pursued in Gingles, how-ever, I had thought it firmly established that the "authoritative source" for legislative intent was the text of the statutepassed by both Houses of Congress and presented to the
President, not a series of partisan statements about purposes
and objectives collected by congressional staffers and packaged into a committee report. "We have stated time and
again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a
statute what it means and means in a statute what it says
there." Germain, 503 U. S., at 253-254. See also United
States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235, 241-242
(1989); Oneale v. Thornton, 6 Cranch 53, 68 (1810). Nevertheless, our analysis in Gingles was marked conspicuously by
the absence of any attempt to pursue a close reading of the
text of the Act. As outlined above, had the Court addressed
the text, it would have concluded that the terms of the Act
do not address matters of vote "dilution."

Moreover, the legislative history of $ 2 itself, and the
Court's use of it in Gingles, aptly illustrate that legislative
history is often used by this Court as "a forensic rather than
an interpretive device," Wisconsin Public Intervenor v.
Mortier, 501 U. S. 597, 621 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in
judgment), and is read selectively to support the result the
Court intends to achieve. It is well documented in the history of the 1982 amendments to the Act that $ 2 was passed
only after a compromise was reached through the addition of
the provision in $ 2(b) disclaiming any right to proportional
representation. See S. Rep. No. 97-417, pp. 2-4 (1982); id.,
at 94-97 (additional views of Sen. Hatch). But the views of

512us3$94n 01-08-98 12:46:53 PAGES OPINPGT
934 HOLDER v. HALL

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
the author of that compromise, Senator Dole, hardly coincidewith the gloss the Court has placed on $ 2.

According to Senator Dole, amended $ 2 would "[a]bso-lutely not" provide any redress to a group of voters challenging electoral mechanisms in a jurisdiction "if the process is
open, if there is equal access, if there are no barriers, director indirect, thrown up to keep someone from voting or having their vote counted, or registering, whatever the processmay include." 128 Cong. Rec. 14133 (1982). Contrary to
the Court's interpretation of the section in Gingles, SenatorDole viewed $ 2 as a provision more narrowly focused on

access to the processes surrounding the casting of a ballot, not
a provision concerned with ensuring electoral outcomes in
accordance with some "undiluted" norm. See S. Rep. No.
97-417, supra, at 193-194 (additional views of Sen. Dole).
The legislative history thus hardly provided unambiguous
support for the Court's interpretation; indeed, it seems that
the Court used what was helpful to its interpretation in the
legislative history and ignored what was not. Cf. Mortier,
supra, at 617 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).

Of course, as mentioned above, Gingles did not directly
address the meaning of the terms "standard, practice, or procedure" in $ 2(a). The understanding that those terms extend to a State's laws establishing various electoral mechanisms dates to our decision in Allen, in which we construed
the identical terms in $ 5 of the Act. But the Court's method
of statutory construction in Allen was little different from
that pursued in Gingles, and as the analysis of the text of $ 5
above demonstrates, it similarly yielded an interpretation in
tension with the terms of the Act.

In Allen, after noting that $ 14(c)(1) defined "voting" to
include "all action necessary to make a vote effective," 42
U. S. C. $ 1973l(c)(1), the Court abandoned any further attempt to construe the text of the Act and went on, instead,
to conclude that the "legislative history on the whole supports the view that Congress intended to reach any state

enactment which altered the election law of a covered Statein even a minor way."

Allen, 393 U. S., at 566. Not surprisingly, the legislative history relied upon in Allen also dis-played the typical flaws that one might expect--it was

hardly unequivocal. See id., at 590-591, and n. 9 (Harlan, J.,
concurring in part and dissenting in part) (noting inconsist-encies in the legislative history). Thus, to the extent that

Allen implicitly has served as the basis for our subsequentinterpretation of the terms of $ 2, it hardly can be thought
to provide any surer rooting in the language of the Act thanthe method of statutory construction pursued in

Gingles.
Remarkably, thanks to our reliance on legislative history,
we have interpreted $ 2 in such a way that four Members of
this Court at one time candidly admitted that "[t]here is an
inherent tension [in $ 2] between what Congress wished to
do and what it wished to avoid." Gingles, 478 U. S., at 84
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). But our understanding of what Congress purportedly "wished to do"--that
is, to allow claims of vote "dilution"--depends solely on a
selective reading of legislative history, whereas Congress'
statement of what it "wished to avoid" appears explicitly in

$ 2(b)'s disclaimer of a right to proportional representation.
I can see no logical reason to import the "inherent tension"
between these two imperatives into the Act, when on its face
the statute incorporates only one of two potentially contradictory commands. I would have thought the key to resolving any such conflict between the text and the legislative
history obvious: The text of the statute must control, and the
text of $ 2 does not extend the Act to claims of dilution.

Were it our function to interpret and apply committee reports or other pieces of legislative history, rather than Acts
of Congress, I might conclude that we had made the best of
a bad situation in interpreting $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act,
and that the quagmire that is $ 2 was Congress' creation, not
our own. It is apparent, however, that we have arrived at
our current understanding of the Act, with all of its attend512us3$94n 01-08-98 12:46:53 PAGES OPINPGT

ant pitfalls, only by abandoning proper methods of statutoryconstruction. Our errors in method in past cases ordinarily

might not indicate a need to forsake an established line ofprecedent. But here they have produced an "inherent tension" between our interpretation of $ 2 and the text of theAct and have yielded a construction of the statute that, as I
discuss below, is so unworkable in practice and destructivein its effects that it must be repudiated.

C
"Stare decisis is not an inexorable command," Payne v.
Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991). Indeed, "when govern-ing decisions are unworkable or are badly reasoned, this

Court has never felt constrained to follow precedent." Id.,at 827 (internal quotation marks omitted). The discussion
above should make clear that our decision in Gingles inter-preting the scope of $ 2 was badly reasoned; it wholly substituted reliance on legislative history for analysis of statutorytext. In doing so, it produced a far more expansive interpretation of $ 2 than a careful reading of the language of thestatute would allow.

Our interpretation of $ 2 has also proved unworkable. AsI outlined above, it has mired the federal courts in an inherently political task--one that requires answers to questionsthat are ill-suited to principled judicial resolution. Under

$ 2, we have assigned the federal judiciary a project that in-volves, not the application of legal standards to the facts of
various cases or even the elaboration of legal principles on acase-by-case basis, but rather the creation of standards from
an abstract evaluation of political philosophy.Worse, our interpretation of $ 2 has required us to distort
our decisions to obscure the fact that the political choice atthe heart of our cases rests on precisely the principle the Act
condemns: proportional allocation of political power accord-ing to race. Continued adherence to a line of decisions that
necessitates such dissembling cannot possibly promote what

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
we have perceived to be one of the central values of thepolicy of

stare decisis: the preservation of "the actual and
perceived integrity of the judicial process." Payne, supra,at 827.

I have endeavored to explain above that the core of any
vote dilution claim is an assertion that the plaintiff groupdoes not hold seats in the proportion that it should.

29 There

is no logical way to avoid reliance on a simple ratio in evalu-ating such a claim. And allocation of seats in direct proportion to the minority group's percentage in the populationprovides the most logical ratio to apply as an "undiluted"
norm. But $ 2 makes it clear that the Act does not create aright to proportional representation, and thus dictates that
proportionality should not provide the rule of decision for$ 2 claims. See

supra, at 927-928, and n. 26. Nevertheless,
despite the statutory command, in deciding claims of vote
dilution we have turned to proportionality as a guide, simply
for lack of any better alternative.

No formulation of the test for evaluating vote dilution
claims has ever dispensed with the inevitable need to consult
a mathematical formula to decide a case. The factors listed
in White v. Regester, 412 U. S., at 766-767, resurrected in the
Senate Report on the 1982 amendments to $ 2, see S. Rep.
No. 97-417, at 28-29, and finally reincorporated into our decision in Gingles, see 478 U. S., at 44-45, although praised in
our cases as a multifaceted test ensuring that vote dilution
is determined based on the "totality of circumstances," in
reality provide no rule for deciding a vote dilution claim
based on anything other than a numerical principle.

29 I assume for purposes of the analysis here that the measure of effective votes is control of seats. That is precisely the measure the Court has
applied, both in the past, see, e. g., Gingles, 478 U. S., at 46-51; id., at 93, 99
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (noting that the Court had made
electoral results the "linchpin" of dilution claims), and today, see Johnson
v. De Grandy, post, at 1014-1015 (equating "political effectiveness" with
control of majority-minority districts).

938 HOLDER v. HALL

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
In Gingles, we condensed the import of these "factors" intoa formula stating that the "essence" of a vote dilution claim

under $ 2 is that "a certain electoral law, practice, or struc-ture interacts with social and historical conditions to cause
an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and white
voters to elect their preferred representatives." Id., at 47.But it should be apparent that whether an electoral practice

does or does not reduce the ability of a numerical minorityto control the election of representatives can be determined
wholly without reference to "social and historical condi-tions."

Ibid. The dilutive effects of various electoral procedures are matters of mathematics. The "social and historical conditions" "interact" with the election mechanism, and
thus are relevant in a vote dilution case, only to the extent
that they are important for establishing that the minority
group does in fact define a distinct political interest group
that might assert that its vote has been diluted by the mechanism at issue. Such social and historical considerations,
however, cannot supply the answer to the ultimate question
whether the group's vote has been diluted.

In reality, the list of White factors provides nothing more
than just that: a list of possible considerations that might be
consulted by a court attempting to develop a gestalt view of
the political and racial climate in a jurisdiction, but a list
that cannot provide a rule for deciding a vote dilution claim.
Take, for example, a case in which a district court determines
that a minority group constituting 34% of the population in
a certain jurisdiction has suffered discrimination in the past,
that the group currently bears the effects of that discrimination, and that there has been a history of racial campaigning
in the jurisdiction. Cf. White, supra, at 766-767. How can
these facts possibly answer the question whether the group's
votes have been diluted if the group controls two rather than
three seats in a 10-member governing body? Will the answer to the ultimate question change if the first two factors
are found, but the third is not? Obviously, the various "fac512us3$94n 01-08-98 12:46:53 PAGES OPINPGT

939Cite as: 512 U. S. 874 (1994)
Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
tors," singly or in any combination, cannot provide a princi-ple for determining the result. What one must know to decide the case is whether 20% of the seats in the governmentis sufficient to reflect "undiluted" voting strength, or if 30%
should be required.

Of course, as suggested above, the White factors may berelevant to determining as a threshold matter whether the

minority group is a distinct political group that should beable to assert a claim of dilution. But after

Gingles, the
inquiry into whether race defines political interest effectivelyhas been boiled down to the weakened test for minority "political cohesiveness" and majority bloc voting embodied in
the second and third Gingles preconditions. See 478 U. S.,
at 51. Once a plaintiff group establishes that it is mathematically possible for it to control another seat (that is, that
it satisfies the first Gingles precondition of size and geographic compactness), see id., at 50, and that it is a distinct
political group (that is, that it can show political cohesion and
majority bloc voting), the only question remaining in the
vote dilution claim is whether the current number of seats is
the proper number or not. The other White factors have
become essentially superfluous. They may be dutifully intoned by courts performing the empty ritual of applying the
"totality of circumstances" test, but they can provide no
guidance concerning whether the current allocation of seats
constitutes "dilution." Cf. Gingles, supra, at 92-93 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (suggesting that the basic
contours of a dilution claim require no reference to most of
the White factors).

In short, it should be clear that the factors listed in Gingles--in their various incarnations and by whatever names
they are known--are nothing but puffery used to fill out an
impressive verbal formulation and to create the impression
that the outcome in a vote dilution case rests upon a reasoned evaluation of a variety of relevant circumstances.
The "totality of circumstances" test outlined in Gingles thus

512us3$94n 01-08-98 12:46:53 PAGES OPINPGT

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
serves to obscure the inherent conflict between the text ofthe Act and an underlying reliance on proportionality.

The resort to proportionality in our cases should hardlycome as a surprise. Before $ 2 was amended in 1982, and
thus before the Act explicitly disavowed a right to proportional representation, some Members of the Court recog-nized the inevitable drift toward proportional representation

that would occur if the test outlined in White were used toevaluate vote dilution claims. As Justice Stewart, writing
for four Members of the Court, observed, the factors listedin

White amounted to little more than "gauzy sociological
considerations," and it did not appear that "they could, in
any principled manner, exclude the claims of any discrete
political group that happens, for whatever reason, to elect
fewer of its candidates than arithmetic indicates it might."
Bolden, 446 U. S., at 75, n. 22 (emphasis added). Indeed,
Justice Stewart was correct in concluding that "the putative
limits [imposed by the White factors] are bound to prove
illusory if the express purpose informing their application
would be," as our vote dilution cases have assumed, "to redress the inequitable distribution of political influence."
Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).

In fact, the framework established by this Court for evaluating vote dilution claims in Gingles was at its inception
frankly, and in my view correctly, labeled as setting a rule of
roughly proportional representation. See Gingles, supra, at
91, 93, 97-99 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). Nothing has happened in the intervening years to change the
basic import of the Gingles test. Yet we have continued to
apply the same Gingles framework, see, e. g., Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25 (1993), all the while suggesting that we are
pursuing merely a "totality of the circumstances" test.

In another case decided today, the Court reconfirms the
unstated centrality of proportional results in an opinion that
demonstrates the obfuscation that must come to characterize
our Voting Rights Act rulings if we continue to entertain

dilution claims while pretending to renounce reliance on pro-portionality as a rule of decision. In

Johnson v. De Grandy,
post, p. 997, the Court assures us that proportionality doesnot provide the principle for deciding vote dilution claims.

Post, at 1000, 1017-1021. Rather, the result in each case
must depend on a searching inquiry into the ever-nebulouslydefined "totality of circumstances."

Post, at 1000.
But after the Gingles preconditions have been established,
post, at 1008-1009, and after White factors such as a history
of discrimination have been found, see post, at 1013, wheredoes the Court turn for a deciding principle to give some

meaning to these multifarious facts, which taken individually
would each appear to count in favor of a finding of vote
dilution? Quite simply, the Court turns to proportionality:
"Treating equal political opportunity as the focus of the
enquiry, we do not see how these district lines, apparently
providing political effectiveness [that is, majority-minority
districts] in proportion to voting-age numbers, deny equal
political opportunity." Post, at 1014. See also post, at 1013
(noting that in assessing "dilutive effect," the "pertinent
features" of the districting system at issue "were majorityminority districts in substantial proportion to the minority's
share of voting-age population"); post, at 1025 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring) (the Court's central teaching in De Grandy "is
that proportionality--defined as the relationship between
the number of majority-minority voting districts and the minority group's share of the relevant population--is always
relevant evidence in determining vote dilution"). Justice
O'Connor's comment about the Court's holding in Davis
v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109 (1986), is equally applicable to
the course pursued in De Grandy today: "[The Court's decision] ultimately rests on a political preference for proportionality--. . . a conviction that the greater the departure
from proportionality, the more suspect an apportionment
plan becomes." 478 U. S., at 159 (opinion concurring in
judgment).

942 HOLDER v. HALL

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
To be sure, the De Grandy Court repeatedly declares thatproportionality is not a defense to a vote dilution claim. See

post, at 1017-1021. That, of course, must be the stated rule ifwe are not to abandon openly the explicit disclaimer enacted
by Congress in $ 2(b). But given the Court's equivocation--
proportionality is still always relevant--and the Court's ulti-mate analysis, such assurances ring hollow. The Court decides the question of dilution based upon proportionality.And it is apparent from the reasons the Court gives for rejecting maximization as a rule for decision that proportional-ity will drive results in future dilution cases as well.

Consider, for example, the hypothetical rehearsed by the
Court concerning a jurisdiction with a 10-member elected
body and a 40% minority voting population. See post, at
1016-1017. Assume that as currently constituted the districting scheme creates four majority-minority districts.
Even if it is established in this hypothetical jurisdiction that
all of the Gingles factors have been proved (as was found
in De Grandy), and that there are both a history of discrimination and continuing discrimination (as was found in
De Grandy), can it be seriously contended that the minority
group can succeed, under any combination of facts, in bringing a $ 2 challenge to require the creation of the mathematically possible seven majority-minority districts? The Court
recognizes that it would be "absurd" to think that $ 2 would
allow such a result. That, after all, would give the group
"effective political power 75 percent above its numerical
strength"--that is, above its proportion in the population.
Post, at 1017 (emphasis added). But if it is absurd to give
the members of the group seven seats, why is it not equally
ridiculous to give them six, or five? Or, indeed, anything
beyond the four that would secure them seats in proportion
to their numbers in the population?

If it is absurd to give members of the group seven seats,
that is because, as the Court tacitly acknowledges, we
assume that seats in accord with "numerical strength" will

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
ensure the group "equal" "political effectiveness." Thus,
deliberately drawing districts so as to give, under the assumptions of the hypothetical, 40% of the population control
over 50% of the seats, while leaving 60% of the population
with control of a similar 50% of the seats, would seem to us
unfair. Greater deviations from proportionality may appear
more patently "absurd" than lesser, but the dividing line between what seems fair and what does not remains the same.
The driving principle is proportionality.30

Few words would be too strong to describe the dissembling that pervades the application of the "totality of circumstances" test under our interpretation of $ 2. It is an empty
incantation--a mere conjurer's trick that serves to hide the

30 Of course, throughout this discussion concerning the Court's inevitable
resort to proportionality, I have assumed that effective votes will be measured in terms of control of seats. See n. 29, supra. As Justice O'Connor suggests in her opinion in De Grandy, if we were to measure the
effectiveness of votes not simply in terms of numbers of seats, but in terms
of some more amorphous concept of "access to the political process," there
would be no need to make proportionality "dispositive." See De Grandy,
post, at 1026 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Cf. White, 412 U. S., at 765-766.
But Gingles made control of seats the determining factor in dilution
claims; that is the measure that has been applied in cases under Gingles,
and it remains the measure applied in practice in the cases handed down
today. In my view, it is unrealistic to think that the Court will now reverse course and establish some broader understanding of "political effectiveness" under the "totality of circumstances" test, after it consistently
has pursued a measure of effective voting that makes electoral results the
"linchpin" of dilution claims. See 478 U. S., at 93 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).

Indeed, any change in course is made more unlikely by one very practical consideration. As the Court's decision in De Grandy perhaps suggests, measuring political effectiveness by any method other than counting
numbers of seats can rapidly become a wholly unmanageable task. As I
suggested above, see n. 6, supra, one of the reasons the Court seized upon
control of seats as a measure of effective political participation is simply
that control of seats provides the "most easily measured indicia of political power." Bandemer, 478 U. S., at 157 (O'Connor, J., concurring in
judgment).

drive for proportionality that animates our decisions. Asactions such as that brought in

Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630
(1993), have already started to show, what might euphemisti-cally be termed the benign "creation of majority-minority

single-member districts to enhance the opportunity of minority groups to elect representatives of their choice" might alsomore simply and more truthfully be termed "racial gerrymandering." Similarly, what we might call a "totality of cir-cumstances" test to determine whether an electoral practice
"interacts with social and historical conditions to cause aninequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and white
voters to elect their preferred representatives," Gingles, 478
U. S., at 47, might more accurately be called a test for ensuring proportional electoral results according to race. Cf. id.,
at 97 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).

In my view, our current practice should not continue. Not
for another Term, not until the next case, not for another
day. The disastrous implications of the policies we have
adopted under the Act are too grave; the dissembling in our
approach to the Act too damaging to the credibility of the
Federal Judiciary. The "inherent tension"--indeed, I would
call it an irreconcilable conflict--between the standards we
have adopted for evaluating vote dilution claims and the text
of the Voting Rights Act would itself be sufficient in my view
to warrant overruling the interpretation of $ 2 set out in Gingles. When that obvious conflict is combined with the destructive effects our expansive reading of the Act has had in
involving the Federal Judiciary in the project of dividing the
Nation into racially segregated electoral districts, I can see
no reasonable alternative to abandoning our current unfortunate understanding of the Act.

Stare decisis is a powerful concern, especially in the field
of statutory construction. See Patterson v. McLean Credit
Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172 (1989). See also Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U. S. 517, 538-539 (1994) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). But "we have never applied stare decisis

mechanically to prohibit overruling our earlier decisions de-termining the meaning of statutes."

Monell v. New York
City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 695 (1978). Stare
decisis should not bind the Court to an interpretation of the
Voting Rights Act that was based on a flawed method of
statutory construction from its inception and that in everyday of its continued existence involves the Federal Judiciary

in attempts to obscure the conflict between our cases and theexplicit commands of the Act. The Court has noted in the
past that stare decisis " `is a principle of policy,' " Payne, 501U. S., at 828 (quoting

Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119
(1940)), and it " `is usually the wise policy, because in most
matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law
be settled than it be settled right.' " 501 U. S., at 827 (quoting Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406
(1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)). I cannot subscribe to the
view that in our decisions under the Voting Rights Act it is
more important that we have a settled rule than that we
have the right rule. When, under our direction, federal
courts are engaged in methodically carving the country into
racially designated electoral districts, it is imperative that
we stop to reconsider whether the course we have charted
for the Nation is the one set by the people through their
representatives in Congress. I believe it is not.

I cannot adhere to the construction of $ 2 embodied in our
decision in Thornburg v. Gingles. I reject the assumption
implicit in that case that the terms "standard, practice, or
procedure" in $ 2(a) of the Voting Rights Act can be construed to cover potentially dilutive electoral mechanisms.
Understood in context, those terms extend the Act's prohibitions only to state enactments that regulate citizens' access
to the ballot or the processes for counting a ballot. The
terms do not include a State's or political subdivision's choice
of one districting scheme over another. The terms certainly
do not include, as respondents would argue, the size of a local
governing authority.

Blackmun, J., dissenting

III
For the foregoing reasons, I agree with the Court's conclu-sion that the size of a governing body is not subject to challenge under $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act. I therefore concurin the Court's judgment reversing the judgment below and
remanding for consideration of respondents' constitutionalclaim of intentional discrimination.

Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

Five Justices today agree that the size of a governing bodyis a "standard, practice, or procedure" under $ 2 of the Voting

Rights Act of 1965 (Act), as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973. Adifferent five Justices decide, under three separate theories,
that voting rights plaintiffs cannot bring $ 2 dilution chal-lenges based on size. I, however, believe that the Act, its
history, and our own precedent require us to conclude notonly that the size of a governing body is a "standard, practice, or procedure" under $ 2, but also that minority votersmay challenge the dilutive effects of this practice by demonstrating their potential to elect representatives under an ob-jectively reasonable alternative practice. Accordingly, I dissent from the Court's decision that minority voters cannotbring $ 2 vote dilution challenges based on the size of an existing government body. I

Section 2(a) of the Act prohibits the imposition or applica-tion of any "voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or
standard, practice, or procedure" that "results in a denial orabridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States
to vote on account of race or color." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(a)(emphasis added). Section 5 parallels $ 2 by requiring certain jurisdictions to preclear with the Attorney General achange in "any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting,
or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting."42 U. S. C. $ 1973c (emphasis added). Under the broad inter512us3$94f 01-08-98 12:46:53 PAGES OPINPGT

pretation that this Court, Congress, and the Attorney Gen-eral consistently have given the Act in general and $ 5 in

particular, the practice of electing a single commissioner, asopposed to a multimember commission, constitutes a "standard, practice, or procedure" under $ 2.

Nearly 30 years of precedent admonish us that the Act,which was adopted "for the broad remedial purpose of `rid[ding] the country of racial discrimination in voting,' " Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U. S. 380, 403 (1991), quoting South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 315 (1966), should be given"the broadest possible scope,"

Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U. S. 544, 567 (1969). Because "the Act itself nowhere amplifies the meaning of the phrase `standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting,' " the Court "ha[s]
sought guidance from the history and purpose of the Act."
Dougherty County Bd. of Ed. v. White, 439 U. S. 32, 37
(1978); see also McCain v. Lybrand, 465 U. S. 236, 246 (1984)
(the Act must "be interpreted in light of its prophylactic purpose and the historical experience which it reflects").

Consistent with the Act's remedial purposes, this Court
has held that a wide variety of election- and voting-related
practices fit within the term "standard, practice, or procedure." Among the covered practices are the annexation of
land to enlarge city boundaries, see Perkins v. Matthews, 400
U. S. 379, 388 (1971), and Pleasant Grove v. United States,
479 U. S. 462, 467 (1987); a rule requiring employees to take
leaves of absence while they campaign for elective office, see
Dougherty County Bd. of Ed., 439 U. S., at 34; candidate filing dates and other procedural requirements, see Whitley v.
Williams, decided with Allen v. State Bd. of Elections,
supra; Hadnott v. Amos, 394 U. S. 358, 365 (1969); NAACP
v. Hampton County Election Comm'n, 470 U. S. 166, 176-177
(1985); and candidate residency requirements, see City of
Rome v. United States, 446 U. S. 156, 160 (1980).

Specifically, this Court long has treated a change in the
size of a governing authority as a change in a "standard,

512us3$94f 01-08-98 12:46:53 PAGES OPINPGT

Blackmun, J., dissenting
practice, or procedure" with respect to voting. In City of
Rome, 446 U. S., at 161, it noted that it "is not disputed" that
an expansion in the size of a board of education was "within
the purview of the Act" and subject to preclearance under

$ 5. In City of Lockhart v. United States, 460 U. S. 125, 131
(1983), it stated that a change from a three-member commission to a five-member commission was subject to $ 5 preclearance. And, most recently, it said that the term "standard,
practice, or procedure with respect to voting" included a
change in the size of a governing authority or an increase
or decrease in the number of elected offices. Presley v.
Etowah County Comm'n, 502 U. S. 491, 500 (1992).

This conclusion flowed naturally from the holding in Bunton v. Patterson, 393 U. S. 544 (1969), that a change from an
elected to an appointed office was a "standard, practice, or
procedure with respect to voting." In Bunton, the Court
reasoned that the power of a citizen's vote is affected by the
change because the citizen has been "prohibited from electing an officer formerly subject to the approval of the voters."
Id., at 570. The reverse is also true: A change from an appointed to an elected office affects a citizen's voting power
by increasing the number of officials for whom he may vote.
See McCain v. Lybrand, 465 U. S. 236 (1984). And, as the
Court recognized in Presley, a change in the size of a governing authority is a "standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting" because the change "increase[s] or diminish[es] the number of officials for whom the electorate may
vote," 502 U. S., at 503; this change bears "on the substance
of voting power" and has "a direct relation to voting and the
election process." Ibid.

To date, our precedent has dealt with $ 5 challenges to a
change in the size of a governing authority, rather than $ 2
challenges to the existing size of a governing body. I agree

connection" between $$ 2 and 5, we interpret them similarly.See Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U. S., at 402 (concluding that it
would be "anomalous" to do otherwise). And in the contextof $ 2, the Court stated: "Section 2 protected the right to

Significantly, when Congress considered the 1982 amend-ments to the Voting Rights Act, it made no effort to curtail

the application of $ 5 to changes in size, in the face of thelongstanding practice of submitting such changes for preclearance, and on the heels of this Court's recognition justtwo years earlier that it was "not disputed" that a change in
the size of a governing body was covered under $ 5. See

body.2 It is not surprising that no party to this case arguedthat the size of a governing authority is not a "standard,

practice, or procedure."In light of this consistent and expansive interpretation of
the Act by this Court, Congress, and the Attorney General,
the Act's "all-inclusive" definition of "standard, practice, orprocedure" cannot be read to exclude threshold coverage of

challenges to the size of a governing authority. As fiveMembers of the Court today agree, the size of a governing
authority is a "standard, practice, or procedure" with respectto voting for purposes of $ 2 as well as $ 5 of the Voting
Rights Act.

II

Although five Justices agree that the size of a governing
body is a "standard, practice, or procedure" under $ 2, a like
number of Justices conclude, under varying rationales, that
Voting Rights plaintiffs nonetheless cannot bring size challenges under $ 2. This conclusion is inconsistent with our
precedent giving the Act " `the broadest possible scope' in
combating racial discrimination," Chisom, 501 U. S., at 403,
quoting Allen, 393 U. S., at 567, and with the vote-dilution

analysis prescribed in Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30(1986).

To prevail in a vote-dilution challenge, minority votersmust show that they "possess the potential to elect representatives in the absence of the challenged structure orpractice."

Id., at 50, n. 17 (second emphasis supplied).3There is widespread agreement, see ante, at 880 (opinion of

Kennedy, J., and Rehnquist, C. J.); ante, at 887 (opinion of
O'Connor, J.), that minority voters' potential "in the ab-sence of " the allegedly dilutive mechanism must be measured against the benchmark of an alternative structure orpractice that is reasonable and workable under the facts of
the specific case.4By all objective measures, the proposed five-member
Bleckley County Commission presents a reasonable, work-able benchmark against which to measure the practice of
electing a sole commissioner. First, the Georgia Legisla-ture specifically authorized a five-member commission for
Bleckley County. 1985 Ga. Laws 4406. Moreover, a five-member commission is the most common form of governing
authority in Georgia. See Georgia Dept. of Community Af3 Although Gingles dealt with the use of multimember districts, the
analysis it prescribes is applicable in certain other vote-dilution contexts,
such as a claim of "vote fragmentation" through single-member districts,
see Growe v. Emison, 507 U. S. 25, 37-42 (1993), or the case before us.

4 As the United States explains, the minority group must be permitted

to establish that, under "a proposed alternative voting arrangement that
is reasonable in the legal and factual context of a particular case," it could
constitute a majority. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 8. The
Court of Appeals followed this approach, concluding that "it is appropriate to consider the size and geographical compactness of the minority
group within a restructured form of the challenged system when the existing structure is being challenged as dilutive" (emphasis in original). 955

fairs, County Government Information Catalog (1989) (Table
1.A: Form of Government) (76 of Georgia's 159 counties had
five commissioners, including 25 counties smaller than
Bleckley County). Bleckley County, as one of a small and
dwindling number of counties in Georgia still employing a
sole commissioner, markedly departs from practices elsewhere in Georgia. This marked "depart[ure] . . . from practices elsewhere in the jurisdiction . . . bears on the fairness
of [the sole commissioner's] impact." S. Rep. No. 97-417,
p. 29, n. 117 (1982). Finally, the county itself has moved
from a single superintendent of education to a school board
with five members elected from single-member districts,
providing a workable and readily available model for commission districts. Thus, the proposed five-member baseline
is reasonable and workable.

In this case, identifying an appropriate baseline against
which to measure dilution is not difficult. In other cases, it
may be harder. But the need to make difficult judgments
does not "justify a judicially created limitation on the coverage of the broadly worded statute, as enacted and amended
by Congress." Chisom, 501 U. S., at 403. Vote dilution is
inherently a relative concept, requiring a highly "flexible,
fact-intensive" inquiry, Gingles, 478 U. S., at 46, and calling
for an exercise of the "court's overall judgment, based on
the totality of circumstances and guided by those relevant
factors in the particular case," as mandated by Congress.
S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 29, n. 118. Certainly judges who
engage in the complex task of evaluating reapportionment
plans and examining district lines will be able to determine
whether a proposed baseline is an appropriate one against
which to measure a claim of vote dilution based on the
size of a county commission.

There are, to be sure, significant constraints on size challenges. Minority plaintiffs, who bear the burden of demonstrating dilution, also bear the burden of demonstrating that

their proposed benchmark is reasonable and workable. Oneindication of a benchmark's reasonableness is its grounding

in history, custom, or practice. This consideration will dis-courage size challenges to traditional single-member executive offices, such as governors and mayors, or even sheriffs orclerks of court. By tradition and practice, these executive
positions are occupied by one person, so plaintiffs couldrarely point to an objectively reasonable alternative size that
has any foundation in the past or present. Cf. The Federal-ist No. 69, p. 415 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) ("[T]he
executive authority, with few exceptions, is to be vested ina single magistrate"). The sole commissioner, by contrast,
holds plenary legislative, as well as executive, power. Ga.Code Ann. $ 36-5-22.1 (1993). A one-member legislature,
far from being the norm, is an anomaly. Accordingly, theEleventh Circuit, while permitting $ 2 challenges to the practice of electing a sole commissioner, has held that this provi-sion cannot be used to alter the practice of electing a single
person to offices such as lieutenant governor, sheriff, probatejudge, and tax collector. See

Dillard v. Crenshaw County,831 F. 2d 246, 251 (1987); United States v. Dallas County

Additionally, every successful vote-dilution challenge willbe based on the "totality of the circumstances," often including the lingering effects of past discrimination. S. Rep.No. 97-417, at 28-30. Not every racial or language minority that constitutes 5% of the population has a claim tohave a governing authority expanded to 20 members in
order to give them an opportunity to elect a representa-tive. Instead, the voters would have to prove that a 20-

are not within the scope of $ 2, see Houston Lawyers' Assn. v. Attorney

generally susceptible to size challenges under $ 2.

member governing authority was a reasonable benchmark--which, of course, respondents could not do here--and that

their claim satisfied the three Gingles preconditions, 478U. S., at 49, and was warranted under the totality of the
circumstances.6

6 The Senate Report accompanying the 1982 amendments to the Act directed that the vote-dilution inquiry include an examination of the factors
identified in White v. Regester, 412 U. S. 755 (1973), and refined and developed in Zimmer v. McKeithen, 485 F. 2d 1297 (CA5 1973) (en banc), aff'd,
424 U. S. 636 (1976) (per curiam). This nonexclusive list of factors, now
known variously as the Regester-Zimmer factors or "Senate Report factors," includes "the extent of any history of official discrimination . . . that
touched the right of the members of the minority group to register, to
vote, or otherwise to participate in the democratic process; . . . the extent
to which the state or political subdivision has used unusually large election
districts, majority vote requirements, anti-single shot provisions, or other
voting practices or procedures that may enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the minority group; . . . [and] the extent to which
members of the minority group in the state or political subdivision bear
the effects of discrimination in such areas as education, employment and
health, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political
process." S. Rep. No. 97-417, pp. 28-29 (1982).

In this case, for example, the District Court found that, until the passage
of federal civil rights laws, Bleckley County "enforced racial segregation
in all aspects of local government--courthouse, jails, public housing, governmental services--and deprived its black citizens of the opportunity to
participate in local government." Hall v. Holder, 757 F. Supp. 1560, 1562
(MD Ga. 1991). Until the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, "black
citizens were virtually prohibited from registering to vote in Bleckley
County." Id., at 1563. Until 1984, there were no African-American
voting registrars and no voter registration in places where AfricanAmericans normally congregated. Ibid. From 1978 until 1986, the respondent probate judge appointed 224 poll managers, all white, and 509
poll clerks, 479 of whom were white. Ibid. Since 1964, the election of
Bleckley County's sole commissioner has been subject to a majority-vote
requirement. Although official segregation is no longer imposed, its vestiges remain, as "more black than white residents of Bleckley County continue to endure a depressed socio-economic status," id., at 1562, which
"hinders the ability of and deters black residents of Bleckley County from
running for public office, voting and otherwise participating in the political

With these limitations, successful vote-dilution challengesto the size of a governing authority always will be based not

on abstract manipulation of numbers, but on a "searchingpractical evaluation of the `past and present reality.' " S.
Rep. No. 97-417, at 30, quoting White v. Regester, 412 U. S.755, 770 (1973). These limitations protect against a proliferation of vote-dilution challenges premised on eccentric orimpracticable alternative methods of redistricting.

III
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was bold and ambitiouslegislation, designed to eradicate the vestiges of past discrimination and to make members of racial and language mi-norities full participants in American political life. Nearly
30 years after the passage of this landmark civil rightslegislation, its goals remain unfulfilled. Today, the most blatant forms of discrimination--including poll taxes, literacytests, and "white" primaries--have been eliminated. But
subtler, more complex means of infringing minority votingstrength--including submergence or dispersion of minority
voters--are still present and indeed prevalent. We haverecognized over the years that seemingly innocuous and even
well-intentioned election practices may impede minority vot-ers' ability not only to vote, but to have their votes count.
It is clear that the practice of electing a single-membercounty commission can be one such dilutive practice. It is
equally clear that a five-member commission is an appro-priate benchmark against which to measure the alleged dilutive effects of Bleckley County's practice of electing a solecommissioner. I respectfully dissent.

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
Justice Ginsburg, dissenting.
I join the dissenting opinion by Justice Blackmun andthe separate opinion of

Justice Stevens, and add a furtherobservation about the responsibility Congress has given to

the judiciary.Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 calls for an
inquiry into "[t]he extent to which members of a protectedclass have been elected to office," but simultaneously disclaims any "right to have members of a protected classelected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(b). "There is an inherent tension
between what Congress wished to do and what it wished toavoid"--between Congress' "inten[t] to allow vote dilution

claims to be brought under $ 2" and its intent to avoid "creat[ing] a right to proportional representation for minority vot-ers."

Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, 84 (1986) (O'Connor, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Powell and Rehnquist,JJ., concurring in judgment). Tension of this kind is hardly

unique to the Voting Rights Act, for when Congress acts onissues on which its constituents are divided, sometimes bitterly, the give-and-take of legislative compromise can yieldstatutory language that fails to reconcile conflicting goals
and purposes.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for example, issimilarly janus faced, prohibiting discrimination against historically disadvantaged groups, see 42 U. S. C. $$ 2000e-2(a),(d), without "diminish[ing] traditional management prerogatives," Steelworkers v. Weber, 443 U. S. 193, 207 (1979), inregard to employment decisions. See 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-

lasting effects of discrimination against minorities") (empha-sis in original) (citation omitted).

When courts are confronted with congressionally crafted
compromises of this kind, it is "not an easy task" to remain
"faithful to the balance Congress struck." Thornburg v.
Gingles, 478 U. S., at 84 (O'Connor, J., joined by Burger,
C. J., and Powell and Rehnquist, JJ., concurring in judgment). The statute's broad remedial purposes, as well as
the constraints on the courts' remedial powers, need to be
carefully considered in light of the particular circumstances
of each case to arrive at an appropriate resolution of the
competing congressional concerns. However difficult this
task may prove to be, it is one that courts must undertake
because it is their mission to effectuate Congress' multiple
purposes as best they can. See Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U. S.
380, 403 (1991) ("Even if serious problems lie ahead in applying the `totality of the circumstances' [inquiry under $ 2(b) of
the Voting Rights Act], that task, difficult as it may prove to
be, cannot justify a judicially created limitation on the coverage of the broadly worded statute[.]").

Separate opinion of Justice Stevens, in which Justice
Blackmun, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join.

Justice Thomas has written a separate opinion proposing
that the terms "standard, practice, or procedure" as used in
the Voting Rights Act of 1965 should henceforth be construed to refer only to practices that affect minority citizens'
access to the ballot. Specifically, Justice Thomas would no
longer interpret the Act to forbid practices that dilute minority voting strength. To the extent that his opinion advances
policy arguments in favor of that interpretation of the statute, it should be addressed to Congress, which has ample
power to amend the statute. To the extent that the opinion

Opinion of Stevens, J.
suggests that federal judges have an obligation to subscribeto the proposed narrow reading of statutory language, it is

appropriate to supplement Justice Thomas' writing with afew words of history.

I
Justice Thomas notes that the first generation of Voting
Rights Act cases focused on access to the ballot. Ante, at894-895. By doing so, he suggests that the early pattern of

enforcement is an indication of the original meaning of thestatute. In this regard, it is important to note that the
Court's first case addressing a voting practice other than access to the ballot arose under the Fifteenth Amendment. In
Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339 (1960), the Court held
that a change in the boundaries of the city of Tuskegee,Alabama, violated the Fifteenth Amendment. In his opinion for the Court, Justice Frankfurter wrote:

"The opposite conclusion, urged upon us by respondents,
would sanction the achievement by a State of any im-pairment of voting rights whatever so long as it was

cloaked in the garb of the realignment of political subdivisions." Id., at 345.

"A statute which is alleged to have worked unconstitutional deprivations of petitioners' rights is not immune
to attack simply because the mechanism employed by
the legislature is a redefinition of municipal boundaries.
According to the allegations here made, the Alabama
Legislature has not merely redrawn the Tuskegee city
limits with incidental inconvenience to the petitioners;
it is more accurate to say that it has deprived the petitioners of the municipal franchise and consequent rights
and to that end it has incidentally changed the city's
boundaries. While in form this is merely an act redefining metes and bounds, if the allegations are established, the inescapable human effect of this essay in
geometry and geography is to despoil colored citizens,

Opinion of Stevens, J.
and only colored citizens, of their theretofore enjoyed
voting rights." Id., at 347.1

Because Gomillion was decided only a few years before
the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed, and because coverage under the Voting Rights Act is generally coextensive
with or broader than coverage under the Fifteenth Amendment, see Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641 (1966); Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S. 55, 60-61 (1980) (plurality opinion),
it is surely not unreasonable to infer that Congress intended
the Act to reach the kind of voting practice that was at issue
in that case. Nevertheless, the text of the Act would also
have supported the opposite inference, because the language
of the Fifteenth Amendment would seem to forbid any denial
or abridgment of the right to vote, whereas $$ 2 and 5 of the
Voting Rights Act refer only to "voting qualification[s,] . . .
prerequisite[s] to voting, . . . standard[s], practice[s], [and]
procedure[s]."

During the years between 1965 and 1969 the question
whether the Voting Rights Act should be narrowly construed
to cover nothing more than impediments to access to the
ballot was an unresolved issue. What Justice Thomas describes as "a fundamental shift in the focal point of the Act,"
ante, at 895, occurred in 1969 when the Court unequivocally
rejected the narrow reading, relying heavily on a broad

1 In most of his opinion, Justice Thomas seems to use the phrase "access to the ballot" to refer to the voter's ability to cast a vote. In an
attempt to characterize the Gomillion gerrymander as a practice that
interfered with access to the ballot, however, he seems to take the position
that the redrawing of the boundaries of a governmental unit is a practice
that affects access to the ballot because some voters' ballots could not
thereafter be cast for the same offices as before. See ante, at 920, n. 20.
Under such reasoning the substitution of an appointive office for an elective office, see Bunton v. Patterson, decided with Allen v. State Bd. of
Elections, 393 U. S. 544, 550-551 (1969), or a change in district boundaries
that prevented voters from casting ballots for the reelection of their incumbent congressional Representatives, would also be covered practices.

definition of the term "voting" as including " `all action nec-essary to make a vote effective.' " Allen v. State Bd. of

Elections, 393 U. S. 544, 565-566.Despite Allen's purported deviation from the Act's true
meaning, Congress one year later reenacted $ 5 without inany way changing the operative words. During the next
five years, the Court consistently adhered to Allen, see Perkins v. Matthews, 400 U. S. 379 (1971); Georgia v. UnitedStates, 411 U. S. 526 (1973), and in 1975, Congress again reenacted $ 5 without change.When, in the late seventies, some parties advocated a narrow reading of the Act, the Court pointed to these congres-sional reenactments as solid evidence that

Allen, even if notcorrectly decided in 1969, would now be clearly correct. In

United States v. Sheffield Bd. of Comm'rs, 435 U. S. 110, 132-133 (1978), the Court noted:

"In 1970, Congress was clearly fully aware of thisCourt's interpretation of $ 5 as reaching voter changes
other than those affecting the registration process andplainly contemplated that the Act would continue to be
so construed. See, e. g., Hearings on H. R. 4249 et al.before Subcommittee No. 5 of the House Committee on
the Judiciary, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., 1, 4, 18, 83, 130-131,133, 147-149, 154-155, 182-184, 402-454 (1969); Hearings

Opinion of Stevens, J.
As the Court in that case also noted, when Congress reenacts a statute with knowledge of its prior interpretation, that
interpretation is binding on the Court.

"Whatever one might think of the other arguments
advanced, the legislative background of the 1975 reenactment is conclusive of the question before us.
When a Congress that re-enacts a statute voices its
approval of an administrative or other interpretation
thereof, Congress is treated as having adopted that
interpretation, and this Court is bound thereby. See,
e. g., Don E. Williams Co. v. Commissioner, 429 U. S.
569, 576-577 (1977); Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422
U. S. 405, 414 n. 8 (1975); H. Hart & A. Sacks, The Legal

Hazeltine Research, 401 U. S. 321, 336 n. 7 (1971); Girouard v. United States, 328 U. S. 61, 69-70 (1946). Don E.
Williams Co. v. Commissioner, supra, is instructive.

interpretation of a statute when Congress re-enacted it,
and there, as here, the legislative history of the reenactment showed that Congress agreed with that interchoice . . . .' 393 U. S., at 569. When it renewed the Voting Rights Act
in 1970 and again in 1975, Congress was well aware of the application of

$ 5 to redistricting. In its 1970 extension, Congress relied on findings by
the United States Commission on Civil Rights that the newly gained voting strength of minorities was in danger of being diluted by redistricting
plans that divided minority communities among predominantly white districts. In 1975, Congress was unmistakably cognizant of this new phase
in the effort to eliminate voting discrimination. Former Attorney General Katzenbach testified that $ 5 `has had its broadest impact . . . in the
areas of redistricting and reapportionment,' and the Senate and House
Reports recommending the extension of the Act referred specifically to
the Attorney General's role in screening redistricting plans to protect the
opportunities for nonwhites to be elected to public office" (footnote

If the 1970 and 1975 reenactments had left any doubt as
to congressional intent, that doubt would be set aside by the
1982 amendments to $ 2. Between 1975 and 1982, the Court
continued to interpret the Voting Rights Act in the broad
manner set out by Allen. See City of Rome v. United
States, 446 U. S. 156 (1980); Dougherty County Bd. of Ed.
v. White, 439 U. S. 32 (1978); United Jewish Organizations
of Williamsburgh, Inc. v. Carey, 430 U. S. 144 (1977); Richmond v. United States, 422 U. S. 358 (1975). In Mobile v.
Bolden, 446 U. S. 55 (1980), a plurality of this Court concluded that violations of both the Voting Rights Act and the
Fifteenth Amendment required discriminatory purpose.
The case involved a claim that at-large voting diluted minority voting strength. In his opinion for the plurality in
Bolden, Justice Stewart expressly relied upon Gomillion
v. Lightfoot's holding "that allegations of a racially motivated
gerrymander of municipal boundaries stated a claim under
the Fifteenth Amendment." 446 U. S., at 62; see also id., at
85-86 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). The only reason Gomillion did not control the outcome in Bolden was
that an "invidious purpose" had been alleged in the earlier
case but not in Bolden. 446 U. S., at 63.3 The congressional response to Bolden is familiar history. In the 1982
amendment to $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act, Congress substituted a "results" test for an intent requirement. Pub. L.
97-205, $ 3, 96 Stat. 134; see 42 U. S. C. $ 1973. It is crystal

3 The idea that the Court in Bolden cast doubt on whether the Voting
Rights Act reached diluting practices is flatly refuted by another decision
handed down the very same day as the Bolden decision. In City of Rome
v. United States, 446 U. S. 156, 186-187 (1980), the Court held that $ 5
required preclearance of annexations potentially diluting minority voting
strength. Even the dissenters did not suggest that vote dilution claims
were now questionable.

clear that Congress intended the 1982 amendment to covernonaccess claims like those in Bolden and Gomillion.

Justice Thomas' narrow interpretation of the words "vot-ing qualification . . . standard, practice, or procedure," if

adopted, would require us to overrule Allen and the casesthat have adhered to its reading of the critical statutory language. The radical character of that suggested interpreta-tion is illustrated by the following passage from an opinion
decided only nine years after Allen:

"The Court's decisions over the past 10 years havegiven $ 5 the broad scope suggested by the language of

the Act. We first construed it in Allen v. State Boardof Elections, [393 U. S. 544 (1969)]. There our examination of the Act's objectives and original legislative his-tory led us to interpret $ 5 to give it `the broadest possible scope,' 393 U. S., at 567, and to require prior federalscrutiny of `any state enactment which altered the election law in a covered State in even a minor way.' Id.,at 566. In so construing $ 5, we unanimously rejected--
as the plain terms of the Act would themselves haveseemingly required--the argument of an appellee that

$ 5 should apply only to enactments affecting who mayregister to vote. 393 U. S., at 564. Our decisions have
required federal preclearance of laws changing the loca-tion of polling places, see Perkins v. Matthews, 400 U. S.

4 We recently confirmed that interpretation of the 1982 amendment, stating: "Moreover, there is no question that the terms `standard, practice, or
procedure' are broad enough to encompass the use of multimember districts to minimize a racial minority's ability to influence the outcome of an
election covered by $ 2." Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U. S. 380, 390 (1991).
Though disagreeing with the Court's holding that the statute covered
judicial elections, even the dissenters in that case agreed that the
amended $ 2 "extends to vote dilution claims for the elections of representatives . . . ." Id., at 405.

The Allen interpretation of the Act has also been followed ina host of cases decided in later years, among them Houston

Opinion of Stevens, J.
507 U. S. 25 (1993); City of Lockhart v. United States, 460
U. S. 125 (1983).

The large number of decisions that we would have to overrule or reconsider, as well as the congressional reenactments
discussed above, suggests that Justice Thomas' radical reinterpretation of the Voting Rights Act is barred by the
well-established principle that stare decisis has special force
in the statutory arena. Ankenbrandt v. Richards, 504 U. S.
689, 700 (1992); Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S.
164, 171-172 (1989); Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S.
720, 736-737 (1977).

Justice Thomas attempts to minimize the radical implications of his interpretation of the phrase "voting qualification
. . . standard, practice, or procedure" by noting that this case
involves only the interpretation of $ 2 of the Voting Rights
Act. Section 5, he hints, might be interpreted differently.
Even limiting the reinterpretation to $ 2 cases, however,
would require overruling a sizable number of this Court's
precedents. Houston Lawyers' Assn. v. Attorney General
of Tex., 501 U. S. 419 (1991); Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U. S. 380
(1991); Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30 (1986); see also
Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146 (1993); Growe v. Emison,
507 U. S. 25 (1993). In addition, a distinction between $$ 2
and 5 is difficult to square with the language of the statute.
Sections 2 and 5 contain exactly the same words: "voting
qualification . . . standard, practice, or procedure." If anything, the wording of $ 5 is narrower, because it adds the
limiting phrase "with respect to voting" after the word "procedure." Moreover, when Congress amended the Voting
Rights Act in 1982 in response to Bolden, it amended $ 2.
As noted above, in those amendments Congress clearly endorsed the application of the Voting Rights Act to vote dilution claims. While a distinction between $$ 2 and 5 might
be supportable on policy grounds, it is an odd distinction for
devotees of "plain language" interpretation.

966 HOLDER v. HALL

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Throughout his opinion, Justice Thomas argues that thiscase is an exception to stare decisis, because Allen and its

progeny have "immersed the federal courts in a hopelessproject of weighing questions of political theory." Ante, at
892. There is no question that the Voting Rights Act hasrequired the courts to resolve difficult questions, but that is
no reason to deviate from an interpretation that Congresshas thrice approved. Statutes frequently require courts to
make policy judgments. The Sherman Act, for example, re-quires courts to delve deeply into the theory of economic
organization. Similarly, Title VII of the Civil Rights Acthas required the courts to formulate a theory of equal opportunity. Our work would certainly be much easier if everycase could be resolved by consulting a dictionary, but when
Congress has legislated in general terms, judges may notinvoke judicial modesty to avoid difficult questions.

III
When a statute has been authoritatively, repeatedly, andconsistently construed for more than a quarter century, and

when Congress has reenacted and extended the statute sev-eral times with full awareness of that construction, judges
have an especially clear obligation to obey settled law.Whether

Justice Thomas is correct that the Court's settledconstruction of the Voting Rights Act has been "a disastrous

misadventure," ante, at 893, should not affect the decision inthis case. It is therefore inappropriate for me to comment
on the portions of his opinion that are best described as anargument that the statute be repealed or amended in important respects.

TUILAEPA v. CALIFORNIA
certiorari to the supreme court of california

No. 93-5131. Argued March 22, 1994--Decided June 30, 1994*
A defendant in California is eligible for the death penalty when a jury

finds him guilty of first-degree murder and finds one or more of the
special circumstances listed in Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 190.2. The case
then proceeds to the penalty phase, where the jury is instructed to
consider numerous other factors listed in $ 190.3 in deciding whether
to impose death. Petitioners Tuilaepa and Proctor were convicted of
first-degree murder in separate cases. At the penalty phase of each
trial, the jury was instructed to consider the relevant sentencing factors
in $ 190.3. Both petitioners were sentenced to death, and the State
Supreme Court affirmed. Here, they challenge the constitutionality of
penalty-phase factor (a), which requires the sentencer to consider the
"circumstances of the crime of which the defendant was convicted . . .
and the existence of any special circumstances found to be true." Tuilaepa also challenges factor (b), which requires the sentencer to consider
the "presence or absence of criminal activity [involving] the use or attempted use of force or violence or the express or implied threat to use
force or violence," and factor (i), which requires the sentencer to consider the defendant's age at the time of the crime.

Held: The factors in question are not unconstitutionally vague under

this Court's decisions construing the Cruel and Unusual Punishments
Clause. Pp. 971-980.

(a) The Court's vagueness review is quite deferential, and relies on
the basic principle that a factor is not unconstitutional if it has some
"common-sense core of meaning . . . that criminal juries should be capable of understanding." Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262, 279 (White, J.,
concurring in judgment). Petitioners' challenge to factor (a) is at some
odds with settled principles, for the circumstances of the crime are a
traditional subject for consideration by the sentencer, see, e. g., Woodson
v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, 304 (plurality opinion), and factor (a)
instructs the jury in understandable terms. Factor (b) is framed in
conventional and understandable terms as well. Asking a jury to consider matters of historical fact is a permissible part of the sentencing
process. Tuilaepa's challenge to factor (i) is also unusual in light of the

*Together with No. 93-5161, Proctor v. California, also on certiorari to
the same court.

Court's precedents. See Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 115-117.
While determining the bearing age ought to have in fixing the penalty
can pose a dilemma for the jury, difficulty in application is not the equivalent of vagueness. Pp. 971-977.

(b) This Court's precedents also foreclose petitioners' remaining arguments. Selection factors need not require answers to factual questions.
The States are not confined to submitting to the jury specific propositional questions, see, e. g., Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 878-880, 889,
and there is no constitutional problem where an instruction directs consideration of a crime's facts and circumstances. Nor must a capital sentencer be instructed how to weigh any particular fact in the sentencing
decision. See, e. g., California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992, 1008-1009.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
In California, to sentence a defendant to death for firstdegree murder the trier of fact must find the defendant
guilty and also find one or more of 19 special circumstances
listed in Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 190.2 (West 1988 and Supp.
1994). The case then proceeds to the penalty phase, where
the trier of fact must consider a number of specified factors
in deciding whether to sentence the defendant to death.

$ 190.3.* These two cases present the question whether
three of the $ 190.3 penalty-phase factors are unconstitutionally vague under decisions of this Court construing the

*Section 190.3 provides in part:
"In determining the penalty, the trier of fact shall take into account any
of the following factors if relevant:

"(a) The circumstances of the crime of which the defendant was convicted in the present proceeding and the existence of any special circumstances found to be true pursuant to Section 190.1.

"(b) The presence or absence of criminal activity by the defendant
which involved the use or attempted use of force or violence or the express
or implied threat to use force or violence.

"(c) The presence or absence of any prior felony conviction.
"(d) Whether or not the offense was committed while the defendant was
under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance.

"(e) Whether or not the victim was a participant in the defendant's homicidal conduct or consented to the homicidal act.

"(f) Whether or not the offense was committed under circumstances
which the defendant reasonably believed to be a moral justification or
extenuation for his conduct.

"(g) Whether or not defendant acted under extreme duress or under
the substantial domination of another person.

"(h) Whether or not at the time of the offense the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was impaired as a result of mental disease
or defect, or the [e]ffects of intoxication.

"(i) The age of the defendant at the time of the crime.
"(j) Whether or not the defendant was an accomplice to the offense and
his participation in the commission of the offense was relatively minor.

"(k) Any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime
even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime."

970 TUILAEPA v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the EighthAmendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. I

Petitioner Tuilaepa's case arises out of a murder he com-mitted in Long Beach, California, in October 1986. Tuilaepa
and an accomplice walked into the Wander Inn Bar in LongBeach, where a small crowd had gathered to watch Monday
Night Football. Tuilaepa, who was carrying a .22-caliberrifle, approached the bartender, pointed the rifle at him, and
demanded money from the cash register. After the bar-tender turned over the money, Tuilaepa and his accomplice
began robbing the bar's patrons. When the accomplice de-manded money from a man named Melvin Whiddon, Whiddon refused and knocked the accomplice to the floor. Tui-laepa shot Whiddon in the neck and next shot Whiddon's
brother, Kelvin, who was standing nearby. Tuilaepa turnedto another man, Bruce Monroe, and shot him in the stomach.
As Tuilaepa and his accomplice ran toward the back door,they confronted Kenneth Boone. Tuilaepa shot Boone in the
neck. Melvin Whiddon died at the scene from the gunshotwounds; the others suffered serious and in some cases permanent injuries.The State sought the death penalty against Tuilaepa,
charging him with the murder of Melvin Whiddon and onespecial circumstance under $ 190.2: murder during the commission of a robbery. The jury found Tuilaepa guilty offirst-degree murder and also found the special circumstance
true. At the penalty phase, the trial judge instructed thejury to consider the relevant sentencing factors specified in

$ 190.3. The jury was unanimous in sentencing Tuilaepa todeath.

Petitioner Proctor murdered Bonnie Stendal, a 55-year-oldschoolteacher who lived in Burney, a small community in
Shasta County, California. On a night in April 1982, Proctorentered Mrs. Stendal's home and beat her, causing numerous

cuts and bruises on her face. Proctor stabbed Mrs. Stendalin the neck several times and inflicted seven stab wounds in

the area of the right breast. Proctor raped Mrs. Stendaland committed further sexual assaults with a foreign object.
After beating, torturing, and raping Mrs. Stendal, Proctorstrangled her to death and dumped her body on the side of
the road near Lake Britton, 12 miles from Burney. Thebody was found late the next afternoon, clad in a nightgown
with hands tied behind the back.The State sought the death penalty against Proctor, charging him with murder and a number of special circumstancesunder $ 190.2 including murder during the commission of a
rape, murder during the commission of a burglary, and in-fliction of torture during a murder. The jury found Proctor
guilty of murder and found the three special circumstancestrue. After a mistrial at the penalty phase, Proctor's motion for change of venue was granted, and a new sentencingjury was empaneled in Sacramento County. The trial judge
instructed the jury to consider the sentencing factors speci-fied in $ 190.3. The jury was unanimous in sentencing Proctor to death.Petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court of California,
which affirmed their convictions and death sentences.No. 93-5131, 4 Cal. 4th 569, 842 P. 2d 1142 (1992), and

A

Our capital punishment cases under the Eighth Amend-ment address two different aspects of the capital decisionmaking process: the eligibility decision and the selection de-cision. To be eligible for the death penalty, the defendant
must be convicted of a crime for which the death penalty isa proportionate punishment.

Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584(1977). To render a defendant eligible for the death penalty

512us3$95l 12-28-97 17:51:10 PAGES OPINPGT
972 TUILAEPA v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
in a homicide case, we have indicated that the trier of fact
must convict the defendant of murder and find one "aggravating circumstance" (or its equivalent) at either the guilt or
penalty phase. See, e. g., Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U. S.
231, 244-246 (1988); Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 878
(1983). The aggravating circumstance may be contained in
the definition of the crime or in a separate sentencing factor
(or in both). Lowenfield, supra, at 244-246. As we have
explained, the aggravating circumstance must meet two requirements. First, the circumstance may not apply to every
defendant convicted of a murder; it must apply only to a subclass of defendants convicted of murder. See Arave v.
Creech, 507 U. S. 463, 474 (1993) ("If the sentencer fairly
could conclude that an aggravating circumstance applies to
every defendant eligible for the death penalty, the circumstance is constitutionally infirm"). Second, the aggravating
circumstance may not be unconstitutionally vague. Godfrey
v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420, 428 (1980); see Arave, supra, at 471
(court " `must first determine whether the statutory language defining the circumstance is itself too vague to provide
any guidance to the sentencer' ") (quoting Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 654 (1990)).

We have imposed a separate requirement for the selection
decision, where the sentencer determines whether a defendant eligible for the death penalty should in fact receive that
sentence. "What is important at the selection stage is an
individualized determination on the basis of the character
of the individual and the circumstances of the crime." Zant,
supra, at 879; see also Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S.
280, 303-304 (1976) (plurality opinion). That requirement is
met when the jury can consider relevant mitigating evidence
of the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of the crime. Blystone v. Pennsylvania, 494 U. S.
299, 307 (1990) ("requirement of individualized sentencing in
capital cases is satisfied by allowing the jury to consider all

512us3$95l 12-28-97 17:51:10 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
relevant mitigating evidence"); see Johnson v. Texas, 509U. S. 350, 361 (1993).

The eligibility decision fits the crime within a defined clas-sification. Eligibility factors almost of necessity require an
answer to a question with a factual nexus to the crime or
the defendant so as to "make rationally reviewable the proc-ess for imposing a sentence of death."

Arave, supra, at 471
(internal quotation marks omitted). The selection decision,on the other hand, requires individualized sentencing and

must be expansive enough to accommodate relevant mitigat-ing evidence so as to assure an assessment of the defendant's
culpability. The objectives of these two inquiries can be in
some tension, at least when the inquiries occur at the same
time. See Romano v. Oklahoma, ante, at 6 (referring to
"two somewhat contradictory tasks"). There is one principle common to both decisions, however: The State must ensure that the process is neutral and principled so as to guard
against bias or caprice in the sentencing decision. See
Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 189 (1976) ( joint opinion of
Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) (procedures must "minimize the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action").
That is the controlling objective when we examine eligibility and selection factors for vagueness. Indeed, it is the
reason that eligibility and selection factors (at least in some
sentencing schemes) may not be "too vague." Walton,
supra, at 654; see Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356,
361-364 (1988).

Because "the proper degree of definition" of eligibility and
selection factors often "is not susceptible of mathematical
precision," our vagueness review is quite deferential. Walton, supra, at 655; see Gregg, supra, at 193-194 (factors "are
by necessity somewhat general"). Relying on the basic
principle that a factor is not unconstitutional if it has some
"common-sense core of meaning . . . that criminal juries
should be capable of understanding," Jurek v. Texas, 428
U. S. 262, 279 (1976) (White, J., concurring in judgment), we

Opinion of the Court
have found only a few factors vague, and those in factare quite similar to one another. See

363-364 (question whether murder was "especially heinous,atrocious, or cruel");

Godfrey, supra, at 427-429 (question
whether murder was "outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman"); cf. Arave, 507 U. S., at 472 ("We are notfaced with pejorative adjectives . . . that describe a crime as

a whole"). In providing for individualized sentencing, itmust be recognized that the States may adopt capital sentencing processes that rely upon the jury, in its sound judg-ment, to exercise wide discretion. That is evident from the
numerous factors we have upheld against vagueness challenges. See, e. g., id., at 472-473 (question whether the defendant was a "cold-blooded, pitiless slayer" is not unconstitutionally vague); Walton, supra, at 654 (question whether
"perpetrator inflict[ed] mental anguish or physical abuse before the victim's death" with "[m]ental anguish includ[ing] a
victim's uncertainty as to his ultimate fate" is not unconstitutionally vague) (internal quotation marks omitted); Proffitt
v. Florida, 428 U. S. 242, 255-258 (1976) ( joint opinion of
Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) (various "mitigating"
questions not unconstitutionally vague, nor is the question
whether the crime was a "conscienceless or pitiless crime
which [wa]s unnecessarily torturous to the victim") (internal
quotation marks omitted); Jurek, supra, at 274-276 (question
"whether there is a probability that the defendant would
commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society" is not unconstitutionally vague).

In our decisions holding a death sentence unconstitutional
because of a vague sentencing factor, the State had presented a specific proposition that the sentencer had to find
true or false (e. g., whether the crime was especially heinous,
atrocious, or cruel). We have held, under certain sentencing
schemes, that a vague propositional factor used in the sentencing decision creates an unacceptable risk of randomness,
the mark of the arbitrary and capricious sentencing process

prohibited by Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972). SeeStringer v. Black, 503 U. S. 222 (1992). Those concerns are

mitigated when a factor does not require a yes or a noanswer to a specific question, but instead only points the
sentencer to a subject matter. See Cal. Penal Code Ann.$$ 190.3(a), (k) (West 1988). Both types of factors (and the
distinction between the two is not always clear) have theirutility. For purposes of vagueness analysis, however, in examining the propositional content of a factor, our concern isthat the factor have some "common-sense core of meaning
. . . that criminal juries should be capable of understanding."
Jurek, supra, at 279 (White, J., concurring in judgment).

B
With those principles in mind, we consider petitioners'vagueness challenge to the California scheme. A defendant

in California is eligible for the death penalty when the juryfinds him guilty of first-degree murder and finds one of
the $ 190.2 special circumstances true. See California v.Ramos, 463 U. S. 992, 1008 (1983) ( jury found that "the defendant [fell] within the legislatively defined category of per-sons eligible for the death penalty [by] determining the truth
of the alleged special circumstance," commission of murderduring the course of a robbery). (Petitioners do not argue
that the special circumstances found in their cases wereinsufficient, so we do not address that part of California's
scheme save to describe its relation to the selection phase.)At the penalty phase, the jury is instructed to consider numerous other factors listed in $ 190.3 in deciding whether toimpose the death penalty on a particular defendant. Petitioners contend that three of those $ 190.3 sentencing factors areunconstitutional and that, as a consequence, it was error to
instruct their juries to consider them. Both Proctor and Tu-ilaepa challenge factor (a), which requires the sentencer to
consider the "circumstances of the crime of which the defend-ant was convicted in the present proceeding and the exist512US3 Unit: $U95 [01-06-00 06:39:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN
976 TUILAEPA v. CALIFORNIA

Opinion of the Court
ence of any special circumstances found to be true." Tui-laepa challenges two other factors as well: factor (b), which

requires the sentencer to consider "[t]he presence or absenceof criminal activity by the defendant which involved the use
or attempted use of force or violence or the express or
implied threat to use force or violence"; and factor (i),which requires the sentencer to consider "[t]he age of the

defendant at the time of the crime." We conclude thatnone of the three factors is defined in terms that violate
the Constitution.Petitioners' challenge to factor (a) is at some odds with
settled principles, for our capital jurisprudence has established that the sentencer should consider the circumstances
of the crime in deciding whether to impose the death penalty.
See, e. g., Woodson, 428 U. S., at 304 ("[C]onsideration of . . .
the circumstances of the particular offense [is] a constitutionally indispensable part of the process of inflicting the penalty
of death"). We would be hard pressed to invalidate a jury
instruction that implements what we have said the law requires. In any event, this California factor instructs the
jury to consider a relevant subject matter and does so in
understandable terms. The circumstances of the crime are
a traditional subject for consideration by the sentencer, and
an instruction to consider the circumstances is neither vague
nor otherwise improper under our Eighth Amendment
jurisprudence.

Tuilaepa also challenges factor (b), which requires the sentencer to consider the defendant's prior criminal activity.
The objection fails for many of the same reasons. Factor (b)
is phrased in conventional and understandable terms and
rests in large part on a determination whether certain
events occurred, thus asking the jury to consider matters of
historical fact. Under other sentencing schemes, in Texas
for example, jurors may be asked to make a predictive judgment, such as "whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would

Opinion of the Court
constitute a continuing threat to society." See Jurek, 428U. S., at 269. Both a backward-looking and a forwardlooking inquiry are a permissible part of the sentencing proc-ess, however, and the States have considerable latitude in
determining how to guide the sentencer's decision in thisrespect. Here, factor (b) is not vague.

Tuilaepa's third challenge is to factor (i), which requiresthe sentencer to consider "[t]he age of the defendant at the
time of the crime." This again is an unusual challenge inlight of our precedents. See

Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455U. S. 104, 115-117 (1982) (age may be relevant factor in sentencing decision). The factual inquiry is of the most rudi-mentary sort, and there is no suggestion that the term "age"
is vague. Petitioner contends, however, that the age factoris equivocal and that in the typical case the prosecution argues in favor of the death penalty based on the defendant'sage, no matter how old or young he was at the time of the
crime. It is neither surprising nor remarkable that the rele-vance of the defendant's age can pose a dilemma for the sentencer. But difficulty in application is not equivalent tovagueness. Both the prosecution and the defense may present valid arguments as to the significance of the defendant'sage in a particular case. Competing arguments by adversary parties bring perspective to a problem, and thus serveto promote a more reasoned decision, providing guidance as
to a factor jurors most likely would discuss in any event.We find no constitutional deficiency in factor (i).

C
Petitioners could not and do not take great issue with theconclusion that factors (a), (b), and (i) provide common and

understandable terms to the sentencer. Cf. Godfrey, 446U. S., at 429 ("jury's interpretation of [outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman factor] can only be the sub-ject of sheer speculation"). Petitioners argue, however, that
selection factors must meet the requirements for eligibility

Opinion of the Court
factors, Brief for Petitioner in No. 93-5161, pp. 10-25, andtherefore must require an answer to a factual question, as

eligibility factors do. According to petitioners, a capitaljury may not be instructed simply to consider an open-ended
subject matter, such as "the circumstances of the crime" or
"the background of the defendant." Apart from the factthat petitioners' argument ignores the obvious utility of

these open-ended factors as part of a neutral sentencingprocess, it contravenes our precedents. Our decisions in
Zant and Gregg reveal that, at the selection stage, the Statesare not confined to submitting to the jury specific propositional questions. In Zant, we found no constitutional difficulty where the jury had been told to consider " `all facts
and circumstances presented in extenuation, mitigation, and
aggravation of punishment as well as such arguments as
have been presented for the State and for the Defense.' "
462 U. S., at 878-880, 889, n. 25. We also stated that "[n]othing in the United States Constitution prohibits a trial judge
from instructing a jury that it would be appropriate to take
account of a defendant's prior criminal record in making its
sentencing determination." Id., at 888. And in Gregg, we
rejected a vagueness challenge to that same Georgia sentencing scheme in a case in which the "judge . . . charged the
jury that in determining what sentence was appropriate the
jury was free to consider the facts and circumstances, if any,
presented by the parties in mitigation or aggravation." 428
U. S., at 161, 203-204. In both cases, therefore, the Court
found no constitutional problem with a death sentence where
the jury instructions directed consideration of the "facts and
circumstances" of the case. In these cases as well, we must
reject petitioners' suggestion that the Constitution prohibits
sentencing instructions that require the trier of fact to consider a relevant subject matter such as the "circumstances
of the crime."

Petitioners also suggest that the $ 190.3 sentencing factors
are flawed because they do not instruct the sentencer how to

Opinion of the Court
weigh any of the facts it finds in deciding upon the ultimatesentence. In this regard, petitioners claim that a single list

of factors is unconstitutional because it does not guide thejury in evaluating and weighing the evidence and allows the
prosecution (as well as the defense) to make wide-ranging
arguments about whether the defendant deserves the deathpenalty. This argument, too, is foreclosed by our cases. A

capital sentencer need not be instructed how to weigh anyparticular fact in the capital sentencing decision. In

California v. Ramos, for example, we upheld an instruction in-forming the jury that the Governor had the power to commute life sentences and stated that "the fact that the jury is
given no specific guidance on how the commutation factor
is to figure into its determination presents no constitutional
problem." 463 U. S., at 1008-1009, n. 22. Likewise, in
Proffitt v. Florida, we upheld the Florida capital sentencing
scheme even though "the various factors to be considered by
the sentencing authorities [did] not have numerical weights
assigned to them." 428 U. S., at 258. In Gregg, moreover,
we "approved Georgia's capital sentencing statute even
though it clearly did not channel the jury's discretion by
enunciating specific standards to guide the jury's consideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances." Zant,
462 U. S., at 875. We also rejected an objection "to the wide
scope of evidence and argument" allowed at sentencing hearings. 428 U. S., at 203-204. In sum, "discretion to evaluate
and weigh the circumstances relevant to the particular defendant and the crime he committed" is not impermissible in
the capital sentencing process. McCleskey v. Kemp, 481
U. S. 279, 315, n. 37 (1987). "Once the jury finds that the
defendant falls within the legislatively defined category of
persons eligible for the death penalty, . . . the jury then is
free to consider a myriad of factors to determine whether
death is the appropriate punishment." Ramos, supra, at
1008. Indeed, the sentencer may be given "unbridled discretion in determining whether the death penalty should be

imposed after it has found that the defendant is a memberof the class made eligible for that penalty."

Zant, supra, at
875; see also Barclay v. Florida, 463 U. S. 939, 948-951 (1983)(plurality opinion). In contravention of those cases, petitioners' argument would force the States to adopt a kind of
mandatory sentencing scheme requiring a jury to sentence adefendant to death if it found, for example, a certain kind or

number of facts, or found more statutory aggravating factorsthan statutory mitigating factors. The States are not required to conduct the capital sentencing process in that fash-ion. See

Gregg, supra, at 199-200, n. 50.
The instructions to the juries in petitioners' cases direct-ing consideration of factor (a), factor (b), and factor (i) did

not violate the Constitution. The judgments of the Supreme Court of California are

Affirmed.

Justice Scalia, concurring.
It is my view that once a State has adopted a methodology
to narrow the eligibility for the death penalty, thereby ensuring that its imposition is not "freakish," Wainwright v.
Goode, 464 U. S. 78, 87 (1983) (per curiam), the distinctive
procedural requirements of the Eighth Amendment have
been exhausted. See Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 669-
673 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in
judgment). Today's decision adheres to our cases which acknowledge additional requirements, but since it restricts
their further expansion it moves in the right direction. For
that reason, and without abandoning my prior views, I join
the opinion of the Court.

Justice Souter, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion because it correctly recognizes
that factors adequate to perform the function of genuine narrowing, as well as factors that otherwise guide the jury in
selecting which defendants receive the death penalty, are not

susceptible to mathematical precision; they must depend fortheir requisite clarity on embodying a "common-sense core

of meaning," as Justice White put it in Jurek v. Texas, 428U. S. 262, 279 (1976) (concurring opinion). Taking factor (b)
to be essentially propositional, as the Court uses the term,
ante, at 974-975, I find it is sufficiently clear to pass muster;and I agree with the Court's analysis of factor (i) and the

challenged portion of factor (a), neither of which is framedas a proposition.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,
concurring in the judgment.

As these cases come to us they present a question that the
Court answered in Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862 (1983).California, like Georgia, has provided a procedure for determining whether a defendant found guilty of murder is eligible for the death penalty. Petitioners have not challenged
the constitutionality of that procedure or its application in
these cases. Accordingly, our decision rests on the same assumption that we made in Zant, namely, that the statutory
procedure for determining eligibility adequately confines the
class of persons eligible for the death penalty to a narrow
category in which there is a special justification for "the
imposition of a more severe sentence on the defendant
compared to others found guilty of murder." Id., at 877.

The question is whether, in addition to adequately narrowing the class of death-eligible defendants, the State must
channel the jury's sentencing discretion when it is deciding
whether to impose the death sentence on an eligible defendant by requiring the trial judge to characterize relevant sentencing factors as aggravating or mitigating. In Zant we
held that the incorrect characterization of a relevant factor
as an aggravating factor did not prejudice the defendant; it
follows, I believe, that the failure to characterize factors such
as the age of the defendant or the circumstances of the crime
as either aggravating or mitigating is also unobjectionable.

982 TUILAEPA v. CALIFORNIA

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
Indeed, I am persuaded that references to such potentiallyambiguous, but clearly relevant, factors actually reduces the

risk of arbitrary capital sentencing.Prior to the Court's decision in

Furman v. Georgia, 408
U. S. 238 (1972), in a number of States the death penalty was
authorized not only for all first-degree murders, but for less
serious offenses such as rape, armed robbery, and kidnaping
as well. Moreover, juries had virtually unbridled discretion
in determining whether a human life should be taken or
spared. The risk of arbitrary and capricious sentencing,
specifically including the danger that racial prejudice would
determine the fate of the defendant,* persuaded a majority of the Court in Furman that such capital sentencing
schemes were unconstitutional. The two principal protections against such arbitrary sentencing that have been endorsed in our subsequent jurisprudence focus, respectively,
on the eligibility determination and the actual sentencing
decision.

First, as Chief Justice Rehnquist writing for the Court
in Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U. S. 231 (1988), succinctly
stated: "To pass constitutional muster, a capital sentencing
scheme must `genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible
for the death penalty and must reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence on the defendant compared to
others found guilty of murder.' " Id., at 244 (quoting Zant
v. Stephens, 462 U. S., at 877). When only a narrow subclass
of murderers can be subjected to the death penalty, the risk
of cruel and unusual punishment--either because it is disproportionate to the severity of the offense or because its imposition may be influenced by unacceptable factors--is diminished. See McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U. S. 279, 367 (1987)
(Stevens, J., dissenting). Because those risks can never be
entirely eliminated, however, the Court has identified an ad*See Justice Douglas' concurring opinion, 408 U. S., at 249-251.

ditional safeguard to protect death-eligible defendants from
the arbitrary imposition of the extreme penalty.

In Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 602-605 (1978), Chief Justice Burger emphasized the importance of requiring the jury
to make an individualized determination on the basis of the
character of the individual and the circumstances of the
crime. Insisting that the jury have an opportunity to consider all evidence relevant to a fair sentencing decision reduces the danger that they might otherwise rely on an irrelevant and improper consideration such as the race of the
defendant. In Zant, even though the trial judge had incorrectly characterized the defendant's prior history of "assaultive offenses" as a statutory aggravating circumstance, we
found no constitutional error because the evidence supporting that characterization was relevant and admissible. 462
U. S., at 887-889. We made it clear, however, that it would
be error for a State to attach the "aggravating" label to, or
otherwise authorize the jury to draw adverse inferences
from, "factors that are constitutionally impermissible or totally irrelevant to the sentencing process, such as for example the race, religion, or political affiliation of the defendant."
Id., at 885.

The three penalty-phase factors in California's statute that
are challenged in these cases do not violate that command.
Matters such as the age of the defendant at the time of the
crime, the circumstances of the crime, and the presence or
absence of force or violence are, in my opinion, relevant to
an informed, individualized sentencing decision. Under
Lockett, the defendant has a right to have the sentencer consider favorable evidence on each of these subjects, and under
Zant it is permissible for the prosecutor to adduce unfavorable evidence on the same subjects. If, as we held in Zant,
it is not constitutional error for the trial judge to place an
incorrect label on the prosecutor's evidence, it necessarily
follows that refusing to characterize ambiguous evidence as

512us3$95i 12-28-97 17:51:10 PAGES OPINPGT
984 TUILAEPA v. CALIFORNIA

Blackmun, J., dissenting
mitigating or aggravating is also constitutionally permissi-ble. Indeed, as I have indicated, I think the identification of

additional factors that are relevant to the sentencing decisionreduces the danger that a juror may vote in favor of the
death penalty because he or she harbors a prejudice againsta class of which the defendant is a member.

Accordingly, given the assumption (unchallenged by thesepetitioners) that California has a statutory "scheme" that
complies with the narrowing requirement defined in Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U. S., at 244, I conclude that the sentenc-ing factors at issue in these cases are consistent with the

defendant's constitutional entitlement to an individualized"determination that death is the appropriate punishment in
a specific case." Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280,305 (1976) (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and

Stevens, JJ.).

Justice Blackmun, dissenting.
Adhering to my view that the death penalty cannot beimposed fairly within the constraints of our Constitution, see

Callins v. Collins, 510 U. S. 1141, 1143 (1994), I would vacatepetitioners' death sentences. Even if I did not hold this
view, I would find that the three challenged factors do notwithstand a meaningful vagueness analysis because "as a
practical matter [they] fail to guide the sentencer's discre-tion." Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S. 222, 235 (1992).

I
A

The California capital punishment scheme does more thansimply direct the sentencing jurors' attention to certain subject matters. It lists 11 factors and authorizes the jury totreat any of them as aggravating circumstances to be placed
on death's side of the scale. Jurors are instructed that they"shall impose a death sentence if [they] conclud[e] that the
aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circum-stances." Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 190.3 (West 1988). De512us3$95f 12-28-97 17:51:10 PAGES OPINPGT

Blackmun, J., dissenting
spite the critical--even decisive--role these factors play inthe determination of who actually receives the death penalty,

jurors are given no guidance in how to consider them. Wehave stated: "A vague aggravating factor used in the weighing process . . . creates the risk that the jury will treat the
defendant as more deserving of the death penalty than hemight otherwise be by relying upon the existence of an illusory circumstance." Stringer, 503 U. S., at 235.The majority introduces a novel distinction between
"propositional" and "nonpropositional" aggravating circum-stances.

Ante, at 974. The majority acknowledges that the
"distinction between the two is not always clear," ante, at975; I find it largely illusory. The Court suggests, but does

not make explicit, that propositional factors are those that
"require a yes or a no answer to a specific question," whilenonpropositional factors are those that "only poin[t] the sentencer to a subject matter." Ibid. Presumably, then, asking the jury whether "the murder was especially heinous,
atrocious, or cruel" would be a propositional aggravator,
while directing the sentencer to "the presence or absence
of any especial heinousness, atrocity, or cruelty" would be a
nonpropositional factor. I am at a loss to see how the mere
rephrasing does anything more to channel or guide jury discretion. Nor does this propositional/nonpropositional distinction appear to play any role in the Court's decision. The
Court nowhere discloses specifically where the line is drawn,
on which side of it the three challenged factors fall, and what
relevance, if any, this distinction should have to the Court's
future vagueness analysis.1

1 Nor does it matter for Eighth Amendment purposes that California
uses one set of factors (the $ 190.2 "special circumstances") to determine
eligibility and another set (the $ 190.3 "relevant factors") in the weighing
or selection process. Whether an aggravator is used for narrowing, or
for weighing, or for both, it cannot be impermissibly vague. See Arave
v. Creech, 507 U. S. 463 (1993) (vagueness analysis applied to aggravating

Blackmun, J., dissenting
The more relevant distinction is not how an aggravating
factor is presented, but what the sentencer is told to do with
it. Where, as in Georgia, "aggravating factors as such have
no specific function in the jury's decision whether a defendant who has been found to be eligible for the death penalty
should receive it under all the circumstances of the case,"
Stringer, 503 U. S., at 229-230, we have not subjected aggravating circumstances to a vagueness analysis. See Zant v.
Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 873-874 (1983). In California, by
contrast, where the sentencer is instructed to weigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, a vague aggravator
creates the risk of an arbitrary thumb on death's side of the
scale, so we analyze aggravators for clarity, objectivity, and
principled guidance. See Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S.
356 (1988); Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420 (1980); see also
Pensinger v. California, 502 U. S. 930, 931 (1991) (O'Connor, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (observing that
California, like Mississippi, "requires its juries to weigh
aggravating and mitigating circumstances"); Stringer, 503
U. S., at 231 (difference between "nonweighing" States like
Georgia and "weighing" States like California is "not one of
`semantics' ") (citation omitted).

Each of the challenged California factors "leave[s] the sentencer without sufficient guidance for determining the presence or absence of the factor." Espinosa v. Florida, 505
U. S. 1079, 1081 (1992). Each of the three--circumstances
of the crime, age, and prior criminal activity--has been
exploited to convince jurors that just about anything is
aggravating.

Prosecutors have argued, and jurors are free to find, that
"circumstances of the crime" constitutes an aggravating factor because the defendant killed the victim for some purporteligible); Sochor v. Florida, 504 U. S. 527 (1992) (same); Walton v. Arizona,
497 U. S. 639 (1990) (same). The Court recognizes as much by subjecting
the challenged factors to a vagueness analysis.

the killing was an aggravating factor, because the victim waskilled in her own home, in a public bar, in a city park, or in

a remote location.14 In short, because neither the CaliforniaLegislature nor the California courts ever have articulated
a limiting construction of this term, prosecutors have beenpermitted to use the "circumstances of the crime" as an aggravating factor to embrace the entire spectrum of factspresent in virtually every homicide--something this Court
condemned in Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420 (1980). See
Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S., at 363 (the Court "plainlyrejected the submission that a particular set of facts surrounding a murder, however shocking they might be, wereenough in themselves, and without some narrowing principle
to apply to those facts, to warrant the imposition of thedeath penalty").

15

The defendant's age as a factor, applied inconsistently anderratically, similarly fails to channel the jurors' discretion.

In practice, prosecutors and trial judges have applied thisfactor to defendants of virtually every age: in their teens,
twenties, thirties, forties, and fifties at the time of the
No. S004607, ibid. (stabbing); People v. Scott, Cal. Sup. Ct. No. S010334,

Comtois, Cal. Sup. Ct. No. S017116, ibid. (remote, isolated location).

15 Although we have required that jurors be allowed to consider "as a

mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant's character or record and any
of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis
for a sentence less than death," Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604 (1978)
(emphasis in original), we have never approved such unrestricted consideration of a circumstance in aggravation. Similarly, while we approved the
Georgia capital sentencing scheme, which permits jurors to consider all
the circumstances of the offense and the offender, we did so in the context
of a system in which aggravators performed no function beyond the eligibility decision. See Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 873-874 (1983).

crime.16 Far from applying any narrowing construction, theCalifornia Supreme Court has described age as a "metonym

for any age-related matter suggested by the evidence or bycommon experience or morality that might reasonably inform the choice of penalty." People v. Lucky, 45 Cal. 3d 259,302, 753 P. 2d 1052, 1080 (1988), cert. denied, 488 U. S. 1034
(1989).Nor do jurors find meaningful guidance from "the presence
or absence of criminal activity by the defendant which in-volved the use or attempted use of force or violence." Although the California Supreme Court has held that "crimi-nal" is "limited to conduct

that violates a penal statute,"
People v. Wright, 52 Cal. 3d 367, 425, 802 P. 2d 221, 259 (1990)(emphasis in original), and that "force or violence" excludes

violence to property, People v. Boyd, 38 Cal. 3d 762, 700 P.2d 782 (1985), that court has not required such an instruction,
and petitioner Tuilaepa's jurors were not so instructed.This left the prosecution free to introduce evidence of "trivial incidents of misconduct and ill temper," id., at 774, 700 P.2d, at 791, and left the jury free to find an aggravator on
that basis.17

16 See, e. g., People v. Williams, Cal. Sup. Ct. No. S004522, id., at 20,

17 Even with the limiting construction, "prior criminal activity involving

force or violence" is far more open ended than factors invalidated by other
state courts as vague or subjective. See, e. g., Arnold v. State, 236 Ga.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
No less a danger is that jurors--or even judges--will treat
the mere absence of a mitigator as an aggravator, transforming a neutral or factually irrelevant factor into an illusory
aggravator.18 Although the California Supreme Court has
ruled that certain of the factors can serve only as mitigators,19 it has not required that the jury be so instructed.
See, e. g., People v. Raley, 2 Cal. 4th 870, 919, 830 P. 2d 712,
744-745 (1992), cert. denied, 507 U. S. 945 (1993). Nor has
that court restricted jury instructions to those aggravating

So. 2d 1126, 1129-1130 (La. 1985) (invalidating aggravating circumstance
of "significant" history of criminal conduct).

18 Judges, as well as juries, have fallen into this trap. See, e. g., People

v. Kaurish, 52 Cal. 3d 648, 717, 802 P. 2d 278, 316 (1990) (trial judge concluded that factor (h), dealing with a defendant's impaired capacity to appreciate the criminality of his actions, was an aggravating factor because
defendant did not have diminished capacity or other impairment), cert.
denied, 502 U. S. 837 (1991); People v. Hamilton, 48 Cal. 3d 1142, 1186,
774 P. 2d 730, 757 (1989) (trial court concluded that 10 of 11 factors were
aggravating, including factors (d)-(h) and (j)), cert. denied, 494 U. S. 1039
(1990).

19 The factors that can serve only as mitigators are:

"(d) Whether or not the offense was committed while the defendant was
under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance.

"(e) Whether or not the victim was a participant in the defendant's homicidal act or consented to the homicidal act.

"(f) Whether or not the offense was committed under circumstances
which the defendant reasonably believed to be a moral justification or
extenuation for his conduct.

"(g) Whether or not defendant acted under extreme duress or under
the substantial domination of another person.

"(h) Whether or not at the time of the offense the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was impaired as a result of mental disease
and defect, or the [e]ffects of intoxication.

"(i) The age of the defendant at the time of the crime.
"(j) Whether or not the defendant was an accomplice to the offense and
his participation in the commission of the offense was relatively minor."

factors that are factually relevant to the case.20 Clearly,some of the mitigating circumstances are so unusual that

treating their absence as an aggravating circumstance wouldmake them applicable to virtually all murderers. See People v. Davenport, 41 Cal. 3d 247, 289, 710 P. 2d 861, 888 (1985)(most murder cases present the absence of the mitigating
circumstances of moral justification and victim participation).An aggravating factor that exists in nearly every capital case
fails to fulfill its purpose of guiding the jury in distinguishing"those who deserve capital punishment from those who do
not." Arave v. Creech, 507 U. S. 463, 474 (1993). Moreover,a process creating the risk that the absence of mitigation
will count as aggravation artificially inflates the number ofaggravating factors the jury weighs, "creat[ing] the possibility not only of randomness but also of bias in favor of . . .death." Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S., at 236.

In short, open-ended factors and a lack of guidance to reg-ularize the jurors' application of these factors create a system in which, as a practical matter, improper arguments canbe made in the courtroom and credited in the jury room. I
am at a loss to see how these challenged factors furnish the" `clear and objective standards' that provide `specific and detailed guidance,' and that `make rationally reviewable theprocess for imposing a sentence of death.' "

exercised on the basis of constitutionally impermissible con-siderations--primary among them, race. Racial prejudice is

"the paradigmatic capricious and irrational sentencing fac-tor."

Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 484 (1993) (Thomas,
J., concurring). In part to diminish the danger that a sentencer will "attac[h] the `aggravating' label to factors thatare constitutionally impermissible or totally irrelevant to

the sentencing process," Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S., at 885,this Court has required that a sentencer's discretion be
curbed and informed by "clear and objective standards,"
Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 198 (1976) ( joint opinion
of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) (internal quotation

marks omitted).

Because the "circumstances of the crime" factor lacks clarity and objectivity, it poses an unacceptable risk that a sentencer will succumb to either overt or subtle racial impulses
or appeals. This risk is not merely theoretical. For far too
many jurors, the most important "circumstances of the
crime" are the race of the victim or the defendant. See McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U. S. 279, 320 (1987) (Brennan, J., dissenting); see also General Accounting Office, Report to Senate and House Committees on the Judiciary, Death Penalty
Sentencing: Research Indicates Pattern of Racial Disparities
(Feb. 1990) (surveying and synthesizing studies and finding
a "remarkably consistent" conclusion that the race of the victim influenced the likelihood of being charged with capital
murder or receiving the death penalty in 82% of cases), reprinted at 136 Cong. Rec. 12267-12268 (1990).

The California capital sentencing scheme does little to
minimize this risk. The "circumstances of the crime" factor
may be weighed in aggravation in addition to the applicable special circumstances. Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 190.3(a)
(West 1988) (the trier of fact shall take into account "[t]he
circumstances of the crime of which the defendant was convicted in the present proceeding and the existence of any
special circumstances found to be true") (emphasis added).

Blackmun, J., dissenting
The special circumstances themselves encompass many ofthe factors generally recognized as aggravating, including

multiple-murder convictions; commission of the murder in re-lation to another felony; the "especially heinous, atrocious, or
cruel" nature of the murder; and the relevant identity of thevictim (as a law enforcement officer, a witness to a crime, a
judge, a prosecutor, or a public official). The statute, there-fore, invites the jurors to speculate about, and give aggravating weight to, unspecified circumstances apart from these.Nor has the California Supreme Court attempted to limit
or guide this ranging inquiry. Far from it. That court hasconcluded that the "circumstances of the crime" factor extends beyond "merely the immediate temporal and spatialcircumstances of the crime," People v. Edwards, 54 Cal. 3d
787, 833, 819 P. 2d 436, 465 (1991), and leaves "the sentencerfree to evaluate the evidence in accordance with his or her
own subjective values," People v. Tuilaepa, 4 Cal. 4th 569,595, 842 P. 2d 1142, 1158 (1992) (case below). The court has
even warned that it has not yet "explore[d] the outer reachesof the evidence admissible as a circumstance of the crime."
People v. Edwards, 54 Cal. 3d, at 835, 819 P. 2d, at 467.Thus, the "unique opportunity for racial prejudice to operate
but remain undetected," Turner v. Murray, 476 U. S. 28, 35(1986), exists unchecked in the California capital sentencing
scheme. This does not instill confidence in the jury's deci-sion to impose the death penalty on petitioner Tuilaepa, who
is Samoan, and whose victim was white.

II
Although the Court today rejects a well-founded facialchallenge to 3 of the 11 factors that permit California jurors

to select from among capital defendants those who will re-ceive the death penalty, it has not given the California system a clean bill of health. Its unwillingness to conclude thatthese factors are valid on their face leaves the door open to
a challenge to the application of one of these factors in such

Blackmun, J., dissenting
a way that the risk of arbitrariness is realized.21 The casesbefore us, for example, do not clearly present a situation

in which the absence of a mitigator was treated as anaggravator.

Additionally, the Court's opinion says nothing about the
constitutional adequacy of California's eligibility process,which subjects a defendant to the death penalty if he is convicted of first-degree murder and the jury finds the existenceof one "special circumstance."

22 By creating nearly 20 such

special circumstances, California creates an extraordinarilylarge death pool. Because petitioners mount no challenge

to these circumstances, the Court is not called on to deter-mine that they collectively perform sufficient, meaningful
narrowing. See Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862 (1983).Of particular significance, the Court's consideration of a
small slice of one component of the California scheme says
nothing about the interaction of the various components--
the statutory definition of first-degree murder, the special
circumstances, the relevant factors, the statutorily required
weighing of aggravating and mitigating factors, and the
availability of judicial review, but not appellate proportionality review--and whether their end result satisfies the Eighth
Amendment's commands. The Court's treatment today of
the relevant factors as "selection factors" alone rests on the

21 Such a challenge would require something more than merely pointing
to others who committed similar offenses and did not receive the death
penalty, Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U. S. 764 (1990), but it is not hard to imagine
more pronounced erratic outcomes.

22 The special circumstances include premeditated and deliberate murder; felony murder based on nine felonies; the infliction of torture; that the
murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel; that the victim was
killed because of his race, religion, or ethnic origin; and the identity of the
victim, including that he was a peace officer, a federal law enforcement
officer, a firefighter, a witness to a crime, a prosecutor or assistant prosecutor, a former or current local, state, or federal judge, or an elected or
appointed local, state, or federal official. Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 190.2

Blackmun, J., dissenting
assumption, not tested, that the special circumstances perform all of the constitutionally required narrowing for eligibility. Should that assumption prove false, it would further
undermine the Court's approval today of these relevant
factors.

Similarly, in Pulley v. Harris, 465 U. S. 37, 51 (1984), the
Court's conclusion that the California capital sentencing
scheme was not "so lacking in other checks on arbitrariness
that it would not pass constitutional muster without comparative proportionality review" was based in part on an understanding that the application of the relevant factors " `provide[s] jury guidance and lessen[s] the chance of arbitrary
application of the death penalty,' " thereby " `guarantee[ing]
that the jury's discretion will be guided and its consideration
deliberate.' " Id., at 53, quoting Harris v. Pulley, 692 F. 2d
1189, 1194, 1195 (CA9 1982). As litigation exposes the failure of these factors to guide the jury in making principled
distinctions, the Court will be well advised to reevaluate its
decision in Pulley v. Harris.

In summary, the Court isolates one part of a complex
scheme and says that, assuming that all the other parts are
doing their job, this one passes muster. But the crucial
question, and one the Court will need to face, is how the
parts are working together to determine with rationality and
fairness who is exposed to the death penalty and who receives it.

III

For two decades now, the Court has professed a commitment to guiding sentencers' discretion so as to "minimize the
risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action," Gregg v.
Georgia, 428 U. S., at 189 ( joint opinion of Stewart, Powell,
and Stevens, JJ.), and to achieve principled distinctions between those who receive the death penalty and those who do
not, see, e. g., Espinosa v. Florida, 505 U. S. 1079 (1992);
Shell v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 1 (1990); Maynard v. Cart512us3$95f 12-28-97 17:51:11 PAGES OPINPGT

JOHNSON, SPEAKER OF THE FLORIDA HOUSE

OF REPRESENTATIVES, et al. v.DE GRANDY

et al.

appeal from the united states district court for thenorthern district of florida

No. 92-519. Argued October 4, 1993--Decided June 30, 1994*
In these consolidated cases, a group of Hispanic voters, a group of black

voters, and the Federal Government claim that Florida's reapportionment plan for the State's single-member Senate and House districts
(SJR 2-G) unlawfully dilutes the voting strength of Hispanics and
blacks in the Dade County area, in violation of $ 2 of the Voting Rights
Act of 1965. The State Supreme Court, in a review required by the
State Constitution, declared the plan valid under federal and state law,
while acknowledging that time constraints precluded full review and
authorizing any interested party to bring a $ 2 challenge in that court.
The plaintiffs chose, however, to pursue their claims in federal court.
A three-judge District Court reviewed the totality of circumstances as
required by $ 2 and Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, and concluded
that the three Gingles preconditions for establishing dilution were satisfied, justifying a finding of vote dilution. Specifically, the court found
that voting proceeded largely along racial lines, producing a system of
"tripartite politics"; that Hispanics in the Dade County area could constitute a majority in 11 House and 4 Senate districts, but that SJR 2-G
had created only 9 House and 3 Senate districts with Hispanic majorities; that an additional majority-black Senate district could have been
drawn; and that Florida's minorities had suffered historically from official discrimination, the social, economic, and political effects of which
they continued to feel. The court imposed a remedial plan with 11
majority-Hispanic House districts but, concluding that the remedies for
blacks and Hispanics in the senatorial districts were mutually exclusive,
left SJR 2-G's Senate districts in force.

Held:

1. The District Court properly refused to give preclusive effect to the
State Supreme Court's decision validating SJR 2-G. Pp. 1004-1006.

*Together with No. 92-593, De Grandy et al. v. Johnson, Speaker of the

2. There is no violation of $ 2 in SJR 2-G's House districts, where in
spite of continuing discrimination and racial bloc voting, minority voters
form effective voting majorities in a number of House districts roughly
proportional to their respective shares in the voting-age population.
While such proportionality is not dispositive, it is a relevant fact in the
totality of circumstances to be analyzed when determining whether minority voters have "less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of
their choice," 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(b). Pp. 1006-1022.

(a) This Court assumes without deciding that the first Gingles
factor has been satisfied in these cases. Pp. 1008-1009.

(b) While proof of the Gingles factors is necessary to make out a
claim that a set of district lines violates $ 2, it is not necessarily sufficient. Rather, a court must assess the probative significance of the
Gingles factors after considering all circumstances with arguable bearing on the issue of equal political opportunity. Here, the court misjudged the relative importance of the Gingles factors and of historical
discrimination by equating dilution where these had been found with
failure to maximize the number of majority-minority districts. Dilution
cannot be inferred from the mere failure to guarantee minority voters
maximum political influence. Pp. 1009-1017.

(c) Ruling as the State proposes, that as a matter of law no dilution
occurs whenever proportionality exists, would likewise provide a
bright-line decisional rule only in derogation of the statutory text.
While proportionality is an indication that minority voters have equal
political and electoral opportunity in spite of racial polarization, it
is no guarantee, and it cannot serve as a shortcut to determining
whether a set of districts unlawfully dilutes minority voting strength.
Pp. 1017-1021.

(d) This Court need not reach the United States' argument that
proportionality should be assessed only on a statewide basis in cases
challenging districts for electing a body with statewide jurisdiction.
The argument would recast this litigation as it comes before the Court,
for up until now the dilution claims have been litigated not on a statewide basis, but on a smaller geographical scale. Pp. 1021-1022.

3. The District Court's decision to leave undisturbed the State's plan
for Senate districts was correct. However, in reaching its decision, the
court once again misapprehended the legal test for vote dilution. As in
the case of the House districts, the totality of circumstances appears not
to support a finding of dilution in the Senate districts. Pp. 1023-1024.

815 F. Supp. 1550, affirmed in part and reversed in part.

1000 JOHNSON v. DE GRANDY

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
These consolidated cases are about the meaning of vote
dilution and the facts required to show it, when $ 2 of the
Voting Rights Act of 1965 is applied to challenges to singlemember legislative districts. See 79 Stat. 437, as amended,
42 U. S. C. $ 1973. We hold that no violation of $ 2 can be
found here, where, in spite of continuing discrimination and
racial bloc voting, minority voters form effective voting majorities in a number of districts roughly proportional to the
minority voters' respective shares in the voting-age population. While such proportionality is not dispositive in a challenge to single-member districting, it is a relevant fact in the
totality of circumstances to be analyzed when determining
whether members of a minority group have "less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in
the political process and to elect representatives of their
choice." Ibid.

I

On the first day of Florida's 1992 legislative session, a
group of Hispanic voters including Miguel De Grandy (De
Grandy plaintiffs) complained in the United States District
Court against the speaker of Florida's House of Representatives, the president of its Senate, the Governor, and other
state officials (State). The complainants alleged that the
districts from which Florida voters had chosen their state
senators and representatives since 1982 were malapportioned, failing to reflect changes in the State's population
during the ensuing decade. The State Conference of
NAACP Branches and individual black voters (NAACP

Briefs of amici curiae were filed for Grant Woods, Attorney General
of Arizona, et al. by Christopher D. Cerf; and for the Anti-Defamation
League of B'nai B'rith by Chesterfield Smith, David E. Cardwell, Scott D.
Makar, and Steven M. Freeman.

plaintiffs) filed a similar suit, which the three-judge DistrictCourt consolidated with the De Grandy case.

1

Several months after the first complaint was filed, on April10, 1992, the state legislature adopted Senate Joint Resolution 2-G (SJR 2-G), providing the reapportionment plan cur-rently at issue. The plan called for dividing Florida into 40
single-member Senate, and 120 single-member House, dis-tricts based on population data from the 1990 census. As
the Constitution of Florida required, the state attorney gen-eral then petitioned the Supreme Court of Florida for a declaratory judgment that the legislature's apportionment planwas valid under federal and state law. See Fla. Const., Art.
III, $ 16(c). The court so declared, while acknowledgingthat state constitutional time constraints precluded full review for conformity with $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act andrecognizing the right of any interested party to bring a $ 2
challenge to the plan in the Supreme Court of Florida. SeeIn re Constitutionality of Senate Joint Resolution 2G, Special Apportionment Session 1992, 597 So. 2d 276, 285-286(1992).

The De Grandy and NAACP plaintiffs responded to SJR2-G by amending their federal complaints to charge the new

that element of the litigation has been resolved separately, see De Grandy
v. Wetherell, 794 F. Supp. 1076 (ND Fla. 1992) (three-judge court), and
without appeal.

2 In an additional step not directly relevant to this appeal, the State

submitted SJR 2-G to the Department of Justice for preclearance pursuant to 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c ($ 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965). Five
Florida counties, but not Dade County, are subject to preclearance. De
Grandy v. Wetherell, 815 F. Supp. 1550, 1574 (ND Fla. 1992). When the
Attorney General of the United States refused to preclear the plan's Senate districts for the Hillsborough County area and the state legislature
refused to revise the plan, the Supreme Court of Florida ordered the adjustments necessary to obtain preclearance, 601 So. 2d 543 (1992); it is the
version of SJR 2-G so adjusted that is at issue in this litigation. 815 F.
Supp., at 1557-1558.

reapportionment plan with violating $ 2.3 They claimed thatSJR 2-G " `unlawfully fragments cohesive minority communities and otherwise impermissibly submerges their right tovote and to participate in the electoral process,' " and they
pointed to areas around the State where black or Hispanic
populations could have formed a voting majority in a politi-cally cohesive, reasonably compact district (or in more than

one), if SJR 2-G had not fragmented each group among sev-eral districts or packed it into just a few.

De Grandy v.
Wetherell, 815 F. Supp. 1550, 1559-1560 (ND Fla. 1992).The Department of Justice filed a similar complaint, naming the State of Florida and several elected officials as de-fendants and claiming that SJR 2-G diluted the voting
strength of blacks and Hispanics in two parts of the State in
violation of $ 2. The Government alleged that SJR 2-G di-luted the votes of the Hispanic population in an area largely

covered by Dade County (including Miami) and the blackpopulation in an area covering much of Escambia County
(including Pensacola).4 App. 75. The District Court con-solidated this action with the other two and held a 5-day
trial, followed immediately by an hours-long hearing onremedy.

At the end of the hearing, on July 1, 1992, the DistrictCourt ruled from the bench. It held the plan's provisions
for state House districts to be in violation of $ 2 because"more than [SJR 2-G's] nine Hispanic districts may be drawn
without having or creating a regressive effect upon black
voters," and it imposed a remedial plan offered by the De
Grandy plaintiffs calling for 11 majority-Hispanic House dis3 The complaints also alleged violation of Art. I, $ 2, and the Fourteenth
and Fifteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, but these
claims were later dismissed voluntarily.

4 The Voting Rights Act of 1965 and constitutional claims as to the Escambia County area were settled by the parties and are not at issue in
this appeal.

tricts. App. to Juris. Statement 2a, 203a. As to the Senate,the court found that a fourth majority-Hispanic district could

be drawn in addition to the three provided by SJR 2-G, butonly at the expense of black voters in the area. Id., at 202a;
815 F. Supp., at 1560. The court was of two minds about theimplication of this finding, once observing that it meant the
legislature's plan for the Senate was a violation of $ 2 butwithout a remedy, once saying the plan did not violate $ 2
at all.5 In any event, it ordered elections to be held using
SJR 2-G's senatorial districts.In a later, expanded opinion the court reviewed the totality of circumstances as required by $ 2 and Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30 (1986). In explaining Dade County's "tripartite politics," in which "ethnic factors . . . predominateover all other[s] . . . ," 815 F. Supp., at 1572, the court found

political cohesion within each of the Hispanic and black populations but none between the two, id., at 1569, and a tendencyof non-Hispanic whites to vote as a bloc to bar minority

groups from electing their chosen candidates except in a dis5 The court's judgment filed July 2, 1992, App. to Juris. Statement 5a,
said SJR 2-G's state senatorial districts "do not violate Section 2," but its
subsequent opinion explaining the judgment said the senatorial districts
do indeed violate $ 2, and that its earlier language "should be read as
holding that the Florida Senate plan does not violate Section 2 such that
a different remedy must be imposed." 815 F. Supp., at 1582 (emphasis
added).

Any conflict in these two formulations is of no consequence here. "This
Court `reviews judgments, not statements in opinions,' " California v.
Rooney, 483 U. S. 307, 311 (1987) (per curiam) (quoting Black v. Cutter
Laboratories, 351 U. S. 292, 297 (1956)), and the De Grandy plaintiffs and
the United States have appealed the failure of the District Court to provide relief for alleged $ 2 violations in SJR 2-G's senatorial districts. The
State is entitled to "urge any grounds which would lend support to the
judgment below," Dayton Bd. of Ed. v. Brinkman, 433 U. S. 406, 419
(1977), including the argument it makes here that the District Court was
correct not to impose a remedy different from SJR 2-G because the
State's reapportionment plan did not violate $ 2.

Opinion of the Court
trict where a given minority makes up a voting majority,6id., at 1572. The court further found that the nearly one

million Hispanics in the Dade County area could be combinedinto 4 Senate and 11 House districts, each one relatively compact and with a functional majority of Hispanic voters, id.,at 1568-1569, whereas SJR 2-G created fewer majorityHispanic districts; and that one more Senate district with ablack voting majority could have been drawn,

id., at 1576.Noting that Florida's minorities bore the social, economic,

and political effects of past discrimination, the court con-cluded that SJR 2-G impermissibly diluted the voting
strength of Hispanics in its House districts and of both His-panics and blacks in its Senate districts.

Id., at 1574. Thefindings of vote dilution in the senatorial districts had no

practical effect, however, because the court held that reme-dies for the blacks and the Hispanics were mutually exclusive; it consequently deferred to the state legislature's workas the "fairest" accommodation of all the ethnic communities
in south Florida. Id., at 1580.We stayed the judgment of the District Court, 505 U. S.
1232 (1992), and noted probable jurisdiction, 507 U. S. 907(1993).

II
Before going to the issue at the heart of these cases, weneed to consider the District Court's refusal to give preclusive effect to the decision of the State Supreme Court vali-dating SJR 2-G. The State argues that the claims of the De
Grandy plaintiffs should have been dismissed as res judicatabecause they had a full and fair opportunity to litigate vote
dilution before the State Supreme Court, see In re Constitutionality of Senate Joint Resolution 2G, Special Apportion-ment Session 1992, 597 So. 2d, at 285. The premise, how6 The Court recognizes that the terms "black," "Hispanic," and "white"
are neither mutually exclusive nor collectively exhaustive. We follow the
practice of the District Court in using them as rough indicators of south
Florida's three largest racial and linguistic minority groups.

Opinion of the Court
ever, is false, exaggerating the review afforded the DeGrandy plaintiffs in the state court and ignoring that court's

own opinion of its judgment's limited scope. Given the stateconstitutional mandate to review apportionment resolutions
within 30 days, see Fla. Const., Art. III, $ 16(c), the Supreme
Court of Florida accepted briefs and evidentiary submis-sions, but held no trial. In that court's own words, it was

"impossible . . . to conduct the complete factual analysis con-templated by the Voting Rights Act . . . within the time constraints of article III," and its holding was accordingly "with-out prejudice to the right of any protestor to question the
validity of the plan by filing a petition in this Court alleging
how the plan violates the Voting Rights Act." 597 So. 2d,
at 282, 285-286.

The State balks at recognizing this express reservation by
blaming the De Grandy plaintiffs for not returning to the
State Supreme Court with the $ 2 claims. But the plaintiffs
are free to litigate in any court with jurisdiction, and their
choice to forgo further, optional state review hardly converted the state constitutional judgment into a decision following "full and fair opportunity to litigate," Allen v. McCurry, 449 U. S. 90, 104 (1980), as res judicata would require.
For that matter, a federal court gives no greater preclusive
effect to a state-court judgment than the state court itself
would do, Marrese v. American Academy of Orthopaedic
Surgeons, 470 U. S. 373, 384-386 (1985), and the Supreme
Court of Florida made it plain that its preliminary look at
the vote dilution claims would have no preclusive effect
under Florida law.

The State does not, of course, argue that res judicata bars
the claims of the United States, which was not a party in the
Florida Supreme Court action. It contends instead that the
Federal Government's $ 2 challenge deserved dismissal
under this Court's Rooker/Feldman abstention doctrine,
under which a party losing in state court is barred from seeking what in substance would be appellate review of the state

Opinion of the Court
judgment in a United States district court, based on the los-ing party's claim that the state judgment itself violates the

loser's federal rights. See District of Columbia Court ofAppeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S. 462, 482 (1983); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413, 416 (1923). But the invoca-tion of

Rooker/Feldman is just as inapt here, for unlikeRooker or Feldman, the United States was not a party in the

state court. It was in no position to ask this Court to re-view the state court's judgment and has not directly attacked
it in this proceeding. Cf. Feldman, supra, at 468, and n. 2,472, and n. 8 (suing District of Columbia Court of Appeals);
Rooker, supra, at 414 (seeking to have state court's judg-ment declared null and void). The United States merely
seeks to litigate its $ 2 case for the first time, and the Govern-ment's claims, like those of the private plaintiffs, are properly before the federal courts.

III
On the merits of the vote dilution claims covering theHouse districts, the crux of the State's argument is the

power of Hispanics under SJR 2-G to elect candidates oftheir choice in a number of districts that mirrors their share
of the Dade County area's voting-age population (i. e., 9 outof 20 House districts); this power, according to the State,
bars any finding that the plan dilutes Hispanic votingstrength. The District Court is said to have missed that
conclusion by mistaking our precedents to require the planto maximize the number of Hispanic-controlled districts.

The State's argument takes us back to ground covered lastTerm in two cases challenging single-member districts. See
Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146 (1993); Growe v. Emison,507 U. S. 25 (1993). In Growe, we held that a claim of vote
dilution in a single-member district requires proof meetingthe same three threshold conditions for a dilution challenge
to a multimember district: that a minority group be " `suffi-ciently large and geographically compact to constitute a ma512us3$96m 12-28-97 18:02:59 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
jority in a single-member district' "; that it be " `politicallycohesive' "; and that " `the white majority vot[e] sufficiently

as a bloc to enable it . . . usually to defeat the minority'spreferred candidate.' " Id., at 40 (quoting Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S., at 50-51). Of course, as we reflected in Voinovich and amplify later in this opinion, "the Gingles factorscannot be applied mechanically and without regard to the

nature of the claim." 507 U. S., at 158.In Voinovich we explained how manipulation of district
lines can dilute the voting strength of politically cohesiveminority group members, whether by fragmenting the minority voters among several districts where a bloc-votingmajority can routinely outvote them, or by packing them into
one or a small number of districts to minimize their influencein the districts next door. See

id., at 153-154. Section 2prohibits either sort of line-drawing where its result, " `interact[ing] with social and historical conditions,' impairs theability of a protected class to elect its candidate of choice on
an equal basis with other voters." Ibid. (quoting Gingles,
supra, at 47).7Plaintiffs in Growe and Voinovich failed to show vote dilution because the former did not prove political cohesivenessof the minority group,

Growe, supra, at 41-42, and the lattershowed no significant white bloc voting, Voinovich, supra, at

158. Here, on the contrary, the District Court found, andthe State does not challenge, the presence of both these Gingles preconditions. The dispute in this litigation centers ontwo quite different questions: whether Hispanics are sufficiently numerous and geographically compact to be a major-ity in additional single-member districts, as required by the
first Gingles factor; and whether, even with all three Gingles

gerrymanders have played a central role in discrimination against minority groups, see Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339 (1960); Perkins v.
Matthews, 400 U. S. 379 (1971); Connor v. Finch, 431 U. S. 407 (1977).

Opinion of the Court
conditions satisfied, the circumstances in totality support afinding of vote dilution when Hispanics can be expected to

elect their chosen representatives in substantial proportionto their percentage of the area's population.

A
When applied to a claim that single-member districts di-lute minority votes, the first Gingles condition requires the

possibility of creating more than the existing number of rea-sonably compact districts with a sufficiently large minority
population to elect candidates of its choice. The DistrictCourt found the condition satisfied by contrasting SJR 2-G
with the De Grandy plan for the Dade County area, whichprovided for 11 reasonably compact districts, each with a
voting-age population at least 64 percent Hispanic. 815 F.Supp., at 1580. While the percentage figures are not disputed, the parties disagree about the sufficiency of these su-permajorities to allow Hispanics to elect representatives of
their choice in all 11 districts. The District Court agreedwith plaintiffs that the supermajorities would compensate
for the number of voting-age Hispanics who did not vote,most commonly because they were recent immigrants who
had not become citizens of the United States. Id., at 1567-1568. The State protests that fully half of the Hispanic
voting-age residents of the region are not citizens, with theresult that several districts in the De Grandy plan lack
enough Hispanic voters to elect candidates of their choicewithout cross-over votes from other ethnic groups. On
these assumptions, the State argues that the condition nec-essary to justify tinkering with the State's plan disappears.

We can leave this dispute without a winner. The parties'ostensibly factual disagreement raises an issue of law about
which characteristic of minority populations (e. g., age, citi-zenship) ought to be the touchstone for proving a dilution
claim and devising a sound remedy. These cases may beresolved, however, without reaching this issue or the related

Opinion of the Court
question whether the first Gingles condition can be satisfiedby proof that a so-called influence district may be created

(that is, by proof that plaintiffs can devise an additional dis-trict in which members of a minority group are a minority
of the voters, but a potentially influential one). As in thepast, we will assume without deciding that even if Hispanics
are not an absolute majority of the relevant population inthe additional districts, the first

Gingles condition has beensatisfied in these cases. See Voinovich, supra, at 154; see

also Growe, supra, at 41-42, n. 5 (declining to reach theissue); Gingles, supra, at 46-47, n. 12 (same).

B
We do, however, part company from the District Court inassessing the totality of circumstances. The District Court

found that the three Gingles preconditions were satisfied,and that Hispanics had suffered historically from official discrimination, the social, economic, and political effects ofwhich they generally continued to feel, 815 F. Supp., at 1573-
1574. Without more, and on the apparent assumption thatwhat could have been done to create additional Hispanic supermajority districts should have been done, the DistrictCourt found a violation of $ 2. But the assumption was erroneous, and more is required, as a review of Gingles will show.

"based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown thatthe political processes leading to nomination or election

has used voting practices or procedures that tend to enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the minority group, such as unusually large
election districts, majority vote requirements, and prohibitions against
bullet voting; the exclusion of members of the minority group from candidate slating processes; the extent to which minority group members bear
the effects of past discrimination in areas such as education, employment,

Opinion of the Court
"[w]hile many or all of [them] may be relevant to aclaim of vote dilution through submergence in multimember districts, unless there is a conjunction of thefollowing circumstances, the use of multimember districts generally will not impede the ability of minorityvoters to elect representatives of their choice. Stated
succinctly, a bloc voting majority must usually be ableto defeat candidates supported by a politically cohesive,
geographically insular minority group." Id., at 48-49(footnote omitted) (emphasis in original).

The Court thus summarized the three now-familiar Ginglesfactors (compactness/numerousness, minority cohesion or
bloc voting, and majority bloc voting) as "necessary precon-ditions,"

id., at 50, for establishing vote dilution by use of amultimember district.

But if Gingles so clearly identified the three as generallynecessary to prove a $ 2 claim, it just as clearly declined to
hold them sufficient in combination, either in the sense thata court's examination of relevant circumstances was complete once the three factors were found to exist, or in thesense that the three in combination necessarily and in all
circumstances demonstrated dilution. This was true notonly because bloc voting was a matter of degree, with a variable legal significance depending on other facts, id., at 55-58,but also because the ultimate conclusions about equality or
inequality of opportunity were intended by Congress to bejudgments resting on comprehensive, not limited, canvassing
of relevant facts. Lack of electoral success is evidence ofvote dilution, but courts must also examine other evidence
in the totality of circumstances, including the extent of theopportunities minority voters enjoy to participate in the ponotes also that evidence demonstrating that elected officials are unresponsive to the particularized needs of the members of the minority group and
that the policy underlying the State's or the political subdivision's use of
the contested practice or structure is tenuous may have probative value.

litical processes. Id., at 46, 79-80; id., at 98-99 (O'Connor,J., concurring in judgment). To be sure, some $ 2 plaintiffs

may have easy cases, but although lack of equal electoralopportunity may be readily imagined and unsurprising when
demonstrated under circumstances that include the three es-sential

Gingles factors, that conclusion must still be ad-dressed explicitly, and without isolating any other arguably

relevant facts from the act of judgment.10

2
If the three Gingles factors may not be isolated as suffi-cient, standing alone, to prove dilution in every multimember

district challenge, a fortiori they must not be when the chal-lenge goes to a series of single-member districts, where dilution may be more difficult to grasp. Plaintiffs challengingsingle-member districts may claim, not total submergence,
but partial submergence; not the chance for some electoral

10 If challenges to multimember districts are likely to be the easier plaintiffs' cases, it is worth remembering that even in multimember district
challenges, proof of the Gingles factors has not always portended liability
under $ 2. In Baird v. Consolidated City of Indianapolis, 976 F. 2d 357
(1992), the Seventh Circuit confronted a scheme for electing a City-County
Council of 29 members. Voters chose 25 of their representatives from
single-member districts and 4 at large, from a district representing the
entire area. Black plaintiffs brought a vote dilution claim challenging the
lines for single-member districts and the existence of the four-member
at-large district. After the Council had redrawn its single-member districts to rectify dilution there, the District Court held, and the Seventh
Circuit affirmed, that the four-member district did not dilute black voting
strength because proof of the three Gingles factors was not enough "if
other considerations show that the minority has an undiminished right
to participate in the political process." 976 F. 2d, at 359. The "other
considerations" in Baird included the fact that the new single-member
districts were so drawn that blacks formed a voting majority in seven of
them (28 percent of the single-member districts and 24 percent of the
entire council) while blacks constituted 21 percent of the local population;
and that while the four at-large seats tended to go to Republicans, one of
the Republicans elected in 1991 was black. Id., at 358, 361.

Opinion of the Court
success in place of none, but the chance for more success inplace of some. When the question thus comes down to the

reasonableness of drawing a series of district lines in onecombination of places rather than another, judgments about
inequality may become closer calls. As facts beyond the
ambit of the three Gingles factors loom correspondinglylarger, factfinders cannot rest uncritically on assumptions

about the force of the Gingles factors in pointing to dilution.The cases now before us, of course, fall on this more
complex side of the divide, requiring a court to determinewhether provision for somewhat fewer majority-minority
districts than the number sought by the plaintiffs was dilution of the minority votes. The District Court was accordingly required to assess the probative significance of the
Gingles factors critically after considering the further circumstances with arguable bearing on the issue of equal political opportunity. We think that in finding dilution here
the District Court misjudged the relative importance of the
Gingles factors and of historical discrimination, measured
against evidence tending to show that in spite of these facts,
SJR 2-G would provide minority voters with an equal measure of political and electoral opportunity.

The District Court did not, to be sure, commit the error of
treating the three Gingles conditions as exhausting the enquiry required by $ 2. Consistently with Gingles, the court
received evidence of racial relations outside the immediate
confines of voting behavior and found a history of discrimination against Hispanic voters continuing in society generally
to the present day. But the District Court was not critical
enough in asking whether a history of persistent discrimination reflected in the larger society and its bloc-voting behavior portended any dilutive effect from a newly proposed
districting scheme, whose pertinent features were majorityminority districts in substantial proportion to the minority's
share of voting-age population. The court failed to ask
whether the totality of facts, including those pointing to

Opinion of the Court
proportionality,11 showed that the new scheme would deny
minority voters equal political opportunity.

Treating equal political opportunity as the focus of the
enquiry, we do not see how these district lines, apparently

providing political effectiveness in proportion to voting-age
numbers, deny equal political opportunity. The record establishes that Hispanics constitute 50 percent of the votingage population in Dade County and under SJR 2-G would
make up supermajorities in 9 of the 18 House districts located primarily within the county. Likewise, if one considers the 20 House districts located at least in part within Dade
County, the record indicates that Hispanics would be an effective voting majority in 45 percent of them (i. e., nine), and
would constitute 47 percent of the voting-age population in
the area. 815 F. Supp., at 1580; App. to Juris. Statement
180a-183a. In other words, under SJR 2-G Hispanics in the
Dade County area would enjoy substantial proportionality.
On this evidence, we think the State's scheme would thwart
the historical tendency to exclude Hispanics, not encourage
or perpetuate it. Thus in spite of that history and its legacy,
including the racial cleavages that characterize Dade County
politics today, we see no grounds for holding in these cases

11 "Proportionality" as the term is used here links the number of
majority-minority voting districts to minority members' share of the relevant population. The concept is distinct from the subject of the proportional representation clause of $ 2, which provides that "nothing in
this section establishes a right to have members of a protected class
elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population." 42
U. S. C. $ 1973(b). This proviso speaks to the success of minority candidates, as distinct from the political or electoral power of minority voters.
Cf. Senate Report 29, n. 115 (minority candidates' success at the polls is
not conclusive proof of minority voters' access to the political process).
And the proviso also confirms what is otherwise clear from the text of the
statute, namely, that the ultimate right of $ 2 is equality of opportunity,
not a guarantee of electoral success for minority-preferred candidates of
whatever race.

Opinion of the Court
that SJR 2-G's district lines diluted the votes cast by Hispanic voters.

The De Grandy plaintiffs urge us to put more weight on
the District Court's findings of packing and fragmentation,
allegedly accomplished by the way the State drew certain
specific lines: "[T]he line of District 116 separates heavily
Hispanic neighborhoods in District 112 from the rest of the
heavily Hispanic Kendall Lakes area and the Kendall area,"
so that the line divides "neighbors making up the . . . same
housing development in Kendall Lakes," and District 114
"packs" Hispanic voters, while Districts 102 and 109 "fragmen[t]" them. 815 F. Supp., at 1569 (internal quotation
marks omitted). We would agree that where a State has
split (or lumped) minority neighborhoods that would have
been grouped into a single district (or spread among several)
if the State had employed the same line-drawing standards
in minority neighborhoods as it used elsewhere in the jurisdiction, the inconsistent treatment might be significant evidence of a $ 2 violation, even in the face of proportionality.
The District Court, however, made no such finding. Indeed,
the propositions the court recites on this point are not even
phrased as factual findings, but merely as recitations of testimony offered by plaintiffs' expert witness. While the District Court may well have credited the testimony, the court
was apparently wary of adopting the witness's conclusions as
findings. But even if one imputed a greater significance to
the accounts of testimony, they would boil down to findings
that several of SJR 2-G's district lines separate portions of
Hispanic neighborhoods, while another district line draws
several Hispanic neighborhoods into a single district. This,
however, would be to say only that lines could have been
drawn elsewhere, nothing more. But some dividing by district lines and combining within them is virtually inevitable
and befalls any population group of substantial size. Attaching the labels "packing" and "fragmenting" to these phenom512us3$96m 12-28-97 18:02:59 PAGES OPINPGT
1016 JOHNSON v. DE GRANDY

Opinion of the Court
ena, without more, does not make the result vote dilutionwhen the minority group enjoys substantial proportionality.

3
It may be that the significance of the facts under $ 2 wasobscured by the rule of thumb apparently adopted by the

District Court, that anything short of the maximum numberof majority-minority districts consistent with the

Ginglesconditions would violate $ 2, at least where societal discrimination against the minority had occurred and continued tooccur. But reading the first Gingles condition in effect to
define dilution as a failure to maximize in the face of blocvoting (plus some other incidents of societal bias to be expected where bloc voting occurs) causes its own dangers, andthey are not to be courted.

Assume a hypothetical jurisdiction of 1,000 voters dividedinto 10 districts of 100 each, where members of a minority
group make up 40 percent of the voting population and vot-ing is totally polarized along racial lines. With the right
geographic dispersion to satisfy the compactness require-ment, and with careful manipulation of district lines, the minority voters might be placed in control of as many as 7 ofthe 10 districts. Each such district could be drawn with at
least 51 members of the minority group, and whether theremaining minority voters were added to the groupings of
51 for safety or scattered in the other three districts, minor-ity voters would be able to elect candidates of their choice in
all seven districts.12 The point of the hypothetical is not, ofcourse, that any given district is likely to be open to such
extreme manipulation, or that bare majorities are likely tovote in full force and strictly along racial lines, but that reading $ 2 to define dilution as any failure to maximize tends to

12 Minority voters might instead be denied control over a single seat, of
course. Each district would need to include merely 51 members of the
majority group; minority voters fragmented among the 10 districts could
be denied power to affect the result in any district.

obscure the very object of the statute and to run counter toits textually stated purpose. One may suspect vote dilution

from political famine, but one is not entitled to suspect (muchless infer) dilution from mere failure to guarantee a political
feast. However prejudiced a society might be, it would beabsurd to suggest that the failure of a districting scheme to
provide a minority group with effective political power 75percent above its numerical strength

13 indicates a denial of

equal participation in the political process. Failure to maxi-mize cannot be the measure of $ 2.

4
While, for obvious reasons, the State agrees that a failureto leverage minority political strength to the maximum possible point of power is not definitive of dilution in bloc-votingsocieties, it seeks to impart a measure of determinacy by
applying a definitive rule of its own: that as a matter oflaw no dilution occurs whenever the percentage of singlemember districts in which minority voters form an effec-tive majority mirrors the minority voters' percentage of the
relevant population.14 Proportionality so defined, see n. 11,

13 When 40 percent of the population determines electoral outcomes in 7
out of 10 districts, the minority group can be said to enjoy effective political power 75 percent above its numerical strength.

14 See Brief for Appellees in Nos. 92-593, 92-767, p. 20 ("If the statutory

prohibition against providing minorities `less opportunity than other members of the electorate . . . to elect representatives of their choice' is given
its natural meaning, it cannot be violated by a single-member district plan
that assures minority groups voting control over numbers of districts that
are numerically proportional to their population in the area where presence of the three Gingles preconditions has been established").

The parties dispute whether the relevant figure is the minority group's
share of the population, or of some subset of the population, such as those
who are eligible to vote, in that they are United States citizens, over 18
years of age, and not registered at another address (as students and members of the military often are). Because we do not elevate this proportion
to the status of a magic parameter, and because it is not dispositive here,
we do not resolve that dispute. See supra, at 1008-1009.

supra, would thus be a safe harbor for any districtingscheme.

The safety would be in derogation of the statutory textand its considered purpose, however, and of the ideal that
the Voting Rights Act of 1965 attempts to foster. An inflex-ible rule would run counter to the textual command of

$ 2, that the presence or absence of a violation be assessed"based on the totality of circumstances. " 42 U. S. C.

$ 1973(b). The need for such "totality" review springs fromthe demonstrated ingenuity of state and local governments
in hobbling minority voting power, McCain v. Lybrand, 465U. S. 236, 243-246 (1984), a point recognized by Congress
when it amended the statute in 1982: "[S]ince the adoptionof the Voting Rights Act, [some] jurisdictions have substantially moved from direct, over[t] impediments to the rightto vote to more sophisticated devices that dilute minority
voting strength," Senate Report 10 (discussing $ 5). Inmodifying $ 2, Congress thus endorsed our view in White
v. Regester, 412 U. S. 755 (1973), that "whether the politicalprocesses are `equally open' depends upon a searching practical evaluation of the `past and present reality,' " SenateReport 30 (quoting 412 U. S., at 766, 770). In a substantial
number of voting jurisdictions, that past reality has includedsuch reprehensible practices as ballot box stuffing, outright
violence, discretionary registration, property requirements,the poll tax, and the white primary; and other practices censurable when the object of their use is discriminatory, suchas at-large elections, runoff requirements, anti-single-shot
devices, gerrymandering, the impeachment of officeholders,the annexation or deannexation of territory, and the creation
or elimination of elective offices.15 Some of those expedients

could occur even in a jurisdiction with numerically demon-strable proportionality; the harbor safe for States would thus

not be safe for voters.16 It is, in short, for good reason thatwe have been, and remain, chary of entertaining a simplification of the sort the State now urges upon us. Cf. Gingles,478 U. S., at 77 ("[P]ersistent proportional representation . . .
[may] not accurately reflect the minority group's ability to
elect its preferred representatives").Even if the State's safe harbor were open only in cases of

alleged dilution by the manipulation of district lines, how-ever, it would rest on an unexplored premise of highly suspect validity: that in any given voting jurisdiction (or portionof that jurisdiction under consideration), the rights of some
minority voters under $ 2 may be traded off against the
rights of other members of the same minority class. Underthe State's view, the most blatant racial gerrymandering in

half of a county's single-member districts would be irrelevant
under $ 2 if offset by political gerrymandering in the other
half, so long as proportionality was the bottom line. But see
Baird v. Consolidated City of Indianapolis, 976 F. 2d 357,
359 (CA7 1992) ("A balanced bottom line does not foreclose
proof of discrimination along the way"); Richmond v. United
States, 422 U. S. 358, 378-379 (1975) (territorial annexation
aimed at diluting black votes forbidden by $ 5, regardless of
its actual effect).

Finally, we reject the safe harbor rule because of a tendency the State would itself certainly condemn, a tendency to
promote and perpetuate efforts to devise majority-minority
districts even in circumstances where they may not be necesmittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the
Judiciary, 97th Cong., 1st Sess., 1999-2022, 2115-2120 (1981).

16 The State might say, of course, that ostensibly "proportional" districting schemes that were nonetheless subject to diluting practices would not
"assur[e]" minority voters their apparent voting power. But this answer
would take us right back to a searching review of the factual totality,
leaving the State's defensive rule without any particular utility.

Opinion of the Court
sary to achieve equal political and electoral opportunity.Because in its simplest form the State's rule would shield

from $ 2 challenge a districting scheme in which the numberof majority-minority districts reflected the minority's share
of the relevant population, the conclusiveness of the rulemight be an irresistible inducement to create such districts.
It bears recalling, however, that for all the virtues ofmajority-minority districts as remedial devices, they rely on
a quintessentially race-conscious calculus aptly described asthe "politics of second best," see B. Grofman, L. Handley, &
R. Niemi, Minority Representation and the Quest for VotingEquality 136 (1992). If the lesson of

Gingles is that society'sracial and ethnic cleavages sometimes necessitate majorityminority districts to ensure equal political and electoral op-portunity, that should not obscure the fact that there are
communities in which minority citizens are able to form co-alitions with voters from other racial and ethnic groups, having no need to be a majority within a single district in orderto elect candidates of their choice. Those candidates may
not represent perfection to every minority voter, but minor-ity voters are not immune from the obligation to pull, haul,
and trade to find common political ground, the virtue ofwhich is not to be slighted in applying a statute meant to
hasten the waning of racism in American politics.It is enough to say that, while proportionality in the sense
used here is obviously an indication that minority votershave an equal opportunity, in spite of racial polarization, "to
participate in the political process and to elect representa-tives of their choice," 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(b), the degree of probative value assigned to proportionality may vary with otherfacts.

17 No single statistic provides courts with a shortcut

17 So, too, the degree of probative value assigned to disproportionality,
in a case where it is shown, will vary not only with the degree of disproportionality but with other factors as well. "[T]here is no indication that
Congress intended to mandate a single, universally applicable standard
for measuring undiluted minority voting strength, regardless of local con512us3$96m 12-28-97 18:02:59 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
to determine whether a set of single-member districts un-lawfully dilutes minority voting strength.

5
While the United States concedes the relevance of propor-tionality to a $ 2 claim, it would confine proportionality to an

affirmative defense, and one to be made only on a statewidebasis in cases that challenge districts for electing a body with
statewide jurisdiction. In this litigation, the United Stateswould have us treat any claim that evidence of proportionality supports the State's plan as having been waived becausethe State made no argument in the District Court that the
proportion of districts statewide in which Hispanics consti-tute an effective voting majority mirrors the proportion of
statewide Hispanic population.18The argument has two flaws. There is, first, no textual
reason to segregate some circumstances from the statutorytotality, to be rendered insignificant unless the defendant
pleads them by way of affirmative defense. Second, and justas importantly, the argument would recast these cases as
they come to us, in order to bar consideration of proportion-ality except on statewide scope, whereas up until now the

ditions and regardless of the extent of past discrimination against minority
voters in a particular State or political subdivision." Gingles, 478 U. S.,
at 94-95 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).

18 The argument for proportionality statewide favors the State if it is

based on the proportion of Hispanic citizens of voting age statewide. According to census data not available at the time of trial and thus not in
the record, Hispanics constitute 7.15 percent of the citizen voting-age population of Florida, which corresponds to eight or nine Hispanic-majority
House districts (120 2 7.15% 4 8.58).

If instead one calculates the proportion of statewide Hispanic-majority
House districts on the basis of total population or voting-age population,
the result favors plaintiffs. Hispanics constitute 12.2 percent of the
State's total population and 11.7 percent of the State's voting-age population, corresponding to 14 or 15 seats (120 2 12.2% 4 14.64; 120 2 11.7%
4 14.04). We need not choose among these calculations to decide these
cases.

1022 JOHNSON v. DE GRANDY

Opinion of the Court
dilution claims have been litigated on a smaller geographicalscale. It is, indeed, the plaintiffs themselves, including the

United States, who passed up the opportunity to frame theirdilution claim in statewide terms. While the United States
points to language in its complaint alleging that the redis-tricting plans dilute the votes of "Hispanic citizens and black
citizens in the State of Florida," App. 77, the complaint iden-tifies "several areas of the State" where such violations of

$ 2 are said to occur, and then speaks in terms of Hispanicsin the Dade County area (and blacks in the area of Escambia
County), id., at 75-76. Nowhere do the allegations indicatethat claims of dilution "in the State of Florida" are not to be
considered in terms of the areas specifically mentioned.The complaint alleges no facts at all about the contours, demographics, or voting patterns of any districts outside theDade County or Escambia County areas, and neither the evidence at trial nor the opinion of the District Court addressedwhite bloc voting and political cohesion of minorities statewide. The De Grandy plaintiffs even voluntarily dismissedtheir claims of Hispanic vote dilution outside the Dade
County area. See 815 F. Supp., at 1559, n. 13. Thus wehave no occasion to decide which frame of reference should
have been used if the parties had not apparently agreed inthe District Court on the appropriate geographical scope for
analyzing the alleged $ 2 violation and devising its remedy.

6
In sum, the District Court's finding of dilution did not ad-dress the statutory standard of unequal political and electoral opportunity, and reflected instead a misconstruction of$ 2 that equated dilution with failure to maximize the number
of reasonably compact majority-minority districts. Becausethe ultimate finding of dilution in districting for the Florida
House was based on a misreading of the governing law, wehold it to be clearly erroneous. See

Gingles, 478 U. S., at79.

Opinion of the Court

IV
Having found insufficient evidence of vote dilution in the
drawing of House districts in the Dade County area, we look
now to the comparable districts for the state Senate. As in
the case of House districts, we understand the District Court
to have misapprehended the legal test for vote dilution when
it found a violation of $ 2 in the location of the Senate district
lines. Because the court did not modify the State's plan,
however, we hold the ultimate result correct in this instance.

SJR 2-G creates 40 single-member Senate districts, 5 of
them wholly within Dade County. Of these five, three have
Hispanic supermajorities of at least 64 percent, and one has
a clear majority of black voters. Two more Senate districts
crossing county lines include substantial numbers of Dade
County voters, and in one of these, black voters, although
not close to a majority, are able to elect representatives of
their choice with the aid of cross-over votes. 815 F. Supp.,
at 1574, 1579.

Within this seven-district Dade County area, both minority groups enjoy rough proportionality. The voting-age population in the seven-district area is 44.8 percent Hispanic and
15.8 percent black. Record, U. S. Exh. 7. Hispanics predominate in 42.9 percent of the districts (three out of seven),
as do blacks in 14.3 percent of them (one out of seven).
While these numbers indicate something just short of perfect proportionality (42.9 percent against 44.8; 14.3 percent
against 15.8), the opposite is true of the five districts located
wholly within Dade County.19

19 In the five districts wholly within Dade County, where Hispanics are
concentrated, the voting-age population is 53.9 percent Hispanic and 13.5
percent black. Sixty percent of the districts are Hispanic majority (three
out of five), and 20 percent are black majority (one out of five), so that
each minority group protected by $ 2 enjoys an effective voting majority
in marginally more districts than proportionality would indicate (60 percent over 53.9; 20 percent over 13.5).

1024 JOHNSON v. DE GRANDY

Opinion of the Court
The District Court concentrated not on these facts but onwhether additional districts could be drawn in which either

Hispanics or blacks would constitute an effective majority.The court found that indeed a fourth senatorial district with
a Hispanic supermajority could be drawn, or that an addi-tional district could be created with a black majority, in each
case employing reasonably compact districts. Having pre-viously established that each minority group was politically
cohesive, that each labored under a legacy of official discrimi-nation, and that whites voted as a bloc, the District Court
believed it faced "two independent, viable Section 2 claims."815 F. Supp., at 1577. Because the court did not, however,
think it was possible to create both another Hispanic districtand another black district on the same map, it concluded that
no remedy for either violation was practical and, deferring tothe State's plan as a compromise policy, imposed SJR 2-G's
senatorial districts. Id., at 1580.We affirm the District Court's decision to leave the State's
plan for Florida State Senate districts undisturbed. As inthe case of the House districts, the totality of circumstances
appears not to support a finding of vote dilution here, whereboth minority groups constitute effective voting majorities
in a number of state Senate districts substantially propor-tional to their share in the population, and where plaintiffs
have not produced evidence otherwise indicating that underSJR 2-G voters in either minority group have "less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate inthe political process and to elect representatives of their
choice." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(b).

There being no violation of the Voting Rights Act shown,we have no occasion to review the District Court's decisions

going to remedy. The judgment of the District Court isaccordingly affirmed in part and reversed in part.

It is so ordered.

Justice O'Connor, concurring.
The critical issue in these cases is whether $ 2 of the Vot-ing Rights Act of 1965, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973, requires courts to

"maximize" the number of districts in which minority votersmay elect their candidates of choice. The District Court,
applying the maximization principle, operated "on the appar-ent assumption that what could have been done to create
additional Hispanic supermajority districts should have beendone." Ante, at 1009. The Court today makes clear that
the District Court was in error, and that the Voting RightsAct does not require maximization. Ante, at 1017 ("Failure
to maximize cannot be the measure of $ 2"); ante, at 1022 (theDistrict Court improperly "equated dilution with failure to
maximize the number of reasonably compact majority-minority districts").

But today's opinion does more than reject the maximiza-tion principle. The opinion's central teaching is that proportionality--defined as the relationship between the number ofmajority-minority voting districts and the minority group's
share of the relevant population--is always relevant evi-dence in determining vote dilution, but is

never itself dispositive. Lack of proportionality is probative evidence of votedilution. "[A]ny theory of vote dilution must necessarily

rely to some extent on a measure of minority voting strengththat makes some reference to the proportion between the
minority group and the electorate at large." Thornburg v.
Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, 84 (1986) (O'Connor, J., concurring in
judgment). Thus, in evaluating the Gingles preconditionsand the totality of the circumstances a court must always

consider the relationship between the number of majorityminority voting districts and the minority group's share ofthe population. Cf.

id., at 99 ("[T]he relative lack of minority electoral success under a challenged plan, when comparedwith the success that would be predicted under the measure

of undiluted minority voting strength the court is employing,can constitute powerful evidence of vote dilution").

1026 JOHNSON v. DE GRANDY

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
The Court also makes clear that proportionality is neverdispositive. Lack of proportionality can never by itself

prove dilution, for courts must always carefully and search-ingly review the totality of the circumstances, including the
extent to which minority groups have access to the political
process. Ante, at 1011-1012. Nor does the presence of pro-portionality prove the absence of dilution. Proportionality

is not a safe harbor for States; it does not immunize theirelection schemes from $ 2 challenge.

Ante, at 1017-1021.
In sum, the Court's carefully crafted approach treats pro-portionality as relevant evidence, but does not make it the

only relevant evidence. In doing this the Court makes clearthat $ 2 does not require maximization of minority voting
strength, yet remains faithful to $ 2's command that minority
voters be given equal opportunity to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.
With this understanding, I join the opinion of the Court.

Justice Kennedy, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.

At trial, the plaintiffs alleged that the State violated $ 2 of
the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973, by not creating as many majority-minority districts as was feasible.
The District Court agreed and found a violation of $ 2, thus
equating impermissible vote dilution with the failure to maximize the number of majority-minority districts. I agree
with the Court that the District Court's maximization theory
was an erroneous application of $ 2.

A more difficult question is whether proportionality, ascertained by comparing the number of majority-minority
districts to the minority group's proportion of the relevant
population, is relevant in deciding whether there has been
vote dilution under $ 2 in a challenge to election district
lines. The statutory text does not yield a clear answer.

The statute, in relevant part, provides: "The extent to
which members of a protected class have been elected to

office in the State or political subdivision is one circumstancewhich may be considered [in determining whether there has

been vote dilution]: Provided, That nothing in this sectionestablishes a right to have members of a protected class
elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population." $ 1973(b) (emphasis in original). By its terms, thislanguage addresses the number of minorities elected to office, not the number of districts in which minorities consti-tute a voting majority. These two things are not synonymous, and it would be an affront to our constitutionaltraditions to treat them as such. The assumption that
majority-minority districts elect only minority representatives, or that majority-white districts elect only white representatives, is false as an empirical matter. See Voinovich v.
Quilter, 507 U. S. 146, 151-152, 158 (1993); A. Thernstrom,
Whose Votes Count? Affirmative Action and Minority Voting
Rights 210-216 (1987); C. Swain, Black Faces, Black Interests, ch. 6 (1993). And on a more fundamental level, the
assumption reflects "the demeaning notion that members of
the defined racial groups ascribe to certain `minority views'
that must be different from those of other citizens." Metro
Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 636 (1990) (Kennedy, J., dissenting); see also United Jewish Organizations
of Williamsburgh, Inc. v. Carey, 430 U. S. 144, 186-187 (1977)
(Burger, C. J., dissenting).

Although the statutory text does not speak in precise
terms to the issue, our precedents make clear that proportionality, or the lack thereof, has some relevance to a vote
dilution claim under $ 2. In a unanimous decision last Term,
we recognized that single-member districts were subject to
vote dilution challenges under $ 2, and further that "[d]ividing [a politically cohesive] minority group among various
[single-member] districts so that it is a majority in none" is
one "device for diluting minority voting power" within the
meaning of the statute. Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S., at
152-153. If "the fragmentation of a minority group among

153, it follows that analysis under $ 2 takes some account of
whether the number of majority-minority districts falls short
of a statistical norm. Cf. Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S.
229, 242 (1976) (discriminatory impact relevant to allegation
of intentional discrimination). Both the majority and concurring opinions in Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30 (1986),
reflect the same understanding of the statute. See id., at
50, n. 16 (In a "gerrymander case, plaintiffs might allege that
the minority group that is sufficiently large and compact to
constitute a single-member district has been split between
two or more multimember or single-member districts, with
the effect of diluting the potential strength of the minority
vote"); id., at 84 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment)
("[A]ny theory of vote dilution must necessarily rely to some
extent on a measure of minority voting strength that makes
some reference to the proportion between the minority
group and the electorate at large"). Indeed, to say that proportionality is irrelevant under the $ 2 results test is the
equivalent of saying (contrary to our precedents) that no $ 2
vote dilution challenges can be brought to the drawing of
single-member districts.

To be sure, placing undue emphasis upon proportionality
risks defeating the goals underlying the Voting Rights Act
of 1965, as amended. See Gingles, supra, at 99 (O'Connor,
J., concurring in judgment). As today's decision provides, a
lack of proportionality is "never dispositive" proof of vote
dilution, just as the presence of proportionality "is not a safe
harbor for States [and] does not immunize their election
schemes from $ 2 challenge." Ante, at 1026 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring); see also ante, at 1020-1021, n. 17. But given
our past construction of the statute, I would hesitate to conclude that proportionality has no relevance to the $ 2 inquiry.

It is important to emphasize that the precedents to which
I refer, like today's decision, only construe the statute, and

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
do not purport to assess its constitutional implications. See
Chisom v. Roemer, 501 U. S. 380, 418 (1991) (Kennedy, J.,
dissenting). Operating under the constraints of a statutory
regime in which proportionality has some relevance, States
might consider it lawful and proper to act with the explicit
goal of creating a proportional number of majority-minority
districts in an effort to avoid $ 2 litigation. Likewise, a
court finding a $ 2 violation might believe that the only appropriate remedy is to order the offending State to engage
in race-based redistricting and create a minimum number of
districts in which minorities constitute a voting majority.
The Department of Justice might require (in effect) the same
as a condition of granting preclearance, under $ 5 of the Act,
42 U. S. C. $ 1973c, to a State's proposed legislative redistricting. Those governmental actions, in my view, tend to
entrench the very practices and stereotypes the Equal Protection Clause is set against. See Metro Broadcasting, Inc.
v. FCC, supra, at 636-637 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). As a
general matter, the sorting of persons with an intent to divide by reason of race raises the most serious constitutional
questions.

"The moral imperative of racial neutrality is the driving
force of the Equal Protection Clause." Richmond v. J. A.
Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 518 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Racial classifications "are by their very nature odious to a free people whose
institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality," and
are presumed invalid. Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 643
(1993) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also A. Bickel,
The Morality of Consent 133 (1975). This is true regardless
of "the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular
classification." Croson, supra, at 494 (opinion of O'Connor,
J.); 488 U. S., at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).
Furthermore, "[i]t is axiomatic that racial classifications do
not become legitimate on the assumption that all persons

1030 JOHNSON v. DE GRANDY

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
suffer them in equal degree." Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400,410 (1991); see also

Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, 560
(1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting).These principles apply to the drawing of electoral and

political boundaries. As Justice Douglas, joined by Justice
Goldberg, stated 30 years ago:

"When racial or religious lines are drawn by the State,the multiracial, multireligious communities that our

Constitution seeks to weld together as one become sepa-ratist; antagonisms that relate to race or to religion
rather than to political issues are generated . . . . Since
that system is at war with the democratic ideal, it shouldfind no footing here."

Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U. S.
52, 67 (1964) (dissenting opinion).

In like fashion, Chief Justice Burger observed that the "use
of a mathematical formula" to assure a minimum number ofmajority-minority districts "tends to sustain the existence of

ghettos by promoting the notion that political clout is to begained or maintained by marshaling particular racial, ethnic,
or religious groups in enclaves." United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, 430 U. S., at 186 (dissenting opinion). And
last Term in Shaw, we voiced our agreement with thesesentiments, observing that "[r]acial gerrymandering, even

for remedial purposes, may balkanize us into competing
racial factions; it threatens to carry us further from thegoal of a political system in which race no longer matters--

a goal that the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments em-body, and to which the Nation continues to aspire." 509
U. S., at 657.

Our decision in Shaw alluded to, but did not resolve,
the broad question whether "the intentional creation of
majority-minority districts, without more, always gives rise
to an equal protection claim." Id., at 649 (internal quotation
marks omitted); see also id., at 657. While recognizing that
redistricting differs from many other kinds of state decision512us3$96l 12-28-97 18:02:59 PAGES OPINPGT

1031Cite as: 512 U. S. 997 (1994)
Thomas, J., dissenting
making "in that the legislature always is aware of race whenit draws district lines, just as it is aware of age, economic

status, religion and political persuasion," we stated that "thedifficulty of determining from the face of a single-member
districting plan that it purposefully distinguishes between
voters on the basis of race" does "not mean that a racialgerrymander, once established, should receive less scrutiny

under the Equal Protection Clause than other state legisla-tion classifying citizens by race."

Id., at 646 (emphasis in
original). We went on to hold that "a reapportionmentscheme so irrational on its face that it can be understood only

as an effort to segregate voters into separate voting districtsbecause of their race" must be subject to strict scrutiny
under the Equal Protection Clause. Id., at 658; see also id.,
at 649, 653. Given our decision in Shaw, there is good reason for state and federal officials with responsibilities related
to redistricting, as well as reviewing courts, to recognize
that explicit race-based districting embarks us on a most
dangerous course. It is necessary to bear in mind that redistricting must comply with the overriding demands of the
Equal Protection Clause. But no constitutional claims were
brought here, and the Court's opinion does not address any
constitutional issues. Cf. Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S.,
at 157.

With these observations, I concur in all but Parts III-B-2,
III-B-4, and IV of the Court's opinion and in its judgment.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins,
dissenting.

For the reasons I explain in Holder v. Hall, ante, p. 891, I
would vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand
with instructions to dismiss the actions consolidated in these
cases for failure to state a claim under $ 2 of the Voting
Rights Act of 1965. 42 U. S. C. $ 1973. Each of the actions
consolidated in these cases asserted that Florida's apportionment plan diluted the vote of a minority group. In ac512us3$96n 12-28-97 18:02:59 PAGES OPINPGT

cordance with the views I express in Holder, I would holdthat an apportionment plan is not a "standard, practice, or

procedure" that may be challenged under $ 2. I thereforerespectfully dissent.

Justice Blackmun, dissenting.
Despite alleged procedural problems, I find petitioner's consti-tutional challenge to the gas chamber to be a serious one. Only

four States, Arizona, California, Mississippi, and North Carolina,still use the gas chamber as a method of execution. Its cruelty
has been attested to on more than one occasion. See, e. g., thedissenting opinion of Justice Marshall, joined by Justice Brennan,
in Gray v. Lucas, 463 U. S. 1237, 1240 (1983).

Although I concur in the Court's remand of this case for furtherconsideration in light of the recent decision in Simmons v. South

Carolina, ante, p. 154, I write to note that there remains anotherserious error in this case, one this Court has not reached before
and does not reach today.It is undisputed that petitioner's sentencing jury was given
the very instruction found unconstitutional in McKoy v. NorthCarolina, 494 U. S. 433 (1990). This instruction ran afoul of Mills
v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367 (1988), by requiring that all jurorsagree on the existence of a mitigating circumstance before any

juror could give it effect. The North Carolina Supreme Courtconcluded, however, that this

McKoy error was harmless beyond
a reasonable doubt. 331 N. C. 620, 418 S. E. 2d 169 (1992). The
state court's analysis does not support its conclusion.The State Supreme Court relied on a poll of the sentencing

jurors. In that poll, each juror first was asked:

" `Do you unanimously find from the evidence the existence
of one or more of the following mitigating circumstances?' "
Id., at 626, 418 S. E. 2d, at 172.

Then, for each of 10 mitigating circumstances submitted to thejury, each juror was asked, for example:

"Q: As to the mitigating factors. `Number 1: This murderwas committed while the defendant was under the influence
of mental illness or emotional disturbance. Answer: No.' Isthis your answer?

"A: Yes.
"Q: Do you still assent thereto?
"A: Yes." Ibid.

The State's Supreme Court ruled that, in this context, the question, " `Is this your answer?' " could reasonably be understood only
as asking each juror "Is this your own individual answer?" Id.,
at 627, 418 S. E. 2d, at 173. Our concern, however, is "not what
the State Supreme Court declares the meaning of the [poll question] to be, but rather what a reasonable juror could have understood the [poll question] as meaning." Francis v. Franklin, 471
U. S. 307, 315-316 (1985). It is equally plausible that a reasonable
juror could have interpreted "Is this your answer?" to mean "Is
this your, the jury's, answer?" Since the jurors had been instructed that they could answer "yes" only if they unanimously
agreed, a juror's answer to the poll question easily could have
meant, "Yes, that was our answer, because we could not achieve
unanimity on the existence of that factor." Or even if the juror
was answering for himself, he could be saying "Yes, that was my
answer, but only because I could not get the others unanimously
to agree that this mitigating circumstance existed." Jurors are
presumed to follow their instructions. See, e. g., Yates v. Evatt,
500 U. S. 391, 403 (1991); Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U. S. 200,
211 (1987).

Blackmun, J., concurring1249
Given the ambiguity of the poll, I "cannot say with any de-gree of confidence which interpretation [Price's] jury adopted,"
Mills, 486 U. S., at 383, and consequently, I cannot conclude thatthe McKoy error was harmless. A finding of harmlessness is
warranted only if it appears "beyond a reasonable doubt that theerror complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained."
Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 24 (1967). Because theunanimity instruction preceded and shaped the jury's consideration of mitigating evidence, it may have contributed to theverdict by directing the jury to "examin[e] the evidence with the
wrong question in mind." Yates v. Evatt, 500 U. S., at 413(Scalia, J., concurring). The poll tells us nothing about how
the juror would have voted--either on a particular mitigatingcircumstance or on the ultimate life-or-death question--had he
been instructed that he could give effect to all the mitigatingevidence, as the Constitution requires. Thus, the state court's
analysis does not satisfy the "high standard" of harmlessnessfor federal constitutional error. See Sochor v. Florida, 504 U. S.
527, 541 (1992) (O'Connor, J., concurring); see also Clemons v.Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738 (1990) (remanding a case to state court
for "detailed explanation" and analysis of its conclusion ofharmlessness).

Because the poll does not demonstrate convincingly, much lessbeyond a reasonable doubt, that no juror interpreted the unconstitutional instruction to block consideration of mitigating evi-dence on which the jurors were not unanimous, I do not share
the state court's "confiden[ce]" that the poll "demonstrates un-equivocally" that the instruction did not prevent any juror from
giving weight to any mitigating evidence. See 331 N. C., at 628,418 S. E. 2d, at 173. Concern that the McKoy instruction may
have precluded consideration of relevant mitigating evidence isonly fueled by the North Carolina Supreme Court's acknowledgment "there [wa]s evidence which support[ed] several of the miti-gating circumstances not found by the jury." 331 N. C., at 628,
418 S. E. 2d, at 173. Cf. McNeil v. North Carolina, 494 U. S.1050 (1990) (

Kennedy, J., dissenting from grant of certiorari)(noting that McKoy error may be harmless where the defendant

did not present mitigating evidence).It is true that this is the third time we have remanded this
case for further consideration in light of an intervening deci-sion, again providing the state court the opportunity to consider

remand, if the North Carolina Supreme Court concludes thatthere is Simmons error that requires resentencing, the new sentencing jurors will not receive the now-abandoned McKoy instruc-tion, and the case will be purged of any existing nonharmless
McKoy error. But if petitioner does not receive a new sentenc-ing hearing, I believe the harmlessness of the McKoy error deserves this Court's attention on the next round, notwithstandingpetitioner's previous visits to this Court.

Supreme Court of North Carolina denied discretionary review.The protesters petitioned this Court for review. When their petition first came before us for consideration, we voted to deferdisposition pending the announcement of our judgment in Madsen
v. Women's Health Center, Inc., ante, p. 753, because of the simi-larity of the issues presented in the two cases.

In Part III-E of the Madsen opinion, announced today, we findunconstitutional an injunctive provision--forbidding congregating, picketing, patrolling, and demonstrating within 300 feet ofthe residences of respondents' employees--indistinguishable in
relevant respects from the one that remains in effect in the pres-ent case. The obviously appropriate course of action, therefore,
is to grant the present petition for certiorari, vacate the judgmentbelow, and remand the cause to the North Carolina Court of
Appeals for reconsideration in light of Madsen. That is what weordinarily do with petitions that have been held for the decision
of cases that, in the event, show the petitions to have merit.Instead, the Court chooses to deny the petition for certiorari.
The only conceivable explanation for this decision is that becausethe injunction presently under consideration is temporary, the
North Carolina courts will have the benefit of our Madsen opinionwhen they come to decide whether a permanent injunction should
issue. But if that fact alone justifies denial of the petition, weshould have denied it at the outset, rather than held it pending
Madsen.No possible resolution of Madsen could have shown this case
more flatly wrong than the opinion that issued. By holding thepetition for Madsen, and then, in light of Madsen, letting the
challenged injunction stand, we send a confusing message to theNorth Carolina courts. And also, of course, we leave a clear
judicial abridgment of petitioners' First Amendment rights in ef-fect. For these reasons, I dissent from the denial of certiorari.

other young man stuffed her panties down her throat with a stick.When I announced in Callins v. Collins, 510 U. S. 1141, 1143
(1994) (opinion dissenting from denial of certiorari), that I hadreached the conclusion that the death penalty, as currently administered, is unconstitutional, Justice Scalia questioned why Idid not choose Buddy McCollum's case as the vehicle to announce
that position. Id., at 1142-1143 (Scalia, J., concurring in denialof certiorari). He seemed to believe that my position would be
harder to defend in a case like this one that "cries out for punish-ment." 334 N. C. 208, 245, 433 S. E. 2d 144, 165 (1993) (Exum,
C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Far from it.The crime indeed is abhorrent, but there is more to the story.

Buddy McCollum is mentally retarded. He has an IQ between60 and 69 and the mental age of a 9-year-old. He reads on a
second-grade level. This factor alone persuades me that thedeath penalty in his case is unconstitutional. See

Penry v.Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 350 (1989) (
Stevens, J., concurring in
part and dissenting in part) (executions of the mentally retardedare unconstitutional).

The sentencing jury found two aggravating circumstances: that
the murder was committed to avoid arrest and that the murderwas especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel. It found seven mitigating circumstances: that McCollum was mentally retarded, thathe had difficulty thinking clearly under stress, that he was easily
influenced by others, that he committed the felony murder underthe influence of mental or emotional disturbance, that he had
cooperated with the police, that he had no significant history of
prior criminal activity, and that he had adapted well to prison.In addition, the trial judge concluded that "[a]ll of the evidence

tends to show that [McCollum's] capacity . . . to appreciate thecriminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was impaired." App. to Pet. for Cert. 50.
McCollum was 19 at the time of the crime.Along with these compelling mitigating circumstances, the evidence at trial tended to show that Buddy McCollum was far fromthe most culpable of the four accomplices. He was not the one
who initiated the rape, the one who proposed the murder, or theone who actually committed the murder. Nonetheless, he was
the only one convicted of murder and the only one sentenced
to die.

North Carolina's death penalty scheme requires appellate pro-portionality review, N. C. Gen. Stat. $ 15A-2000(d)(2) (1988), and
the Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court foundhimself compelled to conclude that the death penalty for Buddy
McCollum was disproportionate. 334 N. C., at 248-250, 433 S. E.2d, at 167-168 (Exum, C. J., dissenting). North Carolina jurors
had never before recommended death for a defendant whom theyhad found mentally retarded. Only once had jurors recommended
death where there was even any evidence of mental retardation.No North Carolina jury ever had recommended death for a felony
murderer under 20 years of age. Nor had any jury recommendeddeath in a sexual offense felony murder where there was evidence
of the defendant's mental and emotional disturbance, not evenwhere the defendant was the actual perpetrator of an especially
heinous, atrocious, or cruel killing.That our system of capital punishment would single out Buddy
McCollum to die for this brutal crime only confirms my conclu-sion that the death penalty experiment has failed. Our system
of capital punishment simply does not accurately and consistentlydetermine which defendants most "deserve" to die.

No. 93-8040. McFarland v. Scott, Director, Texas De-partment of Criminal Justice, Institutional Division.
C. A. 5th Cir. Certiorari denied. Reported below: 8 F. 3d 256.

Justice Blackmun, dissenting.
Today in McFarland v. Scott, ante, p. 849, this Court addressedthe right to qualified legal counsel guaranteed to all capital defendants in federal habeas corpus proceedings. See 21 U. S. C.$ 848(q)(4)(B). More often than not, however, it is in the proceedings antecedent to federal habeas corpus--the capital trial, andto a lesser extent state postconviction proceedings--that a capital
defendant's case is won or lost. Frequently the legal counselavailable to capital defendants at these critical stages is woefully
inadequate. I therefore write to address the crisis in trial andstate postconviction legal representation for capital defendants
that forms the backdrop to the federal right to counsel affordedby $ 848(q)(4)(B).

Without question, "the principal failings of the capital punish-ment review process today are the inadequacy and inadequate
compensation of counsel at trial and the unavailability of counselin state post-conviction proceedings." Robbins, Toward a More

Just and Effective System of Review in State Death PenaltyCases, Report of the American Bar Association's Recommendations Concerning Death Penalty Habeas Corpus, 40 Am. U. L.Rev. 1, 16 (1990) (ABA Report). The unique, bifurcated nature
of capital trials and the special investigation into a defendant'spersonal history and background that may be required, the complexity and fluidity of the law, and the high, emotional stakesinvolved all make capital cases more costly and difficult to litigate
than ordinary criminal trials. Yet, the attorneys assigned to rep-resent indigent capital defendants at times are less qualified than
those appointed in ordinary criminal cases. See Green, LethalFiction: The Meaning of `Counsel' in the Sixth Amendment, 78
Iowa L. Rev. 433, 434 (1993); Coyle, et al., Fatal Defense, 12 Nat.L. J. 30, 44 (June 11, 1990) (Capital-defense attorneys in eight
States were disbarred, suspended, or disciplined at rates 3 to 46times higher than the general attorney-discipline rates).

Two factors contribute to the general unavailability of qualifiedattorneys to represent capital defendants. The absence of standards governing court-appointed capital-defense counsel meansthat unqualified lawyers often are appointed, and the absence
of funds to compensate lawyers prevents even qualified lawyersfrom being able to present an adequate defense. Many States
that regularly impose the death penalty have few, if any, stand-ards governing the qualifications required of court-appointed
capital-defense counsel. In 21 U. S. C. $$ 848(q)(5) and (6), Con-gress has required that attorneys appointed to represent capital
defendants in federal habeas corpus proceedings must have fiveyears of experience litigating before the relevant court and three
years of felony experience. See McFarland, ante, at 854, n. 2.According to a 1990 survey by the National Law Journal, however, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Texas, and California have nobinding statewide qualification criteria for capital-defense counsel.
See Coyle, 12 Nat. L. J., at 32. Capital-defense attorneys in Loui-siana must have five years' experience practicing in some area
of law, but are not required to have experience in capital defenseor any form of criminal practice. Ibid.

In addition to the lack of standards, compensation for attorneysrepresenting indigent capital defendants often is perversely low.
Although a properly conducted capital trial can involve hundredsof hours of investigation, preparation, and lengthy trial proceedings, many States severely limit the compensation paid for capital

defense. Louisiana limits the compensation for court-appointedcapital-defense counsel to $1,000 for all pretrial preparation and
trial proceedings. Kentucky pays a maximum of $2,500 for thesame services. Alabama limits reimbursement for out-of-court
preparation in capital cases to a maximum of $1,000 each for thetrial and penalty phases. Ala. Code $ 15-12-21(a) (Supp. 1992);
Op. Ala. Atty. Gen. No. 91-00206 (Mar. 21, 1991). See generallyKlein, The Eleventh Commandment: Thou Shalt Not Be Compelled to Render the Ineffective Assistance of Counsel, 68 Ind.L. J. 363, 364-375 (1993).

Court-awarded funds for the appointment of investigators andexperts often are either unavailable, severely limited, or not provided by state courts. As a result, attorneys appointed to rep-resent capital defendants at the trial level frequently are unable
to recoup even their overhead costs and out-of-pocket expenses,
and effectively may be required to work at minimum wage orbelow while funding from their own pockets their client's defense.

A recent survey by the Mississippi Trial Lawyers' Associationestimated that capital-defense attorneys in that State are compensated at an average rate of $11.75 per hour. See Coyle, 12 Nat.L. J., at 32. Compensation rates of $5 per hour or less are not
uncommon. Strasser, $1,000 Fee Cap Makes Death Row's `Justice' A Bargain for the State, 12 Nat. L. J. 33 (June 11, 1990).1The prospect that hours spent in trial preparation or funds expended hiring psychiatrists or ballistics experts will be uncom-pensated unquestionably chills even a qualified attorney's zealous
representation of his client.

1 Recent improvements have been made, however. The Florida Supreme
Court struck down the State's maximum fee of $3,500 as unconstitutionalwhen applied in such a manner as to impinge on the right to effective counsel in capital cases. White v. Board of County Comm'rs, 537 So. 2d 1376(1989). The court found itself "hard pressed to find any capital case in
which the circumstances would not warrant an award of attorneys' fees inexcess of the [$3,500] fee cap." Id., at 1378. South Carolina's Supreme
Court also refused, on Sixth Amendment grounds, to enforce the State's $10and $15 per hour and $5,000 maximum compensation levels in capital cases.
Bailey v. State, 424 S. E. 2d 503, 508 (1992). The Oklahoma and ArkansasSupreme Courts recently struck down their States' respective compensation
caps of $3,200 and $1,000 as unconstitutional takings when applied to capitalcases. See State v. Lynch, 796 P. 2d 1150 (Okla. 1990); Arnold v. Kemp, 306
Ark. 294, 813 S. W. 2d 770 (1991).

Blackmun, J., dissenting1256
The practical costs of such ad hoc systems of attorney selectionand compensation are well documented. Capital defendants have
been sentenced to death when represented by counsel who neverbothered to read the state death penalty statute,

e. g., Smith v.State, 581 So. 2d 497 (Ala. Crim. App. 1990), slept through or

otherwise were not present during trial, or failed to investigateor present any mitigating evidence at the penalty phase, Mitchell
v. Kemp, 483 U. S. 1026 (1987) (Marshall, J., dissenting from denialof certiorari). Other indigent defendants have been represented
by attorneys who had been admitted to the bar only six monthsbefore and never had conducted a criminal trial.

E. g., Paradisv. Arave, 954 F. 2d 1483, 1490-1491 (CA9 1992), vacated and remanded, 507 U. S. 1026 (1993), relief denied, 20 F. 3d 950, 959(1994). One Louisiana defendant was convicted of capital murder
following a 1-day trial and 20-minute penalty phase proceeding,in which his counsel stipulated to the defendant's age at the time
of the crime and rested. State v. Messiah, 538 So. 2d 175, 187
(La. 1988), cert. denied, 493 U. S. 1063 (1990). When asked tocite the criminal cases he knew, one defense attorney who failed

to challenge his client's racially unrepresentative jury pool could
name only two cases: Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966),and

Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393 (1857). See Bright,
Counsel for the Poor: The Death Sentence Not for the WorstCrime but for the Worst Lawyer, 103 Yale L. J. 1835, 1839, and

n. 32 (1994), citing Tr. of Hearing 231 (Apr. 25-27, 1988) in Statev.

Birt, No. 2360 (Super. Ct. Jefferson Cty., Ga. 1988).
The consequences of such poor trial representation for the capital defendant, of course, can be lethal. Evidence not presentedat trial cannot later be discovered and introduced; arguments and

objections not advanced are forever waived. Nor is a capitaldefendant likely to be able to demonstrate that his legal counsel
was ineffective, given the low standard for acceptable attorney
conduct and the high showing of prejudice required under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Ten years after the
articulation of that standard, practical experience establishes thatthe

Strickland test, in application, has failed to protect a defendant's right to be represented by something more than "a personwho happens to be a lawyer."

Id., at 685.
The impotence of the Strickland standard is perhaps best evidenced in the cases in which ineffective-assistance claims have

been denied. John Young, for example, was represented in hiscapital trial by an attorney who was addicted to drugs and who
a few weeks later was incarcerated on federal drug charges. TheCourt of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit rejected Young's
ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim on federal habeas, Young v.
Kemp, 727 F. 2d 1489 (1984), and this Court denied review, 470U. S. 1009 (1985). Young was executed in 1985. John Smith and

his codefendant Rebecca Machetti were sentenced to death byjuries selected under the same Georgia statute. Machetti's attorneys successfully challenged the statute under a recent SupremeCourt decision,

Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522 (1975), winningMachetti a new trial and ultimately a life sentence. Machetti v.

Linahan, 679 F. 2d 236 (CA11 1982). Smith's counsel was un-aware of the Supreme Court decision, however, and failed similarly to object at trial. Smith v. Kemp, 715 F. 2d 1459 (CA111983). Smith was executed in 1983.

Jesus Romero's attorney failed to present any evidence at the
penalty phase and delivered a closing argument totaling 29 words.Although the attorney later was suspended on unrelated grounds,

Romero's ineffective-assistance claim was rejected by the Court
of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Romero v. Lynaugh, 884 F. 2d871, 875 (1989), and this Court denied certiorari, 494 U. S. 1012

(1990). Romero was executed in 1992. Larry Heath was repre-sented on direct appeal by counsel who filed a 6-page brief before
the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals. The attorney failed toappear for oral argument before the Alabama Supreme Court and
filed a brief in that court containing a 1-page argument and citing
a single case. The Eleventh Circuit found no prejudice, Heath v.
Jones, 941 F. 2d 1126, 1131 (1991), and this Court denied review,
502 U. S. 1077 (1992). Heath was executed in Alabama in 1992.James Messer, a mentally impaired capital defendant, was represented by an attorney who at the trial's guilt phase presented
no defense, made no objections, and emphasized the horror of thecapital crime in his closing statement. At the penalty phase, the

attorney presented no evidence of mental impairment, failed tointroduce other substantial mitigating evidence, and again repeatedly suggested in closing that death was the appropriate punish-ment. The Eleventh Circuit refused to grant relief,

cuted in 1988. Even the attorney who could name only Mirandaand Dred Scott twice has survived ineffective-assistance challenges. See Birt v. Montgomery, 725 F. 2d 587, 596-601 (CA11)(en banc), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 874 (1984); Williams v. State,
258 Ga. 281, 368 S. E. 2d 742 (1988), cert. denied, 492 U. S. 925(1989).

2 None of these cases inspires confidence that the adversarial system functioned properly or "that the trial ca[n] be reliedon as having produced a just result." Strickland, 466 U. S., at

686. Yet, in none of these cases was counsel's assistance foundto be ineffective.

Regardless of the quality of counsel, capital defendants constitu-tionally are entitled to have some "person who happens to be a
lawyer . . . present at trial alongside the accused." Id., at 685.The same cannot be said for state postconviction review. State
habeas corpus proceedings are a vital link in the capital reviewprocess, not the least because all federal habeas claims first must
be adequately raised in state court. This Court thus far hasdeclined to hold that indigent capital defendants have a right to
counsel at this level, based on the assumption that capital defend-ants generally can obtain volunteer or other counsel to represent
them in these state proceedings. Murray v. Giarratano, 492U. S. 1, 14 (1989) (

Kennedy, J., joined by O'Connor, J., concur-ring in judgment) (In "the case before us . . . no prisoner on

death row in Virginia has been unable to obtain counsel to repre-sent him in postconviction proceedings").

Though perhaps true for some jurisdictions, this assumptionbears little resemblance to the realities confronting McFarland
and other condemned inmates in Texas. A recent study of statepostconviction capital representation in Texas sponsored by the
State Bar of Texas concluded that the capital-defense situation inthat State is "desperate." The Spangenberg Group, A Study of
Representation in Capital Cases in Texas, ii (Mar. 1993). Accord-ing to the Spangenberg Group, "Texas has already reached the
crisis stage in capital representation and . . . the problem issubstantially worse than that faced by any other state with the
death penalty." Id., at i.

defense representation, see, e. g., Bright, Counsel for the Poor: The DeathSentence Not for the Worst Crime but for the Worst Lawyer, 103 Yale L. J.

Blackmun, J., dissenting 512 U. S.
Texas has the second largest death row in the country, withapproximately 375 inmates currently facing execution. Since
1976, Texas has executed approximately one third of all the de-fendants put to death in the United States, NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., Death Row, U. S. A., 10 (spring1994), and the pace of executions in Texas is increasing. In June
1993, this Court denied certiorari in an unprecedented 29 capitalcases from Texas, including McFarland's. During the ensuing
period between June 1 and October 21, 1993, Texas scheduled39 executions and actually executed 10 capital defendants. All
told, the Lone Star State set more than 100 execution dates in1993, at least 8 of which were set within 45 days of the close of
direct review.Finding qualified defense counsel capable of meeting this demand might be formidable even if an adequate pool of attor-neys and adequate funds were available. Capital defendants in
Texas, however, have no statutory right to counsel in state postconviction proceedings, receive little benefit from the State's skel-etal public defender service, and are not provided even discretionary court-appointed counsel. Although the Texas Code of
Criminal Procedure, Arts. 11.07, 26.04, 26.05, gives state courtsdiscretion to appoint and compensate counsel for state habeas

corpus proceedings, "this is almost never done." SpangenbergGroup, at vii. Funds for experts and other expenses also "are
almost never approved." Ibid. Indeed, the Texas Bar studyfound that "[p]resently no funds are allocated for payment of counsel or litigation expenses at the state habeas level." Spangenberg Group, at ii. Capital defendants in state postconvictionproceedings must rely almost exclusively on volunteer private

counsel--volunteers who are increasingly difficult to find. Texasthus has become "the only death penalty state in which deathsentenced prisoners are not routinely represented in state postconviction proceedings." Brief for American Bar Associationas

Amicus Curiae, McFarland v. Scott, No. 93-6497, p. 3, and
n. 9. The lack of attorney compensation and Texas' aggressivepractice of "[d]ocket control by execution date," Jones, Death

Penalty Procedures: A Proposal for Reform, 53 Tex. Bar J. 850,851 (1990), have left an estimated 75 capital defendants in Texas
who currently are facing execution dates without any legal
representation.

Blackmun, J., dissenting1256
The right to qualified legal counsel in federal habeas corpusproceedings bestowed by $ 848(q)(4)(B) is triggered only after a
capital defendant has completed his direct review and, generally,some form of state postconviction proceeding. The continuing
importance of federal habeas corpus in correcting constitutionalerrors is well documented. Of the capital cases reviewed in federal habeas corpus proceedings between 1976 and 1991, nearlyhalf (46%) were found to have constitutional error. Liebman,
More than `Slightly Retro:' The Rehnquist Court's Rout of HabeasCorpus Jurisdiction in Teague v. Lane, 18 N. Y. U. Rev. L. & Soc.
Change 537, 541, n. 15 (1990-1991). The total reversal rate ofcapital cases at all stages of review during the same time period
was estimated at 60% or more. Id., at 541, n. 15; see also Murrayv. Giarratano, 492 U. S., at 23-24, and n. 13 (Stevens, J., joined
by Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting) (citing afederal habeas corpus success rate of 60% to 70% in capital cases,
versus 0.25% to 7% in noncapital cases); id., at 14 (Kennedy, J.,joined by

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). This Courtitself frequently has granted capital defendants relief in federal

habeas corpus proceedings. See, e. g., Parker v. Dugger, 498 U. S.308 (1991); Yates v. Evatt, 500 U. S. 391 (1991); Yates v. Aiken,
484 U. S. 211 (1988); Yates v. Aiken, 474 U. S. 896 (1985); Penryv. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (1989); Amadeo v. Zant, 486 U. S. 214
(1988); Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356 (1988); Johnson v.Mississippi, 486 U. S. 578 (1988); Hitchcock v. Dugger, 481 U. S.
393 (1987); Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399 (1986).The mere presence of "[s]uch a high incidence of uncorrected
error" found in capital habeas corpus proceedings, Murray v.Giarratano, 492 U. S., at 24 (Stevens, J., joined by Brennan,
Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting), testifies to the inade-quacy of the legal representation afforded at the trial and state
postconviction stages. Yet the barriers to relief in federal habeascorpus proceedings are high. Even the best lawyers cannot rectify a meritorious constitutional claim that has been procedurallydefaulted or waived by prior inadequate counsel. The accumulating and often byzantine restrictions this Court has imposedon federal habeas corpus review, see, e. g., Herrera v. Collins,
506 U. S. 390 (1993); Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333 (1992);Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1 (1992); Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991); McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991);Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407 (1990); Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S.

June 30, 1994 512 U. S.
288 (1989), make it even less likely that future capital defendantswho receive qualified legal counsel in federal habeas actually will
obtain relief. And it is the capital defendant who pays the pricefor the failings of counsel and this review process--generally with
his life.Our system of justice is adversarial and depends for its legitimacy on the fair and adequate representation of all parties atall levels of the judicial process. The trial is the main event in
this system, where the prosecution and the defense do battle toreach a presumptively reliable result. When we execute a capital defendant in this country, we rely on the belief that the indi-vidual was guilty, and was convicted and sentenced after a fair
trial, to justify the imposition of state-sponsored killing. Andwhen this Court curtails federal oversight of state-court proceedings, it does so in reliance on the proposition that justice has beendone at the trial level. My 24 years of overseeing the imposition
of the death penalty from this Court have left me in grave doubtwhether this reliance is justified and whether the constitutional
requirement of competent legal counsel for capital defendants isbeing fulfilled. It is my hope and belief that this Nation soon
will come to realize that capital punishment cannot morally orconstitutionally be imposed. Until that time, however, we must
have the courage to recognize the failings of our present systemof capital representation and the conviction to do what is necessary to improve it.Adhering to my belief that the death penalty cannot be imposed fairly within the constraints of our Constitution, Callins v.Collins, 510 U. S. 1141, 1143 (1994) (Blackmun, J., dissenting),
I would grant the petition for certiorari and vacate the deathsentence.

OPINION OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICE

IN CHAMBERS

EDWARDS, GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA, et al. v.

HOPE MEDICAL GROUP FOR WOMEN et al.

on application for stay
No. A-124. Decided August 17, 1994
An application to stay the District Court's order is denied. That court

enjoined applicants, Louisiana officials, from enforcing a state law prohibiting the use of public funds for abortion except when medically necessary to prevent the mother's death, finding that the law is inconsistent
with what the court termed the requirement of Title XIX of the Social
Security Act that States participating in the Medicaid program fund
abortions for women whose fetuses were conceived by acts of rape or
incest. The premise that Title XIX requires participating States to
fund abortions unless federal funding for those procedures is proscribed
by the Hyde Amendment has been uniformly supported by those Courts
of Appeals that have addressed this question. It is certain that four
Justices will not be found to vote for certiorari on this question until
there is a Circuit conflict.

Justice Scalia, Circuit Justice.
Applicants, officers of the State of Louisiana, ask that I
stay an order entered by the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of Louisiana which enjoins them
from enforcing La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 40:1299.34.5 (West 1992)
while at the same time accepting federal Medicaid funds pursuant to Title XIX of the Social Security Act, as added, 79
Stat. 343, 42 U. S. C. $ 1396 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. IV).
The District Court stayed its judgment until 5 p.m. on August 19, 1994. Yesterday, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit unanimously denied the applicants' motion for stay
pending appeal.

1302 EDWARDS v. HOPE MEDICAL GROUP FOR WOMEN

Opinion in Chambers
Section 40:1299.34.5 provides in relevant part:

"[N]o public funds . . . shall be used in any way for, to
assist in, or to provide facilities for an abortion, exceptwhen the abortion is medically necessary to prevent the

death of the mother."
The District Court concluded that this statute was inconsist-ent with what it determined to be the requirement of Title

XIX, as modified by the 1994 version of the Hyde Amendment, Pub. L. 103-112, $ 509, 107 Stat. 1113, that States par-ticipating in the Medicaid program fund medically necessary

abortions upon fetuses conceived by acts of rape or incest.Accordingly, it ordered applicants either to cease enforcing

$ 40:1299.34.5 or to withdraw from participation in the Medic-aid program.

Hope Medical Group for Women v. Edwards,
No. 94-1129 (ED La., July 28, 1994).

The practice of the Justices has consistently been to granta stay only when three conditions obtain. There must be

a reasonable probability that certiorari will be granted, asignificant possibility that the judgment below will be reversed, and a likelihood of irreparable harm (assuming theapplicants' position is correct) if the judgment below is not
stayed. Barnes v. E-Systems, Inc. Group Hospital Medical & Surgical Ins. Plan, 501 U. S. 1301, 1302 (1991) (Scalia,
J., in chambers). Moreover, when a district court judgment
is reviewable by a court of appeals that has denied a motionfor a stay, the applicant seeking an overriding stay from

this Court bears "an especially heavy burden," Packwood v.
Senate Select Comm. on Ethics, 510 U. S. 1319, 1320 (1994)
(Rehnquist, C. J., in chambers).

Under this standard, I have no authority to stay the judgment here. The only issue potentially worthy of certiorari
is the premise underlying the District Court's decision: that
Title XIX requires States participating in the Medicaid program to fund abortions (at least "medically necessary" ones)
unless federal funding for those procedures is proscribed by

1303Cite as: 512 U. S. 1301 (1994)
Opinion in Chambers
the Hyde Amendment. The Courts of Appeals to addressthis question have uniformly supported that premise. See

Roe v. Casey, 623 F. 2d 829, 831, 834 (CA3 1980); Hodgson v.Board of County Comm'rs of Hennepin, 614 F. 2d 601, 611
(CA8 1980); Zbaraz v. Quern, 596 F. 2d 196, 199 (CA7 1979),cert. denied, 448 U. S. 907 (1980);

Preterm, Inc. v. Dukakis,591 F. 2d 121, 126-127, 134 (CA1), cert. denied, 441 U. S. 952

(1979). We have already denied certiorari in two of thosecases, and it is in my view a certainty that four Justices will
not be found to vote for certiorari on the Title XIX questionunless and until a conflict in the Circuits appears.

Accordingly, the application for a stay of the judgment ofthe District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana is
denied.
