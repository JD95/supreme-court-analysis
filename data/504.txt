CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 1991

KEENEY, SUPERINTENDENT, OREGON STATEPENITENTIARY v. TAMAYO-REYES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 90-1859. Argued January 15, 1992--Decided May 4, 1992
In collateral state-court proceedings, respondent, a Cuban immigrant with

little education and almost no knowledge of English, alleged, inter alia,
that his plea of nolo contendere to first-degree manslaughter had not
been knowing and intelligent and therefore was invalid because his
court-appointed translator had not translated accurately and completely
for him the mens rea element of the crime in question. The state court
dismissed the petition after a hearing, the Oregon Court of Appeals
affirmed, the State Supreme Court denied review, and the Federal
District Court denied respondent habeas corpus relief. However, the
Court of Appeals held that he was entitled to a federal evidentiary hearing on the question whether the mens rea element of the crime was
properly explained to him, since the record disclosed that the material
facts concerning the translation were not adequately developed at the
state-court hearing, see Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 313, and since
postconviction counsel's negligent failure to develop those facts did not
constitute a deliberate bypass of the orderly procedure of the state
courts, see id., at 317; Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 438.

Held: A cause-and-prejudice standard, rather than Fay's deliberate bypass standard, is the correct standard for excusing a habeas petitioner's
failure to develop a material fact in state-court proceedings. Townsend's holding that the Fay standard is applicable in a case like this
must be overruled in light of more recent decisions involving, like Fay, a

Syllabus
state procedural default, in which this Court has rejected the deliberate
bypass standard in favor of a standard of cause and prejudice. See,
e. g., Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 87-88, and n. 12; Coleman v.
Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 751. It would be irrational to distinguish between failing to properly assert a federal claim in state court and failing
in state court to properly develop such a claim, and to apply to the latter
a remnant of a decision that is no longer upheld with regard to the
former. Moreover, the concerns of finality, comity, judicial economy,
and channeling the resolution of claims into the most appropriate forum
that motivated the rejection of the Fay standard in the state procedural
default cases are equally applicable to this case. Finally, applying the
cause-and-prejudice standard here also advances uniformity in habeas
corpus law. Thus, respondent is entitled to a federal evidentiary hearing if he can show cause for his failure to develop the facts in the statecourt proceedings and actual prejudice resulting from that failure, or if
he can show that a fundamental miscarriage of justice would result from
failure to hold such a hearing. See, e. g., McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S.

Opinion of the Court
Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court.
Respondent is a Cuban immigrant with little education and
almost no knowledge of English. In 1984, he was charged
with murder arising from the stabbing death of a man who
had allegedly attempted to intervene in a confrontation between respondent and his girlfriend in a bar.

Respondent was provided with a defense attorney and interpreter. The attorney recommended to respondent that
he plead nolo contendere to first-degree manslaughter. Ore.
Rev. Stat. $ 163.118(1)(a) (1987). Respondent signed a plea
form that explained in English the rights he was waiving by
entering the plea. The state court held a plea hearing, at
which petitioner was represented by counsel and his interpreter. The judge asked the attorney and interpreter if
they had explained to respondent the rights in the plea form
and the consequences of his plea; they responded in the affirmative. The judge then explained to respondent, in English, the rights he would waive by his plea, and asked the
interpreter to translate. Respondent indicated that he understood his rights and still wished to plead nolo contendere.
The judge accepted his plea.

Later, respondent brought a collateral attack on the plea
in a state-court proceeding. He alleged his plea had not
been knowing and intelligent and therefore was invalid because his translator had not translated accurately and completely for him the mens rea element of manslaughter. He
also contended that he did not understand the purposes of
the plea form or the plea hearing. He contended that he did
not know he was pleading no contest to manslaughter, but
rather that he thought he was agreeing to be tried for
manslaughter.

4 KEENEY v. TAMAYO-REYES

Opinion of the Court
After a hearing, the state court dismissed respondent's pe-tition, finding that respondent was properly served by his

trial interpreter and that the interpreter correctly, fully, andaccurately translated the communications between respondent and his attorney. App. 51. The State Court of Appealsaffirmed, and the State Supreme Court denied review.

Respondent then entered Federal District Court seekinga writ of habeas corpus. Respondent contended that the
material facts concerning the translation were not ade-quately developed at the state-court hearing, implicating the
fifth circumstance of Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 313(1963), and sought a federal evidentiary hearing on whether
his nolo contendere plea was unconstitutional. The DistrictCourt found that the failure to develop the critical facts relevant to his federal claim was attributable to inexcusable ne-glect and that no evidentiary hearing was required. App.
to Pet. for Cert. 37, 38. Respondent appealed.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recognized that
the alleged failure to translate the mens rea element of first-degree manslaughter, if proved, would be a basis for overturning respondent's plea, 926 F. 2d 1492, 1494 (1991), anddetermined that material facts had not been adequately developed in the state postconviction court, id., at 1500, appar-ently due to the negligence of postconviction counsel. The
court held that Townsend v. Sain, supra, at 317, and Fay v.
Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 438 (1963), required an evidentiary hear-ing in the District Court unless respondent had deliberately

bypassed the orderly procedure of the state courts. Be-cause counsel's negligent failure to develop the facts did not
constitute a deliberate bypass, the Court of Appeals ruledthat respondent was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on
the question whether the mens rea element of first-degreemanslaughter was properly explained to him. 926 F. 2d, at
1502.1

1 With respect to respondent's claim that the plea form and plea proceeding were not adequately translated, the Court of Appeals concluded that
state postconviction proceedings afforded petitioner ample opportunity to

Opinion of the Court
We granted certiorari to decide whether the deliberate by-pass standard is the correct standard for excusing a habeas

petitioner's failure to develop a material fact in state-courtproceedings. 502 U. S. 807 (1991). We reverse.

Because the holding of Townsend v. Sain that Fay v.
Noia's deliberate bypass standard is applicable in a case likethis had not been reversed, it is quite understandable that

the Court of Appeals applied that standard in this case. How-ever, in light of more recent decisions of this Court, Townsend's holding in this respect must be overruled.2 Fay v.
contest the translations, that the material facts surrounding these issues
were adequately developed, and that the state court's findings were adequately supported by the record. The Court of Appeals therefore held
that a federal evidentiary hearing on that claim was not required. 926
F. 2d, at 1502.

2 Justice O'Connor asserts that Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293

(1963), insofar as relevant to this case, merely reflected existing law.
The claim thus seems to be that the general rule stated by the Court
in Townsend governing when an evidentiary hearing must be granted to
a federal habeas corpus petitioner, as well as each of the Court's six
criteria particularizing its general pronouncement, reflected what was
to be found in prior holdings of the Court. This is a very doubtful
claim. Surely the Court at that time did not think this was the case,
for it pointedly observed that prior cases had not settled all aspects of the
hearing problem in habeas proceedings and that the lower federal courts
had reached widely divergent and irreconcilable results in dealing with
hearing issues. Id., at 310, and n. 8. Hence it deemed it advisable to
give further guidance to the lower courts. It also expressly stated that
the rules it was announcing "must be considered to supersede, to the
extent of any inconsistencies, the opinions in Brown v. Allen[, 344 U. S.
443 (1953)]." Id., at 312. This was necessary because Brown was inconsistent with the holding of Townsend regarding habeas petitioners
who failed to adequately develop federal claims in state-court proceedings. See Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 465 (1953) (federal court
may deny writ without rehearing of facts "where the legality of [the]
detention has been determined, on the facts presented," by the state
court) (emphasis added); id., at 463 (writ should be refused, without more,
if federal court satisfied from the record that "state process has given
fair consideration to the issues and the offered evidence") (emphasis
added). We have unequivocally acknowledged that Townsend substantially changed the availability of evidentiary hearings in federal

6 KEENEY v. TAMAYO-REYES

Opinion of the Court
Noia was itself a case where the habeas petitioner had nottaken advantage of state remedies by failing to appeal--a

procedural default case. Since that time, however, thisCourt has rejected the deliberate bypass standard in state
procedural default cases and has applied instead a standardof cause and prejudice.

In Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S. 536 (1976), we acknowl-edged a federal court's power to entertain an application for
habeas even where the claim has been procedurally waivedin state proceedings, but nonetheless examined the appropriateness of the exercise of that power and recognized, as wehad in

Fay, that considerations of comity and concerns forthe orderly administration of criminal justice may in some

circumstances require a federal court to forgo the exerciseof its habeas corpus power. 425 U. S., at 538-539. We held
that a federal habeas petitioner is required to show causefor his procedural default, as well as actual prejudice.

Id.,at 542.

In Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72 (1977), we rejectedthe application of

Fay's standard of "knowing waiver" or"deliberate bypass" to excuse a petitioner's failure to comply

with a state contemporaneous-objection rule, stating that thestate rule deserved more respect than the Fay standard accorded it. 433 U. S., at 88. We observed that proceduralrules that contribute to error-free state trial proceedings
are thoroughly desirable. We applied a cause-and-prejudicestandard to a petitioner's failure to object at trial and limited

habeas proceedings. See Smith v. Yeager, 393 U. S. 122, 125 (1968) (per
curiam).

It is not surprising, then, that none of the cases cited by Justice O'Connor remotely support Townsend's requirement for a hearing in any case
where the "material facts were not adequately developed at the statecourt hearing" due to petitioner's own neglect. 372 U. S., at 313. Finally, it is undeniable that Fay v. Noia's deliberate bypass standard overruled prior procedural default cases, and it is no less true that Townsend's
adoption of that standard as a definition of "inexcusable neglect" made
new law.

Opinion of the Court
Fay to its facts. 433 U. S., at 87-88, and n. 12. We haveconsistently reaffirmed that the "cause-and-prejudice" standard embodies the correct accommodation between the com-peting concerns implicated in a federal court's habeas power.
Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1, 11 (1984); Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S.
107, 129 (1982).In

McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991), we held that
the same standard used to excuse state procedural defaultsshould be applied in habeas corpus cases where abuse of the

writ is claimed by the government. Id., at 493. This con-clusion rested on the fact that the two doctrines are similar
in purpose and design and implicate similar concerns. Id.,
at 493-494. The writ strikes at finality of a state criminal
conviction, a matter of particular importance in a federal system. Id., at 491, citing Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 487

(1986). Federal habeas litigation also places a heavy burden
on scarce judicial resources, may give litigants incentives to
withhold claims for manipulative purposes, and may create
disincentives to present claims when evidence is fresh. 499
U. S., at 491-492. See also Reed v. Ross, supra, at 13; Wainwright, supra, at 89.

Again addressing the issue of state procedural default in
Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), we described
Fay as based on a conception of federal/state relations
that undervalued the importance of state procedural rules,
501 U. S., at 750, and went on to hold that the cause-andprejudice standard applicable to failure to raise a particular
claim should apply as well to failure to appeal at all. Ibid.
"All of the State's interests--in channeling the resolution of
claims to the most appropriate forum, in finality, and in having an opportunity to correct its own errors--are implicated
whether a prisoner defaults one claim or all of them." Id.,
at 750. We therefore applied the cause-and-prejudice standard uniformly to state procedural defaults, eliminating the
"irrational" distinction between Fay and subsequent cases.
501 U. S., at 751. In light of these decisions, it is similarly

8 KEENEY v. TAMAYO-REYES

Opinion of the Court
irrational to distinguish between failing to properly assert a
federal claim in state court and failing in state court to properly develop such a claim, and to apply to the latter a remnant of a decision that is no longer upheld with regard to
the former.

The concerns that motivated the rejection of the deliberate bypass standard in Wainwright, Coleman, and other
cases are equally applicable to this case.3 As in cases of
state procedural default, application of the cause-andprejudice standard to excuse a state prisoner's failure to develop material facts in state court will appropriately accommodate concerns of finality, comity, judicial economy, and
channeling the resolution of claims into the most appropriate forum.

Applying the cause-and-prejudice standard in cases like
this will obviously contribute to the finality of convictions,
for requiring a federal evidentiary hearing solely on the basis
of a habeas petitioner's negligent failure to develop facts in

3 Justice O'Connor puts aside our overruling of Fay v. Noia's standard
in procedural default cases on the ground that in those cases the causeand-prejudice standard is just an acceptable precondition to reaching the
merits of a habeas petitioner's claim, but insists that applying that standard to cases in which the petitioner defaulted on the development of a
claim is not subject to the same characterization. For the reasons stated
in the text, we disagree. Moreover, Justice O'Connor's position is considerably weakened by her concession that the cause-and-prejudice standard is properly applied to a factually undeveloped claim which had been
exhausted but which is first asserted federally in a second or later habeas petition.

Contrary to Justice O'Connor's view, post, at 17, we think it clear that
the Townsend Court thought that the same standard used to deny a hearing in a procedural default case should be used to deny a hearing in cases
described in its fifth circumstance. It is difficult to conceive any other
reason for our borrowing the deliberate bypass standard of Fay v. Noia,
particularly if, as the dissent seems to say, post, at 17, Townsend relied
on, but did not repeat, the analysis found in Fay v. Noia. Yet the dissent
insists that the rejection of Fay v. Noia's analysis in our later cases should
have no impact on a case such as we have before us now.

Opinion of the Court
state-court proceedings dramatically increases the opportunities to relitigate a conviction.

Similarly, encouraging the full factual development in
state court of a claim that state courts committed constitutional error advances comity by allowing a coordinate jurisdiction to correct its own errors in the first instance. It reduces the "inevitable friction" that results when a federal
habeas court "overturn[s] either the factual or legal conclusions reached by the state-court system." Sumner v. Mata,
449 U. S. 539, 550 (1981).

Also, by ensuring that full factual development takes
place in the earlier, state-court proceedings, the cause-andprejudice standard plainly serves the interest of judicial
economy. It is hardly a good use of scarce judicial resources
to duplicate factfinding in federal court merely because a
petitioner has negligently failed to take advantage of opportunities in state-court proceedings.

Furthermore, ensuring that full factual development of a
claim takes place in state court channels the resolution of the
claim to the most appropriate forum. The state court is the
appropriate forum for resolution of factual issues in the first
instance, and creating incentives for the deferral of factfinding to later federal-court proceedings can only degrade the
accuracy and efficiency of judicial proceedings. This is fully
consistent with, and gives meaning to, the requirement of
exhaustion. The Court has long held that state prisoners
must exhaust state remedies before obtaining federal habeas
relief. Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241 (1886). The requirement that state prisoners exhaust state remedies before a
writ of habeas corpus is granted by a federal court is now
incorporated in the federal habeas statute.4 28 U. S. C.

4 "An application for a writ of habeas corpus . . . shall not be granted
unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available
in the courts of the State . . . ." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b).

10 KEENEY v. TAMAYO-REYES

Opinion of the Court

$ 2254. Exhaustion means more than notice. In requiringexhaustion of a federal claim in state court, Congress surely

meant that exhaustion be serious and meaningful.The purpose of exhaustion is not to create a procedural
hurdle on the path to federal habeas court, but to channelclaims into an appropriate forum, where meritorious claims
may be vindicated and unfounded litigation obviated beforeresort to federal court. Comity concerns dictate that the
requirement of exhaustion is not satisfied by the mere state-ment of a federal claim in state court. Just as the State
must afford the petitioner a full and fair hearing on his fed-eral claim, so must the petitioner afford the State a full and
fair opportunity to address and resolve the claim on themerits. Cf. Picard v. Connor, 404 U. S. 270, 275 (1971).

Finally, it is worth noting that applying the cause-and-prejudice standard in this case also advances uniformity in
the law of habeas corpus. There is no good reason to main-tain in one area of habeas law a standard that has been rejected in the area in which it was principally enunciated.And little can be said for holding a habeas petitioner to one
standard for failing to bring a claim in state court and excus-ing the petitioner under another, lower standard for failing
to develop the factual basis of that claim in the same forum.A different rule could mean that a habeas petitioner would
not be excused for negligent failure to object to the introduc-tion of the prosecution's evidence, but nonetheless would be
excused for negligent failure to introduce any evidence of hisown to support a constitutional claim.

5 It is asserted by Justice O'Connor that in adopting 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254(d) Congress assumed the continuing validity of all aspects of Townsend, including the requirement of a hearing in all fifth circumstance cases
absent a deliberate bypass. For several reasons, we disagree. First, it
is evident that $ 2254(d) does not codify Townsend's specifications of when
a hearing is required. Townsend described categories of cases in which
evidentiary hearings would be required. Section 2254(d), however, does
not purport to govern the question of when hearings are required; rather,
it lists exceptions to the normal presumption of correctness of state-court

504us1$66D 04-04-96 19:48:31 PAGES OPINPGT

11Cite as: 504 U. S. 1 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
Respondent Tamayo-Reyes is entitled to an evidentiaryhearing if he can show cause for his failure to develop the

facts in state-court proceedings and actual prejudice result-ing from that failure. We also adopt the narrow exception

findings and deals with the burden of proof where hearings are held. The
two issues are distinct, and the statute indicates no assumption that the
presence or absence of any of the statutory exceptions will determine
whether a hearing is held.

Second, to the extent that it even considered the issue of default, Congress sensibly could have read Townsend as holding that the federal
habeas corpus standard for cases of default under Townsend's fifth circumstance and cases of procedural default should be the same. Third,

$ 2254(d) does not mention or recognize any exception for inexcusable neglect, let alone reflect the specific standard of deliberate bypass. In the
face of this silence, it should not be assumed that if there is to be a judicially created standard for equitable default, it must be no other than the
deliberate bypass standard borrowed by Townsend from a decision that
has since been repudiated.

We agree with Justice O'Connor that under our holding a claim invoking the fifth circumstance of Townsend will be unavailing where the cause
asserted is attorney error. Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478 (1986), and
Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), dictate as much. Such was
the intended effect of those cases, but this does not make that circumstance a dead letter, for cause may be shown for reasons other than attorney error. We noted in Murray, a procedural default case, that objective
factors external to the defense may impede counsel's efforts to comply and
went on to say: "Without attempting an exhaustive catalog of such objective impediments to compliance with a procedural rule, we note that a
showing that the factual or legal basis for a claim was not reasonably
available to counsel, see Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S., at 16, or that `some interference by officials,' Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 486 (1953), made compliance impracticable, would constitute cause under this standard." 477
U. S., at 488. Much of the same may be said of cases where the petitioner
has defaulted on the development of a claim.

Nor, to the extent it is relevant to our decision in this case, is Justice
O'Connor's argument that many forms of cause would fall under other
Townsend circumstances persuasive. For example, the third and sixth
circumstances of Townsend speak to the denial by a court of full and fair
hearing; however, a situation where facts were inadequately developed
because of interference from officials would fall naturally into the fifth
circumstance.

O'Connor, J., dissenting
to the cause-and-prejudice requirement: A habeas petition-er's failure to develop a claim in state-court proceedings will

be excused and a hearing mandated if he can show that afundamental miscarriage of justice would result from failure
to hold a federal evidentiary hearing. Cf. McCleskey v.
Zant, 499 U. S., at 494; Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S., at 496.The State concedes that a remand to the District Court is

appropriate in order to afford respondent the opportunity tobring forward evidence establishing cause and prejudice,
Brief for Petitioner 21, and we agree that respondent shouldhave that opportunity. Accordingly, the decision of the
Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded tothe District Court for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

So ordered.

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Blackmun,
Justice Stevens, and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.

Under the guise of overruling "a remnant of a decision,"
ante, at 8, and achieving "uniformity in the law," ante, at 10,the Court has changed the law of habeas corpus in a fundamental way by effectively overruling cases decided long be-fore Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293 (1963). I do not think
this change is supported by the line of our recent proceduraldefault cases upon which the Court relies: In my view, the

manslaughter without any understanding of what "man-slaughter" means. App. 58. If this assertion is true, his

conviction was unconstitutionally obtained, see Henderson v.
Morgan, 426 U. S. 637, 644-647 (1976), and Tamayo-Reyes
would be entitled to a writ of habeas corpus. Despite the
Court's attempt to characterize his allegation as a technicalquibble--"his translator had not translated accurately and

completely for him the mens rea element of manslaughter,"
ante, at 3--this much is not in dispute. Tamayo-Reyes has
alleged a fact that, if true, would entitle him to the reliefhe seeks.

Tamayo-Reyes initially, and properly, challenged the voluntariness of his plea in a petition for postconviction relief
in state court. The court held a hearing, after which it
found that "[p]etitioner's plea of guilty was knowingly and
voluntarily entered." App. 51. Yet the record of the postconviction hearing hardly inspires confidence in the accuracy
of this determination. Tamayo-Reyes was the only witness
to testify, but his attorney did not ask him whether his interpreter had translated "manslaughter" for him. Counsel instead introduced the deposition testimony of the interpreter,
who admitted that he had translated "manslaughter" only
as "less than murder." Id., at 27. No witnesses capable of
assessing the interpreter's performance were called; the attorney instead tried to direct the court's attention to various
sections of the interpreter's deposition and attempted to
point out where the interpreter had erred. When the prosecutor objected to this discussion on the ground that counsel
was not qualified as an expert witness, his "presentation of
the issue quickly disintegrated." 926 F. 2d 1492, 1499 (CA9
1991). The state court had no other relevant evidence before it when it determined that Tamayo-Reyes actually understood the charge to which he was pleading.

Contrary to the impression conveyed by this Court's opinion, the question whether a federal court should defer to this
sort of dubious "factfinding" in addressing a habeas corpus

petition is one with a long history behind it, a history thatdid not begin with Townsend v. Sain.

II

A

The availability and scope of habeas corpus have changedover the writ's long history, but one thing has remained constant: Habeas corpus is not an appellate proceeding, butrather an original civil action in a federal court. See,

e. g.,
Browder v. Director, Dept. of Corrections of Ill., 434 U. S.257, 269 (1978). It was settled over a hundred years ago

that "[t]he prosecution against [a criminal defendant] is acriminal prosecution, but the writ of habeas corpus . . . is not
a proceeding in that prosecution. On the contrary, it is anew suit brought by him to enforce a civil right." Ex parte
Tom Tong, 108 U. S. 556, 559-560 (1883). Any possibledoubt about this point has been removed by the statutory
procedure Congress has provided for the disposition of ha-beas corpus petitions, a procedure including such nonappellate functions as the allegation of facts, 28 U. S. C. $ 2242, thetaking of depositions and the propounding of interrogatories,

$ 2246, the introduction of documentary evidence, $ 2247, and,of course, the determination of facts at evidentiary hearings, $ 2254(d).To be sure, habeas corpus has its own peculiar set of
hurdles a petitioner must clear before his claim is properlypresented to the district court. The petitioner must, in general, exhaust available state remedies, $ 2254(b), avoid proce-dural default, Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991),
not abuse the writ, McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991),and not seek retroactive application of a new rule of law,
Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989). For much of our his-tory, the hurdles were even higher. See,

e. g., Ex parte Wat-kins, 3 Pet. 193, 203 (1830) (habeas corpus available only to

challenge jurisdiction of trial court). But once they havebeen surmounted--once the claim is properly before the dis504us1$66D 04-04-96 19:48:31 PAGES OPINPGT

O'Connor, J., dissenting
trict court--a habeas petitioner, like any civil litigant, hashad a right to a hearing where one is necessary to prove the

facts supporting his claim. See, e. g., Hawk v. Olson, 326U. S. 271, 278-279 (1945);

Holiday v. Johnston, 313 U. S. 342,
351-354 (1941); Walker v. Johnston, 312 U. S. 275, 285-287
(1941); Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U. S. 86, 92 (1923). Thuswhen we observed in

Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S., at 312,
that "the opportunity for redress . . . presupposes the oppor-tunity to be heard, to argue and present evidence," we were

saying nothing new. We were merely restating what hadlong been our understanding of the method by which contested factual issues raised on habeas should be resolved.

Habeas corpus has always differed from ordinary civil litigation, however, in one important respect: The doctrine of
res judicata has never been thought to apply. See, e. g.,
Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 458 (1953); Darr v. Burford,
339 U. S. 200, 214 (1950); Waley v. Johnston, 316 U. S. 101,
105 (1942); Salinger v. Loisel, 265 U. S. 224, 230 (1924). A
state prisoner is not precluded from raising a federal claim
on habeas that has already been rejected by the state courts.
This is not to say that state court factfinding is entitled to
no weight, or that every state prisoner has the opportunity
to relitigate facts found against him by the state courts.
Concerns of federalism and comity have pushed us from this
extreme just as the importance of the writ has repelled us
from the opposite extreme, represented by the strict application of res judicata. Instead, we have consistently occupied
the middle ground. Even before Townsend, federal courts
deferred to state court findings of fact where the federal
district judge was satisfied that the state court had fairly
considered the issues and the evidence and had reached a
satisfactory result. See, e. g., Brown, supra, at 458, 465;
Frank v. Mangum, 237 U. S. 309, 332-336 (1915). But
where such was not the case, the federal court entertaining
the habeas petition would examine the facts anew. See, e. g.,
Ex parte Hawk, 321 U. S. 114, 116, 118 (1944); Moore, supra,

504us1$66D 04-04-96 19:48:31 PAGES OPINPGT
16 KEENEY v. TAMAYO-REYES

O'Connor, J., dissenting
at 92. In Hawk, for example, we stated that a state prisonerwould be entitled to a hearing, 321 U. S., at 116, "where resort to state court remedies has failed to afford a full andfair adjudication of the federal contentions raised . . . because
in the particular case the remedy afforded by state law
proves in practice unavailable or seriously inadequate." Id.,at 118. In

Brown, we explained that a hearing may be dispensed with only "[w]here the record of the application af-fords an adequate opportunity to weigh the sufficiency of the

allegations and the evidence, and no unusual circumstancescalling for a hearing are presented." 344 U. S., at 463.

Townsend "did not launch the Court in any new direc-tions," Weisselberg, Evidentiary Hearings in Federal Habeas
Corpus Cases, 1990 B. Y. U. L. Rev. 131, 150, but it clarified
how the district court should measure the adequacy of thestate court proceeding.

Townsend specified six circumstances in which one could not be confident that "the state-court trier of fact has after a full hearing reliably found the

relevant facts." 372 U. S., at 313. The Court held that ahabeas petitioner is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his
factual allegations if

"(1) the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved
in the state hearing; (2) the state factual determinationis not fairly supported by the record as a whole; (3) the

fact-finding procedure employed by the state court wasnot adequate to afford a full and fair hearing; (4) there
is a substantial allegation of newly discovered evidence;
(5) the material facts were not adequately developed atthe state-court hearing; or (6) for any reason it appears

that the state trier of fact did not afford the habeas
applicant a full and fair fact hearing." Ibid.

That these principles marked no significant departure from
our prior understanding of the writ is evident from the view
expressed by the four dissenters, who had "no quarrel with
the Court's statement of the basic governing principle which

504us1$66D 04-04-96 19:48:31 PAGES OPINPGT

17Cite as: 504 U. S. 1 (1992)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
should determine whether a hearing is to be had in a federalhabeas corpus proceeding," but disagreed only with the

Court's attempt "to erect detailed hearing standards for themyriad situations presented by federal habeas corpus applications." Id., at 326-327 (Stewart, J., dissenting). Townsend thus did not alter the federal courts' practice of holdingan evidentiary hearing unless the state court had fairly considered the relevant evidence.The Court expressed concern in

Townsend that a petitioner might abuse the fifth circumstance described in theopinion, by deliberately withholding evidence from the state

factfinder in the hope of finding a more receptive forum in a
federal court. Id., at 317. To discourage this sort of disrespect for state proceedings, the Court held that such a petitioner would not be entitled to a hearing. Ibid. The Townsend opinion did not need to address this concern in much
detail, because a similar issue was discussed at greater
length in another case decided the same day, Fay v. Noia,
372 U. S. 391, 438-440 (1963). The Townsend opinion thus
merely referred the reader to the discussion in Fay, where
a similar exception was held to bar a state prisoner from
habeas relief where the prisoner had intentionally committed
a procedural default in state court. See Townsend, supra,
at 317.

Nearly 30 years later, the Court implies that Fay and
Townsend must stand or fall together. Ante, at 5-8. But
this is not so: The Townsend Court did not suggest that the
issues in Townsend and Fay were identical, or that they
were so similar that logic required an identical answer to
each. Townsend did not purport to rely on Fay as authority; it merely referred to Fay's discussion as a shorthand device to avoid repeating similar analysis. Indeed, reliance on
Fay as authority would have been unnecessary. Townsend
was essentially an elaboration of our prior cases regarding
the holding of hearings in federal habeas cases; Fay represented an overruling of our prior cases regarding procedural

18 KEENEY v. TAMAYO-REYES

O'Connor, J., dissenting
defaults. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S., at 744-747;
Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 82 (1977).

As the Court recognizes, ante, at 6, we have applied Townsend's analysis ever since. See, e. g., Vasquez v. Hillery, 474
U. S. 254, 258 (1986); Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U. S. 335, 341-
342 (1980); Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 318 (1979); LaVallee v. Delle Rose, 410 U. S. 690, 693-694 (1973); Boyd v.
Dutton, 405 U. S. 1, 3 (1972); Procunier v. Atchley, 400 U. S.446, 451 (1971). But we have not, in my view, been unjustifiably clinging to a poorly reasoned precedent. While weproperly abandoned

Fay because it was inconsistent with
prior cases that represented a better-reasoned balance of
state and federal interests, the same cannot be said of
Townsend.

The Court today holds that even when the reliability of
state factfinding is doubtful because crucial evidence was not
presented to the state trier of fact, a habeas petitioner is
ordinarily not entitled to an opportunity to prove the facts
necessary to his claim. This holding, of course, directly
overrules a portion of Townsend, but more than that, I think
it departs significantly from the pre-Townsend law of habeas
corpus. Even before Townsend, when a habeas petitioner's
claim was properly before a federal court, and when the accurate resolution of that claim depended on proof of facts
that had been resolved against the petitioner in an unreliable
state proceeding, the petitioner was entitled to his day in
federal court. As Justice Holmes wrote for the Court, in a
case where the state courts had rejected--under somewhat
suspicious circumstances--the petitioner's allegation that his
trial had been dominated by an angry mob: "[I]t does not
seem to us sufficient to allow a Judge of the United States
to escape the duty of examining the facts for himself when
if true as alleged they make the trial absolutely void."
Moore, 261 U. S., at 92. The class of petitioners eligible to
present claims on habeas may have been narrower in days
gone by, and the class of claims one might present may have

been smaller, but once the claim was properly before thecourt, the right to a hearing was not construed as narrowly

as the Court construes it today.

B
Instead of looking to the history of the right to an eviden-tiary hearing, the Court simply borrows the cause and prejudice standard from a series of our recent habeas corpuscases.

Ante, at 5-8. All but one of these cases address thequestion of when a habeas claim is properly before a federal

court despite the petitioner's procedural default. See Coleman v. Thompson, supra; Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478(1986); Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1 (1984); Engle v. Isaac, 456

U. S. 107 (1982); Wainwright v. Sykes, supra; Francis v. Hen-derson, 425 U. S. 536 (1976). The remaining case addresses
the issue of a petitioner's abuse of the writ. See McCleskeyv.

Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991). These cases all concern thequestion whether the federal court will consider the merits

of the claim, that is, whether the court has the authority toupset a judgment affirmed on direct appeal. So far as this
threshold inquiry is concerned, our respect for state proce-dural rules and the need to discourage abuse of the writ provide the justification for the cause and prejudice standard.As we have said in the former context: "[T]he Great Writ
imposes special costs on our federal system. The Statespossess primary authority for defining and enforcing the
criminal law. In criminal trials they also hold the initialresponsibility for vindicating constitutional rights. Federal
intrusions into state criminal trials frustrate both the States'sovereign power to punish offenders and their good-faith
attempts to honor constitutional rights." Engle, supra, at128.

The question we are considering here is quite different.Here, the Federal District Court has already determined
that it will consider the claimed constitutional violation; theonly question is how the court will go about it. When it

504us1$66D 04-04-96 19:48:31 PAGES OPINPGT
20 KEENEY v. TAMAYO-REYES

O'Connor, J., dissenting
comes to determining whether a hearing is to be held to re-solve a claim that is already properly before a federal court,

the federalism concerns underlying our procedural defaultcases are diminished somewhat. By this point, our concern
is less with encroaching on the territory of the state courtsthan it is with managing the territory of the federal courts
in a manner that will best implement their responsibility toconsider habeas petitions. Our adoption of a cause and prejudice standard to resolve the first concern should not causeus reflexively to adopt the same standard to resolve the second. Federalism, comity, and finality are all advanced bydeclining to permit relitigation of claims in federal court in
certain circumstances; these interests are less significantlyadvanced, once relitigation properly occurs, by permitting
district courts to resolve claims based on an incompleterecord.

III
The Court's decision today cannot be reconciled with sub-section (d) of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254, which Congress enacted only

three years after we decided Townsend. Subsection (d) pro-vides that state court factfinding "shall be presumed to be
correct, unless the applicant shall establish" one of eightlisted circumstances. Most of these circumstances are taken
word for word from Townsend, including the one at issuehere; $ 2254(d)(3) renders the presumption of correctness
inapplicable where "the material facts were not adequatelydeveloped at the State court hearing." The effect of the
presumption is to augment the habeas petitioner's burdenof proof. Where state factfinding is presumed correct, the
petitioner must establish the state court's error "by convinc-ing evidence"; where state factfinding is not presumed
correct, the petitioner must prove the facts necessary tosupport his claim by only a preponderance of the evidence.
Sumner v. Mata, 449 U. S. 539, 551 (1981).Section 2254(d) is not, in the strict sense, a codification of
our holding in Townsend. The listed circumstances in

504us1$66D 04-04-96 19:48:31 PAGES OPINPGT

21Cite as: 504 U. S. 1 (1992)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
Townsend are those in which a hearing must be held; thenearly identical listed circumstances in $ 2254(d) are those in

which facts found by a state court are not presumed correct.But the two are obviously intertwined. If a habeas petitioner fulfills one of the Townsend requirements he will be
entitled to a hearing, and by virtue of fulfilling a Townsendrequirement he will necessarily have also fulfilled one of the

$ 2254(d) requirements, so that at his hearing the presump-tion of correctness will not apply. On the other hand, if
the petitioner has not fulfilled one of the Townsend require-ments he will generally not have fulfilled the corresponding

$ 2254(d) requirement either, so he will be entitled neither
to a hearing nor to an exception from the presumption of
correctness. Townsend and $ 2254(d) work hand in hand:
Where a petitioner has a right to a hearing he must prove
facts by a preponderance of the evidence, but where he has
no right to a hearing he must prove facts by the higher
standard of convincing evidence. Without the opportunity
for a hearing, it is safe to assume that this higher standard
will be unattainable for most petitioners. See L. Yackle,
Postconviction Remedies 508-509 (1981).

In enacting a statute that so closely parallels Townsend,
Congress established a procedural framework that relies
upon Townsend's continuing validity. In general, therefore,
overruling Townsend would frustrate the evident intent of
Congress that the question of when a hearing is to be held
should be governed by the same standards as the question
of when a federal court should defer to state court factfinding. In particular, the Court's adoption of a "cause and prejudice" standard for determining whether the material facts
were adequately developed in state proceedings will frustrate Congress' intent with respect to that Townsend circumstance's statutory analog, $ 2254(d)(3).

For a case to fit within this Townsend circumstance but
none of Townsend's other circumstances, the case will very
likely be like this one, where the material facts were not

504us1$66D 04-04-96 19:48:31 PAGES OPINPGT
22 KEENEY v. TAMAYO-REYES

O'Connor, J., dissenting
developed because of attorney error. Any other reason thematerial facts might not have been developed, such as that

they were unknown at the time or that the State denied afull and fair opportunity to develop them, will almost certainly be covered by one of Townsend's other circumstances.
See Townsend, 372 U. S., at 313. We have already held thatattorney error short of constitutionally ineffective assistance

of counsel does not amount to "cause." See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S., at 488. As a result, the practical effect of
the Court's ruling today will be that for a case to fall within
Townsend's fifth circumstance but no other--for a petitioner
to be entitled to a hearing on the ground that the material
facts were not adequately developed in state court but on no
other ground--the petitioner's attorney must have rendered
constitutionally ineffective assistance in presenting facts to
the state factfinder.

This effect is more than a little ironic. Where the state
factfinding occurs at the trial itself, counsel's ineffectiveness
will not just entitle the petitioner to a hearing--it will entitle
the petitioner to a new trial. Where, as in this case, the
state factfinding occurs at a postconviction proceeding, the
petitioner has no constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel, so counsel's poor performance can never
constitute "cause" under the cause and prejudice standard.
Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S., at 752. After today's decision, the only petitioners entitled to a hearing under Townsend's fifth circumstance are the very people who do not need
one, because they will have already obtained a new trial or
because they will already be entitled to a hearing under one
of the other circumstances. The Court has thus rendered
unusable the portion of Townsend requiring hearings where
the material facts were not adequately developed in state
court.

As noted above, the fact that $ 2254(d)(3) uses language
identical to the language we used in Townsend strongly suggests that Congress presumed the continued existence of this

23Cite as: 504 U. S. 1 (1992)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
portion of Townsend. Moreover, the Court's application of
a cause and prejudice standard creates a conundrum regarding how to interpret $ 2254(d)(3). If a cause and prejudice
standard applies to $ 2254(d)(3) as well as Townsend's fifth
circumstance, then the Court has rendered $ 2254(d)(3) superfluous for the same reason this part of Townsend has become superfluous. While we may deprive portions of our
own prior decisions of any effect, we generally may not, of
course, do the same with portions of statutes. On the other
hand, if a cause and prejudice standard does not apply to

$ 2254(d)(3), we will have uncoupled the statute from the case
it was intended to follow, and there will likely be instances
where a petitioner will be entitled to an exception from the
presumption of correctness but will not be entitled to a hearing. This result does not accord with the evident intent of
Congress that the first inquiry track the second. Reconciliation of these two questions is now left to the district courts,
who still possess the discretion, which has not been removed
by today's opinion, to hold hearings even where they are not
mandatory. See Townsend, supra, at 318.

For these reasons, I think $ 2254(d) presumes the continuing validity of our decision in Townsend, including the
portion of the decision that recognized a "deliberate bypass"
exception to a petitioner's right to a hearing where the material facts were not adequately developed in the state court.

Jose Tamayo-Reyes alleges that he pleaded nolo contendere to a crime he did not understand. He has exhausted
state remedies, has committed no procedural default, has
properly presented his claim to a Federal District Court in
his first petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and would be
entitled to a hearing under the standard set forth in Townsend. Given that his claim is properly before the District
Court, I would not cut off his right to prove his claim at a
hearing. I respectfully dissent.

Kennedy, J., dissenting
Justice Kennedy, dissenting.
By definition, the cases within the ambit of the Court'sholding are confined to those in which the factual record developed in the state-court proceedings is inadequate to re-solve the legal question. I should think those cases will be
few in number. Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 318 (1963),has been the law for almost 30 years and there is no clear
evidence that this particular classification of habeas proceed-ings has burdened the dockets of the federal courts. And in
my view, the concept of factual inadequacy comprehends onlythose petitions with respect to which there is a realistic possibility that an evidentiary hearing will make a difference inthe outcome. This serves to narrow the number of cases in
a further respect and to ensure that they are the ones, as
Justice O'Connor points out, in which we have valid con-cerns with constitutional error.

Our recent decisions in Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S.722 (1991), McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991), and
Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), serve to protect theintegrity of the writ, curbing its abuse and ensuring that the
legal questions presented are ones which, if resolved againstthe State, can invalidate a final judgment. So we consider
today only those habeas actions which present questions fed-eral courts are bound to decide in order to protect constitutional rights. We ought not to take steps which diminishthe likelihood that those courts will base their legal decision
on an accurate assessment of the facts. For these reasonsand all those set forth by

Justice O'Connor, I dissent fromthe opinion and judgment of the Court.

25OCTOBER TERM, 1991
Syllabus

DENTON, DIRECTOR OF CORRECTIONS OF CALI-FORNIA,

et al. v. HERNANDEZ

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 90-1846. Argued February 24, 1992--Decided May 4, 1992
Respondent Hernandez, a prisoner proceeding pro se, filed five civil rights

suits in forma pauperis against petitioner California prison officials,
alleging, inter alia, that he was drugged and homosexually raped 28
times by various inmates and prison officials at different institutions.
Finding that the facts alleged appeared to be wholly fanciful, the District Court dismissed the cases under 28 U. S. C. $ 1915(d), which allows
courts to dismiss an in forma pauperis complaint "if satisfied that the
action is frivolous." Reviewing the dismissals de novo, the Court of
Appeals reversed and remanded three of the cases. The court's lead
opinion concluded that a court can dismiss a complaint as factually frivolous only if the allegations conflict with judicially noticeable facts and
that it was impossible to take judicial notice that none of the alleged
rapes occurred; the concurring opinion concluded that Circuit precedent
required that Hernandez be given notice that his claims were to be dismissed as frivolous and a chance to amend his complaints. The Court
of Appeals adhered to these positions on remand from this Court for
consideration of the Court's intervening decision in Neitzke v. Williams,
490 U. S. 319, which held that an in forma pauperis complaint "is frivolous [under $ 1915(d)] where it lacks an arguable basis either in law or
in fact," id., at 325.

Held:

1. The Court of Appeals incorrectly limited the power granted the
courts to dismiss a frivolous case under $ 1915(d). Section 1915(d) gives
the courts "the unusual power to pierce the veil of the complaint's factual allegations and dismiss those claims whose factual contentions are
clearly baseless." Id., at 327. Thus, the court is not bound, as it usually is when making a determination based solely on the pleadings, to
accept without question the truth of the plaintiff's allegations. However, in order to respect the congressional goal of assuring equality of
consideration for all litigants, the initial assessment of the in forma
pauperis plaintiff's factual allegations must be weighted in the plaintiff's favor. A factual frivolousness finding is appropriate when the
facts alleged rise to the level of the irrational or the wholly incredible,

504us1$67z 04-04-96 19:55:19 PAGES OPINPGT
26 DENTON v. HERNANDEZ

Syllabus
whether or not there are judicially noticeable facts available to contradict them, but a complaint cannot be dismissed simply because the court
finds the allegations to be improbable or unlikely. The "clearly baseless" guidepost need not be defined with more precision, since the district courts are in the best position to determine which cases fall into
this category, and since the statute's instruction allowing dismissal if
a court is "satisfied" that the complaint is frivolous indicates that the
frivolousness decision is entrusted to the discretion of the court entertaining the complaint. Pp. 31-33.

2. Because the frivolousness determination is a discretionary one, a

$ 1915(d) dismissal is properly reviewed for an abuse of that discretion.
It would be appropriate for a court of appeals to consider, among other
things, whether the plaintiff was proceeding pro se, whether the district
court inappropriately resolved genuine issues of disputed fact, whether
the court applied erroneous legal conclusions, whether the court has
provided a statement explaining the dismissal that facilitates intelligent
appellate review, and whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice. With respect to the last factor, the reviewing court should determine whether the district court abused its discretion by dismissing the
complaint with prejudice or without leave to amend if it appears that
the allegations could be remedied through more specific pleading, since
dismissal under $ 1915(d) could have a res judicata effect on frivolousness determinations for future in forma pauperis petitions. This
Court expresses no opinion on the Court of Appeals' rule that a pro se

Richard W. Nichols, by appointment of the Court, 502
U. S. 966, argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.*

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
The federal in forma pauperis statute, codified at 28
U. S. C. $ 1915, allows an indigent litigant to commence a civil
or criminal action in federal court without paying the administrative costs of proceeding with the lawsuit. The statute
protects against abuses of this privilege by allowing a district court to dismiss the case "if the allegation of poverty
is untrue, or if satisfied that the action is frivolous or malicious." $ 1915(d). In Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U. S. 319
(1989), we considered the standard to be applied when determining whether the legal basis of an in forma pauperis
complaint is frivolous under $ 1915(d). The issues in this
case are the appropriate inquiry for determining when an
in forma pauperis litigant's factual allegations justify a

$ 1915(d) dismissal for frivolousness, and the proper standard
of appellate review of such a dismissal.

officials at different institutions.* With few exceptions, thealleged perpetrators are not identified in the complaints, because Hernandez does not claim any direct recollection of theincidents. Rather, he asserts that he found needle marks on
different parts of his body, and fecal and semen stains on hisclothes, which led him to believe that he had been drugged
and raped while he slept.Hernandez's allegations that he was sexually assaulted on
the nights of January 13, 1984, and January 27, 1984, aresupported by an affidavit signed by fellow prisoner Armando
Esquer (Esquer Affidavit), which states:

"On January 13, 1984, at approximately 7:30 a.m., Iwas on my way to the shower, when I saw correctional

officer McIntyre, the P-2 Unit Officer, unlock inmateMike Hernandez's cell door and subsequently saw as two
black inmates stepped inside his cell. I did not see Officer McIntyre order these two black inmates out of in-mate Mike Hernandez's cell after they stepped inside,

even though inmate Mike Hernandez was asleep inside.After about ten minutes, I returned from the shower,
and I noticed my friend, Mike Hernandez, was being sex-ually assaulted by the two black inmates. Officer McIn*See Amended Complaint in Hernandez v. Ylst, et al., No. CIV S-83-

they and Officer McIntyre were up to no good. Afterthis last incident, I became convinced that Officer McIntyre was deliberately unlocking my friend, Mike Her-nandez's cell as he [lay] asleep, so that these two black

Hernandez also attempted to amend one complaint to includean affidavit signed by fellow inmate Harold Pierce, alleging
that on the night of July 29, 1983, he "witnessed inmate Du-shane B-71187 and inmate Milliard B-30802 assault and rape
inmate Mike Hernandez as he lay . . . asleep in bed 206 inthe N-2 Unit Dorm." See Exhibit G to Motion to Amend

The District Court determined that the five cases wererelated and referred them to a Magistrate, who recommended that the complaints be dismissed as frivolous. TheMagistrate reasoned that " `each complaint, taken separately,
is not necessarily frivolous,' " but that " `a different pictureemerges from a reading of all five complaints together.' "
Id., at 11. As he explained: " `[Hernandez] alleges that bothguards and inmates, at different institutions, subjected him
to sexual assaults. Despite the fact that different defend-ants are allegedly responsible for each assault, the purported
modus operandi is identical in every case. Moreover, theattacks occurred only sporadically throughout a three year
period. The facts thus appear to be "wholly fanciful" andjustify this court's dismissal of the actions as frivolous.' "

Opinion of the Court
Ibid. By order dated May 5, 1986, the District Courtadopted the recommendation of the Magistrate and dismissed the complaints.Hernandez appealed the dismissal of three of the five cases
(Nos. CIV S-83-0645, CIV S-83-1348, CIV S-85-0084; see
n. 1, supra). Reviewing the dismissal de novo, the Court ofAppeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded.

Hernandez v. Denton, 861 F. 2d 1421 (1988). In relevant part,Judge Schroeder's lead opinion concluded that a district

court could dismiss a complaint as factually frivolous only ifthe allegations conflicted with judicially noticeable facts, that
is, facts " `capable of accurate and ready determination by
resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.' " Id., at 1426 (quoting Fed. Rule Evid. 201). In
this case, Judge Schroeder wrote, the court could not dismiss
Hernandez's claims as frivolous because it was impossible to
take judicial notice that none of the alleged rapes occurred.
861 F. 2d, at 1426. Judge Wallace concurred on the ground
that Circuit precedent required that Hernandez be given notice that his claims were to be dismissed as frivolous and a
chance to amend his complaints to remedy the deficiencies.
Id., at 1427. Judge Aldisert dissented. He was of the opinion that the allegations were "the hallucinations of a troubled
man," id., at 1440, and that no further amendment could save
the complaint, id., at 1439-1440.

We granted petitioners' first petition for a writ of certiorari, 493 U. S. 801 (1989), vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for consideration
of our intervening decision in Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U. S.
319 (1989). On remand, the Court of Appeals reaffirmed its
earlier decision. 929 F. 2d 1374 (1991). Judge Schroeder
modified her original opinion to state that judicial notice was
just "one useful standard" for determining factual frivolousness under $ 1915(d), but adhered to her position that the
case could not be dismissed because no judicially noticeable
fact could contradict Hernandez's claims of rape. Id., at

Opinion of the Court
1376. Judge Wallace and Judge Aldisert repeated their ear-lier views.

We granted the second petition for a writ of certiorari toconsider when an in forma pauperis claim may be dismissed
as factually frivolous under $ 1915(d). 502 U. S. 937 (1991).We hold that the Court of Appeals incorrectly limited the
power granted the courts to dismiss a frivolous case under$ 1915(d), and therefore vacate and remand the case for application of the proper standard.

II
In enacting the federal in forma pauperis statute, Con-gress "intended to guarantee that no citizen shall be denied

an opportunity to commence, prosecute, or defend an action,civil or criminal, in any court of the United States, solely
because . . . poverty makes it impossible . . . to pay or securethe costs" of litigation.

Adkins v. E. I. DuPont de Nem-ours & Co., 335 U. S. 331, 342 (1948) (internal quotation

marks omitted). At the same time that it sought to lowerjudicial access barriers to the indigent, however, Congress
recognized that "a litigant whose filing fees and court costsare assumed by the public, unlike a paying litigant, lacks
an economic incentive to refrain from filing frivolous, mali-cious, or repetitive lawsuits."

Neitzke, supra, at 324. Inresponse to this concern, Congress included subsection (d) as

part of the statute, which allows the courts to dismiss anin forma pauperis complaint "if satisfied that the action is
frivolous or malicious."Neitzke v. Williams, supra, provided us with our first occasion to construe the meaning of "frivolous" under $ 1915(d).In that case, we held that "a complaint, containing as it does
both factual allegations and legal conclusions, is frivolouswhere it lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact."
Id., at 325. In Neitzke, we were concerned with the properstandard for determining frivolousness of legal conclusions,
and we determined that a complaint filed in forma pauperis

504us1$67z 04-04-96 19:55:19 PAGES OPINPGT
32 DENTON v. HERNANDEZ

Opinion of the Court
which fails to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Pro-cedure 12(b)(6) may nonetheless have "an arguable basis in

law" precluding dismissal under $ 1915(d). 490 U. S., at 328-329. In so holding, we observed that the

in forma pauperis
statute, unlike Rule 12(b)(6), "accords judges not only the
authority to dismiss a claim based on an indisputably merit-less legal theory, but also the unusual power to pierce the

veil of the complaint's factual allegations and dismiss thoseclaims whose factual contentions are clearly baseless."

Id.,
at 327. "Examples of the latter class," we said, "are claimsdescribing fantastic or delusional scenarios, claims with

which federal district judges are all too familiar." Id., at
328.

Petitioners contend that the decision below is inconsistent with the "unusual" dismissal power we recognized in
Neitzke, and we agree. Contrary to the Ninth Circuit's
assumption, our statement in Neitzke that $ 1915(d) gives
courts the authority to "pierce the veil of the complaint's
factual allegations" means that a court is not bound, as it
usually is when making a determination based solely on the
pleadings, to accept without question the truth of the plaintiff 's allegations. We therefore reject the notion that a
court must accept as "having an arguable basis in fact," id.,
at 325, all allegations that cannot be rebutted by judicially
noticeable facts. At the same time, in order to respect the
congressional goal of "assur[ing] equality of consideration for
all litigants," Coppedge v. United States, 369 U. S. 438, 447
(1962), this initial assessment of the in forma pauperis plaintiff 's factual allegations must be weighted in favor of the
plaintiff. In other words, the $ 1915(d) frivolousness determination, frequently made sua sponte before the defendant
has even been asked to file an answer, cannot serve as a
factfinding process for the resolution of disputed facts.

As we stated in Neitzke, a court may dismiss a claim as
factually frivolous only if the facts alleged are "clearly baseless," 490 U. S., at 327, a category encompassing allegations

Opinion of the Court
that are "fanciful," id., at 325, "fantastic," id., at 328, and"delusional,"

ibid. As those words suggest, a finding of factual frivolousness is appropriate when the facts alleged riseto the level of the irrational or the wholly incredible, whether

or not there are judicially noticeable facts available to contradict them. An in forma pauperis complaint may notbe dismissed, however, simply because the court finds the

plaintiff 's allegations unlikely. Some improbable allegationsmight properly be disposed of on summary judgment, but to
dismiss them as frivolous without any factual development isto disregard the age-old insight that many allegations might
be "strange, but true; for truth is always strange, Stranger
than fiction." Lord Byron, Don Juan, canto XIV, stanza 101
(T. Steffan, E. Steffan, & W. Pratt eds. 1977).

Although Hernandez urges that we define the "clearly
baseless" guidepost with more precision, we are confident
that the district courts, who are "all too familiar" with factually frivolous claims, Neitzke, supra, at 328, are in the best
position to determine which cases fall into this category. Indeed, the statute's instruction that an action may be dismissed if the court is "satisfied" that it is frivolous indicates
that frivolousness is a decision entrusted to the discretion of
the court entertaining the in forma pauperis petition. We
therefore decline the invitation to reduce the "clearly baseless" inquiry to a monolithic standard.

Because the frivolousness determination is a discretionary
one, we further hold that a $ 1915(d) dismissal is properly
reviewed for an abuse of that discretion, and that it was
error for the Court of Appeals to review the dismissal of
Hernandez's claims de novo. Cf. Boag v. MacDougall, 454
U. S. 364, 365, n. (1982) (per curiam) (reversing dismissal of
an in forma pauperis petition when dismissal was based on
an erroneous legal conclusion and not exercise of the "broad
discretion" granted by $ 1915(d)); Coppedge, supra, at 446
(district court's certification that in forma pauperis appellant is taking appeal in good faith, as required by $ 1915(a),

504us1$67z 04-04-96 19:55:19 PAGES OPINPGT
34 DENTON v. HERNANDEZ

Opinion of the Court
is "entitled to weight"). In reviewing a $ 1915(d) dismissalfor abuse of discretion, it would be appropriate for the Court

of Appeals to consider, among other things, whether theplaintiff was proceeding

pro se, see Haines v. Kerner, 404
U. S. 519, 520-521 (1972); whether the court inappropriately
resolved genuine issues of disputed fact, see supra, at 32-33;whether the court applied erroneous legal conclusions, see

Boag, 454 U. S., at 365, n.; whether the court has provided astatement explaining the dismissal that facilitates "intelligent appellate review," ibid.; and whether the dismissal waswith or without prejudice.

With respect to this last factor: Because a $ 1915(d) dismissal is not a dismissal on the merits, but rather an exercise
of the court's discretion under the in forma pauperis statute,
the dismissal does not prejudice the filing of a paid complaint
making the same allegations. It could, however, have a res
judicata effect on frivolousness determinations for future in
forma pauperis petitions. See, e. g., Bryant v. Civiletti, 214
U. S. App. D. C. 109, 110-111, 663 F. 2d 286, 287-288, n. 1
(1981) ($ 1915(d) dismissal for frivolousness is res judicata);
Warren v. McCall, 709 F. 2d 1183, 1186, and n. 7 (CA7 1983)
(same); cf. Rogers v. Bruntrager, 841 F. 2d 853, 855 (CA8
1988) (noting that application of res judicata principles
after $ 1915(d) dismissal can be "somewhat problematical").
Therefore, if it appears that frivolous factual allegations
could be remedied through more specific pleading, a court
of appeals reviewing a $ 1915(d) disposition should consider
whether the district court abused its discretion by dismissing
the complaint with prejudice or without leave to amend.
Because it is not properly before us, we express no opinion
on the Ninth Circuit rule, applied below, that a pro se litigant
bringing suit in forma pauperis is entitled to notice and an
opportunity to amend the complaint to overcome any deficiency unless it is clear that no amendment can cure the defect. E. g., Potter v. McCall, 433 F. 2d 1087, 1088 (1970);
Noll v. Carlson, 809 F. 2d 1446 (1987).

Accordingly, we vacate the judgment below and remandthe case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

My disagreement with the Court is narrow. I agree withits articulation of the standard to be applied in determining
whether an in forma pauperis complaint is frivolous under28 U. S. C. $ 1915(d). Moreover, precedent supports the
Court's decision to remand the case without expressing anyview on the proper application of that standard to the facts
of the case. See, e. g., Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County
Jail, 502 U. S. 367 (1992). Nevertheless, because I am satis-fied that the decision of the Court of Appeals is entirely consistent with the standard announced today, I would affirmits judgment.

UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 90-1972. Argued January 22, 1992--Decided May 4, 1992
Respondent Williams was indicted by a federal grand jury for alleged

violations of 18 U. S. C. $ 1014. On his motion, the District Court ordered the indictment dismissed without prejudice because the Government had failed to fulfill its obligation under Circuit precedent to present "substantial exculpatory evidence" to the grand jury. Following
that precedent, the Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held:

1. The argument that the petition should be dismissed as improvidently granted because the question presented was not raised below
was considered and rejected when this Court granted certiorari and is
rejected again here. The Court will not review a question that was
neither pressed nor passed on below, see, e. g., Stevens v. Department
of Treasury, 500 U. S. 1, 8, but there is no doubt that the Court of
Appeals passed on the crucial issue of the prosecutor's duty to present
exculpatory evidence to the grand jury. It is appropriate to review an
important issue expressly decided by a federal court where, as here,
although the petitioner did not contest the issue in the case immediately
at hand, it did so as a party to the recent proceeding upon which the
lower courts relied for their resolution of the issue, and did not concede
in the current case the correctness of that precedent. Pp. 40-45.

2. A district court may not dismiss an otherwise valid indictment because the Government failed to disclose to the grand jury "substantial
exculpatory evidence" in its possession. Pp. 45-55.

(a) Imposition of the Court of Appeals' disclosure rule is not supported by the courts' inherent "supervisory power" to formulate procedural rules not specifically required by the Constitution or the Congress.
This Court's cases relying upon that power deal strictly with the courts'
control over their own procedures, whereas the grand jury is an institution separate from the courts, over whose functioning the courts do not
preside. Any power federal courts may have to fashion, on their own
initiative, rules of grand jury procedure is very limited and certainly
would not permit the reshaping of the grand jury institution that would
be the consequence of the proposed rule here. Pp. 45-50.

(b) The Court of Appeals' rule would neither preserve nor enhance
the traditional functioning of the grand jury that the "common law" of

Opinion of the Court
the Fifth Amendment demands. To the contrary, requiring the prosecutor to present exculpatory as well as inculpatory evidence would alter
the grand jury's historical role, transforming it from an accusatory body
that sits to assess whether there is adequate basis for bringing a criminal charge into an adjudicatory body that sits to determine guilt or
innocence. Because it has always been thought sufficient for the grand
jury to hear only the prosecutor's side, and, consequently that the suspect has no right to present, and the grand jury no obligation to consider, exculpatory evidence, it would be incompatible with the traditional system to impose upon the prosecutor a legal obligation to present
such evidence. Moreover, motions to quash indictments based upon the
sufficiency of the evidence relied upon by the grand jury have never
been allowed, and it would make little sense to abstain from reviewing
the evidentiary support for the grand jury's judgment while scrutinizing
the sufficiency of the prosecutor's presentation. Pp. 51-55.

(c) This Court need not pursue respondent's argument that the
Court of Appeals' rule would save valuable judicial time. If there is
any advantage to the proposal, Congress is free to prescribe it. P. 55.

38 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMS

Opinion of the Court
Government failed to disclose to the grand jury "substantial
exculpatory evidence" in its possession.

I
On May 4, 1988, respondent John H. Williams, Jr., a Tulsa,
Oklahoma, investor, was indicted by a federal grand jury on
seven counts of "knowingly mak[ing] [a] false statement or
report . . . for the purpose of influencing . . . the action [of a
federally insured financial institution]," in violation of 18
U. S. C. $ 1014 (1988 ed., Supp. II). According to the indictment, between September 1984 and November 1985 Williams
supplied four Oklahoma banks with "materially false" statements that variously overstated the value of his current
assets and interest income in order to influence the banks'
actions on his loan requests.

Williams' misrepresentation was allegedly effected
through two financial statements provided to the banks, a
"Market Value Balance Sheet" and a "Statement of Projected
Income and Expense." The former included as "current
assets" approximately $6 million in notes receivable from
three venture capital companies. Though it contained a disclaimer that these assets were carried at cost rather than at
market value, the Government asserted that listing them as
"current assets"--i. e., assets quickly reducible to cash--was
misleading, since Williams knew that none of the venture
capital companies could afford to satisfy the notes in the
short term. The second document--the Statement of Projected Income and Expense--allegedly misrepresented Williams' interest income, since it failed to reflect that the interest payments received on the notes of the venture capital
companies were funded entirely by Williams' own loans to
those companies. The Statement thus falsely implied, according to the Government, that Williams was deriving interest income from "an independent outside source." Brief

Opinion of the Court
Shortly after arraignment, the District Court granted Wil-liams' motion for disclosure of all exculpatory portions of the

grand jury transcripts. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S.83 (1963). Upon reviewing this material, Williams demanded that the District Court dismiss the indictment, alleging that the Government had failed to fulfill its obligationunder the Tenth Circuit's prior decision in

United States v.
Page, 808 F. 2d 723, 728 (1987), to present "substantial excul-patory evidence" to the grand jury (emphasis omitted). His

contention was that evidence which the Government hadchosen not to present to the grand jury--in particular, Williams' general ledgers and tax returns, and Williams' testimony in his contemporaneous Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding--disclosed that, for tax purposes and otherwise, he
had regularly accounted for the "notes receivable" (and the
interest on them) in a manner consistent with the Balance
Sheet and the Income Statement. This, he contended, belied an intent to mislead the banks, and thus directly negated
an essential element of the charged offense.

The District Court initially denied Williams' motion, but
upon reconsideration ordered the indictment dismissed without prejudice. It found, after a hearing, that the withheld
evidence was "relevant to an essential element of the crime
charged," created " `a reasonable doubt about [respondent's]
guilt,' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a-24a (quoting United States
v. Gray, 502 F. Supp. 150, 152 (DC 1980)), and thus "render[ed] the grand jury's decision to indict gravely suspect,"
App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a. Upon the Government's appeal,
the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's order, following its earlier decision in Page, supra. It first sustained
as not "clearly erroneous" the District Court's determination
that the Government had withheld "substantial exculpatory
evidence" from the grand jury. See 899 F. 2d 898, 900-903
(CA10 1990). It then found that the Government's behavior
" `substantially influence[d]' " the grand jury's decision to indict, or at the very least raised a " `grave doubt that the

decision to indict was free from such substantial influence.' "Id., at 903 (quoting Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States,

487 U. S. 250, 263 (1988)); see 899 F. 2d, at 903-904. Underthese circumstances, the Tenth Circuit concluded, it was not
an abuse of discretion for the District Court to require theGovernment to begin anew before the grand jury.

1 We

granted certiorari. 502 U. S. 905 (1991).

II
Before proceeding to the merits of this matter, it is neces-sary to discuss the propriety of reaching them. Certiorari

was sought and granted in this case on the following ques-tion: "Whether an indictment may be dismissed because the
government failed to present exculpatory evidence to thegrand jury." The first point discussed in respondent's brief
opposing the petition was captioned "The `Question Pre-sented' in the Petition Was Never Raised Below." Brief in
Opposition 3. In granting certiorari, we necessarily consid-ered and rejected that contention as a basis for denying
review.

Justice Stevens' dissent, however, revisits that issue,and proposes that--after briefing, argument, and full consideration of the issue by all the Justices of this Court--wenow decline to entertain this petition for the same reason we
originally rejected, and that we dismiss it as improvidentlygranted. That would be improvident indeed. Our grant of
certiorari was entirely in accord with our traditional prac-tice, though even if it were not it would be imprudent (since
there is no doubt that we have jurisdiction to entertain thecase) to reverse course at this late stage. See, e. g., Ferguson v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 352 U. S. 521, 560(1957) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part);

art, J., concurring, joined by White, J.). Cf. Oklahoma Cityv. Tuttle, 471 U. S. 808, 816 (1985).

Our traditional rule, as the dissent correctly notes, pre-cludes a grant of certiorari only when "the question presented was not pressed or passed upon below." Post, at 58(internal quotation marks omitted). That this rule operates
(as it is phrased) in the disjunctive, permitting review of anissue not pressed so long as it has been passed upon, is illustrated by some of our more recent dispositions. As recentlyas last Term, in fact (in an opinion joined by

Justice Stevens), we entertained review in circumstances far more sug-gestive of the petitioner's "sleeping on its rights" than those

we face today. We responded as follows to the argument ofthe Solicitor General that tracks today's dissent:

"The Solicitor General . . . submits that the petitionfor certiorari should be dismissed as having been improvidently granted. He rests this submission on theargument that petitioner did not properly present the
merits of the timeliness issue to the Court of Appeals,and that this Court should not address that question for
the first time. He made the same argument in his oppo-sition to the petition for certiorari. We rejected that
argument in granting certiorari and we reject it againnow because the Court of Appeals, like the District
Court before it, decided the substantive issue pre-sented."

Stevens v. Department of Treasury, 500 U. S.1, 8 (1991) (

Blackmun, J.) (citations omitted).

And in another case decided last Term, we said the following:

"Respondents argue that this issue was not raisedbelow. The appeals court, however, addressed the

availability of a right of action to minority shareholdersin respondents' circumstances and concluded that respondents were entitled to sue. It suffices for our pur-poses that the court below passed on the issue presented, particularly where the issue is, we believe, in a

omitted).
(Justice Stevens' separate concurrence and dissent in Virginia Bankshares also reached the merits. Id., at 1110-1112.)

2 As Justice O'Connor has written:

"The standard we previously have employed is that wewill not review a question not pressed or passed on by

the courts below. Here, the Court of Appeals expresslyruled on the question, in an appropriate exercise of its

2 The dissent purports to distinguish Stevens and Virginia Bankshares
on the ground that, "[a]lthough the parties may not have raised the questions presented in the petitions . . . before the Courts of Appeals in those
cases, the courts treated the questions as open questions that they needed
to resolve in order to decide the cases." Post, at 58, n. 4. The significance of this distinction completely eludes us. While there is much to be
said for a rule (to which the Court has never adhered) limiting review to
questions pressed by the litigants below, the rule implicitly proposed by
the dissent--under which issues not pressed, but nevertheless passed
upon, may be reviewed only if the court below thought the issue an "open"
one--makes no sense except as a device to distinguish Stevens and Virginia Bankshares. It does nothing to further "the adversary process"
that is the object of the dissent's concern, post, at 59, n. 5; if a question
is not disputed by the parties, "the adversary process" is compromised
whether the court thinks the question open or not. Indeed, if anything,
it is compromised more when the lower court believes it is confronting a
question of first impression, for it is in those circumstances that the need
for an adversary presentation is most acute.

The dissent observes that where a court disposes of a case on the basis
of a "new rule that had not been debated by the parties, our review may
be appropriate to give the losing party an opportunity it would not otherwise have to challenge the rule." Ibid. That is true enough, but the
suggestion that this principle has something to do with Stevens and Virginia Bankshares is wholly unfounded: In neither case could--or did--the
losing party claim to have been ambushed by the lower court's summary
treatment of the undisputed issues which we later subjected to plenary
review.

appellate jurisdiction; it is therefore entirely proper inlight of our precedents for the Court to reach the question on which it granted certiorari . . . ." Springfieldv. Kibbe, 480 U. S. 257, 266 (1987) (dissenting opinion)

(emphasis in original; citations omitted).3
There is no doubt in the present case that the Tenth Cir-cuit decided the crucial issue of the prosecutor's duty to present exculpatory evidence.4 Moreover, this is not, as the dis-sent paints it, a case in which, "[a]fter losing in the Court of
Appeals, the Government reversed its position," post, at 57.

3 The Court's per curiam dismissal of the writ in Kibbe was based principally upon two considerations: (1) that the crucial issue was not raised in
the District Court because of failure to object to a jury instruction, thus
invoking Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides
that "[n]o party may assign as error the giving . . . [of] an instruction
unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict,"
and (2) that the crucial issue had in addition not explicitly been raised
in the petition for certiorari. 480 U. S., at 259, 260. Of course, neither
circumstance exists here.

4 Relying upon, and to some extent repeating, the reasoning of its earlier

holding in United States v. Page, 808 F. 2d 723 (1981), the Court of Appeals
said the following:

"We have previously held that a prosecutor has the duty to present
substantial exculpatory evidence to the grand jury. Although we do not
require the prosecutor to `ferret out and present every bit of potentially
exculpatory evidence,' we do require that substantial exculpatory evidence
discovered during the course of an investigation be revealed to the grand
jury. Other courts have also recognized that such a duty exists. This
requirement promotes judicial economy because `if a fully informed grand
jury cannot find probable cause to indict, there is little chance the prosecution could have proved guilt beyond a reasonable doubt to a fully informed
petit jury.' " 899 F. 2d 898, 900 (1990) (citations omitted).

This excerpt from the opinion below should make abundantly clear that,
contrary to the dissent's mystifying assertion, see post, at 58, and n. 3, we
premise our grant of certiorari not upon the Tenth Circuit's having "passed
on" the issue in its prior Page decision, but rather upon its having done
so in this case. We discuss Page only to point out that, had the Government not disputed the creation of the binding Tenth Circuit precedent in
that case, a different exercise of discretion might be appropriate.

Opinion of the Court
The dissent describes the Government as having "expresslyacknowledged [in the Court of Appeals] the responsibilities

described in Page," post, at 56 (emphasis added). It did nosuch thing. Rather, the Government acknowledged "that
it has certain responsibilities under . . . Page." Brief forUnited States in Response to Appellee's Brief in Nos. 88-
2827, 88-2843 (CA10), p. 9 (emphasis added). It conceded,in other words, not that the responsibilities

Page had im-posed were proper, but merely that Page had imposed

them--over the protests of the Government, but in a judg-ment that was nonetheless binding precedent for the panel
below. The dissent would apparently impose, as an absolutecondition to our granting certiorari upon an issue decided by
a lower court, that a party demand overruling of a squarelyapplicable, recent circuit precedent, even though that precedent was established in a case to which the party itself wasprivy and over the party's vigorous objection, see

Page, 808F. 2d, at 727 ("The government counters that a prosecutor

has no duty to disclose exculpatory evidence [to a grandjury]"), and even though no "intervening developments in
the law," post, at 59, n. 5, had occurred. That seems to usunreasonable.

In short, having reconsidered the precise question we re-solved when this petition for review was granted, we again
answer it the same way. It is a permissible exercise of ourdiscretion to undertake review of an important issue expressly decided by a federal court 5 where, although the peti5 Where certiorari is sought to a state court, "due regard for the appropriate relationship of this Court to state courts," McGoldrick v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 309 U. S. 430, 434-435 (1940), may suggest
greater restraint in applying our "pressed or passed upon" rule. In that
context, the absence of challenge to a seemingly settled federal rule deprives the state court of an opportunity to rest its decision on an adequate
and independent state ground. See Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 222
(1983), cited by the dissent post, at 59; see also Bankers Life & Casualty
Co. v. Crenshaw, 486 U. S. 71, 79-80 (1988). But cf. Cohen v. Cowles

tioner did not contest the issue in the case immediately athand, it did so as a party to the recent proceeding upon which

the lower courts relied for their resolution of the issue, anddid not concede in the current case the correctness of that
precedent. Undoubtedly the United States benefits fromthis rule more often than other parties; but that is inevitably
true of most desirable rules of procedure or jurisdiction thatwe announce, the United States being the most frequent litigant in our courts. Since we announce the rule to be appli-cable to all parties; since we have recently applied a similar
rule (indeed, a rule even more broadly cast) to the disadvantage of the United States, see Stevens v. Department of
Treasury, 500 U. S. 1 (1991); and since the dissenters them-selves have approved the application of this rule (or a

broader one) in circumstances rationally indistinguishablefrom those before us, see n. 2, supra; the dissent's suggestion
that in deciding this case "the Court appears to favor theGovernment over the ordinary litigant," post, at 59, and
compromises its "obligation to administer justice impar-tially,"

ibid., needs no response.

Respondent does not contend that the Fifth Amendmentitself obliges the prosecutor to disclose substantial exculpatory evidence in his possession to the grand jury. Instead,building on our statement that the federal courts "may,

Hasting, 461 U. S. 499, 505 (1983), he argues that imposi-tion of the Tenth Circuit's disclosure rule is supported by the

courts' "supervisory power." We think not. Hasting, andthe cases that rely upon the principle it expresses, deal
strictly with the courts' power to control their own proce-dures. See, e. g., Jencks v. United States, 353 U. S. 657, 667-

the state supreme court actually considered and decided").

668 (1957); McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332 (1943).That power has been applied not only to improve the truthfinding process of the trial, see, e. g., Mesarosh v. UnitedStates, 352 U. S. 1, 9-14 (1956), but also to prevent parties
from reaping benefit or incurring harm from violations ofsubstantive or procedural rules (imposed by the Constitution
or laws) governing matters apart from the trial itself, see,
e. g., Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 (1914). Thus,Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U. S. 250 (1988),

makes clear that the supervisory power can be used to dis-miss an indictment because of misconduct before the grand
jury, at least where that misconduct amounts to a violationof one of those "few, clear rules which were carefully drafted
and approved by this Court and by Congress to ensure theintegrity of the grand jury's functions,"

United States v.Mechanik, 475 U. S. 66, 74 (1986) (
O'Connor, J., concurringin judgment).

We did not hold in Bank of Nova Scotia, however, that thecourts' supervisory power could be used, not merely as a

means of enforcing or vindicating legally compelled stand6 Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure contains a number
of such rules, providing, for example, that "no person other than the jurors
may be present while the grand jury is deliberating or voting," Rule 6(d),
and placing strict controls on disclosure of "matters occurring before the
grand jury," Rule 6(e); see generally United States v. Sells Engineering,
Inc., 463 U. S. 418 (1983). Additional standards of behavior for prosecutors (and others) are set forth in the United States Code. See 18 U. S. C.

$$ 6002, 6003 (setting forth procedures for granting a witness immunity
from prosecution); $ 1623 (criminalizing false declarations before grand
jury); $ 2515 (prohibiting grand jury use of unlawfully intercepted wire or
oral communications); $ 1622 (criminalizing subornation of perjury). That
some of the misconduct alleged in Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States,
487 U. S. 250 (1988), was not specifically proscribed by Rule, statute, or
the Constitution does not make the case stand for a judicially prescribable
grand jury code, as the dissent suggests, see post, at 64-65. All of the
allegations of violation were dismissed by the Court--without considering
their validity in law--for failure to meet Nova Scotia's dismissal standard.
See Bank of Nova Scotia, supra, at 261.

ards of prosecutorial conduct before the grand jury, but as a
means of prescribing those standards of prosecutorial conduct in the first instance--just as it may be used as a means
of establishing standards of prosecutorial conduct before the
courts themselves. It is this latter exercise that respondent
demands. Because the grand jury is an institution separate
from the courts, over whose functioning the courts do not
preside, we think it clear that, as a general matter at least,
no such "supervisory" judicial authority exists, and that the
disclosure rule applied here exceeded the Tenth Circuit's
authority.

A

"[R]ooted in long centuries of Anglo-American history,"
Hannah v. Larche, 363 U. S. 420, 490 (1960) (Frankfurter, J.,
concurring in result), the grand jury is mentioned in the Bill
of Rights, but not in the body of the Constitution. It has
not been textually assigned, therefore, to any of the branches
described in the first three Articles. It " `is a constitutional
fixture in its own right.' " United States v. Chanen, 549
F. 2d 1306, 1312 (CA9) (quoting Nixon v. Sirica, 159 U. S.

denied, 434 U. S. 825 (1977). In fact the whole theory of its
function is that it belongs to no branch of the institutional
Government, serving as a kind of buffer or referee between
the Government and the people. See Stirone v. United
States, 361 U. S. 212, 218 (1960); Hale v. Henkel, 201 U. S. 43,
61 (1906); G. Edwards, The Grand Jury 28-32 (1906). Although the grand jury normally operates, of course, in the
courthouse and under judicial auspices, its institutional relationship with the Judicial Branch has traditionally been, so
to speak, at arm's length. Judges' direct involvement in the
functioning of the grand jury has generally been confined to
the constitutive one of calling the grand jurors together and
administering their oaths of office. See United States v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338, 343 (1974); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 6(a).

48 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMS

Opinion of the Court
The grand jury's functional independence from the JudicialBranch is evident both in the scope of its power to investigate criminal wrongdoing and in the manner in which thatpower is exercised. "Unlike [a] [c]ourt, whose jurisdiction is
predicated upon a specific case or controversy, the grand jury
`can investigate merely on suspicion that the law is beingviolated, or even because it wants assurance that it is not.' "

United States v. R. Enterprises, Inc., 498 U. S. 292, 297(1991) (quoting

United States v. Morton Salt Co., 338 U. S.
632, 642-643 (1950)). It need not identify the offender itsuspects, or even "the precise nature of the offense" it is

investigating. Blair v. United States, 250 U. S. 273, 282
(1919). The grand jury requires no authorization from its
constituting court to initiate an investigation, see Hale,
supra, at 59-60, 65, nor does the prosecutor require leave of
court to seek a grand jury indictment. And in its day-today functioning, the grand jury generally operates without
the interference of a presiding judge. See Calandra, supra,
at 343. It swears in its own witnesses, Fed. Rule Crim.
Proc. 6(c), and deliberates in total secrecy, see United States
v. Sells Engineering, Inc., 463 U. S. 418, 424-425 (1983).

True, the grand jury cannot compel the appearance of
witnesses and the production of evidence, and must appeal
to the court when such compulsion is required. See, e. g.,
Brown v. United States, 359 U. S. 41, 49 (1959). And the
court will refuse to lend its assistance when the compulsion
the grand jury seeks would override rights accorded by the
Constitution, see, e. g., Gravel v. United States, 408 U. S. 606
(1972) (grand jury subpoena effectively qualified by order
limiting questioning so as to preserve Speech or Debate
Clause immunity), or even testimonial privileges recognized
by the common law, see In re Grand Jury Investigation of
Hugle, 754 F. 2d 863 (CA9 1985) (opinion of Kennedy, J.)
(same with respect to privilege for confidential marital communications). Even in this setting, however, we have insisted that the grand jury remain "free to pursue its investi504us1$68I 04-04-96 20:08:25 PAGES OPINPGT

gations unhindered by external influence or supervision solong as it does not trench upon the legitimate rights of any

witness called before it." United States v. Dionisio, 410U. S. 1, 17-18 (1973). Recognizing this tradition of independence, we have said that the Fifth Amendment's "constitutional guarantee presupposes an investigative body `actingindependently of either prosecuting attorney

or judge'. . . ."
Id., at 16 (emphasis added) (quoting Stirone, supra, at 218).No doubt in view of the grand jury proceeding's status as

other than a constituent element of a "criminal prosecu-tio[n]," U. S. Const., Amdt. 6, we have said that certain constitutional protections afforded defendants in criminal proceedings have no application before that body. The Double
Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not bar a
grand jury from returning an indictment when a prior grand
jury has refused to do so. See Ex parte United States, 287
U. S. 241, 250-251 (1932); United States v. Thompson, 251
U. S. 407, 413-415 (1920). We have twice suggested, though
not held, that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel does
not attach when an individual is summoned to appear before
a grand jury, even if he is the subject of the investigation.
See United States v. Mandujano, 425 U. S. 564, 581 (1976)
(plurality opinion); In re Groban, 352 U. S. 330, 333 (1957);
see also Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 6(d). And although "the
grand jury may not force a witness to answer questions in
violation of [the Fifth Amendment's] constitutional guarantee" against self-incrimination, Calandra, supra, at 346 (citing Kastigar v. United States, 406 U. S. 441 (1972)), our cases
suggest that an indictment obtained through the use of
evidence previously obtained in violation of the privilege
against self-incrimination "is nevertheless valid." Calandra, supra, at 346; see Lawn v. United States, 355 U. S. 339,
348-350 (1958); United States v. Blue, 384 U. S. 251, 255,
n. 3 (1966).

Given the grand jury's operational separateness from its
constituting court, it should come as no surprise that we

50 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMS

Opinion of the Court
have been reluctant to invoke the judicial supervisory power
as a basis for prescribing modes of grand jury procedure.
Over the years, we have received many requests to exercise
supervision over the grand jury's evidence-taking process,
but we have refused them all, including some more appealing
than the one presented today. In United States v. Calandra, supra, a grand jury witness faced questions that were
allegedly based upon physical evidence the Government had
obtained through a violation of the Fourth Amendment; we
rejected the proposal that the exclusionary rule be extended
to grand jury proceedings, because of "the potential injury
to the historic role and functions of the grand jury." 414
U. S., at 349. In Costello v. United States, 350 U. S. 359
(1956), we declined to enforce the hearsay rule in grand jury
proceedings, since that "would run counter to the whole
history of the grand jury institution, in which laymen conduct their inquiries unfettered by technical rules." Id., at
364.

These authorities suggest that any power federal courts
may have to fashion, on their own initiative, rules of grand
jury procedure is a very limited one, not remotely comparable to the power they maintain over their own proceedings.
See United States v. Chanen, 549 F. 2d, at 1313. It certainly
would not permit judicial reshaping of the grand jury institution, substantially altering the traditional relationships between the prosecutor, the constituting court, and the grand
jury itself. Cf., e. g., United States v. Payner, 447 U. S. 727,
736 (1980) (supervisory power may not be applied to permit
defendant to invoke third party's Fourth Amendment
rights); see generally Beale, Reconsidering Supervisory
Power in Criminal Cases: Constitutional and Statutory Limits on the Authority of the Federal Courts, 84 Colum. L. Rev.
1433, 1490-1494, 1522 (1984). As we proceed to discuss, that
would be the consequence of the proposed rule here.

Respondent argues that the Court of Appeals' rule canbe justified as a sort of Fifth Amendment "common law," a

necessary means of assuring the constitutional right to thejudgment "of an independent and informed grand jury,"
Wood v. Georgia, 370 U. S. 375, 390 (1962). Brief for Re-spondent 27. Respondent makes a generalized appeal to
functional notions: Judicial supervision of the quantity andquality of the evidence relied upon by the grand jury plainly
facilitates, he says, the grand jury's performance of its twinhistorical responsibilities, i. e., bringing to trial those who
may be justly accused and shielding the innocent from un-founded accusation and prosecution. See, e. g., Stirone v.
United States, 361 U. S., at 218, n. 3. We do not agree. Therule would neither preserve nor enhance the traditional functioning of the institution that the Fifth Amendment de-mands. To the contrary, requiring the prosecutor to present
exculpatory as well as inculpatory evidence would alter thegrand jury's historical role, transforming it from an accusatory to an adjudicatory body.It is axiomatic that the grand jury sits not to determine
guilt or innocence, but to assess whether there is adequatebasis for bringing a criminal charge. See

United States v.
Calandra, 414 U. S., at 343. That has always been so; andto make the assessment it has always been thought sufficient

to hear only the prosecutor's side. As Blackstone describedthe prevailing practice in 18th-century England, the grand
jury was "only to hear evidence on behalf of the prosecu-tion[,] for the finding of an indictment is only in the nature
of an enquiry or accusation, which is afterwards to be triedand determined." 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 300
(1769); see also 2 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 157 (1st Am.ed. 1847). So also in the United States. According to the
description of an early American court, three years beforethe Fifth Amendment was ratified, it is the grand jury's function not "to enquire . . . upon what foundation [the charge

Opinion of the Court
may be] denied," or otherwise to try the suspect's defenses,
but only to examine "upon what foundation [the charge] is
made" by the prosecutor. Respublica v. Shaffer, 1 Dall. 236
(O. T. Phila. 1788); see also F. Wharton, Criminal Pleading
and Practice $ 360, pp. 248-249 (8th ed. 1880). As a consequence, neither in this country nor in England has the suspect under investigation by the grand jury ever been thought
to have a right to testify or to have exculpatory evidence
presented. See 2 Hale, supra, at 157; United States ex rel.
McCann v. Thompson, 144 F. 2d 604, 605-606 (CA2), cert.
denied, 323 U. S. 790 (1944).

Imposing upon the prosecutor a legal obligation to present
exculpatory evidence in his possession would be incompatible
with this system. If a "balanced" assessment of the entire
matter is the objective, surely the first thing to be done--
rather than requiring the prosecutor to say what he knows
in defense of the target of the investigation--is to entitle the
target to tender his own defense. To require the former
while denying (as we do) the latter would be quite absurd.
It would also be quite pointless, since it would merely invite
the target to circumnavigate the system by delivering his
exculpatory evidence to the prosecutor, whereupon it would
have to be passed on to the grand jury--unless the prosecutor is willing to take the chance that a court will not deem
the evidence important enough to qualify for mandatory disclosure.7 See, e. g., United States v. Law Firm of Zimmerman & Schwartz, P. C., 738 F. Supp. 407, 411 (Colo. 1990)
(duty to disclose exculpatory evidence held satisfied when

7 How much of a gamble that is is illustrated by the Court of Appeals'
opinion in the present case. Though the court purported to be applying
the "substantial exculpatory" standard set forth in its prior Page decision,
see 899 F. 2d, at 900, portions of the opinion recite a much more inclusive
standard. See id., at 902 ("[T]he grand jury must receive any information
that is relevant to any reasonable [exculpatory] theory it may adopt"); ibid.
("We conclude, therefore, that the district court was not clearly in error
when it found that the deposition testimony was exculpatory").

aff 'd sub nom. United States v. Brown, 943 F. 2d 1246, 1257(CA10 1991).

Respondent acknowledges (as he must) that the "common
law" of the grand jury is not violated if the grand jury itselfchooses to hear no more evidence than that which suffices to

convince it an indictment is proper. Cf. Thompson, supra,at 607. Thus, had the Government offered to familiarize the
grand jury in this case with the five boxes of financial state-ments and deposition testimony alleged to contain exculpatory information, and had the grand jury rejected the offer
as pointless, respondent would presumably agree that the
resulting indictment would have been valid. Respondent
insists, however, that courts must require the modern prosecutor to alert the grand jury to the nature and extent of the
available exculpatory evidence, because otherwise the grand
jury "merely functions as an arm of the prosecution." Brief
for Respondent 27. We reject the attempt to convert a nonexistent duty of the grand jury itself into an obligation of
the prosecutor. The authority of the prosecutor to seek an
indictment has long been understood to be "coterminous with
the authority of the grand jury to entertain [the prosecutor's]
charges." United States v. Thompson, 251 U. S., at 414. If
the grand jury has no obligation to consider all "substantial
exculpatory" evidence, we do not understand how the prosecutor can be said to have a binding obligation to present it.

There is yet another respect in which respondent's proposal not only fails to comport with, but positively contradicts, the "common law" of the Fifth Amendment grand jury.
Motions to quash indictments based upon the sufficiency of
the evidence relied upon by the grand jury were unheard of
at common law in England, see, e. g., People v. Restenblatt,
1 Abb. Pr. 268, 269 (Ct. Gen. Sess. N. Y. 1855). And the
traditional American practice was described by Justice Nelson, riding circuit in 1852, as follows:

Opinion of the Court
"No case has been cited, nor have we been able to findany, furnishing an authority for looking into and revising

the judgment of the grand jury upon the evidence, forthe purpose of determining whether or not the finding
was founded upon sufficient proof, or whether there wasa deficiency in respect to any part of the complaint . . . ."
United States v. Reed, 27 F. Cas. 727, 738 (No. 16,134)(CC NDNY 1852).

We accepted Justice Nelson's description in Costello v.
United States, where we held that "[i]t would run counterto the whole history of the grand jury institution" to permit

an indictment to be challenged "on the ground that therewas inadequate or incompetent evidence before the grand
jury." 350 U. S., at 363-364. And we reaffirmed this prin-ciple recently in Bank of Nova Scotia, where we held that
"the mere fact that evidence itself is unreliable is not suffi-cient to require a dismissal of the indictment," and that "a
challenge to the reliability or competence of the evidencepresented to the grand jury" will not be heard. 487 U. S.,
at 261. It would make little sense, we think, to abstain fromreviewing the evidentiary support for the grand jury's judgment while scrutinizing the sufficiency of the prosecutor'spresentation. A complaint about the quality or adequacy of
the evidence can always be recast as a complaint that theprosecutor's presentation was "incomplete" or "misleading."

Our words in Costello bear repeating: Review of facially

reliance upon hearsay evidence the petitioner could have complained
about the prosecutor's introduction of it. See, e. g., United States v. Estepa, 471 F. 2d 1132, 1136-1137 (CA2 1972) (prosecutor should not introduce hearsay evidence before grand jury when direct evidence is available); see also Arenella, Reforming the Federal Grand Jury and the State

whole history of the grand jury institution[,] [and] [n]either

* * *

Echoing the reasoning of the Tenth Circuit in United
States v. Page, 808 F. 2d, at 728, respondent argues that a
rule requiring the prosecutor to disclose exculpatory evidence to the grand jury would, by removing from the docket
unjustified prosecutions, save valuable judicial time. That
depends, we suppose, upon what the ratio would turn out to
be between unjustified prosecutions eliminated and grand
jury indictments challenged--for the latter as well as the
former consume "valuable judicial time." We need not
pursue the matter; if there is an advantage to the proposal,
Congress is free to prescribe it. For the reasons set forth
above, however, we conclude that courts have no authority to
prescribe such a duty pursuant to their inherent supervisory
authority over their own proceedings. The judgment of the
Court of Appeals is accordingly reversed, and the cause
is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.

So ordered.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Blackmun and
Justice O'Connor join, and with whom Justice Thomas
joins as to Parts II and III, dissenting.

The Court's opinion announces two important changes in
the law. First, it justifies its special accommodation to the
Solicitor General in granting certiorari to review a contention that was not advanced in either the District Court or
the Court of Appeals by explaining that the fact that the
issue was raised in a different case is an adequate substitute
for raising it in this case. Second, it concludes that a federal
court has no power to enforce the prosecutor's obligation to

protect the fundamental fairness of proceedings before the
grand jury.

I

The question presented by the certiorari petition is
whether the failure to disclose substantial exculpatory evidence to the grand jury is a species of prosecutorial misconduct that may be remedied by dismissing an indictment
without prejudice. In the District Court and the Court of
Appeals both parties agreed that the answer to that question
is "yes, in an appropriate case." The only disagreement was
whether this was an appropriate case: The prosecutor vigorously argued that it was not because the undisclosed evidence was not substantial exculpatory evidence, while respondent countered that the evidence was exculpatory and
the prosecutor's misconduct warranted a dismissal with
prejudice.

In an earlier case arising in the Tenth Circuit, United
States v. Page, 808 F. 2d 723, cert. denied, 482 U. S. 918
(1987), the defendant had claimed that his indictment should
have been dismissed because the prosecutor was guilty of
misconduct during the grand jury proceedings. Specifically,
he claimed that the prosecutor had allowed the grand jury
to consider false testimony and had failed to present it with
substantial exculpatory evidence. 808 F. 2d, at 726-727.
After noting that there are "two views concerning the duty
of a prosecutor to present exculpatory evidence to a grand
jury," id., at 727, the court concluded that the "better, and
more balanced rule" is that "when substantial exculpatory
evidence is discovered in the course of an investigation, it
must be revealed to the grand jury," id., at 728 (emphasis
in original). The court declined to dismiss the indictment,
however, because the evidence withheld in that case was not
"clearly exculpatory." Ibid.

In this case the Government expressly acknowledged the
responsibilities described in Page, but argued that the with504us1$68I 04-04-96 20:08:25 PAGES OPINPGT

Stevens, J., dissenting
held evidence was not exculpatory or significant.1 Insteadof questioning the controlling rule of law, it distinguished the

facts of this case from those of an earlier case in which anindictment had been dismissed because the prosecutor had
withheld testimony that made it factually impossible for thecorporate defendant to have been guilty.

2 The Government

concluded its principal brief with a request that the courtapply the test set forth in

Bank of Nova Scotia v. UnitedStates, 487 U. S. 250 (1988), "follow the holding of Page," and

hold that dismissal was not warranted in this case becausethe withheld evidence was not substantial exculpatory evidence and respondent "was not prejudiced in any way."Brief for United States in No. 88-2827 (CA10), pp. 40-43.

After losing in the Court of Appeals, the Government re-versed its position and asked this Court to grant certiorari

1 "The government has acknowledged that it has certain responsibilities
under the case of United States v. Page, 808 F. 2d 723 (10th Cir. 1987), and
that includes a duty to not withhold substantial exculpatory evidence from
a grand jury if such exists. . . . The government would contend that . . . it
was familiar with and complied with the principles stated in the case. . . .
Considering the evidence as a whole, it is clear that the government complied with, and went beyond the requirements of Page, supra." Brief for
United States in Response to Appellee's Brief in Nos. 88-2827, 88-2843
(CA10), pp. 9-10.

2 Respondent had relied on United States v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 435

F. Supp. 610 (ND Okla. 1977). The Government distinguished the case
based on "the type of evidence excluded. In Phillips, supra, the prosecutor sent the Grand Jury home for the day, but continued questioning a
witness. In that session, outside the hearing of the Grand Jury members,
the witness, who had been granted use immunity, testified to certain information which showed that the witness had been the one who knowingly
committed an offense, and showed that the corporation had not intentionally committed an offense in that case. There was no question that the
withheld testimony made it factually impossible for the corporate defendant to have been guilty, and therefore the evidence was substantial and
exculpatory. In the instant case there is a disagreement between the government and the defendant as to whether the documents the defendant
wants presented in full are exculpatory." Brief for United States in No.
88-2827 (CA10), p. 38.

reiterated the general rule that precludes a grant of certio-rari when the question presented was "not pressed or passed

General's petition. 502 U. S. 905 (1991).The Court explains that the settled rule does not apply to
the Government's certiorari petition in this case because theGovernment raised the same question three years earlier in
the Page case and the Court of Appeals passed on the issue
in that case. Ante, at 44-45. This is a novel, and unwise,

United States v. Lovasco, 431 U. S. 783, 788, n. 7 (1977); United States
v. Ortiz, 422 U. S. 891, 898 (1975). Until today the Court has never
suggested that the fact that an argument was pressed by the litigant or
passed on by the court of appeals in a different case would satisfy this
requirement.

4 Stevens v. Department of Treasury, 500 U. S. 1 (1991), and Virginia

Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U. S. 1083 (1991), discussed by the
Court, ante, at 41-42, were routine applications of the settled rule. Although the parties may not have raised the questions presented in the
petitions for certiorari before the Courts of Appeals in those cases, the
courts treated the questions as open questions that they needed to resolve
in order to decide the cases. Similarly, in Springfield v. Kibbe, 480 U. S.
257 (1987), the Court of Appeals had expressly considered and answered
the question that Justice O'Connor thought we should decide, see id., at
263-266. This case, in contrast, involved "the routine restatement and
application of settled law by an appellate court," which we have previously
found insufficient to satisfy the "pressed or passed upon below" rule. Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 222-223 (1983).

change in the rule. We have never suggested that the fact
that a court has repeated a settled proposition of law and
applied it, without objection, in the case at hand provides a
sufficient basis for our review.5 See Illinois v. Gates, 462
U. S. 213, 222-223 (1983), and cases cited therein. If this is
to be the rule in the future, it will either provide a basis
for a significant expansion of our discretionary docket 6 or, if
applied only to benefit repetitive litigants, a special privilege
for the Federal Government.

This Court has a special obligation to administer justice
impartially and to set an example of impartiality for other
courts to emulate. When the Court appears to favor the
Government over the ordinary litigant, it seriously compromises its ability to discharge that important duty. For that

5 The Court expresses an inability to understand the difference between
the routine application, without objection, of a settled rule, on the one
hand, and the decision of an open question on a ground not argued by the
parties, on the other. The difference is best explained in light of the basic
assumption that the adversary process provides the best method of arriving at correct decisions. Rules of appellate practice generally require
that an issue be actually raised and debated by the parties if it is to be
preserved. In the exceptional case, in which an appellate court announces
a new rule that had not been debated by the parties, our review may be
appropriate to give the losing party an opportunity it would not otherwise
have to challenge the rule. In this case, however, there is no reason why
the Government could not have challenged the Page rule in this case in
the Tenth Circuit. There is no need for an exception to preserve the
losing litigant's opportunity to be heard. Moreover, the Government's
failure to object to the application of the Page rule deprived the Court of
Appeals of an opportunity to reexamine the validity of that rule in the
light of intervening developments in the law. "Sandbagging" is just as
improper in an appellate court as in a trial court.

6 The "expressed or passed on" predicate for the exercise of our jurisdiction is of special importance in determining our power to review statecourt judgments. If the Court's newly announced view that the routine
application of a settled rule satisfies the "passed on" requirement in a
federal case, I see no reason why it should not also satisfy the same requirement in a state case.

Like the Hydra slain by Hercules, prosecutorial miscon-duct has many heads. Some are cataloged in Justice Sutherland's classic opinion for the Court in Berger v. United States,295 U. S. 78 (1935):

"That the United States prosecuting attorney over-stepped the bounds of that propriety and fairness which
should characterize the conduct of such an officer in theprosecution of a criminal offense is clearly shown by the
record. He was guilty of misstating the facts in hiscross-examination of witnesses; of putting into the
mouths of such witnesses things which they had notsaid; of suggesting by his questions that statements had
been made to him personally out of court, in respect ofwhich no proof was offered; of pretending to understand
that a witness had said something which he had not saidand persistently cross-examining the witness upon that
basis; of assuming prejudicial facts not in evidence; of
7 The Court suggests that it would be "improvident" for the Court to
dismiss the writ of certiorari on the ground that the Government failed to
raise the question presented in the lower courts because respondent raised
this argument in his brief in opposition, the Court nevertheless granted
the writ, and the case has been briefed and argued. Ante, at 40. I disagree. The vote of four Justices is sufficient to grant a petition for certiorari, but that action does not preclude a majority of the Court from dismissing the writ as improvidently granted after the case has been argued.
See, e. g., NAACP v. Overstreet, 384 U. S. 118 (1966) (dismissing, after oral
argument, writ as improvidently granted over the dissent of four Justices).
We have frequently dismissed the writ as improvidently granted after the
case has been briefed and argued; in fact, we have already done so twice
this Term. See Gibson v. Florida Bar, 502 U. S. 104 (1991); PFZ Properties, Inc. v. Rodriguez, 503 U. S. 257 (1992). Although we do not always
explain the reason for the dismissal, we have on occasion dismissed the
writ for the reasons raised by the respondent in the brief in opposition.
Thus, nothing precludes the Court from dismissing the writ in this case.

bullying and arguing with witnesses; and in general, ofconducting himself in a thoroughly indecorous and improper manner. . . ."The prosecuting attorney's argument to the jury was
undignified and intemperate, containing improper insin-uations and assertions calculated to mislead the jury."
Id., at 84-85.
This, of course, is not an exhaustive list of the kinds ofimproper tactics that overzealous or misguided prosecutors

have adopted in judicial proceedings. The reported casesof this Court alone contain examples of the knowing use of
perjured testimony, Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U. S. 103 (1935),the suppression of evidence favorable to an accused person,
Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, 87-88 (1963), and misstate-ments of the law in argument to the jury, Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320, 336 (1985), to name just a few.Nor has prosecutorial misconduct been limited to judicial
proceedings: The reported cases indicate that it has some-times infected grand jury proceedings as well. The cases
contain examples of prosecutors presenting perjured testi-mony,

examination of a witness, United States v. Lawson, 502F. Supp. 158, 162, and nn. 6-7 (Md. 1980).

Justice Sutherland's identification of the basic reason whythat sort of misconduct is intolerable merits repetition:

"The United States Attorney is the representative notof an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as com-pelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that itshall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such,
he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant ofthe law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not
escape or innocence suffer. He may prosecute withearnestness and vigor--indeed, he should do so. But,
while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty tostrike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from
improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful con-viction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring
about a just one." Berger v. United States, 295 U. S.,at 88.

It is equally clear that the prosecutor has the same dutyto refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a
wrongful indictment. Indeed, the prosecutor's duty to pro-tect the fundamental fairness of judicial proceedings assumes
special importance when he is presenting evidence to a grandjury. As the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit recognized, "the costs of continued unchecked prosecutorial mis-conduct" before the grand jury are particularly substantial
because there

"the prosecutor operates without the check of a judgeor a trained legal adversary, and virtually immune from

public scrutiny. The prosecutor's abuse of his special
the polygraph evidence was inadmissible." United States v. Roberts, 481
F. Supp., at 1389.

relationship to the grand jury poses an enormous risk to
defendants as well. For while in theory a trial provides
the defendant with a full opportunity to contest and
disprove the charges against him, in practice, the handing up of an indictment will often have a devastating
personal and professional impact that a later dismissal
or acquittal can never undo. Where the potential for
abuse is so great, and the consequences of a mistaken
indictment so serious, the ethical responsibilities of the
prosecutor, and the obligation of the judiciary to protect
against even the appearance of unfairness, are correspondingly heightened." United States v. Serubo, 604
F. 2d 807, 817 (1979).

In his dissent in United States v. Ciambrone, 601 F. 2d 616
(CA2 1979), Judge Friendly also recognized the prosecutor's
special role in grand jury proceedings:

"As the Supreme Court has noted, `the Founders
thought the grand jury so essential to basic liberties that
they provided in the Fifth Amendment that federal
prosecution for serious crimes can only be instituted
by "a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury." '
United States v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338, 343, . . . (1974).
Before the grand jury the prosecutor has the dual role
of pressing for an indictment and of being the grand jury
adviser. In case of conflict, the latter duty must take
precedence. United States v. Remington, 208 F. 2d 567,
573-74 (2d Cir. 1953) (L. Hand, J., dissenting), cert.
denied, 347 U. S. 913 . . . (1954).

"The ex parte character of grand jury proceedings
makes it peculiarly important for a federal prosecutor
to remember that, in the familiar phrase, the interest of
the United States `in a criminal prosecution is not that
it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.'

Id., at 628-629.9

The standard for judging the consequences of prosecutorial misconduct during grand jury proceedings is essentially
the same as the standard applicable to trials. In United
States v. Mechanik, 475 U. S. 66 (1986), we held that there
was "no reason not to apply [the harmless error rule] to `er-rors, defects, irregularities, or variances' occurring before a

grand jury just as we have applied it to such error occurringin the criminal trial itself,"

id., at 71-72. We repeated that
holding in Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U. S.
250 (1988), when we rejected a defendant's argument thatan indictment should be dismissed because of prosecutorial

misconduct and irregularities in proceedings before thegrand jury. Referring to the prosecutor's misconduct before
the grand jury, we "concluded that our customary harmless-error inquiry is applicable where, as in the cases before us,
a court is asked to dismiss an indictment prior to the conclu-sion of the trial."

Id., at 256. Moreover, in reviewing the
instances of misconduct in that case, we applied precisely the

9 Although the majority in Ciambrone did not agree with Judge Friendly's appraisal of the prejudicial impact of the misconduct in that case, it
also recognized the prosecutor's duty to avoid fundamentally unfair tactics
during the grand jury proceedings. Judge Mansfield explained:

"On the other hand, the prosecutor's right to exercise some discretion
and selectivity in the presentation of evidence to a grand jury does not
entitle him to mislead it or to engage in fundamentally unfair tactics before it. The prosecutor, for instance, may not obtain an indictment on the
basis of evidence known to him to be perjurious, United States v. Basurto,
497 F. 2d 781, 785-86 (9th Cir. 1974), or by leading it to believe that it has
received eyewitness rather than hearsay testimony, United States v. Estepa, 471 F. 2d 1132, 1136-37 (2d Cir. 1972). We would add that where a
prosecutor is aware of any substantial evidence negating guilt he should,
in the interest of justice, make it known to the grand jury, at least where
it might reasonably be expected to lead the jury not to indict. See ABA
Project on Standards for Criminal Justice--the Prosecution Function,

$ 3.6, pp. 90-91." 601 F. 2d, at 623.

Stevens, J., dissenting
same standard to the prosecutor's violations of Rule 6 of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and to his violations of
the general duty of fairness that applies to all judicial proceedings. This point is illustrated by the Court's comments
on the prosecutor's abuse of a witness:

"The District Court found that a prosecutor was abusive to an expert defense witness during a recess and in
the hearing of some grand jurors. Although the Government concedes that the treatment of the expert tax
witness was improper, the witness himself testified that
his testimony was unaffected by this misconduct. The
prosecutors instructed the grand jury to disregard anything they may have heard in conversations between a
prosecutor and a witness, and explained to the grand
jury that such conversations should have no influence on
its deliberations. App. 191. In light of these ameliorative measures, there is nothing to indicate that the
prosecutor's conduct toward this witness substantially
affected the grand jury's evaluation of the testimony or
its decision to indict." 487 U. S., at 261.

Unquestionably, the plain implication of that discussion is
that if the misconduct, even though not expressly forbidden
by any written rule, had played a critical role in persuading
the jury to return the indictment, dismissal would have
been required.

In an opinion that I find difficult to comprehend, the Court
today repudiates the assumptions underlying these cases and
seems to suggest that the court has no authority to supervise
the conduct of the prosecutor in grand jury proceedings so
long as he follows the dictates of the Constitution, applicable
statutes, and Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Court purports to support this conclusion by invoking the doctrine of separation of powers and citing a
string of cases in which we have declined to impose categori504us1$68I 04-04-96 20:08:25 PAGES OPINPGT

Stevens, J., dissenting
cal restraints on the grand jury. Needless to say, theCourt's reasoning is unpersuasive.

Although the grand jury has not been "textually assigned"to "any of the branches described in the first three Articles"
of the Constitution, ante, at 47, it is not an autonomous
body completely beyond the reach of the other branches.Throughout its life, from the moment it is convened until it is

discharged, the grand jury is subject to the control of the court.As Judge Learned Hand recognized over 60 years ago, "a
grand jury is neither an officer nor an agent of the UnitedStates, but a part of the court."

Falter v. United States, 23
F. 2d 420, 425 (CA2), cert. denied, 277 U. S. 590 (1928). ThisCourt has similarly characterized the grand jury:

"A grand jury is clothed with great independence inmany areas, but it remains an appendage of the court,
powerless to perform its investigative function withoutthe court's aid, because powerless itself to compel the
testimony of witnesses. It is the court's process which
summons the witness to attend and give testimony, andit is the court which must compel a witness to testify if,

after appearing, he refuses to do so." Brown v. United

States, 359 U. S. 41, 49 (1959).

See also Blair v. United States, 250 U. S. 273, 280 (1919) ("At
the foundation of our Federal Government the inquisitorial
function of the grand jury and the compulsion of witnesseswere recognized as incidents of the judicial power of the

United States"); United States v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338,346, and n. 4 (1974).

This Court has, of course, long recognized that the grand
jury has wide latitude to investigate violations of federal law
as it deems appropriate and need not obtain permission from
either the court or the prosecutor. See, e. g., id., at 343; Costello v. United States, 350 U. S. 359, 362 (1956); Hale v.
Henkel, 201 U. S. 43, 65 (1906). Correspondingly, we have
acknowledged that "its operation generally is unrestrained

by the technical procedural and evidentiary rules governingthe conduct of criminal trials." Calandra, 414 U. S., at 343.

But this is because Congress and the Court have generallythought it best not to impose procedural restraints on the
grand jury; it is not because they lack all power to do so.10To the contrary, the Court has recognized that it has the
authority to create and enforce limited rules applicable ingrand jury proceedings. Thus, for example, the Court has
said that the grand jury "may not itself violate a valid privi-lege, whether established by the Constitution, statutes, or
the common law." Id., at 346. And the Court may preventa grand jury from violating such a privilege by quashing or
modifying a subpoena, id., at 346, n. 4, or issuing a protec-tive order forbidding questions in violation of the privilege,
Gravel v. United States, 408 U. S. 606, 628-629 (1972). More-over, there are, as the Court notes, ante, at 49, a series of
cases in which we declined to impose categorical restraintson the grand jury. In none of those cases, however, did we
question our power to reach a contrary result.11Although the Court recognizes that it may invoke its supervisory authority to fashion and enforce privilege rulesapplicable in grand jury proceedings, ibid., and suggests that

10 Indeed, even the Court acknowledges that Congress has the power to
regulate the grand jury, for it concedes that Congress "is free to prescribe"
a rule requiring the prosecutor to disclose substantial exculpatory evidence to the grand jury. Ante, at 55.

11 In Costello v. United States, 350 U. S. 359, 363 (1956), for example, the

Court held that an indictment based solely on hearsay evidence is not
invalid under the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The Court
then rejected the petitioner's argument that it should invoke "its power
to supervise the administration of justice in federal courts" to create a
rule permitting defendants to challenge indictments based on unreliable
hearsay evidence. The Court declined to exercise its power in this way
because "[n]o persuasive reasons are advanced for establishing such a rule.
It would run counter to the whole history of the grand jury institution, in
which laymen conduct their inquiries unfettered by technical rules. Neither justice nor the concept of a fair trial requires such a change." Id.,

it may also invoke its supervisory authority to fashion otherlimited rules of grand jury procedure,

ante, at 48-49, it concludes that it has no authority to prescribe "standards of prose-cutorial conduct before the grand jury,"

ante, at 46-47, because that would alter the grand jury's historic role as an
independent, inquisitorial institution. I disagree.We do not protect the integrity and independence of the

grand jury by closing our eyes to the countless forms ofprosecutorial misconduct that may occur inside the secrecy
of the grand jury room. After all, the grand jury is notmerely an investigatory body; it also serves as a "protector
of citizens against arbitrary and oppressive governmentalaction."

United States v. Calandra, 414 U. S., at 343. Explaining why the grand jury must be both "independent"
and "informed," the Court wrote in Wood v. Georgia, 370U. S. 375 (1962):

"Historically, this body has been regarded as a primary security to the innocent against hasty, malicious
and oppressive persecution; it serves the invaluablefunction in our society of standing between the accuser

and the accused, whether the latter be an individual, mi-nority group, or other, to determine whether a charge is
founded upon reason or was dictated by an intimidatingpower or by malice and personal ill will."

Id., at 390.

It blinks reality to say that the grand jury can adequatelyperform this important historic role if it is intentionally misled by the prosecutor--on whose knowledge of the law andfacts of the underlying criminal investigation the jurors will,
of necessity, rely.

Unlike the Court, I am unwilling to hold that countless
forms of prosecutorial misconduct must be tolerated--no
matter how prejudicial they may be, or how seriously they
may distort the legitimate function of the grand jury--simply because they are not proscribed by Rule 6 of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure or a statute that is applicable

in grand jury proceedings. Such a sharp break with the tra-ditional role of the federal judiciary is unprecedented, unwarranted, and unwise. Unrestrained prosecutorial misconductin grand jury proceedings is inconsistent with the administration of justice in the federal courts and should be re-dressed in appropriate cases by the dismissal of indictments
obtained by improper methods.12

III
What, then, is the proper disposition of this case? I agreewith the Government that the prosecutor is not required to

place all exculpatory evidence before the grand jury. Agrand jury proceeding is an ex parte investigatory proceeding to determine whether there is probable cause to believea violation of the criminal laws has occurred, not a trial.
Requiring the prosecutor to ferret out and present all evi-dence that could be used at trial to create a reasonable doubt
as to the defendant's guilt would be inconsistent with thepurpose of the grand jury proceeding and would place significant burdens on the investigation. But that does notmean that the prosecutor may mislead the grand jury into
believing that there is probable cause to indict by withhold-ing clear evidence to the contrary. I thus agree with the
Department of Justice that "when a prosecutor conducting agrand jury inquiry is personally aware of substantial evidence which directly negates the guilt of a subject of theinvestigation, the prosecutor must present or otherwise dis12 Although the Court's opinion barely mentions the fact that the grand
jury was intended to serve the invaluable function of standing between
the accuser and the accused, I must assume that in a proper case it will
acknowledge--as even the Solicitor General does--that unrestrained
prosecutorial misconduct in grand jury proceedings "could so subvert the
integrity of the grand jury process as to justify judicial intervention. Cf.
Franks v. Delaware, 438 U. S. 154, 164-171 (1978) (discussing analogous
considerations in holding that a search warrant affidavit may be challenged when supported by deliberately false police statements)." Brief

close such evidence to the grand jury before seeking an in-dictment against such a person." U. S. Dept. of Justice,

United States Attorneys' Manual || 9-11.233, p. 88 (1988).Although I question whether the evidence withheld in this
case directly negates respondent's guilt,13 I need not resolvemy doubts because the Solicitor General did not ask the
Court to review the nature of the evidence withheld. In-stead, he asked us to decide the legal question whether an
indictment may be dismissed because the prosecutor failedto present exculpatory evidence. Unlike the Court and the
Solicitor General, I believe the answer to that question isyes, if the withheld evidence would plainly preclude a finding
of probable cause. I therefore cannot endorse the Court'sopinion.

More importantly, because I am so firmly opposed to theCourt's favored treatment of the Government as a litigator,
I would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidentlygranted.

13 I am reluctant to rely on the lower courts' judgment in this regard,
as they apparently applied a more lenient legal standard. The District
Court dismissed the indictment because the "information withheld raises
reasonable doubt about the Defendant's intent to defraud," and thus "renders the grand jury's decision to indict gravely suspect." App. to Pet. for
Cert. 26a. The Court of Appeals affirmed this decision because it was not
"clearly erroneous." 899 F. 2d 898, 902-904 (CA10 1990).

71OCTOBER TERM, 1991
Syllabus

FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA
certiorari to the supreme court of louisiana
No. 90-5844. Argued November 4, 1991--Decided May 18, 1992
Under Louisiana law, a criminal defendant found not guilty by reason of

insanity may be committed to a psychiatric hospital. If a hospital review committee thereafter recommends that the acquittee be released,
the trial court must hold a hearing to determine whether he is dangerous to himself or others. If he is found to be dangerous, he may be
returned to the hospital whether or not he is then mentally ill. Pursuant to this statutory scheme, a state court ordered petitioner Foucha,
an insanity acquittee, returned to the mental institution to which he had
been committed, ruling that he was dangerous on the basis of, inter
alia, a doctor's testimony that he had recovered from the drug induced
psychosis from which he suffered upon commitment and was "in good
shape" mentally; that he had, however, an antisocial personality, a condition that is not a mental disease and is untreatable; that he had been
involved in several altercations at the institution; and that, accordingly,
the doctor would not "feel comfortable in certifying that he would not
be a danger to himself or to other people." The State Court of Appeal
refused supervisory writs, and the State Supreme Court affirmed, holding, among other things, that Jones v. United States, 463 U. S. 354, did
not require Foucha's release and that the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment was not violated by the statutory provision
permitting confinement of an insanity acquittee based on dangerousness alone.

Held: The judgment is reversed.
563 So. 2d 1138, reversed.

Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I and II, concluding that the Louisiana statute violates the Due
Process Clause because it allows an insanity acquittee to be committed
to a mental institution until he is able to demonstrate that he is not
dangerous to himself and others, even though he does not suffer from
any mental illness. Although Jones, supra, acknowledged that an insanity acquittee could be committed, the Court also held that, as a matter of due process, he is entitled to release when he has recovered his
sanity or is no longer dangerous, id., at 368, i. e., he may be held as long
as he is both mentally ill and dangerous, but no longer. Here, since the
State does not contend that Foucha was mentally ill at the time of the

72 FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA

Syllabus
trial court's hearing, the basis for holding him in a psychiatric facility
as an insanity acquittee has disappeared, and the State is no longer
entitled to hold him on that basis. There are at least three difficulties
with the State's attempt to perpetuate his confinement on the basis of
his antisocial personality. First, even if his continued confinement were
constitutionally permissible, keeping him against his will in a mental
institution is improper absent a determination in civil commitment proceedings of current mental illness and dangerousness. Vitek v. Jones,
445 U. S. 480, 492. Due process requires that the nature of commitment
bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual is
committed. See, e. g., Jones v. United States, supra, at 368. Second,
if he can no longer be held as an insanity acquittee in a mental hospital, he is entitled to constitutionally adequate procedures to establish
the grounds for his confinement. Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U. S. 715.
Third, the substantive component of the Due Process Clause bars certain arbitrary, wrongful government actions regardless of the fairness
of the procedures used to implement them. Zinermon v. Burch, 494

U. S. 113, 125. Although a State may imprison convicted criminals for
the purposes of deterrence and retribution, Louisiana has no such interest here, since Foucha was not convicted and may not be punished.
Jones, 463 U. S., at 369. Moreover, although the State may confine a
person if it shows by clear and convincing evidence that he is mentally
ill and dangerous, id., at 362, Louisiana has not carried that burden here.
Furthermore, United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739--in which this
Court held that in certain narrow circumstances pretrial detainees who
pose a danger to others or the community may be subject to limited
confinement--does not save the state statute. Unlike the sharply focused statutory scheme at issue in Salerno, the Louisiana scheme is not
carefully limited. Pp. 75-85.

Pamela S. Moran argued the cause for respondent. Withher on the brief was Harry F. Connick.*

Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court, ex-cept as to Part III.
When a defendant in a criminal case pending in Louisianais found not guilty by reason of insanity, he is committed to
a psychiatric hospital unless he proves that he is not danger-ous. This is so whether or not he is then insane. After
commitment, if the acquittee or the superintendent beginsrelease proceedings, a review panel at the hospital makes a
written report on the patient's mental condition and whetherhe can be released without danger to himself or others. If
release is recommended, the court must hold a hearing todetermine dangerousness; the acquittee has the burden of
proving that he is not dangerous. If found to be dangerous,the acquittee may be returned to the mental institution
whether or not he is then mentally ill. Petitioner contendsthat this scheme denies him due process and equal protection
because it allows a person acquitted by reason of insanityto be committed to a mental institution until he is able to
demonstrate that he is not dangerous to himself and others,even though he does not suffer from any mental illness.

Opinion of the Court
guish right from wrong and was insane at the time of theoffense.

1 On October 12, 1984, the trial court ruled that

Foucha was not guilty by reason of insanity, finding that he"is unable to appreciate the usual, natural and probable consequences of his acts; that he is unable to distinguish rightfrom wrong; that he is a menace to himself and others; and
that he was insane at the time of the commission of the abovecrimes and that he is presently insane."

Id., at 6. He wascommitted to the East Feliciana Forensic Facility until such

time as doctors recommend that he be released, and untilfurther order of the court. In 1988, the superintendent of
Feliciana recommended that Foucha be discharged or re-leased. A three-member panel was convened at the institution to determine Foucha's current condition and whether hecould be released or placed on probation without being a
danger to others or himself. On March 21, 1988, the panelreported that there had been no evidence of mental illness
since admission and recommended that Foucha be condition-ally discharged.

2 The trial judge appointed a two-member

sanity commission made up of the same two doctors who hadconducted the pretrial examination. Their written report

stated that Foucha "is presently in remission from mentalillness [but] [w]e cannot certify that he would not constitute

1 Louisiana law provides: "If the circumstances indicate that because of
a mental disease or mental defect the offender was incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong with reference to the conduct in question, the offender shall be exempt from criminal responsibility." La. Rev.
Stat. Ann. $ 14:14 (West 1986). Justice Kennedy disregards the fact
that the State makes no claim that Foucha was criminally responsible or
that it is entitled to punish Foucha as a criminal.

2 The panel unanimously recommended that petitioner be conditionally

discharged with recommendations that he (1) be placed on probation; (2)
remain free from intoxicating and mind-altering substances; (3) attend a
substance abuse clinic on a regular basis; (4) submit to regular and random
urine drug screening; and (5) be actively employed or seeking employment. App. 10-11.

Although the panel recited that it was charged with determining dangerousness, its report did not expressly make a finding in that regard.

a menace to himself or others if released." Id., at 12. Oneof the doctors testified at a hearing that upon commitment

Foucha probably suffered from a drug induced psychosis butthat he had recovered from that temporary condition; that
he evidenced no signs of psychosis or neurosis and was in"good shape" mentally; that he had, however, an antisocial
personality, a condition that is not a mental disease and thatis untreatable. The doctor also testified that Foucha had
been involved in several altercations at Feliciana and thathe, the doctor, would not "feel comfortable in certifying that
[Foucha] would not be a danger to himself or to other peo-ple."

Id., at 18.After it was stipulated that the other doctor, if he were

present, would give essentially the same testimony, the courtruled that Foucha was dangerous to himself and others and
ordered him returned to the mental institution. The Courtof Appeal refused supervisory writs, and the State Supreme
Court affirmed, holding that Foucha had not carried the bur-den placed upon him by statute to prove that he was not
dangerous, that our decision in Jones v. United States, 463U. S. 354 (1983), did not require Foucha's release, and that
neither the Due Process Clause nor the Equal ProtectionClause was violated by the statutory provision permitting
confinement of an insanity acquittee based on dangerous-ness alone.

Because the case presents an important issue and was de-cided by the court below in a manner arguably at odds with
prior decisions of this Court, we granted certiorari. 499U. S. 946 (1991).

Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418 (1979), held that to com-mit an individual to a mental institution in a civil proceeding,

the State is required by the Due Process Clause to prove byclear and convincing evidence the two statutory preconditions to commitment: that the person sought to be committedis mentally ill and that he requires hospitalization for his

own welfare and protection of others. Proof beyond a rea-sonable doubt was not required, but proof by preponderance

of the evidence fell short of satisfying due process.3When a person charged with having committed a crime is
found not guilty by reason of insanity, however, a State maycommit that person without satisfying the

Addington burdenwith respect to mental illness and dangerousness. Jones v.

United States, supra. Such a verdict, we observed in Jones,"establishes two facts: (i) the defendant committed an act
that constitutes a criminal offense, and (ii) he committed theact because of mental illness," id., at 363, an illness that the
defendant adequately proved in this context by a preponder-ance of the evidence. From these two facts, it could be
properly inferred that at the time of the verdict, the defend-ant was still mentally ill and dangerous and hence could be
committed.4

3 Justice Thomas in dissent complains that Foucha should not be released based on psychiatric opinion that he is not mentally ill because
such opinion is not sufficiently precise--because psychiatry is not an exact
science and psychiatrists widely disagree on what constitutes a mental illness. That may be true, but such opinion is reliable enough to permit the
courts to base civil commitments on clear and convincing medical evidence
that a person is mentally ill and dangerous and to base release decisions
on qualified testimony that the person is no longer mentally ill or dangerous. It is also reliable enough for the State not to punish a person
who by a preponderance of the evidence is found to have been insane at
the time he committed a criminal act, to say nothing of not trying a person
who is at the time found incompetent to understand the proceedings.
And more to the point, medical predictions of dangerousness seem to be
reliable enough for Justice Thomas to permit the State to continue to
hold Foucha in a mental institution, even where the psychiatrist would say
no more than that he would hesitate to certify that Foucha would not be
dangerous to himself or others.

4 Justice Kennedy's assertion that we overrule the holding of Jones

described in the above paragraph is fanciful at best. As that paragraph
plainly shows, we do not question and fully accept that insanity acquittees
may be initially held without complying with the procedures applicable to
civil committees. As is evident from the ensuing paragraph of the text,
we are also true to the further holding of Jones that both Justice Thomas

Opinion of the Court
We held, however, that "[t]he committed acquittee is entitled to release when he has recovered his sanity or is no
longer dangerous," id., at 368; i. e., the acquittee may be held
as long as he is both mentally ill and dangerous, but no
longer. We relied on O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U. S. 563
(1975), which held as a matter of due process that it was
unconstitutional for a State to continue to confine a harmless,
mentally ill person. Even if the initial commitment was permissible, "it could not constitutionally continue after that
basis no longer existed." Id., at 575. In the summary of
our holdings in our opinion we stated that "the Constitution
permits the Government, on the basis of the insanity judgand Justice Kennedy reject: that the period of time during which an
insanity acquittee may be held in a mental institution is not measured by
the length of a sentence that might have been imposed had he been convicted; rather, the acquittee may be held until he is either not mentally ill
or not dangerous. Both Justices would permit the indefinite detention of
the acquittee, although the State concedes that he is not mentally ill and
although the doctors at the mental institution recommend his release, for
no reason other than that a psychiatrist hesitates to certify that the acquittee would not be dangerous to himself or others.

Justice Kennedy asserts that we should not entertain the proposition
that a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity differs from a conviction.
Post, at 94. Jones, however, involved a case where the accused had been
"found, beyond a reasonable doubt, to have committed a criminal act."
463 U. S., at 364. We did not find this sufficient to negate any difference
between a conviction and an insanity acquittal. Rather, we observed that
a person convicted of crime may of course be punished. But "[d]ifferent
considerations underlie commitment of an insanity acquittee. As he was
not convicted, he may not be punished." Id., at 369.

Justice Kennedy observes that proof beyond reasonable doubt of the
commission of a criminal act permits a State to incarcerate and hold the
offender on any reasonable basis. There is no doubt that the States have
wide discretion in determining punishment for convicted offenders, but
the Eighth Amendment ensures that discretion is not unlimited. The Justice cites no authority, but surely would have if it existed, for the proposition that a defendant convicted of a crime and sentenced to a term of years
may nevertheless be held indefinitely because of the likelihood that he will
commit other crimes.

ment, to confine him to a mental institution until such timeas he has regained his sanity or is no longer a danger to

himself or society." Jones, 463 U. S., at 368, 370.5 Thecourt below was in error in characterizing the above language from Jones as merely an interpretation of the perti-nent statutory law in the District of Columbia and as having
no constitutional significance. In this case, Louisiana doesnot contend that Foucha was mentally ill at the time of the
trial court's hearing. Thus, the basis for holding Foucha ina psychiatric facility as an insanity acquittee has disappeared, and the State is no longer entitled to hold him onthat basis.

O'Connor, supra, at 574-575.The State, however, seeks to perpetuate Foucha's confinement at Feliciana on the basis of his antisocial personalitywhich, as evidenced by his conduct at the facility, the court
found rendered him a danger to himself or others. There
are at least three difficulties with this position. First, evenif his continued confinement were constitutionally permissible, keeping Foucha against his will in a mental institutionis improper absent a determination in civil commitment
proceedings of current mental illness and dangerousness. In
Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S. 480 (1980), we held that a convictedfelon serving his sentence has a liberty interest, not extinguished by his confinement as a criminal, in not being trans-ferred to a mental institution and hence classified as men5 Justice Thomas, dissenting, suggests that there was no issue of the
standards for release before us in Jones. The issue in that case, however,
was whether an insanity acquittee "must be released because he has been
hospitalized for a period longer than he might have served in prison had
he been convicted," 463 U. S., at 356; and in the course of deciding that
issue in the negative, we said that the detainee could be held until he was
no longer mentally ill or no longer dangerous, regardless of how long a
prison sentence might have been. We noted in footnote 11 that Jones
had not sought a release based on nonillness or nondangerousness, but as
indicated in the text, we twice announced the outside limits on the detention of insanity acquittees. The Justice would "wish" away this aspect of
Jones, but that case merely reflected the essence of our prior decisions.

tally ill without appropriate procedures to prove that he was
mentally ill. "The loss of liberty produced by an involuntary commitment is more than a loss of freedom from
confinement." Id., at 492. Due process requires that the
nature of commitment bear some reasonable relation to
the purpose for which the individual is committed. Jones,
supra, at 368; Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U. S. 715, 738 (1972).
Here, according to the testimony given at the hearing in the
trial court, Foucha is not suffering from a mental disease or
illness. If he is to be held, he should not be held as a mentally ill person. See Jones, supra, at 368; Jackson, supra,
at 738. Cf. United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 747-748
(1987); Schall v. Martin, 467 U. S. 253, 270 (1984).

Second, if Foucha can no longer be held as an insanity acquittee in a mental hospital, he is entitled to constitutionally
adequate procedures to establish the grounds for his confinement. Jackson v. Indiana, supra, indicates as much.
There, a person under criminal charges was found incompetent to stand trial and was committed until he regained his
sanity. It was later determined that nothing could be done
to cure the detainee, who was a deaf mute. The state courts
refused to order his release. We reversed, holding that the
State was entitled to hold a person for being incompetent to
stand trial only long enough to determine if he could be
cured and become competent. If he was to be held longer,
the State was required to afford the protections constitutionally required in a civil commitment proceeding. We noted,
relying on Baxstrom v. Herold, 383 U. S. 107 (1966), that a
convicted criminal who allegedly was mentally ill was entitled to release at the end of his term unless the State committed him in a civil proceeding. " `[T]here is no conceivable
basis for distinguishing the commitment of a person who is
nearing the end of a penal term from all other civil commitments.' " Jackson v. Indiana, supra, at 724, quoting Baxstrom, supra, at 111-112.

clear that commitment for any purpose constitutes a signifi-cant deprivation of liberty that requires due process protection." Jones, supra, at 361 (internal quotation marks omitted). We have always been careful not to "minimize the
importance and fundamental nature" of the individual's right
to liberty. Salerno, supra, at 750.

A State, pursuant to its police power, may of course imprison convicted criminals for the purposes of deterrence and
retribution. But there are constitutional limitations on the
conduct that a State may criminalize. See, e. g., Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444 (1969); Robinson v. California,
370 U. S. 660 (1962). Here, the State has no such punitive
interest. As Foucha was not convicted, he may not be punished. Jones, supra, at 369. Here, Louisiana has by reason
of his acquittal exempted Foucha from criminal responsibility as La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 14:14 (West 1986) requires. See
n. 1, supra.

The State may also confine a mentally ill person if it shows
"by clear and convincing evidence that the individual is mentally ill and dangerous," Jones, 463 U. S., at 362. Here, the
State has not carried that burden; indeed, the State does not
claim that Foucha is now mentally ill.

We have also held that in certain narrow circumstances
persons who pose a danger to others or to the community
may be subject to limited confinement and it is on these
cases, particularly United States v. Salerno, supra, that the
State relies in this case.

Opinion of the Court
Salerno, unlike this case, involved pretrial detention. Weobserved in

Salerno that the "government's interest in preventing crime by arrestees is both legitimate and compel-ling,"

id., at 749, and that the statute involved there was a
constitutional implementation of that interest. The statute
carefully limited the circumstances under which detentioncould be sought to those involving the most serious of crimes

(crimes of violence, offenses punishable by life imprisonmentor death, serious drug offenses, or certain repeat offenders),
id., at 747, and was narrowly focused on a particularly acuteproblem in which the government interests are overwhelming, id., at 750. In addition to first demonstrating probable
cause, the Government was required, in a "full-blown adversary hearing," to convince a neutral decisionmaker by clear
and convincing evidence that no conditions of release can reasonably assure the safety of the community or any person,
i. e., that the "arrestee presents an identified and articulable
threat to an individual or the community." Id., at 751. Furthermore, the duration of confinement under the Bail Reform
Act of 1984 (Act) was strictly limited. The arrestee was
entitled to a prompt detention hearing and the maximum
length of pretrial detention was limited by the "stringent
time limitations of the Speedy Trial Act." Id., at 747. If
the arrestee were convicted, he would be confined as a criminal proved guilty; if he were acquitted, he would go free.
Moreover, the Act required that detainees be housed, to the
extent practicable, in a facility separate from persons awaiting or serving sentences or awaiting appeal. Id., at 747-748.

Salerno does not save Louisiana's detention of insanity acquittees who are no longer mentally ill. Unlike the sharply
focused scheme at issue in Salerno, the Louisiana scheme of
confinement is not carefully limited. Under the state statute, Foucha is not now entitled to an adversary hearing at
which the State must prove by clear and convincing evidence
that he is demonstrably dangerous to the community. Indeed, the State need prove nothing to justify continued de504US1$69D 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT
82 FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA

Opinion of the Court
tention, for the statute places the burden on the detainee toprove that he is not dangerous. At the hearing which ended

with Foucha's recommittal, no doctor or any other persontestified positively that in his opinion Foucha would be a danger to the community, let alone gave the basis for such an
opinion. There was only a description of Foucha's behaviorat Feliciana and his antisocial personality, along with a refusal to certify that he would not be dangerous. When di-rectly asked whether Foucha would be dangerous, Dr. Ritter
said only, "I don't think I would feel comfortable in certifyingthat he would not be a danger to himself or to other people."
App. 18. This, under the Louisiana statute, was enough to
defeat Foucha's interest in physical liberty. It is not enough
to defeat Foucha's liberty interest under the Constitution in
being freed from indefinite confinement in a mental facility.

Furthermore, if Foucha committed criminal acts while at
Feliciana, such as assault, the State does not explain why its
interest would not be vindicated by the ordinary criminal
processes involving charge and conviction, the use of enhanced sentences for recidivists, and other permissible ways
of dealing with patterns of criminal conduct. These are the
normal means of dealing with persistent criminal conduct.
Had they been employed against Foucha when he assaulted
other inmates, there is little doubt that if then sane he could
have been convicted and incarcerated in the usual way.

It was emphasized in Salerno that the detention we found
constitutionally permissible was strictly limited in duration.
481 U. S., at 747; see also Schall, 467 U. S., at 269. Here, in
contrast, the State asserts that because Foucha once committed a criminal act and now has an antisocial personality
that sometimes leads to aggressive conduct, a disorder for
which there is no effective treatment, he may be held indefinitely. This rationale would permit the State to hold indefinitely any other insanity acquittee not mentally ill who
could be shown to have a personality disorder that may lead
to criminal conduct. The same would be true of any con504US1$69D 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
victed criminal, even though he has completed his prisonterm. It would also be only a step away from substituting confinements for dangerousness for our present systemwhich, with only narrow exceptions and aside from permissible confinements for mental illness, incarcerates only thosewho are proved beyond reasonable doubt to have violated a
criminal law."In our society liberty is the norm, and detention prior
to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception."
United States v. Salerno, supra, at 755. The narrowly fo-cused pretrial detention of arrestees permitted by the Bail

Reform Act was found to be one of those carefully limitedexceptions permitted by the Due Process Clause. We decline to take a similar view of a law like Louisiana's, whichpermits the indefinite detention of insanity acquittees who
are not mentally ill but who do not prove they would not bedangerous to others.

6 Justice Thomas' dissent firmly embraces the view that the State may
indefinitely hold an insanity acquittee who is found by a court to have
been cured of his mental illness and who is unable to prove that he would
not be dangerous. This would be so even though, as in this case, the
court's finding of dangerousness is based solely on the detainee's antisocial
personality that apparently has caused him to engage in altercations from
time to time. Justice Thomas, however, does not challenge the holding
of our cases that a convicted criminal may not be held as a mentally ill
person without following the requirements for civil commitment, which
would not permit further detention based on dangerousness alone. Yet it
is surely strange to release sane but very likely dangerous persons who
have committed a crime knowing precisely what they were doing but continue to hold indefinitely an insanity detainee who committed a criminal
act at a time when, as found by a court, he did not know right from wrong.
Justice Thomas' rationale for continuing to hold the insanity acquittee
would surely justify treating the convicted felon in the same way, and if
put to it, it appears that he would permit it. But as indicated in the text,
this is not consistent with our present system of justice.

Justice Thomas relies heavily on the American Law Institute's (ALI)
Model Penal Code and Commentary. However, his reliance on the Model
Code is misplaced and his quotation from the Commentary is importantly
incomplete. Justice Thomas argues that the Louisiana statute follows

84 FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA

Opinion of White, J.

III
It should be apparent from what has been said earlier inthis opinion that the Louisiana statute also discriminates

"the current provisions" of the Model Penal Code, but he fails to mention
that $ 4.08 is "current" only in the sense that the Model Code has not been
amended since its approval in 1962, and therefore fails to incorporate or
reflect substantial developments in the relevant decisional law during the
intervening three decades. Thus, although this is nowhere noted in the
dissent, the Explanatory Notes expressly concede that related and similarly "current" provisions of Article 4 are unconstitutional. See, e. g.,
ALI, Model Penal Code $ 4.06(2), Explanatory Note (1985) (noting that

$ 4.06(2), permitting indefinite commitment of a mentally incompetent defendant without the finding required for civil commitment, is unconstitutional in light of Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U. S. 715 (1972), and other decisions of this Court). Nor indeed does Justice Thomas advert to the 1985
Explanatory Note to $ 4.08 itself, even though that note directly questions
the constitutionality of the provision that he so heavily relies on; it acknowledges, as Justice Thomas does not, that "it is now questionable
whether a state may use the single criterion of dangerousness to grant
discharge if it employs a different standard for release of persons civilly
committed." Justice Thomas also recites from the Commentary regarding $ 4.08. However, the introductory passage that Justice Thomas
quotes prefaces a more important passage that he omits. After explaining the rationale for the questionable provision, the Commentary states:
"Constitutional doubts . . . exist about the criterion of dangerousness. If
a person committed civilly must be released when he is no longer suffering
mental illness, it is questionable whether a person acquitted on grounds
of mental disease or defect excluding responsibility can be kept in custody
solely on the ground that he continues to be dangerous." Id., $ 4.08, Comment 3, p. 260. Thus, while Justice Thomas argues that the Louisiana
statute is not a relic of a bygone age, his principal support for this assertion is a 30-year-old provision of the Model Penal Code whose constitutionality has since been openly questioned by the ALI reporters themselves.

Similarly unpersuasive is Justice Thomas' claim regarding the number
of States that allow confinement based on dangerousness alone. First,
this assertion carries with it an obvious but unacknowledged corollary--
the vast majority of States do not allow confinement based on dangerousness alone. Second, Justice Thomas' description of these state statutes
also is importantly incomplete. Even as he argues that a scheme of confinement based on dangerousness alone is not a relic of a bygone age,
Justice Thomas neglects to mention that two of the statutes he relies

Opinion of White, J.
against Foucha in violation of the Equal Protection Clauseof the Fourteenth Amendment.

Jones established that insanity acquittees may be treated differently in some respectsfrom those persons subject to civil commitment, but Foucha,

who is not now thought to be insane, can no longer be so
classified. The State nonetheless insists on holding him in-definitely because he at one time committed a criminal act

and does not now prove he is not dangerous. Louisiana law,however, does not provide for similar confinement for other
classes of persons who have committed criminal acts and whocannot later prove they would not be dangerous. Criminals
who have completed their prison terms, or are about to doso, are an obvious and large category of such persons. Many
of them will likely suffer from the same sort of personality
disorder that Foucha exhibits. However, state law does notallow for their continuing confinement based merely on dangerousness. Instead, the State controls the behavior of
these similarly situated citizens by relying on other means,
such as punishment, deterrence, and supervised release.

on have been amended, as Justice O'Connor notes. Nor does Justice
Thomas acknowledge that at least two of the other statutes he lists as
permitting confinement based on dangerousness alone have been given a
contrary construction by highest state courts, which have found that the
interpretation for which Justice Thomas cites them would be impermissible. See State v. Fields, 77 N. J. 282, 390 A. 2d 574 (1978); In re Lewis,
403 A. 2d 1115, 1121 (Del. 1979), quoting Mills v. State, 256 A. 2d 752, 757,

n. 4 (Del. 1969) ("By necessary implication, the danger referred to must
be construed to relate to mental illness for the reason that dangerousness
without mental illness could not be a valid basis for indeterminate confinement in the State hospital"). See also ALI, Model Penal Code, supra,
at 260 (although provisions may on their face allow for confinement based
on dangerousness alone, in virtually all actual cases the questions of dangerousness and continued mental disease are likely to be closely linked).
As the widespread rejection of the standard for confinement that Justice
Thomas and Justice Kennedy argue for demonstrates, States are able
to protect both the safety of the public and the rights of the accused without challenging foundational principles of American criminal justice and
constitutional law.

86 FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Freedom from physical restraint being a fundamental right,the State must have a particularly convincing reason, which

it has not put forward, for such discrimination against insan-ity acquittees who are no longer mentally ill.

Furthermore, in civil commitment proceedings the State
must establish the grounds of insanity and dangerousnesspermitting confinement by clear and convincing evidence.

Addington, 441 U. S., at 425-433. Similarly, the State mustestablish insanity and dangerousness by clear and convincing
evidence in order to confine an insane convict beyond hiscriminal sentence, when the basis for his original confinement no longer exists. See Jackson, 406 U. S., at 724; Baxstrom, 383 U. S., at 111-112. Cf. Humphrey v. Cady, 405
U. S. 504, 510-511 (1972). However, the State now claims
that it may continue to confine Foucha, who is not now considered to be mentally ill, solely because he is deemed dangerous, but without assuming the burden of proving even
this ground for confinement by clear and convincing evidence. The court below gave no convincing reason why
the procedural safeguards against unwarranted confinement
which are guaranteed to insane persons and those who have
been convicted may be denied to a sane acquittee, and the
State has done no better in this Court.

For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the Louisiana
Supreme Court is reversed.

So ordered.

Justice O'Connor, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.

Louisiana asserts that it may indefinitely confine Terry
Foucha in a mental facility because, although not mentally
ill, he might be dangerous to himself or to others if released.
For the reasons given in Part II of the Court's opinion, this
contention should be rejected. I write separately, however,
to emphasize that the Court's opinion addresses only the specific statutory scheme before us, which broadly permits in504US1$69J 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT

87Cite as: 504 U. S. 71 (1992)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
definite confinement of sane insanity acquittees in psychiat-ric facilities. This case does not require us to pass judgment

on more narrowly drawn laws that provide for detention ofinsanity acquittees, or on statutes that provide for punishment of persons who commit crimes while mentally ill.

I do not understand the Court to hold that Louisiana maynever confine dangerous insanity acquittees after they regain

mental health. Under Louisiana law, defendants who carrythe burden of proving insanity by a preponderance of the
evidence will "escape punishment," but this affirmative de-fense becomes relevant only after the prosecution establishes
beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed
criminal acts with the required level of criminal intent.
State v. Marmillion, 339 So. 2d 788, 796 (La. 1976). Although insanity acquittees may not be incarcerated as criminals or penalized for asserting the insanity defense, see
Jones v. United States, 463 U. S. 354, 368-369, and n. 18
(1983), this finding of criminal conduct sets them apart from
ordinary citizens.

We noted in Jones that a judicial determination of criminal
conduct provides "concrete evidence" of dangerousness. Id.,
at 364. By contrast, " `[t]he only certain thing that can be
said about the present state of knowledge and therapy regarding mental disease is that science has not reached finality of judgment . . . .' " Id., at 365, n. 13 (quoting Greenwood
v. United States, 350 U. S. 366, 375 (1956)). Given this uncertainty, "courts should pay particular deference to reasonable legislative judgments" about the relationship between
dangerous behavior and mental illness. Jones, supra, at
365, n. 13. Louisiana evidently has determined that the inference of dangerousness drawn from a verdict of not guilty
by reason of insanity continues even after a clinical finding
of sanity, and that judgment merits judicial deference.

It might therefore be permissible for Louisiana to confine
an insanity acquittee who has regained sanity if, unlike the
situation in this case, the nature and duration of detention

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
were tailored to reflect pressing public safety concernsrelated to the acquittee's continuing dangerousness. See

United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 747-751 (1987);
Schall v. Martin, 467 U. S. 253, 264-271 (1984); Jackson v.
Indiana, 406 U. S. 715, 738 (1972). Although the dissenters
apparently disagree, see post, at 100 (opinion of Kennedy,
J.); post, at 125 (opinion of Thomas, J.), I think it clear that
acquittees could not be confined as mental patients absentsome medical justification for doing so; in such a case the

necessary connection between the nature and purposes ofconfinement would be absent. See

Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S.
480, 491-494 (1980) (discussing infringements upon liberty
unique to commitment to a mental hospital); Jones, supra, at
384-385 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (same). Nor would it be
permissible to treat all acquittees alike, without regard for
their particular crimes. For example, the strong interest in
liberty of a person acquitted by reason of insanity but later
found sane might well outweigh the governmental interest
in detention where the only evidence of dangerousness is
that the acquittee committed a nonviolent or relatively minor
crime. Cf. Salerno, supra, at 750 (interest in pretrial detention is "overwhelming" where only individuals arrested for
"a specific category of extremely serious offenses" are detained and "Congress specifically found that these individuals are far more likely to be responsible for dangerous acts
in the community after arrest"). Equal protection principles may set additional limits on the confinement of sane but
dangerous acquittees. Although I think it unnecessary to
reach equal protection issues on the facts before us, the permissibility of holding an acquittee who is not mentally ill
longer than a person convicted of the same crimes could be
imprisoned is open to serious question.

The second point to be made about the Court's holding is
that it places no new restriction on the States' freedom to
determine whether, and to what extent, mental illness
should excuse criminal behavior. The Court does not indi504US1$69J 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT

89Cite as: 504 U. S. 71 (1992)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
cate that States must make the insanity defense available.See Idaho Code $ 18-207(a) (1987) (mental condition not a

defense to criminal charges); Mont. Code Ann. $ 46-14-102(1991) (evidence of mental illness admissible to prove absence
of state of mind that is an element of the offense). It likewise casts no doubt on laws providing for prison terms afterverdicts of "guilty but mentally ill." See,

e. g., Del. Code
Ann., Tit. 11, $ 408(b) (1987); Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, || 1005-2-6(1989); Ind. Code $ 35-36-2-5 (Supp. 1991). If a State concludes that mental illness is best considered in the contextof criminal sentencing, the holding of this case erects no bar
to implementing that judgment.

Finally, it should be noted that the great majority of
States have adopted policies consistent with the Court's
holding. Justice Thomas claims that 11 States have laws
comparable to Louisiana's, see post, at 112-113, n. 9, but even
this number overstates the case. Two of the States Justice
Thomas mentions have already amended their laws to provide for the release of acquittees who do not suffer from mental illness but may be dangerous. See Cal. Penal Code Ann.

$ 1026.2 (West Supp. 1992) (effective Jan. 1, 1994); Va. Code
Ann. $ 19.2-182.5 (Supp. 1991) (effective July 1, 1992).
Three others limit the maximum duration of criminal commitment to reflect the acquittee's specific crimes and hold
acquittees in facilities appropriate to their mental condition.
See N. J. Stat. Ann. $$ 2C:4-8(b)(3) (West 1982), 30:4-24.2
(West 1981); Wash. Rev. Code $$ 10.77.020(3), 10.77.110(1)
(1990); Wis. Stat. $$ 971.17(1), (3)(c) (Supp. 1991). I do not
understand the Court's opinion to render such laws necessarily invalid.

Of the remaining six States, two do not condition commitment upon proof of every element of a crime. Kan. Stat.
Ann. $ 22-3428(1) (Supp. 1990) ("A finding of not guilty by
reason of insanity shall constitute a finding that the acquitted
person committed an act constituting the offense charged
. . . , except that the person did not possess the requisite

90 FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA

Kennedy, J., dissenting
criminal intent"); Mont. Code Ann. $ 46-14-301(1) (1991)(allowing commitment of persons "found not guilty for the

reason that due to a mental disease or defect the defendantcould not have a particular state of mind that is an essential
element of the offense charged"). Such laws might well fail
even under the dissenters' theories. See post, at 91-94 (Kennedy, J., dissenting); post, at 103 (Thomas, J., dissenting).

Today's holding follows directly from our precedents andleaves the States appropriate latitude to care for insanity

acquittees in a way consistent with public welfare. Accord-ingly, I concur in Parts I and II of the Court's opinion and
in the judgment of the Court.

Justice Kennedy, with whom The Chief Justice
joins, dissenting.

As incarceration of persons is the most common and one
of the most feared instruments of state oppression and state
indifference, we ought to acknowledge at the outset that
freedom from this restraint is essential to the basic definition
of liberty in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the
Constitution. I agree with the Court's reaffirmation of this
first premise. But I submit with all respect that the majority errs in its failure to recognize that the conditions for incarceration imposed by the State in this case are in accord
with legitimate and traditional state interests, vindicated
after full and fair procedures. The error results from the
majority's primary reliance on cases, such as O'Connor v.
Donaldson, 422 U. S. 563 (1975), and Addington v. Texas,
441 U. S. 418 (1979), which define the due process limits for
involuntary civil commitment. The majority relies on these
civil cases while overruling without mention one of the holdings of our most recent and significant precedent from the
criminal context, Jones v. United States, 463 U. S. 354 (1983).

This is a criminal case. It began one day when petitioner,
brandishing a .357 revolver, entered the home of a married
couple, intending to steal. Brief for Respondent 1. He

Kennedy, J., dissenting
chased them out of their home and fired on police officerswho confronted him as he fled. Id., at 1-2. Petitioner was

apprehended and charged with aggravated burglary and theillegal use of a weapon in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann.

$$ 14:60 and 14:94 (West 1986). 563 So. 2d 1138, 1138-1139(La. 1990). There is no question that petitioner committed
the criminal acts charged. Petitioner's response was todeny criminal responsibility based on his mental illness when
he committed the acts. He contended his mental illness pre-vented him from distinguishing between right and wrong
with regard to the conduct in question.Mental illness may bear upon criminal responsibility, as a
general rule, in either of two ways: First, it may precludethe formation of mens rea, if the disturbance is so profound
that it prevents the defendant from forming the requisiteintent as defined by state law; second, it may support an
affirmative plea of legal insanity. See W. LaFave & A.Scott, Jr., 1 Substantive Criminal Law $ 4.1(b), pp. 429-430
(1986) (hereinafter LaFave & Scott). Depending on thecontent of state law, the first possibility may implicate the
State's initial burden, under In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358,364 (1970), to prove every element of the offense beyond a
reasonable doubt, while the second possibility does not.
Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 206 (1977); Lelandv. Oregon, 343 U. S. 790, 795-796 (1952).

The power of the States to determine the existence ofcriminal insanity following the establishment of the underlying offense is well established. In Leland v. Oregon, we up-held a state law that required the defendant to prove insanity beyond a reasonable doubt, observing that this burdenhad no effect on the State's initial burden to prove every
element of the underlying criminal offense.

"[T]he burden of proof of guilt, and of all the necessaryelements of guilt, was placed squarely upon the State.

As the jury was told, this burden did not shift, butrested upon the State throughout the trial, just as, ac504US1$69L 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT
92 FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA

Kennedy, J., dissenting
cording to the instructions, appellant was presumed tobe innocent until the jury was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty. The jurors were toconsider separately the issue of legal sanity

per se--an
issue set apart from the crime charged, to be introduced
by a special plea and decided by a special verdict." Id.,at 795-796 (footnotes omitted).

As then-Justice Rehnquist explained the reasoning of Leland, "the existence or nonexistence of legal insanity bearsno necessary relationship to the existence or nonexistence of

the required mental elements of the crime." Mullaney v.
Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 706 (1975) (concurring opinion); seealso

Patterson v. New York, supra, at 206 (defense of insanity
considered only after the facts constituting the crime havebeen proved beyond a reasonable doubt);

Rivera v. Delaware, 429 U. S. 877 (1976) (dismissing challenge to a Lelandinstruction for want of a substantial federal question).

Louisiana law follows the pattern in Leland with clarityand precision. Pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art.
552 (West 1981), the petitioner entered a dual plea of not
guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. The dual plea,which the majority does not discuss or even mention, ensures

that the Winship burden remains on the State to prove allthe elements of the crime. The Louisiana Supreme Court
confirms this in a recent case approving the following juryinstruction on the defense of insanity:

" `In this case the accused has entered a dual plea ofnot guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. As a
consequence of such a plea, you must first determine
whether or not the accused committed a crime [on which
you have been instructed]. If you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did commit
any of these crimes, any one of these crimes, then you
must proceed to a determination of whether he was sane
at the time the crime was committed and thereby crimi504US1$69L 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT

nally responsible for committing it.' " State v. Marmil-lion, 339 So. 2d 788, 796 (1976).

The State's burden is unaffected by an adjudication withouttrial, such as occurred here, because state law requires
the trial court to determine, before accepting the plea, thatthere is a factual basis for it. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.,
Art. 558.1 (West Supp. 1992). There is no dispute that thetrial court complied with state law and made the requisite
findings.Compliance with the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is the defining, central feature in criminal adjudi-cation, unique to the criminal law.

Addington, 441 U. S., at428. Its effect is at once both symbolic and practical, as a

statement of values about respect and confidence in the crim-inal law, Winship, 397 U. S., at 364, and an apportionment

of risk in favor of the accused, id., at 369-372 (Harlan, J.,concurring). We have often subjected to heightened due
process scrutiny, with regard to both purpose and duration,deprivations of physical liberty imposed before a judgment
is rendered under this standard. See, e. g., United States v.
Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 750-751 (1987); Jackson v. Indiana,406 U. S. 715, 738 (1972); cf. Jones v. United States, 463 U. S.,

at 363-364, and n. 12 ("The proof beyond a reasonable doubtthat the acquittee committed a criminal act distinguishes this
case from Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U. S. 715 (1972) . . . . In
Jackson there never was any affirmative proof that the ac-cused had committed criminal acts . . ."). The same heightened due process scrutiny does not obtain, though, once theState has met its burden of proof and obtained an adjudication. It is well settled that upon compliance with In re
Winship, the State may incarcerate on any reasonable basis.Chapman v. United States, 500 U. S. 453, 465 (1991); Williams v. Illinois, 399 U. S. 235, 243 (1970).As

Justice Thomas observes in his dissent, the majorityerrs by attaching "talismanic significance" to the fact that

petitioner has been adjudicated "not guilty by reason of in504US1$69L 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT

sanity." Post, at 118, n. 13. A verdict of not guilty by reasonof insanity is neither equivalent nor comparable to a verdict

of not guilty standing alone. We would not allow a State toevade its burden of proof by replacing its criminal law with
a civil system in which there is no presumption of innocence
and the defendant has the burden of proof. Nor should weentertain the proposition that this case differs from a conviction of guilty because petitioner has been adjudged "notguilty by reason of insanity," rather than "guilty but insane."
Petitioner has suggested no grounds on which to distinguishthe liberty interests involved or procedural protections afforded as a consequence of the State's ultimate choice of nomenclature. The due process implications ought not to vary
under these circumstances. This is a criminal case in which
the State has complied with the rigorous demands of In re
Winship.

The majority's failure to recognize the criminal character
of these proceedings and its concomitant standards of proof
leads it to conflate the standards for civil and criminal commitment in a manner not permitted by our precedents.
O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U. S. 563 (1975), and Addington
v. Texas, supra, define the due process limits of involuntary
civil commitment. Together they stand for the proposition
that in civil proceedings the Due Process Clause requires the
State to prove both insanity and dangerousness by clear and
convincing evidence. See O'Connor, supra, at 575; Addington, supra, at 433. Their precedential value in the civil context is beyond question. But it is an error to apply these
precedents, as the majority does today, to criminal proceedings. By treating this criminal case as a civil one, the majority overrules a principal holding in Jones v. United States,
463 U. S., at 354.

In Jones we considered the system of criminal commitment enacted by Congress for the District of Columbia. Id.,
at 356-358. Congress provided for acquittal by reason of
insanity only after the Government had shown, beyond a rea504US1$69L 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT

Kennedy, J., dissenting
sonable doubt, that the defendant had committed the crimescharged.

Id., at 363-364, and n. 12. In cases of acquittal
by reason of insanity, District law provided for automaticcommitment followed by periodic hearings, where the insanity acquittee was given the opportunity to prove that he was
no longer insane or dangerous. Id., at 357-358, and n. 3.Petitioner in

Jones contended that Addington and O'Connor
applied to criminal proceedings as well as civil, requiring theGovernment to prove insanity and dangerousness by clear

and convincing evidence before commitment. We rejectedthat contention. In

Jones we distinguished criminal from
civil commitment, holding that the Due Process Clause permits automatic incarceration after a criminal adjudication
and without further process. Id., at 366. The majority
today in effect overrules that holding. It holds that "keeping Foucha against his will in a mental institution is improper absent a determination in civil commitment proceedings of current mental illness and dangerousness." Ante, at
78; see also ante, at 80, 85-86. Our holding in Jones was
clear and to the contrary. We should not so disregard controlling precedent.

Our respect for the Court's opinion in Jones should be informed by the recognition that its distinction between civil
and criminal commitment is both sound and consistent with
long-established precedent. First, as described above, the
procedural protections afforded in a criminal commitment
surpass those in a civil commitment; indeed, these procedural
protections are the most stringent known to our law. Second, proof of criminal conduct in accordance with In re
Winship eliminates the risk of incarceration "for mere `idiosyncratic behavior,' [because a] criminal act by definition is
not `within a range of conduct that is generally acceptable.' "
Jones, supra, at 367, quoting Addington, supra, at 426-427.
The criminal law defines a discrete category of conduct for
which society has reserved its greatest opprobrium and
strictest sanctions; past or future dangerousness, as ascer504US1$69L 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT

tained or predicted in civil proceedings, is different in kind.Third, the State presents distinct rationales for these differing forms of commitment: In the civil context, the State actsin large part on the basis of its parens patriae power to
protect and provide for an ill individual, while in the criminalcontext, the State acts to ensure the public safety. See

Add-ington, 441 U. S., at 426; S. Brakel, J. Parry, & B. Weiner,

The Mentally Disabled and the Law 24-25 (3d ed. 1985). Adismissive footnote, see ante, at 76-77, n. 4, cannot overcome
these fundamental defects in the majority's opinion.The majority's opinion is troubling at a further level, because it fails to recognize or account for profound differencesbetween clinical insanity and state-law definitions of criminal
insanity. It is by now well established that insanity as de-fined by the criminal law has no direct analog in medicine or
science. "[T]he divergence between law and psychiatry iscaused in part by the legal fiction represented by the words
`insanity' or `insane,' which are a kind of lawyer's catchalland have no clinical meaning." J. Biggs, The Guilty Mind
117 (1955); see also 2 J. Bouvier, Law Dictionary 1590 (8thed. 1914) ("The legal and the medical ideas of insanity are
essentially different, and the difference is one of substance").Consistent with the general rule that the definition of both
crimes and defenses is a matter of state law, see Pattersonv. New York, 432 U. S., at 210, the States are free to recognize and define the insanity defense as they see fit.

"Nothing could be less fruitful than for this Court tobe impelled into defining some sort of insanity test in

constitutional terms. . . . It is simply not yet the time towrite into the Constitution formulas cast in terms whose
meaning, let alone relevance, is not yet clear either todoctors or to lawyers." Powell v. Texas, 392 U. S. 514,

536-537 (1968) (plurality opinion).
See also id., at 545 (the Constitution does not impose on theStates any particular test of criminal responsibility) (Black,

J., concurring).

As provided by Louisiana law, and consistent with bothfederal criminal law and the law of a majority of the States,

petitioner was found not guilty by reason of insanity underthe traditional

M'Naghten test. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann.

$ 14:14 (West 1986); 18 U. S. C. $ 17; M'Naghten's Case, 10
Cl. & Fin. 200, 8 Eng. Rep. 718 (1843); 1 LaFave & Scott$ 4.2, at 436. Louisiana law provides a traditional statement

of this test: "If the circumstances indicate that because of amental disease or mental defect the offender was incapable
of distinguishing between right and wrong with reference tothe conduct in question, the offender shall be exempt from
criminal responsibility." La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 14:14 (West
1986).

Because the M'Naghten test for insanity turns on a finding
of criminal irresponsibility at the time of the offense, it is
quite wrong to place reliance on the fact, as the majority
does, that Louisiana does not contend that petitioner is now
insane. See ante, at 78. This circumstance should come as
no surprise, since petitioner was competent at the time of his
plea, 563 So. 2d, at 1139, and indeed could not have entered a
plea otherwise, see Drope v. Missouri, 420 U. S. 162, 171
(1975). Present sanity would have relevance if petitioner
had been committed as a consequence of civil proceedings, in
which dangerous conduct in the past was used to predict similar conduct in the future. It has no relevance here, however. Petitioner has not been confined based on predictions
about future behavior but rather for past criminal conduct.
Unlike civil commitment proceedings, which attempt to divine the future from the past, in a criminal trial whose outcome turns on M'Naghten, findings of past insanity and past
criminal conduct possess intrinsic and ultimate significance.

The system here described is not employed in all jurisdictions. Some have supplemented the traditional M'Naghten
test with the so-called "irresistible impulse" test, see 1 LaFave & Scott $ 4.1, at 427-428; others have adopted a test
proposed as part of the Model Penal Code, see ibid.; and still

504US1$69L 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT

Kennedy, J., dissenting
others have abolished the defense altogether, see Idaho Code$ 18-207(a) (1987); Mont. Code Ann. $ 46-14-102 (1992).

Since it is well accepted that the States may define their owncrimes and defenses, see

supra, at 96, the point would not
warrant further mention, but for the fact that the majority
loses sight of it. In describing our decision in Jones, themajority relies on our statement that a verdict of not guilty

by reason of insanity establishes that the defendant " `com-mitted the act because of mental illness.' "

Ante, at 76,
quoting Jones, 463 U. S., at 363. That was an accurate state-ment in

Jones but not here. The defendant in Jones was
acquitted under the Durham test for insanity, which excludes from punishment criminal conduct that is the product
of a mental disease or defect. See Bethea v. United States,
365 A. 2d 64, 69, n. 11 (1976); see also Durham v. United
States, 94 U. S. App. D. C. 228, 240-241, 214 F. 2d 862, 874-
875 (1954). In a Durham jurisdiction, it would be fair to
say, as the Court did in Jones, that a defendant acquitted
by reason of insanity "committed the act because of mental
illness." Jones, supra, at 363. The same cannot be said
here, where insanity under M'Naghten proves only that the
defendant could not have distinguished between right and
wrong. It is no small irony that the aspect of Jones on
which the majority places greatest reliance, and indeed cites
as an example of its adherence to Jones, has no bearing on
the Louisiana statute at issue here. See ante, at 76, and
n. 4.

The establishment of a criminal act and of insanity under
the M'Naghten regime provides a legitimate basis for confinement. Although Louisiana has chosen not to punish insanity acquittees, the State has not surrendered its interest
in incapacitative incarceration. The Constitution does not
require any particular model for criminal confinement, Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 999 (1991) (Kennedy, J.,
concurring in judgment) ("The federal and state criminal
systems have accorded different weights at different times

to the penological goals of retribution, deterrence, incapaci-tation, and rehabilitation");

Williams v. New York, 337 U. S.
241, 246 (1949), and upon compliance with In re Winship, theState may incarcerate on any reasonable basis, see

supra,
at 93. Incapacitation for the protection of society is not an
unusual ground for incarceration. "[I]solation of the dan-gerous has always been considered an important function of

the criminal law," Powell v. Texas, 392 U. S. 514, 539 (1968)(Black, J., concurring), and insanity acquittees are a special
class of offenders proved dangerous beyond their own abilityto comprehend. The wisdom of incarceration under these
circumstances is demonstrated by its high level of acceptance. Every State provides for discretionary or mandatory
incarceration of insanity acquittees, 1 LaFave & Scott

$ 4.6(a), at 510, and as Justice Thomas observes in his dissent, provisions like those in Louisiana, predicated on dangerousness alone, have been endorsed by the Model Penal
Code and adopted by the legislatures of no fewer than 11
other States. See post, at 111-112, and nn. 8 and 9.

It remains to be seen whether the majority, by questioning
the legitimacy of incapacitative incarceration, puts in doubt
the confinement of persons other than insanity acquittees.
Parole release provisions often place the burden of proof on
the prisoner to prove his lack of dangerousness. To use a
familiar example, under the federal parole system in place
until the enactment of the Sentencing Guidelines, an inmate
could not be released on parole unless he established that
his "release would not jeopardize the public welfare." 18
U. S. C. $ 4206(a)(2) (1982 ed.), repealed 98 Stat. 2027; see also
28 CFR $ 2.18 (1991). This requirement reflected "the incapacitative aspect of the use of imprisonment which has the
effect of denying the opportunity for future criminality, at
least for a time." U. S. Dept. of Justice, United States Parole Commission Rules and Procedures Manual 69 (July 24,
1989). This purpose is consistent with the parole release
provisions of Alabama, Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts,

Kennedy, J., dissenting
Michigan, New York, and the District of Columbia, to name
just a few. See N. Cohen & J. Gobert, Law of Probation and
Parole $ 3.05, p. 109, and n. 103 (1983). It is difficult for me
to reconcile the rationale of incapacitative incarceration,
which underlies these regimes, with the opinion of the majority, which discounts its legitimacy.

I also have difficulty with the majority's emphasis on the
conditions of petitioner's confinement. In line with Justice
O'Connor's concurring opinion, see ante, at 87-88, the majority emphasizes the fact that petitioner has been confined in a
mental institution, see ante, at 77-78, 78-79, 82, suggesting
that his incarceration might not be unconstitutional if undertaken elsewhere. The majority offers no authority for its
suggestion, while Justice O'Connor relies on a reading of
Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S. 480 (1980), which was rejected by the
Court in Jones v. United States. See ante, at 87-88, citing
Jones v. United States, supra, at 384-385 (Brennan, J., dissenting). The petitioner did not rely on this argument at any
point in the proceedings, and we have not the authority to
make the assumption, as a matter of law, that the conditions of
petitioner's confinement are in any way infirm. Ours is not
a case, as in Vitek v. Jones, where the State has stigmatized
petitioner by placing him in a mental institution when he
should have been placed elsewhere. Jones v. United States
is explicit on this point: "A criminal defendant who successfully raises the insanity defense necessarily is stigmatized
by the verdict itself, and thus the commitment causes little
additional harm in this respect." 463 U. S., at 367, n. 16.
Nor is this a case, as in Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210
(1990), in which petitioner has suffered some further deprivation of liberty to which independent due process protections might attach. Both the fact and conditions of confinement here are attributable to petitioner's criminal
conduct and subsequent decision to plead insanity. To the
extent the majority relies on the conditions of petitioner's

confinement, its decision is without authority, and most of itsopinion is nothing more than confusing dicta.

I submit that today's decision is unwarranted and unwise.I share the Court's concerns about the risks inherent in requiring a committed person to prove what can often be imprecise, but as Justice Thomas observes in his dissent, thisis not a case in which the period of confinement exceeds the

gravity of the offense or in which there are reasons to believethe release proceedings are pointless or a sham.

Post, at
114, n. 10. Petitioner has been incarcerated for less thanone-third the statutory maximum for the offenses proved by

the State. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $$ 14:60 (aggravated burglary) and 14:94 (illegal use of a weapon) (West 1986). In
light of these facts, the majority's repeated reference to "indefinite detention," with apparent reference to the potential
duration of confinement, and not its lack of a fixed end point,
has no bearing on this case. See ante, at 77, n. 4, 82, 83,
n. 6; cf. ante, at 77, n. 4 (curious suggestion that confinement
has been extended beyond an initial term of years). It is
also significant to observe that this is not a case in which the
incarcerated subject has demonstrated his nondangerousness. Within the two months before his release hearing,
petitioner had been sent to a maximum security section of
the Feliciana Forensic Facility because of altercations with
another patient. 563 So. 2d, at 1141. Further, there is evidence in the record which suggests that petitioner's initial
claim of insanity may have been feigned. The medical panel
that reviewed petitioner's request for release stated that
"there is no evidence of mental illness," and indeed that
there was "never any evidence of mental illness or disease
since admission." App. 10. In sum, it would be difficult to
conceive of a less compelling situation for the imposition of
sweeping new constitutional commands such as the majority
imposes today.

Because the majority conflates the standards for civil and
criminal commitment, treating this criminal case as though

it were civil, it upsets a careful balance relied upon by theStates, not only in determining the conditions for continuing

confinement, but also in defining the defenses permitted for
mental incapacity at the time of the crime in question. In
my view, having adopted a traditional and well-accepted test
for determining criminal insanity, and having complied with
the rigorous demands of In re Winship, the State possesses
the constitutional authority to incarcerate petitioner for the
protection of society. I submit my respectful dissent.

Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Scalia join, dissenting.

The Louisiana statutory scheme the Court strikes down
today is not some quirky relic of a bygone age, but a codification of the current provisions of the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code. Invalidating this quite reasonable
scheme is bad enough; even worse is the Court's failure to
explain precisely what is wrong with it. In parts of its opinion, the Court suggests that the scheme is unconstitutional
because it provides for the continued confinement of insanity
acquittees who, although still dangerous, have "recovered"
their sanity. Ante, at 77 ("[T]he committed acquittee is
entitled to release when he has recovered his sanity or is no
longer dangerous") (emphasis added; internal quotation
marks omitted). In other parts of the opinion, the Court
suggests--and the concurrence states explicitly--that the
constitutional flaw with this scheme is not that it provides
for the confinement of sane insanity acquittees, but that it
(allegedly) provides for their "indefinite" confinement in a
mental facility. Ante, at 82; ante, at 86-87 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Nothing
in the Constitution, this Court's precedents, or our society's
traditions authorizes the Court to invalidate the Louisiana
scheme on either of these grounds. I would therefore affirm
the judgment of the Louisiana Supreme Court.

Thomas, J., dissenting

I
The Court errs, in large part, because it fails to examine
in detail the challenged statutory scheme and its application
in this case. Under Louisiana law, a verdict of "not guilty
by reason of insanity" differs significantly from a verdict of
"not guilty." A simple verdict of not guilty following a trial
means that the State has failed to prove all of the elements
of the charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e. g.,
State v. Messiah, 538 So. 2d 175, 180 (La. 1988) (citing In re
Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970)); cf. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.,
Art. 804(A)(1) (West 1969). A verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, in contrast, means that the defendant committed the crime, but established that he was "incapable of
distinguishing between right and wrong" with respect to his
criminal conduct. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 14:14 (West 1986).
Insanity, in other words, is an affirmative defense that does
not negate the State's proof, but merely "exempt[s the defendant] from criminal responsibility." Ibid. As the Louisiana Supreme Court has summarized: "The State's traditional burden of proof is to establish beyond a reasonable
doubt all necessary elements of the offense. Once this rigorous burden of proof has been met, it having been shown
that defendant has committed a crime, the defendant . . .
bear[s] the burden of establishing his defense of insanity

in order to escape punishment." State v. Marmillion, 339
So. 2d 788, 796 (1976) (emphasis added). See also State v.
Surrency, 88 So. 240, 244 (La. 1921).

Louisiana law provides a procedure for a judge to render
a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity upon a plea without a trial. See La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 558.1 (West
Supp. 1991). The trial court apparently relied on this procedure when it committed Foucha. See 563 So. 2d 1138, 1139,

104 FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA

Thomas, J., dissenting
n. 3 (La. 1990).1 After ordering two experts to examineFoucha, the trial court issued the following judgment:

"After considering the law and the evidence adduced
in this matter, the Court finds that the accused, Terry
Foucha, is unable to appreciate the usual, natural and
probable consequences of his acts; that he is unable to
distinguish right from wrong; that he is a menace to
himself and to others; and that he was insane at the time
of the commission of the above crimes and that he is
presently insane." App. 6.

After adjudicating a defendant not guilty by reason of
insanity, a trial court must hold a hearing on the issue of
dangerousness. The law specifies that "[i]f the court determines that the defendant cannot be released without a
danger to others or to himself, it shall order him committed
to . . . [a] mental institution." La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.,
Art. 654 (West Supp. 1991).2 " `Dangerous to others' means

1 Under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 558.1 (West Supp. 1991), a criminal defendant apparently concedes that he committed the crime, and advances his insanity as the sole ground on which to avoid conviction. Foucha does not challenge the procedures whereby he was adjudicated not
guilty by reason of insanity; nor does he deny that he committed the
crimes with which he was charged.

2 Article 654 provides in pertinent part:

"When a defendant is found not guilty by reason of insanity in any [noncapital] felony case, the court shall remand him to the parish jail or to a
private mental institution approved by the court and shall promptly hold
a contradictory hearing at which the defendant shall have the burden of
proof, to determine whether the defendant can be discharged or can be
released on probation, without danger to others or to himself. If the court
determines that the defendant cannot be released without danger to others or to himself, it shall order him committed to a proper state mental
institution or to a private mental institution approved by the court for
custody, care, and treatment. If the court determines that the defendant
can be discharged or released on probation without danger to others or to
himself, the court shall either order his discharge, or order his release on
probation subject to specified conditions for a fixed or an indeterminate
period. The court shall assign written findings of fact and conclusions of

the condition of a person whose behavior or significantthreats support a reasonable expectation that there is a substantial risk that he will inflict physical harm upon anotherperson in the near future." La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 28:2(3)
(West 1986) (emphasis added). " `Dangerous to self ' meansthe condition of a person whose behavior, significant threats
or inaction supports a reasonable expectation that there is asubstantial risk that he will inflict physical or severe emotional harm upon his own person." $ 28:2(4).After holding the requisite hearings, the trial court in this
case ordered Foucha committed to the Feliciana ForensicFacility. After his commitment, Foucha was entitled, upon
request, to another hearing six months later and at yearlyintervals after that. See La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art.
655(B) (West Supp. 1991).3 In addition, Louisiana law pro-vides that a release hearing must be held upon recommendation by the superintendent of a mental institution. See Art.655(A).

4 In early 1988, Feliciana's superintendent recomlaw; however, the assignment of reasons shall not delay the implementation of judgment."

3 Article 655(B) provides:

"A person committed pursuant to Article 654 may make application to
the review panel for discharge or for release on probation. Such application by a committed person may not be filed until the committed person
has been confined for a period of at least six months after the original
commitment. If the review panel recommends to the court that the person be discharged, conditionally or unconditionally, or placed on probation,
the court shall conduct a hearing following notice to the district attorney.
If the recommendation of the review panel or the court is adverse, the
applicant shall not be permitted to file another application until one year
has elapsed from the date of determination."

4 Article 655(A) provides:

"When the superintendent of a mental institution is of the opinion that
a person committed pursuant to Article 654 can be discharged or can be
released on probation, without danger to others or to himself, he shall
recommend the discharge or release of the person in a report to a review
panel comprised of the person's treating physician, the clinical director of
the facility to which the person is committed, and a physician or psychologist who served on the sanity commission which recommended commitment of the person. If any member of the panel is unable to serve, a

mended that Foucha be released, and a three-doctor panelmet to review the case. On March 21, 1988, the panel issued

a report pursuant to Article 656.5 The panel concluded that"there is no evidence of mental illness." App. 10. In fact,
the panel stated that there was "never any evidence of
mental illness or disease since admission." Ibid. (emphasis
added). Although the panel did not discuss whether Foucha
was dangerous, it recommended to the trial court that he be
conditionally released.

As a result of these recommendations, the trial court
scheduled a hearing to determine whether Foucha should be
released. Under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 657 (West
Supp. 1991),6 Foucha had the burden at this hearing to prove

physician or a psychologist engaged in the practice of clinical or counseling
psychology with at least three years' experience in the field of mental
health shall be appointed by the remaining members. The panel shall
review all reports received promptly. After review, the panel shall make
a recommendation to the court by which the person was committed as to
the person's mental condition and whether he can be discharged, conditionally or unconditionally, or placed on probation, without being a danger to
others or himself. If the review panel recommends to the court that the
person be discharged, conditionally or unconditionally, or placed on probation, the court shall conduct a contradictory hearing following notice to
the district attorney."

5 Article 656 provides:

"A. Upon receipt of the superintendent's report, filed in conformity with
Article 655, the review panel may examine the committed person and report, to the court promptly, whether he can be safely discharged, conditionally or unconditionally, or be safely released on probation, without danger to others or to himself.

"B. The committed person or the district attorney may also retain a
physician to examine the committed person for the same purpose. The
physician's report shall be filed with the court."

that he could be released without danger to others or to him-self. The court appointed two experts (the same doctors

who had examined Foucha at the time of his original commit-ment) to evaluate his dangerousness. These doctors concluded that Foucha "is presently in remission from mentalillness," but said that they could not "certify that he would
not constitute a menace to himself or to others if released."App. 12. On November 29, 1988, the trial court held the
hearing, at which Foucha was represented by counsel. Thecourt concluded that Foucha "is a danger to himself, and to
others," id., at 24, and ordered that he be returned toFeliciana.

to prove that he can be discharged, or can be released on probation, without danger to others or to himself. After the hearing, and upon filing
written findings of fact and conclusions of law, the court may order the
committed person discharged, released on probation subject to specified
conditions for a fixed or an indeterminate period, or recommitted to the
state mental institution. Notice to the counsel for the committed person
and the district attorney of the contradictory hearing shall be given at
least thirty days prior to the hearing."

be released without danger to others or to himself under La. Code Crim.

108 FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA

Thomas, J., dissenting
That being the case, he is entitled to the same treatment ascivil committees. "

[I]f Foucha can no longer be held as an
insanity acquittee," the Court says, "he is entitled to consti-tutionally adequate procedures [those afforded in civil commitment proceedings] to establish the grounds for his confinement." Ante, at 79 (emphasis added). This, of course,is an equal protection argument (there being no rational distinction between A and B, the State must treat them thesame); the Court does not even pretend to examine the fairness of the release procedures the State has provided.I cannot agree with the Court's conclusion because I believe that there is a real and legitimate distinction between
insanity acquittees and civil committees that justifies procedural disparities. Unlike civil committees, who have not
been found to have harmed society, insanity acquittees have
been found in a judicial proceeding to have committed a
criminal act.

That distinction provided the ratio decidendi for our most
relevant precedent, Jones v. United States, 463 U. S. 354
(1983). That case involved a man who had been automatically committed to a mental institution after being acquitted
of a crime by reason of insanity in the District of Columbia
(i. e., he had not been given the procedures afforded to civil
committees). We rejected both of his procedural due process challenges to his commitment. First, we held that an
insanity acquittal justified automatic commitment of the acquittee (even though he might presently be sane), because
Congress was entitled to decide that the verdict provided a
reasonable basis for inferring dangerousness and insanity at
the time of commitment. Id., at 366. The Government's interest in avoiding a de novo commitment hearing following
every insanity acquittal, we said, outweighed the acquittee's
interest in avoiding unjustified institutionalization. Ibid.
Second, we held that the Constitution did not require, as a
predicate for the indefinite commitment of insanity acquittees, proof of insanity by "clear and convincing" evidence, as

required for civil committees by Addington v. Texas, 441U. S. 418 (1979). There are, we recognized, "important differences between the class of potential civil-commitment can-didates and the class of insanity acquittees that justify differing standards of proof." Jones, 463 U. S., at 367. In sharpcontrast to a civil committee, an insanity acquittee is institutionalized only where "the acquittee himself advances insan-ity as a defense and proves that his criminal act was a product of his mental illness," and thus "there is good reason fordiminished concern as to the risk of error."

Ibid. (emphasisin original). "More important, the proof that he committed

a criminal act . . . eliminates the risk that he is being com-mitted for mere `idiosyncratic behavior.' "

Ibid. Thus, weconcluded, the preponderance of the evidence standard comports with due process for commitment of insanity acquit-tees. Id., at 368. "[I]nsanity acquittees constitute a special
class that should be treated differently from other candidatesfor commitment." Id., at 370.

The Court today attempts to circumvent Jones by declar-ing that a State's interest in treating insanity acquittees differently from civil committees evaporates the instant anacquittee "becomes sane." I do not agree. As an initial
matter, I believe that it is unwise, given our present under-standing of the human mind, to suggest that a determination
that a person has "regained sanity" is precise. "Psychiatryis not . . . an exact science, and psychiatrists disagree widely
and frequently on what constitutes mental illness." Ake v.Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, 81 (1985). Indeed,

"[w]e have recognized repeatedly the `uncertainty of di-agnosis in this field and the tentativeness of professional
judgment. The only certain thing that can be saidabout the present state of knowledge and therapy regarding mental disease is that science has not reachedfinality of judgment.' The lesson we have drawn is not
that government may not act in the face of this un-certainty, but rather that courts should pay particular

deference to reasonable legislative judgments." Jones,supra, at 365, n. 13 (quoting Greenwood v. United States,

350 U. S. 366, 375 (1956); citations omitted).
In this very case, the panel that evaluated Foucha in 1988concluded that there was "

never any evidence of mental ill-ness or disease since admission," App. 10; the trial court, of

course, concluded that Foucha was "presently insane," id., at6, at the time it accepted his plea and sent him to Feliciana.

The distinction between civil committees and insanity ac-quittees, after all, turns

not on considerations of present san-ity, but instead on the fact that the latter have "already unhappily manifested the reality of anti-social conduct," Dixonv. Jacobs, 138 U. S. App. D. C. 319, 334, 427 F. 2d 589, 604
(1970) (Leventhal, J., concurring). "[T]he prior anti-socialconduct of an insanity acquittee justifies treating such a person differently from ones otherwise civilly committed forpurposes of deciding whether the patient should be released." Powell v. Florida, 579 F. 2d 324, 333 (CA5 1978)(emphasis added); see also

United States v. Ecker, 177 U. S.App. D. C. 31, 50, 543 F. 2d 178, 197 (1976), cert. denied, 429

U. S. 1063 (1977). While a State may renounce a punitiveinterest by offering an insanity defense, it does not follow
that, once the acquittee's sanity is "restored," the State isrequired to ignore his criminal act, and to renounce all interest in protecting society from him. "The state has a sub-stantial interest in avoiding premature release of insanity
acquittees, who have committed acts constituting feloniesand have been declared dangerous to society."

Hickey v.Morris, 722 F. 2d 543, 548 (CA9 1983).

Furthermore, the Federal Constitution does not require aState to "ignore the danger of `calculated abuse of the insanity defense.' " Warren v. Harvey, 632 F. 2d 925, 932 (CA21980) (quoting

United States v. Brown, 155 U. S. App. D. C.402, 407, 478 F. 2d 606, 611 (1973)). A State that decides to

offer its criminal defendants an insanity defense, which thedefendant himself is given the choice of invoking, is surely

allowed to attach to that defense certain consequences thatprevent abuse. Cf. Lynch v. Overholser, 369 U. S. 705, 715

(1962) ("Congress might have considered it appropriate toprovide compulsory commitment for those who successfully
invoke an insanity defense in order to discourage false pleasof insanity").

"In effect, the defendant, by raising the defense of insan-ity--and he alone can raise it--postpones a determination of his present mental health and acknowledges theright of the state, upon accepting his plea, to detain him
for diagnosis, care, and custody in a mental institutionuntil certain specified conditions are met. . . . [C]ommitment via the criminal process . . . thus is more akinto `voluntary' than `involuntary' civil commitment."
Goldstein & Katz, Dangerousness and Mental Illness,Some Observations on the Decision to Release Persons
Acquitted by Reason of Insanity, 70 Yale L. J. 225, 230(1960) (footnote omitted).

A State may reasonably decide that the integrity of aninsanity-acquittal scheme requires the continued commitment of insanity acquittees who remain dangerous. Surely,the citizenry would not long tolerate the insanity defense if
a serial killer who convinces a jury that he is not guilty byreason of insanity is returned to the streets immediately
after trial by convincing a different factfinder that he is notin fact insane.

As the American Law Institute has explained:

"It seemed preferable to the Institute to make danger-ousness the criterion for continued custody, rather than

to provide that the committed person may be dischargedor released when restored to sanity as defined by the
mental hygiene laws. Although his mental disease mayhave greatly improved, [an insanity acquittee] may still
be dangerous because of factors in his personality andbackground other than mental disease. Also, such a

who successfully feigned mental disease to gain anacquittal." Model Penal Code $ 4.08, Comment 3,
pp. 259-260 (1985).8
That this is a reasonable legislative judgment is underscoredby the fact that it has been made by no fewer than 11 state

legislatures, in addition to Louisiana's, which expressly pro-vide that insanity acquittees shall not be released as long as
they are dangerous, regardless of sanity.9

8 The relevant provision of the Model Penal Code, strikingly similar to
Article 657 of the Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure, see supra, n. 6,
provides in part as follows:

"If the Court is satisfied by the report filed pursuant to Subsection (2) of
this Section and such testimony of the reporting psychiatrists as the Court
deems necessary that the committed person may be discharged or released
on condition without danger to himself or others, the Court shall order his
discharge or his release on such conditions as the Court determines to be
necessary. If the Court is not so satisfied, it shall promptly order a hearing to determine whether such person may safely be discharged or released. Any such hearing shall be deemed a civil proceeding and the burden shall be upon the committed person to prove that he may safely be
discharged or released." Model Penal Code $ 4.08(3) (Proposed Official
Draft 1962).

9 See Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 1026.2(e) (West Supp. 1992) (insanity acquittee not entitled to release until court determines that he "will not be a
danger to the health and safety of others, including himself"); Del. Code
Ann., Tit. 11, $ 403(b) (1987) (insanity acquittee shall be kept institutionalized until court "is satisfied that the public safety will not be endangered
by his release"); Haw. Rev. Stat. $ 704-415 (1985) (insanity acquittee not

The Court suggests an alternative "procedural" due proc-ess theory that is, if anything, even less persuasive than its

principal theory. "[K]eeping Foucha against his will in amental institution is improper absent a determination in
civil commitment proceedings of current mental illness anddangerousness."

Ante, at 78 (emphasis added). The Courtcites Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S. 480 (1980), as support. There

are two problems with this theory. First, it is illogical: Lou-isiana cannot possibly extend Foucha's incarceration by adding the procedures afforded to civil committees, since it isimpossible to civilly commit someone who is not presently

to others of serious property damage if conditionally released").

The Court and the concurrence dispute this list of statutes. Ante, at
84-85, n. 6; ante, at 89 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment). They note that two of the States have enacted new laws,
not yet effective, modifying their current absolute prohibitions on the release of dangerous insanity acquittees; that courts in two other States
have apparently held that mental illness is a prerequisite to confinement;
and that three of the States place caps of some sort on the duration of the
confinement of insanity acquittees. Those criticisms miss my point. I
cite the 11 state statutes above only to show that the legislative judgments
underlying Louisiana's scheme are far from unique or freakish, and that
there is no well-established practice in our society, either past or present,
of automatically releasing sane-but-dangerous insanity acquittees.

Thomas, J., dissenting
mentally ill. Second, the theory is not supported by Vitek.Stigmatization (our concern in Vitek) is simply not a relevant

consideration where insanity acquittees are involved. Aswe explained in Jones: "A criminal defendant who successfully raises the insanity defense necessarily is stigmatizedby the verdict itself, and thus the commitment causes little
additional harm in this respect." 463 U. S., at 367, n. 16; seealso

Warren v. Harvey, 632 F. 2d, at 931-932. (This is insharp contrast to situations involving civil committees. See

Addington, 441 U. S., at 425-426; Vitek, supra, at 492-494.)It is implausible, in my view, that a person who chooses to
plead not guilty by reason of insanity and then spends sev-eral years in a mental institution becomes unconstitutionally
stigmatized by continued confinement in the institution after"regaining" sanity.

In my view, there was no procedural due process violationin this case. Articles 654, 655, and 657 of the Louisiana
Code of Criminal Procedure, as noted above, afford insanityacquittees the opportunity to obtain release by demonstrating at regular intervals that they no longer pose a threat tosociety. These provisions also afford judicial review of such
determinations. Pursuant to these procedures, and basedupon testimony of experts, the Louisiana courts determined
not to release Foucha at this time because the evidence didnot show that he ceased to be dangerous. Throughout these
proceedings, Foucha was represented by state-appointedcounsel. I see no plausible argument that these procedures
denied Foucha a fair hearing on the issue involved or thatFoucha needed additional procedural protections.

10 See

Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319 (1976); Patterson v. NewYork, 432 U. S. 197 (1977); cf. Addington, supra, at 427-432;

10 Foucha has not argued that the State's procedures, as applied, are a
sham. This would be a different case if Foucha had established that the
statutory mechanisms for release were nothing more than window
dressing, and that the State in fact confined insanity acquittees indefinitely
without meaningful opportunity for review and release.

B
The Court next concludes that Louisiana's statutoryscheme must fall because it violates Foucha's substantive

due process rights. Ante, at 80-83, and n. 6. I disagree.Until today, I had thought that the analytical framework for
evaluating substantive due process claims was relativelystraightforward. Certain substantive rights we have recognized as "fundamental"; legislation trenching upon these issubjected to "strict scrutiny," and generally will be invalidated unless the State demonstrates a compelling interestand narrow tailoring. Such searching judicial review of
state legislation, however, is the exception, not the rule, inour democratic and federal system; we have consistently emphasized that "the Court has no license to invalidate legisla-tion which it thinks merely arbitrary or unreasonable." Regents of University of Michigan v. Ewing, 474 U. S. 214, 226(1985) (internal quotation marks omitted). Except in the
unusual case where a fundamental right is infringed, then,federal judicial scrutiny of the substance of state legislation
under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendmentis not exacting. See,

e. g., Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S.186, 191-196 (1986).

In striking down Louisiana's scheme as a violation of sub-stantive rights guaranteed by the Due Process Clause, the

11 As explained above, the Court's "procedural" due process analysis is
essentially an equal protection analysis: The Court first disregards the
differences between "sane" insanity acquittees and civil committees, and
then simply asserts that Louisiana cannot deny Foucha the procedures it
gives civil committees. A plurality repeats this analysis in its cumulative
equal protection section. See ante, at 84-86. As explained above, I believe that there are legitimate differences between civil committees and
insanity acquittees, even after the latter have "become" sane. Therefore,
in my view, Louisiana has not denied Foucha equal protection of the laws.
Cf. Jones v. United States, 463 U. S. 354, 362, n. 10 (1983).

116 FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA

Thomas, J., dissenting
Court today ignores this well-established analytical frame-work. First, the Court never explains whether we are dealing here with a fundamental right, and, if so, what right.Second, the Court never discloses what standard of review
applies. Indeed, the Court's opinion is contradictory on
both these critical points.As to the first point: The Court begins its substantive due

process analysis by invoking the substantive right to "[f]ree-dom from bodily restraint."

Ante, at 80. Its discussion
then proceeds as if the problem here is that Foucha, an insan-ity acquittee, continues to be

confined after recovering his
sanity, ante, at 80-81; thus, the Court contrasts this case
to United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739 (1987), a case involving the confinement of pretrial detainees. But then,
abruptly, the Court shifts liberty interests. The liberty interest at stake here, we are told, is not a liberty interest in
being free "from bodily restraint," but instead the more specific (and heretofore unknown) "liberty interest under the
Constitution in being freed from [1] indefinite confinement
[2] in a mental facility." Ante, at 82 (emphasis added).
See also ante, at 86-87 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment). So the problem in this case is
apparently not that Louisiana continues to confine insanity
acquittees who have "become" sane (although earlier in the
opinion the Court interprets our decision in Jones as having
held that such confinement is unconstitutional, see ante, at
77-78), but that under Louisiana law, "sane" insanity acquittees may be held "indefinitely" "in a mental facility."

As to the second point: "A dispute regarding the appropriate standard of review may strike some as a lawyers'
quibble over words, but it is not." Metro Broadcasting, Inc.
v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 610 (1990) (O'Connor, J., dissenting).
The standard of review determines when the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment will override a State's
substantive policy choices, as reflected in its laws. The
Court initially says that "[d]ue process requires that the na504US1$69N 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT

117Cite as: 504 U. S. 71 (1992)
Thomas, J., dissenting
ture of commitment bear some reasonable relation to thepurpose for which the individual is committed." Ante, at 79

(emphasis added). Later in its opinion, however, the Courtstates that the Louisiana scheme violates substantive due
process not because it is not "reasonably related" to theState's purposes, but instead because its detention provisions
are not "sharply focused" or "carefully limited," in contrastto the scheme we upheld in

Salerno. Ante, at 81. Doesthat mean that the same standard of review applies here that

we applied in Salerno, and, if so, what is that standard?The Court quite pointedly avoids answering these questions.
Similarly, Justice O'Connor does not reveal exactly whatstandard of review she believes applicable, but appears to
advocate a heightened standard heretofore unknown in ourcase law.

Ante, at 87-88 ("It might therefore be permissiblefor Louisiana to confine an insanity acquittee who has regained sanity if . . . the nature and duration of detention weretailored to reflect pressing public safety concerns related to
the acquittee's continuing dangerousness" (emphasis added)).To the extent the Court invalidates the Louisiana scheme
on the ground that it violates some general substantive dueprocess right to "freedom from bodily restraint" that triggers strict scrutiny, it is wrong--and dangerously so. Tothe extent the Court suggests that Louisiana has violated
some more limited right to freedom from indefinite commit-ment in a mental facility (a right, by the way, never asserted
by Foucha in this or any other court) that triggers some un-known standard of review, it is also wrong. I shall discuss
these two possibilities in turn.

1
I fully agree with the Court, ante, at 80, and with Justice
Kennedy, ante, at 90, that freedom from involuntary con-finement is at the heart of the "liberty" protected by the Due

Process Clause. But a liberty interest per se is not the samething as a fundamental right. Whatever the exact scope of

504US1$69N 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT
118 FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA

Thomas, J., dissenting
the fundamental right to "freedom from bodily restraint"
recognized by our cases,12 it certainly cannot be defined at
the exceedingly great level of generality the Court suggests
today. There is simply no basis in our society's history or
in the precedents of this Court to support the existence of a
sweeping, general fundamental right to "freedom from bodily
restraint" applicable to all persons in all contexts. If convicted prisoners could claim such a right, for example, we
would subject all prison sentences to strict scrutiny. This
we have consistently refused to do. See, e. g., Chapman v.
United States, 500 U. S. 453, 465 (1991).13

The critical question here, then, is whether insanity acquittees have a fundamental right to "freedom from bodily

12 The Court cites only Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U. S. 307, 316 (1982), in
support of its assertion that "[f]reedom from bodily restraint has always
been at the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause from
arbitrary governmental action," ante, at 80. What "freedom from bodily
restraint" meant in that case, however, is completely different from what
the Court uses the phrase to mean here. Youngberg involved the substantive due process rights of an institutionalized, mentally retarded patient
who had been restrained by shackles placed on his arms for portions of
each day. See 457 U. S., at 310, and n. 4. What the Court meant by
"freedom from bodily restraint," then, was quite literally freedom not to
be physically strapped to a bed. That case in no way established the
broad "freedom from bodily restraint"--apparently meaning freedom from
all involuntary confinement--that the Court discusses today.

13 Unless the Court wishes to overturn this line of cases, its substantive

due process analysis must rest entirely on the fact that an insanity acquittee has not been convicted of a crime. Conviction is, of course, a significant event. But I am not sure that it deserves talismanic significance.
Once a State proves beyond a reasonable doubt that an individual has
committed a crime, it is, at a minimum, not obviously a matter of federal
constitutional concern whether the State proceeds to label that individual
"guilty," "guilty but insane," or "not guilty by reason of insanity." A
State may just as well decide to label its verdicts "A," "B," and "C." It
is surely rather odd to have rules of federal constitutional law turn entirely upon the label chosen by a State. Cf. Railway Express Agency,
Inc. v. Virginia, 358 U. S. 434, 441 (1959) (constitutionality of state action
should not turn on "magic words").

restraint" that triggers strict scrutiny of their confinement.Neither Foucha nor the Court provides any evidence that our

society has ever recognized any such right. To the contrary,historical evidence shows that many States have long
provided for the continued institutionalization of insanity
acquittees who remain dangerous. See, e. g., H. Weihofen,Insanity as a Defense in Criminal Law 294-332 (1933); A.

Goldstein, The Insanity Defense 148-149 (1967).Moreover, this Court has

never applied strict scrutiny to
the substance of state laws involving involuntary confine-ment of the mentally ill, much less to laws involving the confinement of insanity acquittees. To the contrary, until today
we have subjected the substance of such laws only to very
deferential review. Thus, in Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U. S.
715, 738 (1972), we held that Indiana's provisions for the indefinite institutionalization of incompetent defendants violated substantive due process because they did not bear any
"reasonable" relation to the purpose for which the defendant
was committed. Similarly, in O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422
U. S. 563 (1975), we held that the confinement of a nondangerous mentally ill person was unconstitutional not because
the State failed to show a compelling interest and narrow
tailoring, but because the State had no legitimate interest
whatsoever to justify such confinement. See id., at 575-576.
See also id., at 580 (Burger, C. J., concurring) ("Commitment
must be justified on the basis of a legitimate state interest,
and the reasons for committing a particular individual must
be established in an appropriate proceeding. Equally important, confinement must cease when those reasons no
longer exist" (emphasis added)).

Similarly, in Jones, we held (in addition to the procedural
due process holdings described above) that there was no substantive due process bar to holding an insanity acquittee beyond the period for which he could have been incarcerated
if convicted. We began by explaining the standard for our
analysis: "The Due Process Clause `requires that the nature

purposes underlying commitment of insanity acquittees [in
the District of Columbia,]" which we identified as treatment
of the insanity acquittee's mental illness and protection of
the acquittee and society, "petitioner clearly errs in contending that an acquittee's hypothetical maximum sentence provides the constitutional limit for his commitment." 463
U. S., at 368 (emphasis added). Given that the commitment
law was reasonably related to Congress' purposes, this Court
had no basis for invalidating it as a matter of substantive
due process.

It is simply wrong for the Court to assert today that we
"held" in Jones that " `the committed acquittee is entitled
to release when he has recovered his sanity or is no longer
dangerous.' " Ante, at 77 (quoting Jones, 463 U. S., at 368).14
We specifically noted in Jones that no issue regarding

the standards for the release of insanity acquittees was before us. Id., at 363, n. 11. The question we were answering
in the part of Jones from which the Court quotes was
whether it is permissible to hold an insanity acquittee for a
period longer than he could have been incarcerated if convicted, not whether it is permissible to hold him once he
becomes "sane." As noted above, our substantive due process analysis in Jones was straightforward: Did the means
chosen by Congress (commitment of insanity acquittees until

"that Louisiana may never confine dangerous insanity acquittees after
they regain mental health." Ante, at 87. Either it is true that, as a
matter of substantive due process, an insanity acquittee is " `entitled to
release when he has recovered his sanity,' " ante, at 77 (quoting Jones, 463
U. S., at 368), or it is not. The Court apparently cannot make up its mind.

they have recovered their sanity or are no longer dangerous) reasonably fit Congress' ends (treatment of the acquittee's mental illness and protection of society from his
dangerousness)? 15

In its arguments before this Court, Louisiana chose to
place primary reliance on our decision in United States v.
Salerno, 481 U. S. 739 (1987), in which we upheld provisions
of the Bail Reform Act of 1984 that allowed limited pretrial
detention of criminal suspects. That case, as the Court
notes, ante, at 81-83, is readily distinguishable. Insanity acquittees, in sharp and obvious contrast to pretrial detainees,
have had their day in court. Although they have not been
convicted of crimes, neither have they been exonerated, as
they would have been upon a determination of "not guilty"
simpliciter. Insanity acquittees thus stand in a fundamentally different position from persons who have not
been adjudicated to have committed criminal acts. That is
what distinguishes this case (and what distinguished Jones)
from Salerno and Jackson v. Indiana, supra. In Jackson, as in Salerno, the State had not proved beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused had committed criminal
acts or otherwise was dangerous. See Jones, supra, at 364,
n. 12. The Court disregards this critical distinction, and apparently deems applicable the same scrutiny to pretrial de15 As may be apparent from the discussion in text, we have not been
entirely precise as to the appropriate standard of review of legislation in
this area. Some of our cases (e. g., O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U. S. 563
(1975)) have used the language of rationality review; others (e. g., Jackson
v. Indiana, 406 U. S. 715 (1972)) have used the language of "reasonableness," which may imply a somewhat heightened standard; still others (e. g.,
Jones) have used the language of both rationality and reasonableness.
What is clear from our cases is that the appropriate scrutiny is highly
deferential, not strict. We need not decide in this case which precise
standard is applicable, since the laws under attack here are at the very
least reasonable.

Thomas, J., dissenting
tainees as to persons determined in a judicial proceeding to
have committed a criminal act.16

If the Court indeed means to suggest that all restrictions
on "freedom from bodily restraint" are subject to strict scrutiny, it has (at a minimum) wrought a revolution in the treatment of the mentally ill. Civil commitment as we know it
would almost certainly be unconstitutional; only in the rarest
of circumstances will a State be able to show a "compelling
interest," and one that can be served in no other way, in
involuntarily institutionalizing a person. All procedures involving the confinement of insanity acquittees and civil committees would require revamping to meet strict scrutiny.
Thus, to take one obvious example, the automatic commitment of insanity acquittees that we expressly upheld in
Jones would be clearly unconstitutional, since it is inconceivable that such commitment of persons who may well presently be sane and nondangerous could survive strict scrutiny.
(In Jones, of course, we applied no such scrutiny; we upheld
the practice not because it was justified by a compelling in16 The Court asserts that the principles set forth in this dissent necessarily apply not only to insanity acquittees, but also to convicted prisoners.
"Justice Thomas' rationale for continuing to hold the insanity acquittee
would surely justify treating the convicted felon in the same way, and if
put to it, it appears that he would permit it." Ante, at 83, n. 6. That is
obviously not so. If Foucha had been convicted of the crimes with which
he was charged and sentenced to the statutory maximum of 32 years in
prison, the State would not be entitled to extend his sentence at the end
of that period. To do so would obviously violate the prohibition on ex post
facto laws set forth in Art. I, $ 10, cl. 1. But Foucha was not sentenced to
incarceration for any definite period of time; to the contrary, he pleaded
not guilty by reason of insanity and was ordered institutionalized until he
was able to meet the conditions statutorily prescribed for his release. To
acknowledge, as I do, that it is constitutionally permissible for a State
to provide for the continued confinement of an insanity acquittee who
remains dangerous is obviously quite different than to assert that the
State is allowed to confine anyone who is dangerous for as long as it
wishes.

terest, but because it was based on reasonable legislativeinferences about continuing insanity and dangerousness.)

2
As explained above, the Court's opinion is profoundly am-biguous on the central question in this case: Must the State

of Louisiana release Terry Foucha now that he has "re-gained" his sanity? In other words, is the defect in Louisiana's statutory scheme that it provides for the confinementof insanity acquittees who have recovered their sanity, or
instead that it allows the State to confine sane insanity ac-quittees (1) indefinitely (2) in a mental facility? To the extent the Court suggests the former, I have already explainedwhy it is wrong. I turn now to the latter possibility, which
also is mistaken.To begin with, I think it is somewhat misleading to describe Louisiana's scheme as providing for the "indefinite"commitment of insanity acquittees. As explained above, insanity acquittees are entitled to a release hearing every yearat their request, and at any time at the request of a facility
superintendent. Like the District of Columbia statute atissue in Jones, then, Louisiana's statute provides for "indefinite" commitment only to the extent that an acquittee is un-able to satisfy the substantive standards for release. If the
Constitution did not require a cap on the acquittee's con-finement in

Jones, why does it require one here? The Courtand
Justice O'Connor have no basis for suggesting thateither this Court or the society of which it is a part has

recognized some general fundamental right to "freedom fromindefinite commitment." If that were the case, of course,
Jones would have involved strict scrutiny and is wronglydecided.

Furthermore, any concerns about "indefinite" commitmenthere are entirely hypothetical and speculative. Foucha has
been confined for eight years. Had he been convicted of thecrimes with which he was charged, he could have been incar504US1$69N 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT
124 FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA

Thomas, J., dissenting
cerated for 32 years. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $$ 14:60, 14:94(West 1986). Thus, I find quite odd

Justice O'Connor'ssuggestion,
ante, at 89, that this case might be different hadLouisiana, like the State of Washington, limited confinement

to the period for which a defendant might have been impris-oned if convicted. Foucha, of course, would be in precisely
the same position today--and for the next 24 years--had theLouisiana statute included such a cap. Thus, the Court apparently finds fault with the Louisiana statute not becauseit has been applied to Foucha in an unconstitutional manner,
but because the Court can imagine it being applied to someone else in an unconstitutional manner. That goes againstthe first principles of our jurisprudence. See,

e. g., Salerno,481 U. S., at 745 ("The fact that [a detention statute] might

operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of cir-cumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid, since
we have not recognized an `overbreadth' doctrine outside thelimited context of the First Amendment").

17

Finally, I see no basis for holding that the Due ProcessClause per se prohibits a State from continuing to confine in

a "mental institution"--the federal constitutional definitionof which remains unclear--an insanity acquittee who has recovered his sanity. As noted above, many States have longprovided for the continued detention of insanity acquittees
who remain dangerous. Neither Foucha nor the Court pre-sent any evidence that these States have traditionally transferred such persons from mental institutions to other deten-tion facilities. Therefore, there is simply no basis for this
Court to recognize a "fundamental right" for a sane insanityacquittee to be transferred out of a mental facility. "In an
attempt to limit and guide interpretation of the [Due Proc-ess] Clause, we have insisted not merely that the interest

17 I fully agree with Justice O'Connor, ante, at 88, that there would
be a serious question of rationality had Louisiana sought to institutionalize
a sane insanity acquittee for a period longer than he might have been
imprisoned if convicted. But that is simply not the case here.

denominated as a `liberty' be `fundamental' (a concept that,in isolation, is hard to objectify), but also that it be an interest traditionally protected by our society." Michael H. v.Gerald D., 491 U. S. 110, 122 (1989) (plurality opinion).

Removing sane insanity acquittees from mental institu-tions may make eminent sense as a policy matter, but the
Due Process Clause does not require the States to conformto the policy preferences of federal judges. "The Court is
most vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when itdeals with judge-made constitutional law having little or no
cognizable roots in the language or design of the Constitu-tion."

Bowers, 478 U. S., at 194. I have no idea whatfacilities the Court or

Justice O'Connor believe the DueProcess Clause mandates for the confinement of sane-butdangerous insanity acquittees. Presumably prisons will notdo, since imprisonment is generally regarded as "punishment." May a State designate a wing of a mental insti-tution or prison for sane insanity acquittees? May a State
mix them with other detainees? Neither the Constitutionnor our society's traditions provide any answer to these
questions.18 3

18 In particular circumstances, of course, it may be unconstitutional for
a State to confine in a mental institution a person who is no longer insane.
This would be a different case had Foucha challenged specific conditions
of confinement--for instance, being forced to share a cell with an insane
person, or being involuntarily treated after recovering his sanity. But
Foucha has alleged nothing of the sort--all we know is that the State
continues to confine him in a place called the Feliciana Forensic Facility.
It is by no means clear that such confinement is invariably worse than,
for example, confinement in a jail or other detention center--for all we
know, an institution may provide a quieter, less violent atmosphere. I do
not mean to suggest that that is the case--my point is only that the issue
cannot be resolved in the abstract.

Syllabus

RIGGINS v. NEVADA
certiorari to the supreme court of nevada
No. 90-8466. Argued January 15, 1992--Decided May 18, 1992
When petitioner Riggins, while awaiting a Nevada trial on murder and

robbery charges, complained of hearing voices and having sleep problems, a psychiatrist prescribed the antipsychotic drug Mellaril. After
he was found competent to stand trial, Riggins made a motion to suspend the Mellaril's administration until after his trial, arguing that its
use infringed upon his freedom, that its effect on his demeanor and
mental state during trial would deny him due process, and that he had
the right to show jurors his true mental state when he offered an insanity defense. After hearing the testimony of doctors who had examined
Riggins, the trial court denied the motion with a one-page order giving
no indication of its rationale. At Riggins' trial, he presented his insanity defense and testified, was convicted, and was sentenced to death.
In affirming, the State Supreme Court held, inter alia, that expert testimony presented at trial was sufficient to inform the jury of the Mellaril's
effect on Riggins' demeanor and testimony.

Held: The forced administration of antipsychotic medication during Riggins' trial violated rights guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth
Amendments. Pp. 133-138.

(a) The record narrowly defines the issues in this case. Administration of Mellaril was involuntary once Riggins' motion to terminate its
use was denied, but its administration was medically appropriate. In
addition, Riggins' Eighth Amendment argument that the drug's administration denied him the opportunity to show jurors his true mental condition at the sentencing hearing was not raised below or in the
petition for certiorari and, thus, will not be considered by this Court.
P. 133.

(b) A pretrial detainee has an interest in avoiding involuntary administration of antipsychotic drugs that is protected under the Due Process
Clause. Cf. Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210; Bell v. Wolfish, 441
U. S. 520, 545. Once Riggins moved to terminate his treatment, the
State became obligated to establish both the need for Mellaril and its
medical appropriateness. Cf. Harper, supra, at 227. Due process certainly would have been satisfied had the State shown that the treatment
was medically appropriate and, considering less intrusive alternatives,
essential for Riggins' own safety or the safety of others. The State
also might have been able to justify the treatment, if medically appro504us1$70L 04-10-96 12:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT

Syllabus
priate, by showing that an adjudication of guilt or innocence could not
be obtained by using less intrusive means. However, the trial court
allowed the drug's administration to continue without making any determination of the need for this course or any findings about reasonable
alternatives, and it failed to acknowledge Riggins' liberty interest in
freedom from antipsychotic drugs. Pp. 133-137.

(c) There is a strong possibility that the trial court's error impaired
Riggins' constitutionally protected trial rights. Efforts to prove or
disprove actual prejudice from the record before this Court would be
futile, and guesses as to the trial's outcome had Riggins' motion been
granted would be speculative. While the precise consequences of forcing Mellaril upon him cannot be shown from a trial transcript, the testimony of doctors who examined Riggins establishes the strong possibility that his defense was impaired. Mellaril's side effects may have
impacted not only his outward appearance, but also his testimony's content, his ability to follow the proceedings, or the substance of his communication with counsel. Thus, even if the expert testimony presented
at trial allowed jurors to assess Riggins' demeanor fairly, an unacceptable risk remained that forced medication compromised his trial rights.
Pp. 137-138.

(d) While trial prejudice can sometimes be justified by an essential
state interest, the record here contains no finding to support a conclusion that administration of antipsychotic medication was necessary to
accomplish an essential state policy. P. 138.

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
Petitioner David Riggins challenges his murder and rob-bery convictions on the ground that the State of Nevada unconstitutionally forced an antipsychotic drug upon him dur-ing trial. Because the Nevada courts failed to make findings
sufficient to support forced administration of the drug, wereverse.

I
During the early hours of November 20, 1987, Paul Wadewas found dead in his Las Vegas apartment. An autopsy

revealed that Wade died from multiple stab wounds, includ-ing wounds to the head, chest, and back. David Riggins was
arrested for the killing 45 hours later.A few days after being taken into custody, Riggins told
Dr. R. Edward Quass, a private psychiatrist who treated pa-tients at the Clark County Jail, about hearing voices in his
head and having trouble sleeping. Riggins informed Dr.Quass that he had been successfully treated with Mellaril
in the past. Mellaril is the trade name for thioridazine, anantipsychotic drug. After this consultation, Dr. Quass prescribed Mellaril at a level of 100 milligrams per day. Be-cause Riggins continued to complain of voices and sleep problems in the following months, Dr. Quass gradually increasedthe Mellaril prescription to 800 milligrams per day. Riggins
also received a prescription for Dilantin, an antiepilepticdrug.

In January 1988, Riggins successfully moved for a deter-mination of his competence to stand trial. App. 6. Three

130 RIGGINS v. NEVADA

Opinion of the Court
court-appointed psychiatrists performed examinations during February and March, while Riggins was taking 450 milligrams of Mellaril daily. Dr. William O'Gorman, a psychiatrist who had treated Riggins for anxiety in 1982, and Dr.
Franklin Master concluded that Riggins was competent to
stand trial. The third psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Jurasky, found
that Riggins was incompetent. The Clark County District
Court determined that Riggins was legally sane and competent to stand trial, id., at 13, so preparations for trial went
forward.

In early June, the defense moved the District Court for an
order suspending administration of Mellaril and Dilantin
until the end of Riggins' trial. Id., at 20. Relying on both
the Fourteenth Amendment and the Nevada Constitution,
Riggins argued that continued administration of these drugs
infringed upon his freedom and that the drugs' effect on his
demeanor and mental state during trial would deny him due
process. Riggins also asserted that, because he would offer
an insanity defense at trial, he had a right to show jurors his
"true mental state." Id., at 22. In response, the State
noted that Nevada law prohibits the trial of incompetent
persons, see Nev. Rev. Stat. $ 178.400 (1989), and argued
that the court therefore had authority to compel Riggins to
take medication necessary to ensure his competence. App.
31-32.

On July 14, 1988, the District Court held an evidentiary
hearing on Riggins' motion. At the hearing, Dr. Master
"guess[ed]" that taking Riggins off medication would not noticeably alter his behavior or render him incompetent to
stand trial. Record 412. Dr. Quass testified that, in his
opinion, Riggins would be competent to stand trial even
without the administration of Mellaril, but that the effects
of Mellaril would not be noticeable to jurors if medication
continued. Id., at 443-445. Finally, Dr. O'Gorman told the
court that Mellaril made the defendant calmer and more re504us1$70L 04-10-96 12:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT

131Cite as: 504 U. S. 127 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
laxed but that an excessive dose would cause drowsiness.
Id., at 464-466. Dr. O'Gorman was unable to predict how
Riggins might behave if taken off antipsychotic medication,
yet he questioned the need to give Riggins the high dose he
was receiving. Id., at 474-476. The court also had before
it a written report in which Dr. Jurasky held to his earlier
view that Riggins was incompetent to stand trial and predicted that if taken off Mellaril the defendant "would most
likely regress to a manifest psychosis and become extremely
difficult to manage." App. 19.

The District Court denied Riggins' motion to terminate
medication with a one-page order that gave no indication of
the court's rationale. Id., at 49. Riggins continued to receive 800 milligrams of Mellaril each day through the completion of his trial the following November.

At trial, Riggins presented an insanity defense and testified on his own behalf. He indicated that on the night of
Wade's death he used cocaine before going to Wade's apartment. Riggins admitted fighting with Wade, but claimed
that Wade was trying to kill him and that voices in his head
said that killing Wade would be justifiable homicide. A jury
found Riggins guilty of murder with use of a deadly weapon
and robbery with use of a deadly weapon. After a penalty
hearing, the same jury set the murder sentence at death.

Riggins presented several claims to the Nevada Supreme
Court, among them that forced administration of Mellaril denied him the ability to assist in his own defense and prejudicially affected his attitude, appearance, and demeanor at
trial. This prejudice was not justified, Riggins said in his
opening brief, because the State neither demonstrated a
need to administer Mellaril nor explored alternatives to giving him 800 milligrams of the drug each day. Record 1020.
Riggins amplified this claim in his reply brief, objecting that
the State intruded upon his constitutionally protected lib504us1$70L 04-10-96 12:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT
132 RIGGINS v. NEVADA

Opinion of the Court
erty interest in freedom from antipsychotic drugs withoutconsidering less intrusive options. Riggins argued:

"In United States v. Bryant, 670 F. Supp. 840, 843(Minn. 1987)[,] the court, in reference to medicating prisoners against their will, stated that `courts have recog-nized a

protectable liberty interest . . . in the freedom
to avoid unwanted medication with such drugs.' Thecourt in so stating cited

Bee v. Greaves, 744 F. 2d 1387
(10th Cir. 1984)[,] which addressed the issue of medicat-ing pre-trial detainees and stated that `less restrictive

alternatives, such as segregation or the use of less controversial drugs like tranquilizers or sedatives, shouldbe ruled out before resorting to antipsychotic drugs.'

In the case at bar, no less restrictive alternatives wereutilized, considered or even proposed." Record 1070-
1071 (emphasis in original).
The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed Riggins' convictions
and death sentence. 107 Nev. 178, 808 P. 2d 535 (1991).With respect to administration of Mellaril, the court held

that expert testimony presented at trial "was sufficient toinform the jury of the effect of the Mellaril on Riggins' demeanor and testimony." Id., at 181, 808 P. 2d, at 538. Thus,although Riggins' demeanor was relevant to his insanity defense, the court held that denial of the defense's motion to
terminate medication was neither an abuse of discretion nora violation of Riggins' trial rights. In a concurring opinion,

Justice Rose suggested that the District Court should havedetermined whether administration of Mellaril during trial
was "absolutely necessary" by ordering a pretrial suspension
of medication. Id., at 185, 808 P. 2d, at 540 (concurring opinion). Justice Springer dissented, arguing that antipsychotic
drugs may never be forced on a criminal defendant solely to
allow prosecution. Id., at 186, 808 P. 2d, at 541.

We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 807 (1991), to decide
whether forced administration of antipsychotic medication

Opinion of the Court
during trial violated rights guaranteed by the Sixth andFourteenth Amendments.

II
The record in this case narrowly defines the issues beforeus. The parties have indicated that once the District Court

denied Riggins' motion to terminate use of Mellaril, subse-quent administration of the drug was involuntary. See,

e. g.,Brief for Petitioner 6 (medication was "forced"); Brief for

Respondent 14, 22, 28 (describing medication as "unwanted,""over objection," and "compelled"). This understanding accords with the determination of the Nevada Supreme Court.See 107 Nev., at 181; 808 P. 2d, at 537 (describing medication
as "involuntary" and "forced"). Given the parties' positionson this point and the absence of any record evidence to the
contrary, we adhere to the understanding of the State Su-preme Court.

We also presume that administration of Mellaril was medi-cally appropriate. Although defense counsel stressed that
Riggins received a very high dose of the drug, at no pointdid he suggest to the Nevada courts that administration of
Mellaril was medically improper treatment for his client.Finally, the record is dispositive with respect to Riggins'
Eighth Amendment claim that administration of Mellaril de-nied him an opportunity to show jurors his true mental condition at the sentencing hearing. Because this argumentwas presented neither to the Nevada Supreme Court nor
in Riggins' petition for certiorari, we do not address it here.With these considerations in mind, we turn to Riggins'
core contention that involuntary administration of Mellarildenied him "a full and fair trial." Pet. for Cert. i. Our
discussion in Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210 (1990),provides useful background for evaluating this claim. In
Harper, a prison inmate alleged that the State of Washingtonand various individuals violated his right to due process by
giving him Mellaril and other antipsychotic drugs against hiswill. Although the inmate did not prevail, we agreed that

134 RIGGINS v. NEVADA

Opinion of the Court
his interest in avoiding involuntary administration of anti-psychotic drugs was protected under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. "The forcible injection ofmedication into a nonconsenting person's body," we said,
"represents a substantial interference with that person's liberty." Id., at 229. In the case of antipsychotic drugs likeMellaril, that interference is particularly severe:

"The purpose of the drugs is to alter the chemical balance in a patient's brain, leading to changes, intended tobe beneficial, in his or her cognitive processes. While

the therapeutic benefits of antipsychotic drugs are well
documented, it is also true that the drugs can have seri-ous, even fatal, side effects. One such side effect identified by the trial court is acute dystonia, a severe involun-tary spasm of the upper body, tongue, throat, or eyes.
The trial court found that it may be treated and re-versed within a few minutes through use of the medication Cogentin. Other side effects include akathesia
(motor restlessness, often characterized by an inabilityto sit still); neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a relatively

rare condition which can lead to death from cardiac dys-function); and tardive dyskinesia, perhaps the most discussed side effect of antipsychotic drugs. Tardive dys-kinesia is a neurological disorder, irreversible in some
cases, that is characterized by involuntary, uncontrolla-ble movements of various muscles, especially around the
face. . . . [T]he proportion of patients treated with antipsychotic drugs who exhibit the symptoms of tardivedyskinesia ranges from 10% to 25%. According to the

Opinion of the Court
mentally ill inmate to be treated involuntarily with antipsy-chotic drugs where there is a determination that "the inmate

is dangerous to himself or others and the treatment is in theinmate's medical interest."

Id., at 227.
Under Harper, forcing antipsychotic drugs on a convicted
prisoner is impermissible absent a finding of overridingjustification and a determination of medical appropriateness.

The Fourteenth Amendment affords at least as much pro-tection to persons the State detains for trial. See

Bell v.
Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 545 (1979) ("[P]retrial detainees, whohave not been convicted of any crimes, retain at least those

constitutional rights that we have held are enjoyed by convicted prisoners"); O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U. S. 342,
349 (1987) ("[P]rison regulations . . . are judged under a
`reasonableness' test less restrictive than that ordinarily applied to alleged infringements of fundamental constitutional
rights"). Thus, once Riggins moved to terminate administration of antipsychotic medication, the State became obligated to establish the need for Mellaril and the medical
appropriateness of the drug.

Although we have not had occasion to develop substantive
standards for judging forced administration of such drugs in
the trial or pretrial settings, Nevada certainly would have
satisfied due process if the prosecution had demonstrated,
and the District Court had found, that treatment with antipsychotic medication was medically appropriate and, considering less intrusive alternatives, essential for the sake of
Riggins' own safety or the safety of others. See Harper,
supra, at 225-226; cf. Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418
(1979) (Due Process Clause allows civil commitment of individuals shown by clear and convincing evidence to be mentally ill and dangerous). Similarly, the State might have
been able to justify medically appropriate, involuntary treatment with the drug by establishing that it could not obtain
an adjudication of Riggins' guilt or innocence by using less
intrusive means. See Illinois v. Allen, 397 U. S. 337, 347

136 RIGGINS v. NEVADA

Opinion of the Court
(1970) (Brennan, J., concurring) ("Constitutional power tobring an accused to trial is fundamental to a scheme of `ordered liberty' and prerequisite to social justice and peace").We note that during the July 14 hearing Riggins did not
contend that he had the right to be tried without Mellaril if
its discontinuation rendered him incompetent. See Record424-425, 496, 500. The question whether a competent criminal defendant may refuse antipsychotic medication if cessa-tion of medication would render him incompetent at trial is
not before us.Contrary to the dissent's understanding, we do not "adopt
a standard of strict scrutiny." Post, at 156. We have no
occasion to finally prescribe such substantive standards as
mentioned above, since the District Court allowed administration of Mellaril to continue without making any determination of the need for this course or any findings about
reasonable alternatives. The court's laconic order denying
Riggins' motion did not adopt the State's view, which was
that continued administration of Mellaril was required to ensure that the defendant could be tried; in fact, the hearing
testimony casts considerable doubt on that argument. See
supra, at 130-131. Nor did the order indicate a finding that
safety considerations or other compelling concerns outweighed Riggins' interest in freedom from unwanted antipsychotic drugs.

Were we to divine the District Court's logic from the hearing transcript, we would have to conclude that the court simply weighed the risk that the defense would be prejudiced
by changes in Riggins' outward appearance against the
chance that Riggins would become incompetent if taken off
Mellaril, and struck the balance in favor of involuntary medication. See Record 502 ("[T]hat he was nervous and so
forth . . . can all be brought out [through expert testimony].
And when you start weighing the consequences of taking
him off his medication and possibly have him revert into an
incompetent situation, I don't think that that is a good exper504us1$70L 04-10-96 12:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
iment"). The court did not acknowledge the defendant's lib-erty interest in freedom from unwanted antipsychotic drugs.

This error may well have impaired the constitutionallyprotected trial rights Riggins invokes. At the hearing to
consider terminating medication, Dr. O'Gorman suggested
that the dosage administered to Riggins was within the toxicrange,

id., at 483, and could make him "uptight," id., at 484.
Dr. Master testified that a patient taking 800 milligrams ofMellaril each day might suffer from drowsiness or confusion.

Id., at 416. Cf. Brief for American Psychiatric Associationas

Amicus Curiae 10-11 ("[I]n extreme cases, the sedationlike effect [of antipsychotic medication] may be severe
enough (akinesia) to affect thought processes"). It is clearly
possible that such side effects had an impact upon not just
Riggins' outward appearance, but also the content of his
testimony on direct or cross examination, his ability to follow the proceedings, or the substance of his communication
with counsel.

Efforts to prove or disprove actual prejudice from the record before us would be futile, and guesses whether the outcome of the trial might have been different if Riggins' motion
had been granted would be purely speculative. We accordingly reject the dissent's suggestion that Riggins should be
required to demonstrate how the trial would have proceeded
differently if he had not been given Mellaril. See post, at
149-150. Like the consequences of compelling a defendant
to wear prison clothing, see Estelle v. Williams, 425 U. S.
501, 504-505 (1976), or of binding and gagging an accused
during trial, see Allen, supra, at 344, the precise consequences of forcing antipsychotic medication upon Riggins
cannot be shown from a trial transcript. What the testimony of doctors who examined Riggins establishes, and what
we will not ignore, is a strong possibility that Riggins' defense was impaired due to the administration of Mellaril.

We also are persuaded that allowing Riggins to present
expert testimony about the effect of Mellaril on his de504us1$70L 04-10-96 12:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT
138 RIGGINS v. NEVADA

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
meanor did nothing to cure the possibility that the substanceof his own testimony, his interaction with counsel, or his comprehension at trial were compromised by forced administra-tion of Mellaril. Even if (as the dissent argues,

post, at
147-149) the Nevada Supreme Court was right that expert
testimony allowed jurors to assess Riggins' demeanor fairly,an unacceptable risk of prejudice remained. See 107 Nev.,

at 181, 808 P. 2d, at 537-538.To be sure, trial prejudice can sometimes be justified by
an essential state interest. See Holbrook v. Flynn, 475 U. S.560, 568-569 (1986);

Allen, supra, at 344 (binding and gagging the accused permissible only in extreme situationswhere it is the "fairest and most reasonable way" to control

a disruptive defendant); see also Williams, supra, at 505
(compelling defendants to wear prison clothing at trial furthers no essential state policy). Because the record contains
no finding that might support a conclusion that administration of antipsychotic medication was necessary to accomplish
an essential state policy, however, we have no basis for saying that the substantial probability of trial prejudice in this
case was justified.

The judgment of the Nevada Supreme Court is reversed,
and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Kennedy, concurring in the judgment.
The medical and pharmacological data in the amicus briefs
and other sources indicate that involuntary medication with
antipsychotic drugs poses a serious threat to a defendant's
right to a fair trial. In the case before us, there was no
hearing or well-developed record on the point, and the whole
subject of treating incompetence to stand trial by drug medication is somewhat new to the law, if not to medicine. On
the sparse record before us, we cannot give full consideration
to the issue. I file this separate opinion, however, to express

139Cite as: 504 U. S. 127 (1992)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
my view that absent an extraordinary showing by the State,the Due Process Clause prohibits prosecuting officials from

administering involuntary doses of antipsychotic medicinesfor purposes of rendering the accused competent for trial,
and to express doubt that the showing can be made in most
cases, given our present understanding of the properties ofthese drugs.

At the outset, I express full agreement with the Court'sconclusion that one who was medicated against his will in
order to stand trial may challenge his conviction. When theState commands medication during the pretrial and trial
phases of the case for the avowed purpose of changing the
defendant's behavior, the concerns are much the same as if it
were alleged that the prosecution had manipulated material
evidence. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, 87 (1963)
(suppression by the prosecution of material evidence favorable to the accused violates due process); Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U. S. 51, 58 (1988) (bad-faith failure to preserve
potentially useful evidence constitutes a due process violation). I cannot accept the premise of Justice Thomas' dissent that the involuntary medication order comprises some
separate procedure, unrelated to the trial and foreclosed
from inquiry or review in the criminal proceeding itself. To
the contrary, the allegations pertain to the State's interference with the trial. Thus, review in the criminal proceeding
is appropriate.

I also agree with the majority that the State has a legitimate interest in attempting to restore the competence of otherwise incompetent defendants. Its interest derives from
the State's right to bring an accused to trial and from our
holding in Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S. 375, 378 (1966), that
conviction of an incompetent defendant violates due process.
Unless a defendant is competent, the State cannot put him
on trial. Competence to stand trial is rudimentary, for upon
it depends the main part of those rights deemed essential to
a fair trial, including the right to effective assistance of coun504us1$70L 04-10-96 12:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
sel, the rights to summon, to confront, and to cross-examinewitnesses, and the right to testify on one's own behalf or to

remain silent without penalty for doing so. Drope v. Missouri, 420 U. S. 162, 171-172 (1975). Although the majority
is correct that this case does not require us to address the
question whether a defendant may waive his right to be triedwhile competent, in my view a general rule permitting

waiver would not withstand scrutiny under the Due ProcessClause, given our holdings in

Pate and Drope. A defendant's waiver of the right to be tried while competent wouldcast doubt on his exercise or waiver of all subsequent rights

and privileges through the whole course of the trial.

The question is whether the State's interest in conducting
the trial allows it to ensure the defendant's competence by
involuntary medication, assuming of course there is a sound
medical basis for the treatment. The Court's opinion will
require further proceedings on remand, but there seems to
be little discussion about what is to be considered. The
Court's failure to address these issues is understandable in
some respects, for it was not the subject of briefing or argument; but to underscore my reservations about the propriety
of involuntary medication for the purpose of rendering the
defendant competent, and to explain what I think ought to
be express qualifications of the Court's opinion, some discussion of the point is required.

This is not a case like Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210
(1990), in which the purpose of the involuntary medication
was to ensure that the incarcerated person ceased to be a
physical danger to himself or others. The inquiry in that
context is both objective and manageable. Here the purpose
of the medication is not merely to treat a person with grave
psychiatric disorders and enable that person to function and
behave in a way not dangerous to himself or others, but
rather to render the person competent to stand trial. It is
the last part of the State's objective, medicating the person
for the purpose of bringing him to trial, that causes most

141Cite as: 504 U. S. 127 (1992)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
serious concern. If the only question were whether some
bare level of functional competence can be induced, that
would be a grave matter in itself, but here there are even
more far reaching concerns. The avowed purpose of the
medication is not functional competence, but competence to
stand trial. In my view elementary protections against
state intrusion require the State in every case to make a
showing that there is no significant risk that the medication
will impair or alter in any material way the defendant's capacity or willingness to react to the testimony at trial or to
assist his counsel. Based on my understanding of the medical literature, I have substantial reservations that the State
can make that showing. Indeed, the inquiry itself is elusive,
for it assumes some baseline of normality that experts may
have some difficulty in establishing for a particular defendant, if they can establish it at all. These uncertainties serve
to underscore the difficult terrain the State must traverse
when it enters this domain.

To make these concerns concrete, the effects of antipsychotic drugs must be addressed. First introduced in the
1950's, antipsychotic drugs such as Mellaril have wide acceptance in the psychiatric community as an effective treatment
for psychotic thought disorders. See American Psychiatric
Press Textbook of Psychiatry 770-774 (J. Talbott, R. Hales, &
S. Yodofsky eds. 1988) (Textbook of Psychiatry); Brief for
American Psychiatric Association as Amicus Curiae 6-7.
The medications restore normal thought processes by clearing hallucinations and delusions. Textbook of Psychiatry
774. See also Brief for American Psychiatric Association as
Amicus Curiae 9 ("The mental health produced by antipsychotic medication is no different from, no more inauthentic
or alien to the patient than, the physical health produced by
other medications, such as penicillin for pneumonia"). For
many patients, no effective alternative exists for treatment
of their illnesses. Id., at 7, and n. 3.

142 RIGGINS v. NEVADA

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
Although these drugs have changed the lives of psychiatricpatients, they can have unwanted side effects. We documented some of the more serious side effects in Washingtonv.

Harper, supra, at 229-230, and they are mentioned again
in the majority opinion. More relevant to this case are side
effects that, it appears, can compromise the right of a medi-cated criminal defendant to receive a fair trial. The drugs

can prejudice the accused in two principal ways: (1) by alter-ing his demeanor in a manner that will prejudice his reactions and presentation in the courtroom, and (2) by renderinghim unable or unwilling to assist counsel.

It is a fundamental assumption of the adversary system
that the trier of fact observes the accused throughout the
trial, while the accused is either on the stand or sitting at
the defense table. This assumption derives from the right
to be present at trial, which in turn derives from the right
to testify and rights under the Confrontation Clause. Taylor v. United States, 414 U. S. 17, 19 (1973) (per curiam).
At all stages of the proceedings, the defendant's behavior,
manner, facial expressions, and emotional responses, or their
absence, combine to make an overall impression on the trier
of fact, an impression that can have a powerful influence on
the outcome of the trial. If the defendant takes the stand,
as Riggins did, his demeanor can have a great bearing on his
credibility and persuasiveness, and on the degree to which
he evokes sympathy. The defendant's demeanor may also
be relevant to his confrontation rights. See Coy v. Iowa,
487 U. S. 1012, 1016-1020 (1988) (emphasizing the importance
of the face-to-face encounter between the accused and the
accuser).

The side effects of antipsychotic drugs may alter demeanor
in a way that will prejudice all facets of the defense. Serious due process concerns are implicated when the State manipulates the evidence in this way. The defendant may be
restless and unable to sit still. Brief for American Psychiatric Association as Amicus Curiae 10. The drugs can induce

a condition called parkinsonism, which, like Parkinson's dis-ease, is characterized by tremor of the limbs, diminished

range of facial expression, or slowed functions, such asspeech.

Ibid. Some of the side effects are more subtle.
Antipsychotic drugs such as Mellaril can have a "sedationlike effect" that in severe cases may affect thought processes.
Ibid. At trial, Dr. Jurasky testified that Mellaril has "a
tranquilizer effect." Record 752. See also ibid. ("If youare dealing with someone very sick then you may prescribe

up to 800 milligrams which is the dose he had been takingwhich is very, very high. I mean you can tranquilize an
elephant with 800 milligrams"). Dr. Jurasky listed thefollowing side effects of large doses of Mellaril: "Drowsiness, constipation, perhaps lack of alertness, changes in blood
pressure. . . . Depression of the psychomotor functions. Ifyou take a lot of it you become stoned for all practical

purposes and can barely function." Id., at 753.These potential side effects would be disturbing for any
patient; but when the patient is a criminal defendant who isgoing to stand trial, the documented probability of side effects seems to me to render involuntary administration ofthe drugs by prosecuting officials unacceptable absent a
showing by the State that the side effects will not alter the
defendant's reactions or diminish his capacity to assist coun-sel. As the American Psychiatric Association points out:

"By administering medication, the State may be creating a prejudicial negative demeanor in the defendant--
making him look nervous and restless, for example, orso calm or sedated as to appear bored, cold, unfeeling,

and unresponsive. . . . That such effects may be subtle
does not make them any less real or potentially influential." Brief for American Psychiatric Association as
Amicus Curiae 13.

As any trial attorney will attest, serious prejudice could
result if medication inhibits the defendant's capacity to react

144 RIGGINS v. NEVADA

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
and respond to the proceedings and to demonstrate remorseor compassion. The prejudice can be acute during the sentencing phase of the proceedings, when the sentencer mustattempt to know the heart and mind of the offender and
judge his character, his contrition or its absence, and his future dangerousness. In a capital sentencing proceeding, as-sessments of character and remorse may carry great weight

and, perhaps, be determinative of whether the offender livesor dies. See Geimer & Amsterdam, Why Jurors Vote Life
or Death: Operative Factors in Ten Florida Death PenaltyCases, 15 Am. J. Crim. L. 1, 51-53 (1987-1988).

Concerns about medication extend also to the issue of
cooperation with counsel. We have held that a defendant's
right to the effective assistance of counsel is impaired when
he cannot cooperate in an active manner with his lawyer.
Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201 (1964); Geders v.
United States, 425 U. S. 80 (1976) (trial court order directing
defendant not to consult with his lawyer during an overnight
recess held to deprive him of the effective assistance of counsel). The defendant must be able to provide needed information to his lawyer and to participate in the making of decisions on his own behalf. The side effects of antipsychotic
drugs can hamper the attorney-client relation, preventing effective communication and rendering the defendant less able
or willing to take part in his defense. The State interferes
with this relation when it administers a drug to dull cognition. See Brief for National Association of Criminal
Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 42 ("[T]he chemical
flattening of a person's will can also lead to the defendant's
loss of self-determination undermining the desire for selfpreservation which is necessary to engage the defendant in
his own defense in preparation for his trial").

It is well established that the defendant has the right to
testify on his own behalf, a right we have found essential to
our adversary system. In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257, 273
(1948). We have found the right implicit as well in the Com504us1$70L 04-10-96 12:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT

145Cite as: 504 U. S. 127 (1992)

pulsory Process Clause of the Sixth Amendment. Rock v.
Arkansas, 483 U. S. 44 (1987). In Rock, we held that a state
rule excluding all testimony aided or refreshed by hypnosisviolated the defendant's constitutional right to take the stand

in her own defense. We observed that barring the testimony would contradict not only the right of the accused toconduct her own defense, but also her right to make this

defense in person: " `It is the accused, not counsel, who mustbe "informed of the nature and cause of the accusation," who
must be "confronted with the witnesses against him," andwho must be accorded "compulsory process for obtaining
witnesses in his favor." ' " Id., at 52, quoting Faretta v. California, 422 U. S. 806, 819 (1975). We gave further recognition to the right of the accused to testify in his or her own
words, and noted that this in turn was related to the Fifth
Amendment choice to speak "in the unfettered exercise of
his own will." Rock, supra, at 53. In my view medication
of the type here prescribed may be for the very purpose of
imposing constraints on the defendant's own will, and for
that reason its legitimacy is put in grave doubt.

If the State cannot render the defendant competent without involuntary medication, then it must resort to civil commitment, if appropriate, unless the defendant becomes competent through other means. If the defendant cannot be
tried without his behavior and demeanor being affected in
this substantial way by involuntary treatment, in my view
the Constitution requires that society bear this cost in order
to preserve the integrity of the trial process. The state of
our knowledge of antipsychotic drugs and their side effects
is evolving and may one day produce effective drugs that
have only minimal side effects. Until that day comes, we
can permit their use only when the State can show that involuntary treatment does not cause alterations raising the concerns enumerated in this separate opinion.

With these observations, I concur in the judgment reversing the conviction.

146 RIGGINS v. NEVADA

Thomas, J., dissenting
Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins except as to Part II-A, dissenting.

Petitioner David Edward Riggins killed Paul William
Wade by stabbing him 32 times with a knife. He then took
cash, drugs, and other items from Wade's home. A Nevada
jury convicted Riggins of first-degree murder and robbery
with a deadly weapon and sentenced him to death. The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed. 107 Nev. 178, 808 P. 2d 535
(1991). This Court reverses the conviction, holding that Nevada unconstitutionally deprived Riggins of his liberty interest in avoiding unwanted medication by compelling him to
take an antipsychotic drug. I respectfully dissent.

The Court's opinion, in my view, conflates two distinct
questions: whether Riggins had a full and fair criminal trial
and whether Nevada improperly forced Riggins to take medication. In this criminal case, Riggins is asking, and may
ask, only for the reversal of his conviction and sentence. He
is not seeking, and may not seek, an injunction to terminate
his medical treatment or damages for an infringement of his
personal rights. I agree with the positions of the majority
and concurring opinions in the Nevada Supreme Court: Even
if the State truly forced Riggins to take medication, and even
if this medication deprived Riggins of a protected liberty
interest in a manner actionable in a different legal proceeding, Riggins nonetheless had the fundamentally fair criminal
trial required by the Constitution. I therefore would affirm
his conviction.

I

Riggins contended in the Nevada Supreme Court that he
did not have a " `full and fair' trial" for two reasons, the first
relating to exclusion of evidence of his mental condition and
the second concerning his ability to assist in his defense.
Record 1018. To the extent that Riggins' arguments below
involved federal constitutional issues, I believe that the
Nevada Supreme Court correctly rejected them.

Thomas, J., dissenting

A
Riggins first argued that the trial court improperly pre-vented him from presenting relevant evidence of his demeanor. As the Court notes, Riggins suffers from a mentalillness and raised insanity as a defense at trial. When Riggins killed Wade, he was not using any antipsychotic medica-tion. During his trial, however, Riggins was taking large
doses of the antipsychotic drug Mellaril. Riggins believedthat this drug would make his appearance at trial different
from his appearance when he attacked Wade and that thisdifference might cause the jury to misjudge his sanity. To
show his mental condition as it existed at the time of thecrime, Riggins requested permission to appear before the
jury in an unmedicated state. App. 20-24, 42-47. The trialcourt denied the request, and the Nevada Supreme Court
affirmed.This Court has no power to decide questions concerning
the admissibility of evidence under Nevada law. Estelle v.
McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 67-68 (1991). We therefore may con-duct only a limited review of a Nevada court's decision to

exclude a particular form of demeanor evidence. Except incases involving a violation of a specific constitutional provision such as the Confrontation Clause, see, e. g., Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980), this Court may not reverse a state"trial judge's action in the admission of evidence" unless the

evidentiary ruling "so infuse[s] the trial with unfairness asto deny due process of law." Lisenba v. California, 314
U. S. 219, 228 (1941). See also Marshall v. Lonberger, 459U. S. 422, 438, n. 6 (1983); Burgett v. Texas, 389 U. S. 109,
113-114 (1967). In this case, I see no basis for concludingthat Riggins had less than a full and fair trial.

The Court declines to decide whether Mellaril actually af-fected Riggins' appearance. On the basis of some pretrial
psychiatric testimony it speculates only that Riggins mighthave looked less uptight, drowsy, or confused if he had not
taken the drug. Ante, at 137. Other evidence casts doubt

504us1$70L 04-10-96 12:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT
148 RIGGINS v. NEVADA

Thomas, J., dissenting
on this possibility. At least one psychiatrist believed that ajury would not "be able to notice whether or not [Riggins]

was on Mellaril as compared to the period of the time whenhe was not medicated by that drug." Record 445. Yet,
even if Mellaril noticeably affected Riggins' demeanor, the
Court fails to explain why the medication's effects renderedRiggins' trial fundamentally unfair.

The trial court offered Riggins the opportunity to provehis mental condition as it existed at the time of the crime
through testimony instead of his appearance in court in anunmedicated condition. Riggins took advantage of this offer
by explaining to the jury the history of his mental health,
his usage of Mellaril, and the possible effects of Mellaril on
his demeanor. Id., at 739-740. Riggins also called Dr. Jack
A. Jurasky, a psychiatrist, who testified about Riggins' condition after his arrest and his likely mental state at the time
of the crime. Id., at 747-748. Dr. Jurasky also explained
Riggins' use of Mellaril and how it might be affecting him.
Id., at 752-753, 760-761.

The Nevada Supreme Court concluded that this "testimony was sufficient to inform the jury of the effect of the
Mellaril on Riggins' demeanor and testimony." 107 Nev., at
181, 808 P. 2d, at 538. Its analysis comports with that of
other state courts that also have held that expert testimony
may suffice to clarify the effects of an antipsychotic drug on
a defendant's apparent demeanor. See State v. Law, 270
S. C. 664, 673, 244 S. E. 2d 302, 306 (1978); State v. Jojola, 89
N. M. 489, 493, 553 P. 2d 1296, 1300 (1976). Cf. In re Pray,

conviction because no expert testimony explained how antipsychotic medicine affected the defendant's appearance).
Having reviewed the record as a whole, I see no reason
to disturb the conclusion of the Nevada Supreme Court.
On the facts of this case, Riggins' inability to introduce evidence of his mental condition as he desired did not render
his trial fundamentally unfair. See Rock v. Arkansas, 483

Riggins also argued in the Nevada Supreme Court, al-though not in his briefs to this Court, that he did not have a

" `full and fair' trial" because Mellaril had side effects thatinterfered with his ability to participate in his defense. Record 1018. He alleged, in particular, that the drug tendedto limit his powers of perception. The Court accepts this
contention, stating: "It is clearly possible that such side ef-fects had an impact upon . . . the content of his testimony on
direct or cross examination, his ability to follow the proceed-ings, or the substance of his communication with counsel."
Ante, at 137 (emphasis added). I disagree. We cannot con-clude that Riggins had less than a full and fair trial merely
because of the possibility that Mellaril had side effects.All criminal defendants have a right to a full and fair trial,
and a violation of this right may occur if a State tries a de-fendant who lacks a certain ability to comprehend or participate in the proceedings. We have said that "the Due Proc-ess Clause guarantees the fundamental elements of fairness
in a criminal trial," Spencer v. Texas, 385 U. S. 554, 563-564(1967), and have made clear that "conviction of an accused
person while he is legally incompetent violates due process,"Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S. 375, 378 (1966).

Riggins has no claim of legal incompetence in this case.The trial court specifically found him competent while he
was taking Mellaril under a statute requiring him to have"sufficient mentality to be able to understand the nature of
the criminal charges against him, and . . . to aid and assisthis counsel in the defense interposed upon the trial." Nev.
Rev. Stat. $ 178.400(2) (1989). Riggins does not assert thatdue process imposes a higher standard.

The record does not reveal any other form of unfairnessrelating to the purported side effects of Mellaril. Riggins
has failed to allege specific facts to support his claim that he

Thomas, J., dissenting
could not participate effectively in his defense. He has notstated how he would have directed his counsel to examine or

cross-examine witnesses differently. He has not identifiedany testimony or instructions that he did not understand.
The record, moreover, does not even support his assertionthat Mellaril made him worse off. As Justice Rose noted in
his concurring opinion below: "Two psychiatrists who hadprescribed Mellaril for Riggins, Dr. Quass and Dr. O'Gorman,
testified that they believed it was helpful to him. Additionalpsychiatric testimony established that Mellaril may have increased Riggins' cognitive ability . . . ." 107 Nev., at 185,808 P. 2d, at 540. See also

State v. Hayes, 118 N. H. 458, 461,389 A. 2d 1379, 1381 (1978) (holding a defendant's perception

adequate because "[a]ll the expert evidence support[ed] theconclusion that the medication ha[d] a beneficial effect on
the defendant's ability to function").1 Riggins' competence,moreover, tends to confirm that he had a fair trial. See
State v. Jojola, supra, at 492, 553 P. 2d, at 1299 (presuming,absent other evidence, that the side effects of an antipsychotic drug did not render a competent defendant unable toparticipate fully in his trial). I thus see no basis for reversing the Nevada Supreme Court.

II
Riggins also argues for reversal on the basis of our holdingin Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210, 221 (1990), that the

Due Process Clause protects a substantive "liberty interest"in avoiding unwanted medication. Riggins asserts that Nevada unconstitutionally deprived him of this liberty interestby forcing him to take Mellaril. The Court agrees, ruling

that "the Nevada courts failed to make findings sufficient tosupport forced administration of the drug" in this case.

Ante, at 129. I consider reversal on this basis improper.

A
Riggins may not complain about a deprivation of the lib-erty interest that we recognized in Harper because the record does not support his version of the facts. Shortly afterhis arrest, as the Court notes, Riggins told a psychiatrist at
his jail that he was hearing voices and could not sleep. Thepsychiatrist prescribed Mellaril. When the prescription did
not eliminate the problem, Riggins sought further treatmentand the psychiatrist increased the dosage. Riggins thus
began taking the drug voluntarily. Ante, at 129.The Court concludes that the medication became involuntary when the trial court denied Riggins' motion for permis-sion not to take the drug during the trial.

Ante, at 133. Idisagree. Although the court denied Riggins' motion, it did

not order him to take any medication.2 Moreover, eventhough Riggins alleges that the state physicians forced him
to take the medication after the court's order, the recordcontains no finding of fact with respect to this allegation.
The Court admits that it merely assumes that the physiciansdrugged him, and attempts to justify its assumption by observing that the Nevada Supreme Court also assumed thatinvoluntary medication occurred.

Ibid. The Nevada Su-preme Court, however, may have made its assumption for

the purpose of argument; the assumption, in its view, did

argument:

"QUESTION: . . . [D]id the court ever go further than saying I will not
order the State to stop administering the medication? . . . It simply said
. . . I won't intervene and enjoin the administration of this medication[.]

"MR. YAMPOLSKY: Yes . . . .
"QUESTION: So if [Riggins] had then said, well, I'm not going to take
it, he wouldn't be in violation of the court order? . . .

not change the result of the case. The Court cannot makethe same assumption if it requires reversal of Riggins'

conviction.Riggins also cannot complain about a violation of Harper
because he did not argue below for reversal of his convictionon the ground that Nevada had deprived him of a liberty
interest. Riggins consistently maintained in the Nevadacourts that he did not have a "full and fair trial" because the
medication deprived him of the opportunity to present hisdemeanor to the jury and to participate in his defense. App.
20-24 (trial court motion); id., at 42-47 (trial court reply);Record 1018-1021 (appellate brief);

id., at 1068-1071 (appel-late reply brief). As counsel for Nevada put it at oral argument: "The way this issue was initially presented to the trialcourt was really a question of trial strategy. There was
never an indication in this case that Mr. Riggins was aHarper-type defendant who did not want to be medicated."
Tr. of Oral Arg. 23.3Because the claims that Riggins raised below have no
merit, Riggins has altered his theory of the case. TheCourt, therefore, should not condemn the Nevada courts
because they "did not acknowledge the defendant's libertyinterest in freedom from unwanted antipsychotic drugs."
Ante, at 137. The Nevada courts had no reason to consideran argument that Riggins did not make. We have said quite
recently that "[i]n reviewing the judgments of state courtsunder the jurisdictional grant of 28 U. S. C. $ 1257, the Court
has, with very rare exceptions, refused to consider petition3 Riggins noted in his reply brief before the Nevada Supreme Court that
the courts in United States v. Bryant, 670 F. Supp. 840, 843 (Minn. 1987),
and Bee v. Greaves, 744 F. 2d 1387 (CA10 1984), had recognized a personal
liberty interest in avoiding unwanted medication. Record 1070-1071.
Yet, Riggins never asked for reversal because of a deprivation of this
interest. He argued for reversal in that brief only on grounds that the
medication "violated [his] right to a `full and fair' trial because it denied
him the ability to assist in his defense, and prejudiced his demeanor, attitude, and appearance to the jury." Id., at 1068.

ers' claims that were not raised or addressed below." Yee v.Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 533 (1992). Although "we have

expressed inconsistent views as to whether this rule is juris-dictional or prudential in cases arising from state courts,"
ibid., the Court does not attempt to justify its departurehere.

Finally, we did not grant certiorari to determine whetherthe Nevada courts had made the findings required by

Harperto support forced administration of a drug. We took this

case to decide "[w]hether forced medication during trial vio-lates a defendant's constitutional right to a full and fair
trial." Pet. for Cert. The Court declines to answer thisquestion one way or the other, stating only that a violation
of Harper "may well have impaired the constitutionally pro-tected trial rights Riggins invokes."

Ante, at 137. As wehave stated, "we ordinarily do not consider questions outside

those presented in the petition for certiorari." Yee v. Es-condido, supra, at 535. I believe that we should refuse to
consider Riggins' Harper argument.

B
The Harper issue, in any event, does not warrant rever-sal of Riggins' conviction. The Court correctly states that

Riggins, as a detainee awaiting trial, had at least the sameliberty interest in avoiding unwanted medication that the
inmate had in Harper. This case, however, differs fromHarper in a very significant respect. When the inmate in
Harper complained that physicians were drugging himagainst his will, he sought damages and an injunction against
future medication in a civil action under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983.See 494 U. S., at 217. Although Riggins also complains of
forced medication, he is seeking a reversal of his criminalconviction. I would not expand

Harper to include thisremedy.

We have held that plaintiffs may receive civil remediesfor all manner of constitutional violations under $ 1983. See

154 RIGGINS v. NEVADA

Thomas, J., dissenting
Dennis v. Higgins, 498 U. S. 439, 443-451 (1991). This
Court, however, has reversed criminal convictions only on
the basis of two kinds of constitutional deprivations: those
"which occu[r] during the presentation of the case" to the
trier of fact, and those which cause a "structural defect affecting the framework" of the trial. Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 307, 310 (1991). The Court does not
reveal why it considers a deprivation of a liberty interest in
avoiding unwanted medication to fall into either category of
reversible error. Even if Nevada failed to make the findings
necessary to support forced administration of Mellaril, this
failure, without more, would not constitute a trial error or a
flaw in the trial mechanism. See 107 Nev., at 185, 808 P. 2d,
at 540 (Rose, J., concurring). Although Riggins might be
entitled to other remedies, he has no right to have his conviction reversed.4

4 A State, however, might violate a defendant's due process right to a
fundamentally fair trial if its administration of medication were to diminish substantially the defendant's mental faculties during the trial, even if
he were not thereby rendered incompetent. See 3 E. Coke, Institutes *34
(1797) ("If felons come in judgement to answer, . . . they shall be out of
irons, and all manner of bonds, so that their pain shall not take away any
manner of reason, nor them constrain to answer, but at their free will");
Resolutions of the Judges upon the Case of the Regicides, Kelyng's Report
of Divers Cases in Pleas of the Crown 10 (1708) (Old Bailey 1660) ("It was
resolved that when Prisoners come to the Bar to be tryed, their Irons
ought to be taken off, so that they be not in any Torture while they make
their defense, be their Crime never so great"), reprinted in 5 How. St. Tr.
971, 979-980 (1816); Trial of Christopher Layer, 16 How. St. Tr. 94, 100
(1812) [K. B. 1722] ("[T]he authority is that [the defendant] is not to be `in
vinculis' during his trial, but should be so far free, that he should have the
use of his reason, and all advantages to clear his innocence"); see also State
v. Williams, 18 Wash. 47, 49-51, 50 P. 580, 581 (1897) (" `[T]he condition of
the prisoner in shackles may, to some extent, deprive him of the free and
calm use of all his faculties' ") (quoting State v. Kring, 64 Mo. 591 (1877)).
Riggins has not made (much less proved) any such allegation in this Court;
indeed, the record indicates that Riggins' mental capacity was enhanced
by his administration of Mellaril.

Thomas, J., dissenting
We applied a similar analysis in Estelle v. Williams, 425U. S. 501 (1976). In that case, a prisoner challenged his conviction on grounds that the State had required him to wearprison garb before the jury. In reviewing the challenge, we
did not ask whether the State had violated some personal
right of the defendant to select his attire. Instead, we con-sidered only whether the prison clothing had denied him a

"fair trial" by making his appearance less favorable to thejury.

Id., at 503. Although we ultimately declined to reach
the merits because the prisoner had waived the issue at trial,
id., at 512, we observed that lower courts had held that "a
showing of actual prejudice must be made by a defendant
seeking to have his conviction overturned on this ground,"
id., at 504, n. 1. In my view, just as the validity of the conviction in Estelle v. Williams would depend on whether the
prisoner had a fair trial, so does the validity of Riggins'
conviction.

The need for requiring actual unfairness in this case
(either in the form of a structural defect or an error in the
presentation of evidence) becomes apparent when one considers how the Court might apply its decision to other cases.
A State could violate Harper by forcibly administering any
kind of medication to a criminal defendant. Yet, the Court
surely would not reverse a criminal conviction for a Harper
violation involving medications such as penicillin or aspirin.
Perhaps Mellaril, in general, has a greater likelihood of affecting a person's appearance and powers of perceptions than
these substances. As noted above, however, we have no indication in this case, considering the record as a whole, that
Mellaril unfairly prejudiced Riggins.

I do not mean in any way to undervalue the importance of
a person's liberty interest in avoiding forced medication or
to suggest that States may drug detainees at their whim.
Under Harper, detainees have an interest in avoiding unwanted medication that the States must respect. In appropriate instances, detainees may seek damages or injunctions

against further medication in civil actions either under$ 1983, as in Harper, or under state law. Yet, when this

Court reviews a state-court criminal conviction of a defend-ant who has taken medication, it cannot undo any violation
that already has occurred or punish those responsible. Itmay determine only whether the defendant received a
proper trial, free of the kinds of reversible errors that wehave recognized. Because Riggins had a full and fair trial
in this case, I would affirm the Nevada Supreme Court.

C
For the foregoing reasons, I find it unnecessary to addressthe precise standards governing the forced administration of

drugs to persons such as Riggins. Whether or not Nevadaviolated these standards, I would affirm Riggins' conviction.
I note, however, that the Court's discussion of these stand-ards poses troubling questions. Although the Court purports to rely on Washington v. Harper, the standards that itapplies in this case differ in several respects.

The Court today, for instance, appears to adopt a standardof strict scrutiny. It specifically faults the trial court for
failing to find either that the "continued administration ofMellaril was

required to ensure that the defendant could betried,"
ante, at 136 (emphasis added), or that "other compel-ling concerns outweighed Riggins' interest in freedom from

unwanted antipsychotic drugs," ibid. (emphasis added).We specifically rejected this high standard of review in
Harper. In that case, the Washington Supreme Court hadheld that state physicians could not administer medication
to a prisoner without showing that it "was both necessaryand effective for furthering a compelling state interest."
494 U. S., at 218. We reversed, holding that the state court"erred in refusing to apply the standard of reasonableness."
Id., at 223.The Court today also departs from

Harper when it saysthat the Nevada Supreme Court erred by not "considering

less intrusive alternatives." Ante, at 135. The Court pre-sumably believes that Nevada could have treated Riggins

with smaller doses of Mellaril or with other kinds of thera-pies. In Harper, however, we imposed no such requirement.
In fact, we specifically ruled that "[t]he alternative meansproffered by [the prisoner] for accommodating his interest in
rejecting the forced administration of antipsychotic drugs donot demonstrate the invalidity of the State's policy." 494
U. S., at 226.This case differs from

Harper because it involves a pretrialdetainee and not a convicted prisoner. The standards for

forcibly medicating inmates well may differ from those forpersons awaiting trial. The Court, however, does not rely
on this distinction in departing from Harper; instead, it pur-ports to be applying

Harper to detainees. Ante, at 135.Either the Court is seeking to change the Harper standards

or it is adopting different standards for detainees withoutstating its reasons. I cannot accept either interpretation of
the Court's opinion. For all of these reasons, I respectfullydissent.

Syllabus

WYATT v. COLE et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 91-126. Argued January 14, 1992--Decided May 18, 1992
With the assistance of respondent Robbins, an attorney, respondent Cole

filed a complaint under the Mississippi replevin statute against his partner, petitioner Wyatt. After Cole refused to comply with a state court
order to return to Wyatt property seized under the statute, Wyatt
brought suit in the Federal District Court under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, challenging the state statute's constitutionality and seeking injunctive relief
and damages. Among other things, the court held the statute unconstitutional and assumed that Cole was subject to liability under Lugar
v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922, in which this Court ruled that private defendants invoking state replevin, garnishment, and attachment
statutes later declared unconstitutional act under color of state law
for $ 1983 liability purposes. The court also intimated that, but did
not decide whether, Robbins was subject to $ 1983 liability. However,
Lugar had left open the question whether private defendants are entitled to qualified immunity from suit in such cases, see id., at 942, n. 23,
and the District Court held that respondents were entitled to qualified
immunity at least for conduct arising prior to the replevin statute's
invalidation. The Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of qualified immunity to respondents without revisiting the question of their $ 1983
liability.

Held:

1. Qualified immunity from suit, as enunciated by this Court with
respect to government officials, is not available to private defendants
charged with $ 1983 liability for invoking state replevin, garnishment,
or attachment statutes. Immunity for private defendants was not so
firmly rooted in the common law and was not supported by such strong
policy reasons as to create an inference that Congress meant to incorporate it into $ 1983. See, e. g., Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U. S.
622, 637. Even if there were sufficient common law support to conclude that private defendants should be entitled to a good faith and/or
probable cause defense to suits for unjustified harm arising out of the
misuse of governmental processes, that would still not entitle respondents to what they obtained in the courts below: the type of objectively
determined, immediately appealable, qualified immunity from suit accorded government officials under, e. g., Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S.

Opinion of the Court
800, and Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511. Moreover, the policy concerns mandating qualified immunity for officials in such cases--the need
to preserve the officials' ability to perform their discretionary functions
and to ensure that talented candidates not be deterred by the threat
of damages suits from entering public service--are not applicable to
private parties. Although it may be that private defendants faced
with $ 1983 liability under Lugar, supra, could be entitled to an affirmative good faith defense, or that $ 1983 suits against private, rather
than governmental, parties could require plaintiffs to carry additional
burdens, those issues are neither before the Court nor decided here.
Pp. 163-169.

2. On remand, it must be determined, at least, whether respondents,
in invoking the replevin statute, acted under color of state law within
the meaning of Lugar, supra. P. 169.

In Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922 (1982), weleft open the question whether private defendants charged

I
This dispute arises out of a soured cattle partnership. InJuly 1986, respondent Bill Cole sought to dissolve his partnership with petitioner Howard Wyatt. When no agree-ment could be reached, Cole, with the assistance of an

Opinion of the Court
attorney, respondent John Robbins II, filed a state court
complaint in replevin against Wyatt, accompanied by a replevin bond of $18,000.

At that time, Mississippi law provided that an individual
could obtain a court order for seizure of property possessed
by another by posting a bond and swearing to a state court
that the applicant was entitled to that property and that the
adversary "wrongfully took and detain[ed] or wrongfully detain[ed]" the property. 1975 Miss. Gen. Laws, ch. 508, $ 1.
The statute gave the judge no discretion to deny a writ of
replevin.

After Cole presented a complaint and bond, the court ordered the county sheriff to seize 24 head of cattle, a tractor,
and certain other personal property from Wyatt. Several
months later, after a postseizure hearing, the court dismissed
Cole's complaint in replevin and ordered the property returned to Wyatt. When Cole refused to comply, Wyatt
brought suit in Federal District Court, challenging the constitutionality of the statute and seeking injunctive relief and
damages from respondents, the county sheriff, and the deputies involved in the seizure.

The District Court held that the statute's failure to afford
judges discretion to deny writs of replevin violated due process. 710 F. Supp. 180, 183 (SD Miss. 1989).1 It dismissed
the suit against the government officials involved in the seizure on the ground that they were entitled to qualified immunity. App. 17-18. The court also held that Cole and Robbins, even if otherwise liable under $ 1983, were entitled to
qualified immunity from suit for conduct arising prior to the
statute's invalidation. Id., at 12-14. The Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the District Court's grant of
qualified immunity to the private defendants. 928 F. 2d

Opinion of the Court
We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 807 (1991), to resolve aconflict among the Courts of Appeals over whether private

defendants threatened with 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 liability are,like certain government officials, entitled to qualified immunity from suit. Like the Fifth Circuit, the Eighth and Elev-enth Circuits have determined that private defendants are
entitled to qualified immunity. See Buller v. Buechler, 706F. 2d 844, 850-852 (CA8 1983);

Jones v. Preuit & Mauldin,851 F. 2d 1321, 1323-1325 (CA11 1988) (en banc), vacated on

other grounds, 489 U. S. 1002 (1989). The First and NinthCircuits, however, have held that in certain circumstances,
private parties acting under color of state law are not enti-tled to such an immunity. See

Downs v. Sawtelle, 574 F. 2d1, 15-16 (CA1), cert. denied, 439 U. S. 910 (1978); Conner v.

Santa Ana, 897 F. 2d 1487, 1492, n. 9 (CA9), cert. denied, 498U. S. 816 (1990); Howerton v. Gabica, 708 F. 2d 380, 385, n. 10
(CA9 1983). The Sixth Circuit has rejected qualified immu-nity for private defendants sued under $ 1983 but has established a good faith defense. Duncan v. Peck, 844 F. 2d1261 (1988).

II
Title 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 provides a cause of action against"[e]very person who, under color of any statute . . . of any

State . . . subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen . . .to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities
secured by the Constitution and laws . . . ." The purpose of$ 1983 is to deter state actors from using the badge of their
authority to deprive individuals of their federally guaranteedrights and to provide relief to victims if such deterrence fails.
Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 254-257 (1978).In

Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., supra, the Court consid-ered the scope of $ 1983 liability in the context of garnishment, prejudgment attachment, and replevin statutes. Inthat case, the Court held that private parties who attached
a debtor's assets pursuant to a state attachment statute weresubject to $ 1983 liability if the statute was constitutionally

162 WYATT v. COLE

Opinion of the Court
infirm. Noting that our garnishment, prejudgment attachment, and replevin cases established that private use of state
laws to secure property could constitute "state action" for
purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, id., at 932-935, the
Court held that private defendants invoking a state-created
attachment statute act "under color of state law" within the
meaning of $ 1983 if their actions are "fairly attributable to
the State," id., at 937. This requirement is satisfied, the
Court held, if two conditions are met. First, the "deprivation must be caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the State or by a rule of conduct imposed by
the State or by a person for whom the State is responsible."
Ibid. Second, the private party must have "acted together
with or . . . obtained significant aid from state officials" or
engaged in conduct "otherwise chargeable to the State."
Ibid. The Court found potential $ 1983 liability in Lugar because the attachment scheme was created by the State and
because the private defendants, in invoking the aid of state
officials to attach the disputed property, were "willful participant[s] in joint activity with the State or its agents." Id.,
at 941 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Citing Lugar, the District Court assumed that Cole, by
invoking the state statute, had acted under color of state law
within the meaning of $ 1983, and was therefore liable for
damages for the deprivation of Wyatt's due process rights.
App. 12. With respect to Robbins, the court noted that
while an action taken by an attorney in representing a client

Robbins was liable, however, because it held that both Cole
and Robbins were entitled to qualified immunity from suit
at least for conduct prior to the statute's invalidation. Id.,

Opinion of the Court
Although the Court of Appeals did not review whether, inthe first instance, Cole and Robbins had acted under color of

state law within the meaning of $ 1983, it affirmed the Dis-trict Court's grant of qualified immunity to respondents. In
so doing, the Court of Appeals followed one of its prior cases,
Folsom Investment Co. v. Moore, 681 F. 2d 1032 (CA5 1982),in which it held that "a $ 1983 defendant who has invoked an

attachment statute is entitled to an immunity from monetaryliability so long as he neither knew nor reasonably should
have known that the statute was unconstitutional." Id., at1037. The court in Folsom based its holding on two
grounds. First, it viewed the existence of a common law,probable cause defense to the torts of malicious prosecution
and wrongful attachment as evidence that "Congress in en-acting $ 1983 could not have intended to subject to liability
those who in good faith resorted to legal process." Id., at1038. Although it acknowledged that a defense is not the
same as an immunity, the court maintained that it could"transfor[m] a common law defense extant at the time of

$ 1983's passage into an immunity." Ibid. Second, thecourt held that while immunity for private parties is not derived from official immunity, it is based on "the importantpublic interest in permitting ordinary citizens to rely on presumptively valid state laws, in shielding citizens from mone-tary damages when they reasonably resort to a legal process
later held to be unconstitutional, and in protecting a privatecitizen from liability when his role in any unconstitutional
action is marginal." Id., at 1037. In defending the decisionbelow, respondents advance both arguments put forward by
the Court of Appeals in Folsom. Neither is availing.

Section 1983 "creates a species of tort liability that on itsface admits of no immunities." Imbler v. Pachtman, 424

U. S. 409, 417 (1976). Nonetheless, we have accorded cer-tain government officials either absolute or qualified immu504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
nity from suit if the "tradition of immunity was so firmlyrooted in the common law and was supported by such strong

policy reasons that `Congress would have specifically so pro-vided had it wished to abolish the doctrine.' "

Owen v. City
of Independence, 445 U. S. 622, 637 (1980) (quoting Pierson
v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 555 (1967)). If parties seeking immu-nity were shielded from tort liability when Congress enacted

the Civil Rights Act of 1871--$ 1 of which is codified at 42U. S. C. $ 1983--we infer from legislative silence that Congress did not intend to abrogate such immunities when itimposed liability for actions taken under color of state law.
See Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S. 914, 920 (1984); Imbler, supra,
at 421; Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U. S. 522, 529 (1984). Additionally, irrespective of the common law support, we will not
recognize an immunity available at common law if $ 1983's
history or purpose counsel against applying it in $ 1983
actions. Tower, supra, at 920. See also Imbler, supra, at
424-429.

In determining whether there was an immunity at common law that Congress intended to incorporate in the Civil
Rights Act, we look to the most closely analogous torts--in
this case, malicious prosecution and abuse of process. At
common law, these torts provided causes of action against
private defendants for unjustified harm arising out of the
misuse of governmental processes. 2 C. Addison, Law of
Torts || 852, and n. 2, || 868, and n. 1 (1876); T. Cooley, Law
of Torts 187-190 (1879); J. Bishop, Commentaries on NonContract Law $$ 228-250, pp. 91-103, $ 490, p. 218 (1889).

Respondents do not contend that private parties who instituted attachment proceedings and who were subsequently
sued for malicious prosecution or abuse of process were entitled to absolute immunity. And with good reason; although
public prosecutors and judges were accorded absolute immunity at common law, Imbler v. Pachtman, supra, at 421-424,
such protection did not extend to complaining witnesses who,
like respondents, set the wheels of government in motion by

Opinion of the Court
instigating a legal action. Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335,340-341 (1986) ("In 1871, the generally accepted rule was

that one who procured the issuance of an arrest warrant bysubmitting a complaint could be held liable if the complaint
was made maliciously and without probable cause").

Nonetheless, respondents argue that at common law, pri-vate defendants could defeat a malicious prosecution or

abuse of process action if they acted without malice and withprobable cause, and that we should therefore infer that Congress did not intend to abrogate such defenses when it en-acted the Civil Rights Act of 1871. We adopted similar reasoning in Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S., at 555-557. There, we
held that police officers sued for false arrest under $ 1983
were entitled to the defense that they acted with probable
cause and in good faith when making an arrest under a statute they reasonably believed was valid. We recognized this
defense because peace officers were accorded protection from
liability at common law if they arrested an individual in good
faith, even if the innocence of such person were later established. Ibid.

The rationale we adopted in Pierson is of no avail to respondents here. Even if there were sufficient common law
support to conclude that respondents, like the police officers
in Pierson, should be entitled to a good faith defense, that
would still not entitle them to what they sought and obtained
in the courts below: the qualified immunity from suit accorded government officials under Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457
U. S. 800 (1982).

In Harlow, we altered the standard of qualified immunity
adopted in our prior $ 1983 cases because we recognized that
"[t]he subjective element of the good-faith defense frequently
[had] prove[d] incompatible with our admonition . . . that
insubstantial claims should not proceed to trial." Id., at
815-816. Because of the attendant harms to government effectiveness caused by lengthy judicial inquiry into subjective
motivation, we concluded that "bare allegations of malice

504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT
166 WYATT v. COLE

Opinion of the Court
should not suffice to subject government officials either tothe costs of trial or to the burdens of broad-reaching discovery." Id., at 817-818. Accordingly, we held that gov-ernment officials performing discretionary functions are
shielded from "liability for civil damages insofar as their con-duct [did] not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would haveknown."

Id., at 818. This wholly objective standard, weconcluded, would "avoid excessive disruption of government

and permit the resolution of many insubstantial claims onsummary judgment." Ibid.

That Harlow "completely reformulated qualified immunityalong principles not at all embodied in the common law,"

An-derson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 645 (1987), was reinforced

by our decision in Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511 (1985).Mitchell held that Harlow established an "immunity from
suit rather than a mere defense to liability," which, like anabsolute immunity, "is effectively lost if a case is erroneously
permitted to go to trial." 472 U. S., at 526 (emphasis sup-plied). Thus, we held in

Mitchell that the denial of qualifiedimmunity should be immediately appealable. Id., at 530.

It is this type of objectively determined, immediately ap-pealable immunity that respondents asserted below.

2 But,

2 In arguing that respondents are entitled to qualified immunity under
Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800 (1982), the dissent mixes apples and
oranges. Even if we were to agree with the dissent's proposition that
elements a plaintiff was required to prove as part of her case in chief could
somehow be construed as a " `defense,' " post, at 176, n. 1, and that this
"defense" entitles private citizens to some protection from liability, we
cannot agree that respondents are entitled to immunity from suit under
Harlow. One could reasonably infer from the fact that a plaintiff's malicious prosecution or abuse of process action failed if she could not affirmatively establish both malice and want of probable cause that plaintiffs
bringing an analogous suit under $ 1983 should be required to make a
similar showing to sustain a $ 1983 cause of action. Alternatively, if one
accepts the dissent's characterization of the common law as establishing
an affirmative "defense" for private defendants, then one could also conclude that private parties sued under $ 1983 should likewise be entitled to

167Cite as: 504 U. S. 158 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
as our precedents make clear, the reasons for recognizingsuch an immunity were based not simply on the existence of

a good faith defense at common law, but on the special policyconcerns involved in suing government officials.

Harlow,
supra, at 813; Mitchell, supra, at 526. Reviewing these concerns, we conclude that the rationales mandating qualifiedimmunity for public officials are not applicable to private

parties.Qualified immunity strikes a balance between compensating those who have been injured by official conduct andprotecting government's ability to perform its traditional
functions. Harlow, supra, at 819; Pierson, supra, at 554;
Anderson, supra, at 638. Accordingly, we have recognized
qualified immunity for government officials where it was necessary to preserve their ability to serve the public good orto ensure that talented candidates were not deterred by the

threat of damages suits from entering public service. See,
e. g., Wood v. Strickland, 420 U. S. 308, 319 (1975) (denial of
qualified immunity to school board officials " `would contribute not to principled and fearless decision-making but to intimidation' ") (quoting Pierson, supra, at 554); Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478, 506 (1978) (immunity for Presidential
aides warranted partly "to protect officials who are required
to exercise their discretion and the related public interest
in encouraging the vigorous exercise of official authority");
Mitchell, supra, at 526 (immunity designed to prevent the
" `distraction of officials from their governmental duties, inhibition of discretionary action, and deterrence of able people
from public service' " (quoting Harlow, supra, at 816)). In

assert an affirmative defense based on a similar showing of good faith and/
or probable cause. In neither case, however, is it appropriate to make
the dissent's leap: that because these common law torts partially included
an objective component--probable cause--private defendants sued under

$ 1983 should be entitled to the objectively determined, immediately
appealable immunity from suit accorded certain government officials
under Harlow.

168 WYATT v. COLE

Opinion of the Court
short, the qualified immunity recognized in Harlow acts tosafeguard government, and thereby to protect the public at

large, not to benefit its agents.These rationales are not transferable to private parties.
Although principles of equality and fairness may suggest, as
respondents argue, that private citizens who rely unsus-pectingly on state laws they did not create and may have no

reason to believe are invalid should have some protectionfrom liability, as do their government counterparts, such interests are not sufficiently similar to the traditional purposesof qualified immunity to justify such an expansion. Unlike
school board members, see Wood, supra, or police officers,
see Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335 (1986), or Presidential
aides, see Butz, supra, private parties hold no office requiring them to exercise discretion; nor are they principally concerned with enhancing the public good. Accordingly, extending Harlow qualified immunity to private parties would
have no bearing on whether public officials are able to act
forcefully and decisively in their jobs or on whether qualified applicants enter public service. Moreover, unlike with
government officials performing discretionary functions, the
public interest will not be unduly impaired if private individuals are required to proceed to trial to resolve their legal
disputes. In short, the nexus between private parties and
the historic purposes of qualified immunity is simply too
attenuated to justify such an extension of our doctrine of
immunity.

For these reasons, we can offer no relief today. The question on which we granted certiorari is a very narrow one:
"[W]hether private persons, who conspire with state officials
to violate constitutional rights, have available the good faith
immunity applicable to public officials." Pet. for Cert. i.
The precise issue encompassed in this question, and the only
issue decided by the lower courts, is whether qualified immunity, as enunciated in Harlow, is available for private defendants faced with $ 1983 liability for invoking a state replevin,

garnishment, or attachment statute. That answer is no. Inso holding, however, we do not foreclose the possibility that

private defendants faced with $ 1983 liability under Lugar v.Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922 (1982), could be entitled to
an affirmative defense based on good faith and/or probablecause or that $ 1983 suits against private, rather than governmental, parties could require plaintiffs to carry additionalburdens. Because those issues are not fairly before us, however, we leave them for another day. Cf. Yee v. Escondido,503 U. S., 519, 534-538 (1992).

IV
As indicated above, the District Court assumed that underLugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., supra, Cole was liable under

$ 1983 for invoking the state replevin under bond statute,and intimated that, but did not decide whether, Robbins also
was subject to $ 1983 liability. The Court of Appeals neverrevisited this question, but instead concluded only that respondents were entitled to qualified immunity at least forconduct prior to the statute's invalidation. Because we
overturn this judgment, we must remand, since there re-mains to be determined, at least, whether Cole and Robbins,
in invoking the replevin statute, acted under color of statelaw within the meaning of

Lugar. The judgment of theCourt of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for

proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Scalia joins,concurring.
I join the opinion of the Court but find that a further andseparate statement of my views is required.
I agree with what The Chief Justice writes in dissentrespecting the historical origins of our qualified immunity
jurisprudence but submit that the question presented to usrequires that we reverse the judgment, as the majority
holds. Indeed, the result reached by the Court is quite con504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT

sistent, in my view, with a proper application of the history
The Chief Justice relates.

Both the Court and the dissent recognize that our originaldecisions recognizing defenses and immunities to suits

brought under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 rely on analogous limitations
existing in the common law when $ 1983 was enacted. See
ante, at 163-164; post, at 176-177. In Tenney v. Brandhove,
341 U. S. 367, 376 (1951), we held that $ 1983 had not eradi-cated the absolute immunity granted legislators under the

common law. And in Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 555-557(1967), we recognized that under $ 1983 police officers sued
for false arrest had available what we described as a "defense of good faith and probable cause," based on their reasonable belief that the statute under which they acted was
constitutional. Id., at 557. Pierson allowed the defense
because with respect to the analogous common-law tort,
the Court decided that officers had available to them a
similar defense. The good-faith and probable-cause defense
evolved into our modern qualified-immunity doctrine. Ante,
at 165-166.

Our immunity doctrine is rooted in historical analogy,
based on the existence of common-law rules in 1871, rather
than in "freewheeling policy choice[s]." Malley v. Briggs,
475 U. S. 335, 342 (1986). In cases involving absolute immunity we adhere to that view, granting immunity to the extent
consistent with historical practice. Ibid.; Burns v. Reed, 500
U. S. 478, 485 (1991); Hafer v. Melo, 502 U. S. 21, 28-29 (1991).

In the context of qualified immunity for public officials, however, we have diverged to a substantial degree from the historical standards. In Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800
(1982), we "completely reformulated qualified immunity
along principles not at all embodied in the common law,
replacing the inquiry into subjective malice so frequently
required at common law with an objective inquiry into the
legal reasonableness of the official action." Anderson v.
Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 645 (1987). The transformation

was justified by the special policy concerns arising from pub-lic officials' exposure to repeated suits.

Harlow, supra, at
813-814; ante, at 165-166. The dissent in today's case ar-gues that similar considerations justify a transformation of

common-law standards in the context of private-party defendants. Post, at 179-180. With this I cannot agree.We need not decide whether or not it was appropriate for

the Court in Harlow to depart from history in the name ofpublic policy, reshaping immunity doctrines in light of those
policy considerations. But I would not extend that approachto other contexts.

Harlow was decided at a time when the
standards applicable to summary judgment made it difficult
for a defendant to secure summary judgment regarding a
factual question such as subjective intent, even when the
plaintiff bore the burden of proof on the question; and in
Harlow we relied on that fact in adopting an objective standard for qualified immunity. 457 U. S., at 815-819. However, subsequent clarifications to summary-judgment law
have alleviated that problem, by allowing summary judgment to be entered against a nonmoving party "who fails to
make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an
element essential to that party's case, and on which that
party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp.
v. Catrett, 477 U. S. 317, 322 (1986). Under the principles
set forth in Celotex and related cases, the strength of factual
allegations such as subjective bad faith can be tested at the
summary-judgment stage.

It must be remembered that unlike the common-law
judges whose doctrines we adopt, we are devising limitations
to a remedial statute, enacted by the Congress, which "on its
face does not provide for any immunities." Malley, supra,
at 342 (emphasis in original). We have imported commonlaw doctrines in the past because of our conclusion that the
Congress which enacted $ 1983 acted in light of existing legal
principles. Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U. S. 622,
637-638 (1980). That suggests, however, that we may not

Kennedy, J., concurring
transform what existed at common law based on our notionsof policy or efficiency.

My conclusions are a mere consequence of the historicalprinciples described in the dissent of

The Chief Justice.
The common-law tort actions most analogous to the action
commenced here were malicious prosecution and abuse ofprocess.

Post, at 176. In both of the common-law actions,
it was essential for the plaintiff to prove that the wrongdoeracted with malice and without probable cause.

Post, at 176,
n. 1. As The Chief Justice states, it is something of amisnomer to describe the common law as creating a goodfaith defense; we are in fact concerned with the essence of
the wrong itself, with the essential elements of the tort.
The malice element required the plaintiff to show that the
challenged action was undertaken with an unlawful purpose,
though it did not require a showing of ill will towards the
plaintiff. J. Bishop, Commentaries on Non-Contract Law

$ 232, p. 92 (1889). To establish the absence of probable
cause, a plaintiff was required to prove that a reasonable
person, knowing what the defendant did, would not have believed that the prosecution or suit was well grounded, or that
the defendant had in fact acted with the belief that the suit
or prosecution in question was without probable cause. Id.,

$ 239, at 95. Our cases on the subject, beginning with Harlow v. Fitzgerald, diverge from the common law in two ways.
First, as The Chief Justice acknowledges, modern qualified immunity does not turn upon the subjective belief of
the defendant. Post, at 178, n. 2. Second, the immunity
diverges from the common-law model by requiring the defendant, not the plaintiff, to bear the burden of proof on the
probable-cause issue. Supra this page.

The decision to impose these requirements under a rule
of immunity has implications, though, well beyond a mere
determination that one party or the other is in a better position to bear the burden of proof. It implicates as well the
law's definition of the wrong itself. At common law the ac504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT

173Cite as: 504 U. S. 158 (1992)
Kennedy, J., concurring
tion lay because the essence of the wrong was an injurycaused by a suit or prosecution commenced without probable

cause or with knowledge that it was baseless. To cast theissue in terms of immunity, however, is to imply that a wrong
was committed but that it cannot be redressed. The difference is fundamental, for at stake is the concept of what soci-ety considers proper conduct and what it does not. Beneath

the nomenclature lie considerations of substance.

Harlow was cast as an immunity case, involving as it did
suit against officers of the Government. And immunity, asdistinct, say, from a defense on the merits or an element of

the plaintiff 's cause of action, is a legal inquiry, decided by
the court rather than a jury, and on which an interlocutory
appeal is available to defendants. Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472
U. S. 511 (1985). Whether or not it is correct to diverge in
these respects from the common-law model when governmental agents are the defendants, we ought not to adopt an
automatic rule that the same analysis applies in suits against
private persons. See ante, at 166-167, n. 2. By casting the
rule as an immunity, we imply the underlying conduct was
unlawful, a most debatable proposition in a case where a
private citizen may have acted in good-faith reliance upon
a statute. And as we have defined the immunity, we also
eliminate from the case any demonstration of subjective good
faith. Under the common law, however, if the plaintiff could
prove subjective bad faith on the part of the defendant, he
had gone far towards proving both malice and lack of probable cause. Moreover, the question of the defendant's beliefs
was almost always one for the jury. Stewart v. Sonneborn,
98 U. S. 187, 194 (1879).

It is true that good faith may be difficult to establish in
the face of a showing that from an objective standpoint no
reasonable person could have acted as the defendant did, and
in many cases the result would be the same under either
test. This is why Stewart describes the instances where the
probable cause turns on subjective intent as the exceptional

174 WYATT v. COLE

Kennedy, J., concurring
case. Ibid.; post, at 178, n. 2. That does not mean, how-ever, that we may deprive plaintiffs of the opportunity to

make their case. In some cases eliminating the defensebased on subjective good faith can make a real difference,
and again the instant case of alleged reliance on a statute
deemed valid provides the example. It seems problematicto say that a defendant should be relieved of liability under

some automatic rule of immunity if objective reliance upon astatute is reasonable but the defendant in fact had knowledge of its invalidity. Because the burden of proof on thisquestion is the plaintiff 's, the question may be resolved on
summary judgment if the plaintiff cannot come forward with
facts from which bad faith can be inferred. But the question
is a factual one, and a plaintiff may rely on circumstantial
rather than direct evidence to make his case. Siegert v.
Gilley, 500 U. S. 226, 236 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring in
judgment). The rule, of course, also works in reverse, for
the existence of a statute thought valid ought to allow a defendant to argue that he acted in subjective good faith and is
entitled to exoneration no matter what the objective test is.

The distinction I draw is important because there is support in the common law for the proposition that a private
individual's reliance on a statute, prior to a judicial determination of unconstitutionality, is considered reasonable as a
matter of law; and therefore under the circumstances of this
case, lack of probable cause can only be shown through proof
of subjective bad faith. Birdsall v. Smith, 158 Mich. 390,
394, 122 N. W. 626, 627 (1909). Thus the subjective element
dismissed as exceptional by the dissent may be the rule
rather than the exception.

I join the opinion of the Court because I believe there is
nothing contrary to what I say in that opinion. See ante,
at 169 ("[W]e do not foreclose the possibility that private
defendants faced with $ 1983 liability . . . could be entitled to

cause or that $ 1983 suits against private . . . parties could

require plaintiffs to carry additional burdens"). Thoughthey described the issue before them as "good-faith immunity," both the District Court and the Court of Appealstreated the question as one of law. App. 12-14; 928 F. 2d
718, 721-722 (CA5 1991). The Court of Appeals in particular
placed heavy reliance on the policy considerations favoring arule that citizens may rely on statutes presumed to be valid.

Ibid. The latter inquiry, as Birdsall recognizes, however,goes mainly to the question of objective reasonableness. I
do not understand either the District Court or the Court ofAppeals to make an unequivocal finding that the respondents
before us acted with subjective good faith when they filedsuit under the Mississippi replevin statute. Furthermore,
the question on which we granted certiorari was the narrow
one whether private defendants in $ 1983 suits are entitled
to the same qualified immunity applicable to public officials,
ante, at 168, which of course would be subject to the objective standard of Harlow v. Fitzgerald. Under my view the
answer to that question is no. Though it might later be determined that there is no triable issue of fact to save the
plaintiff 's case in the matter now before us, on remand it
ought to be open to him at least in theory to argue that the
defendants' bad faith eliminates any reliance on the statute,
just as it ought to be open to the defendants to show good
faith even if some construct of a reasonable person in the
defendants' position would have acted in a different way.

So I agree the case must be remanded for further
proceedings.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Souter
and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The Court notes that we have recognized an immunity in
the $ 1983 context in two circumstances. The first is when
a similarly situated defendant would have enjoyed an immunity at common law at the time $ 1983 was adopted. Ante,
at 163-164. The second is when important public policy con504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
cerns suggest the need for an immunity. Ante, at 166-167.Because I believe that both requirements, as explained in

our prior decisions, are satisfied here, I dissent.First, I think it is clear that at the time $ 1983 was
adopted, there generally was available to private parties agood-faith defense to the torts of malicious prosecution and
abuse of process.1 See authorities cited ante, at 164; Malleyv.

Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 340-341 (1986) (noting that the gen-erally accepted rule at common law was that a person would

be held liable if "the complaint was made maliciously andwithout probable cause"); Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 555
(1967) (noting that at common law a police officer sued forfalse arrest can rely on his own good faith in making the
arrest). And while the Court is willing to assume as much,
ante, at 165, it thinks this insufficient to sustain respondents'claim to an immunity because the "qualified immunity" respondents' seek is not equivalent to such a "defense," ante,at 165-166.

But I think the Court errs in suggesting that the availabil-ity of a good-faith common-law defense at the time of $ 1983's
adoption is not sufficient to support their claim to immunity.The case on which respondents principally rely,

Pierson, con-sidered whether a police officer sued under $ 1983 for false

arrest could rely on a showing of good faith in order to es-cape liability. And while this Court concluded that the officer could rely on his own good faith, based in large part onthe fact that a good-faith defense had been available at common law, the Court was at best ambiguous as to whether it

1 Describing the common law as providing a "defense" is something of a
misnomer--under the common law it was plaintiff's burden to establish as
elements of the tort both that the defendant acted with malice and without
probable cause. T. Cooley, Law of Torts 184-185 (1879); J. Bishop, Commentaries on Non-Contract Law $ 225, p. 90 (1889). Referring to the defendant as having a good-faith defense is a useful shorthand for capturing
plaintiff's burden and the related notion that a defendant could avoid liability by establishing either a lack of malice or the presence of probable
cause.

was recognizing a "defense" or an "immunity." Compare386 U. S., at 556 (criticizing Court of Appeals for concluding

that no "immunity" was available), with id., at 557 (recogniz-ing a good-faith "defense"). Any initial ambiguity, however,
has certainly been eliminated by subsequent cases; there can
be no doubt that it is a qualified immunity to which the offi-cer is entitled. See

Malley, supra, at 340. Similarly, in
Wood v. Strickland, 420 U. S. 308, 318 (1975), we recognizedthat, "[a]lthough there have been differing emphases and formulations of the common-law immunity," the general recog-nition under state law that public officers are entitled to a
good-faith defense was sufficient to support the recognition
of a $ 1983 immunity.

Thus, unlike the Court, I think our prior precedent establishes that a demonstration that a good-faith defense was
available at the time $ 1983 was adopted does, in fact, provide
substantial support for a contemporary defendant claiming
that he is entitled to qualified immunity in the analogous

$ 1983 context. While we refuse to recognize a common-law
immunity if $ 1983's history or purpose counsel against applying it, ante, at 164, I see no such history or purpose that
would so counsel here.

Indeed, I am at a loss to understand what is accomplished
by today's decision--other than a needlessly fastidious adherence to nomenclature--given that the Court acknowledges that a good-faith defense will be available for respondents to assert on remand. Respondents presumably will be
required to show the traditional elements of a good-faith
defense--either that they acted without malice or that
they acted with probable cause. See n. 1, supra; Stewart
v. Sonneborn, 98 U. S. 187, 194 (1879); W. Prosser, Law of
Torts $ 120, p. 854 (4th ed. 1971). The first element, "maliciousness," encompasses an inquiry into subjective intent
for bringing the suit. Stewart, supra, at 192-193; Prosser,
supra, $ 120, at 855. This quite often includes an inquiry
into the defendant's subjective belief as to whether he be504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT

lieved success was likely. See, e. g., 2 C. Addison, Law ofTorts || 854 (1876) ("Proof of the absence of belief in the truth

of the charge by the person making it . . . is almost alwaysinvolved in the proof of malice"). But the second element,
"probable cause," focuses principally on objective reasonable-ness.

Stewart, supra, at 194; Prosser, supra, $ 120, at 854.Thus, respondents can successfully defend this suit simply

by establishing that their reliance on the replevin statutewas objectively reasonable for someone with their knowledge
of the circumstances. But this is precisely the showing thatentitles a public official to immunity. Harlow v. Fitzgerald,
457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982) (official must show his action did not"violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights
of which a reasonable person would have known").2Nor do I see any reason that this "defense" may not be
asserted early in the proceedings on a motion for summaryjudgment, just as a claim to qualified immunity may be. Provided that the historical facts are not in dispute, the presence
or absence of "probable cause" has long been acknowledgedto be a question of law.

Stewart, supra, at 193-194; 2 Addison, supra, || 853, n. (p); J. Bishop, Commentaries on Non-Contract Law $ 240, p. 95 (1889). And so I see no reason

that the trial judge may not resolve a summary judgmentmotion premised on such a good-faith defense, just as we
have encouraged trial judges to do with respect to qualified

2 There is perhaps one small difference between the historic commonlaw inquiry and the modern qualified immunity inquiry. At common law,
a plaintiff can show the lack of probable cause either by showing that the
actual facts did not amount to probable cause (an objective inquiry) or by
showing that the defendant lacked a sincere belief that probable cause
existed (a subjective inquiry). Bishop, Commentaries on Non-Contract
Law $ 239, at 95. But relying on the subjective belief, rather than on an
objective lack of probable cause, is clearly exceptional. See Stewart v.
Sonneborn, 98 U. S. 187, 194 (1879) (describing subjective basis for finding
lack of probable cause as exception to general rule). I see no reason to
base our decision whether to extend a contemporary, objectively based
qualified immunity on the exceptional common-law case.

immunity claims. Harlow, supra, at 818. Thus, private de-fendants who have invoked a state attachment law are put

in the same position whether we recognize that they are enti-tled to qualified immunity or if we instead recognize a goodfaith defense. Perhaps the Court believes that the "defense" will be less amenable to summary disposition than willthe "immunity"; perhaps it believes the defense will be an

issue that must be submitted to the jury, see ante, at 168(referring to cases such as this "proceed[ing] to trial").
While I can see no reason why this would be so (given thatprobable cause is a legal question), if it is true, today's decision will only manage to increase litigation costs needlessly
for hapless defendants.

This, in turn, leads to the second basis on which we have
previously recognized a qualified immunity--reasons of public policy. Assuming that some practical difference will result from recognizing a defense but not an immunity, I think
such a step is neither dictated by our prior decisions nor
desirable. It is true, as the Court points out, that in abandoning a strictly historical approach to $ 1983 immunities we
have often explained our decision to recognize an immunity
in terms of the special needs of public officials. But those
cases simply do not answer--because the question was not
at issue--whether similar (or even completely unrelated) reasons of public policy would warrant immunity for private
parties as well.

I believe there are such reasons. The normal presumption that attaches to any law is that society will be benefited
if private parties rely on that law to provide them a remedy,
rather than turning to some form of private, and perhaps
lawless, relief. In denying immunity to those who reasonably rely on presumptively valid state law, and thereby discouraging such reliance, the Court expresses confidence that
today's decision will not "unduly impai[r]," ibid., the public
interest. I do not share that confidence. I would have
thought it beyond peradventure that there is strong public

interest in encouraging private citizens to rely on valid statelaws of which they have no reason to doubt the validity. Buller v. Buechler, 706 F. 2d 844, 851 (CA8 1983); Folsom Invest-ment Co. v. Moore, 681 F. 2d 1032, 1037-1038 (CA5 1982).

Second, as with the police officer making an arrest, I be-lieve the private plaintiff 's lot is "not so unhappy" that he
must forgo recovery of property he believes to be properlyrecoverable through available legal processes or to be
"mulcted in damages," Pierson, 386 U. S., at 555, if his beliefturns out to be mistaken. For as one Court of Appeals has
pointed out, it is at least passing strange to conclude thatprivate individuals are acting "under color of law" because
they invoke a state garnishment statute and the aid of stateofficers, see Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922
(1982), but yet deny them the immunity to which those samestate officers are entitled, simply because the private parties
are not state employees. Buller, supra, at 851. Whilesome of the strangeness may be laid at the doorstep of our
decision in Lugar, see 457 U. S., at 943 (Burger, C. J., dissent-ing); and

id., at 944-956 (Powell, J., dissenting), there is noreason to proceed still further down this path. Our $ 1983

jurisprudence has gone very far afield indeed, when it sub-jects private parties to greater risk than their public counterparts, despite the fact that $ 1983's historic purpose was"to prevent state officials from using the cloak of their authority under state law to violate rights protected againststate infringement."

Id., at 948 (emphasis added). See alsoMonroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 175-176 (1961).

Because I find today's decision dictated neither by our ownprecedent nor by any sound considerations of public policy,
I dissent.

WADE v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 91-5771. Argued March 23, 1992--Decided May 18, 1992
After his arrest on, inter alia, federal drug charges, petitioner Wade gave

law enforcement officials information that led them to arrest another
drug dealer. Subsequently, he pleaded guilty to the charges, and the
District Court sentenced him to the 10-year minimum sentence required
by 21 U. S. C. $ 841(b)(1)(B) and the United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (USSG). The court refused Wade's request
that his sentence be reduced below the minimum to reward him for
his substantial assistance to the Government, holding that 18 U. S. C.

$ 3553(e) and USSG $ 5K1.1 empower the district courts to make such a
reduction only if the Government files a motion requesting the departure. The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting Wade's arguments that
the District Court erred in holding that the absence of a Government
motion deprived it of the authority to reduce his sentence and that the
lower court was authorized to enquire into the Government's motives
for failing to file a motion.

Held:

1. Federal district courts have the authority to review the Government's refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion and to grant a remedy if they find that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive.
Since the parties assume that the statutory and Guidelines provisions
pose identical and equally burdensome obstacles, this Court is not required to decide whether $ 5K1.1 "implements" and thereby supersedes

$ 3553(e) or whether the provisions pose separate obstacles. In both
provisions, the condition limiting the court's authority gives the Government a power, not a duty, to file a substantial-assistance motion. Nonetheless, a prosecutor's discretion when exercising that power is subject
to constitutional limitations that district courts can enforce. Thus, a
defendant would be entitled to relief if the prosecution refused to file a
motion for a suspect reason such as the defendant's race or religion.
However, neither a claim that a defendant merely provided substantial
assistance nor additional but generalized allegations of improper motive
will entitle a defendant to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing. A defendant has a right to the latter procedures
only if he makes a substantial threshold showing of improper motive.

182 WADE v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
2. Wade has failed to raise a claim of improper motive. He has never
alleged or pointed to evidence tending to show that the Government
refused to file a motion for suspect reasons. And he argues to no avail
that, because the District Court erroneously believed that no impermissible motive charge could state a claim for relief, it thwarted his attempt
to show that the Government violated his constitutional rights by withholding the motion arbitrarily or in bad faith. While Wade would be
entitled to relief if the prosecutor's refusal to move was not rationally
related to any legitimate Government end, the record here shows no
support for his claim of frustration, and the claim as presented to the
District Court failed to rise to the level warranting judicial enquiry. In
response to the court's invitation to state what evidence he would introduce to support his claim, Wade merely explained the extent of his assistance to the Government. This is a necessary, but not a sufficient,
condition for relief, because the Government's decision not to move may
have been based simply on its rational assessment of the cost and benefit
that would flow from moving. Pp. 186-187.

936 F. 2d 169, affirmed.

Souter, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

J. Matthew Martin, by appointment of the Court, 502 U. S.1028, argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the

Section 3553(e) of Title 18 of the United States Code em-powers district courts, "[u]pon motion of the Government,"

to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum to reflecta defendant's "substantial assistance in the investigation or

Opinion of the Court
district courts to go below the minimum required under the
Guidelines if the Government files a "substantial assistance"
motion. This case presents the question whether district
courts may subject the Government's refusal to file such a
motion to review for constitutional violations. We hold that
they may, but that the petitioner has raised no claim to
such review.

On October 30, 1989, police searched the house of the
petitioner, Harold Ray Wade, Jr., discovered 978 grams of
cocaine, two handguns, and more than $22,000 in cash, and
arrested Wade. In the aftermath of the search, Wade gave
law enforcement officials information that led them to arrest
another drug dealer. In due course, a federal grand jury
indicted Wade for distributing cocaine and possessing cocaine with intent to distribute it, both in violation of 21
U. S. C. $ 841(a)(1); for conspiring to do these things, in violation of $ 846; and for using or carrying a firearm during,
and in relation to, a drug crime, in violation of 18 U. S. C.

$ 924(c)(1). Wade pleaded guilty to all four counts.

The presentence report put the sentencing range under
the Guidelines for the drug offenses at 97 to 121 months, but
added that Wade was subject to a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence, 21 U. S. C. $ 841(b)(1)(B), narrowing the
actual range to 120 to 121 months, see USSG $ 5G1.1(c)(2).
The report also stated that both USSG $ 2K2.4(a) and 18
U. S. C. $ 924(c) required a 5-year sentence on the gun count.
At the sentencing hearing in the District Court, Wade's lawyer urged the court to impose a sentence below the 10-year
minimum for the drug counts to reward Wade for his assistance to the Government. The court responded that the Government had filed no motion as contemplated in 18 U. S. C.

$ 3553(e) and USSG $ 5K1.1 for sentencing below the minimum, and ruled that, without such a motion, a court had no
power to go beneath the minimum. Wade got a sentence of
180 months in prison.

184 WADE v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
In the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Cir-cuit, Wade argued the District Court was in error to say that

the absence of a Government motion deprived it of authorityto impose a sentence below 10 years for the drug convictions.
Wade lost this argument, 936 F. 2d 169, 171 (1991), and failedas well on his back-up claim that the District Court was at
least authorized to enquire into the Government's motivesfor filing no motion, the court saying that any such enquiry
would intrude unduly upon a prosecutor's discretion, id., at172. We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 1003 (1991), and now
affirm.The full text of 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(e) is this:

"Limited Authority to Impose a Sentence Below a Stat-utory Minimum.--Upon motion of the Government, the
court shall have the authority to impose a sentencebelow a level established by statute as minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant's substantial assistancein the investigation or prosecution of another person
who has committed an offense. Such sentence shall beimposed in accordance with the guidelines and policy
statements issued by the Sentencing Commission pursu-ant to section 994 of title 28, United States Code."

And this is the relevant portion of USSG $ 5K1.1:

"Substant i al Assistance t o Author i ti es (PolicyStatement)

"Upon motion of the government stating that the de-fendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who hascommitted an offense, the court may depart from the
guidelines."
Because Wade violated federal criminal statutes that carrymandatory minimum sentences, this case implicates both 18

U. S. C. $ 3553(e) and USSG $ 5K1.1. Wade and the Govern-ment apparently assume that where, as here, the minimum

Opinion of the Court
under the Guidelines is the same as the statutory minimumand the Government has refused to file any motion at all,

the two provisions pose identical and equally burdensomeobstacles. See Brief for Petitioner 9, n. 2; Brief for United
States 11, n. 2. We are not, therefore, called upon to decide whether $ 5K1.1 "implements" and thereby supersedes$ 3553(e), see

United States v. Ah-Kai, 951 F. 2d 490, 493-494
(CA2 1991); United States v. Keene, 933 F. 2d 711, 713-714(CA9 1991), or whether the two provisions pose two separate

obstacles, see United States v. Rodriguez-Morales, 958 F. 2d1441, 1443-1447 (CA8 1992).

Wade concedes, as a matter of statutory interpretation,
that $ 3553(e) imposes the condition of a Government motion
upon the district court's authority to depart, Brief for Petitioner 9-10, and he does not argue otherwise with respect
to $ 5K1.1. He does not claim that the Government-motion
requirement is itself unconstitutional, or that the condition
is superseded in this case by any agreement on the Government's behalf to file a substantial-assistance motion, cf. Santobello v. New York, 404 U. S. 257, 262-263 (1971); United
States v. Conner, 930 F. 2d 1073, 1075-1077 (CA4), cert. denied, 502 U. S. 958 (1991). Wade's position is consistent with
the view, which we think is clearly correct, that in both

$ 3553(e) and $ 5K1.1 the condition limiting the court's authority gives the Government a power, not a duty, to file a
motion when a defendant has substantially assisted.

Wade nonetheless argues, and again we agree, that a
prosecutor's discretion when exercising that power is subject
to constitutional limitations that district courts can enforce.
Because we see no reason why courts should treat a prosecutor's refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion differently
from a prosecutor's other decisions, see, e. g., Wayte v. United
States, 470 U. S. 598, 608-609 (1985), we hold that federal
district courts have authority to review a prosecutor's refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion and to grant a
remedy if they find that the refusal was based on an uncon504us1$72z 04-04-96 21:08:22 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
stitutional motive. Thus, a defendant would be entitled torelief if a prosecutor refused to file a substantial-assistance

motion, say, because of the defendant's race or religion.It follows that a claim that a defendant merely provided
substantial assistance will not entitle a defendant to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing. Norwould additional but generalized allegations of improper motive. See, e. g., United States v. Redondo-Lemos, 955 F. 2d1296, 1302-1303 (CA9 1992);

United States v. Jacob, 781 F. 2d
643, 646-647 (CA8 1986); United States v. Gallegos-Curiel,681 F. 2d 1164, 1169 (CA9 1982) (Kennedy, J.);

United States
v. Berrios, 501 F. 2d 1207, 1211 (CA2 1974). Indeed, Wade
concedes that a defendant has no right to discovery or an
evidentiary hearing unless he makes a "substantial threshold
showing." Brief for Petitioner 26.

Wade has failed to make one. He has never alleged, much
less claimed to have evidence tending to show, that the Government refused to file a motion for suspect reasons such as
his race or his religion. Instead, Wade argues now that the
District Court thwarted his attempt to make quite different
allegations on the record because it erroneously believed that
no charge of impermissible motive could state a claim for
relief. Hence, he now seeks an order of remand to allow him
to develop a claim that the Government violated his constitutional rights by withholding a substantial-assistance motion
"arbitrarily" or "in bad faith." See Brief for Petitioner 25.
This, Wade says, the Government did by refusing to move
because of "factors that are not rationally related to any legitimate state objective," see Reply Brief for Petitioner 4,
although he does not specifically identify any such factors.

As the Government concedes, see Brief for United States
26 (citing New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U. S. 297, 303 (1976)
(per curiam)), Wade would be entitled to relief if the prosecutor's refusal to move was not rationally related to any legitimate Government end, cf. Chapman v. United States, 500
U. S. 453, 464-465 (1991), but his argument is still of no avail.

Opinion of the Court
This is so because the record shows no support for his claimof frustration in trying to plead an adequate claim, and because his claim as presented to the District Court failed torise to the level warranting judicial enquiry. The District
Court expressly invited Wade's lawyer to state for the recordwhat evidence he would introduce to support his position
if the court were to conduct a hearing on the issue. App.10. In response, his counsel merely explained the extent
of Wade's assistance to the Government. Ibid. This, ofcourse, was not enough, for although a showing of assistance
is a necessary condition for relief, it is not a sufficient one.The Government's decision not to move may have been based
not on a failure to acknowledge or appreciate Wade's help,but simply on its rational assessment of the cost and benefit
that would flow from moving. Cf. United States v. Doe, 290U. S. App. D. C. 65, 70, 934 F. 2d 353, 358, cert. denied, 502
U. S. 896 (1991); United States v. La Guardia, 902 F. 2d 1010,1016 (CA1 1990).

It is clear, then, that, on the present record, Wade is en-titled to no relief, and that the judgment of the Court of
Appeals must be

COLEMAN v. THOMPSON, WARDEN, et al.

on application for stay of execution ofsentence of death

No. A-877 (91-8336). Decided May 20, 1992
In the 12th round of judicial review in a murder case which began 11

years ago, the District Court concluded that applicant Coleman had
failed to produce even a "colorable claim of innocence."

Held: The application for a stay of execution is denied. There is no basis

for this Court to conclude that Coleman has produced "substantial evidence" of innocence, especially where the District Court has reviewed
the claim and rejected it on the merits.

Application denied.

Per Curiam.
As the District Court below observed, this is now the 12thround of judicial review in a murder case which began 11

years ago. Yet despite having had 11 years to produceexculpatory evidence, Coleman has produced what, in the
words of the District Court, does not even amount to a"colorable showing of `actual innocence.' " Civ. Action No.
92-0352-R (WD Va., May 12, 1992), p. 19. We are hardlywell positioned to second-guess the District Court's factual
conclusion--we certainly have no basis for concluding thatColeman has produced "

substantial evidence that he may beinnocent." Post, at 189 (emphasis added). Indeed, a good

deal of Coleman's effort in this latest round is devoted to anattempt to undermine an expert's genetic analysis that further implicated him in the crime--an analysis conductedafter trial at

Coleman's request under the supervision of theCommonwealth's courts.

Contrary to the dissent's characterization, Coleman's claimis far from "substantially identical" to that of Leonel Herrera, see Herrera v. Collins, No. 91-7328, cert. granted, 502U. S. 1085 (1992). In

Herrera the District Court concludedthat the evidence of innocence warranted further inquiry.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
See 954 F. 2d 1029 (CA5 1992). Here, in contrast, the District Court reviewed Coleman's claim of innocence and rejected it on the merits.

The application for stay of execution presented to The
Chief Justice and by him referred to the full Court is
denied.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens concurs in the denial of a stay and
would deny the petition for writ of certiorari.

Justice Blackmun, dissenting.
Last Term the Court ruled that Roger Coleman could not
present his arguments on the merits to the federal courts,
simply because the person then acting as his attorney had
made a trivial error in filing his notice of appeal three days
late. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991). While I
dissented from that ruling--and still believe it was erroneous--I found some consolation in the Court's suggestion that
matters might have been different had Coleman argued that
he was actually innocent of the crime. See id., at 747-751,
757.

Coleman has now produced substantial evidence that he
may be innocent of the crime for which he was sentenced to
die. Yet the Court once again turns him away, this time
permitting the Commonwealth of Virginia to execute him
without a hearing at which his evidence could be fully presented. The Court's ruling is all the more troubling for me,
in view of this Court's decision to hear argument next Term
in a case in which the petitioner contends, just as Coleman
does, that evidence of his innocence entitles him to a hearing on the merits. Herrera v. Collins, No. 91-7328, cert.
granted, 502 U. S. 1085 (1992).

I have previously voted to stay an execution pending this
Court's decision next Term in Herrera. See Ellis v. Texas,
503 U. S. 915 (1992); Ellis v. Collins, 503 U. S. 915 (1992). I

cannot believe that Coleman, who raises a substantially iden-tical claim, should be denied all possibility of relief simply

because his petition reached this Court later than did LeonelHerrera's. Accordingly, I would stay the execution.

Justice Souter would grant the application for stay ofexecution.

No. 90-1056. Argued October 8, 1991--Decided May 26, 1992
Respondent Freeman, while the treasurer for a political campaign in Tennessee, filed an action in the Chancery Court, alleging, among other
things, that $ 2-7-111(b) of the Tennessee Code--which prohibits the
solicitation of votes and the display or distribution of campaign materials within 100 feet of the entrance to a polling place--limited her ability
to communicate with voters in violation of, inter alia, the First and
Fourteenth Amendments. The court dismissed her suit, but the State
Supreme Court reversed, ruling that the State had a compelling interest
in banning such activities within the polling place itself but not on the
premises around the polling place. Thus, it concluded, the 100-foot limit
was not narrowly tailored to protect, and was not the least restrictive
means to serve, the State's interests.

Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
802 S. W. 2d 210, reversed and remanded.

Justice Blackmun, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice White,
and Justice Kennedy, concluded that $ 2-7-111(b) does not violate the
First and Fourteenth Amendments. Pp. 196-211.

(a) The section is a facially content-based restriction on political
speech in a public forum and, thus, must be subjected to exacting scrutiny: The State must show that the regulation is necessary to serve a
compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that
end. This case presents a particularly difficult reconciliation, since it
involves a conflict between the exercise of the right to engage in political
discourse and the fundamental right to vote, which is at the heart of
this country's democracy. Pp. 196-198.

(b) Section 2-7-111(b) advances Tennessee's compelling interests in
preventing voter intimidation and election fraud. There is a substantial
and long-lived consensus among the 50 States that some restricted zone
around polling places is necessary to serve the interest in protecting the
right to vote freely and effectively. The real question then is how large
a restricted zone is permissible or sufficiently tailored. A State is not
required to prove empirically that an election regulation is perfectly
tailored to secure such a compelling interest. Rather, legislatures
should be permitted to respond to potential deficiencies in the electoral
process with foresight, provided that the response is reasonable and

does not significantly impinge on constitutionally protected rights.
Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U. S. 189, 195-196. Section 2-7-
111(b)'s minor geographical limitation does not constitute such a significant impingement. While it is possible that at some measurable distance from the polls governmental regulation of vote solicitation could
effectively become an impermissible burden on the First Amendment,
Tennessee, in establishing its 100-foot boundary, is on the constitutional
side of the line. Pp. 198-211.

Justice Scalia concluded that $ 2-7-111 is constitutional because it
is a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral regulation of a nonpublic forum. The
environs of a polling place, including adjacent streets and sidewalks,
have traditionally not been devoted to assembly and debate and therefore do not constitute a traditional public forum. Cf. Greer v. Spock,
424 U. S. 828. Thus, speech restrictions such as those in $ 2-7-111 need
not be subjected to "exacting scrutiny" analysis. Pp. 214-216.

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
Justice Blackmun announced the judgment of the Court
and delivered an opinion, in which The Chief Justice, Justice White, and Justice Kennedy join.

Twenty-six years ago, this Court, in a majority opinion
written by Justice Hugo L. Black, struck down a state law
that made it a crime for a newspaper editor to publish an
editorial on election day urging readers to vote in a particular way. Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S. 214 (1966). While the
Court did not hesitate to denounce the statute as an "obvious
and flagrant abridgment" of First Amendment rights, id., at
219, it was quick to point out that its holding "in no way
involve[d] the extent of a State's power to regulate conduct
in and around the polls in order to maintain peace, order and
decorum there," id., at 218.

Today, we confront the issue carefully left open in Mills.
The question presented is whether a provision of the Tennessee Code, which prohibits the solicitation of votes and the
display or distribution of campaign materials within 100 feet
of the entrance to a polling place, violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

I

The State of Tennessee has carved out an election-day
"campaign-free zone" through $ 2-7-111(b) of its election
code. That section reads in pertinent part:

"Within the appropriate boundary as established in
subsection (a) [100 feet from the entrances], and the
building in which the polling place is located, the display
of campaign posters, signs or other campaign materials,
distribution of campaign materials, and solicitation of
votes for or against any person or political party or posiNevada, Nicholas J. Spaeth of North Dakota, Mark Barnett of South Dakota, Paul Van Dam of Utah, Mary Sue Terry of Virginia, and Mario

Violation of $ 2-7-111(b) is a Class C misdemeanor punish-able by a term of imprisonment not greater than 30 days or
a fine not to exceed $50, or both. Tenn. Code Ann. $$ 2-19-119 and 40-35-111(e)(3) (1990).

II
Respondent Mary Rebecca Freeman has been a candidatefor office in Tennessee, has managed local campaigns, and has

worked actively in statewide elections. In 1987, she was thetreasurer for the campaign of a city-council candidate in Metropolitan Nashville-Davidson County.Asserting that $$ 2-7-111(b) and 2-19-119 limited her ability to communicate with voters, respondent brought a facialchallenge to these statutes in Davidson County Chancery
Court. She sought a declaratory judgment that the provi-sions were unconstitutional under both the United States
and the Tennessee Constitutions. She also sought a perma-nent injunction against their enforcement.

The Chancellor ruled that the statutes did not violate theUnited States or Tennessee Constitutions and dismissed respondent's suit. App. 50. He determined that $ 2-7-111(b)was a content-neutral and reasonable time, place, and manner restriction; that the 100-foot boundary served a compel-ling state interest in protecting voters from interference, ha1 Section 2-7-111(a) also provides for boundaries of 300 feet for counties
within specified population ranges. Petitioner's predecessor Attorney
General (an original defendant) opined that this distinction was unconstitutional under Art. XI, $ 8, of the Tennessee Constitution. Tenn. Op. Atty.
Gen. No. 87-185 (1987). While this issue was raised in the pleadings, the
District Court held that respondent did not have standing to challenge the
300-foot boundaries because she was not a resident of any of those counties. The Tennessee Supreme Court did not reach the issue. Accordingly, the constitutionality of the 100-foot boundary is the only restriction
before us.

rassment, and intimidation during the voting process; andthat there was an alternative channel for respondent to exercise her free speech rights outside the 100-foot boundary.App. to Pet. for Cert. 1a.

The Tennessee Supreme Court, by a 4-to-1 vote, reversed.
802 S. W. 2d 210 (1990). The court first held that $ 2-7-111(b) was content based "because it regulates a specific

subject matter, the solicitation of votes and the display ordistribution of campaign materials, and a certain category of
speakers, campaign workers." Id., at 213. The court thenheld that such a content-based statute could not be upheld
unless (i) the burden placed on free speech rights is justified
by a compelling state interest and (ii) the means chosen bear
a substantial relation to that interest and are the least intrusive to achieve the State's goals. While the Tennessee Supreme Court found that the State unquestionably had shown
a compelling interest in banning solicitation of voters and
distribution of campaign materials within the polling place
itself, it concluded that the State had not shown a compelling
interest in regulating the premises around the polling place.
Accordingly, the court held that the 100-foot limit was not
narrowly tailored to protect the demonstrated interest.
The court also held that the statute was not the least restrictive means to serve the State's interests. The court found
less restrictive the current Tennessee statutes prohibiting
interference with an election or the use of violence or intimidation to prevent voting. See Tenn. Code Ann. $$ 2-19-101
and 2-19-115 (Supp. 1991). Finally, the court noted that if
the State were able to show a compelling interest in preventing congestion and disruption at the entrances to polling
places, a shorter radius "might perhaps pass constitutional
muster." 802 S. W. 2d, at 214.

Because of the importance of the issue, we granted certiorari. 499 U. S. 958 (1991). We now reverse the Tennessee
Supreme Court's judgment that the statute violates the
First Amendment of the United States Constitution.

Opinion of Blackmun, J.

III
The First Amendment provides that "Congress shall makeno law . . . abridging the freedom of speech . . . ." This

Court in Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88, 95 (1940), said:"The freedom of speech . . . which [is] secured by the First
Amendment against abridgment by the United States, [is]among the fundamental personal rights and liberties which
are secured to all persons by the Fourteenth Amendmentagainst abridgment by a State."

The Tennessee statute implicates three central concerns inour First Amendment jurisprudence: regulation of political
speech, regulation of speech in a public forum, and regulationbased on the content of the speech. The speech restricted
by $ 2-7-111(b) obviously is political speech. "Whatever dif-ferences may exist about interpretations of the First Amendment, there is practically universal agreement that a majorpurpose of that Amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs." Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S.,at 218. "For speech concerning public affairs is more than
self-expression; it is the essence of self-government." Gar-rison v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 64, 74-75 (1964). Accordingly,
this Court has recognized that "the First Amendment `hasits fullest and most urgent application' to speech uttered during a campaign for political office." Eu v. San FranciscoCty. Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 223 (1989)
(quoting Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U. S. 265, 272(1971)).

The second important feature of $ 2-7-111(b) is that it barsspeech in quintessential public forums. These forums include those places "which by long tradition or by governmentfiat have been devoted to assembly and debate," such as
parks, streets, and sidewalks. Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry
Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 45 (1983).2 "Such use

the campaign-free zone included sidewalks and streets adjacent to the polling places. See App. 23-24, 42. See also 802 S. W. 2d 210, 213 (1990).

of the streets and public places has, from ancient times, beena part of the privileges, immunities, rights, and liberties of

citizens." Hague v. CIO, 307 U. S. 496, 515 (1939) (opinionof Roberts, J.). At the same time, however, expressive activity, even in a quintessential public forum, may interferewith other important activities for which the property is
used. Accordingly, this Court has held that the governmentmay regulate the time, place, and manner of the expressive
activity, so long as such restrictions are content neutral, arenarrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and leave open ample alternatives for communication.
United States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 177 (1983). See also
Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989).The Tennessee restriction under consideration, however,

is not a facially content-neutral time, place, or mannerrestriction. Whether individuals may exercise their free
speech rights near polling places depends entirely onwhether their speech is related to a political campaign. The
statute does not reach other categories of speech, suchas commercial solicitation, distribution, and display. This
Court has held that the First Amendment's hostility tocontent-based regulation extends not only to a restriction
on a particular viewpoint, but also to a prohibition of publicdiscussion of an entire topic. See,

e. g., Consolidated Edi-son Co. of N. Y. v. Public Service Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S.

530, 537 (1980). Accord, Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members
of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 116 (1991)(statute restricting speech about crime is content based).

3 Content-based restrictions also have been held to raise Fourteenth
Amendment equal protection concerns because, in the course of regulating
speech, such restrictions differentiate between types of speech. See Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92 (1972) (exemption of labor
picketing from ban on picketing near schools violates Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection). See also City Council of Los Angeles

As a facially content-based restriction on political speechin a public forum, $ 2-7-111(b) must be subjected to exacting

scrutiny: The State must show that the "regulation is neces-sary to serve a compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end." Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry

Grace, 461 U. S., at 177.Despite the ritualistic ease with which we state this nowfamiliar standard, its announcement does not allow us toavoid the truly difficult issues involving the First Amendment. Perhaps foremost among these serious issues arecases that force us to reconcile our commitment to free
speech with our commitment to other constitutional rightsembodied in government proceedings. See,

e. g., Sheppardv. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333, 361-363 (1966) (outlining restrictions on speech of trial participants that courts may imposeto protect an accused's right to a fair trial). This case presents us with a particularly difficult reconciliation: the ac-commodation of the right to engage in political discourse
with the right to vote--a right at the heart of our democracy.

tion). Under either a free speech or equal protection theory, a contentbased regulation of political speech in a public forum is valid only if it can
survive strict scrutiny. Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 461-462 (1980).

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
Second, Tennessee argues that its restriction protects theright to vote in an election conducted with integrity and

reliability.5The interests advanced by Tennessee obviously are compelling ones. This Court has recognized that the "right tovote freely for the candidate of one's choice is of the essence
of a democratic society." Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533,555 (1964). Indeed,

"[n]o right is more precious in a free country than thatof having a voice in the election of those who make the
laws under which, as good citizens, we must live. Otherrights, even the most basic, are illusory if the right to
vote is undermined." Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U. S. 1,17 (1964).

Accordingly, this Court has concluded that a State has a com-pelling interest in protecting voters from confusion and
undue influence. See Eu, 489 U. S., at 228-229.The Court also has recognized that a State "indisputably
has a compelling interest in preserving the integrity of itselection process." Id., at 231. The Court thus has "upheld
generally applicable and evenhanded restrictions that pro-tect the integrity and reliability of the electoral process itself." Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 788, n. 9 (1983)(collecting cases). In other words, it has recognized that a
State has a compelling interest in ensuring that an individu-al's right to vote is not undermined by fraud in the election
process.To survive strict scrutiny, however, a State must do more
than assert a compelling state interest--it must demonstratethat its law is necessary to serve the asserted interest.

200 BURSON v. FREEMAN

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
While we readily acknowledge that a law rarely survives
such scrutiny, an examination of the evolution of election
reform, both in this country and abroad, demonstrates the
necessity of restricted areas in or around polling places.

During the colonial period, many government officials
were elected by the viva voce method or by the showing of
hands, as was the custom in most parts of Europe. That
voting scheme was not a private affair, but an open, public
decision, witnessed by all and improperly influenced by
some. The opportunities that the viva voce system gave for
bribery and intimidation gradually led to its repeal. See
generally E. Evans, A History of the Australian Ballot System in the United States 1-6 (1917) (Evans); J. Harris, Election Administration in the United States 15-16 (1934) (Harris); J. Rusk, The Effect of the Australian Ballot Reform on
Split Ticket Voting: 1876-1908, pp. 8-11 (1968) (Rusk).

Within 20 years of the formation of the Union, most States
had incorporated the paper ballot into their electoral system.
Initially, this paper ballot was a vast improvement. Individual voters made their own handwritten ballots, marked them
in the privacy of their homes, and then brought them to the
polls for counting. But the effort of making out such a ballot
became increasingly more complex and cumbersome. See
generally S. Albright, The American Ballot 14-19 (1942)
(Albright); Evans 5; Rusk 9-14.

Wishing to gain influence, political parties began to
produce their own ballots for voters. These ballots were
often printed with flamboyant colors, distinctive designs, and
emblems so that they could be recognized at a distance.
State attempts to standardize the ballots were easily
thwarted--the vote buyer could simply place a ballot in the
hands of the bribed voter and watch until he placed it in the
polling box. Thus, the evils associated with the earlier viva
voce system reinfected the election process; the failure of

201Cite as: 504 U. S. 191 (1992)

the law to secure secrecy opened the door to bribery 6 and
intimidation.7 See generally Albright 19-20; Evans 7, 11;
Harris 17, 151-152; V. Key, Politics, Parties, and Pressure
Groups 649 (1952); J. Reynolds, Testing Democracy: Electoral
Behavior and Progressive Reform in New Jersey, 1880-1920,
p. 36 (1988); Rusk 14-23.

6 One writer described the conditions as follows:
"This sounds like exaggeration, but it is truth; and these are facts so
notorious that no one acquainted with the conduct of recent elections now
attempts a denial--that the raising of colossal sums for the purpose of
bribery has been rewarded by promotion to the highest offices in the
Government; that systematic organization for the purchase of votes, individually and in blocks, at the polls, has become a recognized factor in the
machinery of the parties; that the number of voters who demand money
compensation for their ballots has grown greater with each recurring election." J. Gordon, The Protection of Suffrage 13 (1891) (quoted in Evans
11).

Evans reports that the bribery of voters in Indiana in 1880 and 1888
was sufficient to determine the results of the election and that "[m]any
electors, aware that the corrupt element was large enough to be able to
turn the election, held aloof altogether." Ibid.

7 According to a report of a committee of the 46th Congress, men were

frequently marched or carried to the polls in their employers' carriages.
They were then furnished with ballots and compelled to hold their hands
up with their ballots in them so they could easily be watched until the
ballots were dropped into the box. S. Rep. No. 497, 46th Cong., 2d Sess.,
9-10 (1880).

Evans recounted that intimidation, particularly by employers, was "extensively practiced":

"Many labor men were afraid to vote and remained away from the polls.
Others who voted against their employers' wishes frequently lost their
jobs. If the employee lived in a factory town, he probably lived in a tenement owned by the company, and possibly his wife and children worked in
the mill. If he voted against the wishes of the mill-owners, he and his
family were thrown out of the mill, out of the tenement, and out of the
means of earning a livelihood. Frequently the owner and the manager of
the mill stood at the entrance of the polling-place and closely observed the
employees while they voted. In this condition, it cannot be said that the
workingmen exercised any real choice." Evans 12-13 (footnote omitted).

202 BURSON v. FREEMAN

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
Approaching the polling place under this system was akinto entering an open auction place. As the elector started

his journey to the polls, he was met by various party ticketpeddlers "who were only too anxious to supply him with
their party tickets." Evans 9. Often the competition became heated when several such peddlers found an uncom-mitted or wavering voter. See L. Fredman, The Australian Ballot: The Story of an American Reform 24 (1968)(Fredman); Rusk 17. Sham battles were frequently engaged in to keep away elderly and timid voters of the opposi-tion. See Fredman 24, 26-27; 143 North American Review
628-629 (1886) (cited in Evans 16). In short, these early
elections "were not a very pleasant spectacle for those who
believed in democratic government." Id., at 10.

The problems with voter intimidation and election fraud
that the United States was experiencing were not unique.
Several other countries were attempting to work out satisfactory solutions to these same problems. Some Australian
provinces adopted a series of reforms intended to secure the
secrecy of an elector's vote. The most famous feature of the
Australian system was its provision for an official ballot, encompassing all candidates of all parties on the same ticket.
But this was not the only measure adopted to preserve the
secrecy of the ballot. The Australian system also provided
for the erection of polling booths (containing several voting
compartments) open only to election officials, two "scrutinees" for each candidate, and electors about to vote. See J.
Wigmore, The Australian Ballot System as Embodied in the
Legislation of Various Countries 69, 71, 78, 79 (1889) (Wigmore) (excerpting provisions adopted by South Australia and
Queensland). See generally Albright 23; Evans 17; Rusk
23-24.

The Australian system was enacted in England in 1872
after a study by the committee of election practices identified
Australia's ballot as the best possible remedy for the existing situation. See Wigmore 14-16. Belgium followed Eng504us1$74L 04-04-96 21:25:19 PAGES OPINPGT

land's example in 1877. Like the Australian provinces, bothEngland and Belgium excluded the general public from the

entire polling room. See Wigmore 94, 105. See generallyAlbright 23-24; Evans 17-18; Rusk 24-25.

One of the earliest indications of the reform movement
in this country came in 1882 when the Philadelphia CivilService Reform Association urged its adoption in a pamphlet

entitled "English Elections." Many articles were writtenpraising its usefulness in preventing bribery, intimidation,
disorder, and inefficiency at the polls. Commentators ar-gued that it would diminish the growing evil of bribery by
removing the knowledge of whether it had been successful.
Another argument strongly urged in favor of the reform was
that it would protect the weak and dependent against intimidation and coercion by employers and creditors. The inability to determine the effectiveness of bribery and intimidation
accordingly would create order and decency at the polls.
See generally Albright 24-26; Evans 21-23; Rusk 25-29,
42-43.

After several failed attempts to adopt the Australian system in Michigan and Wisconsin, the Louisville, Kentucky,
municipal government, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
and the State of New York adopted the Australian system in
1888. The Louisville law prohibited all but voters, candidates or their agents, and electors from coming within 50
feet of the voting room inclosure. The Louisville law also
provided that candidates' agents within the restricted area
"were not allowed to persuade, influence, or intimidate any
one in the choice of his candidate, or to attempt doing
so . . . ." Wigmore 120. The Massachusetts and New York
laws differed somewhat from the previous Acts in that they
excluded the general public only from the area encompassed
within a guardrail constructed six feet from the voting compartments. See id., at 47, 128. This modification was considered an improvement because it provided additional monitoring by members of the general public and independent

candidates, who in most States were not allowed to be repre-sented by separate inspectors. Otherwise, "in order to perpetrate almost every election fraud it would only be neces-sary to buy up the election officers of the other party." Id.,
at 52. Finally, New York also prohibited any person from"electioneering on election day within any polling-place, or
within one hundred feet of any polling place." Id., at 131.See generally Evans 18-21; Rusk 26.

The success achieved through these reforms was imme-diately noticed and widely praised. See generally Evans
21-24; Rusk 26-31, 42-43. One commentator remarked ofthe New York law of 1888:

"We have secured secrecy; and intimidation by em-ployers, party bosses, police officers, saloonkeepers and
others has come to an end."In earlier times our polling places were frequently,
to quote the litany, `scenes of battle, murder, and suddendeath.' This also has come to an end, and until nightfall, when the jubilation begins, our election days arenow as peaceful as our Sabbaths.

"The new legislation has also rendered impossible theold methods of frank, hardy, straightforward and shameless bribery of voters at the polls." W. Ivins, The Elec-toral System of the State of New York, Proceedings of
the 29th Annual Meeting of the New York State BarAssociation 316 (1906).

The triumphs of 1888 set off a rapid and widespread adop-tion of the Australian system in the United States. By 1896,

8 Similar results were achieved with the Massachusetts law:
"Quiet, order, and cleanliness reign in and about the polling-places. I
have visited precincts where, under the old system, coats were torn off
the backs of voters, where ballots of one kind have been snatched from
voters' hands and others put in their places, with threats against using
any but the substituted ballots; and under the new system all was orderly
and peaceable." 2 Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social
Science 738 (1892).

almost 90 percent of the States had adopted the Australiansystem. This accounted for 92 percent of the national electorate. See Rusk 30-31. See also Albright 26-28; Evans27;

post, at 215, n. 1 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment)
(citations to statutes passed before 1900).

The roots of Tennessee's regulation can be traced back totwo provisions passed during this period of rapid reform.

Tennessee passed the first relevant provision in 1890 as partof its switch to an Australian system. In its effort to "secur[e] the purity of elections," Tennessee provided that onlyvoters and certain election officials were permitted within
the room where the election was held or within 50 feet of
the entrance. The Act did not provide any penalty for violation and applied only in the more highly populated counties
and cities. 1890 Tenn. Pub. Acts, ch. 24, $$ 12 and 13.

The second relevant provision was passed in 1901 as an
amendment to Tennessee's "Act to preserve the purity of
elections, and define and punish offenses against the elective
franchise." The original Act, passed in 1897, made it a misdemeanor to commit various election offenses, including the
use of bribery, violence, or intimidation in order to induce a
person to vote or refrain from voting for any particular person or measure. 1897 Tenn. Pub. Acts, ch. 14. The 1901
amendment made it a misdemeanor for any person, except
the officers holding the elections, to approach nearer than 30
feet to any voter or ballot box. This provision applied to all
Tennessee elections. 1901 Tenn. Pub. Acts, ch. 142.

These two laws remained relatively unchanged until 1967,
when Tennessee added yet another proscription to its secret
ballot law. This amendment prohibited the distribution of
campaign literature "on the same floor of a building, or
within one hundred (100) feet thereof, where an election is
in progress." 1967 Tenn. Pub. Acts, ch. 85.

In 1972, the State enacted a comprehensive code to regulate the conduct of elections. The code included a section
that proscribed the display and the distribution of campaign

material and the solicitation of votes within 100 feet of theentrance to a polling place. The 1972 "campaign-free zone"

is the direct precursor of the restriction challenged in thepresent litigation.

Today, all 50 States limit access to the areas in or aroundpolling places. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a-50a; Note,
Defoliating the Grassroots: Election Day Restrictions on Po-litical Speech, 77 Geo. L. J. 2137 (1989) (summarizing statutes
as of 1989). The National Labor Relations Board also limitsactivities at or near polling places in union-representation
elections.9In sum, an examination of the history of election regulation in this country reveals a persistent battle against twoevils: voter intimidation and election fraud. After an unsuccessful experiment with an unofficial ballot system, all 50States, together with numerous other Western democracies,
settled on the same solution: a secret ballot secured in partby a restricted zone around the voting compartments. We
find that this widespread and time-tested consensus demon-strates that some restricted zone is necessary in order to
serve the States' compelling interests in preventing voterintimidation and election fraud.

Respondent and the dissent advance three principal chal-lenges to this conclusion. First, respondent argues that restricted zones are overinclusive because States could securethese same compelling interests with statutes that make it a
misdemeanor to interfere with an election or to use violenceor intimidation to prevent voting. See,

e. g., Tenn. CodeAnn. $$ 2-19-101 and 2-19-115 (Supp. 1991). We are not

persuaded. Intimidation and interference laws fall short ofserving a State's compelling interests because they "deal

with only the most blatant and specific attempts" to impedeelections. Cf.

Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 28 (1976) (existence of bribery statute does not preclude need for limits oncontributions to political campaigns). Moreover, because

law enforcement officers generally are barred from the vicinity of the polls to avoid any appearance of coercion in theelectoral process, see Tenn. Code Ann. $ 2-7-103 (1985),

many acts of interference would go undetected. These un-detected or less than blatant acts may nonetheless drive the
voter away before remedial action can be taken.Second, respondent and the dissent argue that Tennessee's
statute is underinclusive because it does not restrict other
types of speech, such as charitable and commercial solicitation or exit polling, within the 100-foot zone. We agree that
distinguishing among types of speech requires that the statute be subjected to strict scrutiny. We do not, however,
agree that the failure to regulate all speech renders the statute fatally underinclusive. In fact, as one early commentator pointed out, allowing members of the general public access to the polling place makes it more difficult for political
machines to buy off all the monitors. See Wigmore 52.
But regardless of the need for such additional monitoring,
there is, as summarized above, ample evidence that political
candidates have used campaign workers to commit voter intimidation or electoral fraud. In contrast, there is simply
no evidence that political candidates have used other forms
of solicitation or exit polling to commit such electoral abuses.
States adopt laws to address the problems that confront
them. The First Amendment does not require States to
regulate for problems that do not exist.

Finally, the dissent argues that we confuse history with
necessity. Yet the dissent concedes that a secret ballot was
necessary to cure electoral abuses. Contrary to the dissent's contention, the link between ballot secrecy and some
restricted zone surrounding the voting area is not merely
timing--it is common sense. The only way to preserve the

504us1$74L 04-04-96 21:25:19 PAGES OPINPGT
208 BURSON v. FREEMAN

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
secrecy of the ballot is to limit access to the area around
the voter.10 Accordingly, we hold that some restricted zone
around the voting area is necessary to secure the State's
compelling interest.

The real question then is how large a restricted zone is
permissible or sufficiently tailored. Respondent and the dissent argue that Tennessee's 100-foot boundary is not narrowly drawn to achieve the State's compelling interest in
protecting the right to vote. We disagree.

As a preliminary matter, the long, uninterrupted, and
prevalent use of these statutes makes it difficult for States
to come forward with the sort of proof the dissent wishes to
require. The majority of these laws were adopted originally
in the 1890's, long before States engaged in extensive legislative hearings on election regulations. The prevalence of
these laws, both here and abroad, then encouraged their reenactment without much comment. The fact that these laws
have been in effect for a long period of time also makes it
difficult for the States to put on witnesses who can testify as
to what would happen without them. Finally, it is difficult
to isolate the exact effect of these laws on voter intimidation
and election fraud. Voter intimidation and election fraud
are successful precisely because they are difficult to detect.

Furthermore, because a government has such a compelling
interest in securing the right to vote freely and effectively,
this Court never has held a State "to the burden of demonstrating empirically the objective effects on political stability
that [are] produced" by the voting regulation in question.

10 The logical connection between ballot secrecy and restricted zones
distinguishes this case from those cited by the dissent in which the Court
struck down longstanding election regulations. In those cases, there was
no rational connection between the asserted interest and the regulation.
See, e. g., Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663, 666 (1966)
("Voter qualifications have no relation to wealth nor to paying or not paying this or any other tax").

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U. S. 189, 195 (1986).11Elections vary from year to year, and place to place. It is

therefore difficult to make specific findings about the effectsof a voting regulation. Moreover, the remedy for a tainted
election is an imperfect one. Rerunning an election would
have a negative impact on voter turnout.12 Thus, requiringproof that a 100-foot boundary is perfectly tailored to deal

with voter intimidation and election fraud

"would necessitate that a State's political system sustainsome level of damage before the legislature could take

corrective action. Legislatures, we think, should be
permitted to respond to potential deficiencies in the electoral process with foresight rather than reactively, provided that the response is reasonable and does not significantly impinge on constitutionally protected rights."
Id., at 195-196 (emphasis added).

11 This modified "burden of proof" does not apply to all cases in which
there is a conflict between First Amendment rights and a State's election
process--instead, it applies only when the First Amendment right threatens to interfere with the act of voting itself, i. e., cases involving voter
confusion from overcrowded ballots, like Munro, or cases such as this one,
in which the challenged activity physically interferes with electors attempting to cast their ballots. Thus, for example, States must come forward with more specific findings to support regulations directed at intangible "influence," such as the ban on election-day editorials struck down
in Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S. 214 (1966).

12 The dissent argues that our unwillingness to require more specific

findings is in tension with Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333 (1966), another case in which there was conflict between two constitutional rights.
Trials do not, however, present the same evidentiary or remedial problems. Because the judge is concerned only with the trial before him, it is
much easier to make specific findings. And while the remedy of rerunning a trial is an onerous one, it does not suffer from the imperfections of
a rescheduled election. Nonetheless, even in the fair trial context, we
reaffirmed that, given the importance of the countervailing right, " `our
system of law has always endeavored to prevent even the probability of
unfairness.' " Id., at 352 (quoting In re Murchison, 349 U. S. 133, 136
(1955)) (emphasis added).

210 BURSON v. FREEMAN

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
We do not think that the minor geographic limitationprescribed by $ 2-7-111(b) constitutes such a significant

impingement. Thus, we simply do not view the questionwhether the 100-foot boundary line could be somewhat
tighter as a question of "constitutional dimension." Id., at197. Reducing the boundary to 25 feet, as suggested by the
Tennessee Supreme Court, 802 S. W. 2d, at 214, is a differ-ence only in degree, not a less restrictive alternative in kind.
Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 30. As was pointed out inthe dissenting opinion in the Tennessee Supreme Court, it
"takes approximately 15 seconds to walk 75 feet." 802S. W. 2d, at 215. The State of Tennessee has decided that
these last 15 seconds before its citizens enter the pollingplace should be their own, as free from interference as possible. We do not find that this is an unconstitutional choice.13At some measurable distance from the polls, of course,
governmental regulation of vote solicitation could effectivelybecome an impermissible burden akin to the statute struck
down in Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S. 214 (1966). See alsoMeyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414 (1988) (invalidating absolute
bar against the use of paid circulators). In reviewing chal-lenges to specific provisions of a State's election laws, however, this Court has not employed any " `litmus-paper test'

13 Respondent also raises two more specific challenges to the tailoring of
the Tennessee statute. First, she contends that there may be some polling places so situated that the 100-foot boundary falls in or on the other
side of a highway. Second, respondent argues that the inclusion of quintessential public forums in some campaign-free zones could result in the
prosecution of an individual for driving by in an automobile with a campaign bumper sticker. At oral argument, petitioner denied that the statute would reach this latter, inadvertent conduct, since this would not constitute "display" of campaign material. Tr. of Oral Arg. 33-35. In any
event, these arguments are "as applied" challenges that should be made by
an individual prosecuted for such conduct. If successful, these challenges
would call for a limiting construction rather than a facial invalidation. In
the absence of any factual record to support respondent's contention that
the statute has been applied to reach such circumstances, we do not entertain the challenges in this case.

that will separate valid from invalid restrictions." Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S., at 789 (quoting Storer v. Brown,
415 U. S. 724, 730 (1974)). Accordingly, it is sufficient to say
that in establishing a 100-foot boundary, Tennessee is on the
constitutional side of the line.

In conclusion, we reaffirm that it is the rare case in which
we have held that a law survives strict scrutiny. This, however, is such a rare case. Here, the State, as recognized administrator of elections, has asserted that the exercise of free
speech rights conflicts with another fundamental right, the
right to cast a ballot in an election free from the taint of
intimidation and fraud. A long history, a substantial consensus, and simple common sense show that some restricted
zone around polling places is necessary to protect that fundamental right. Given the conflict between these two rights,
we hold that requiring solicitors to stand 100 feet from the
entrances to polling places does not constitute an unconstitutional compromise.

The judgment of the Tennessee Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Thomas took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.

Justice Kennedy, concurring.
Earlier this Term, I questioned the validity of the Court's
recent First Amendment precedents suggesting that a State
may restrict speech based on its content in the pursuit of a
compelling interest. Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of
N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 124-125 (1991)
(opinion concurring in judgment). Under what I deem the
proper approach, neither a general content-based proscription of speech nor a content-based proscription of speech in
a public forum can be justified unless the speech falls within

Kennedy, J., concurring
one of a limited set of well-defined categories. See ibid. To-day's case warrants some elaboration on the meaning of the

term "content based" as used in our jurisprudence.In

Simon & Schuster, my concurrence pointed out the
seeming paradox that notwithstanding "our repeated statement that `above all else, the First Amendment means thatgovernment has no power to restrict expression because of

its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content,' " id.,at 126 (quoting

Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S.
92, 95 (1972)), we had fallen into the practice of suggestingthat content-based limits on speech can be upheld if confined

in a narrow way to serve a compelling state interest. I continue to believe that our adoption of the compelling-interest
test was accomplished by accident, 502 U. S., at 125, and
as a general matter produces a misunderstanding that has
the potential to encourage attempts to suppress legitimate
expression.

The test may have a legitimate role, however, in sorting
out what is and what is not a content-based restriction. See
id., at 128 ("[W]e cannot avoid the necessity of deciding . . .
whether the regulation is in fact content based or content
neutral"). As the Court has recognized in the context of
regulations of the time, place, or manner of speech, "[g]overnment regulation of expressive activity is content neutral
so long as it is `justified without reference to the content
of the regulated speech.' " Ward v. Rock Against Racism,
491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989) (quoting Clark v. Community for
Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 293 (1984)) (emphasis
added in Ward). In some cases, the fact that a regulation
is content based and invalid because outside any recognized
category permitting suppression will be apparent from its
face. In my view that was true of the New York statute we
considered in Simon & Schuster, and no further inquiry was
necessary. To read the statute was sufficient to strike it
down as an effort by government to restrict expression because of its content.

Discerning the justification for a restriction of expression,however, is not always so straightforward as it was, or

should have been, in Simon & Schuster. In some cases, acensorial justification will not be apparent from the face of a
regulation which draws distinctions based on content, and
the government will tender a plausible justification unrelatedto the suppression of speech or ideas. There the compellinginterest test may be one analytical device to detect, in anobjective way, whether the asserted justification is in fact an
accurate description of the purpose and effect of the law.This explanation of the compelling-interest analysis is not
explicit in our decisions; yet it does appear that in time,
place, and manner cases, the regulation's justification is a
central inquiry. See, e. g., Ward v. Rock Against Racism,
supra, at 791; Clark v. Community for Creative NonViolence, supra, at 293; Heffron v. International Society for
Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U. S. 640, 648-649, and
n. 12 (1981). And in those matters we do not apply as strict
a requirement of narrow tailoring as in other contexts, Ward
v. Rock Against Racism, supra, at 797, although this may
be because in cases like Ward, Clark, and Heffron, content
neutrality was evident on the face of the regulations once
the justification was identified and became itself the object
of examination.

The same use of the compelling-interest test is adopted
today, not to justify or condemn a category of suppression
but to determine the accuracy of the justification the State
gives for its law. The outcome of that analysis is that the
justification for the speech restriction is to protect another
constitutional right. As I noted in Simon & Schuster, there
is a narrow area in which the First Amendment permits freedom of expression to yield to the extent necessary for the
accommodation of another constitutional right. 502 U. S., at
124, 128. That principle can apply here without danger that
the general rule permitting no content restriction will be
engulfed by the analysis; for under the statute the State acts

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
to protect the integrity of the polling place where citizensexercise the right to vote. Voting is one of the most fundamental and cherished liberties in our democratic system ofgovernment. The State is not using this justification to
suppress legitimate expression. With these observations, I
concur in the opinion of Justice Blackmun and the judg-ment of the Court.

Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment.
If the category of "traditional public forum" is to be a toolof analysis rather than a conclusory label, it must remain

faithful to its name and derive its content from tradition.Because restrictions on speech around polling places on election day are as venerable a part of the American traditionas the secret ballot, Tenn. Code Ann. $ 2-7-111 (Supp. 1991)
does not restrict speech in a traditional public forum, and
the "exacting scrutiny" that the plurality purports to apply,
ante, at 198, is inappropriate. Instead, I believe that $ 2-7-
111, though content based, is constitutional because it is
a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral regulation of a nonpublic
forum. I therefore concur in the judgment of the Court.

As the plurality correctly notes, the 100-foot zone established by $ 2-7-111 sometimes encompasses streets and sidewalks adjacent to the polling places. Ante, at 196, n. 2.
The plurality's determination that $ 2-7-111 is subject to
strict scrutiny is premised on its view that these areas are
"quintessential public forums," having " `by long tradition
. . . been devoted to assembly and debate.' " Ante, at 196
(emphasis added). Insofar as areas adjacent to functioning
polling places are concerned, that is simply not so. Statutes
such as $ 2-7-111 have an impressively long history of general use. Ever since the widespread adoption of the secret
ballot in the late 19th century, viewpoint-neutral restrictions
on election-day speech within a specified distance of the polling place--or on physical presence there--have been commonplace, indeed prevalent. By 1900, at least 34 of the 45

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
stricted zones often encompassed streets and sidewalks.
Thus, the streets and sidewalks around polling places have
traditionally not been devoted to assembly and debate.

Nothing in the public forum doctrine or in this Court's
precedents warrants disregard of this longstanding tradition.
"Streets and sidewalks" are not public forums in all places,
see Greer v. Spock, 424 U. S. 828 (1976) (streets and sidewalks on military base are not a public forum), and the long
usage of our people demonstrates that the portions of streets
and sidewalks adjacent to polling places are not public forums at all times either. This unquestionable tradition
could be accommodated, I suppose, by holding laws such as

$ 2-7-111 to be covered by our doctrine of permissible "time,
place, and manner" restrictions upon public forum speech--
which doctrine is itself no more than a reflection of our traditions, see Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn.,
460 U. S. 37, 45 (1983). The problem with this approach,
however, is that it would require some expansion of (or a
unique exception to) the "time, place, and manner" doctrine,
which does not permit restrictions that are not content neutral ($ 2-7-111 prohibits only electioneering speech). Ibid.
It is doctrinally less confusing to acknowledge that the environs of a polling place, on election day, are simply not a "traditional public forum"--which means that they are subject
to speech restrictions that are reasonable and viewpoint neutral. Id., at 46.

For the reasons that the plurality believes $ 2-7-111 survives exacting scrutiny, ante, at 198-211, I believe it is at
least reasonable; and respondent does not contend that it is
viewpoint discriminatory. I therefore agree with the judgment of the Court that $ 2-7-111 is constitutional.

Stevens, J., dissenting
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice O'Connor and
Justice Souter join, dissenting.

The speech and conduct prohibited in the campaign-freezone created by Tenn. Code Ann. $ 2-7-111 (Supp. 1991) is

classic political expression. As this Court has long recog-nized, "[d]iscussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of thesystem of government established by our Constitution. The
First Amendment affords the broadest protection to such po-litical expression in order `to assure [the] unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and socialchanges desired by the people.' "

Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S.1, 14 (1976) (citation omitted). Therefore, I fully agree with

the plurality that Tennessee must show that its " `regulationis necessary to serve a compelling state interest and that it
is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.' " Ante, at 198 (cita-tions omitted). I do not agree, however, that Tennessee has
made anything approaching such a showing.

Tennessee's statutory "campaign-free zone" raises consti-tutional concerns of the first magnitude. The statute directly regulates political expression and thus implicates acore concern of the First Amendment. Moreover, it targets
only a specific subject matter (campaign speech) and a de-fined class of speakers (campaign workers) and thus regulates expression based on its content. In doing so, the Ten-nessee statute somewhat perversely disfavors speech that
normally is accorded greater protection than the kinds ofspeech that the statute does not regulate. For these reasons, Tennessee unquestionably bears the heavy burden ofdemonstrating that its silencing of political expression is
necessary and narrowly tailored to serve a compelling stateinterest.

Statutes creating campaign-free zones outside pollingplaces serve two quite different functions--they protect or504us1$74L 04-04-96 21:25:19 PAGES OPINPGT

derly access to the polls and they prevent last-minute cam-paigning. There can be no question that the former constitutes a compelling state interest and that, in light ofour decision in

Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S. 214 (1966), the
latter does not. Accordingly, a State must demonstrate that
the particular means it has fashioned to ensure orderly ac-cess to the polls do not unnecessarily hinder last-minute

campaigning.Campaign-free zones are noteworthy for their broad, antiseptic sweep. The Tennessee zone encompasses at least30,000 square feet around each polling place; in some States,
such as Kentucky and Wisconsin, the radius of the restricted
zone is 500 feet--silencing an area of over 750,000 square
feet. Even under the most sanguine scenario of participatory democracy, it is difficult to imagine voter turnout so
complete as to require the clearing of hundreds of thousands
of square feet simply to ensure that the path to the pollingplace door remains open and that the curtain that protects
the secrecy of the ballot box remains closed.

The fact that campaign-free zones cover such a large area
in some States unmistakably identifies censorship of electionday campaigning as an animating force behind these restrictions. That some States have no problem maintaining order
with zones of 50 feet or less strongly suggests that the more
expansive prohibitions are not necessary to maintain access
and order. Indeed, on its face, Tennessee's statute appears
informed by political concerns. Although the statute initially established a 100-foot zon
