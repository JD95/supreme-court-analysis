CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 1991

KEENEY, SUPERINTENDENT, OREGON STATEPENITENTIARY v. TAMAYO-REYES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 90-1859. Argued January 15, 1992--Decided May 4, 1992
In collateral state-court proceedings, respondent, a Cuban immigrant with

little education and almost no knowledge of English, alleged, inter alia,
that his plea of nolo contendere to first-degree manslaughter had not
been knowing and intelligent and therefore was invalid because his
court-appointed translator had not translated accurately and completely
for him the mens rea element of the crime in question. The state court
dismissed the petition after a hearing, the Oregon Court of Appeals
affirmed, the State Supreme Court denied review, and the Federal
District Court denied respondent habeas corpus relief. However, the
Court of Appeals held that he was entitled to a federal evidentiary hearing on the question whether the mens rea element of the crime was
properly explained to him, since the record disclosed that the material
facts concerning the translation were not adequately developed at the
state-court hearing, see Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 313, and since
postconviction counsel's negligent failure to develop those facts did not
constitute a deliberate bypass of the orderly procedure of the state
courts, see id., at 317; Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 438.

Held: A cause-and-prejudice standard, rather than Fay's deliberate bypass standard, is the correct standard for excusing a habeas petitioner's
failure to develop a material fact in state-court proceedings. Townsend's holding that the Fay standard is applicable in a case like this
must be overruled in light of more recent decisions involving, like Fay, a

Syllabus
state procedural default, in which this Court has rejected the deliberate
bypass standard in favor of a standard of cause and prejudice. See,
e. g., Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 87-88, and n. 12; Coleman v.
Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 751. It would be irrational to distinguish between failing to properly assert a federal claim in state court and failing
in state court to properly develop such a claim, and to apply to the latter
a remnant of a decision that is no longer upheld with regard to the
former. Moreover, the concerns of finality, comity, judicial economy,
and channeling the resolution of claims into the most appropriate forum
that motivated the rejection of the Fay standard in the state procedural
default cases are equally applicable to this case. Finally, applying the
cause-and-prejudice standard here also advances uniformity in habeas
corpus law. Thus, respondent is entitled to a federal evidentiary hearing if he can show cause for his failure to develop the facts in the statecourt proceedings and actual prejudice resulting from that failure, or if
he can show that a fundamental miscarriage of justice would result from
failure to hold such a hearing. See, e. g., McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S.

Opinion of the Court
Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court.
Respondent is a Cuban immigrant with little education and
almost no knowledge of English. In 1984, he was charged
with murder arising from the stabbing death of a man who
had allegedly attempted to intervene in a confrontation between respondent and his girlfriend in a bar.

Respondent was provided with a defense attorney and interpreter. The attorney recommended to respondent that
he plead nolo contendere to first-degree manslaughter. Ore.
Rev. Stat. $ 163.118(1)(a) (1987). Respondent signed a plea
form that explained in English the rights he was waiving by
entering the plea. The state court held a plea hearing, at
which petitioner was represented by counsel and his interpreter. The judge asked the attorney and interpreter if
they had explained to respondent the rights in the plea form
and the consequences of his plea; they responded in the affirmative. The judge then explained to respondent, in English, the rights he would waive by his plea, and asked the
interpreter to translate. Respondent indicated that he understood his rights and still wished to plead nolo contendere.
The judge accepted his plea.

Later, respondent brought a collateral attack on the plea
in a state-court proceeding. He alleged his plea had not
been knowing and intelligent and therefore was invalid because his translator had not translated accurately and completely for him the mens rea element of manslaughter. He
also contended that he did not understand the purposes of
the plea form or the plea hearing. He contended that he did
not know he was pleading no contest to manslaughter, but
rather that he thought he was agreeing to be tried for
manslaughter.

4 KEENEY v. TAMAYO-REYES

Opinion of the Court
After a hearing, the state court dismissed respondent's pe-tition, finding that respondent was properly served by his

trial interpreter and that the interpreter correctly, fully, andaccurately translated the communications between respondent and his attorney. App. 51. The State Court of Appealsaffirmed, and the State Supreme Court denied review.

Respondent then entered Federal District Court seekinga writ of habeas corpus. Respondent contended that the
material facts concerning the translation were not ade-quately developed at the state-court hearing, implicating the
fifth circumstance of Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 313(1963), and sought a federal evidentiary hearing on whether
his nolo contendere plea was unconstitutional. The DistrictCourt found that the failure to develop the critical facts relevant to his federal claim was attributable to inexcusable ne-glect and that no evidentiary hearing was required. App.
to Pet. for Cert. 37, 38. Respondent appealed.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recognized that
the alleged failure to translate the mens rea element of first-degree manslaughter, if proved, would be a basis for overturning respondent's plea, 926 F. 2d 1492, 1494 (1991), anddetermined that material facts had not been adequately developed in the state postconviction court, id., at 1500, appar-ently due to the negligence of postconviction counsel. The
court held that Townsend v. Sain, supra, at 317, and Fay v.
Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 438 (1963), required an evidentiary hear-ing in the District Court unless respondent had deliberately

bypassed the orderly procedure of the state courts. Be-cause counsel's negligent failure to develop the facts did not
constitute a deliberate bypass, the Court of Appeals ruledthat respondent was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on
the question whether the mens rea element of first-degreemanslaughter was properly explained to him. 926 F. 2d, at
1502.1

1 With respect to respondent's claim that the plea form and plea proceeding were not adequately translated, the Court of Appeals concluded that
state postconviction proceedings afforded petitioner ample opportunity to

Opinion of the Court
We granted certiorari to decide whether the deliberate by-pass standard is the correct standard for excusing a habeas

petitioner's failure to develop a material fact in state-courtproceedings. 502 U. S. 807 (1991). We reverse.

Because the holding of Townsend v. Sain that Fay v.
Noia's deliberate bypass standard is applicable in a case likethis had not been reversed, it is quite understandable that

the Court of Appeals applied that standard in this case. How-ever, in light of more recent decisions of this Court, Townsend's holding in this respect must be overruled.2 Fay v.
contest the translations, that the material facts surrounding these issues
were adequately developed, and that the state court's findings were adequately supported by the record. The Court of Appeals therefore held
that a federal evidentiary hearing on that claim was not required. 926
F. 2d, at 1502.

2 Justice O'Connor asserts that Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293

(1963), insofar as relevant to this case, merely reflected existing law.
The claim thus seems to be that the general rule stated by the Court
in Townsend governing when an evidentiary hearing must be granted to
a federal habeas corpus petitioner, as well as each of the Court's six
criteria particularizing its general pronouncement, reflected what was
to be found in prior holdings of the Court. This is a very doubtful
claim. Surely the Court at that time did not think this was the case,
for it pointedly observed that prior cases had not settled all aspects of the
hearing problem in habeas proceedings and that the lower federal courts
had reached widely divergent and irreconcilable results in dealing with
hearing issues. Id., at 310, and n. 8. Hence it deemed it advisable to
give further guidance to the lower courts. It also expressly stated that
the rules it was announcing "must be considered to supersede, to the
extent of any inconsistencies, the opinions in Brown v. Allen[, 344 U. S.
443 (1953)]." Id., at 312. This was necessary because Brown was inconsistent with the holding of Townsend regarding habeas petitioners
who failed to adequately develop federal claims in state-court proceedings. See Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 465 (1953) (federal court
may deny writ without rehearing of facts "where the legality of [the]
detention has been determined, on the facts presented," by the state
court) (emphasis added); id., at 463 (writ should be refused, without more,
if federal court satisfied from the record that "state process has given
fair consideration to the issues and the offered evidence") (emphasis
added). We have unequivocally acknowledged that Townsend substantially changed the availability of evidentiary hearings in federal

6 KEENEY v. TAMAYO-REYES

Opinion of the Court
Noia was itself a case where the habeas petitioner had nottaken advantage of state remedies by failing to appeal--a

procedural default case. Since that time, however, thisCourt has rejected the deliberate bypass standard in state
procedural default cases and has applied instead a standardof cause and prejudice.

In Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S. 536 (1976), we acknowl-edged a federal court's power to entertain an application for
habeas even where the claim has been procedurally waivedin state proceedings, but nonetheless examined the appropriateness of the exercise of that power and recognized, as wehad in

Fay, that considerations of comity and concerns forthe orderly administration of criminal justice may in some

circumstances require a federal court to forgo the exerciseof its habeas corpus power. 425 U. S., at 538-539. We held
that a federal habeas petitioner is required to show causefor his procedural default, as well as actual prejudice.

Id.,at 542.

In Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72 (1977), we rejectedthe application of

Fay's standard of "knowing waiver" or"deliberate bypass" to excuse a petitioner's failure to comply

with a state contemporaneous-objection rule, stating that thestate rule deserved more respect than the Fay standard accorded it. 433 U. S., at 88. We observed that proceduralrules that contribute to error-free state trial proceedings
are thoroughly desirable. We applied a cause-and-prejudicestandard to a petitioner's failure to object at trial and limited

habeas proceedings. See Smith v. Yeager, 393 U. S. 122, 125 (1968) (per
curiam).

It is not surprising, then, that none of the cases cited by Justice O'Connor remotely support Townsend's requirement for a hearing in any case
where the "material facts were not adequately developed at the statecourt hearing" due to petitioner's own neglect. 372 U. S., at 313. Finally, it is undeniable that Fay v. Noia's deliberate bypass standard overruled prior procedural default cases, and it is no less true that Townsend's
adoption of that standard as a definition of "inexcusable neglect" made
new law.

Opinion of the Court
Fay to its facts. 433 U. S., at 87-88, and n. 12. We haveconsistently reaffirmed that the "cause-and-prejudice" standard embodies the correct accommodation between the com-peting concerns implicated in a federal court's habeas power.
Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1, 11 (1984); Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S.
107, 129 (1982).In

McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991), we held that
the same standard used to excuse state procedural defaultsshould be applied in habeas corpus cases where abuse of the

writ is claimed by the government. Id., at 493. This con-clusion rested on the fact that the two doctrines are similar
in purpose and design and implicate similar concerns. Id.,
at 493-494. The writ strikes at finality of a state criminal
conviction, a matter of particular importance in a federal system. Id., at 491, citing Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 487

(1986). Federal habeas litigation also places a heavy burden
on scarce judicial resources, may give litigants incentives to
withhold claims for manipulative purposes, and may create
disincentives to present claims when evidence is fresh. 499
U. S., at 491-492. See also Reed v. Ross, supra, at 13; Wainwright, supra, at 89.

Again addressing the issue of state procedural default in
Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), we described
Fay as based on a conception of federal/state relations
that undervalued the importance of state procedural rules,
501 U. S., at 750, and went on to hold that the cause-andprejudice standard applicable to failure to raise a particular
claim should apply as well to failure to appeal at all. Ibid.
"All of the State's interests--in channeling the resolution of
claims to the most appropriate forum, in finality, and in having an opportunity to correct its own errors--are implicated
whether a prisoner defaults one claim or all of them." Id.,
at 750. We therefore applied the cause-and-prejudice standard uniformly to state procedural defaults, eliminating the
"irrational" distinction between Fay and subsequent cases.
501 U. S., at 751. In light of these decisions, it is similarly

8 KEENEY v. TAMAYO-REYES

Opinion of the Court
irrational to distinguish between failing to properly assert a
federal claim in state court and failing in state court to properly develop such a claim, and to apply to the latter a remnant of a decision that is no longer upheld with regard to
the former.

The concerns that motivated the rejection of the deliberate bypass standard in Wainwright, Coleman, and other
cases are equally applicable to this case.3 As in cases of
state procedural default, application of the cause-andprejudice standard to excuse a state prisoner's failure to develop material facts in state court will appropriately accommodate concerns of finality, comity, judicial economy, and
channeling the resolution of claims into the most appropriate forum.

Applying the cause-and-prejudice standard in cases like
this will obviously contribute to the finality of convictions,
for requiring a federal evidentiary hearing solely on the basis
of a habeas petitioner's negligent failure to develop facts in

3 Justice O'Connor puts aside our overruling of Fay v. Noia's standard
in procedural default cases on the ground that in those cases the causeand-prejudice standard is just an acceptable precondition to reaching the
merits of a habeas petitioner's claim, but insists that applying that standard to cases in which the petitioner defaulted on the development of a
claim is not subject to the same characterization. For the reasons stated
in the text, we disagree. Moreover, Justice O'Connor's position is considerably weakened by her concession that the cause-and-prejudice standard is properly applied to a factually undeveloped claim which had been
exhausted but which is first asserted federally in a second or later habeas petition.

Contrary to Justice O'Connor's view, post, at 17, we think it clear that
the Townsend Court thought that the same standard used to deny a hearing in a procedural default case should be used to deny a hearing in cases
described in its fifth circumstance. It is difficult to conceive any other
reason for our borrowing the deliberate bypass standard of Fay v. Noia,
particularly if, as the dissent seems to say, post, at 17, Townsend relied
on, but did not repeat, the analysis found in Fay v. Noia. Yet the dissent
insists that the rejection of Fay v. Noia's analysis in our later cases should
have no impact on a case such as we have before us now.

Opinion of the Court
state-court proceedings dramatically increases the opportunities to relitigate a conviction.

Similarly, encouraging the full factual development in
state court of a claim that state courts committed constitutional error advances comity by allowing a coordinate jurisdiction to correct its own errors in the first instance. It reduces the "inevitable friction" that results when a federal
habeas court "overturn[s] either the factual or legal conclusions reached by the state-court system." Sumner v. Mata,
449 U. S. 539, 550 (1981).

Also, by ensuring that full factual development takes
place in the earlier, state-court proceedings, the cause-andprejudice standard plainly serves the interest of judicial
economy. It is hardly a good use of scarce judicial resources
to duplicate factfinding in federal court merely because a
petitioner has negligently failed to take advantage of opportunities in state-court proceedings.

Furthermore, ensuring that full factual development of a
claim takes place in state court channels the resolution of the
claim to the most appropriate forum. The state court is the
appropriate forum for resolution of factual issues in the first
instance, and creating incentives for the deferral of factfinding to later federal-court proceedings can only degrade the
accuracy and efficiency of judicial proceedings. This is fully
consistent with, and gives meaning to, the requirement of
exhaustion. The Court has long held that state prisoners
must exhaust state remedies before obtaining federal habeas
relief. Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241 (1886). The requirement that state prisoners exhaust state remedies before a
writ of habeas corpus is granted by a federal court is now
incorporated in the federal habeas statute.4 28 U. S. C.

4 "An application for a writ of habeas corpus . . . shall not be granted
unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available
in the courts of the State . . . ." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b).

10 KEENEY v. TAMAYO-REYES

Opinion of the Court

$ 2254. Exhaustion means more than notice. In requiringexhaustion of a federal claim in state court, Congress surely

meant that exhaustion be serious and meaningful.The purpose of exhaustion is not to create a procedural
hurdle on the path to federal habeas court, but to channelclaims into an appropriate forum, where meritorious claims
may be vindicated and unfounded litigation obviated beforeresort to federal court. Comity concerns dictate that the
requirement of exhaustion is not satisfied by the mere state-ment of a federal claim in state court. Just as the State
must afford the petitioner a full and fair hearing on his fed-eral claim, so must the petitioner afford the State a full and
fair opportunity to address and resolve the claim on themerits. Cf. Picard v. Connor, 404 U. S. 270, 275 (1971).

Finally, it is worth noting that applying the cause-and-prejudice standard in this case also advances uniformity in
the law of habeas corpus. There is no good reason to main-tain in one area of habeas law a standard that has been rejected in the area in which it was principally enunciated.And little can be said for holding a habeas petitioner to one
standard for failing to bring a claim in state court and excus-ing the petitioner under another, lower standard for failing
to develop the factual basis of that claim in the same forum.A different rule could mean that a habeas petitioner would
not be excused for negligent failure to object to the introduc-tion of the prosecution's evidence, but nonetheless would be
excused for negligent failure to introduce any evidence of hisown to support a constitutional claim.

5 It is asserted by Justice O'Connor that in adopting 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254(d) Congress assumed the continuing validity of all aspects of Townsend, including the requirement of a hearing in all fifth circumstance cases
absent a deliberate bypass. For several reasons, we disagree. First, it
is evident that $ 2254(d) does not codify Townsend's specifications of when
a hearing is required. Townsend described categories of cases in which
evidentiary hearings would be required. Section 2254(d), however, does
not purport to govern the question of when hearings are required; rather,
it lists exceptions to the normal presumption of correctness of state-court

504us1$66D 04-04-96 19:48:31 PAGES OPINPGT

11Cite as: 504 U. S. 1 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
Respondent Tamayo-Reyes is entitled to an evidentiaryhearing if he can show cause for his failure to develop the

facts in state-court proceedings and actual prejudice result-ing from that failure. We also adopt the narrow exception

findings and deals with the burden of proof where hearings are held. The
two issues are distinct, and the statute indicates no assumption that the
presence or absence of any of the statutory exceptions will determine
whether a hearing is held.

Second, to the extent that it even considered the issue of default, Congress sensibly could have read Townsend as holding that the federal
habeas corpus standard for cases of default under Townsend's fifth circumstance and cases of procedural default should be the same. Third,

$ 2254(d) does not mention or recognize any exception for inexcusable neglect, let alone reflect the specific standard of deliberate bypass. In the
face of this silence, it should not be assumed that if there is to be a judicially created standard for equitable default, it must be no other than the
deliberate bypass standard borrowed by Townsend from a decision that
has since been repudiated.

We agree with Justice O'Connor that under our holding a claim invoking the fifth circumstance of Townsend will be unavailing where the cause
asserted is attorney error. Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478 (1986), and
Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), dictate as much. Such was
the intended effect of those cases, but this does not make that circumstance a dead letter, for cause may be shown for reasons other than attorney error. We noted in Murray, a procedural default case, that objective
factors external to the defense may impede counsel's efforts to comply and
went on to say: "Without attempting an exhaustive catalog of such objective impediments to compliance with a procedural rule, we note that a
showing that the factual or legal basis for a claim was not reasonably
available to counsel, see Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S., at 16, or that `some interference by officials,' Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 486 (1953), made compliance impracticable, would constitute cause under this standard." 477
U. S., at 488. Much of the same may be said of cases where the petitioner
has defaulted on the development of a claim.

Nor, to the extent it is relevant to our decision in this case, is Justice
O'Connor's argument that many forms of cause would fall under other
Townsend circumstances persuasive. For example, the third and sixth
circumstances of Townsend speak to the denial by a court of full and fair
hearing; however, a situation where facts were inadequately developed
because of interference from officials would fall naturally into the fifth
circumstance.

O'Connor, J., dissenting
to the cause-and-prejudice requirement: A habeas petition-er's failure to develop a claim in state-court proceedings will

be excused and a hearing mandated if he can show that afundamental miscarriage of justice would result from failure
to hold a federal evidentiary hearing. Cf. McCleskey v.
Zant, 499 U. S., at 494; Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S., at 496.The State concedes that a remand to the District Court is

appropriate in order to afford respondent the opportunity tobring forward evidence establishing cause and prejudice,
Brief for Petitioner 21, and we agree that respondent shouldhave that opportunity. Accordingly, the decision of the
Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded tothe District Court for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

So ordered.

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Blackmun,
Justice Stevens, and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.

Under the guise of overruling "a remnant of a decision,"
ante, at 8, and achieving "uniformity in the law," ante, at 10,the Court has changed the law of habeas corpus in a fundamental way by effectively overruling cases decided long be-fore Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293 (1963). I do not think
this change is supported by the line of our recent proceduraldefault cases upon which the Court relies: In my view, the

manslaughter without any understanding of what "man-slaughter" means. App. 58. If this assertion is true, his

conviction was unconstitutionally obtained, see Henderson v.
Morgan, 426 U. S. 637, 644-647 (1976), and Tamayo-Reyes
would be entitled to a writ of habeas corpus. Despite the
Court's attempt to characterize his allegation as a technicalquibble--"his translator had not translated accurately and

completely for him the mens rea element of manslaughter,"
ante, at 3--this much is not in dispute. Tamayo-Reyes has
alleged a fact that, if true, would entitle him to the reliefhe seeks.

Tamayo-Reyes initially, and properly, challenged the voluntariness of his plea in a petition for postconviction relief
in state court. The court held a hearing, after which it
found that "[p]etitioner's plea of guilty was knowingly and
voluntarily entered." App. 51. Yet the record of the postconviction hearing hardly inspires confidence in the accuracy
of this determination. Tamayo-Reyes was the only witness
to testify, but his attorney did not ask him whether his interpreter had translated "manslaughter" for him. Counsel instead introduced the deposition testimony of the interpreter,
who admitted that he had translated "manslaughter" only
as "less than murder." Id., at 27. No witnesses capable of
assessing the interpreter's performance were called; the attorney instead tried to direct the court's attention to various
sections of the interpreter's deposition and attempted to
point out where the interpreter had erred. When the prosecutor objected to this discussion on the ground that counsel
was not qualified as an expert witness, his "presentation of
the issue quickly disintegrated." 926 F. 2d 1492, 1499 (CA9
1991). The state court had no other relevant evidence before it when it determined that Tamayo-Reyes actually understood the charge to which he was pleading.

Contrary to the impression conveyed by this Court's opinion, the question whether a federal court should defer to this
sort of dubious "factfinding" in addressing a habeas corpus

petition is one with a long history behind it, a history thatdid not begin with Townsend v. Sain.

II

A

The availability and scope of habeas corpus have changedover the writ's long history, but one thing has remained constant: Habeas corpus is not an appellate proceeding, butrather an original civil action in a federal court. See,

e. g.,
Browder v. Director, Dept. of Corrections of Ill., 434 U. S.257, 269 (1978). It was settled over a hundred years ago

that "[t]he prosecution against [a criminal defendant] is acriminal prosecution, but the writ of habeas corpus . . . is not
a proceeding in that prosecution. On the contrary, it is anew suit brought by him to enforce a civil right." Ex parte
Tom Tong, 108 U. S. 556, 559-560 (1883). Any possibledoubt about this point has been removed by the statutory
procedure Congress has provided for the disposition of ha-beas corpus petitions, a procedure including such nonappellate functions as the allegation of facts, 28 U. S. C. $ 2242, thetaking of depositions and the propounding of interrogatories,

$ 2246, the introduction of documentary evidence, $ 2247, and,of course, the determination of facts at evidentiary hearings, $ 2254(d).To be sure, habeas corpus has its own peculiar set of
hurdles a petitioner must clear before his claim is properlypresented to the district court. The petitioner must, in general, exhaust available state remedies, $ 2254(b), avoid proce-dural default, Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991),
not abuse the writ, McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991),and not seek retroactive application of a new rule of law,
Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989). For much of our his-tory, the hurdles were even higher. See,

e. g., Ex parte Wat-kins, 3 Pet. 193, 203 (1830) (habeas corpus available only to

challenge jurisdiction of trial court). But once they havebeen surmounted--once the claim is properly before the dis504us1$66D 04-04-96 19:48:31 PAGES OPINPGT

O'Connor, J., dissenting
trict court--a habeas petitioner, like any civil litigant, hashad a right to a hearing where one is necessary to prove the

facts supporting his claim. See, e. g., Hawk v. Olson, 326U. S. 271, 278-279 (1945);

Holiday v. Johnston, 313 U. S. 342,
351-354 (1941); Walker v. Johnston, 312 U. S. 275, 285-287
(1941); Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U. S. 86, 92 (1923). Thuswhen we observed in

Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S., at 312,
that "the opportunity for redress . . . presupposes the oppor-tunity to be heard, to argue and present evidence," we were

saying nothing new. We were merely restating what hadlong been our understanding of the method by which contested factual issues raised on habeas should be resolved.

Habeas corpus has always differed from ordinary civil litigation, however, in one important respect: The doctrine of
res judicata has never been thought to apply. See, e. g.,
Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 458 (1953); Darr v. Burford,
339 U. S. 200, 214 (1950); Waley v. Johnston, 316 U. S. 101,
105 (1942); Salinger v. Loisel, 265 U. S. 224, 230 (1924). A
state prisoner is not precluded from raising a federal claim
on habeas that has already been rejected by the state courts.
This is not to say that state court factfinding is entitled to
no weight, or that every state prisoner has the opportunity
to relitigate facts found against him by the state courts.
Concerns of federalism and comity have pushed us from this
extreme just as the importance of the writ has repelled us
from the opposite extreme, represented by the strict application of res judicata. Instead, we have consistently occupied
the middle ground. Even before Townsend, federal courts
deferred to state court findings of fact where the federal
district judge was satisfied that the state court had fairly
considered the issues and the evidence and had reached a
satisfactory result. See, e. g., Brown, supra, at 458, 465;
Frank v. Mangum, 237 U. S. 309, 332-336 (1915). But
where such was not the case, the federal court entertaining
the habeas petition would examine the facts anew. See, e. g.,
Ex parte Hawk, 321 U. S. 114, 116, 118 (1944); Moore, supra,

504us1$66D 04-04-96 19:48:31 PAGES OPINPGT
16 KEENEY v. TAMAYO-REYES

O'Connor, J., dissenting
at 92. In Hawk, for example, we stated that a state prisonerwould be entitled to a hearing, 321 U. S., at 116, "where resort to state court remedies has failed to afford a full andfair adjudication of the federal contentions raised . . . because
in the particular case the remedy afforded by state law
proves in practice unavailable or seriously inadequate." Id.,at 118. In

Brown, we explained that a hearing may be dispensed with only "[w]here the record of the application af-fords an adequate opportunity to weigh the sufficiency of the

allegations and the evidence, and no unusual circumstancescalling for a hearing are presented." 344 U. S., at 463.

Townsend "did not launch the Court in any new direc-tions," Weisselberg, Evidentiary Hearings in Federal Habeas
Corpus Cases, 1990 B. Y. U. L. Rev. 131, 150, but it clarified
how the district court should measure the adequacy of thestate court proceeding.

Townsend specified six circumstances in which one could not be confident that "the state-court trier of fact has after a full hearing reliably found the

relevant facts." 372 U. S., at 313. The Court held that ahabeas petitioner is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his
factual allegations if

"(1) the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved
in the state hearing; (2) the state factual determinationis not fairly supported by the record as a whole; (3) the

fact-finding procedure employed by the state court wasnot adequate to afford a full and fair hearing; (4) there
is a substantial allegation of newly discovered evidence;
(5) the material facts were not adequately developed atthe state-court hearing; or (6) for any reason it appears

that the state trier of fact did not afford the habeas
applicant a full and fair fact hearing." Ibid.

That these principles marked no significant departure from
our prior understanding of the writ is evident from the view
expressed by the four dissenters, who had "no quarrel with
the Court's statement of the basic governing principle which

504us1$66D 04-04-96 19:48:31 PAGES OPINPGT

17Cite as: 504 U. S. 1 (1992)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
should determine whether a hearing is to be had in a federalhabeas corpus proceeding," but disagreed only with the

Court's attempt "to erect detailed hearing standards for themyriad situations presented by federal habeas corpus applications." Id., at 326-327 (Stewart, J., dissenting). Townsend thus did not alter the federal courts' practice of holdingan evidentiary hearing unless the state court had fairly considered the relevant evidence.The Court expressed concern in

Townsend that a petitioner might abuse the fifth circumstance described in theopinion, by deliberately withholding evidence from the state

factfinder in the hope of finding a more receptive forum in a
federal court. Id., at 317. To discourage this sort of disrespect for state proceedings, the Court held that such a petitioner would not be entitled to a hearing. Ibid. The Townsend opinion did not need to address this concern in much
detail, because a similar issue was discussed at greater
length in another case decided the same day, Fay v. Noia,
372 U. S. 391, 438-440 (1963). The Townsend opinion thus
merely referred the reader to the discussion in Fay, where
a similar exception was held to bar a state prisoner from
habeas relief where the prisoner had intentionally committed
a procedural default in state court. See Townsend, supra,
at 317.

Nearly 30 years later, the Court implies that Fay and
Townsend must stand or fall together. Ante, at 5-8. But
this is not so: The Townsend Court did not suggest that the
issues in Townsend and Fay were identical, or that they
were so similar that logic required an identical answer to
each. Townsend did not purport to rely on Fay as authority; it merely referred to Fay's discussion as a shorthand device to avoid repeating similar analysis. Indeed, reliance on
Fay as authority would have been unnecessary. Townsend
was essentially an elaboration of our prior cases regarding
the holding of hearings in federal habeas cases; Fay represented an overruling of our prior cases regarding procedural

18 KEENEY v. TAMAYO-REYES

O'Connor, J., dissenting
defaults. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S., at 744-747;
Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 82 (1977).

As the Court recognizes, ante, at 6, we have applied Townsend's analysis ever since. See, e. g., Vasquez v. Hillery, 474
U. S. 254, 258 (1986); Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U. S. 335, 341-
342 (1980); Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 318 (1979); LaVallee v. Delle Rose, 410 U. S. 690, 693-694 (1973); Boyd v.
Dutton, 405 U. S. 1, 3 (1972); Procunier v. Atchley, 400 U. S.446, 451 (1971). But we have not, in my view, been unjustifiably clinging to a poorly reasoned precedent. While weproperly abandoned

Fay because it was inconsistent with
prior cases that represented a better-reasoned balance of
state and federal interests, the same cannot be said of
Townsend.

The Court today holds that even when the reliability of
state factfinding is doubtful because crucial evidence was not
presented to the state trier of fact, a habeas petitioner is
ordinarily not entitled to an opportunity to prove the facts
necessary to his claim. This holding, of course, directly
overrules a portion of Townsend, but more than that, I think
it departs significantly from the pre-Townsend law of habeas
corpus. Even before Townsend, when a habeas petitioner's
claim was properly before a federal court, and when the accurate resolution of that claim depended on proof of facts
that had been resolved against the petitioner in an unreliable
state proceeding, the petitioner was entitled to his day in
federal court. As Justice Holmes wrote for the Court, in a
case where the state courts had rejected--under somewhat
suspicious circumstances--the petitioner's allegation that his
trial had been dominated by an angry mob: "[I]t does not
seem to us sufficient to allow a Judge of the United States
to escape the duty of examining the facts for himself when
if true as alleged they make the trial absolutely void."
Moore, 261 U. S., at 92. The class of petitioners eligible to
present claims on habeas may have been narrower in days
gone by, and the class of claims one might present may have

been smaller, but once the claim was properly before thecourt, the right to a hearing was not construed as narrowly

as the Court construes it today.

B
Instead of looking to the history of the right to an eviden-tiary hearing, the Court simply borrows the cause and prejudice standard from a series of our recent habeas corpuscases.

Ante, at 5-8. All but one of these cases address thequestion of when a habeas claim is properly before a federal

court despite the petitioner's procedural default. See Coleman v. Thompson, supra; Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478(1986); Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1 (1984); Engle v. Isaac, 456

U. S. 107 (1982); Wainwright v. Sykes, supra; Francis v. Hen-derson, 425 U. S. 536 (1976). The remaining case addresses
the issue of a petitioner's abuse of the writ. See McCleskeyv.

Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991). These cases all concern thequestion whether the federal court will consider the merits

of the claim, that is, whether the court has the authority toupset a judgment affirmed on direct appeal. So far as this
threshold inquiry is concerned, our respect for state proce-dural rules and the need to discourage abuse of the writ provide the justification for the cause and prejudice standard.As we have said in the former context: "[T]he Great Writ
imposes special costs on our federal system. The Statespossess primary authority for defining and enforcing the
criminal law. In criminal trials they also hold the initialresponsibility for vindicating constitutional rights. Federal
intrusions into state criminal trials frustrate both the States'sovereign power to punish offenders and their good-faith
attempts to honor constitutional rights." Engle, supra, at128.

The question we are considering here is quite different.Here, the Federal District Court has already determined
that it will consider the claimed constitutional violation; theonly question is how the court will go about it. When it

504us1$66D 04-04-96 19:48:31 PAGES OPINPGT
20 KEENEY v. TAMAYO-REYES

O'Connor, J., dissenting
comes to determining whether a hearing is to be held to re-solve a claim that is already properly before a federal court,

the federalism concerns underlying our procedural defaultcases are diminished somewhat. By this point, our concern
is less with encroaching on the territory of the state courtsthan it is with managing the territory of the federal courts
in a manner that will best implement their responsibility toconsider habeas petitions. Our adoption of a cause and prejudice standard to resolve the first concern should not causeus reflexively to adopt the same standard to resolve the second. Federalism, comity, and finality are all advanced bydeclining to permit relitigation of claims in federal court in
certain circumstances; these interests are less significantlyadvanced, once relitigation properly occurs, by permitting
district courts to resolve claims based on an incompleterecord.

III
The Court's decision today cannot be reconciled with sub-section (d) of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254, which Congress enacted only

three years after we decided Townsend. Subsection (d) pro-vides that state court factfinding "shall be presumed to be
correct, unless the applicant shall establish" one of eightlisted circumstances. Most of these circumstances are taken
word for word from Townsend, including the one at issuehere; $ 2254(d)(3) renders the presumption of correctness
inapplicable where "the material facts were not adequatelydeveloped at the State court hearing." The effect of the
presumption is to augment the habeas petitioner's burdenof proof. Where state factfinding is presumed correct, the
petitioner must establish the state court's error "by convinc-ing evidence"; where state factfinding is not presumed
correct, the petitioner must prove the facts necessary tosupport his claim by only a preponderance of the evidence.
Sumner v. Mata, 449 U. S. 539, 551 (1981).Section 2254(d) is not, in the strict sense, a codification of
our holding in Townsend. The listed circumstances in

504us1$66D 04-04-96 19:48:31 PAGES OPINPGT

21Cite as: 504 U. S. 1 (1992)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
Townsend are those in which a hearing must be held; thenearly identical listed circumstances in $ 2254(d) are those in

which facts found by a state court are not presumed correct.But the two are obviously intertwined. If a habeas petitioner fulfills one of the Townsend requirements he will be
entitled to a hearing, and by virtue of fulfilling a Townsendrequirement he will necessarily have also fulfilled one of the

$ 2254(d) requirements, so that at his hearing the presump-tion of correctness will not apply. On the other hand, if
the petitioner has not fulfilled one of the Townsend require-ments he will generally not have fulfilled the corresponding

$ 2254(d) requirement either, so he will be entitled neither
to a hearing nor to an exception from the presumption of
correctness. Townsend and $ 2254(d) work hand in hand:
Where a petitioner has a right to a hearing he must prove
facts by a preponderance of the evidence, but where he has
no right to a hearing he must prove facts by the higher
standard of convincing evidence. Without the opportunity
for a hearing, it is safe to assume that this higher standard
will be unattainable for most petitioners. See L. Yackle,
Postconviction Remedies 508-509 (1981).

In enacting a statute that so closely parallels Townsend,
Congress established a procedural framework that relies
upon Townsend's continuing validity. In general, therefore,
overruling Townsend would frustrate the evident intent of
Congress that the question of when a hearing is to be held
should be governed by the same standards as the question
of when a federal court should defer to state court factfinding. In particular, the Court's adoption of a "cause and prejudice" standard for determining whether the material facts
were adequately developed in state proceedings will frustrate Congress' intent with respect to that Townsend circumstance's statutory analog, $ 2254(d)(3).

For a case to fit within this Townsend circumstance but
none of Townsend's other circumstances, the case will very
likely be like this one, where the material facts were not

504us1$66D 04-04-96 19:48:31 PAGES OPINPGT
22 KEENEY v. TAMAYO-REYES

O'Connor, J., dissenting
developed because of attorney error. Any other reason thematerial facts might not have been developed, such as that

they were unknown at the time or that the State denied afull and fair opportunity to develop them, will almost certainly be covered by one of Townsend's other circumstances.
See Townsend, 372 U. S., at 313. We have already held thatattorney error short of constitutionally ineffective assistance

of counsel does not amount to "cause." See Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S., at 488. As a result, the practical effect of
the Court's ruling today will be that for a case to fall within
Townsend's fifth circumstance but no other--for a petitioner
to be entitled to a hearing on the ground that the material
facts were not adequately developed in state court but on no
other ground--the petitioner's attorney must have rendered
constitutionally ineffective assistance in presenting facts to
the state factfinder.

This effect is more than a little ironic. Where the state
factfinding occurs at the trial itself, counsel's ineffectiveness
will not just entitle the petitioner to a hearing--it will entitle
the petitioner to a new trial. Where, as in this case, the
state factfinding occurs at a postconviction proceeding, the
petitioner has no constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel, so counsel's poor performance can never
constitute "cause" under the cause and prejudice standard.
Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S., at 752. After today's decision, the only petitioners entitled to a hearing under Townsend's fifth circumstance are the very people who do not need
one, because they will have already obtained a new trial or
because they will already be entitled to a hearing under one
of the other circumstances. The Court has thus rendered
unusable the portion of Townsend requiring hearings where
the material facts were not adequately developed in state
court.

As noted above, the fact that $ 2254(d)(3) uses language
identical to the language we used in Townsend strongly suggests that Congress presumed the continued existence of this

23Cite as: 504 U. S. 1 (1992)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
portion of Townsend. Moreover, the Court's application of
a cause and prejudice standard creates a conundrum regarding how to interpret $ 2254(d)(3). If a cause and prejudice
standard applies to $ 2254(d)(3) as well as Townsend's fifth
circumstance, then the Court has rendered $ 2254(d)(3) superfluous for the same reason this part of Townsend has become superfluous. While we may deprive portions of our
own prior decisions of any effect, we generally may not, of
course, do the same with portions of statutes. On the other
hand, if a cause and prejudice standard does not apply to

$ 2254(d)(3), we will have uncoupled the statute from the case
it was intended to follow, and there will likely be instances
where a petitioner will be entitled to an exception from the
presumption of correctness but will not be entitled to a hearing. This result does not accord with the evident intent of
Congress that the first inquiry track the second. Reconciliation of these two questions is now left to the district courts,
who still possess the discretion, which has not been removed
by today's opinion, to hold hearings even where they are not
mandatory. See Townsend, supra, at 318.

For these reasons, I think $ 2254(d) presumes the continuing validity of our decision in Townsend, including the
portion of the decision that recognized a "deliberate bypass"
exception to a petitioner's right to a hearing where the material facts were not adequately developed in the state court.

Jose Tamayo-Reyes alleges that he pleaded nolo contendere to a crime he did not understand. He has exhausted
state remedies, has committed no procedural default, has
properly presented his claim to a Federal District Court in
his first petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and would be
entitled to a hearing under the standard set forth in Townsend. Given that his claim is properly before the District
Court, I would not cut off his right to prove his claim at a
hearing. I respectfully dissent.

Kennedy, J., dissenting
Justice Kennedy, dissenting.
By definition, the cases within the ambit of the Court'sholding are confined to those in which the factual record developed in the state-court proceedings is inadequate to re-solve the legal question. I should think those cases will be
few in number. Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 318 (1963),has been the law for almost 30 years and there is no clear
evidence that this particular classification of habeas proceed-ings has burdened the dockets of the federal courts. And in
my view, the concept of factual inadequacy comprehends onlythose petitions with respect to which there is a realistic possibility that an evidentiary hearing will make a difference inthe outcome. This serves to narrow the number of cases in
a further respect and to ensure that they are the ones, as
Justice O'Connor points out, in which we have valid con-cerns with constitutional error.

Our recent decisions in Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S.722 (1991), McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991), and
Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), serve to protect theintegrity of the writ, curbing its abuse and ensuring that the
legal questions presented are ones which, if resolved againstthe State, can invalidate a final judgment. So we consider
today only those habeas actions which present questions fed-eral courts are bound to decide in order to protect constitutional rights. We ought not to take steps which diminishthe likelihood that those courts will base their legal decision
on an accurate assessment of the facts. For these reasonsand all those set forth by

Justice O'Connor, I dissent fromthe opinion and judgment of the Court.

25OCTOBER TERM, 1991
Syllabus

DENTON, DIRECTOR OF CORRECTIONS OF CALI-FORNIA,

et al. v. HERNANDEZ

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 90-1846. Argued February 24, 1992--Decided May 4, 1992
Respondent Hernandez, a prisoner proceeding pro se, filed five civil rights

suits in forma pauperis against petitioner California prison officials,
alleging, inter alia, that he was drugged and homosexually raped 28
times by various inmates and prison officials at different institutions.
Finding that the facts alleged appeared to be wholly fanciful, the District Court dismissed the cases under 28 U. S. C. $ 1915(d), which allows
courts to dismiss an in forma pauperis complaint "if satisfied that the
action is frivolous." Reviewing the dismissals de novo, the Court of
Appeals reversed and remanded three of the cases. The court's lead
opinion concluded that a court can dismiss a complaint as factually frivolous only if the allegations conflict with judicially noticeable facts and
that it was impossible to take judicial notice that none of the alleged
rapes occurred; the concurring opinion concluded that Circuit precedent
required that Hernandez be given notice that his claims were to be dismissed as frivolous and a chance to amend his complaints. The Court
of Appeals adhered to these positions on remand from this Court for
consideration of the Court's intervening decision in Neitzke v. Williams,
490 U. S. 319, which held that an in forma pauperis complaint "is frivolous [under $ 1915(d)] where it lacks an arguable basis either in law or
in fact," id., at 325.

Held:

1. The Court of Appeals incorrectly limited the power granted the
courts to dismiss a frivolous case under $ 1915(d). Section 1915(d) gives
the courts "the unusual power to pierce the veil of the complaint's factual allegations and dismiss those claims whose factual contentions are
clearly baseless." Id., at 327. Thus, the court is not bound, as it usually is when making a determination based solely on the pleadings, to
accept without question the truth of the plaintiff's allegations. However, in order to respect the congressional goal of assuring equality of
consideration for all litigants, the initial assessment of the in forma
pauperis plaintiff's factual allegations must be weighted in the plaintiff's favor. A factual frivolousness finding is appropriate when the
facts alleged rise to the level of the irrational or the wholly incredible,

504us1$67z 04-04-96 19:55:19 PAGES OPINPGT
26 DENTON v. HERNANDEZ

Syllabus
whether or not there are judicially noticeable facts available to contradict them, but a complaint cannot be dismissed simply because the court
finds the allegations to be improbable or unlikely. The "clearly baseless" guidepost need not be defined with more precision, since the district courts are in the best position to determine which cases fall into
this category, and since the statute's instruction allowing dismissal if
a court is "satisfied" that the complaint is frivolous indicates that the
frivolousness decision is entrusted to the discretion of the court entertaining the complaint. Pp. 31-33.

2. Because the frivolousness determination is a discretionary one, a

$ 1915(d) dismissal is properly reviewed for an abuse of that discretion.
It would be appropriate for a court of appeals to consider, among other
things, whether the plaintiff was proceeding pro se, whether the district
court inappropriately resolved genuine issues of disputed fact, whether
the court applied erroneous legal conclusions, whether the court has
provided a statement explaining the dismissal that facilitates intelligent
appellate review, and whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice. With respect to the last factor, the reviewing court should determine whether the district court abused its discretion by dismissing the
complaint with prejudice or without leave to amend if it appears that
the allegations could be remedied through more specific pleading, since
dismissal under $ 1915(d) could have a res judicata effect on frivolousness determinations for future in forma pauperis petitions. This
Court expresses no opinion on the Court of Appeals' rule that a pro se

Richard W. Nichols, by appointment of the Court, 502
U. S. 966, argued the cause and filed a brief for respondent.*

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
The federal in forma pauperis statute, codified at 28
U. S. C. $ 1915, allows an indigent litigant to commence a civil
or criminal action in federal court without paying the administrative costs of proceeding with the lawsuit. The statute
protects against abuses of this privilege by allowing a district court to dismiss the case "if the allegation of poverty
is untrue, or if satisfied that the action is frivolous or malicious." $ 1915(d). In Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U. S. 319
(1989), we considered the standard to be applied when determining whether the legal basis of an in forma pauperis
complaint is frivolous under $ 1915(d). The issues in this
case are the appropriate inquiry for determining when an
in forma pauperis litigant's factual allegations justify a

$ 1915(d) dismissal for frivolousness, and the proper standard
of appellate review of such a dismissal.

officials at different institutions.* With few exceptions, thealleged perpetrators are not identified in the complaints, because Hernandez does not claim any direct recollection of theincidents. Rather, he asserts that he found needle marks on
different parts of his body, and fecal and semen stains on hisclothes, which led him to believe that he had been drugged
and raped while he slept.Hernandez's allegations that he was sexually assaulted on
the nights of January 13, 1984, and January 27, 1984, aresupported by an affidavit signed by fellow prisoner Armando
Esquer (Esquer Affidavit), which states:

"On January 13, 1984, at approximately 7:30 a.m., Iwas on my way to the shower, when I saw correctional

officer McIntyre, the P-2 Unit Officer, unlock inmateMike Hernandez's cell door and subsequently saw as two
black inmates stepped inside his cell. I did not see Officer McIntyre order these two black inmates out of in-mate Mike Hernandez's cell after they stepped inside,

even though inmate Mike Hernandez was asleep inside.After about ten minutes, I returned from the shower,
and I noticed my friend, Mike Hernandez, was being sex-ually assaulted by the two black inmates. Officer McIn*See Amended Complaint in Hernandez v. Ylst, et al., No. CIV S-83-

they and Officer McIntyre were up to no good. Afterthis last incident, I became convinced that Officer McIntyre was deliberately unlocking my friend, Mike Her-nandez's cell as he [lay] asleep, so that these two black

Hernandez also attempted to amend one complaint to includean affidavit signed by fellow inmate Harold Pierce, alleging
that on the night of July 29, 1983, he "witnessed inmate Du-shane B-71187 and inmate Milliard B-30802 assault and rape
inmate Mike Hernandez as he lay . . . asleep in bed 206 inthe N-2 Unit Dorm." See Exhibit G to Motion to Amend

The District Court determined that the five cases wererelated and referred them to a Magistrate, who recommended that the complaints be dismissed as frivolous. TheMagistrate reasoned that " `each complaint, taken separately,
is not necessarily frivolous,' " but that " `a different pictureemerges from a reading of all five complaints together.' "
Id., at 11. As he explained: " `[Hernandez] alleges that bothguards and inmates, at different institutions, subjected him
to sexual assaults. Despite the fact that different defend-ants are allegedly responsible for each assault, the purported
modus operandi is identical in every case. Moreover, theattacks occurred only sporadically throughout a three year
period. The facts thus appear to be "wholly fanciful" andjustify this court's dismissal of the actions as frivolous.' "

Opinion of the Court
Ibid. By order dated May 5, 1986, the District Courtadopted the recommendation of the Magistrate and dismissed the complaints.Hernandez appealed the dismissal of three of the five cases
(Nos. CIV S-83-0645, CIV S-83-1348, CIV S-85-0084; see
n. 1, supra). Reviewing the dismissal de novo, the Court ofAppeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded.

Hernandez v. Denton, 861 F. 2d 1421 (1988). In relevant part,Judge Schroeder's lead opinion concluded that a district

court could dismiss a complaint as factually frivolous only ifthe allegations conflicted with judicially noticeable facts, that
is, facts " `capable of accurate and ready determination by
resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.' " Id., at 1426 (quoting Fed. Rule Evid. 201). In
this case, Judge Schroeder wrote, the court could not dismiss
Hernandez's claims as frivolous because it was impossible to
take judicial notice that none of the alleged rapes occurred.
861 F. 2d, at 1426. Judge Wallace concurred on the ground
that Circuit precedent required that Hernandez be given notice that his claims were to be dismissed as frivolous and a
chance to amend his complaints to remedy the deficiencies.
Id., at 1427. Judge Aldisert dissented. He was of the opinion that the allegations were "the hallucinations of a troubled
man," id., at 1440, and that no further amendment could save
the complaint, id., at 1439-1440.

We granted petitioners' first petition for a writ of certiorari, 493 U. S. 801 (1989), vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for consideration
of our intervening decision in Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U. S.
319 (1989). On remand, the Court of Appeals reaffirmed its
earlier decision. 929 F. 2d 1374 (1991). Judge Schroeder
modified her original opinion to state that judicial notice was
just "one useful standard" for determining factual frivolousness under $ 1915(d), but adhered to her position that the
case could not be dismissed because no judicially noticeable
fact could contradict Hernandez's claims of rape. Id., at

Opinion of the Court
1376. Judge Wallace and Judge Aldisert repeated their ear-lier views.

We granted the second petition for a writ of certiorari toconsider when an in forma pauperis claim may be dismissed
as factually frivolous under $ 1915(d). 502 U. S. 937 (1991).We hold that the Court of Appeals incorrectly limited the
power granted the courts to dismiss a frivolous case under$ 1915(d), and therefore vacate and remand the case for application of the proper standard.

II
In enacting the federal in forma pauperis statute, Con-gress "intended to guarantee that no citizen shall be denied

an opportunity to commence, prosecute, or defend an action,civil or criminal, in any court of the United States, solely
because . . . poverty makes it impossible . . . to pay or securethe costs" of litigation.

Adkins v. E. I. DuPont de Nem-ours & Co., 335 U. S. 331, 342 (1948) (internal quotation

marks omitted). At the same time that it sought to lowerjudicial access barriers to the indigent, however, Congress
recognized that "a litigant whose filing fees and court costsare assumed by the public, unlike a paying litigant, lacks
an economic incentive to refrain from filing frivolous, mali-cious, or repetitive lawsuits."

Neitzke, supra, at 324. Inresponse to this concern, Congress included subsection (d) as

part of the statute, which allows the courts to dismiss anin forma pauperis complaint "if satisfied that the action is
frivolous or malicious."Neitzke v. Williams, supra, provided us with our first occasion to construe the meaning of "frivolous" under $ 1915(d).In that case, we held that "a complaint, containing as it does
both factual allegations and legal conclusions, is frivolouswhere it lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact."
Id., at 325. In Neitzke, we were concerned with the properstandard for determining frivolousness of legal conclusions,
and we determined that a complaint filed in forma pauperis

504us1$67z 04-04-96 19:55:19 PAGES OPINPGT
32 DENTON v. HERNANDEZ

Opinion of the Court
which fails to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Pro-cedure 12(b)(6) may nonetheless have "an arguable basis in

law" precluding dismissal under $ 1915(d). 490 U. S., at 328-329. In so holding, we observed that the

in forma pauperis
statute, unlike Rule 12(b)(6), "accords judges not only the
authority to dismiss a claim based on an indisputably merit-less legal theory, but also the unusual power to pierce the

veil of the complaint's factual allegations and dismiss thoseclaims whose factual contentions are clearly baseless."

Id.,
at 327. "Examples of the latter class," we said, "are claimsdescribing fantastic or delusional scenarios, claims with

which federal district judges are all too familiar." Id., at
328.

Petitioners contend that the decision below is inconsistent with the "unusual" dismissal power we recognized in
Neitzke, and we agree. Contrary to the Ninth Circuit's
assumption, our statement in Neitzke that $ 1915(d) gives
courts the authority to "pierce the veil of the complaint's
factual allegations" means that a court is not bound, as it
usually is when making a determination based solely on the
pleadings, to accept without question the truth of the plaintiff 's allegations. We therefore reject the notion that a
court must accept as "having an arguable basis in fact," id.,
at 325, all allegations that cannot be rebutted by judicially
noticeable facts. At the same time, in order to respect the
congressional goal of "assur[ing] equality of consideration for
all litigants," Coppedge v. United States, 369 U. S. 438, 447
(1962), this initial assessment of the in forma pauperis plaintiff 's factual allegations must be weighted in favor of the
plaintiff. In other words, the $ 1915(d) frivolousness determination, frequently made sua sponte before the defendant
has even been asked to file an answer, cannot serve as a
factfinding process for the resolution of disputed facts.

As we stated in Neitzke, a court may dismiss a claim as
factually frivolous only if the facts alleged are "clearly baseless," 490 U. S., at 327, a category encompassing allegations

Opinion of the Court
that are "fanciful," id., at 325, "fantastic," id., at 328, and"delusional,"

ibid. As those words suggest, a finding of factual frivolousness is appropriate when the facts alleged riseto the level of the irrational or the wholly incredible, whether

or not there are judicially noticeable facts available to contradict them. An in forma pauperis complaint may notbe dismissed, however, simply because the court finds the

plaintiff 's allegations unlikely. Some improbable allegationsmight properly be disposed of on summary judgment, but to
dismiss them as frivolous without any factual development isto disregard the age-old insight that many allegations might
be "strange, but true; for truth is always strange, Stranger
than fiction." Lord Byron, Don Juan, canto XIV, stanza 101
(T. Steffan, E. Steffan, & W. Pratt eds. 1977).

Although Hernandez urges that we define the "clearly
baseless" guidepost with more precision, we are confident
that the district courts, who are "all too familiar" with factually frivolous claims, Neitzke, supra, at 328, are in the best
position to determine which cases fall into this category. Indeed, the statute's instruction that an action may be dismissed if the court is "satisfied" that it is frivolous indicates
that frivolousness is a decision entrusted to the discretion of
the court entertaining the in forma pauperis petition. We
therefore decline the invitation to reduce the "clearly baseless" inquiry to a monolithic standard.

Because the frivolousness determination is a discretionary
one, we further hold that a $ 1915(d) dismissal is properly
reviewed for an abuse of that discretion, and that it was
error for the Court of Appeals to review the dismissal of
Hernandez's claims de novo. Cf. Boag v. MacDougall, 454
U. S. 364, 365, n. (1982) (per curiam) (reversing dismissal of
an in forma pauperis petition when dismissal was based on
an erroneous legal conclusion and not exercise of the "broad
discretion" granted by $ 1915(d)); Coppedge, supra, at 446
(district court's certification that in forma pauperis appellant is taking appeal in good faith, as required by $ 1915(a),

504us1$67z 04-04-96 19:55:19 PAGES OPINPGT
34 DENTON v. HERNANDEZ

Opinion of the Court
is "entitled to weight"). In reviewing a $ 1915(d) dismissalfor abuse of discretion, it would be appropriate for the Court

of Appeals to consider, among other things, whether theplaintiff was proceeding

pro se, see Haines v. Kerner, 404
U. S. 519, 520-521 (1972); whether the court inappropriately
resolved genuine issues of disputed fact, see supra, at 32-33;whether the court applied erroneous legal conclusions, see

Boag, 454 U. S., at 365, n.; whether the court has provided astatement explaining the dismissal that facilitates "intelligent appellate review," ibid.; and whether the dismissal waswith or without prejudice.

With respect to this last factor: Because a $ 1915(d) dismissal is not a dismissal on the merits, but rather an exercise
of the court's discretion under the in forma pauperis statute,
the dismissal does not prejudice the filing of a paid complaint
making the same allegations. It could, however, have a res
judicata effect on frivolousness determinations for future in
forma pauperis petitions. See, e. g., Bryant v. Civiletti, 214
U. S. App. D. C. 109, 110-111, 663 F. 2d 286, 287-288, n. 1
(1981) ($ 1915(d) dismissal for frivolousness is res judicata);
Warren v. McCall, 709 F. 2d 1183, 1186, and n. 7 (CA7 1983)
(same); cf. Rogers v. Bruntrager, 841 F. 2d 853, 855 (CA8
1988) (noting that application of res judicata principles
after $ 1915(d) dismissal can be "somewhat problematical").
Therefore, if it appears that frivolous factual allegations
could be remedied through more specific pleading, a court
of appeals reviewing a $ 1915(d) disposition should consider
whether the district court abused its discretion by dismissing
the complaint with prejudice or without leave to amend.
Because it is not properly before us, we express no opinion
on the Ninth Circuit rule, applied below, that a pro se litigant
bringing suit in forma pauperis is entitled to notice and an
opportunity to amend the complaint to overcome any deficiency unless it is clear that no amendment can cure the defect. E. g., Potter v. McCall, 433 F. 2d 1087, 1088 (1970);
Noll v. Carlson, 809 F. 2d 1446 (1987).

Accordingly, we vacate the judgment below and remandthe case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

My disagreement with the Court is narrow. I agree withits articulation of the standard to be applied in determining
whether an in forma pauperis complaint is frivolous under28 U. S. C. $ 1915(d). Moreover, precedent supports the
Court's decision to remand the case without expressing anyview on the proper application of that standard to the facts
of the case. See, e. g., Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County
Jail, 502 U. S. 367 (1992). Nevertheless, because I am satis-fied that the decision of the Court of Appeals is entirely consistent with the standard announced today, I would affirmits judgment.

UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 90-1972. Argued January 22, 1992--Decided May 4, 1992
Respondent Williams was indicted by a federal grand jury for alleged

violations of 18 U. S. C. $ 1014. On his motion, the District Court ordered the indictment dismissed without prejudice because the Government had failed to fulfill its obligation under Circuit precedent to present "substantial exculpatory evidence" to the grand jury. Following
that precedent, the Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held:

1. The argument that the petition should be dismissed as improvidently granted because the question presented was not raised below
was considered and rejected when this Court granted certiorari and is
rejected again here. The Court will not review a question that was
neither pressed nor passed on below, see, e. g., Stevens v. Department
of Treasury, 500 U. S. 1, 8, but there is no doubt that the Court of
Appeals passed on the crucial issue of the prosecutor's duty to present
exculpatory evidence to the grand jury. It is appropriate to review an
important issue expressly decided by a federal court where, as here,
although the petitioner did not contest the issue in the case immediately
at hand, it did so as a party to the recent proceeding upon which the
lower courts relied for their resolution of the issue, and did not concede
in the current case the correctness of that precedent. Pp. 40-45.

2. A district court may not dismiss an otherwise valid indictment because the Government failed to disclose to the grand jury "substantial
exculpatory evidence" in its possession. Pp. 45-55.

(a) Imposition of the Court of Appeals' disclosure rule is not supported by the courts' inherent "supervisory power" to formulate procedural rules not specifically required by the Constitution or the Congress.
This Court's cases relying upon that power deal strictly with the courts'
control over their own procedures, whereas the grand jury is an institution separate from the courts, over whose functioning the courts do not
preside. Any power federal courts may have to fashion, on their own
initiative, rules of grand jury procedure is very limited and certainly
would not permit the reshaping of the grand jury institution that would
be the consequence of the proposed rule here. Pp. 45-50.

(b) The Court of Appeals' rule would neither preserve nor enhance
the traditional functioning of the grand jury that the "common law" of

Opinion of the Court
the Fifth Amendment demands. To the contrary, requiring the prosecutor to present exculpatory as well as inculpatory evidence would alter
the grand jury's historical role, transforming it from an accusatory body
that sits to assess whether there is adequate basis for bringing a criminal charge into an adjudicatory body that sits to determine guilt or
innocence. Because it has always been thought sufficient for the grand
jury to hear only the prosecutor's side, and, consequently that the suspect has no right to present, and the grand jury no obligation to consider, exculpatory evidence, it would be incompatible with the traditional system to impose upon the prosecutor a legal obligation to present
such evidence. Moreover, motions to quash indictments based upon the
sufficiency of the evidence relied upon by the grand jury have never
been allowed, and it would make little sense to abstain from reviewing
the evidentiary support for the grand jury's judgment while scrutinizing
the sufficiency of the prosecutor's presentation. Pp. 51-55.

(c) This Court need not pursue respondent's argument that the
Court of Appeals' rule would save valuable judicial time. If there is
any advantage to the proposal, Congress is free to prescribe it. P. 55.

38 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMS

Opinion of the Court
Government failed to disclose to the grand jury "substantial
exculpatory evidence" in its possession.

I
On May 4, 1988, respondent John H. Williams, Jr., a Tulsa,
Oklahoma, investor, was indicted by a federal grand jury on
seven counts of "knowingly mak[ing] [a] false statement or
report . . . for the purpose of influencing . . . the action [of a
federally insured financial institution]," in violation of 18
U. S. C. $ 1014 (1988 ed., Supp. II). According to the indictment, between September 1984 and November 1985 Williams
supplied four Oklahoma banks with "materially false" statements that variously overstated the value of his current
assets and interest income in order to influence the banks'
actions on his loan requests.

Williams' misrepresentation was allegedly effected
through two financial statements provided to the banks, a
"Market Value Balance Sheet" and a "Statement of Projected
Income and Expense." The former included as "current
assets" approximately $6 million in notes receivable from
three venture capital companies. Though it contained a disclaimer that these assets were carried at cost rather than at
market value, the Government asserted that listing them as
"current assets"--i. e., assets quickly reducible to cash--was
misleading, since Williams knew that none of the venture
capital companies could afford to satisfy the notes in the
short term. The second document--the Statement of Projected Income and Expense--allegedly misrepresented Williams' interest income, since it failed to reflect that the interest payments received on the notes of the venture capital
companies were funded entirely by Williams' own loans to
those companies. The Statement thus falsely implied, according to the Government, that Williams was deriving interest income from "an independent outside source." Brief

Opinion of the Court
Shortly after arraignment, the District Court granted Wil-liams' motion for disclosure of all exculpatory portions of the

grand jury transcripts. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S.83 (1963). Upon reviewing this material, Williams demanded that the District Court dismiss the indictment, alleging that the Government had failed to fulfill its obligationunder the Tenth Circuit's prior decision in

United States v.
Page, 808 F. 2d 723, 728 (1987), to present "substantial excul-patory evidence" to the grand jury (emphasis omitted). His

contention was that evidence which the Government hadchosen not to present to the grand jury--in particular, Williams' general ledgers and tax returns, and Williams' testimony in his contemporaneous Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding--disclosed that, for tax purposes and otherwise, he
had regularly accounted for the "notes receivable" (and the
interest on them) in a manner consistent with the Balance
Sheet and the Income Statement. This, he contended, belied an intent to mislead the banks, and thus directly negated
an essential element of the charged offense.

The District Court initially denied Williams' motion, but
upon reconsideration ordered the indictment dismissed without prejudice. It found, after a hearing, that the withheld
evidence was "relevant to an essential element of the crime
charged," created " `a reasonable doubt about [respondent's]
guilt,' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a-24a (quoting United States
v. Gray, 502 F. Supp. 150, 152 (DC 1980)), and thus "render[ed] the grand jury's decision to indict gravely suspect,"
App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a. Upon the Government's appeal,
the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's order, following its earlier decision in Page, supra. It first sustained
as not "clearly erroneous" the District Court's determination
that the Government had withheld "substantial exculpatory
evidence" from the grand jury. See 899 F. 2d 898, 900-903
(CA10 1990). It then found that the Government's behavior
" `substantially influence[d]' " the grand jury's decision to indict, or at the very least raised a " `grave doubt that the

decision to indict was free from such substantial influence.' "Id., at 903 (quoting Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States,

487 U. S. 250, 263 (1988)); see 899 F. 2d, at 903-904. Underthese circumstances, the Tenth Circuit concluded, it was not
an abuse of discretion for the District Court to require theGovernment to begin anew before the grand jury.

1 We

granted certiorari. 502 U. S. 905 (1991).

II
Before proceeding to the merits of this matter, it is neces-sary to discuss the propriety of reaching them. Certiorari

was sought and granted in this case on the following ques-tion: "Whether an indictment may be dismissed because the
government failed to present exculpatory evidence to thegrand jury." The first point discussed in respondent's brief
opposing the petition was captioned "The `Question Pre-sented' in the Petition Was Never Raised Below." Brief in
Opposition 3. In granting certiorari, we necessarily consid-ered and rejected that contention as a basis for denying
review.

Justice Stevens' dissent, however, revisits that issue,and proposes that--after briefing, argument, and full consideration of the issue by all the Justices of this Court--wenow decline to entertain this petition for the same reason we
originally rejected, and that we dismiss it as improvidentlygranted. That would be improvident indeed. Our grant of
certiorari was entirely in accord with our traditional prac-tice, though even if it were not it would be imprudent (since
there is no doubt that we have jurisdiction to entertain thecase) to reverse course at this late stage. See, e. g., Ferguson v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 352 U. S. 521, 560(1957) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part);

art, J., concurring, joined by White, J.). Cf. Oklahoma Cityv. Tuttle, 471 U. S. 808, 816 (1985).

Our traditional rule, as the dissent correctly notes, pre-cludes a grant of certiorari only when "the question presented was not pressed or passed upon below." Post, at 58(internal quotation marks omitted). That this rule operates
(as it is phrased) in the disjunctive, permitting review of anissue not pressed so long as it has been passed upon, is illustrated by some of our more recent dispositions. As recentlyas last Term, in fact (in an opinion joined by

Justice Stevens), we entertained review in circumstances far more sug-gestive of the petitioner's "sleeping on its rights" than those

we face today. We responded as follows to the argument ofthe Solicitor General that tracks today's dissent:

"The Solicitor General . . . submits that the petitionfor certiorari should be dismissed as having been improvidently granted. He rests this submission on theargument that petitioner did not properly present the
merits of the timeliness issue to the Court of Appeals,and that this Court should not address that question for
the first time. He made the same argument in his oppo-sition to the petition for certiorari. We rejected that
argument in granting certiorari and we reject it againnow because the Court of Appeals, like the District
Court before it, decided the substantive issue pre-sented."

Stevens v. Department of Treasury, 500 U. S.1, 8 (1991) (

Blackmun, J.) (citations omitted).

And in another case decided last Term, we said the following:

"Respondents argue that this issue was not raisedbelow. The appeals court, however, addressed the

availability of a right of action to minority shareholdersin respondents' circumstances and concluded that respondents were entitled to sue. It suffices for our pur-poses that the court below passed on the issue presented, particularly where the issue is, we believe, in a

omitted).
(Justice Stevens' separate concurrence and dissent in Virginia Bankshares also reached the merits. Id., at 1110-1112.)

2 As Justice O'Connor has written:

"The standard we previously have employed is that wewill not review a question not pressed or passed on by

the courts below. Here, the Court of Appeals expresslyruled on the question, in an appropriate exercise of its

2 The dissent purports to distinguish Stevens and Virginia Bankshares
on the ground that, "[a]lthough the parties may not have raised the questions presented in the petitions . . . before the Courts of Appeals in those
cases, the courts treated the questions as open questions that they needed
to resolve in order to decide the cases." Post, at 58, n. 4. The significance of this distinction completely eludes us. While there is much to be
said for a rule (to which the Court has never adhered) limiting review to
questions pressed by the litigants below, the rule implicitly proposed by
the dissent--under which issues not pressed, but nevertheless passed
upon, may be reviewed only if the court below thought the issue an "open"
one--makes no sense except as a device to distinguish Stevens and Virginia Bankshares. It does nothing to further "the adversary process"
that is the object of the dissent's concern, post, at 59, n. 5; if a question
is not disputed by the parties, "the adversary process" is compromised
whether the court thinks the question open or not. Indeed, if anything,
it is compromised more when the lower court believes it is confronting a
question of first impression, for it is in those circumstances that the need
for an adversary presentation is most acute.

The dissent observes that where a court disposes of a case on the basis
of a "new rule that had not been debated by the parties, our review may
be appropriate to give the losing party an opportunity it would not otherwise have to challenge the rule." Ibid. That is true enough, but the
suggestion that this principle has something to do with Stevens and Virginia Bankshares is wholly unfounded: In neither case could--or did--the
losing party claim to have been ambushed by the lower court's summary
treatment of the undisputed issues which we later subjected to plenary
review.

appellate jurisdiction; it is therefore entirely proper inlight of our precedents for the Court to reach the question on which it granted certiorari . . . ." Springfieldv. Kibbe, 480 U. S. 257, 266 (1987) (dissenting opinion)

(emphasis in original; citations omitted).3
There is no doubt in the present case that the Tenth Cir-cuit decided the crucial issue of the prosecutor's duty to present exculpatory evidence.4 Moreover, this is not, as the dis-sent paints it, a case in which, "[a]fter losing in the Court of
Appeals, the Government reversed its position," post, at 57.

3 The Court's per curiam dismissal of the writ in Kibbe was based principally upon two considerations: (1) that the crucial issue was not raised in
the District Court because of failure to object to a jury instruction, thus
invoking Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides
that "[n]o party may assign as error the giving . . . [of] an instruction
unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict,"
and (2) that the crucial issue had in addition not explicitly been raised
in the petition for certiorari. 480 U. S., at 259, 260. Of course, neither
circumstance exists here.

4 Relying upon, and to some extent repeating, the reasoning of its earlier

holding in United States v. Page, 808 F. 2d 723 (1981), the Court of Appeals
said the following:

"We have previously held that a prosecutor has the duty to present
substantial exculpatory evidence to the grand jury. Although we do not
require the prosecutor to `ferret out and present every bit of potentially
exculpatory evidence,' we do require that substantial exculpatory evidence
discovered during the course of an investigation be revealed to the grand
jury. Other courts have also recognized that such a duty exists. This
requirement promotes judicial economy because `if a fully informed grand
jury cannot find probable cause to indict, there is little chance the prosecution could have proved guilt beyond a reasonable doubt to a fully informed
petit jury.' " 899 F. 2d 898, 900 (1990) (citations omitted).

This excerpt from the opinion below should make abundantly clear that,
contrary to the dissent's mystifying assertion, see post, at 58, and n. 3, we
premise our grant of certiorari not upon the Tenth Circuit's having "passed
on" the issue in its prior Page decision, but rather upon its having done
so in this case. We discuss Page only to point out that, had the Government not disputed the creation of the binding Tenth Circuit precedent in
that case, a different exercise of discretion might be appropriate.

Opinion of the Court
The dissent describes the Government as having "expresslyacknowledged [in the Court of Appeals] the responsibilities

described in Page," post, at 56 (emphasis added). It did nosuch thing. Rather, the Government acknowledged "that
it has certain responsibilities under . . . Page." Brief forUnited States in Response to Appellee's Brief in Nos. 88-
2827, 88-2843 (CA10), p. 9 (emphasis added). It conceded,in other words, not that the responsibilities

Page had im-posed were proper, but merely that Page had imposed

them--over the protests of the Government, but in a judg-ment that was nonetheless binding precedent for the panel
below. The dissent would apparently impose, as an absolutecondition to our granting certiorari upon an issue decided by
a lower court, that a party demand overruling of a squarelyapplicable, recent circuit precedent, even though that precedent was established in a case to which the party itself wasprivy and over the party's vigorous objection, see

Page, 808F. 2d, at 727 ("The government counters that a prosecutor

has no duty to disclose exculpatory evidence [to a grandjury]"), and even though no "intervening developments in
the law," post, at 59, n. 5, had occurred. That seems to usunreasonable.

In short, having reconsidered the precise question we re-solved when this petition for review was granted, we again
answer it the same way. It is a permissible exercise of ourdiscretion to undertake review of an important issue expressly decided by a federal court 5 where, although the peti5 Where certiorari is sought to a state court, "due regard for the appropriate relationship of this Court to state courts," McGoldrick v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 309 U. S. 430, 434-435 (1940), may suggest
greater restraint in applying our "pressed or passed upon" rule. In that
context, the absence of challenge to a seemingly settled federal rule deprives the state court of an opportunity to rest its decision on an adequate
and independent state ground. See Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 222
(1983), cited by the dissent post, at 59; see also Bankers Life & Casualty
Co. v. Crenshaw, 486 U. S. 71, 79-80 (1988). But cf. Cohen v. Cowles

tioner did not contest the issue in the case immediately athand, it did so as a party to the recent proceeding upon which

the lower courts relied for their resolution of the issue, anddid not concede in the current case the correctness of that
precedent. Undoubtedly the United States benefits fromthis rule more often than other parties; but that is inevitably
true of most desirable rules of procedure or jurisdiction thatwe announce, the United States being the most frequent litigant in our courts. Since we announce the rule to be appli-cable to all parties; since we have recently applied a similar
rule (indeed, a rule even more broadly cast) to the disadvantage of the United States, see Stevens v. Department of
Treasury, 500 U. S. 1 (1991); and since the dissenters them-selves have approved the application of this rule (or a

broader one) in circumstances rationally indistinguishablefrom those before us, see n. 2, supra; the dissent's suggestion
that in deciding this case "the Court appears to favor theGovernment over the ordinary litigant," post, at 59, and
compromises its "obligation to administer justice impar-tially,"

ibid., needs no response.

Respondent does not contend that the Fifth Amendmentitself obliges the prosecutor to disclose substantial exculpatory evidence in his possession to the grand jury. Instead,building on our statement that the federal courts "may,

Hasting, 461 U. S. 499, 505 (1983), he argues that imposi-tion of the Tenth Circuit's disclosure rule is supported by the

courts' "supervisory power." We think not. Hasting, andthe cases that rely upon the principle it expresses, deal
strictly with the courts' power to control their own proce-dures. See, e. g., Jencks v. United States, 353 U. S. 657, 667-

the state supreme court actually considered and decided").

668 (1957); McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332 (1943).That power has been applied not only to improve the truthfinding process of the trial, see, e. g., Mesarosh v. UnitedStates, 352 U. S. 1, 9-14 (1956), but also to prevent parties
from reaping benefit or incurring harm from violations ofsubstantive or procedural rules (imposed by the Constitution
or laws) governing matters apart from the trial itself, see,
e. g., Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 (1914). Thus,Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U. S. 250 (1988),

makes clear that the supervisory power can be used to dis-miss an indictment because of misconduct before the grand
jury, at least where that misconduct amounts to a violationof one of those "few, clear rules which were carefully drafted
and approved by this Court and by Congress to ensure theintegrity of the grand jury's functions,"

United States v.Mechanik, 475 U. S. 66, 74 (1986) (
O'Connor, J., concurringin judgment).

We did not hold in Bank of Nova Scotia, however, that thecourts' supervisory power could be used, not merely as a

means of enforcing or vindicating legally compelled stand6 Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure contains a number
of such rules, providing, for example, that "no person other than the jurors
may be present while the grand jury is deliberating or voting," Rule 6(d),
and placing strict controls on disclosure of "matters occurring before the
grand jury," Rule 6(e); see generally United States v. Sells Engineering,
Inc., 463 U. S. 418 (1983). Additional standards of behavior for prosecutors (and others) are set forth in the United States Code. See 18 U. S. C.

$$ 6002, 6003 (setting forth procedures for granting a witness immunity
from prosecution); $ 1623 (criminalizing false declarations before grand
jury); $ 2515 (prohibiting grand jury use of unlawfully intercepted wire or
oral communications); $ 1622 (criminalizing subornation of perjury). That
some of the misconduct alleged in Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States,
487 U. S. 250 (1988), was not specifically proscribed by Rule, statute, or
the Constitution does not make the case stand for a judicially prescribable
grand jury code, as the dissent suggests, see post, at 64-65. All of the
allegations of violation were dismissed by the Court--without considering
their validity in law--for failure to meet Nova Scotia's dismissal standard.
See Bank of Nova Scotia, supra, at 261.

ards of prosecutorial conduct before the grand jury, but as a
means of prescribing those standards of prosecutorial conduct in the first instance--just as it may be used as a means
of establishing standards of prosecutorial conduct before the
courts themselves. It is this latter exercise that respondent
demands. Because the grand jury is an institution separate
from the courts, over whose functioning the courts do not
preside, we think it clear that, as a general matter at least,
no such "supervisory" judicial authority exists, and that the
disclosure rule applied here exceeded the Tenth Circuit's
authority.

A

"[R]ooted in long centuries of Anglo-American history,"
Hannah v. Larche, 363 U. S. 420, 490 (1960) (Frankfurter, J.,
concurring in result), the grand jury is mentioned in the Bill
of Rights, but not in the body of the Constitution. It has
not been textually assigned, therefore, to any of the branches
described in the first three Articles. It " `is a constitutional
fixture in its own right.' " United States v. Chanen, 549
F. 2d 1306, 1312 (CA9) (quoting Nixon v. Sirica, 159 U. S.

denied, 434 U. S. 825 (1977). In fact the whole theory of its
function is that it belongs to no branch of the institutional
Government, serving as a kind of buffer or referee between
the Government and the people. See Stirone v. United
States, 361 U. S. 212, 218 (1960); Hale v. Henkel, 201 U. S. 43,
61 (1906); G. Edwards, The Grand Jury 28-32 (1906). Although the grand jury normally operates, of course, in the
courthouse and under judicial auspices, its institutional relationship with the Judicial Branch has traditionally been, so
to speak, at arm's length. Judges' direct involvement in the
functioning of the grand jury has generally been confined to
the constitutive one of calling the grand jurors together and
administering their oaths of office. See United States v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338, 343 (1974); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 6(a).

48 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMS

Opinion of the Court
The grand jury's functional independence from the JudicialBranch is evident both in the scope of its power to investigate criminal wrongdoing and in the manner in which thatpower is exercised. "Unlike [a] [c]ourt, whose jurisdiction is
predicated upon a specific case or controversy, the grand jury
`can investigate merely on suspicion that the law is beingviolated, or even because it wants assurance that it is not.' "

United States v. R. Enterprises, Inc., 498 U. S. 292, 297(1991) (quoting

United States v. Morton Salt Co., 338 U. S.
632, 642-643 (1950)). It need not identify the offender itsuspects, or even "the precise nature of the offense" it is

investigating. Blair v. United States, 250 U. S. 273, 282
(1919). The grand jury requires no authorization from its
constituting court to initiate an investigation, see Hale,
supra, at 59-60, 65, nor does the prosecutor require leave of
court to seek a grand jury indictment. And in its day-today functioning, the grand jury generally operates without
the interference of a presiding judge. See Calandra, supra,
at 343. It swears in its own witnesses, Fed. Rule Crim.
Proc. 6(c), and deliberates in total secrecy, see United States
v. Sells Engineering, Inc., 463 U. S. 418, 424-425 (1983).

True, the grand jury cannot compel the appearance of
witnesses and the production of evidence, and must appeal
to the court when such compulsion is required. See, e. g.,
Brown v. United States, 359 U. S. 41, 49 (1959). And the
court will refuse to lend its assistance when the compulsion
the grand jury seeks would override rights accorded by the
Constitution, see, e. g., Gravel v. United States, 408 U. S. 606
(1972) (grand jury subpoena effectively qualified by order
limiting questioning so as to preserve Speech or Debate
Clause immunity), or even testimonial privileges recognized
by the common law, see In re Grand Jury Investigation of
Hugle, 754 F. 2d 863 (CA9 1985) (opinion of Kennedy, J.)
(same with respect to privilege for confidential marital communications). Even in this setting, however, we have insisted that the grand jury remain "free to pursue its investi504us1$68I 04-04-96 20:08:25 PAGES OPINPGT

gations unhindered by external influence or supervision solong as it does not trench upon the legitimate rights of any

witness called before it." United States v. Dionisio, 410U. S. 1, 17-18 (1973). Recognizing this tradition of independence, we have said that the Fifth Amendment's "constitutional guarantee presupposes an investigative body `actingindependently of either prosecuting attorney

or judge'. . . ."
Id., at 16 (emphasis added) (quoting Stirone, supra, at 218).No doubt in view of the grand jury proceeding's status as

other than a constituent element of a "criminal prosecu-tio[n]," U. S. Const., Amdt. 6, we have said that certain constitutional protections afforded defendants in criminal proceedings have no application before that body. The Double
Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not bar a
grand jury from returning an indictment when a prior grand
jury has refused to do so. See Ex parte United States, 287
U. S. 241, 250-251 (1932); United States v. Thompson, 251
U. S. 407, 413-415 (1920). We have twice suggested, though
not held, that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel does
not attach when an individual is summoned to appear before
a grand jury, even if he is the subject of the investigation.
See United States v. Mandujano, 425 U. S. 564, 581 (1976)
(plurality opinion); In re Groban, 352 U. S. 330, 333 (1957);
see also Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 6(d). And although "the
grand jury may not force a witness to answer questions in
violation of [the Fifth Amendment's] constitutional guarantee" against self-incrimination, Calandra, supra, at 346 (citing Kastigar v. United States, 406 U. S. 441 (1972)), our cases
suggest that an indictment obtained through the use of
evidence previously obtained in violation of the privilege
against self-incrimination "is nevertheless valid." Calandra, supra, at 346; see Lawn v. United States, 355 U. S. 339,
348-350 (1958); United States v. Blue, 384 U. S. 251, 255,
n. 3 (1966).

Given the grand jury's operational separateness from its
constituting court, it should come as no surprise that we

50 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMS

Opinion of the Court
have been reluctant to invoke the judicial supervisory power
as a basis for prescribing modes of grand jury procedure.
Over the years, we have received many requests to exercise
supervision over the grand jury's evidence-taking process,
but we have refused them all, including some more appealing
than the one presented today. In United States v. Calandra, supra, a grand jury witness faced questions that were
allegedly based upon physical evidence the Government had
obtained through a violation of the Fourth Amendment; we
rejected the proposal that the exclusionary rule be extended
to grand jury proceedings, because of "the potential injury
to the historic role and functions of the grand jury." 414
U. S., at 349. In Costello v. United States, 350 U. S. 359
(1956), we declined to enforce the hearsay rule in grand jury
proceedings, since that "would run counter to the whole
history of the grand jury institution, in which laymen conduct their inquiries unfettered by technical rules." Id., at
364.

These authorities suggest that any power federal courts
may have to fashion, on their own initiative, rules of grand
jury procedure is a very limited one, not remotely comparable to the power they maintain over their own proceedings.
See United States v. Chanen, 549 F. 2d, at 1313. It certainly
would not permit judicial reshaping of the grand jury institution, substantially altering the traditional relationships between the prosecutor, the constituting court, and the grand
jury itself. Cf., e. g., United States v. Payner, 447 U. S. 727,
736 (1980) (supervisory power may not be applied to permit
defendant to invoke third party's Fourth Amendment
rights); see generally Beale, Reconsidering Supervisory
Power in Criminal Cases: Constitutional and Statutory Limits on the Authority of the Federal Courts, 84 Colum. L. Rev.
1433, 1490-1494, 1522 (1984). As we proceed to discuss, that
would be the consequence of the proposed rule here.

Respondent argues that the Court of Appeals' rule canbe justified as a sort of Fifth Amendment "common law," a

necessary means of assuring the constitutional right to thejudgment "of an independent and informed grand jury,"
Wood v. Georgia, 370 U. S. 375, 390 (1962). Brief for Re-spondent 27. Respondent makes a generalized appeal to
functional notions: Judicial supervision of the quantity andquality of the evidence relied upon by the grand jury plainly
facilitates, he says, the grand jury's performance of its twinhistorical responsibilities, i. e., bringing to trial those who
may be justly accused and shielding the innocent from un-founded accusation and prosecution. See, e. g., Stirone v.
United States, 361 U. S., at 218, n. 3. We do not agree. Therule would neither preserve nor enhance the traditional functioning of the institution that the Fifth Amendment de-mands. To the contrary, requiring the prosecutor to present
exculpatory as well as inculpatory evidence would alter thegrand jury's historical role, transforming it from an accusatory to an adjudicatory body.It is axiomatic that the grand jury sits not to determine
guilt or innocence, but to assess whether there is adequatebasis for bringing a criminal charge. See

United States v.
Calandra, 414 U. S., at 343. That has always been so; andto make the assessment it has always been thought sufficient

to hear only the prosecutor's side. As Blackstone describedthe prevailing practice in 18th-century England, the grand
jury was "only to hear evidence on behalf of the prosecu-tion[,] for the finding of an indictment is only in the nature
of an enquiry or accusation, which is afterwards to be triedand determined." 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 300
(1769); see also 2 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 157 (1st Am.ed. 1847). So also in the United States. According to the
description of an early American court, three years beforethe Fifth Amendment was ratified, it is the grand jury's function not "to enquire . . . upon what foundation [the charge

Opinion of the Court
may be] denied," or otherwise to try the suspect's defenses,
but only to examine "upon what foundation [the charge] is
made" by the prosecutor. Respublica v. Shaffer, 1 Dall. 236
(O. T. Phila. 1788); see also F. Wharton, Criminal Pleading
and Practice $ 360, pp. 248-249 (8th ed. 1880). As a consequence, neither in this country nor in England has the suspect under investigation by the grand jury ever been thought
to have a right to testify or to have exculpatory evidence
presented. See 2 Hale, supra, at 157; United States ex rel.
McCann v. Thompson, 144 F. 2d 604, 605-606 (CA2), cert.
denied, 323 U. S. 790 (1944).

Imposing upon the prosecutor a legal obligation to present
exculpatory evidence in his possession would be incompatible
with this system. If a "balanced" assessment of the entire
matter is the objective, surely the first thing to be done--
rather than requiring the prosecutor to say what he knows
in defense of the target of the investigation--is to entitle the
target to tender his own defense. To require the former
while denying (as we do) the latter would be quite absurd.
It would also be quite pointless, since it would merely invite
the target to circumnavigate the system by delivering his
exculpatory evidence to the prosecutor, whereupon it would
have to be passed on to the grand jury--unless the prosecutor is willing to take the chance that a court will not deem
the evidence important enough to qualify for mandatory disclosure.7 See, e. g., United States v. Law Firm of Zimmerman & Schwartz, P. C., 738 F. Supp. 407, 411 (Colo. 1990)
(duty to disclose exculpatory evidence held satisfied when

7 How much of a gamble that is is illustrated by the Court of Appeals'
opinion in the present case. Though the court purported to be applying
the "substantial exculpatory" standard set forth in its prior Page decision,
see 899 F. 2d, at 900, portions of the opinion recite a much more inclusive
standard. See id., at 902 ("[T]he grand jury must receive any information
that is relevant to any reasonable [exculpatory] theory it may adopt"); ibid.
("We conclude, therefore, that the district court was not clearly in error
when it found that the deposition testimony was exculpatory").

aff 'd sub nom. United States v. Brown, 943 F. 2d 1246, 1257(CA10 1991).

Respondent acknowledges (as he must) that the "common
law" of the grand jury is not violated if the grand jury itselfchooses to hear no more evidence than that which suffices to

convince it an indictment is proper. Cf. Thompson, supra,at 607. Thus, had the Government offered to familiarize the
grand jury in this case with the five boxes of financial state-ments and deposition testimony alleged to contain exculpatory information, and had the grand jury rejected the offer
as pointless, respondent would presumably agree that the
resulting indictment would have been valid. Respondent
insists, however, that courts must require the modern prosecutor to alert the grand jury to the nature and extent of the
available exculpatory evidence, because otherwise the grand
jury "merely functions as an arm of the prosecution." Brief
for Respondent 27. We reject the attempt to convert a nonexistent duty of the grand jury itself into an obligation of
the prosecutor. The authority of the prosecutor to seek an
indictment has long been understood to be "coterminous with
the authority of the grand jury to entertain [the prosecutor's]
charges." United States v. Thompson, 251 U. S., at 414. If
the grand jury has no obligation to consider all "substantial
exculpatory" evidence, we do not understand how the prosecutor can be said to have a binding obligation to present it.

There is yet another respect in which respondent's proposal not only fails to comport with, but positively contradicts, the "common law" of the Fifth Amendment grand jury.
Motions to quash indictments based upon the sufficiency of
the evidence relied upon by the grand jury were unheard of
at common law in England, see, e. g., People v. Restenblatt,
1 Abb. Pr. 268, 269 (Ct. Gen. Sess. N. Y. 1855). And the
traditional American practice was described by Justice Nelson, riding circuit in 1852, as follows:

Opinion of the Court
"No case has been cited, nor have we been able to findany, furnishing an authority for looking into and revising

the judgment of the grand jury upon the evidence, forthe purpose of determining whether or not the finding
was founded upon sufficient proof, or whether there wasa deficiency in respect to any part of the complaint . . . ."
United States v. Reed, 27 F. Cas. 727, 738 (No. 16,134)(CC NDNY 1852).

We accepted Justice Nelson's description in Costello v.
United States, where we held that "[i]t would run counterto the whole history of the grand jury institution" to permit

an indictment to be challenged "on the ground that therewas inadequate or incompetent evidence before the grand
jury." 350 U. S., at 363-364. And we reaffirmed this prin-ciple recently in Bank of Nova Scotia, where we held that
"the mere fact that evidence itself is unreliable is not suffi-cient to require a dismissal of the indictment," and that "a
challenge to the reliability or competence of the evidencepresented to the grand jury" will not be heard. 487 U. S.,
at 261. It would make little sense, we think, to abstain fromreviewing the evidentiary support for the grand jury's judgment while scrutinizing the sufficiency of the prosecutor'spresentation. A complaint about the quality or adequacy of
the evidence can always be recast as a complaint that theprosecutor's presentation was "incomplete" or "misleading."

Our words in Costello bear repeating: Review of facially

reliance upon hearsay evidence the petitioner could have complained
about the prosecutor's introduction of it. See, e. g., United States v. Estepa, 471 F. 2d 1132, 1136-1137 (CA2 1972) (prosecutor should not introduce hearsay evidence before grand jury when direct evidence is available); see also Arenella, Reforming the Federal Grand Jury and the State

whole history of the grand jury institution[,] [and] [n]either

* * *

Echoing the reasoning of the Tenth Circuit in United
States v. Page, 808 F. 2d, at 728, respondent argues that a
rule requiring the prosecutor to disclose exculpatory evidence to the grand jury would, by removing from the docket
unjustified prosecutions, save valuable judicial time. That
depends, we suppose, upon what the ratio would turn out to
be between unjustified prosecutions eliminated and grand
jury indictments challenged--for the latter as well as the
former consume "valuable judicial time." We need not
pursue the matter; if there is an advantage to the proposal,
Congress is free to prescribe it. For the reasons set forth
above, however, we conclude that courts have no authority to
prescribe such a duty pursuant to their inherent supervisory
authority over their own proceedings. The judgment of the
Court of Appeals is accordingly reversed, and the cause
is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.

So ordered.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Blackmun and
Justice O'Connor join, and with whom Justice Thomas
joins as to Parts II and III, dissenting.

The Court's opinion announces two important changes in
the law. First, it justifies its special accommodation to the
Solicitor General in granting certiorari to review a contention that was not advanced in either the District Court or
the Court of Appeals by explaining that the fact that the
issue was raised in a different case is an adequate substitute
for raising it in this case. Second, it concludes that a federal
court has no power to enforce the prosecutor's obligation to

protect the fundamental fairness of proceedings before the
grand jury.

I

The question presented by the certiorari petition is
whether the failure to disclose substantial exculpatory evidence to the grand jury is a species of prosecutorial misconduct that may be remedied by dismissing an indictment
without prejudice. In the District Court and the Court of
Appeals both parties agreed that the answer to that question
is "yes, in an appropriate case." The only disagreement was
whether this was an appropriate case: The prosecutor vigorously argued that it was not because the undisclosed evidence was not substantial exculpatory evidence, while respondent countered that the evidence was exculpatory and
the prosecutor's misconduct warranted a dismissal with
prejudice.

In an earlier case arising in the Tenth Circuit, United
States v. Page, 808 F. 2d 723, cert. denied, 482 U. S. 918
(1987), the defendant had claimed that his indictment should
have been dismissed because the prosecutor was guilty of
misconduct during the grand jury proceedings. Specifically,
he claimed that the prosecutor had allowed the grand jury
to consider false testimony and had failed to present it with
substantial exculpatory evidence. 808 F. 2d, at 726-727.
After noting that there are "two views concerning the duty
of a prosecutor to present exculpatory evidence to a grand
jury," id., at 727, the court concluded that the "better, and
more balanced rule" is that "when substantial exculpatory
evidence is discovered in the course of an investigation, it
must be revealed to the grand jury," id., at 728 (emphasis
in original). The court declined to dismiss the indictment,
however, because the evidence withheld in that case was not
"clearly exculpatory." Ibid.

In this case the Government expressly acknowledged the
responsibilities described in Page, but argued that the with504us1$68I 04-04-96 20:08:25 PAGES OPINPGT

Stevens, J., dissenting
held evidence was not exculpatory or significant.1 Insteadof questioning the controlling rule of law, it distinguished the

facts of this case from those of an earlier case in which anindictment had been dismissed because the prosecutor had
withheld testimony that made it factually impossible for thecorporate defendant to have been guilty.

2 The Government

concluded its principal brief with a request that the courtapply the test set forth in

Bank of Nova Scotia v. UnitedStates, 487 U. S. 250 (1988), "follow the holding of Page," and

hold that dismissal was not warranted in this case becausethe withheld evidence was not substantial exculpatory evidence and respondent "was not prejudiced in any way."Brief for United States in No. 88-2827 (CA10), pp. 40-43.

After losing in the Court of Appeals, the Government re-versed its position and asked this Court to grant certiorari

1 "The government has acknowledged that it has certain responsibilities
under the case of United States v. Page, 808 F. 2d 723 (10th Cir. 1987), and
that includes a duty to not withhold substantial exculpatory evidence from
a grand jury if such exists. . . . The government would contend that . . . it
was familiar with and complied with the principles stated in the case. . . .
Considering the evidence as a whole, it is clear that the government complied with, and went beyond the requirements of Page, supra." Brief for
United States in Response to Appellee's Brief in Nos. 88-2827, 88-2843
(CA10), pp. 9-10.

2 Respondent had relied on United States v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 435

F. Supp. 610 (ND Okla. 1977). The Government distinguished the case
based on "the type of evidence excluded. In Phillips, supra, the prosecutor sent the Grand Jury home for the day, but continued questioning a
witness. In that session, outside the hearing of the Grand Jury members,
the witness, who had been granted use immunity, testified to certain information which showed that the witness had been the one who knowingly
committed an offense, and showed that the corporation had not intentionally committed an offense in that case. There was no question that the
withheld testimony made it factually impossible for the corporate defendant to have been guilty, and therefore the evidence was substantial and
exculpatory. In the instant case there is a disagreement between the government and the defendant as to whether the documents the defendant
wants presented in full are exculpatory." Brief for United States in No.
88-2827 (CA10), p. 38.

reiterated the general rule that precludes a grant of certio-rari when the question presented was "not pressed or passed

General's petition. 502 U. S. 905 (1991).The Court explains that the settled rule does not apply to
the Government's certiorari petition in this case because theGovernment raised the same question three years earlier in
the Page case and the Court of Appeals passed on the issue
in that case. Ante, at 44-45. This is a novel, and unwise,

United States v. Lovasco, 431 U. S. 783, 788, n. 7 (1977); United States
v. Ortiz, 422 U. S. 891, 898 (1975). Until today the Court has never
suggested that the fact that an argument was pressed by the litigant or
passed on by the court of appeals in a different case would satisfy this
requirement.

4 Stevens v. Department of Treasury, 500 U. S. 1 (1991), and Virginia

Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U. S. 1083 (1991), discussed by the
Court, ante, at 41-42, were routine applications of the settled rule. Although the parties may not have raised the questions presented in the
petitions for certiorari before the Courts of Appeals in those cases, the
courts treated the questions as open questions that they needed to resolve
in order to decide the cases. Similarly, in Springfield v. Kibbe, 480 U. S.
257 (1987), the Court of Appeals had expressly considered and answered
the question that Justice O'Connor thought we should decide, see id., at
263-266. This case, in contrast, involved "the routine restatement and
application of settled law by an appellate court," which we have previously
found insufficient to satisfy the "pressed or passed upon below" rule. Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 222-223 (1983).

change in the rule. We have never suggested that the fact
that a court has repeated a settled proposition of law and
applied it, without objection, in the case at hand provides a
sufficient basis for our review.5 See Illinois v. Gates, 462
U. S. 213, 222-223 (1983), and cases cited therein. If this is
to be the rule in the future, it will either provide a basis
for a significant expansion of our discretionary docket 6 or, if
applied only to benefit repetitive litigants, a special privilege
for the Federal Government.

This Court has a special obligation to administer justice
impartially and to set an example of impartiality for other
courts to emulate. When the Court appears to favor the
Government over the ordinary litigant, it seriously compromises its ability to discharge that important duty. For that

5 The Court expresses an inability to understand the difference between
the routine application, without objection, of a settled rule, on the one
hand, and the decision of an open question on a ground not argued by the
parties, on the other. The difference is best explained in light of the basic
assumption that the adversary process provides the best method of arriving at correct decisions. Rules of appellate practice generally require
that an issue be actually raised and debated by the parties if it is to be
preserved. In the exceptional case, in which an appellate court announces
a new rule that had not been debated by the parties, our review may be
appropriate to give the losing party an opportunity it would not otherwise
have to challenge the rule. In this case, however, there is no reason why
the Government could not have challenged the Page rule in this case in
the Tenth Circuit. There is no need for an exception to preserve the
losing litigant's opportunity to be heard. Moreover, the Government's
failure to object to the application of the Page rule deprived the Court of
Appeals of an opportunity to reexamine the validity of that rule in the
light of intervening developments in the law. "Sandbagging" is just as
improper in an appellate court as in a trial court.

6 The "expressed or passed on" predicate for the exercise of our jurisdiction is of special importance in determining our power to review statecourt judgments. If the Court's newly announced view that the routine
application of a settled rule satisfies the "passed on" requirement in a
federal case, I see no reason why it should not also satisfy the same requirement in a state case.

Like the Hydra slain by Hercules, prosecutorial miscon-duct has many heads. Some are cataloged in Justice Sutherland's classic opinion for the Court in Berger v. United States,295 U. S. 78 (1935):

"That the United States prosecuting attorney over-stepped the bounds of that propriety and fairness which
should characterize the conduct of such an officer in theprosecution of a criminal offense is clearly shown by the
record. He was guilty of misstating the facts in hiscross-examination of witnesses; of putting into the
mouths of such witnesses things which they had notsaid; of suggesting by his questions that statements had
been made to him personally out of court, in respect ofwhich no proof was offered; of pretending to understand
that a witness had said something which he had not saidand persistently cross-examining the witness upon that
basis; of assuming prejudicial facts not in evidence; of
7 The Court suggests that it would be "improvident" for the Court to
dismiss the writ of certiorari on the ground that the Government failed to
raise the question presented in the lower courts because respondent raised
this argument in his brief in opposition, the Court nevertheless granted
the writ, and the case has been briefed and argued. Ante, at 40. I disagree. The vote of four Justices is sufficient to grant a petition for certiorari, but that action does not preclude a majority of the Court from dismissing the writ as improvidently granted after the case has been argued.
See, e. g., NAACP v. Overstreet, 384 U. S. 118 (1966) (dismissing, after oral
argument, writ as improvidently granted over the dissent of four Justices).
We have frequently dismissed the writ as improvidently granted after the
case has been briefed and argued; in fact, we have already done so twice
this Term. See Gibson v. Florida Bar, 502 U. S. 104 (1991); PFZ Properties, Inc. v. Rodriguez, 503 U. S. 257 (1992). Although we do not always
explain the reason for the dismissal, we have on occasion dismissed the
writ for the reasons raised by the respondent in the brief in opposition.
Thus, nothing precludes the Court from dismissing the writ in this case.

bullying and arguing with witnesses; and in general, ofconducting himself in a thoroughly indecorous and improper manner. . . ."The prosecuting attorney's argument to the jury was
undignified and intemperate, containing improper insin-uations and assertions calculated to mislead the jury."
Id., at 84-85.
This, of course, is not an exhaustive list of the kinds ofimproper tactics that overzealous or misguided prosecutors

have adopted in judicial proceedings. The reported casesof this Court alone contain examples of the knowing use of
perjured testimony, Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U. S. 103 (1935),the suppression of evidence favorable to an accused person,
Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, 87-88 (1963), and misstate-ments of the law in argument to the jury, Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320, 336 (1985), to name just a few.Nor has prosecutorial misconduct been limited to judicial
proceedings: The reported cases indicate that it has some-times infected grand jury proceedings as well. The cases
contain examples of prosecutors presenting perjured testi-mony,

examination of a witness, United States v. Lawson, 502F. Supp. 158, 162, and nn. 6-7 (Md. 1980).

Justice Sutherland's identification of the basic reason whythat sort of misconduct is intolerable merits repetition:

"The United States Attorney is the representative notof an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as com-pelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that itshall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such,
he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant ofthe law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not
escape or innocence suffer. He may prosecute withearnestness and vigor--indeed, he should do so. But,
while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty tostrike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from
improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful con-viction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring
about a just one." Berger v. United States, 295 U. S.,at 88.

It is equally clear that the prosecutor has the same dutyto refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a
wrongful indictment. Indeed, the prosecutor's duty to pro-tect the fundamental fairness of judicial proceedings assumes
special importance when he is presenting evidence to a grandjury. As the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit recognized, "the costs of continued unchecked prosecutorial mis-conduct" before the grand jury are particularly substantial
because there

"the prosecutor operates without the check of a judgeor a trained legal adversary, and virtually immune from

public scrutiny. The prosecutor's abuse of his special
the polygraph evidence was inadmissible." United States v. Roberts, 481
F. Supp., at 1389.

relationship to the grand jury poses an enormous risk to
defendants as well. For while in theory a trial provides
the defendant with a full opportunity to contest and
disprove the charges against him, in practice, the handing up of an indictment will often have a devastating
personal and professional impact that a later dismissal
or acquittal can never undo. Where the potential for
abuse is so great, and the consequences of a mistaken
indictment so serious, the ethical responsibilities of the
prosecutor, and the obligation of the judiciary to protect
against even the appearance of unfairness, are correspondingly heightened." United States v. Serubo, 604
F. 2d 807, 817 (1979).

In his dissent in United States v. Ciambrone, 601 F. 2d 616
(CA2 1979), Judge Friendly also recognized the prosecutor's
special role in grand jury proceedings:

"As the Supreme Court has noted, `the Founders
thought the grand jury so essential to basic liberties that
they provided in the Fifth Amendment that federal
prosecution for serious crimes can only be instituted
by "a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury." '
United States v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338, 343, . . . (1974).
Before the grand jury the prosecutor has the dual role
of pressing for an indictment and of being the grand jury
adviser. In case of conflict, the latter duty must take
precedence. United States v. Remington, 208 F. 2d 567,
573-74 (2d Cir. 1953) (L. Hand, J., dissenting), cert.
denied, 347 U. S. 913 . . . (1954).

"The ex parte character of grand jury proceedings
makes it peculiarly important for a federal prosecutor
to remember that, in the familiar phrase, the interest of
the United States `in a criminal prosecution is not that
it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.'

Id., at 628-629.9

The standard for judging the consequences of prosecutorial misconduct during grand jury proceedings is essentially
the same as the standard applicable to trials. In United
States v. Mechanik, 475 U. S. 66 (1986), we held that there
was "no reason not to apply [the harmless error rule] to `er-rors, defects, irregularities, or variances' occurring before a

grand jury just as we have applied it to such error occurringin the criminal trial itself,"

id., at 71-72. We repeated that
holding in Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U. S.
250 (1988), when we rejected a defendant's argument thatan indictment should be dismissed because of prosecutorial

misconduct and irregularities in proceedings before thegrand jury. Referring to the prosecutor's misconduct before
the grand jury, we "concluded that our customary harmless-error inquiry is applicable where, as in the cases before us,
a court is asked to dismiss an indictment prior to the conclu-sion of the trial."

Id., at 256. Moreover, in reviewing the
instances of misconduct in that case, we applied precisely the

9 Although the majority in Ciambrone did not agree with Judge Friendly's appraisal of the prejudicial impact of the misconduct in that case, it
also recognized the prosecutor's duty to avoid fundamentally unfair tactics
during the grand jury proceedings. Judge Mansfield explained:

"On the other hand, the prosecutor's right to exercise some discretion
and selectivity in the presentation of evidence to a grand jury does not
entitle him to mislead it or to engage in fundamentally unfair tactics before it. The prosecutor, for instance, may not obtain an indictment on the
basis of evidence known to him to be perjurious, United States v. Basurto,
497 F. 2d 781, 785-86 (9th Cir. 1974), or by leading it to believe that it has
received eyewitness rather than hearsay testimony, United States v. Estepa, 471 F. 2d 1132, 1136-37 (2d Cir. 1972). We would add that where a
prosecutor is aware of any substantial evidence negating guilt he should,
in the interest of justice, make it known to the grand jury, at least where
it might reasonably be expected to lead the jury not to indict. See ABA
Project on Standards for Criminal Justice--the Prosecution Function,

$ 3.6, pp. 90-91." 601 F. 2d, at 623.

Stevens, J., dissenting
same standard to the prosecutor's violations of Rule 6 of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and to his violations of
the general duty of fairness that applies to all judicial proceedings. This point is illustrated by the Court's comments
on the prosecutor's abuse of a witness:

"The District Court found that a prosecutor was abusive to an expert defense witness during a recess and in
the hearing of some grand jurors. Although the Government concedes that the treatment of the expert tax
witness was improper, the witness himself testified that
his testimony was unaffected by this misconduct. The
prosecutors instructed the grand jury to disregard anything they may have heard in conversations between a
prosecutor and a witness, and explained to the grand
jury that such conversations should have no influence on
its deliberations. App. 191. In light of these ameliorative measures, there is nothing to indicate that the
prosecutor's conduct toward this witness substantially
affected the grand jury's evaluation of the testimony or
its decision to indict." 487 U. S., at 261.

Unquestionably, the plain implication of that discussion is
that if the misconduct, even though not expressly forbidden
by any written rule, had played a critical role in persuading
the jury to return the indictment, dismissal would have
been required.

In an opinion that I find difficult to comprehend, the Court
today repudiates the assumptions underlying these cases and
seems to suggest that the court has no authority to supervise
the conduct of the prosecutor in grand jury proceedings so
long as he follows the dictates of the Constitution, applicable
statutes, and Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Court purports to support this conclusion by invoking the doctrine of separation of powers and citing a
string of cases in which we have declined to impose categori504us1$68I 04-04-96 20:08:25 PAGES OPINPGT

Stevens, J., dissenting
cal restraints on the grand jury. Needless to say, theCourt's reasoning is unpersuasive.

Although the grand jury has not been "textually assigned"to "any of the branches described in the first three Articles"
of the Constitution, ante, at 47, it is not an autonomous
body completely beyond the reach of the other branches.Throughout its life, from the moment it is convened until it is

discharged, the grand jury is subject to the control of the court.As Judge Learned Hand recognized over 60 years ago, "a
grand jury is neither an officer nor an agent of the UnitedStates, but a part of the court."

Falter v. United States, 23
F. 2d 420, 425 (CA2), cert. denied, 277 U. S. 590 (1928). ThisCourt has similarly characterized the grand jury:

"A grand jury is clothed with great independence inmany areas, but it remains an appendage of the court,
powerless to perform its investigative function withoutthe court's aid, because powerless itself to compel the
testimony of witnesses. It is the court's process which
summons the witness to attend and give testimony, andit is the court which must compel a witness to testify if,

after appearing, he refuses to do so." Brown v. United

States, 359 U. S. 41, 49 (1959).

See also Blair v. United States, 250 U. S. 273, 280 (1919) ("At
the foundation of our Federal Government the inquisitorial
function of the grand jury and the compulsion of witnesseswere recognized as incidents of the judicial power of the

United States"); United States v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338,346, and n. 4 (1974).

This Court has, of course, long recognized that the grand
jury has wide latitude to investigate violations of federal law
as it deems appropriate and need not obtain permission from
either the court or the prosecutor. See, e. g., id., at 343; Costello v. United States, 350 U. S. 359, 362 (1956); Hale v.
Henkel, 201 U. S. 43, 65 (1906). Correspondingly, we have
acknowledged that "its operation generally is unrestrained

by the technical procedural and evidentiary rules governingthe conduct of criminal trials." Calandra, 414 U. S., at 343.

But this is because Congress and the Court have generallythought it best not to impose procedural restraints on the
grand jury; it is not because they lack all power to do so.10To the contrary, the Court has recognized that it has the
authority to create and enforce limited rules applicable ingrand jury proceedings. Thus, for example, the Court has
said that the grand jury "may not itself violate a valid privi-lege, whether established by the Constitution, statutes, or
the common law." Id., at 346. And the Court may preventa grand jury from violating such a privilege by quashing or
modifying a subpoena, id., at 346, n. 4, or issuing a protec-tive order forbidding questions in violation of the privilege,
Gravel v. United States, 408 U. S. 606, 628-629 (1972). More-over, there are, as the Court notes, ante, at 49, a series of
cases in which we declined to impose categorical restraintson the grand jury. In none of those cases, however, did we
question our power to reach a contrary result.11Although the Court recognizes that it may invoke its supervisory authority to fashion and enforce privilege rulesapplicable in grand jury proceedings, ibid., and suggests that

10 Indeed, even the Court acknowledges that Congress has the power to
regulate the grand jury, for it concedes that Congress "is free to prescribe"
a rule requiring the prosecutor to disclose substantial exculpatory evidence to the grand jury. Ante, at 55.

11 In Costello v. United States, 350 U. S. 359, 363 (1956), for example, the

Court held that an indictment based solely on hearsay evidence is not
invalid under the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The Court
then rejected the petitioner's argument that it should invoke "its power
to supervise the administration of justice in federal courts" to create a
rule permitting defendants to challenge indictments based on unreliable
hearsay evidence. The Court declined to exercise its power in this way
because "[n]o persuasive reasons are advanced for establishing such a rule.
It would run counter to the whole history of the grand jury institution, in
which laymen conduct their inquiries unfettered by technical rules. Neither justice nor the concept of a fair trial requires such a change." Id.,

it may also invoke its supervisory authority to fashion otherlimited rules of grand jury procedure,

ante, at 48-49, it concludes that it has no authority to prescribe "standards of prose-cutorial conduct before the grand jury,"

ante, at 46-47, because that would alter the grand jury's historic role as an
independent, inquisitorial institution. I disagree.We do not protect the integrity and independence of the

grand jury by closing our eyes to the countless forms ofprosecutorial misconduct that may occur inside the secrecy
of the grand jury room. After all, the grand jury is notmerely an investigatory body; it also serves as a "protector
of citizens against arbitrary and oppressive governmentalaction."

United States v. Calandra, 414 U. S., at 343. Explaining why the grand jury must be both "independent"
and "informed," the Court wrote in Wood v. Georgia, 370U. S. 375 (1962):

"Historically, this body has been regarded as a primary security to the innocent against hasty, malicious
and oppressive persecution; it serves the invaluablefunction in our society of standing between the accuser

and the accused, whether the latter be an individual, mi-nority group, or other, to determine whether a charge is
founded upon reason or was dictated by an intimidatingpower or by malice and personal ill will."

Id., at 390.

It blinks reality to say that the grand jury can adequatelyperform this important historic role if it is intentionally misled by the prosecutor--on whose knowledge of the law andfacts of the underlying criminal investigation the jurors will,
of necessity, rely.

Unlike the Court, I am unwilling to hold that countless
forms of prosecutorial misconduct must be tolerated--no
matter how prejudicial they may be, or how seriously they
may distort the legitimate function of the grand jury--simply because they are not proscribed by Rule 6 of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure or a statute that is applicable

in grand jury proceedings. Such a sharp break with the tra-ditional role of the federal judiciary is unprecedented, unwarranted, and unwise. Unrestrained prosecutorial misconductin grand jury proceedings is inconsistent with the administration of justice in the federal courts and should be re-dressed in appropriate cases by the dismissal of indictments
obtained by improper methods.12

III
What, then, is the proper disposition of this case? I agreewith the Government that the prosecutor is not required to

place all exculpatory evidence before the grand jury. Agrand jury proceeding is an ex parte investigatory proceeding to determine whether there is probable cause to believea violation of the criminal laws has occurred, not a trial.
Requiring the prosecutor to ferret out and present all evi-dence that could be used at trial to create a reasonable doubt
as to the defendant's guilt would be inconsistent with thepurpose of the grand jury proceeding and would place significant burdens on the investigation. But that does notmean that the prosecutor may mislead the grand jury into
believing that there is probable cause to indict by withhold-ing clear evidence to the contrary. I thus agree with the
Department of Justice that "when a prosecutor conducting agrand jury inquiry is personally aware of substantial evidence which directly negates the guilt of a subject of theinvestigation, the prosecutor must present or otherwise dis12 Although the Court's opinion barely mentions the fact that the grand
jury was intended to serve the invaluable function of standing between
the accuser and the accused, I must assume that in a proper case it will
acknowledge--as even the Solicitor General does--that unrestrained
prosecutorial misconduct in grand jury proceedings "could so subvert the
integrity of the grand jury process as to justify judicial intervention. Cf.
Franks v. Delaware, 438 U. S. 154, 164-171 (1978) (discussing analogous
considerations in holding that a search warrant affidavit may be challenged when supported by deliberately false police statements)." Brief

close such evidence to the grand jury before seeking an in-dictment against such a person." U. S. Dept. of Justice,

United States Attorneys' Manual || 9-11.233, p. 88 (1988).Although I question whether the evidence withheld in this
case directly negates respondent's guilt,13 I need not resolvemy doubts because the Solicitor General did not ask the
Court to review the nature of the evidence withheld. In-stead, he asked us to decide the legal question whether an
indictment may be dismissed because the prosecutor failedto present exculpatory evidence. Unlike the Court and the
Solicitor General, I believe the answer to that question isyes, if the withheld evidence would plainly preclude a finding
of probable cause. I therefore cannot endorse the Court'sopinion.

More importantly, because I am so firmly opposed to theCourt's favored treatment of the Government as a litigator,
I would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidentlygranted.

13 I am reluctant to rely on the lower courts' judgment in this regard,
as they apparently applied a more lenient legal standard. The District
Court dismissed the indictment because the "information withheld raises
reasonable doubt about the Defendant's intent to defraud," and thus "renders the grand jury's decision to indict gravely suspect." App. to Pet. for
Cert. 26a. The Court of Appeals affirmed this decision because it was not
"clearly erroneous." 899 F. 2d 898, 902-904 (CA10 1990).

71OCTOBER TERM, 1991
Syllabus

FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA
certiorari to the supreme court of louisiana
No. 90-5844. Argued November 4, 1991--Decided May 18, 1992
Under Louisiana law, a criminal defendant found not guilty by reason of

insanity may be committed to a psychiatric hospital. If a hospital review committee thereafter recommends that the acquittee be released,
the trial court must hold a hearing to determine whether he is dangerous to himself or others. If he is found to be dangerous, he may be
returned to the hospital whether or not he is then mentally ill. Pursuant to this statutory scheme, a state court ordered petitioner Foucha,
an insanity acquittee, returned to the mental institution to which he had
been committed, ruling that he was dangerous on the basis of, inter
alia, a doctor's testimony that he had recovered from the drug induced
psychosis from which he suffered upon commitment and was "in good
shape" mentally; that he had, however, an antisocial personality, a condition that is not a mental disease and is untreatable; that he had been
involved in several altercations at the institution; and that, accordingly,
the doctor would not "feel comfortable in certifying that he would not
be a danger to himself or to other people." The State Court of Appeal
refused supervisory writs, and the State Supreme Court affirmed, holding, among other things, that Jones v. United States, 463 U. S. 354, did
not require Foucha's release and that the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment was not violated by the statutory provision
permitting confinement of an insanity acquittee based on dangerousness alone.

Held: The judgment is reversed.
563 So. 2d 1138, reversed.

Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I and II, concluding that the Louisiana statute violates the Due
Process Clause because it allows an insanity acquittee to be committed
to a mental institution until he is able to demonstrate that he is not
dangerous to himself and others, even though he does not suffer from
any mental illness. Although Jones, supra, acknowledged that an insanity acquittee could be committed, the Court also held that, as a matter of due process, he is entitled to release when he has recovered his
sanity or is no longer dangerous, id., at 368, i. e., he may be held as long
as he is both mentally ill and dangerous, but no longer. Here, since the
State does not contend that Foucha was mentally ill at the time of the

72 FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA

Syllabus
trial court's hearing, the basis for holding him in a psychiatric facility
as an insanity acquittee has disappeared, and the State is no longer
entitled to hold him on that basis. There are at least three difficulties
with the State's attempt to perpetuate his confinement on the basis of
his antisocial personality. First, even if his continued confinement were
constitutionally permissible, keeping him against his will in a mental
institution is improper absent a determination in civil commitment proceedings of current mental illness and dangerousness. Vitek v. Jones,
445 U. S. 480, 492. Due process requires that the nature of commitment
bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual is
committed. See, e. g., Jones v. United States, supra, at 368. Second,
if he can no longer be held as an insanity acquittee in a mental hospital, he is entitled to constitutionally adequate procedures to establish
the grounds for his confinement. Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U. S. 715.
Third, the substantive component of the Due Process Clause bars certain arbitrary, wrongful government actions regardless of the fairness
of the procedures used to implement them. Zinermon v. Burch, 494

U. S. 113, 125. Although a State may imprison convicted criminals for
the purposes of deterrence and retribution, Louisiana has no such interest here, since Foucha was not convicted and may not be punished.
Jones, 463 U. S., at 369. Moreover, although the State may confine a
person if it shows by clear and convincing evidence that he is mentally
ill and dangerous, id., at 362, Louisiana has not carried that burden here.
Furthermore, United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739--in which this
Court held that in certain narrow circumstances pretrial detainees who
pose a danger to others or the community may be subject to limited
confinement--does not save the state statute. Unlike the sharply focused statutory scheme at issue in Salerno, the Louisiana scheme is not
carefully limited. Pp. 75-85.

Pamela S. Moran argued the cause for respondent. Withher on the brief was Harry F. Connick.*

Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court, ex-cept as to Part III.
When a defendant in a criminal case pending in Louisianais found not guilty by reason of insanity, he is committed to
a psychiatric hospital unless he proves that he is not danger-ous. This is so whether or not he is then insane. After
commitment, if the acquittee or the superintendent beginsrelease proceedings, a review panel at the hospital makes a
written report on the patient's mental condition and whetherhe can be released without danger to himself or others. If
release is recommended, the court must hold a hearing todetermine dangerousness; the acquittee has the burden of
proving that he is not dangerous. If found to be dangerous,the acquittee may be returned to the mental institution
whether or not he is then mentally ill. Petitioner contendsthat this scheme denies him due process and equal protection
because it allows a person acquitted by reason of insanityto be committed to a mental institution until he is able to
demonstrate that he is not dangerous to himself and others,even though he does not suffer from any mental illness.

Opinion of the Court
guish right from wrong and was insane at the time of theoffense.

1 On October 12, 1984, the trial court ruled that

Foucha was not guilty by reason of insanity, finding that he"is unable to appreciate the usual, natural and probable consequences of his acts; that he is unable to distinguish rightfrom wrong; that he is a menace to himself and others; and
that he was insane at the time of the commission of the abovecrimes and that he is presently insane."

Id., at 6. He wascommitted to the East Feliciana Forensic Facility until such

time as doctors recommend that he be released, and untilfurther order of the court. In 1988, the superintendent of
Feliciana recommended that Foucha be discharged or re-leased. A three-member panel was convened at the institution to determine Foucha's current condition and whether hecould be released or placed on probation without being a
danger to others or himself. On March 21, 1988, the panelreported that there had been no evidence of mental illness
since admission and recommended that Foucha be condition-ally discharged.

2 The trial judge appointed a two-member

sanity commission made up of the same two doctors who hadconducted the pretrial examination. Their written report

stated that Foucha "is presently in remission from mentalillness [but] [w]e cannot certify that he would not constitute

1 Louisiana law provides: "If the circumstances indicate that because of
a mental disease or mental defect the offender was incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong with reference to the conduct in question, the offender shall be exempt from criminal responsibility." La. Rev.
Stat. Ann. $ 14:14 (West 1986). Justice Kennedy disregards the fact
that the State makes no claim that Foucha was criminally responsible or
that it is entitled to punish Foucha as a criminal.

2 The panel unanimously recommended that petitioner be conditionally

discharged with recommendations that he (1) be placed on probation; (2)
remain free from intoxicating and mind-altering substances; (3) attend a
substance abuse clinic on a regular basis; (4) submit to regular and random
urine drug screening; and (5) be actively employed or seeking employment. App. 10-11.

Although the panel recited that it was charged with determining dangerousness, its report did not expressly make a finding in that regard.

a menace to himself or others if released." Id., at 12. Oneof the doctors testified at a hearing that upon commitment

Foucha probably suffered from a drug induced psychosis butthat he had recovered from that temporary condition; that
he evidenced no signs of psychosis or neurosis and was in"good shape" mentally; that he had, however, an antisocial
personality, a condition that is not a mental disease and thatis untreatable. The doctor also testified that Foucha had
been involved in several altercations at Feliciana and thathe, the doctor, would not "feel comfortable in certifying that
[Foucha] would not be a danger to himself or to other peo-ple."

Id., at 18.After it was stipulated that the other doctor, if he were

present, would give essentially the same testimony, the courtruled that Foucha was dangerous to himself and others and
ordered him returned to the mental institution. The Courtof Appeal refused supervisory writs, and the State Supreme
Court affirmed, holding that Foucha had not carried the bur-den placed upon him by statute to prove that he was not
dangerous, that our decision in Jones v. United States, 463U. S. 354 (1983), did not require Foucha's release, and that
neither the Due Process Clause nor the Equal ProtectionClause was violated by the statutory provision permitting
confinement of an insanity acquittee based on dangerous-ness alone.

Because the case presents an important issue and was de-cided by the court below in a manner arguably at odds with
prior decisions of this Court, we granted certiorari. 499U. S. 946 (1991).

Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418 (1979), held that to com-mit an individual to a mental institution in a civil proceeding,

the State is required by the Due Process Clause to prove byclear and convincing evidence the two statutory preconditions to commitment: that the person sought to be committedis mentally ill and that he requires hospitalization for his

own welfare and protection of others. Proof beyond a rea-sonable doubt was not required, but proof by preponderance

of the evidence fell short of satisfying due process.3When a person charged with having committed a crime is
found not guilty by reason of insanity, however, a State maycommit that person without satisfying the

Addington burdenwith respect to mental illness and dangerousness. Jones v.

United States, supra. Such a verdict, we observed in Jones,"establishes two facts: (i) the defendant committed an act
that constitutes a criminal offense, and (ii) he committed theact because of mental illness," id., at 363, an illness that the
defendant adequately proved in this context by a preponder-ance of the evidence. From these two facts, it could be
properly inferred that at the time of the verdict, the defend-ant was still mentally ill and dangerous and hence could be
committed.4

3 Justice Thomas in dissent complains that Foucha should not be released based on psychiatric opinion that he is not mentally ill because
such opinion is not sufficiently precise--because psychiatry is not an exact
science and psychiatrists widely disagree on what constitutes a mental illness. That may be true, but such opinion is reliable enough to permit the
courts to base civil commitments on clear and convincing medical evidence
that a person is mentally ill and dangerous and to base release decisions
on qualified testimony that the person is no longer mentally ill or dangerous. It is also reliable enough for the State not to punish a person
who by a preponderance of the evidence is found to have been insane at
the time he committed a criminal act, to say nothing of not trying a person
who is at the time found incompetent to understand the proceedings.
And more to the point, medical predictions of dangerousness seem to be
reliable enough for Justice Thomas to permit the State to continue to
hold Foucha in a mental institution, even where the psychiatrist would say
no more than that he would hesitate to certify that Foucha would not be
dangerous to himself or others.

4 Justice Kennedy's assertion that we overrule the holding of Jones

described in the above paragraph is fanciful at best. As that paragraph
plainly shows, we do not question and fully accept that insanity acquittees
may be initially held without complying with the procedures applicable to
civil committees. As is evident from the ensuing paragraph of the text,
we are also true to the further holding of Jones that both Justice Thomas

Opinion of the Court
We held, however, that "[t]he committed acquittee is entitled to release when he has recovered his sanity or is no
longer dangerous," id., at 368; i. e., the acquittee may be held
as long as he is both mentally ill and dangerous, but no
longer. We relied on O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U. S. 563
(1975), which held as a matter of due process that it was
unconstitutional for a State to continue to confine a harmless,
mentally ill person. Even if the initial commitment was permissible, "it could not constitutionally continue after that
basis no longer existed." Id., at 575. In the summary of
our holdings in our opinion we stated that "the Constitution
permits the Government, on the basis of the insanity judgand Justice Kennedy reject: that the period of time during which an
insanity acquittee may be held in a mental institution is not measured by
the length of a sentence that might have been imposed had he been convicted; rather, the acquittee may be held until he is either not mentally ill
or not dangerous. Both Justices would permit the indefinite detention of
the acquittee, although the State concedes that he is not mentally ill and
although the doctors at the mental institution recommend his release, for
no reason other than that a psychiatrist hesitates to certify that the acquittee would not be dangerous to himself or others.

Justice Kennedy asserts that we should not entertain the proposition
that a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity differs from a conviction.
Post, at 94. Jones, however, involved a case where the accused had been
"found, beyond a reasonable doubt, to have committed a criminal act."
463 U. S., at 364. We did not find this sufficient to negate any difference
between a conviction and an insanity acquittal. Rather, we observed that
a person convicted of crime may of course be punished. But "[d]ifferent
considerations underlie commitment of an insanity acquittee. As he was
not convicted, he may not be punished." Id., at 369.

Justice Kennedy observes that proof beyond reasonable doubt of the
commission of a criminal act permits a State to incarcerate and hold the
offender on any reasonable basis. There is no doubt that the States have
wide discretion in determining punishment for convicted offenders, but
the Eighth Amendment ensures that discretion is not unlimited. The Justice cites no authority, but surely would have if it existed, for the proposition that a defendant convicted of a crime and sentenced to a term of years
may nevertheless be held indefinitely because of the likelihood that he will
commit other crimes.

ment, to confine him to a mental institution until such timeas he has regained his sanity or is no longer a danger to

himself or society." Jones, 463 U. S., at 368, 370.5 Thecourt below was in error in characterizing the above language from Jones as merely an interpretation of the perti-nent statutory law in the District of Columbia and as having
no constitutional significance. In this case, Louisiana doesnot contend that Foucha was mentally ill at the time of the
trial court's hearing. Thus, the basis for holding Foucha ina psychiatric facility as an insanity acquittee has disappeared, and the State is no longer entitled to hold him onthat basis.

O'Connor, supra, at 574-575.The State, however, seeks to perpetuate Foucha's confinement at Feliciana on the basis of his antisocial personalitywhich, as evidenced by his conduct at the facility, the court
found rendered him a danger to himself or others. There
are at least three difficulties with this position. First, evenif his continued confinement were constitutionally permissible, keeping Foucha against his will in a mental institutionis improper absent a determination in civil commitment
proceedings of current mental illness and dangerousness. In
Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S. 480 (1980), we held that a convictedfelon serving his sentence has a liberty interest, not extinguished by his confinement as a criminal, in not being trans-ferred to a mental institution and hence classified as men5 Justice Thomas, dissenting, suggests that there was no issue of the
standards for release before us in Jones. The issue in that case, however,
was whether an insanity acquittee "must be released because he has been
hospitalized for a period longer than he might have served in prison had
he been convicted," 463 U. S., at 356; and in the course of deciding that
issue in the negative, we said that the detainee could be held until he was
no longer mentally ill or no longer dangerous, regardless of how long a
prison sentence might have been. We noted in footnote 11 that Jones
had not sought a release based on nonillness or nondangerousness, but as
indicated in the text, we twice announced the outside limits on the detention of insanity acquittees. The Justice would "wish" away this aspect of
Jones, but that case merely reflected the essence of our prior decisions.

tally ill without appropriate procedures to prove that he was
mentally ill. "The loss of liberty produced by an involuntary commitment is more than a loss of freedom from
confinement." Id., at 492. Due process requires that the
nature of commitment bear some reasonable relation to
the purpose for which the individual is committed. Jones,
supra, at 368; Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U. S. 715, 738 (1972).
Here, according to the testimony given at the hearing in the
trial court, Foucha is not suffering from a mental disease or
illness. If he is to be held, he should not be held as a mentally ill person. See Jones, supra, at 368; Jackson, supra,
at 738. Cf. United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 747-748
(1987); Schall v. Martin, 467 U. S. 253, 270 (1984).

Second, if Foucha can no longer be held as an insanity acquittee in a mental hospital, he is entitled to constitutionally
adequate procedures to establish the grounds for his confinement. Jackson v. Indiana, supra, indicates as much.
There, a person under criminal charges was found incompetent to stand trial and was committed until he regained his
sanity. It was later determined that nothing could be done
to cure the detainee, who was a deaf mute. The state courts
refused to order his release. We reversed, holding that the
State was entitled to hold a person for being incompetent to
stand trial only long enough to determine if he could be
cured and become competent. If he was to be held longer,
the State was required to afford the protections constitutionally required in a civil commitment proceeding. We noted,
relying on Baxstrom v. Herold, 383 U. S. 107 (1966), that a
convicted criminal who allegedly was mentally ill was entitled to release at the end of his term unless the State committed him in a civil proceeding. " `[T]here is no conceivable
basis for distinguishing the commitment of a person who is
nearing the end of a penal term from all other civil commitments.' " Jackson v. Indiana, supra, at 724, quoting Baxstrom, supra, at 111-112.

clear that commitment for any purpose constitutes a signifi-cant deprivation of liberty that requires due process protection." Jones, supra, at 361 (internal quotation marks omitted). We have always been careful not to "minimize the
importance and fundamental nature" of the individual's right
to liberty. Salerno, supra, at 750.

A State, pursuant to its police power, may of course imprison convicted criminals for the purposes of deterrence and
retribution. But there are constitutional limitations on the
conduct that a State may criminalize. See, e. g., Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444 (1969); Robinson v. California,
370 U. S. 660 (1962). Here, the State has no such punitive
interest. As Foucha was not convicted, he may not be punished. Jones, supra, at 369. Here, Louisiana has by reason
of his acquittal exempted Foucha from criminal responsibility as La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 14:14 (West 1986) requires. See
n. 1, supra.

The State may also confine a mentally ill person if it shows
"by clear and convincing evidence that the individual is mentally ill and dangerous," Jones, 463 U. S., at 362. Here, the
State has not carried that burden; indeed, the State does not
claim that Foucha is now mentally ill.

We have also held that in certain narrow circumstances
persons who pose a danger to others or to the community
may be subject to limited confinement and it is on these
cases, particularly United States v. Salerno, supra, that the
State relies in this case.

Opinion of the Court
Salerno, unlike this case, involved pretrial detention. Weobserved in

Salerno that the "government's interest in preventing crime by arrestees is both legitimate and compel-ling,"

id., at 749, and that the statute involved there was a
constitutional implementation of that interest. The statute
carefully limited the circumstances under which detentioncould be sought to those involving the most serious of crimes

(crimes of violence, offenses punishable by life imprisonmentor death, serious drug offenses, or certain repeat offenders),
id., at 747, and was narrowly focused on a particularly acuteproblem in which the government interests are overwhelming, id., at 750. In addition to first demonstrating probable
cause, the Government was required, in a "full-blown adversary hearing," to convince a neutral decisionmaker by clear
and convincing evidence that no conditions of release can reasonably assure the safety of the community or any person,
i. e., that the "arrestee presents an identified and articulable
threat to an individual or the community." Id., at 751. Furthermore, the duration of confinement under the Bail Reform
Act of 1984 (Act) was strictly limited. The arrestee was
entitled to a prompt detention hearing and the maximum
length of pretrial detention was limited by the "stringent
time limitations of the Speedy Trial Act." Id., at 747. If
the arrestee were convicted, he would be confined as a criminal proved guilty; if he were acquitted, he would go free.
Moreover, the Act required that detainees be housed, to the
extent practicable, in a facility separate from persons awaiting or serving sentences or awaiting appeal. Id., at 747-748.

Salerno does not save Louisiana's detention of insanity acquittees who are no longer mentally ill. Unlike the sharply
focused scheme at issue in Salerno, the Louisiana scheme of
confinement is not carefully limited. Under the state statute, Foucha is not now entitled to an adversary hearing at
which the State must prove by clear and convincing evidence
that he is demonstrably dangerous to the community. Indeed, the State need prove nothing to justify continued de504US1$69D 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT
82 FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA

Opinion of the Court
tention, for the statute places the burden on the detainee toprove that he is not dangerous. At the hearing which ended

with Foucha's recommittal, no doctor or any other persontestified positively that in his opinion Foucha would be a danger to the community, let alone gave the basis for such an
opinion. There was only a description of Foucha's behaviorat Feliciana and his antisocial personality, along with a refusal to certify that he would not be dangerous. When di-rectly asked whether Foucha would be dangerous, Dr. Ritter
said only, "I don't think I would feel comfortable in certifyingthat he would not be a danger to himself or to other people."
App. 18. This, under the Louisiana statute, was enough to
defeat Foucha's interest in physical liberty. It is not enough
to defeat Foucha's liberty interest under the Constitution in
being freed from indefinite confinement in a mental facility.

Furthermore, if Foucha committed criminal acts while at
Feliciana, such as assault, the State does not explain why its
interest would not be vindicated by the ordinary criminal
processes involving charge and conviction, the use of enhanced sentences for recidivists, and other permissible ways
of dealing with patterns of criminal conduct. These are the
normal means of dealing with persistent criminal conduct.
Had they been employed against Foucha when he assaulted
other inmates, there is little doubt that if then sane he could
have been convicted and incarcerated in the usual way.

It was emphasized in Salerno that the detention we found
constitutionally permissible was strictly limited in duration.
481 U. S., at 747; see also Schall, 467 U. S., at 269. Here, in
contrast, the State asserts that because Foucha once committed a criminal act and now has an antisocial personality
that sometimes leads to aggressive conduct, a disorder for
which there is no effective treatment, he may be held indefinitely. This rationale would permit the State to hold indefinitely any other insanity acquittee not mentally ill who
could be shown to have a personality disorder that may lead
to criminal conduct. The same would be true of any con504US1$69D 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
victed criminal, even though he has completed his prisonterm. It would also be only a step away from substituting confinements for dangerousness for our present systemwhich, with only narrow exceptions and aside from permissible confinements for mental illness, incarcerates only thosewho are proved beyond reasonable doubt to have violated a
criminal law."In our society liberty is the norm, and detention prior
to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception."
United States v. Salerno, supra, at 755. The narrowly fo-cused pretrial detention of arrestees permitted by the Bail

Reform Act was found to be one of those carefully limitedexceptions permitted by the Due Process Clause. We decline to take a similar view of a law like Louisiana's, whichpermits the indefinite detention of insanity acquittees who
are not mentally ill but who do not prove they would not bedangerous to others.

6 Justice Thomas' dissent firmly embraces the view that the State may
indefinitely hold an insanity acquittee who is found by a court to have
been cured of his mental illness and who is unable to prove that he would
not be dangerous. This would be so even though, as in this case, the
court's finding of dangerousness is based solely on the detainee's antisocial
personality that apparently has caused him to engage in altercations from
time to time. Justice Thomas, however, does not challenge the holding
of our cases that a convicted criminal may not be held as a mentally ill
person without following the requirements for civil commitment, which
would not permit further detention based on dangerousness alone. Yet it
is surely strange to release sane but very likely dangerous persons who
have committed a crime knowing precisely what they were doing but continue to hold indefinitely an insanity detainee who committed a criminal
act at a time when, as found by a court, he did not know right from wrong.
Justice Thomas' rationale for continuing to hold the insanity acquittee
would surely justify treating the convicted felon in the same way, and if
put to it, it appears that he would permit it. But as indicated in the text,
this is not consistent with our present system of justice.

Justice Thomas relies heavily on the American Law Institute's (ALI)
Model Penal Code and Commentary. However, his reliance on the Model
Code is misplaced and his quotation from the Commentary is importantly
incomplete. Justice Thomas argues that the Louisiana statute follows

84 FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA

Opinion of White, J.

III
It should be apparent from what has been said earlier inthis opinion that the Louisiana statute also discriminates

"the current provisions" of the Model Penal Code, but he fails to mention
that $ 4.08 is "current" only in the sense that the Model Code has not been
amended since its approval in 1962, and therefore fails to incorporate or
reflect substantial developments in the relevant decisional law during the
intervening three decades. Thus, although this is nowhere noted in the
dissent, the Explanatory Notes expressly concede that related and similarly "current" provisions of Article 4 are unconstitutional. See, e. g.,
ALI, Model Penal Code $ 4.06(2), Explanatory Note (1985) (noting that

$ 4.06(2), permitting indefinite commitment of a mentally incompetent defendant without the finding required for civil commitment, is unconstitutional in light of Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U. S. 715 (1972), and other decisions of this Court). Nor indeed does Justice Thomas advert to the 1985
Explanatory Note to $ 4.08 itself, even though that note directly questions
the constitutionality of the provision that he so heavily relies on; it acknowledges, as Justice Thomas does not, that "it is now questionable
whether a state may use the single criterion of dangerousness to grant
discharge if it employs a different standard for release of persons civilly
committed." Justice Thomas also recites from the Commentary regarding $ 4.08. However, the introductory passage that Justice Thomas
quotes prefaces a more important passage that he omits. After explaining the rationale for the questionable provision, the Commentary states:
"Constitutional doubts . . . exist about the criterion of dangerousness. If
a person committed civilly must be released when he is no longer suffering
mental illness, it is questionable whether a person acquitted on grounds
of mental disease or defect excluding responsibility can be kept in custody
solely on the ground that he continues to be dangerous." Id., $ 4.08, Comment 3, p. 260. Thus, while Justice Thomas argues that the Louisiana
statute is not a relic of a bygone age, his principal support for this assertion is a 30-year-old provision of the Model Penal Code whose constitutionality has since been openly questioned by the ALI reporters themselves.

Similarly unpersuasive is Justice Thomas' claim regarding the number
of States that allow confinement based on dangerousness alone. First,
this assertion carries with it an obvious but unacknowledged corollary--
the vast majority of States do not allow confinement based on dangerousness alone. Second, Justice Thomas' description of these state statutes
also is importantly incomplete. Even as he argues that a scheme of confinement based on dangerousness alone is not a relic of a bygone age,
Justice Thomas neglects to mention that two of the statutes he relies

Opinion of White, J.
against Foucha in violation of the Equal Protection Clauseof the Fourteenth Amendment.

Jones established that insanity acquittees may be treated differently in some respectsfrom those persons subject to civil commitment, but Foucha,

who is not now thought to be insane, can no longer be so
classified. The State nonetheless insists on holding him in-definitely because he at one time committed a criminal act

and does not now prove he is not dangerous. Louisiana law,however, does not provide for similar confinement for other
classes of persons who have committed criminal acts and whocannot later prove they would not be dangerous. Criminals
who have completed their prison terms, or are about to doso, are an obvious and large category of such persons. Many
of them will likely suffer from the same sort of personality
disorder that Foucha exhibits. However, state law does notallow for their continuing confinement based merely on dangerousness. Instead, the State controls the behavior of
these similarly situated citizens by relying on other means,
such as punishment, deterrence, and supervised release.

on have been amended, as Justice O'Connor notes. Nor does Justice
Thomas acknowledge that at least two of the other statutes he lists as
permitting confinement based on dangerousness alone have been given a
contrary construction by highest state courts, which have found that the
interpretation for which Justice Thomas cites them would be impermissible. See State v. Fields, 77 N. J. 282, 390 A. 2d 574 (1978); In re Lewis,
403 A. 2d 1115, 1121 (Del. 1979), quoting Mills v. State, 256 A. 2d 752, 757,

n. 4 (Del. 1969) ("By necessary implication, the danger referred to must
be construed to relate to mental illness for the reason that dangerousness
without mental illness could not be a valid basis for indeterminate confinement in the State hospital"). See also ALI, Model Penal Code, supra,
at 260 (although provisions may on their face allow for confinement based
on dangerousness alone, in virtually all actual cases the questions of dangerousness and continued mental disease are likely to be closely linked).
As the widespread rejection of the standard for confinement that Justice
Thomas and Justice Kennedy argue for demonstrates, States are able
to protect both the safety of the public and the rights of the accused without challenging foundational principles of American criminal justice and
constitutional law.

86 FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Freedom from physical restraint being a fundamental right,the State must have a particularly convincing reason, which

it has not put forward, for such discrimination against insan-ity acquittees who are no longer mentally ill.

Furthermore, in civil commitment proceedings the State
must establish the grounds of insanity and dangerousnesspermitting confinement by clear and convincing evidence.

Addington, 441 U. S., at 425-433. Similarly, the State mustestablish insanity and dangerousness by clear and convincing
evidence in order to confine an insane convict beyond hiscriminal sentence, when the basis for his original confinement no longer exists. See Jackson, 406 U. S., at 724; Baxstrom, 383 U. S., at 111-112. Cf. Humphrey v. Cady, 405
U. S. 504, 510-511 (1972). However, the State now claims
that it may continue to confine Foucha, who is not now considered to be mentally ill, solely because he is deemed dangerous, but without assuming the burden of proving even
this ground for confinement by clear and convincing evidence. The court below gave no convincing reason why
the procedural safeguards against unwarranted confinement
which are guaranteed to insane persons and those who have
been convicted may be denied to a sane acquittee, and the
State has done no better in this Court.

For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the Louisiana
Supreme Court is reversed.

So ordered.

Justice O'Connor, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.

Louisiana asserts that it may indefinitely confine Terry
Foucha in a mental facility because, although not mentally
ill, he might be dangerous to himself or to others if released.
For the reasons given in Part II of the Court's opinion, this
contention should be rejected. I write separately, however,
to emphasize that the Court's opinion addresses only the specific statutory scheme before us, which broadly permits in504US1$69J 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT

87Cite as: 504 U. S. 71 (1992)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
definite confinement of sane insanity acquittees in psychiat-ric facilities. This case does not require us to pass judgment

on more narrowly drawn laws that provide for detention ofinsanity acquittees, or on statutes that provide for punishment of persons who commit crimes while mentally ill.

I do not understand the Court to hold that Louisiana maynever confine dangerous insanity acquittees after they regain

mental health. Under Louisiana law, defendants who carrythe burden of proving insanity by a preponderance of the
evidence will "escape punishment," but this affirmative de-fense becomes relevant only after the prosecution establishes
beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed
criminal acts with the required level of criminal intent.
State v. Marmillion, 339 So. 2d 788, 796 (La. 1976). Although insanity acquittees may not be incarcerated as criminals or penalized for asserting the insanity defense, see
Jones v. United States, 463 U. S. 354, 368-369, and n. 18
(1983), this finding of criminal conduct sets them apart from
ordinary citizens.

We noted in Jones that a judicial determination of criminal
conduct provides "concrete evidence" of dangerousness. Id.,
at 364. By contrast, " `[t]he only certain thing that can be
said about the present state of knowledge and therapy regarding mental disease is that science has not reached finality of judgment . . . .' " Id., at 365, n. 13 (quoting Greenwood
v. United States, 350 U. S. 366, 375 (1956)). Given this uncertainty, "courts should pay particular deference to reasonable legislative judgments" about the relationship between
dangerous behavior and mental illness. Jones, supra, at
365, n. 13. Louisiana evidently has determined that the inference of dangerousness drawn from a verdict of not guilty
by reason of insanity continues even after a clinical finding
of sanity, and that judgment merits judicial deference.

It might therefore be permissible for Louisiana to confine
an insanity acquittee who has regained sanity if, unlike the
situation in this case, the nature and duration of detention

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
were tailored to reflect pressing public safety concernsrelated to the acquittee's continuing dangerousness. See

United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 747-751 (1987);
Schall v. Martin, 467 U. S. 253, 264-271 (1984); Jackson v.
Indiana, 406 U. S. 715, 738 (1972). Although the dissenters
apparently disagree, see post, at 100 (opinion of Kennedy,
J.); post, at 125 (opinion of Thomas, J.), I think it clear that
acquittees could not be confined as mental patients absentsome medical justification for doing so; in such a case the

necessary connection between the nature and purposes ofconfinement would be absent. See

Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S.
480, 491-494 (1980) (discussing infringements upon liberty
unique to commitment to a mental hospital); Jones, supra, at
384-385 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (same). Nor would it be
permissible to treat all acquittees alike, without regard for
their particular crimes. For example, the strong interest in
liberty of a person acquitted by reason of insanity but later
found sane might well outweigh the governmental interest
in detention where the only evidence of dangerousness is
that the acquittee committed a nonviolent or relatively minor
crime. Cf. Salerno, supra, at 750 (interest in pretrial detention is "overwhelming" where only individuals arrested for
"a specific category of extremely serious offenses" are detained and "Congress specifically found that these individuals are far more likely to be responsible for dangerous acts
in the community after arrest"). Equal protection principles may set additional limits on the confinement of sane but
dangerous acquittees. Although I think it unnecessary to
reach equal protection issues on the facts before us, the permissibility of holding an acquittee who is not mentally ill
longer than a person convicted of the same crimes could be
imprisoned is open to serious question.

The second point to be made about the Court's holding is
that it places no new restriction on the States' freedom to
determine whether, and to what extent, mental illness
should excuse criminal behavior. The Court does not indi504US1$69J 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT

89Cite as: 504 U. S. 71 (1992)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
cate that States must make the insanity defense available.See Idaho Code $ 18-207(a) (1987) (mental condition not a

defense to criminal charges); Mont. Code Ann. $ 46-14-102(1991) (evidence of mental illness admissible to prove absence
of state of mind that is an element of the offense). It likewise casts no doubt on laws providing for prison terms afterverdicts of "guilty but mentally ill." See,

e. g., Del. Code
Ann., Tit. 11, $ 408(b) (1987); Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, || 1005-2-6(1989); Ind. Code $ 35-36-2-5 (Supp. 1991). If a State concludes that mental illness is best considered in the contextof criminal sentencing, the holding of this case erects no bar
to implementing that judgment.

Finally, it should be noted that the great majority of
States have adopted policies consistent with the Court's
holding. Justice Thomas claims that 11 States have laws
comparable to Louisiana's, see post, at 112-113, n. 9, but even
this number overstates the case. Two of the States Justice
Thomas mentions have already amended their laws to provide for the release of acquittees who do not suffer from mental illness but may be dangerous. See Cal. Penal Code Ann.

$ 1026.2 (West Supp. 1992) (effective Jan. 1, 1994); Va. Code
Ann. $ 19.2-182.5 (Supp. 1991) (effective July 1, 1992).
Three others limit the maximum duration of criminal commitment to reflect the acquittee's specific crimes and hold
acquittees in facilities appropriate to their mental condition.
See N. J. Stat. Ann. $$ 2C:4-8(b)(3) (West 1982), 30:4-24.2
(West 1981); Wash. Rev. Code $$ 10.77.020(3), 10.77.110(1)
(1990); Wis. Stat. $$ 971.17(1), (3)(c) (Supp. 1991). I do not
understand the Court's opinion to render such laws necessarily invalid.

Of the remaining six States, two do not condition commitment upon proof of every element of a crime. Kan. Stat.
Ann. $ 22-3428(1) (Supp. 1990) ("A finding of not guilty by
reason of insanity shall constitute a finding that the acquitted
person committed an act constituting the offense charged
. . . , except that the person did not possess the requisite

90 FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA

Kennedy, J., dissenting
criminal intent"); Mont. Code Ann. $ 46-14-301(1) (1991)(allowing commitment of persons "found not guilty for the

reason that due to a mental disease or defect the defendantcould not have a particular state of mind that is an essential
element of the offense charged"). Such laws might well fail
even under the dissenters' theories. See post, at 91-94 (Kennedy, J., dissenting); post, at 103 (Thomas, J., dissenting).

Today's holding follows directly from our precedents andleaves the States appropriate latitude to care for insanity

acquittees in a way consistent with public welfare. Accord-ingly, I concur in Parts I and II of the Court's opinion and
in the judgment of the Court.

Justice Kennedy, with whom The Chief Justice
joins, dissenting.

As incarceration of persons is the most common and one
of the most feared instruments of state oppression and state
indifference, we ought to acknowledge at the outset that
freedom from this restraint is essential to the basic definition
of liberty in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the
Constitution. I agree with the Court's reaffirmation of this
first premise. But I submit with all respect that the majority errs in its failure to recognize that the conditions for incarceration imposed by the State in this case are in accord
with legitimate and traditional state interests, vindicated
after full and fair procedures. The error results from the
majority's primary reliance on cases, such as O'Connor v.
Donaldson, 422 U. S. 563 (1975), and Addington v. Texas,
441 U. S. 418 (1979), which define the due process limits for
involuntary civil commitment. The majority relies on these
civil cases while overruling without mention one of the holdings of our most recent and significant precedent from the
criminal context, Jones v. United States, 463 U. S. 354 (1983).

This is a criminal case. It began one day when petitioner,
brandishing a .357 revolver, entered the home of a married
couple, intending to steal. Brief for Respondent 1. He

Kennedy, J., dissenting
chased them out of their home and fired on police officerswho confronted him as he fled. Id., at 1-2. Petitioner was

apprehended and charged with aggravated burglary and theillegal use of a weapon in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann.

$$ 14:60 and 14:94 (West 1986). 563 So. 2d 1138, 1138-1139(La. 1990). There is no question that petitioner committed
the criminal acts charged. Petitioner's response was todeny criminal responsibility based on his mental illness when
he committed the acts. He contended his mental illness pre-vented him from distinguishing between right and wrong
with regard to the conduct in question.Mental illness may bear upon criminal responsibility, as a
general rule, in either of two ways: First, it may precludethe formation of mens rea, if the disturbance is so profound
that it prevents the defendant from forming the requisiteintent as defined by state law; second, it may support an
affirmative plea of legal insanity. See W. LaFave & A.Scott, Jr., 1 Substantive Criminal Law $ 4.1(b), pp. 429-430
(1986) (hereinafter LaFave & Scott). Depending on thecontent of state law, the first possibility may implicate the
State's initial burden, under In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358,364 (1970), to prove every element of the offense beyond a
reasonable doubt, while the second possibility does not.
Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 206 (1977); Lelandv. Oregon, 343 U. S. 790, 795-796 (1952).

The power of the States to determine the existence ofcriminal insanity following the establishment of the underlying offense is well established. In Leland v. Oregon, we up-held a state law that required the defendant to prove insanity beyond a reasonable doubt, observing that this burdenhad no effect on the State's initial burden to prove every
element of the underlying criminal offense.

"[T]he burden of proof of guilt, and of all the necessaryelements of guilt, was placed squarely upon the State.

As the jury was told, this burden did not shift, butrested upon the State throughout the trial, just as, ac504US1$69L 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT
92 FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA

Kennedy, J., dissenting
cording to the instructions, appellant was presumed tobe innocent until the jury was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty. The jurors were toconsider separately the issue of legal sanity

per se--an
issue set apart from the crime charged, to be introduced
by a special plea and decided by a special verdict." Id.,at 795-796 (footnotes omitted).

As then-Justice Rehnquist explained the reasoning of Leland, "the existence or nonexistence of legal insanity bearsno necessary relationship to the existence or nonexistence of

the required mental elements of the crime." Mullaney v.
Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 706 (1975) (concurring opinion); seealso

Patterson v. New York, supra, at 206 (defense of insanity
considered only after the facts constituting the crime havebeen proved beyond a reasonable doubt);

Rivera v. Delaware, 429 U. S. 877 (1976) (dismissing challenge to a Lelandinstruction for want of a substantial federal question).

Louisiana law follows the pattern in Leland with clarityand precision. Pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art.
552 (West 1981), the petitioner entered a dual plea of not
guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. The dual plea,which the majority does not discuss or even mention, ensures

that the Winship burden remains on the State to prove allthe elements of the crime. The Louisiana Supreme Court
confirms this in a recent case approving the following juryinstruction on the defense of insanity:

" `In this case the accused has entered a dual plea ofnot guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. As a
consequence of such a plea, you must first determine
whether or not the accused committed a crime [on which
you have been instructed]. If you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did commit
any of these crimes, any one of these crimes, then you
must proceed to a determination of whether he was sane
at the time the crime was committed and thereby crimi504US1$69L 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT

nally responsible for committing it.' " State v. Marmil-lion, 339 So. 2d 788, 796 (1976).

The State's burden is unaffected by an adjudication withouttrial, such as occurred here, because state law requires
the trial court to determine, before accepting the plea, thatthere is a factual basis for it. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.,
Art. 558.1 (West Supp. 1992). There is no dispute that thetrial court complied with state law and made the requisite
findings.Compliance with the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is the defining, central feature in criminal adjudi-cation, unique to the criminal law.

Addington, 441 U. S., at428. Its effect is at once both symbolic and practical, as a

statement of values about respect and confidence in the crim-inal law, Winship, 397 U. S., at 364, and an apportionment

of risk in favor of the accused, id., at 369-372 (Harlan, J.,concurring). We have often subjected to heightened due
process scrutiny, with regard to both purpose and duration,deprivations of physical liberty imposed before a judgment
is rendered under this standard. See, e. g., United States v.
Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 750-751 (1987); Jackson v. Indiana,406 U. S. 715, 738 (1972); cf. Jones v. United States, 463 U. S.,

at 363-364, and n. 12 ("The proof beyond a reasonable doubtthat the acquittee committed a criminal act distinguishes this
case from Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U. S. 715 (1972) . . . . In
Jackson there never was any affirmative proof that the ac-cused had committed criminal acts . . ."). The same heightened due process scrutiny does not obtain, though, once theState has met its burden of proof and obtained an adjudication. It is well settled that upon compliance with In re
Winship, the State may incarcerate on any reasonable basis.Chapman v. United States, 500 U. S. 453, 465 (1991); Williams v. Illinois, 399 U. S. 235, 243 (1970).As

Justice Thomas observes in his dissent, the majorityerrs by attaching "talismanic significance" to the fact that

petitioner has been adjudicated "not guilty by reason of in504US1$69L 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT

sanity." Post, at 118, n. 13. A verdict of not guilty by reasonof insanity is neither equivalent nor comparable to a verdict

of not guilty standing alone. We would not allow a State toevade its burden of proof by replacing its criminal law with
a civil system in which there is no presumption of innocence
and the defendant has the burden of proof. Nor should weentertain the proposition that this case differs from a conviction of guilty because petitioner has been adjudged "notguilty by reason of insanity," rather than "guilty but insane."
Petitioner has suggested no grounds on which to distinguishthe liberty interests involved or procedural protections afforded as a consequence of the State's ultimate choice of nomenclature. The due process implications ought not to vary
under these circumstances. This is a criminal case in which
the State has complied with the rigorous demands of In re
Winship.

The majority's failure to recognize the criminal character
of these proceedings and its concomitant standards of proof
leads it to conflate the standards for civil and criminal commitment in a manner not permitted by our precedents.
O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U. S. 563 (1975), and Addington
v. Texas, supra, define the due process limits of involuntary
civil commitment. Together they stand for the proposition
that in civil proceedings the Due Process Clause requires the
State to prove both insanity and dangerousness by clear and
convincing evidence. See O'Connor, supra, at 575; Addington, supra, at 433. Their precedential value in the civil context is beyond question. But it is an error to apply these
precedents, as the majority does today, to criminal proceedings. By treating this criminal case as a civil one, the majority overrules a principal holding in Jones v. United States,
463 U. S., at 354.

In Jones we considered the system of criminal commitment enacted by Congress for the District of Columbia. Id.,
at 356-358. Congress provided for acquittal by reason of
insanity only after the Government had shown, beyond a rea504US1$69L 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT

Kennedy, J., dissenting
sonable doubt, that the defendant had committed the crimescharged.

Id., at 363-364, and n. 12. In cases of acquittal
by reason of insanity, District law provided for automaticcommitment followed by periodic hearings, where the insanity acquittee was given the opportunity to prove that he was
no longer insane or dangerous. Id., at 357-358, and n. 3.Petitioner in

Jones contended that Addington and O'Connor
applied to criminal proceedings as well as civil, requiring theGovernment to prove insanity and dangerousness by clear

and convincing evidence before commitment. We rejectedthat contention. In

Jones we distinguished criminal from
civil commitment, holding that the Due Process Clause permits automatic incarceration after a criminal adjudication
and without further process. Id., at 366. The majority
today in effect overrules that holding. It holds that "keeping Foucha against his will in a mental institution is improper absent a determination in civil commitment proceedings of current mental illness and dangerousness." Ante, at
78; see also ante, at 80, 85-86. Our holding in Jones was
clear and to the contrary. We should not so disregard controlling precedent.

Our respect for the Court's opinion in Jones should be informed by the recognition that its distinction between civil
and criminal commitment is both sound and consistent with
long-established precedent. First, as described above, the
procedural protections afforded in a criminal commitment
surpass those in a civil commitment; indeed, these procedural
protections are the most stringent known to our law. Second, proof of criminal conduct in accordance with In re
Winship eliminates the risk of incarceration "for mere `idiosyncratic behavior,' [because a] criminal act by definition is
not `within a range of conduct that is generally acceptable.' "
Jones, supra, at 367, quoting Addington, supra, at 426-427.
The criminal law defines a discrete category of conduct for
which society has reserved its greatest opprobrium and
strictest sanctions; past or future dangerousness, as ascer504US1$69L 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT

tained or predicted in civil proceedings, is different in kind.Third, the State presents distinct rationales for these differing forms of commitment: In the civil context, the State actsin large part on the basis of its parens patriae power to
protect and provide for an ill individual, while in the criminalcontext, the State acts to ensure the public safety. See

Add-ington, 441 U. S., at 426; S. Brakel, J. Parry, & B. Weiner,

The Mentally Disabled and the Law 24-25 (3d ed. 1985). Adismissive footnote, see ante, at 76-77, n. 4, cannot overcome
these fundamental defects in the majority's opinion.The majority's opinion is troubling at a further level, because it fails to recognize or account for profound differencesbetween clinical insanity and state-law definitions of criminal
insanity. It is by now well established that insanity as de-fined by the criminal law has no direct analog in medicine or
science. "[T]he divergence between law and psychiatry iscaused in part by the legal fiction represented by the words
`insanity' or `insane,' which are a kind of lawyer's catchalland have no clinical meaning." J. Biggs, The Guilty Mind
117 (1955); see also 2 J. Bouvier, Law Dictionary 1590 (8thed. 1914) ("The legal and the medical ideas of insanity are
essentially different, and the difference is one of substance").Consistent with the general rule that the definition of both
crimes and defenses is a matter of state law, see Pattersonv. New York, 432 U. S., at 210, the States are free to recognize and define the insanity defense as they see fit.

"Nothing could be less fruitful than for this Court tobe impelled into defining some sort of insanity test in

constitutional terms. . . . It is simply not yet the time towrite into the Constitution formulas cast in terms whose
meaning, let alone relevance, is not yet clear either todoctors or to lawyers." Powell v. Texas, 392 U. S. 514,

536-537 (1968) (plurality opinion).
See also id., at 545 (the Constitution does not impose on theStates any particular test of criminal responsibility) (Black,

J., concurring).

As provided by Louisiana law, and consistent with bothfederal criminal law and the law of a majority of the States,

petitioner was found not guilty by reason of insanity underthe traditional

M'Naghten test. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann.

$ 14:14 (West 1986); 18 U. S. C. $ 17; M'Naghten's Case, 10
Cl. & Fin. 200, 8 Eng. Rep. 718 (1843); 1 LaFave & Scott$ 4.2, at 436. Louisiana law provides a traditional statement

of this test: "If the circumstances indicate that because of amental disease or mental defect the offender was incapable
of distinguishing between right and wrong with reference tothe conduct in question, the offender shall be exempt from
criminal responsibility." La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 14:14 (West
1986).

Because the M'Naghten test for insanity turns on a finding
of criminal irresponsibility at the time of the offense, it is
quite wrong to place reliance on the fact, as the majority
does, that Louisiana does not contend that petitioner is now
insane. See ante, at 78. This circumstance should come as
no surprise, since petitioner was competent at the time of his
plea, 563 So. 2d, at 1139, and indeed could not have entered a
plea otherwise, see Drope v. Missouri, 420 U. S. 162, 171
(1975). Present sanity would have relevance if petitioner
had been committed as a consequence of civil proceedings, in
which dangerous conduct in the past was used to predict similar conduct in the future. It has no relevance here, however. Petitioner has not been confined based on predictions
about future behavior but rather for past criminal conduct.
Unlike civil commitment proceedings, which attempt to divine the future from the past, in a criminal trial whose outcome turns on M'Naghten, findings of past insanity and past
criminal conduct possess intrinsic and ultimate significance.

The system here described is not employed in all jurisdictions. Some have supplemented the traditional M'Naghten
test with the so-called "irresistible impulse" test, see 1 LaFave & Scott $ 4.1, at 427-428; others have adopted a test
proposed as part of the Model Penal Code, see ibid.; and still

504US1$69L 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT

Kennedy, J., dissenting
others have abolished the defense altogether, see Idaho Code$ 18-207(a) (1987); Mont. Code Ann. $ 46-14-102 (1992).

Since it is well accepted that the States may define their owncrimes and defenses, see

supra, at 96, the point would not
warrant further mention, but for the fact that the majority
loses sight of it. In describing our decision in Jones, themajority relies on our statement that a verdict of not guilty

by reason of insanity establishes that the defendant " `com-mitted the act because of mental illness.' "

Ante, at 76,
quoting Jones, 463 U. S., at 363. That was an accurate state-ment in

Jones but not here. The defendant in Jones was
acquitted under the Durham test for insanity, which excludes from punishment criminal conduct that is the product
of a mental disease or defect. See Bethea v. United States,
365 A. 2d 64, 69, n. 11 (1976); see also Durham v. United
States, 94 U. S. App. D. C. 228, 240-241, 214 F. 2d 862, 874-
875 (1954). In a Durham jurisdiction, it would be fair to
say, as the Court did in Jones, that a defendant acquitted
by reason of insanity "committed the act because of mental
illness." Jones, supra, at 363. The same cannot be said
here, where insanity under M'Naghten proves only that the
defendant could not have distinguished between right and
wrong. It is no small irony that the aspect of Jones on
which the majority places greatest reliance, and indeed cites
as an example of its adherence to Jones, has no bearing on
the Louisiana statute at issue here. See ante, at 76, and
n. 4.

The establishment of a criminal act and of insanity under
the M'Naghten regime provides a legitimate basis for confinement. Although Louisiana has chosen not to punish insanity acquittees, the State has not surrendered its interest
in incapacitative incarceration. The Constitution does not
require any particular model for criminal confinement, Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 999 (1991) (Kennedy, J.,
concurring in judgment) ("The federal and state criminal
systems have accorded different weights at different times

to the penological goals of retribution, deterrence, incapaci-tation, and rehabilitation");

Williams v. New York, 337 U. S.
241, 246 (1949), and upon compliance with In re Winship, theState may incarcerate on any reasonable basis, see

supra,
at 93. Incapacitation for the protection of society is not an
unusual ground for incarceration. "[I]solation of the dan-gerous has always been considered an important function of

the criminal law," Powell v. Texas, 392 U. S. 514, 539 (1968)(Black, J., concurring), and insanity acquittees are a special
class of offenders proved dangerous beyond their own abilityto comprehend. The wisdom of incarceration under these
circumstances is demonstrated by its high level of acceptance. Every State provides for discretionary or mandatory
incarceration of insanity acquittees, 1 LaFave & Scott

$ 4.6(a), at 510, and as Justice Thomas observes in his dissent, provisions like those in Louisiana, predicated on dangerousness alone, have been endorsed by the Model Penal
Code and adopted by the legislatures of no fewer than 11
other States. See post, at 111-112, and nn. 8 and 9.

It remains to be seen whether the majority, by questioning
the legitimacy of incapacitative incarceration, puts in doubt
the confinement of persons other than insanity acquittees.
Parole release provisions often place the burden of proof on
the prisoner to prove his lack of dangerousness. To use a
familiar example, under the federal parole system in place
until the enactment of the Sentencing Guidelines, an inmate
could not be released on parole unless he established that
his "release would not jeopardize the public welfare." 18
U. S. C. $ 4206(a)(2) (1982 ed.), repealed 98 Stat. 2027; see also
28 CFR $ 2.18 (1991). This requirement reflected "the incapacitative aspect of the use of imprisonment which has the
effect of denying the opportunity for future criminality, at
least for a time." U. S. Dept. of Justice, United States Parole Commission Rules and Procedures Manual 69 (July 24,
1989). This purpose is consistent with the parole release
provisions of Alabama, Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts,

Kennedy, J., dissenting
Michigan, New York, and the District of Columbia, to name
just a few. See N. Cohen & J. Gobert, Law of Probation and
Parole $ 3.05, p. 109, and n. 103 (1983). It is difficult for me
to reconcile the rationale of incapacitative incarceration,
which underlies these regimes, with the opinion of the majority, which discounts its legitimacy.

I also have difficulty with the majority's emphasis on the
conditions of petitioner's confinement. In line with Justice
O'Connor's concurring opinion, see ante, at 87-88, the majority emphasizes the fact that petitioner has been confined in a
mental institution, see ante, at 77-78, 78-79, 82, suggesting
that his incarceration might not be unconstitutional if undertaken elsewhere. The majority offers no authority for its
suggestion, while Justice O'Connor relies on a reading of
Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S. 480 (1980), which was rejected by the
Court in Jones v. United States. See ante, at 87-88, citing
Jones v. United States, supra, at 384-385 (Brennan, J., dissenting). The petitioner did not rely on this argument at any
point in the proceedings, and we have not the authority to
make the assumption, as a matter of law, that the conditions of
petitioner's confinement are in any way infirm. Ours is not
a case, as in Vitek v. Jones, where the State has stigmatized
petitioner by placing him in a mental institution when he
should have been placed elsewhere. Jones v. United States
is explicit on this point: "A criminal defendant who successfully raises the insanity defense necessarily is stigmatized
by the verdict itself, and thus the commitment causes little
additional harm in this respect." 463 U. S., at 367, n. 16.
Nor is this a case, as in Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210
(1990), in which petitioner has suffered some further deprivation of liberty to which independent due process protections might attach. Both the fact and conditions of confinement here are attributable to petitioner's criminal
conduct and subsequent decision to plead insanity. To the
extent the majority relies on the conditions of petitioner's

confinement, its decision is without authority, and most of itsopinion is nothing more than confusing dicta.

I submit that today's decision is unwarranted and unwise.I share the Court's concerns about the risks inherent in requiring a committed person to prove what can often be imprecise, but as Justice Thomas observes in his dissent, thisis not a case in which the period of confinement exceeds the

gravity of the offense or in which there are reasons to believethe release proceedings are pointless or a sham.

Post, at
114, n. 10. Petitioner has been incarcerated for less thanone-third the statutory maximum for the offenses proved by

the State. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $$ 14:60 (aggravated burglary) and 14:94 (illegal use of a weapon) (West 1986). In
light of these facts, the majority's repeated reference to "indefinite detention," with apparent reference to the potential
duration of confinement, and not its lack of a fixed end point,
has no bearing on this case. See ante, at 77, n. 4, 82, 83,
n. 6; cf. ante, at 77, n. 4 (curious suggestion that confinement
has been extended beyond an initial term of years). It is
also significant to observe that this is not a case in which the
incarcerated subject has demonstrated his nondangerousness. Within the two months before his release hearing,
petitioner had been sent to a maximum security section of
the Feliciana Forensic Facility because of altercations with
another patient. 563 So. 2d, at 1141. Further, there is evidence in the record which suggests that petitioner's initial
claim of insanity may have been feigned. The medical panel
that reviewed petitioner's request for release stated that
"there is no evidence of mental illness," and indeed that
there was "never any evidence of mental illness or disease
since admission." App. 10. In sum, it would be difficult to
conceive of a less compelling situation for the imposition of
sweeping new constitutional commands such as the majority
imposes today.

Because the majority conflates the standards for civil and
criminal commitment, treating this criminal case as though

it were civil, it upsets a careful balance relied upon by theStates, not only in determining the conditions for continuing

confinement, but also in defining the defenses permitted for
mental incapacity at the time of the crime in question. In
my view, having adopted a traditional and well-accepted test
for determining criminal insanity, and having complied with
the rigorous demands of In re Winship, the State possesses
the constitutional authority to incarcerate petitioner for the
protection of society. I submit my respectful dissent.

Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Scalia join, dissenting.

The Louisiana statutory scheme the Court strikes down
today is not some quirky relic of a bygone age, but a codification of the current provisions of the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code. Invalidating this quite reasonable
scheme is bad enough; even worse is the Court's failure to
explain precisely what is wrong with it. In parts of its opinion, the Court suggests that the scheme is unconstitutional
because it provides for the continued confinement of insanity
acquittees who, although still dangerous, have "recovered"
their sanity. Ante, at 77 ("[T]he committed acquittee is
entitled to release when he has recovered his sanity or is no
longer dangerous") (emphasis added; internal quotation
marks omitted). In other parts of the opinion, the Court
suggests--and the concurrence states explicitly--that the
constitutional flaw with this scheme is not that it provides
for the confinement of sane insanity acquittees, but that it
(allegedly) provides for their "indefinite" confinement in a
mental facility. Ante, at 82; ante, at 86-87 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Nothing
in the Constitution, this Court's precedents, or our society's
traditions authorizes the Court to invalidate the Louisiana
scheme on either of these grounds. I would therefore affirm
the judgment of the Louisiana Supreme Court.

Thomas, J., dissenting

I
The Court errs, in large part, because it fails to examine
in detail the challenged statutory scheme and its application
in this case. Under Louisiana law, a verdict of "not guilty
by reason of insanity" differs significantly from a verdict of
"not guilty." A simple verdict of not guilty following a trial
means that the State has failed to prove all of the elements
of the charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e. g.,
State v. Messiah, 538 So. 2d 175, 180 (La. 1988) (citing In re
Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970)); cf. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.,
Art. 804(A)(1) (West 1969). A verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, in contrast, means that the defendant committed the crime, but established that he was "incapable of
distinguishing between right and wrong" with respect to his
criminal conduct. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 14:14 (West 1986).
Insanity, in other words, is an affirmative defense that does
not negate the State's proof, but merely "exempt[s the defendant] from criminal responsibility." Ibid. As the Louisiana Supreme Court has summarized: "The State's traditional burden of proof is to establish beyond a reasonable
doubt all necessary elements of the offense. Once this rigorous burden of proof has been met, it having been shown
that defendant has committed a crime, the defendant . . .
bear[s] the burden of establishing his defense of insanity

in order to escape punishment." State v. Marmillion, 339
So. 2d 788, 796 (1976) (emphasis added). See also State v.
Surrency, 88 So. 240, 244 (La. 1921).

Louisiana law provides a procedure for a judge to render
a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity upon a plea without a trial. See La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 558.1 (West
Supp. 1991). The trial court apparently relied on this procedure when it committed Foucha. See 563 So. 2d 1138, 1139,

104 FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA

Thomas, J., dissenting
n. 3 (La. 1990).1 After ordering two experts to examineFoucha, the trial court issued the following judgment:

"After considering the law and the evidence adduced
in this matter, the Court finds that the accused, Terry
Foucha, is unable to appreciate the usual, natural and
probable consequences of his acts; that he is unable to
distinguish right from wrong; that he is a menace to
himself and to others; and that he was insane at the time
of the commission of the above crimes and that he is
presently insane." App. 6.

After adjudicating a defendant not guilty by reason of
insanity, a trial court must hold a hearing on the issue of
dangerousness. The law specifies that "[i]f the court determines that the defendant cannot be released without a
danger to others or to himself, it shall order him committed
to . . . [a] mental institution." La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.,
Art. 654 (West Supp. 1991).2 " `Dangerous to others' means

1 Under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 558.1 (West Supp. 1991), a criminal defendant apparently concedes that he committed the crime, and advances his insanity as the sole ground on which to avoid conviction. Foucha does not challenge the procedures whereby he was adjudicated not
guilty by reason of insanity; nor does he deny that he committed the
crimes with which he was charged.

2 Article 654 provides in pertinent part:

"When a defendant is found not guilty by reason of insanity in any [noncapital] felony case, the court shall remand him to the parish jail or to a
private mental institution approved by the court and shall promptly hold
a contradictory hearing at which the defendant shall have the burden of
proof, to determine whether the defendant can be discharged or can be
released on probation, without danger to others or to himself. If the court
determines that the defendant cannot be released without danger to others or to himself, it shall order him committed to a proper state mental
institution or to a private mental institution approved by the court for
custody, care, and treatment. If the court determines that the defendant
can be discharged or released on probation without danger to others or to
himself, the court shall either order his discharge, or order his release on
probation subject to specified conditions for a fixed or an indeterminate
period. The court shall assign written findings of fact and conclusions of

the condition of a person whose behavior or significantthreats support a reasonable expectation that there is a substantial risk that he will inflict physical harm upon anotherperson in the near future." La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 28:2(3)
(West 1986) (emphasis added). " `Dangerous to self ' meansthe condition of a person whose behavior, significant threats
or inaction supports a reasonable expectation that there is asubstantial risk that he will inflict physical or severe emotional harm upon his own person." $ 28:2(4).After holding the requisite hearings, the trial court in this
case ordered Foucha committed to the Feliciana ForensicFacility. After his commitment, Foucha was entitled, upon
request, to another hearing six months later and at yearlyintervals after that. See La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art.
655(B) (West Supp. 1991).3 In addition, Louisiana law pro-vides that a release hearing must be held upon recommendation by the superintendent of a mental institution. See Art.655(A).

4 In early 1988, Feliciana's superintendent recomlaw; however, the assignment of reasons shall not delay the implementation of judgment."

3 Article 655(B) provides:

"A person committed pursuant to Article 654 may make application to
the review panel for discharge or for release on probation. Such application by a committed person may not be filed until the committed person
has been confined for a period of at least six months after the original
commitment. If the review panel recommends to the court that the person be discharged, conditionally or unconditionally, or placed on probation,
the court shall conduct a hearing following notice to the district attorney.
If the recommendation of the review panel or the court is adverse, the
applicant shall not be permitted to file another application until one year
has elapsed from the date of determination."

4 Article 655(A) provides:

"When the superintendent of a mental institution is of the opinion that
a person committed pursuant to Article 654 can be discharged or can be
released on probation, without danger to others or to himself, he shall
recommend the discharge or release of the person in a report to a review
panel comprised of the person's treating physician, the clinical director of
the facility to which the person is committed, and a physician or psychologist who served on the sanity commission which recommended commitment of the person. If any member of the panel is unable to serve, a

mended that Foucha be released, and a three-doctor panelmet to review the case. On March 21, 1988, the panel issued

a report pursuant to Article 656.5 The panel concluded that"there is no evidence of mental illness." App. 10. In fact,
the panel stated that there was "never any evidence of
mental illness or disease since admission." Ibid. (emphasis
added). Although the panel did not discuss whether Foucha
was dangerous, it recommended to the trial court that he be
conditionally released.

As a result of these recommendations, the trial court
scheduled a hearing to determine whether Foucha should be
released. Under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 657 (West
Supp. 1991),6 Foucha had the burden at this hearing to prove

physician or a psychologist engaged in the practice of clinical or counseling
psychology with at least three years' experience in the field of mental
health shall be appointed by the remaining members. The panel shall
review all reports received promptly. After review, the panel shall make
a recommendation to the court by which the person was committed as to
the person's mental condition and whether he can be discharged, conditionally or unconditionally, or placed on probation, without being a danger to
others or himself. If the review panel recommends to the court that the
person be discharged, conditionally or unconditionally, or placed on probation, the court shall conduct a contradictory hearing following notice to
the district attorney."

5 Article 656 provides:

"A. Upon receipt of the superintendent's report, filed in conformity with
Article 655, the review panel may examine the committed person and report, to the court promptly, whether he can be safely discharged, conditionally or unconditionally, or be safely released on probation, without danger to others or to himself.

"B. The committed person or the district attorney may also retain a
physician to examine the committed person for the same purpose. The
physician's report shall be filed with the court."

that he could be released without danger to others or to him-self. The court appointed two experts (the same doctors

who had examined Foucha at the time of his original commit-ment) to evaluate his dangerousness. These doctors concluded that Foucha "is presently in remission from mentalillness," but said that they could not "certify that he would
not constitute a menace to himself or to others if released."App. 12. On November 29, 1988, the trial court held the
hearing, at which Foucha was represented by counsel. Thecourt concluded that Foucha "is a danger to himself, and to
others," id., at 24, and ordered that he be returned toFeliciana.

to prove that he can be discharged, or can be released on probation, without danger to others or to himself. After the hearing, and upon filing
written findings of fact and conclusions of law, the court may order the
committed person discharged, released on probation subject to specified
conditions for a fixed or an indeterminate period, or recommitted to the
state mental institution. Notice to the counsel for the committed person
and the district attorney of the contradictory hearing shall be given at
least thirty days prior to the hearing."

be released without danger to others or to himself under La. Code Crim.

108 FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA

Thomas, J., dissenting
That being the case, he is entitled to the same treatment ascivil committees. "

[I]f Foucha can no longer be held as an
insanity acquittee," the Court says, "he is entitled to consti-tutionally adequate procedures [those afforded in civil commitment proceedings] to establish the grounds for his confinement." Ante, at 79 (emphasis added). This, of course,is an equal protection argument (there being no rational distinction between A and B, the State must treat them thesame); the Court does not even pretend to examine the fairness of the release procedures the State has provided.I cannot agree with the Court's conclusion because I believe that there is a real and legitimate distinction between
insanity acquittees and civil committees that justifies procedural disparities. Unlike civil committees, who have not
been found to have harmed society, insanity acquittees have
been found in a judicial proceeding to have committed a
criminal act.

That distinction provided the ratio decidendi for our most
relevant precedent, Jones v. United States, 463 U. S. 354
(1983). That case involved a man who had been automatically committed to a mental institution after being acquitted
of a crime by reason of insanity in the District of Columbia
(i. e., he had not been given the procedures afforded to civil
committees). We rejected both of his procedural due process challenges to his commitment. First, we held that an
insanity acquittal justified automatic commitment of the acquittee (even though he might presently be sane), because
Congress was entitled to decide that the verdict provided a
reasonable basis for inferring dangerousness and insanity at
the time of commitment. Id., at 366. The Government's interest in avoiding a de novo commitment hearing following
every insanity acquittal, we said, outweighed the acquittee's
interest in avoiding unjustified institutionalization. Ibid.
Second, we held that the Constitution did not require, as a
predicate for the indefinite commitment of insanity acquittees, proof of insanity by "clear and convincing" evidence, as

required for civil committees by Addington v. Texas, 441U. S. 418 (1979). There are, we recognized, "important differences between the class of potential civil-commitment can-didates and the class of insanity acquittees that justify differing standards of proof." Jones, 463 U. S., at 367. In sharpcontrast to a civil committee, an insanity acquittee is institutionalized only where "the acquittee himself advances insan-ity as a defense and proves that his criminal act was a product of his mental illness," and thus "there is good reason fordiminished concern as to the risk of error."

Ibid. (emphasisin original). "More important, the proof that he committed

a criminal act . . . eliminates the risk that he is being com-mitted for mere `idiosyncratic behavior.' "

Ibid. Thus, weconcluded, the preponderance of the evidence standard comports with due process for commitment of insanity acquit-tees. Id., at 368. "[I]nsanity acquittees constitute a special
class that should be treated differently from other candidatesfor commitment." Id., at 370.

The Court today attempts to circumvent Jones by declar-ing that a State's interest in treating insanity acquittees differently from civil committees evaporates the instant anacquittee "becomes sane." I do not agree. As an initial
matter, I believe that it is unwise, given our present under-standing of the human mind, to suggest that a determination
that a person has "regained sanity" is precise. "Psychiatryis not . . . an exact science, and psychiatrists disagree widely
and frequently on what constitutes mental illness." Ake v.Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, 81 (1985). Indeed,

"[w]e have recognized repeatedly the `uncertainty of di-agnosis in this field and the tentativeness of professional
judgment. The only certain thing that can be saidabout the present state of knowledge and therapy regarding mental disease is that science has not reachedfinality of judgment.' The lesson we have drawn is not
that government may not act in the face of this un-certainty, but rather that courts should pay particular

deference to reasonable legislative judgments." Jones,supra, at 365, n. 13 (quoting Greenwood v. United States,

350 U. S. 366, 375 (1956); citations omitted).
In this very case, the panel that evaluated Foucha in 1988concluded that there was "

never any evidence of mental ill-ness or disease since admission," App. 10; the trial court, of

course, concluded that Foucha was "presently insane," id., at6, at the time it accepted his plea and sent him to Feliciana.

The distinction between civil committees and insanity ac-quittees, after all, turns

not on considerations of present san-ity, but instead on the fact that the latter have "already unhappily manifested the reality of anti-social conduct," Dixonv. Jacobs, 138 U. S. App. D. C. 319, 334, 427 F. 2d 589, 604
(1970) (Leventhal, J., concurring). "[T]he prior anti-socialconduct of an insanity acquittee justifies treating such a person differently from ones otherwise civilly committed forpurposes of deciding whether the patient should be released." Powell v. Florida, 579 F. 2d 324, 333 (CA5 1978)(emphasis added); see also

United States v. Ecker, 177 U. S.App. D. C. 31, 50, 543 F. 2d 178, 197 (1976), cert. denied, 429

U. S. 1063 (1977). While a State may renounce a punitiveinterest by offering an insanity defense, it does not follow
that, once the acquittee's sanity is "restored," the State isrequired to ignore his criminal act, and to renounce all interest in protecting society from him. "The state has a sub-stantial interest in avoiding premature release of insanity
acquittees, who have committed acts constituting feloniesand have been declared dangerous to society."

Hickey v.Morris, 722 F. 2d 543, 548 (CA9 1983).

Furthermore, the Federal Constitution does not require aState to "ignore the danger of `calculated abuse of the insanity defense.' " Warren v. Harvey, 632 F. 2d 925, 932 (CA21980) (quoting

United States v. Brown, 155 U. S. App. D. C.402, 407, 478 F. 2d 606, 611 (1973)). A State that decides to

offer its criminal defendants an insanity defense, which thedefendant himself is given the choice of invoking, is surely

allowed to attach to that defense certain consequences thatprevent abuse. Cf. Lynch v. Overholser, 369 U. S. 705, 715

(1962) ("Congress might have considered it appropriate toprovide compulsory commitment for those who successfully
invoke an insanity defense in order to discourage false pleasof insanity").

"In effect, the defendant, by raising the defense of insan-ity--and he alone can raise it--postpones a determination of his present mental health and acknowledges theright of the state, upon accepting his plea, to detain him
for diagnosis, care, and custody in a mental institutionuntil certain specified conditions are met. . . . [C]ommitment via the criminal process . . . thus is more akinto `voluntary' than `involuntary' civil commitment."
Goldstein & Katz, Dangerousness and Mental Illness,Some Observations on the Decision to Release Persons
Acquitted by Reason of Insanity, 70 Yale L. J. 225, 230(1960) (footnote omitted).

A State may reasonably decide that the integrity of aninsanity-acquittal scheme requires the continued commitment of insanity acquittees who remain dangerous. Surely,the citizenry would not long tolerate the insanity defense if
a serial killer who convinces a jury that he is not guilty byreason of insanity is returned to the streets immediately
after trial by convincing a different factfinder that he is notin fact insane.

As the American Law Institute has explained:

"It seemed preferable to the Institute to make danger-ousness the criterion for continued custody, rather than

to provide that the committed person may be dischargedor released when restored to sanity as defined by the
mental hygiene laws. Although his mental disease mayhave greatly improved, [an insanity acquittee] may still
be dangerous because of factors in his personality andbackground other than mental disease. Also, such a

who successfully feigned mental disease to gain anacquittal." Model Penal Code $ 4.08, Comment 3,
pp. 259-260 (1985).8
That this is a reasonable legislative judgment is underscoredby the fact that it has been made by no fewer than 11 state

legislatures, in addition to Louisiana's, which expressly pro-vide that insanity acquittees shall not be released as long as
they are dangerous, regardless of sanity.9

8 The relevant provision of the Model Penal Code, strikingly similar to
Article 657 of the Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure, see supra, n. 6,
provides in part as follows:

"If the Court is satisfied by the report filed pursuant to Subsection (2) of
this Section and such testimony of the reporting psychiatrists as the Court
deems necessary that the committed person may be discharged or released
on condition without danger to himself or others, the Court shall order his
discharge or his release on such conditions as the Court determines to be
necessary. If the Court is not so satisfied, it shall promptly order a hearing to determine whether such person may safely be discharged or released. Any such hearing shall be deemed a civil proceeding and the burden shall be upon the committed person to prove that he may safely be
discharged or released." Model Penal Code $ 4.08(3) (Proposed Official
Draft 1962).

9 See Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 1026.2(e) (West Supp. 1992) (insanity acquittee not entitled to release until court determines that he "will not be a
danger to the health and safety of others, including himself"); Del. Code
Ann., Tit. 11, $ 403(b) (1987) (insanity acquittee shall be kept institutionalized until court "is satisfied that the public safety will not be endangered
by his release"); Haw. Rev. Stat. $ 704-415 (1985) (insanity acquittee not

The Court suggests an alternative "procedural" due proc-ess theory that is, if anything, even less persuasive than its

principal theory. "[K]eeping Foucha against his will in amental institution is improper absent a determination in
civil commitment proceedings of current mental illness anddangerousness."

Ante, at 78 (emphasis added). The Courtcites Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S. 480 (1980), as support. There

are two problems with this theory. First, it is illogical: Lou-isiana cannot possibly extend Foucha's incarceration by adding the procedures afforded to civil committees, since it isimpossible to civilly commit someone who is not presently

to others of serious property damage if conditionally released").

The Court and the concurrence dispute this list of statutes. Ante, at
84-85, n. 6; ante, at 89 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment). They note that two of the States have enacted new laws,
not yet effective, modifying their current absolute prohibitions on the release of dangerous insanity acquittees; that courts in two other States
have apparently held that mental illness is a prerequisite to confinement;
and that three of the States place caps of some sort on the duration of the
confinement of insanity acquittees. Those criticisms miss my point. I
cite the 11 state statutes above only to show that the legislative judgments
underlying Louisiana's scheme are far from unique or freakish, and that
there is no well-established practice in our society, either past or present,
of automatically releasing sane-but-dangerous insanity acquittees.

Thomas, J., dissenting
mentally ill. Second, the theory is not supported by Vitek.Stigmatization (our concern in Vitek) is simply not a relevant

consideration where insanity acquittees are involved. Aswe explained in Jones: "A criminal defendant who successfully raises the insanity defense necessarily is stigmatizedby the verdict itself, and thus the commitment causes little
additional harm in this respect." 463 U. S., at 367, n. 16; seealso

Warren v. Harvey, 632 F. 2d, at 931-932. (This is insharp contrast to situations involving civil committees. See

Addington, 441 U. S., at 425-426; Vitek, supra, at 492-494.)It is implausible, in my view, that a person who chooses to
plead not guilty by reason of insanity and then spends sev-eral years in a mental institution becomes unconstitutionally
stigmatized by continued confinement in the institution after"regaining" sanity.

In my view, there was no procedural due process violationin this case. Articles 654, 655, and 657 of the Louisiana
Code of Criminal Procedure, as noted above, afford insanityacquittees the opportunity to obtain release by demonstrating at regular intervals that they no longer pose a threat tosociety. These provisions also afford judicial review of such
determinations. Pursuant to these procedures, and basedupon testimony of experts, the Louisiana courts determined
not to release Foucha at this time because the evidence didnot show that he ceased to be dangerous. Throughout these
proceedings, Foucha was represented by state-appointedcounsel. I see no plausible argument that these procedures
denied Foucha a fair hearing on the issue involved or thatFoucha needed additional procedural protections.

10 See

Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319 (1976); Patterson v. NewYork, 432 U. S. 197 (1977); cf. Addington, supra, at 427-432;

10 Foucha has not argued that the State's procedures, as applied, are a
sham. This would be a different case if Foucha had established that the
statutory mechanisms for release were nothing more than window
dressing, and that the State in fact confined insanity acquittees indefinitely
without meaningful opportunity for review and release.

B
The Court next concludes that Louisiana's statutoryscheme must fall because it violates Foucha's substantive

due process rights. Ante, at 80-83, and n. 6. I disagree.Until today, I had thought that the analytical framework for
evaluating substantive due process claims was relativelystraightforward. Certain substantive rights we have recognized as "fundamental"; legislation trenching upon these issubjected to "strict scrutiny," and generally will be invalidated unless the State demonstrates a compelling interestand narrow tailoring. Such searching judicial review of
state legislation, however, is the exception, not the rule, inour democratic and federal system; we have consistently emphasized that "the Court has no license to invalidate legisla-tion which it thinks merely arbitrary or unreasonable." Regents of University of Michigan v. Ewing, 474 U. S. 214, 226(1985) (internal quotation marks omitted). Except in the
unusual case where a fundamental right is infringed, then,federal judicial scrutiny of the substance of state legislation
under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendmentis not exacting. See,

e. g., Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S.186, 191-196 (1986).

In striking down Louisiana's scheme as a violation of sub-stantive rights guaranteed by the Due Process Clause, the

11 As explained above, the Court's "procedural" due process analysis is
essentially an equal protection analysis: The Court first disregards the
differences between "sane" insanity acquittees and civil committees, and
then simply asserts that Louisiana cannot deny Foucha the procedures it
gives civil committees. A plurality repeats this analysis in its cumulative
equal protection section. See ante, at 84-86. As explained above, I believe that there are legitimate differences between civil committees and
insanity acquittees, even after the latter have "become" sane. Therefore,
in my view, Louisiana has not denied Foucha equal protection of the laws.
Cf. Jones v. United States, 463 U. S. 354, 362, n. 10 (1983).

116 FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA

Thomas, J., dissenting
Court today ignores this well-established analytical frame-work. First, the Court never explains whether we are dealing here with a fundamental right, and, if so, what right.Second, the Court never discloses what standard of review
applies. Indeed, the Court's opinion is contradictory on
both these critical points.As to the first point: The Court begins its substantive due

process analysis by invoking the substantive right to "[f]ree-dom from bodily restraint."

Ante, at 80. Its discussion
then proceeds as if the problem here is that Foucha, an insan-ity acquittee, continues to be

confined after recovering his
sanity, ante, at 80-81; thus, the Court contrasts this case
to United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739 (1987), a case involving the confinement of pretrial detainees. But then,
abruptly, the Court shifts liberty interests. The liberty interest at stake here, we are told, is not a liberty interest in
being free "from bodily restraint," but instead the more specific (and heretofore unknown) "liberty interest under the
Constitution in being freed from [1] indefinite confinement
[2] in a mental facility." Ante, at 82 (emphasis added).
See also ante, at 86-87 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment). So the problem in this case is
apparently not that Louisiana continues to confine insanity
acquittees who have "become" sane (although earlier in the
opinion the Court interprets our decision in Jones as having
held that such confinement is unconstitutional, see ante, at
77-78), but that under Louisiana law, "sane" insanity acquittees may be held "indefinitely" "in a mental facility."

As to the second point: "A dispute regarding the appropriate standard of review may strike some as a lawyers'
quibble over words, but it is not." Metro Broadcasting, Inc.
v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 610 (1990) (O'Connor, J., dissenting).
The standard of review determines when the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment will override a State's
substantive policy choices, as reflected in its laws. The
Court initially says that "[d]ue process requires that the na504US1$69N 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT

117Cite as: 504 U. S. 71 (1992)
Thomas, J., dissenting
ture of commitment bear some reasonable relation to thepurpose for which the individual is committed." Ante, at 79

(emphasis added). Later in its opinion, however, the Courtstates that the Louisiana scheme violates substantive due
process not because it is not "reasonably related" to theState's purposes, but instead because its detention provisions
are not "sharply focused" or "carefully limited," in contrastto the scheme we upheld in

Salerno. Ante, at 81. Doesthat mean that the same standard of review applies here that

we applied in Salerno, and, if so, what is that standard?The Court quite pointedly avoids answering these questions.
Similarly, Justice O'Connor does not reveal exactly whatstandard of review she believes applicable, but appears to
advocate a heightened standard heretofore unknown in ourcase law.

Ante, at 87-88 ("It might therefore be permissiblefor Louisiana to confine an insanity acquittee who has regained sanity if . . . the nature and duration of detention weretailored to reflect pressing public safety concerns related to
the acquittee's continuing dangerousness" (emphasis added)).To the extent the Court invalidates the Louisiana scheme
on the ground that it violates some general substantive dueprocess right to "freedom from bodily restraint" that triggers strict scrutiny, it is wrong--and dangerously so. Tothe extent the Court suggests that Louisiana has violated
some more limited right to freedom from indefinite commit-ment in a mental facility (a right, by the way, never asserted
by Foucha in this or any other court) that triggers some un-known standard of review, it is also wrong. I shall discuss
these two possibilities in turn.

1
I fully agree with the Court, ante, at 80, and with Justice
Kennedy, ante, at 90, that freedom from involuntary con-finement is at the heart of the "liberty" protected by the Due

Process Clause. But a liberty interest per se is not the samething as a fundamental right. Whatever the exact scope of

504US1$69N 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT
118 FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA

Thomas, J., dissenting
the fundamental right to "freedom from bodily restraint"
recognized by our cases,12 it certainly cannot be defined at
the exceedingly great level of generality the Court suggests
today. There is simply no basis in our society's history or
in the precedents of this Court to support the existence of a
sweeping, general fundamental right to "freedom from bodily
restraint" applicable to all persons in all contexts. If convicted prisoners could claim such a right, for example, we
would subject all prison sentences to strict scrutiny. This
we have consistently refused to do. See, e. g., Chapman v.
United States, 500 U. S. 453, 465 (1991).13

The critical question here, then, is whether insanity acquittees have a fundamental right to "freedom from bodily

12 The Court cites only Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U. S. 307, 316 (1982), in
support of its assertion that "[f]reedom from bodily restraint has always
been at the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause from
arbitrary governmental action," ante, at 80. What "freedom from bodily
restraint" meant in that case, however, is completely different from what
the Court uses the phrase to mean here. Youngberg involved the substantive due process rights of an institutionalized, mentally retarded patient
who had been restrained by shackles placed on his arms for portions of
each day. See 457 U. S., at 310, and n. 4. What the Court meant by
"freedom from bodily restraint," then, was quite literally freedom not to
be physically strapped to a bed. That case in no way established the
broad "freedom from bodily restraint"--apparently meaning freedom from
all involuntary confinement--that the Court discusses today.

13 Unless the Court wishes to overturn this line of cases, its substantive

due process analysis must rest entirely on the fact that an insanity acquittee has not been convicted of a crime. Conviction is, of course, a significant event. But I am not sure that it deserves talismanic significance.
Once a State proves beyond a reasonable doubt that an individual has
committed a crime, it is, at a minimum, not obviously a matter of federal
constitutional concern whether the State proceeds to label that individual
"guilty," "guilty but insane," or "not guilty by reason of insanity." A
State may just as well decide to label its verdicts "A," "B," and "C." It
is surely rather odd to have rules of federal constitutional law turn entirely upon the label chosen by a State. Cf. Railway Express Agency,
Inc. v. Virginia, 358 U. S. 434, 441 (1959) (constitutionality of state action
should not turn on "magic words").

restraint" that triggers strict scrutiny of their confinement.Neither Foucha nor the Court provides any evidence that our

society has ever recognized any such right. To the contrary,historical evidence shows that many States have long
provided for the continued institutionalization of insanity
acquittees who remain dangerous. See, e. g., H. Weihofen,Insanity as a Defense in Criminal Law 294-332 (1933); A.

Goldstein, The Insanity Defense 148-149 (1967).Moreover, this Court has

never applied strict scrutiny to
the substance of state laws involving involuntary confine-ment of the mentally ill, much less to laws involving the confinement of insanity acquittees. To the contrary, until today
we have subjected the substance of such laws only to very
deferential review. Thus, in Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U. S.
715, 738 (1972), we held that Indiana's provisions for the indefinite institutionalization of incompetent defendants violated substantive due process because they did not bear any
"reasonable" relation to the purpose for which the defendant
was committed. Similarly, in O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422
U. S. 563 (1975), we held that the confinement of a nondangerous mentally ill person was unconstitutional not because
the State failed to show a compelling interest and narrow
tailoring, but because the State had no legitimate interest
whatsoever to justify such confinement. See id., at 575-576.
See also id., at 580 (Burger, C. J., concurring) ("Commitment
must be justified on the basis of a legitimate state interest,
and the reasons for committing a particular individual must
be established in an appropriate proceeding. Equally important, confinement must cease when those reasons no
longer exist" (emphasis added)).

Similarly, in Jones, we held (in addition to the procedural
due process holdings described above) that there was no substantive due process bar to holding an insanity acquittee beyond the period for which he could have been incarcerated
if convicted. We began by explaining the standard for our
analysis: "The Due Process Clause `requires that the nature

purposes underlying commitment of insanity acquittees [in
the District of Columbia,]" which we identified as treatment
of the insanity acquittee's mental illness and protection of
the acquittee and society, "petitioner clearly errs in contending that an acquittee's hypothetical maximum sentence provides the constitutional limit for his commitment." 463
U. S., at 368 (emphasis added). Given that the commitment
law was reasonably related to Congress' purposes, this Court
had no basis for invalidating it as a matter of substantive
due process.

It is simply wrong for the Court to assert today that we
"held" in Jones that " `the committed acquittee is entitled
to release when he has recovered his sanity or is no longer
dangerous.' " Ante, at 77 (quoting Jones, 463 U. S., at 368).14
We specifically noted in Jones that no issue regarding

the standards for the release of insanity acquittees was before us. Id., at 363, n. 11. The question we were answering
in the part of Jones from which the Court quotes was
whether it is permissible to hold an insanity acquittee for a
period longer than he could have been incarcerated if convicted, not whether it is permissible to hold him once he
becomes "sane." As noted above, our substantive due process analysis in Jones was straightforward: Did the means
chosen by Congress (commitment of insanity acquittees until

"that Louisiana may never confine dangerous insanity acquittees after
they regain mental health." Ante, at 87. Either it is true that, as a
matter of substantive due process, an insanity acquittee is " `entitled to
release when he has recovered his sanity,' " ante, at 77 (quoting Jones, 463
U. S., at 368), or it is not. The Court apparently cannot make up its mind.

they have recovered their sanity or are no longer dangerous) reasonably fit Congress' ends (treatment of the acquittee's mental illness and protection of society from his
dangerousness)? 15

In its arguments before this Court, Louisiana chose to
place primary reliance on our decision in United States v.
Salerno, 481 U. S. 739 (1987), in which we upheld provisions
of the Bail Reform Act of 1984 that allowed limited pretrial
detention of criminal suspects. That case, as the Court
notes, ante, at 81-83, is readily distinguishable. Insanity acquittees, in sharp and obvious contrast to pretrial detainees,
have had their day in court. Although they have not been
convicted of crimes, neither have they been exonerated, as
they would have been upon a determination of "not guilty"
simpliciter. Insanity acquittees thus stand in a fundamentally different position from persons who have not
been adjudicated to have committed criminal acts. That is
what distinguishes this case (and what distinguished Jones)
from Salerno and Jackson v. Indiana, supra. In Jackson, as in Salerno, the State had not proved beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused had committed criminal
acts or otherwise was dangerous. See Jones, supra, at 364,
n. 12. The Court disregards this critical distinction, and apparently deems applicable the same scrutiny to pretrial de15 As may be apparent from the discussion in text, we have not been
entirely precise as to the appropriate standard of review of legislation in
this area. Some of our cases (e. g., O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U. S. 563
(1975)) have used the language of rationality review; others (e. g., Jackson
v. Indiana, 406 U. S. 715 (1972)) have used the language of "reasonableness," which may imply a somewhat heightened standard; still others (e. g.,
Jones) have used the language of both rationality and reasonableness.
What is clear from our cases is that the appropriate scrutiny is highly
deferential, not strict. We need not decide in this case which precise
standard is applicable, since the laws under attack here are at the very
least reasonable.

Thomas, J., dissenting
tainees as to persons determined in a judicial proceeding to
have committed a criminal act.16

If the Court indeed means to suggest that all restrictions
on "freedom from bodily restraint" are subject to strict scrutiny, it has (at a minimum) wrought a revolution in the treatment of the mentally ill. Civil commitment as we know it
would almost certainly be unconstitutional; only in the rarest
of circumstances will a State be able to show a "compelling
interest," and one that can be served in no other way, in
involuntarily institutionalizing a person. All procedures involving the confinement of insanity acquittees and civil committees would require revamping to meet strict scrutiny.
Thus, to take one obvious example, the automatic commitment of insanity acquittees that we expressly upheld in
Jones would be clearly unconstitutional, since it is inconceivable that such commitment of persons who may well presently be sane and nondangerous could survive strict scrutiny.
(In Jones, of course, we applied no such scrutiny; we upheld
the practice not because it was justified by a compelling in16 The Court asserts that the principles set forth in this dissent necessarily apply not only to insanity acquittees, but also to convicted prisoners.
"Justice Thomas' rationale for continuing to hold the insanity acquittee
would surely justify treating the convicted felon in the same way, and if
put to it, it appears that he would permit it." Ante, at 83, n. 6. That is
obviously not so. If Foucha had been convicted of the crimes with which
he was charged and sentenced to the statutory maximum of 32 years in
prison, the State would not be entitled to extend his sentence at the end
of that period. To do so would obviously violate the prohibition on ex post
facto laws set forth in Art. I, $ 10, cl. 1. But Foucha was not sentenced to
incarceration for any definite period of time; to the contrary, he pleaded
not guilty by reason of insanity and was ordered institutionalized until he
was able to meet the conditions statutorily prescribed for his release. To
acknowledge, as I do, that it is constitutionally permissible for a State
to provide for the continued confinement of an insanity acquittee who
remains dangerous is obviously quite different than to assert that the
State is allowed to confine anyone who is dangerous for as long as it
wishes.

terest, but because it was based on reasonable legislativeinferences about continuing insanity and dangerousness.)

2
As explained above, the Court's opinion is profoundly am-biguous on the central question in this case: Must the State

of Louisiana release Terry Foucha now that he has "re-gained" his sanity? In other words, is the defect in Louisiana's statutory scheme that it provides for the confinementof insanity acquittees who have recovered their sanity, or
instead that it allows the State to confine sane insanity ac-quittees (1) indefinitely (2) in a mental facility? To the extent the Court suggests the former, I have already explainedwhy it is wrong. I turn now to the latter possibility, which
also is mistaken.To begin with, I think it is somewhat misleading to describe Louisiana's scheme as providing for the "indefinite"commitment of insanity acquittees. As explained above, insanity acquittees are entitled to a release hearing every yearat their request, and at any time at the request of a facility
superintendent. Like the District of Columbia statute atissue in Jones, then, Louisiana's statute provides for "indefinite" commitment only to the extent that an acquittee is un-able to satisfy the substantive standards for release. If the
Constitution did not require a cap on the acquittee's con-finement in

Jones, why does it require one here? The Courtand
Justice O'Connor have no basis for suggesting thateither this Court or the society of which it is a part has

recognized some general fundamental right to "freedom fromindefinite commitment." If that were the case, of course,
Jones would have involved strict scrutiny and is wronglydecided.

Furthermore, any concerns about "indefinite" commitmenthere are entirely hypothetical and speculative. Foucha has
been confined for eight years. Had he been convicted of thecrimes with which he was charged, he could have been incar504US1$69N 02-20-99 17:46:02 PAGES OPINPGT
124 FOUCHA v. LOUISIANA

Thomas, J., dissenting
cerated for 32 years. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $$ 14:60, 14:94(West 1986). Thus, I find quite odd

Justice O'Connor'ssuggestion,
ante, at 89, that this case might be different hadLouisiana, like the State of Washington, limited confinement

to the period for which a defendant might have been impris-oned if convicted. Foucha, of course, would be in precisely
the same position today--and for the next 24 years--had theLouisiana statute included such a cap. Thus, the Court apparently finds fault with the Louisiana statute not becauseit has been applied to Foucha in an unconstitutional manner,
but because the Court can imagine it being applied to someone else in an unconstitutional manner. That goes againstthe first principles of our jurisprudence. See,

e. g., Salerno,481 U. S., at 745 ("The fact that [a detention statute] might

operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of cir-cumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid, since
we have not recognized an `overbreadth' doctrine outside thelimited context of the First Amendment").

17

Finally, I see no basis for holding that the Due ProcessClause per se prohibits a State from continuing to confine in

a "mental institution"--the federal constitutional definitionof which remains unclear--an insanity acquittee who has recovered his sanity. As noted above, many States have longprovided for the continued detention of insanity acquittees
who remain dangerous. Neither Foucha nor the Court pre-sent any evidence that these States have traditionally transferred such persons from mental institutions to other deten-tion facilities. Therefore, there is simply no basis for this
Court to recognize a "fundamental right" for a sane insanityacquittee to be transferred out of a mental facility. "In an
attempt to limit and guide interpretation of the [Due Proc-ess] Clause, we have insisted not merely that the interest

17 I fully agree with Justice O'Connor, ante, at 88, that there would
be a serious question of rationality had Louisiana sought to institutionalize
a sane insanity acquittee for a period longer than he might have been
imprisoned if convicted. But that is simply not the case here.

denominated as a `liberty' be `fundamental' (a concept that,in isolation, is hard to objectify), but also that it be an interest traditionally protected by our society." Michael H. v.Gerald D., 491 U. S. 110, 122 (1989) (plurality opinion).

Removing sane insanity acquittees from mental institu-tions may make eminent sense as a policy matter, but the
Due Process Clause does not require the States to conformto the policy preferences of federal judges. "The Court is
most vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when itdeals with judge-made constitutional law having little or no
cognizable roots in the language or design of the Constitu-tion."

Bowers, 478 U. S., at 194. I have no idea whatfacilities the Court or

Justice O'Connor believe the DueProcess Clause mandates for the confinement of sane-butdangerous insanity acquittees. Presumably prisons will notdo, since imprisonment is generally regarded as "punishment." May a State designate a wing of a mental insti-tution or prison for sane insanity acquittees? May a State
mix them with other detainees? Neither the Constitutionnor our society's traditions provide any answer to these
questions.18 3

18 In particular circumstances, of course, it may be unconstitutional for
a State to confine in a mental institution a person who is no longer insane.
This would be a different case had Foucha challenged specific conditions
of confinement--for instance, being forced to share a cell with an insane
person, or being involuntarily treated after recovering his sanity. But
Foucha has alleged nothing of the sort--all we know is that the State
continues to confine him in a place called the Feliciana Forensic Facility.
It is by no means clear that such confinement is invariably worse than,
for example, confinement in a jail or other detention center--for all we
know, an institution may provide a quieter, less violent atmosphere. I do
not mean to suggest that that is the case--my point is only that the issue
cannot be resolved in the abstract.

Syllabus

RIGGINS v. NEVADA
certiorari to the supreme court of nevada
No. 90-8466. Argued January 15, 1992--Decided May 18, 1992
When petitioner Riggins, while awaiting a Nevada trial on murder and

robbery charges, complained of hearing voices and having sleep problems, a psychiatrist prescribed the antipsychotic drug Mellaril. After
he was found competent to stand trial, Riggins made a motion to suspend the Mellaril's administration until after his trial, arguing that its
use infringed upon his freedom, that its effect on his demeanor and
mental state during trial would deny him due process, and that he had
the right to show jurors his true mental state when he offered an insanity defense. After hearing the testimony of doctors who had examined
Riggins, the trial court denied the motion with a one-page order giving
no indication of its rationale. At Riggins' trial, he presented his insanity defense and testified, was convicted, and was sentenced to death.
In affirming, the State Supreme Court held, inter alia, that expert testimony presented at trial was sufficient to inform the jury of the Mellaril's
effect on Riggins' demeanor and testimony.

Held: The forced administration of antipsychotic medication during Riggins' trial violated rights guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth
Amendments. Pp. 133-138.

(a) The record narrowly defines the issues in this case. Administration of Mellaril was involuntary once Riggins' motion to terminate its
use was denied, but its administration was medically appropriate. In
addition, Riggins' Eighth Amendment argument that the drug's administration denied him the opportunity to show jurors his true mental condition at the sentencing hearing was not raised below or in the
petition for certiorari and, thus, will not be considered by this Court.
P. 133.

(b) A pretrial detainee has an interest in avoiding involuntary administration of antipsychotic drugs that is protected under the Due Process
Clause. Cf. Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210; Bell v. Wolfish, 441
U. S. 520, 545. Once Riggins moved to terminate his treatment, the
State became obligated to establish both the need for Mellaril and its
medical appropriateness. Cf. Harper, supra, at 227. Due process certainly would have been satisfied had the State shown that the treatment
was medically appropriate and, considering less intrusive alternatives,
essential for Riggins' own safety or the safety of others. The State
also might have been able to justify the treatment, if medically appro504us1$70L 04-10-96 12:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT

Syllabus
priate, by showing that an adjudication of guilt or innocence could not
be obtained by using less intrusive means. However, the trial court
allowed the drug's administration to continue without making any determination of the need for this course or any findings about reasonable
alternatives, and it failed to acknowledge Riggins' liberty interest in
freedom from antipsychotic drugs. Pp. 133-137.

(c) There is a strong possibility that the trial court's error impaired
Riggins' constitutionally protected trial rights. Efforts to prove or
disprove actual prejudice from the record before this Court would be
futile, and guesses as to the trial's outcome had Riggins' motion been
granted would be speculative. While the precise consequences of forcing Mellaril upon him cannot be shown from a trial transcript, the testimony of doctors who examined Riggins establishes the strong possibility that his defense was impaired. Mellaril's side effects may have
impacted not only his outward appearance, but also his testimony's content, his ability to follow the proceedings, or the substance of his communication with counsel. Thus, even if the expert testimony presented
at trial allowed jurors to assess Riggins' demeanor fairly, an unacceptable risk remained that forced medication compromised his trial rights.
Pp. 137-138.

(d) While trial prejudice can sometimes be justified by an essential
state interest, the record here contains no finding to support a conclusion that administration of antipsychotic medication was necessary to
accomplish an essential state policy. P. 138.

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
Petitioner David Riggins challenges his murder and rob-bery convictions on the ground that the State of Nevada unconstitutionally forced an antipsychotic drug upon him dur-ing trial. Because the Nevada courts failed to make findings
sufficient to support forced administration of the drug, wereverse.

I
During the early hours of November 20, 1987, Paul Wadewas found dead in his Las Vegas apartment. An autopsy

revealed that Wade died from multiple stab wounds, includ-ing wounds to the head, chest, and back. David Riggins was
arrested for the killing 45 hours later.A few days after being taken into custody, Riggins told
Dr. R. Edward Quass, a private psychiatrist who treated pa-tients at the Clark County Jail, about hearing voices in his
head and having trouble sleeping. Riggins informed Dr.Quass that he had been successfully treated with Mellaril
in the past. Mellaril is the trade name for thioridazine, anantipsychotic drug. After this consultation, Dr. Quass prescribed Mellaril at a level of 100 milligrams per day. Be-cause Riggins continued to complain of voices and sleep problems in the following months, Dr. Quass gradually increasedthe Mellaril prescription to 800 milligrams per day. Riggins
also received a prescription for Dilantin, an antiepilepticdrug.

In January 1988, Riggins successfully moved for a deter-mination of his competence to stand trial. App. 6. Three

130 RIGGINS v. NEVADA

Opinion of the Court
court-appointed psychiatrists performed examinations during February and March, while Riggins was taking 450 milligrams of Mellaril daily. Dr. William O'Gorman, a psychiatrist who had treated Riggins for anxiety in 1982, and Dr.
Franklin Master concluded that Riggins was competent to
stand trial. The third psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Jurasky, found
that Riggins was incompetent. The Clark County District
Court determined that Riggins was legally sane and competent to stand trial, id., at 13, so preparations for trial went
forward.

In early June, the defense moved the District Court for an
order suspending administration of Mellaril and Dilantin
until the end of Riggins' trial. Id., at 20. Relying on both
the Fourteenth Amendment and the Nevada Constitution,
Riggins argued that continued administration of these drugs
infringed upon his freedom and that the drugs' effect on his
demeanor and mental state during trial would deny him due
process. Riggins also asserted that, because he would offer
an insanity defense at trial, he had a right to show jurors his
"true mental state." Id., at 22. In response, the State
noted that Nevada law prohibits the trial of incompetent
persons, see Nev. Rev. Stat. $ 178.400 (1989), and argued
that the court therefore had authority to compel Riggins to
take medication necessary to ensure his competence. App.
31-32.

On July 14, 1988, the District Court held an evidentiary
hearing on Riggins' motion. At the hearing, Dr. Master
"guess[ed]" that taking Riggins off medication would not noticeably alter his behavior or render him incompetent to
stand trial. Record 412. Dr. Quass testified that, in his
opinion, Riggins would be competent to stand trial even
without the administration of Mellaril, but that the effects
of Mellaril would not be noticeable to jurors if medication
continued. Id., at 443-445. Finally, Dr. O'Gorman told the
court that Mellaril made the defendant calmer and more re504us1$70L 04-10-96 12:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT

131Cite as: 504 U. S. 127 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
laxed but that an excessive dose would cause drowsiness.
Id., at 464-466. Dr. O'Gorman was unable to predict how
Riggins might behave if taken off antipsychotic medication,
yet he questioned the need to give Riggins the high dose he
was receiving. Id., at 474-476. The court also had before
it a written report in which Dr. Jurasky held to his earlier
view that Riggins was incompetent to stand trial and predicted that if taken off Mellaril the defendant "would most
likely regress to a manifest psychosis and become extremely
difficult to manage." App. 19.

The District Court denied Riggins' motion to terminate
medication with a one-page order that gave no indication of
the court's rationale. Id., at 49. Riggins continued to receive 800 milligrams of Mellaril each day through the completion of his trial the following November.

At trial, Riggins presented an insanity defense and testified on his own behalf. He indicated that on the night of
Wade's death he used cocaine before going to Wade's apartment. Riggins admitted fighting with Wade, but claimed
that Wade was trying to kill him and that voices in his head
said that killing Wade would be justifiable homicide. A jury
found Riggins guilty of murder with use of a deadly weapon
and robbery with use of a deadly weapon. After a penalty
hearing, the same jury set the murder sentence at death.

Riggins presented several claims to the Nevada Supreme
Court, among them that forced administration of Mellaril denied him the ability to assist in his own defense and prejudicially affected his attitude, appearance, and demeanor at
trial. This prejudice was not justified, Riggins said in his
opening brief, because the State neither demonstrated a
need to administer Mellaril nor explored alternatives to giving him 800 milligrams of the drug each day. Record 1020.
Riggins amplified this claim in his reply brief, objecting that
the State intruded upon his constitutionally protected lib504us1$70L 04-10-96 12:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT
132 RIGGINS v. NEVADA

Opinion of the Court
erty interest in freedom from antipsychotic drugs withoutconsidering less intrusive options. Riggins argued:

"In United States v. Bryant, 670 F. Supp. 840, 843(Minn. 1987)[,] the court, in reference to medicating prisoners against their will, stated that `courts have recog-nized a

protectable liberty interest . . . in the freedom
to avoid unwanted medication with such drugs.' Thecourt in so stating cited

Bee v. Greaves, 744 F. 2d 1387
(10th Cir. 1984)[,] which addressed the issue of medicat-ing pre-trial detainees and stated that `less restrictive

alternatives, such as segregation or the use of less controversial drugs like tranquilizers or sedatives, shouldbe ruled out before resorting to antipsychotic drugs.'

In the case at bar, no less restrictive alternatives wereutilized, considered or even proposed." Record 1070-
1071 (emphasis in original).
The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed Riggins' convictions
and death sentence. 107 Nev. 178, 808 P. 2d 535 (1991).With respect to administration of Mellaril, the court held

that expert testimony presented at trial "was sufficient toinform the jury of the effect of the Mellaril on Riggins' demeanor and testimony." Id., at 181, 808 P. 2d, at 538. Thus,although Riggins' demeanor was relevant to his insanity defense, the court held that denial of the defense's motion to
terminate medication was neither an abuse of discretion nora violation of Riggins' trial rights. In a concurring opinion,

Justice Rose suggested that the District Court should havedetermined whether administration of Mellaril during trial
was "absolutely necessary" by ordering a pretrial suspension
of medication. Id., at 185, 808 P. 2d, at 540 (concurring opinion). Justice Springer dissented, arguing that antipsychotic
drugs may never be forced on a criminal defendant solely to
allow prosecution. Id., at 186, 808 P. 2d, at 541.

We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 807 (1991), to decide
whether forced administration of antipsychotic medication

Opinion of the Court
during trial violated rights guaranteed by the Sixth andFourteenth Amendments.

II
The record in this case narrowly defines the issues beforeus. The parties have indicated that once the District Court

denied Riggins' motion to terminate use of Mellaril, subse-quent administration of the drug was involuntary. See,

e. g.,Brief for Petitioner 6 (medication was "forced"); Brief for

Respondent 14, 22, 28 (describing medication as "unwanted,""over objection," and "compelled"). This understanding accords with the determination of the Nevada Supreme Court.See 107 Nev., at 181; 808 P. 2d, at 537 (describing medication
as "involuntary" and "forced"). Given the parties' positionson this point and the absence of any record evidence to the
contrary, we adhere to the understanding of the State Su-preme Court.

We also presume that administration of Mellaril was medi-cally appropriate. Although defense counsel stressed that
Riggins received a very high dose of the drug, at no pointdid he suggest to the Nevada courts that administration of
Mellaril was medically improper treatment for his client.Finally, the record is dispositive with respect to Riggins'
Eighth Amendment claim that administration of Mellaril de-nied him an opportunity to show jurors his true mental condition at the sentencing hearing. Because this argumentwas presented neither to the Nevada Supreme Court nor
in Riggins' petition for certiorari, we do not address it here.With these considerations in mind, we turn to Riggins'
core contention that involuntary administration of Mellarildenied him "a full and fair trial." Pet. for Cert. i. Our
discussion in Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210 (1990),provides useful background for evaluating this claim. In
Harper, a prison inmate alleged that the State of Washingtonand various individuals violated his right to due process by
giving him Mellaril and other antipsychotic drugs against hiswill. Although the inmate did not prevail, we agreed that

134 RIGGINS v. NEVADA

Opinion of the Court
his interest in avoiding involuntary administration of anti-psychotic drugs was protected under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. "The forcible injection ofmedication into a nonconsenting person's body," we said,
"represents a substantial interference with that person's liberty." Id., at 229. In the case of antipsychotic drugs likeMellaril, that interference is particularly severe:

"The purpose of the drugs is to alter the chemical balance in a patient's brain, leading to changes, intended tobe beneficial, in his or her cognitive processes. While

the therapeutic benefits of antipsychotic drugs are well
documented, it is also true that the drugs can have seri-ous, even fatal, side effects. One such side effect identified by the trial court is acute dystonia, a severe involun-tary spasm of the upper body, tongue, throat, or eyes.
The trial court found that it may be treated and re-versed within a few minutes through use of the medication Cogentin. Other side effects include akathesia
(motor restlessness, often characterized by an inabilityto sit still); neuroleptic malignant syndrome (a relatively

rare condition which can lead to death from cardiac dys-function); and tardive dyskinesia, perhaps the most discussed side effect of antipsychotic drugs. Tardive dys-kinesia is a neurological disorder, irreversible in some
cases, that is characterized by involuntary, uncontrolla-ble movements of various muscles, especially around the
face. . . . [T]he proportion of patients treated with antipsychotic drugs who exhibit the symptoms of tardivedyskinesia ranges from 10% to 25%. According to the

Opinion of the Court
mentally ill inmate to be treated involuntarily with antipsy-chotic drugs where there is a determination that "the inmate

is dangerous to himself or others and the treatment is in theinmate's medical interest."

Id., at 227.
Under Harper, forcing antipsychotic drugs on a convicted
prisoner is impermissible absent a finding of overridingjustification and a determination of medical appropriateness.

The Fourteenth Amendment affords at least as much pro-tection to persons the State detains for trial. See

Bell v.
Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 545 (1979) ("[P]retrial detainees, whohave not been convicted of any crimes, retain at least those

constitutional rights that we have held are enjoyed by convicted prisoners"); O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U. S. 342,
349 (1987) ("[P]rison regulations . . . are judged under a
`reasonableness' test less restrictive than that ordinarily applied to alleged infringements of fundamental constitutional
rights"). Thus, once Riggins moved to terminate administration of antipsychotic medication, the State became obligated to establish the need for Mellaril and the medical
appropriateness of the drug.

Although we have not had occasion to develop substantive
standards for judging forced administration of such drugs in
the trial or pretrial settings, Nevada certainly would have
satisfied due process if the prosecution had demonstrated,
and the District Court had found, that treatment with antipsychotic medication was medically appropriate and, considering less intrusive alternatives, essential for the sake of
Riggins' own safety or the safety of others. See Harper,
supra, at 225-226; cf. Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418
(1979) (Due Process Clause allows civil commitment of individuals shown by clear and convincing evidence to be mentally ill and dangerous). Similarly, the State might have
been able to justify medically appropriate, involuntary treatment with the drug by establishing that it could not obtain
an adjudication of Riggins' guilt or innocence by using less
intrusive means. See Illinois v. Allen, 397 U. S. 337, 347

136 RIGGINS v. NEVADA

Opinion of the Court
(1970) (Brennan, J., concurring) ("Constitutional power tobring an accused to trial is fundamental to a scheme of `ordered liberty' and prerequisite to social justice and peace").We note that during the July 14 hearing Riggins did not
contend that he had the right to be tried without Mellaril if
its discontinuation rendered him incompetent. See Record424-425, 496, 500. The question whether a competent criminal defendant may refuse antipsychotic medication if cessa-tion of medication would render him incompetent at trial is
not before us.Contrary to the dissent's understanding, we do not "adopt
a standard of strict scrutiny." Post, at 156. We have no
occasion to finally prescribe such substantive standards as
mentioned above, since the District Court allowed administration of Mellaril to continue without making any determination of the need for this course or any findings about
reasonable alternatives. The court's laconic order denying
Riggins' motion did not adopt the State's view, which was
that continued administration of Mellaril was required to ensure that the defendant could be tried; in fact, the hearing
testimony casts considerable doubt on that argument. See
supra, at 130-131. Nor did the order indicate a finding that
safety considerations or other compelling concerns outweighed Riggins' interest in freedom from unwanted antipsychotic drugs.

Were we to divine the District Court's logic from the hearing transcript, we would have to conclude that the court simply weighed the risk that the defense would be prejudiced
by changes in Riggins' outward appearance against the
chance that Riggins would become incompetent if taken off
Mellaril, and struck the balance in favor of involuntary medication. See Record 502 ("[T]hat he was nervous and so
forth . . . can all be brought out [through expert testimony].
And when you start weighing the consequences of taking
him off his medication and possibly have him revert into an
incompetent situation, I don't think that that is a good exper504us1$70L 04-10-96 12:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
iment"). The court did not acknowledge the defendant's lib-erty interest in freedom from unwanted antipsychotic drugs.

This error may well have impaired the constitutionallyprotected trial rights Riggins invokes. At the hearing to
consider terminating medication, Dr. O'Gorman suggested
that the dosage administered to Riggins was within the toxicrange,

id., at 483, and could make him "uptight," id., at 484.
Dr. Master testified that a patient taking 800 milligrams ofMellaril each day might suffer from drowsiness or confusion.

Id., at 416. Cf. Brief for American Psychiatric Associationas

Amicus Curiae 10-11 ("[I]n extreme cases, the sedationlike effect [of antipsychotic medication] may be severe
enough (akinesia) to affect thought processes"). It is clearly
possible that such side effects had an impact upon not just
Riggins' outward appearance, but also the content of his
testimony on direct or cross examination, his ability to follow the proceedings, or the substance of his communication
with counsel.

Efforts to prove or disprove actual prejudice from the record before us would be futile, and guesses whether the outcome of the trial might have been different if Riggins' motion
had been granted would be purely speculative. We accordingly reject the dissent's suggestion that Riggins should be
required to demonstrate how the trial would have proceeded
differently if he had not been given Mellaril. See post, at
149-150. Like the consequences of compelling a defendant
to wear prison clothing, see Estelle v. Williams, 425 U. S.
501, 504-505 (1976), or of binding and gagging an accused
during trial, see Allen, supra, at 344, the precise consequences of forcing antipsychotic medication upon Riggins
cannot be shown from a trial transcript. What the testimony of doctors who examined Riggins establishes, and what
we will not ignore, is a strong possibility that Riggins' defense was impaired due to the administration of Mellaril.

We also are persuaded that allowing Riggins to present
expert testimony about the effect of Mellaril on his de504us1$70L 04-10-96 12:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT
138 RIGGINS v. NEVADA

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
meanor did nothing to cure the possibility that the substanceof his own testimony, his interaction with counsel, or his comprehension at trial were compromised by forced administra-tion of Mellaril. Even if (as the dissent argues,

post, at
147-149) the Nevada Supreme Court was right that expert
testimony allowed jurors to assess Riggins' demeanor fairly,an unacceptable risk of prejudice remained. See 107 Nev.,

at 181, 808 P. 2d, at 537-538.To be sure, trial prejudice can sometimes be justified by
an essential state interest. See Holbrook v. Flynn, 475 U. S.560, 568-569 (1986);

Allen, supra, at 344 (binding and gagging the accused permissible only in extreme situationswhere it is the "fairest and most reasonable way" to control

a disruptive defendant); see also Williams, supra, at 505
(compelling defendants to wear prison clothing at trial furthers no essential state policy). Because the record contains
no finding that might support a conclusion that administration of antipsychotic medication was necessary to accomplish
an essential state policy, however, we have no basis for saying that the substantial probability of trial prejudice in this
case was justified.

The judgment of the Nevada Supreme Court is reversed,
and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Kennedy, concurring in the judgment.
The medical and pharmacological data in the amicus briefs
and other sources indicate that involuntary medication with
antipsychotic drugs poses a serious threat to a defendant's
right to a fair trial. In the case before us, there was no
hearing or well-developed record on the point, and the whole
subject of treating incompetence to stand trial by drug medication is somewhat new to the law, if not to medicine. On
the sparse record before us, we cannot give full consideration
to the issue. I file this separate opinion, however, to express

139Cite as: 504 U. S. 127 (1992)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
my view that absent an extraordinary showing by the State,the Due Process Clause prohibits prosecuting officials from

administering involuntary doses of antipsychotic medicinesfor purposes of rendering the accused competent for trial,
and to express doubt that the showing can be made in most
cases, given our present understanding of the properties ofthese drugs.

At the outset, I express full agreement with the Court'sconclusion that one who was medicated against his will in
order to stand trial may challenge his conviction. When theState commands medication during the pretrial and trial
phases of the case for the avowed purpose of changing the
defendant's behavior, the concerns are much the same as if it
were alleged that the prosecution had manipulated material
evidence. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, 87 (1963)
(suppression by the prosecution of material evidence favorable to the accused violates due process); Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U. S. 51, 58 (1988) (bad-faith failure to preserve
potentially useful evidence constitutes a due process violation). I cannot accept the premise of Justice Thomas' dissent that the involuntary medication order comprises some
separate procedure, unrelated to the trial and foreclosed
from inquiry or review in the criminal proceeding itself. To
the contrary, the allegations pertain to the State's interference with the trial. Thus, review in the criminal proceeding
is appropriate.

I also agree with the majority that the State has a legitimate interest in attempting to restore the competence of otherwise incompetent defendants. Its interest derives from
the State's right to bring an accused to trial and from our
holding in Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S. 375, 378 (1966), that
conviction of an incompetent defendant violates due process.
Unless a defendant is competent, the State cannot put him
on trial. Competence to stand trial is rudimentary, for upon
it depends the main part of those rights deemed essential to
a fair trial, including the right to effective assistance of coun504us1$70L 04-10-96 12:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
sel, the rights to summon, to confront, and to cross-examinewitnesses, and the right to testify on one's own behalf or to

remain silent without penalty for doing so. Drope v. Missouri, 420 U. S. 162, 171-172 (1975). Although the majority
is correct that this case does not require us to address the
question whether a defendant may waive his right to be triedwhile competent, in my view a general rule permitting

waiver would not withstand scrutiny under the Due ProcessClause, given our holdings in

Pate and Drope. A defendant's waiver of the right to be tried while competent wouldcast doubt on his exercise or waiver of all subsequent rights

and privileges through the whole course of the trial.

The question is whether the State's interest in conducting
the trial allows it to ensure the defendant's competence by
involuntary medication, assuming of course there is a sound
medical basis for the treatment. The Court's opinion will
require further proceedings on remand, but there seems to
be little discussion about what is to be considered. The
Court's failure to address these issues is understandable in
some respects, for it was not the subject of briefing or argument; but to underscore my reservations about the propriety
of involuntary medication for the purpose of rendering the
defendant competent, and to explain what I think ought to
be express qualifications of the Court's opinion, some discussion of the point is required.

This is not a case like Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210
(1990), in which the purpose of the involuntary medication
was to ensure that the incarcerated person ceased to be a
physical danger to himself or others. The inquiry in that
context is both objective and manageable. Here the purpose
of the medication is not merely to treat a person with grave
psychiatric disorders and enable that person to function and
behave in a way not dangerous to himself or others, but
rather to render the person competent to stand trial. It is
the last part of the State's objective, medicating the person
for the purpose of bringing him to trial, that causes most

141Cite as: 504 U. S. 127 (1992)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
serious concern. If the only question were whether some
bare level of functional competence can be induced, that
would be a grave matter in itself, but here there are even
more far reaching concerns. The avowed purpose of the
medication is not functional competence, but competence to
stand trial. In my view elementary protections against
state intrusion require the State in every case to make a
showing that there is no significant risk that the medication
will impair or alter in any material way the defendant's capacity or willingness to react to the testimony at trial or to
assist his counsel. Based on my understanding of the medical literature, I have substantial reservations that the State
can make that showing. Indeed, the inquiry itself is elusive,
for it assumes some baseline of normality that experts may
have some difficulty in establishing for a particular defendant, if they can establish it at all. These uncertainties serve
to underscore the difficult terrain the State must traverse
when it enters this domain.

To make these concerns concrete, the effects of antipsychotic drugs must be addressed. First introduced in the
1950's, antipsychotic drugs such as Mellaril have wide acceptance in the psychiatric community as an effective treatment
for psychotic thought disorders. See American Psychiatric
Press Textbook of Psychiatry 770-774 (J. Talbott, R. Hales, &
S. Yodofsky eds. 1988) (Textbook of Psychiatry); Brief for
American Psychiatric Association as Amicus Curiae 6-7.
The medications restore normal thought processes by clearing hallucinations and delusions. Textbook of Psychiatry
774. See also Brief for American Psychiatric Association as
Amicus Curiae 9 ("The mental health produced by antipsychotic medication is no different from, no more inauthentic
or alien to the patient than, the physical health produced by
other medications, such as penicillin for pneumonia"). For
many patients, no effective alternative exists for treatment
of their illnesses. Id., at 7, and n. 3.

142 RIGGINS v. NEVADA

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
Although these drugs have changed the lives of psychiatricpatients, they can have unwanted side effects. We documented some of the more serious side effects in Washingtonv.

Harper, supra, at 229-230, and they are mentioned again
in the majority opinion. More relevant to this case are side
effects that, it appears, can compromise the right of a medi-cated criminal defendant to receive a fair trial. The drugs

can prejudice the accused in two principal ways: (1) by alter-ing his demeanor in a manner that will prejudice his reactions and presentation in the courtroom, and (2) by renderinghim unable or unwilling to assist counsel.

It is a fundamental assumption of the adversary system
that the trier of fact observes the accused throughout the
trial, while the accused is either on the stand or sitting at
the defense table. This assumption derives from the right
to be present at trial, which in turn derives from the right
to testify and rights under the Confrontation Clause. Taylor v. United States, 414 U. S. 17, 19 (1973) (per curiam).
At all stages of the proceedings, the defendant's behavior,
manner, facial expressions, and emotional responses, or their
absence, combine to make an overall impression on the trier
of fact, an impression that can have a powerful influence on
the outcome of the trial. If the defendant takes the stand,
as Riggins did, his demeanor can have a great bearing on his
credibility and persuasiveness, and on the degree to which
he evokes sympathy. The defendant's demeanor may also
be relevant to his confrontation rights. See Coy v. Iowa,
487 U. S. 1012, 1016-1020 (1988) (emphasizing the importance
of the face-to-face encounter between the accused and the
accuser).

The side effects of antipsychotic drugs may alter demeanor
in a way that will prejudice all facets of the defense. Serious due process concerns are implicated when the State manipulates the evidence in this way. The defendant may be
restless and unable to sit still. Brief for American Psychiatric Association as Amicus Curiae 10. The drugs can induce

a condition called parkinsonism, which, like Parkinson's dis-ease, is characterized by tremor of the limbs, diminished

range of facial expression, or slowed functions, such asspeech.

Ibid. Some of the side effects are more subtle.
Antipsychotic drugs such as Mellaril can have a "sedationlike effect" that in severe cases may affect thought processes.
Ibid. At trial, Dr. Jurasky testified that Mellaril has "a
tranquilizer effect." Record 752. See also ibid. ("If youare dealing with someone very sick then you may prescribe

up to 800 milligrams which is the dose he had been takingwhich is very, very high. I mean you can tranquilize an
elephant with 800 milligrams"). Dr. Jurasky listed thefollowing side effects of large doses of Mellaril: "Drowsiness, constipation, perhaps lack of alertness, changes in blood
pressure. . . . Depression of the psychomotor functions. Ifyou take a lot of it you become stoned for all practical

purposes and can barely function." Id., at 753.These potential side effects would be disturbing for any
patient; but when the patient is a criminal defendant who isgoing to stand trial, the documented probability of side effects seems to me to render involuntary administration ofthe drugs by prosecuting officials unacceptable absent a
showing by the State that the side effects will not alter the
defendant's reactions or diminish his capacity to assist coun-sel. As the American Psychiatric Association points out:

"By administering medication, the State may be creating a prejudicial negative demeanor in the defendant--
making him look nervous and restless, for example, orso calm or sedated as to appear bored, cold, unfeeling,

and unresponsive. . . . That such effects may be subtle
does not make them any less real or potentially influential." Brief for American Psychiatric Association as
Amicus Curiae 13.

As any trial attorney will attest, serious prejudice could
result if medication inhibits the defendant's capacity to react

144 RIGGINS v. NEVADA

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
and respond to the proceedings and to demonstrate remorseor compassion. The prejudice can be acute during the sentencing phase of the proceedings, when the sentencer mustattempt to know the heart and mind of the offender and
judge his character, his contrition or its absence, and his future dangerousness. In a capital sentencing proceeding, as-sessments of character and remorse may carry great weight

and, perhaps, be determinative of whether the offender livesor dies. See Geimer & Amsterdam, Why Jurors Vote Life
or Death: Operative Factors in Ten Florida Death PenaltyCases, 15 Am. J. Crim. L. 1, 51-53 (1987-1988).

Concerns about medication extend also to the issue of
cooperation with counsel. We have held that a defendant's
right to the effective assistance of counsel is impaired when
he cannot cooperate in an active manner with his lawyer.
Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201 (1964); Geders v.
United States, 425 U. S. 80 (1976) (trial court order directing
defendant not to consult with his lawyer during an overnight
recess held to deprive him of the effective assistance of counsel). The defendant must be able to provide needed information to his lawyer and to participate in the making of decisions on his own behalf. The side effects of antipsychotic
drugs can hamper the attorney-client relation, preventing effective communication and rendering the defendant less able
or willing to take part in his defense. The State interferes
with this relation when it administers a drug to dull cognition. See Brief for National Association of Criminal
Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 42 ("[T]he chemical
flattening of a person's will can also lead to the defendant's
loss of self-determination undermining the desire for selfpreservation which is necessary to engage the defendant in
his own defense in preparation for his trial").

It is well established that the defendant has the right to
testify on his own behalf, a right we have found essential to
our adversary system. In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257, 273
(1948). We have found the right implicit as well in the Com504us1$70L 04-10-96 12:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT

145Cite as: 504 U. S. 127 (1992)

pulsory Process Clause of the Sixth Amendment. Rock v.
Arkansas, 483 U. S. 44 (1987). In Rock, we held that a state
rule excluding all testimony aided or refreshed by hypnosisviolated the defendant's constitutional right to take the stand

in her own defense. We observed that barring the testimony would contradict not only the right of the accused toconduct her own defense, but also her right to make this

defense in person: " `It is the accused, not counsel, who mustbe "informed of the nature and cause of the accusation," who
must be "confronted with the witnesses against him," andwho must be accorded "compulsory process for obtaining
witnesses in his favor." ' " Id., at 52, quoting Faretta v. California, 422 U. S. 806, 819 (1975). We gave further recognition to the right of the accused to testify in his or her own
words, and noted that this in turn was related to the Fifth
Amendment choice to speak "in the unfettered exercise of
his own will." Rock, supra, at 53. In my view medication
of the type here prescribed may be for the very purpose of
imposing constraints on the defendant's own will, and for
that reason its legitimacy is put in grave doubt.

If the State cannot render the defendant competent without involuntary medication, then it must resort to civil commitment, if appropriate, unless the defendant becomes competent through other means. If the defendant cannot be
tried without his behavior and demeanor being affected in
this substantial way by involuntary treatment, in my view
the Constitution requires that society bear this cost in order
to preserve the integrity of the trial process. The state of
our knowledge of antipsychotic drugs and their side effects
is evolving and may one day produce effective drugs that
have only minimal side effects. Until that day comes, we
can permit their use only when the State can show that involuntary treatment does not cause alterations raising the concerns enumerated in this separate opinion.

With these observations, I concur in the judgment reversing the conviction.

146 RIGGINS v. NEVADA

Thomas, J., dissenting
Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins except as to Part II-A, dissenting.

Petitioner David Edward Riggins killed Paul William
Wade by stabbing him 32 times with a knife. He then took
cash, drugs, and other items from Wade's home. A Nevada
jury convicted Riggins of first-degree murder and robbery
with a deadly weapon and sentenced him to death. The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed. 107 Nev. 178, 808 P. 2d 535
(1991). This Court reverses the conviction, holding that Nevada unconstitutionally deprived Riggins of his liberty interest in avoiding unwanted medication by compelling him to
take an antipsychotic drug. I respectfully dissent.

The Court's opinion, in my view, conflates two distinct
questions: whether Riggins had a full and fair criminal trial
and whether Nevada improperly forced Riggins to take medication. In this criminal case, Riggins is asking, and may
ask, only for the reversal of his conviction and sentence. He
is not seeking, and may not seek, an injunction to terminate
his medical treatment or damages for an infringement of his
personal rights. I agree with the positions of the majority
and concurring opinions in the Nevada Supreme Court: Even
if the State truly forced Riggins to take medication, and even
if this medication deprived Riggins of a protected liberty
interest in a manner actionable in a different legal proceeding, Riggins nonetheless had the fundamentally fair criminal
trial required by the Constitution. I therefore would affirm
his conviction.

I

Riggins contended in the Nevada Supreme Court that he
did not have a " `full and fair' trial" for two reasons, the first
relating to exclusion of evidence of his mental condition and
the second concerning his ability to assist in his defense.
Record 1018. To the extent that Riggins' arguments below
involved federal constitutional issues, I believe that the
Nevada Supreme Court correctly rejected them.

Thomas, J., dissenting

A
Riggins first argued that the trial court improperly pre-vented him from presenting relevant evidence of his demeanor. As the Court notes, Riggins suffers from a mentalillness and raised insanity as a defense at trial. When Riggins killed Wade, he was not using any antipsychotic medica-tion. During his trial, however, Riggins was taking large
doses of the antipsychotic drug Mellaril. Riggins believedthat this drug would make his appearance at trial different
from his appearance when he attacked Wade and that thisdifference might cause the jury to misjudge his sanity. To
show his mental condition as it existed at the time of thecrime, Riggins requested permission to appear before the
jury in an unmedicated state. App. 20-24, 42-47. The trialcourt denied the request, and the Nevada Supreme Court
affirmed.This Court has no power to decide questions concerning
the admissibility of evidence under Nevada law. Estelle v.
McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 67-68 (1991). We therefore may con-duct only a limited review of a Nevada court's decision to

exclude a particular form of demeanor evidence. Except incases involving a violation of a specific constitutional provision such as the Confrontation Clause, see, e. g., Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980), this Court may not reverse a state"trial judge's action in the admission of evidence" unless the

evidentiary ruling "so infuse[s] the trial with unfairness asto deny due process of law." Lisenba v. California, 314
U. S. 219, 228 (1941). See also Marshall v. Lonberger, 459U. S. 422, 438, n. 6 (1983); Burgett v. Texas, 389 U. S. 109,
113-114 (1967). In this case, I see no basis for concludingthat Riggins had less than a full and fair trial.

The Court declines to decide whether Mellaril actually af-fected Riggins' appearance. On the basis of some pretrial
psychiatric testimony it speculates only that Riggins mighthave looked less uptight, drowsy, or confused if he had not
taken the drug. Ante, at 137. Other evidence casts doubt

504us1$70L 04-10-96 12:46:28 PAGES OPINPGT
148 RIGGINS v. NEVADA

Thomas, J., dissenting
on this possibility. At least one psychiatrist believed that ajury would not "be able to notice whether or not [Riggins]

was on Mellaril as compared to the period of the time whenhe was not medicated by that drug." Record 445. Yet,
even if Mellaril noticeably affected Riggins' demeanor, the
Court fails to explain why the medication's effects renderedRiggins' trial fundamentally unfair.

The trial court offered Riggins the opportunity to provehis mental condition as it existed at the time of the crime
through testimony instead of his appearance in court in anunmedicated condition. Riggins took advantage of this offer
by explaining to the jury the history of his mental health,
his usage of Mellaril, and the possible effects of Mellaril on
his demeanor. Id., at 739-740. Riggins also called Dr. Jack
A. Jurasky, a psychiatrist, who testified about Riggins' condition after his arrest and his likely mental state at the time
of the crime. Id., at 747-748. Dr. Jurasky also explained
Riggins' use of Mellaril and how it might be affecting him.
Id., at 752-753, 760-761.

The Nevada Supreme Court concluded that this "testimony was sufficient to inform the jury of the effect of the
Mellaril on Riggins' demeanor and testimony." 107 Nev., at
181, 808 P. 2d, at 538. Its analysis comports with that of
other state courts that also have held that expert testimony
may suffice to clarify the effects of an antipsychotic drug on
a defendant's apparent demeanor. See State v. Law, 270
S. C. 664, 673, 244 S. E. 2d 302, 306 (1978); State v. Jojola, 89
N. M. 489, 493, 553 P. 2d 1296, 1300 (1976). Cf. In re Pray,

conviction because no expert testimony explained how antipsychotic medicine affected the defendant's appearance).
Having reviewed the record as a whole, I see no reason
to disturb the conclusion of the Nevada Supreme Court.
On the facts of this case, Riggins' inability to introduce evidence of his mental condition as he desired did not render
his trial fundamentally unfair. See Rock v. Arkansas, 483

Riggins also argued in the Nevada Supreme Court, al-though not in his briefs to this Court, that he did not have a

" `full and fair' trial" because Mellaril had side effects thatinterfered with his ability to participate in his defense. Record 1018. He alleged, in particular, that the drug tendedto limit his powers of perception. The Court accepts this
contention, stating: "It is clearly possible that such side ef-fects had an impact upon . . . the content of his testimony on
direct or cross examination, his ability to follow the proceed-ings, or the substance of his communication with counsel."
Ante, at 137 (emphasis added). I disagree. We cannot con-clude that Riggins had less than a full and fair trial merely
because of the possibility that Mellaril had side effects.All criminal defendants have a right to a full and fair trial,
and a violation of this right may occur if a State tries a de-fendant who lacks a certain ability to comprehend or participate in the proceedings. We have said that "the Due Proc-ess Clause guarantees the fundamental elements of fairness
in a criminal trial," Spencer v. Texas, 385 U. S. 554, 563-564(1967), and have made clear that "conviction of an accused
person while he is legally incompetent violates due process,"Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S. 375, 378 (1966).

Riggins has no claim of legal incompetence in this case.The trial court specifically found him competent while he
was taking Mellaril under a statute requiring him to have"sufficient mentality to be able to understand the nature of
the criminal charges against him, and . . . to aid and assisthis counsel in the defense interposed upon the trial." Nev.
Rev. Stat. $ 178.400(2) (1989). Riggins does not assert thatdue process imposes a higher standard.

The record does not reveal any other form of unfairnessrelating to the purported side effects of Mellaril. Riggins
has failed to allege specific facts to support his claim that he

Thomas, J., dissenting
could not participate effectively in his defense. He has notstated how he would have directed his counsel to examine or

cross-examine witnesses differently. He has not identifiedany testimony or instructions that he did not understand.
The record, moreover, does not even support his assertionthat Mellaril made him worse off. As Justice Rose noted in
his concurring opinion below: "Two psychiatrists who hadprescribed Mellaril for Riggins, Dr. Quass and Dr. O'Gorman,
testified that they believed it was helpful to him. Additionalpsychiatric testimony established that Mellaril may have increased Riggins' cognitive ability . . . ." 107 Nev., at 185,808 P. 2d, at 540. See also

State v. Hayes, 118 N. H. 458, 461,389 A. 2d 1379, 1381 (1978) (holding a defendant's perception

adequate because "[a]ll the expert evidence support[ed] theconclusion that the medication ha[d] a beneficial effect on
the defendant's ability to function").1 Riggins' competence,moreover, tends to confirm that he had a fair trial. See
State v. Jojola, supra, at 492, 553 P. 2d, at 1299 (presuming,absent other evidence, that the side effects of an antipsychotic drug did not render a competent defendant unable toparticipate fully in his trial). I thus see no basis for reversing the Nevada Supreme Court.

II
Riggins also argues for reversal on the basis of our holdingin Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210, 221 (1990), that the

Due Process Clause protects a substantive "liberty interest"in avoiding unwanted medication. Riggins asserts that Nevada unconstitutionally deprived him of this liberty interestby forcing him to take Mellaril. The Court agrees, ruling

that "the Nevada courts failed to make findings sufficient tosupport forced administration of the drug" in this case.

Ante, at 129. I consider reversal on this basis improper.

A
Riggins may not complain about a deprivation of the lib-erty interest that we recognized in Harper because the record does not support his version of the facts. Shortly afterhis arrest, as the Court notes, Riggins told a psychiatrist at
his jail that he was hearing voices and could not sleep. Thepsychiatrist prescribed Mellaril. When the prescription did
not eliminate the problem, Riggins sought further treatmentand the psychiatrist increased the dosage. Riggins thus
began taking the drug voluntarily. Ante, at 129.The Court concludes that the medication became involuntary when the trial court denied Riggins' motion for permis-sion not to take the drug during the trial.

Ante, at 133. Idisagree. Although the court denied Riggins' motion, it did

not order him to take any medication.2 Moreover, eventhough Riggins alleges that the state physicians forced him
to take the medication after the court's order, the recordcontains no finding of fact with respect to this allegation.
The Court admits that it merely assumes that the physiciansdrugged him, and attempts to justify its assumption by observing that the Nevada Supreme Court also assumed thatinvoluntary medication occurred.

Ibid. The Nevada Su-preme Court, however, may have made its assumption for

the purpose of argument; the assumption, in its view, did

argument:

"QUESTION: . . . [D]id the court ever go further than saying I will not
order the State to stop administering the medication? . . . It simply said
. . . I won't intervene and enjoin the administration of this medication[.]

"MR. YAMPOLSKY: Yes . . . .
"QUESTION: So if [Riggins] had then said, well, I'm not going to take
it, he wouldn't be in violation of the court order? . . .

not change the result of the case. The Court cannot makethe same assumption if it requires reversal of Riggins'

conviction.Riggins also cannot complain about a violation of Harper
because he did not argue below for reversal of his convictionon the ground that Nevada had deprived him of a liberty
interest. Riggins consistently maintained in the Nevadacourts that he did not have a "full and fair trial" because the
medication deprived him of the opportunity to present hisdemeanor to the jury and to participate in his defense. App.
20-24 (trial court motion); id., at 42-47 (trial court reply);Record 1018-1021 (appellate brief);

id., at 1068-1071 (appel-late reply brief). As counsel for Nevada put it at oral argument: "The way this issue was initially presented to the trialcourt was really a question of trial strategy. There was
never an indication in this case that Mr. Riggins was aHarper-type defendant who did not want to be medicated."
Tr. of Oral Arg. 23.3Because the claims that Riggins raised below have no
merit, Riggins has altered his theory of the case. TheCourt, therefore, should not condemn the Nevada courts
because they "did not acknowledge the defendant's libertyinterest in freedom from unwanted antipsychotic drugs."
Ante, at 137. The Nevada courts had no reason to consideran argument that Riggins did not make. We have said quite
recently that "[i]n reviewing the judgments of state courtsunder the jurisdictional grant of 28 U. S. C. $ 1257, the Court
has, with very rare exceptions, refused to consider petition3 Riggins noted in his reply brief before the Nevada Supreme Court that
the courts in United States v. Bryant, 670 F. Supp. 840, 843 (Minn. 1987),
and Bee v. Greaves, 744 F. 2d 1387 (CA10 1984), had recognized a personal
liberty interest in avoiding unwanted medication. Record 1070-1071.
Yet, Riggins never asked for reversal because of a deprivation of this
interest. He argued for reversal in that brief only on grounds that the
medication "violated [his] right to a `full and fair' trial because it denied
him the ability to assist in his defense, and prejudiced his demeanor, attitude, and appearance to the jury." Id., at 1068.

ers' claims that were not raised or addressed below." Yee v.Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 533 (1992). Although "we have

expressed inconsistent views as to whether this rule is juris-dictional or prudential in cases arising from state courts,"
ibid., the Court does not attempt to justify its departurehere.

Finally, we did not grant certiorari to determine whetherthe Nevada courts had made the findings required by

Harperto support forced administration of a drug. We took this

case to decide "[w]hether forced medication during trial vio-lates a defendant's constitutional right to a full and fair
trial." Pet. for Cert. The Court declines to answer thisquestion one way or the other, stating only that a violation
of Harper "may well have impaired the constitutionally pro-tected trial rights Riggins invokes."

Ante, at 137. As wehave stated, "we ordinarily do not consider questions outside

those presented in the petition for certiorari." Yee v. Es-condido, supra, at 535. I believe that we should refuse to
consider Riggins' Harper argument.

B
The Harper issue, in any event, does not warrant rever-sal of Riggins' conviction. The Court correctly states that

Riggins, as a detainee awaiting trial, had at least the sameliberty interest in avoiding unwanted medication that the
inmate had in Harper. This case, however, differs fromHarper in a very significant respect. When the inmate in
Harper complained that physicians were drugging himagainst his will, he sought damages and an injunction against
future medication in a civil action under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983.See 494 U. S., at 217. Although Riggins also complains of
forced medication, he is seeking a reversal of his criminalconviction. I would not expand

Harper to include thisremedy.

We have held that plaintiffs may receive civil remediesfor all manner of constitutional violations under $ 1983. See

154 RIGGINS v. NEVADA

Thomas, J., dissenting
Dennis v. Higgins, 498 U. S. 439, 443-451 (1991). This
Court, however, has reversed criminal convictions only on
the basis of two kinds of constitutional deprivations: those
"which occu[r] during the presentation of the case" to the
trier of fact, and those which cause a "structural defect affecting the framework" of the trial. Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 307, 310 (1991). The Court does not
reveal why it considers a deprivation of a liberty interest in
avoiding unwanted medication to fall into either category of
reversible error. Even if Nevada failed to make the findings
necessary to support forced administration of Mellaril, this
failure, without more, would not constitute a trial error or a
flaw in the trial mechanism. See 107 Nev., at 185, 808 P. 2d,
at 540 (Rose, J., concurring). Although Riggins might be
entitled to other remedies, he has no right to have his conviction reversed.4

4 A State, however, might violate a defendant's due process right to a
fundamentally fair trial if its administration of medication were to diminish substantially the defendant's mental faculties during the trial, even if
he were not thereby rendered incompetent. See 3 E. Coke, Institutes *34
(1797) ("If felons come in judgement to answer, . . . they shall be out of
irons, and all manner of bonds, so that their pain shall not take away any
manner of reason, nor them constrain to answer, but at their free will");
Resolutions of the Judges upon the Case of the Regicides, Kelyng's Report
of Divers Cases in Pleas of the Crown 10 (1708) (Old Bailey 1660) ("It was
resolved that when Prisoners come to the Bar to be tryed, their Irons
ought to be taken off, so that they be not in any Torture while they make
their defense, be their Crime never so great"), reprinted in 5 How. St. Tr.
971, 979-980 (1816); Trial of Christopher Layer, 16 How. St. Tr. 94, 100
(1812) [K. B. 1722] ("[T]he authority is that [the defendant] is not to be `in
vinculis' during his trial, but should be so far free, that he should have the
use of his reason, and all advantages to clear his innocence"); see also State
v. Williams, 18 Wash. 47, 49-51, 50 P. 580, 581 (1897) (" `[T]he condition of
the prisoner in shackles may, to some extent, deprive him of the free and
calm use of all his faculties' ") (quoting State v. Kring, 64 Mo. 591 (1877)).
Riggins has not made (much less proved) any such allegation in this Court;
indeed, the record indicates that Riggins' mental capacity was enhanced
by his administration of Mellaril.

Thomas, J., dissenting
We applied a similar analysis in Estelle v. Williams, 425U. S. 501 (1976). In that case, a prisoner challenged his conviction on grounds that the State had required him to wearprison garb before the jury. In reviewing the challenge, we
did not ask whether the State had violated some personal
right of the defendant to select his attire. Instead, we con-sidered only whether the prison clothing had denied him a

"fair trial" by making his appearance less favorable to thejury.

Id., at 503. Although we ultimately declined to reach
the merits because the prisoner had waived the issue at trial,
id., at 512, we observed that lower courts had held that "a
showing of actual prejudice must be made by a defendant
seeking to have his conviction overturned on this ground,"
id., at 504, n. 1. In my view, just as the validity of the conviction in Estelle v. Williams would depend on whether the
prisoner had a fair trial, so does the validity of Riggins'
conviction.

The need for requiring actual unfairness in this case
(either in the form of a structural defect or an error in the
presentation of evidence) becomes apparent when one considers how the Court might apply its decision to other cases.
A State could violate Harper by forcibly administering any
kind of medication to a criminal defendant. Yet, the Court
surely would not reverse a criminal conviction for a Harper
violation involving medications such as penicillin or aspirin.
Perhaps Mellaril, in general, has a greater likelihood of affecting a person's appearance and powers of perceptions than
these substances. As noted above, however, we have no indication in this case, considering the record as a whole, that
Mellaril unfairly prejudiced Riggins.

I do not mean in any way to undervalue the importance of
a person's liberty interest in avoiding forced medication or
to suggest that States may drug detainees at their whim.
Under Harper, detainees have an interest in avoiding unwanted medication that the States must respect. In appropriate instances, detainees may seek damages or injunctions

against further medication in civil actions either under$ 1983, as in Harper, or under state law. Yet, when this

Court reviews a state-court criminal conviction of a defend-ant who has taken medication, it cannot undo any violation
that already has occurred or punish those responsible. Itmay determine only whether the defendant received a
proper trial, free of the kinds of reversible errors that wehave recognized. Because Riggins had a full and fair trial
in this case, I would affirm the Nevada Supreme Court.

C
For the foregoing reasons, I find it unnecessary to addressthe precise standards governing the forced administration of

drugs to persons such as Riggins. Whether or not Nevadaviolated these standards, I would affirm Riggins' conviction.
I note, however, that the Court's discussion of these stand-ards poses troubling questions. Although the Court purports to rely on Washington v. Harper, the standards that itapplies in this case differ in several respects.

The Court today, for instance, appears to adopt a standardof strict scrutiny. It specifically faults the trial court for
failing to find either that the "continued administration ofMellaril was

required to ensure that the defendant could betried,"
ante, at 136 (emphasis added), or that "other compel-ling concerns outweighed Riggins' interest in freedom from

unwanted antipsychotic drugs," ibid. (emphasis added).We specifically rejected this high standard of review in
Harper. In that case, the Washington Supreme Court hadheld that state physicians could not administer medication
to a prisoner without showing that it "was both necessaryand effective for furthering a compelling state interest."
494 U. S., at 218. We reversed, holding that the state court"erred in refusing to apply the standard of reasonableness."
Id., at 223.The Court today also departs from

Harper when it saysthat the Nevada Supreme Court erred by not "considering

less intrusive alternatives." Ante, at 135. The Court pre-sumably believes that Nevada could have treated Riggins

with smaller doses of Mellaril or with other kinds of thera-pies. In Harper, however, we imposed no such requirement.
In fact, we specifically ruled that "[t]he alternative meansproffered by [the prisoner] for accommodating his interest in
rejecting the forced administration of antipsychotic drugs donot demonstrate the invalidity of the State's policy." 494
U. S., at 226.This case differs from

Harper because it involves a pretrialdetainee and not a convicted prisoner. The standards for

forcibly medicating inmates well may differ from those forpersons awaiting trial. The Court, however, does not rely
on this distinction in departing from Harper; instead, it pur-ports to be applying

Harper to detainees. Ante, at 135.Either the Court is seeking to change the Harper standards

or it is adopting different standards for detainees withoutstating its reasons. I cannot accept either interpretation of
the Court's opinion. For all of these reasons, I respectfullydissent.

Syllabus

WYATT v. COLE et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 91-126. Argued January 14, 1992--Decided May 18, 1992
With the assistance of respondent Robbins, an attorney, respondent Cole

filed a complaint under the Mississippi replevin statute against his partner, petitioner Wyatt. After Cole refused to comply with a state court
order to return to Wyatt property seized under the statute, Wyatt
brought suit in the Federal District Court under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, challenging the state statute's constitutionality and seeking injunctive relief
and damages. Among other things, the court held the statute unconstitutional and assumed that Cole was subject to liability under Lugar
v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922, in which this Court ruled that private defendants invoking state replevin, garnishment, and attachment
statutes later declared unconstitutional act under color of state law
for $ 1983 liability purposes. The court also intimated that, but did
not decide whether, Robbins was subject to $ 1983 liability. However,
Lugar had left open the question whether private defendants are entitled to qualified immunity from suit in such cases, see id., at 942, n. 23,
and the District Court held that respondents were entitled to qualified
immunity at least for conduct arising prior to the replevin statute's
invalidation. The Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of qualified immunity to respondents without revisiting the question of their $ 1983
liability.

Held:

1. Qualified immunity from suit, as enunciated by this Court with
respect to government officials, is not available to private defendants
charged with $ 1983 liability for invoking state replevin, garnishment,
or attachment statutes. Immunity for private defendants was not so
firmly rooted in the common law and was not supported by such strong
policy reasons as to create an inference that Congress meant to incorporate it into $ 1983. See, e. g., Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U. S.
622, 637. Even if there were sufficient common law support to conclude that private defendants should be entitled to a good faith and/or
probable cause defense to suits for unjustified harm arising out of the
misuse of governmental processes, that would still not entitle respondents to what they obtained in the courts below: the type of objectively
determined, immediately appealable, qualified immunity from suit accorded government officials under, e. g., Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S.

Opinion of the Court
800, and Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511. Moreover, the policy concerns mandating qualified immunity for officials in such cases--the need
to preserve the officials' ability to perform their discretionary functions
and to ensure that talented candidates not be deterred by the threat
of damages suits from entering public service--are not applicable to
private parties. Although it may be that private defendants faced
with $ 1983 liability under Lugar, supra, could be entitled to an affirmative good faith defense, or that $ 1983 suits against private, rather
than governmental, parties could require plaintiffs to carry additional
burdens, those issues are neither before the Court nor decided here.
Pp. 163-169.

2. On remand, it must be determined, at least, whether respondents,
in invoking the replevin statute, acted under color of state law within
the meaning of Lugar, supra. P. 169.

In Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922 (1982), weleft open the question whether private defendants charged

I
This dispute arises out of a soured cattle partnership. InJuly 1986, respondent Bill Cole sought to dissolve his partnership with petitioner Howard Wyatt. When no agree-ment could be reached, Cole, with the assistance of an

Opinion of the Court
attorney, respondent John Robbins II, filed a state court
complaint in replevin against Wyatt, accompanied by a replevin bond of $18,000.

At that time, Mississippi law provided that an individual
could obtain a court order for seizure of property possessed
by another by posting a bond and swearing to a state court
that the applicant was entitled to that property and that the
adversary "wrongfully took and detain[ed] or wrongfully detain[ed]" the property. 1975 Miss. Gen. Laws, ch. 508, $ 1.
The statute gave the judge no discretion to deny a writ of
replevin.

After Cole presented a complaint and bond, the court ordered the county sheriff to seize 24 head of cattle, a tractor,
and certain other personal property from Wyatt. Several
months later, after a postseizure hearing, the court dismissed
Cole's complaint in replevin and ordered the property returned to Wyatt. When Cole refused to comply, Wyatt
brought suit in Federal District Court, challenging the constitutionality of the statute and seeking injunctive relief and
damages from respondents, the county sheriff, and the deputies involved in the seizure.

The District Court held that the statute's failure to afford
judges discretion to deny writs of replevin violated due process. 710 F. Supp. 180, 183 (SD Miss. 1989).1 It dismissed
the suit against the government officials involved in the seizure on the ground that they were entitled to qualified immunity. App. 17-18. The court also held that Cole and Robbins, even if otherwise liable under $ 1983, were entitled to
qualified immunity from suit for conduct arising prior to the
statute's invalidation. Id., at 12-14. The Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the District Court's grant of
qualified immunity to the private defendants. 928 F. 2d

Opinion of the Court
We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 807 (1991), to resolve aconflict among the Courts of Appeals over whether private

defendants threatened with 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 liability are,like certain government officials, entitled to qualified immunity from suit. Like the Fifth Circuit, the Eighth and Elev-enth Circuits have determined that private defendants are
entitled to qualified immunity. See Buller v. Buechler, 706F. 2d 844, 850-852 (CA8 1983);

Jones v. Preuit & Mauldin,851 F. 2d 1321, 1323-1325 (CA11 1988) (en banc), vacated on

other grounds, 489 U. S. 1002 (1989). The First and NinthCircuits, however, have held that in certain circumstances,
private parties acting under color of state law are not enti-tled to such an immunity. See

Downs v. Sawtelle, 574 F. 2d1, 15-16 (CA1), cert. denied, 439 U. S. 910 (1978); Conner v.

Santa Ana, 897 F. 2d 1487, 1492, n. 9 (CA9), cert. denied, 498U. S. 816 (1990); Howerton v. Gabica, 708 F. 2d 380, 385, n. 10
(CA9 1983). The Sixth Circuit has rejected qualified immu-nity for private defendants sued under $ 1983 but has established a good faith defense. Duncan v. Peck, 844 F. 2d1261 (1988).

II
Title 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 provides a cause of action against"[e]very person who, under color of any statute . . . of any

State . . . subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen . . .to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities
secured by the Constitution and laws . . . ." The purpose of$ 1983 is to deter state actors from using the badge of their
authority to deprive individuals of their federally guaranteedrights and to provide relief to victims if such deterrence fails.
Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 254-257 (1978).In

Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., supra, the Court consid-ered the scope of $ 1983 liability in the context of garnishment, prejudgment attachment, and replevin statutes. Inthat case, the Court held that private parties who attached
a debtor's assets pursuant to a state attachment statute weresubject to $ 1983 liability if the statute was constitutionally

162 WYATT v. COLE

Opinion of the Court
infirm. Noting that our garnishment, prejudgment attachment, and replevin cases established that private use of state
laws to secure property could constitute "state action" for
purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, id., at 932-935, the
Court held that private defendants invoking a state-created
attachment statute act "under color of state law" within the
meaning of $ 1983 if their actions are "fairly attributable to
the State," id., at 937. This requirement is satisfied, the
Court held, if two conditions are met. First, the "deprivation must be caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the State or by a rule of conduct imposed by
the State or by a person for whom the State is responsible."
Ibid. Second, the private party must have "acted together
with or . . . obtained significant aid from state officials" or
engaged in conduct "otherwise chargeable to the State."
Ibid. The Court found potential $ 1983 liability in Lugar because the attachment scheme was created by the State and
because the private defendants, in invoking the aid of state
officials to attach the disputed property, were "willful participant[s] in joint activity with the State or its agents." Id.,
at 941 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Citing Lugar, the District Court assumed that Cole, by
invoking the state statute, had acted under color of state law
within the meaning of $ 1983, and was therefore liable for
damages for the deprivation of Wyatt's due process rights.
App. 12. With respect to Robbins, the court noted that
while an action taken by an attorney in representing a client

Robbins was liable, however, because it held that both Cole
and Robbins were entitled to qualified immunity from suit
at least for conduct prior to the statute's invalidation. Id.,

Opinion of the Court
Although the Court of Appeals did not review whether, inthe first instance, Cole and Robbins had acted under color of

state law within the meaning of $ 1983, it affirmed the Dis-trict Court's grant of qualified immunity to respondents. In
so doing, the Court of Appeals followed one of its prior cases,
Folsom Investment Co. v. Moore, 681 F. 2d 1032 (CA5 1982),in which it held that "a $ 1983 defendant who has invoked an

attachment statute is entitled to an immunity from monetaryliability so long as he neither knew nor reasonably should
have known that the statute was unconstitutional." Id., at1037. The court in Folsom based its holding on two
grounds. First, it viewed the existence of a common law,probable cause defense to the torts of malicious prosecution
and wrongful attachment as evidence that "Congress in en-acting $ 1983 could not have intended to subject to liability
those who in good faith resorted to legal process." Id., at1038. Although it acknowledged that a defense is not the
same as an immunity, the court maintained that it could"transfor[m] a common law defense extant at the time of

$ 1983's passage into an immunity." Ibid. Second, thecourt held that while immunity for private parties is not derived from official immunity, it is based on "the importantpublic interest in permitting ordinary citizens to rely on presumptively valid state laws, in shielding citizens from mone-tary damages when they reasonably resort to a legal process
later held to be unconstitutional, and in protecting a privatecitizen from liability when his role in any unconstitutional
action is marginal." Id., at 1037. In defending the decisionbelow, respondents advance both arguments put forward by
the Court of Appeals in Folsom. Neither is availing.

Section 1983 "creates a species of tort liability that on itsface admits of no immunities." Imbler v. Pachtman, 424

U. S. 409, 417 (1976). Nonetheless, we have accorded cer-tain government officials either absolute or qualified immu504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
nity from suit if the "tradition of immunity was so firmlyrooted in the common law and was supported by such strong

policy reasons that `Congress would have specifically so pro-vided had it wished to abolish the doctrine.' "

Owen v. City
of Independence, 445 U. S. 622, 637 (1980) (quoting Pierson
v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 555 (1967)). If parties seeking immu-nity were shielded from tort liability when Congress enacted

the Civil Rights Act of 1871--$ 1 of which is codified at 42U. S. C. $ 1983--we infer from legislative silence that Congress did not intend to abrogate such immunities when itimposed liability for actions taken under color of state law.
See Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S. 914, 920 (1984); Imbler, supra,
at 421; Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U. S. 522, 529 (1984). Additionally, irrespective of the common law support, we will not
recognize an immunity available at common law if $ 1983's
history or purpose counsel against applying it in $ 1983
actions. Tower, supra, at 920. See also Imbler, supra, at
424-429.

In determining whether there was an immunity at common law that Congress intended to incorporate in the Civil
Rights Act, we look to the most closely analogous torts--in
this case, malicious prosecution and abuse of process. At
common law, these torts provided causes of action against
private defendants for unjustified harm arising out of the
misuse of governmental processes. 2 C. Addison, Law of
Torts || 852, and n. 2, || 868, and n. 1 (1876); T. Cooley, Law
of Torts 187-190 (1879); J. Bishop, Commentaries on NonContract Law $$ 228-250, pp. 91-103, $ 490, p. 218 (1889).

Respondents do not contend that private parties who instituted attachment proceedings and who were subsequently
sued for malicious prosecution or abuse of process were entitled to absolute immunity. And with good reason; although
public prosecutors and judges were accorded absolute immunity at common law, Imbler v. Pachtman, supra, at 421-424,
such protection did not extend to complaining witnesses who,
like respondents, set the wheels of government in motion by

Opinion of the Court
instigating a legal action. Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335,340-341 (1986) ("In 1871, the generally accepted rule was

that one who procured the issuance of an arrest warrant bysubmitting a complaint could be held liable if the complaint
was made maliciously and without probable cause").

Nonetheless, respondents argue that at common law, pri-vate defendants could defeat a malicious prosecution or

abuse of process action if they acted without malice and withprobable cause, and that we should therefore infer that Congress did not intend to abrogate such defenses when it en-acted the Civil Rights Act of 1871. We adopted similar reasoning in Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S., at 555-557. There, we
held that police officers sued for false arrest under $ 1983
were entitled to the defense that they acted with probable
cause and in good faith when making an arrest under a statute they reasonably believed was valid. We recognized this
defense because peace officers were accorded protection from
liability at common law if they arrested an individual in good
faith, even if the innocence of such person were later established. Ibid.

The rationale we adopted in Pierson is of no avail to respondents here. Even if there were sufficient common law
support to conclude that respondents, like the police officers
in Pierson, should be entitled to a good faith defense, that
would still not entitle them to what they sought and obtained
in the courts below: the qualified immunity from suit accorded government officials under Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457
U. S. 800 (1982).

In Harlow, we altered the standard of qualified immunity
adopted in our prior $ 1983 cases because we recognized that
"[t]he subjective element of the good-faith defense frequently
[had] prove[d] incompatible with our admonition . . . that
insubstantial claims should not proceed to trial." Id., at
815-816. Because of the attendant harms to government effectiveness caused by lengthy judicial inquiry into subjective
motivation, we concluded that "bare allegations of malice

504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT
166 WYATT v. COLE

Opinion of the Court
should not suffice to subject government officials either tothe costs of trial or to the burdens of broad-reaching discovery." Id., at 817-818. Accordingly, we held that gov-ernment officials performing discretionary functions are
shielded from "liability for civil damages insofar as their con-duct [did] not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would haveknown."

Id., at 818. This wholly objective standard, weconcluded, would "avoid excessive disruption of government

and permit the resolution of many insubstantial claims onsummary judgment." Ibid.

That Harlow "completely reformulated qualified immunityalong principles not at all embodied in the common law,"

An-derson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 645 (1987), was reinforced

by our decision in Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511 (1985).Mitchell held that Harlow established an "immunity from
suit rather than a mere defense to liability," which, like anabsolute immunity, "is effectively lost if a case is erroneously
permitted to go to trial." 472 U. S., at 526 (emphasis sup-plied). Thus, we held in

Mitchell that the denial of qualifiedimmunity should be immediately appealable. Id., at 530.

It is this type of objectively determined, immediately ap-pealable immunity that respondents asserted below.

2 But,

2 In arguing that respondents are entitled to qualified immunity under
Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800 (1982), the dissent mixes apples and
oranges. Even if we were to agree with the dissent's proposition that
elements a plaintiff was required to prove as part of her case in chief could
somehow be construed as a " `defense,' " post, at 176, n. 1, and that this
"defense" entitles private citizens to some protection from liability, we
cannot agree that respondents are entitled to immunity from suit under
Harlow. One could reasonably infer from the fact that a plaintiff's malicious prosecution or abuse of process action failed if she could not affirmatively establish both malice and want of probable cause that plaintiffs
bringing an analogous suit under $ 1983 should be required to make a
similar showing to sustain a $ 1983 cause of action. Alternatively, if one
accepts the dissent's characterization of the common law as establishing
an affirmative "defense" for private defendants, then one could also conclude that private parties sued under $ 1983 should likewise be entitled to

167Cite as: 504 U. S. 158 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
as our precedents make clear, the reasons for recognizingsuch an immunity were based not simply on the existence of

a good faith defense at common law, but on the special policyconcerns involved in suing government officials.

Harlow,
supra, at 813; Mitchell, supra, at 526. Reviewing these concerns, we conclude that the rationales mandating qualifiedimmunity for public officials are not applicable to private

parties.Qualified immunity strikes a balance between compensating those who have been injured by official conduct andprotecting government's ability to perform its traditional
functions. Harlow, supra, at 819; Pierson, supra, at 554;
Anderson, supra, at 638. Accordingly, we have recognized
qualified immunity for government officials where it was necessary to preserve their ability to serve the public good orto ensure that talented candidates were not deterred by the

threat of damages suits from entering public service. See,
e. g., Wood v. Strickland, 420 U. S. 308, 319 (1975) (denial of
qualified immunity to school board officials " `would contribute not to principled and fearless decision-making but to intimidation' ") (quoting Pierson, supra, at 554); Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478, 506 (1978) (immunity for Presidential
aides warranted partly "to protect officials who are required
to exercise their discretion and the related public interest
in encouraging the vigorous exercise of official authority");
Mitchell, supra, at 526 (immunity designed to prevent the
" `distraction of officials from their governmental duties, inhibition of discretionary action, and deterrence of able people
from public service' " (quoting Harlow, supra, at 816)). In

assert an affirmative defense based on a similar showing of good faith and/
or probable cause. In neither case, however, is it appropriate to make
the dissent's leap: that because these common law torts partially included
an objective component--probable cause--private defendants sued under

$ 1983 should be entitled to the objectively determined, immediately
appealable immunity from suit accorded certain government officials
under Harlow.

168 WYATT v. COLE

Opinion of the Court
short, the qualified immunity recognized in Harlow acts tosafeguard government, and thereby to protect the public at

large, not to benefit its agents.These rationales are not transferable to private parties.
Although principles of equality and fairness may suggest, as
respondents argue, that private citizens who rely unsus-pectingly on state laws they did not create and may have no

reason to believe are invalid should have some protectionfrom liability, as do their government counterparts, such interests are not sufficiently similar to the traditional purposesof qualified immunity to justify such an expansion. Unlike
school board members, see Wood, supra, or police officers,
see Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335 (1986), or Presidential
aides, see Butz, supra, private parties hold no office requiring them to exercise discretion; nor are they principally concerned with enhancing the public good. Accordingly, extending Harlow qualified immunity to private parties would
have no bearing on whether public officials are able to act
forcefully and decisively in their jobs or on whether qualified applicants enter public service. Moreover, unlike with
government officials performing discretionary functions, the
public interest will not be unduly impaired if private individuals are required to proceed to trial to resolve their legal
disputes. In short, the nexus between private parties and
the historic purposes of qualified immunity is simply too
attenuated to justify such an extension of our doctrine of
immunity.

For these reasons, we can offer no relief today. The question on which we granted certiorari is a very narrow one:
"[W]hether private persons, who conspire with state officials
to violate constitutional rights, have available the good faith
immunity applicable to public officials." Pet. for Cert. i.
The precise issue encompassed in this question, and the only
issue decided by the lower courts, is whether qualified immunity, as enunciated in Harlow, is available for private defendants faced with $ 1983 liability for invoking a state replevin,

garnishment, or attachment statute. That answer is no. Inso holding, however, we do not foreclose the possibility that

private defendants faced with $ 1983 liability under Lugar v.Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922 (1982), could be entitled to
an affirmative defense based on good faith and/or probablecause or that $ 1983 suits against private, rather than governmental, parties could require plaintiffs to carry additionalburdens. Because those issues are not fairly before us, however, we leave them for another day. Cf. Yee v. Escondido,503 U. S., 519, 534-538 (1992).

IV
As indicated above, the District Court assumed that underLugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., supra, Cole was liable under

$ 1983 for invoking the state replevin under bond statute,and intimated that, but did not decide whether, Robbins also
was subject to $ 1983 liability. The Court of Appeals neverrevisited this question, but instead concluded only that respondents were entitled to qualified immunity at least forconduct prior to the statute's invalidation. Because we
overturn this judgment, we must remand, since there re-mains to be determined, at least, whether Cole and Robbins,
in invoking the replevin statute, acted under color of statelaw within the meaning of

Lugar. The judgment of theCourt of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for

proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Scalia joins,concurring.
I join the opinion of the Court but find that a further andseparate statement of my views is required.
I agree with what The Chief Justice writes in dissentrespecting the historical origins of our qualified immunity
jurisprudence but submit that the question presented to usrequires that we reverse the judgment, as the majority
holds. Indeed, the result reached by the Court is quite con504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT

sistent, in my view, with a proper application of the history
The Chief Justice relates.

Both the Court and the dissent recognize that our originaldecisions recognizing defenses and immunities to suits

brought under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 rely on analogous limitations
existing in the common law when $ 1983 was enacted. See
ante, at 163-164; post, at 176-177. In Tenney v. Brandhove,
341 U. S. 367, 376 (1951), we held that $ 1983 had not eradi-cated the absolute immunity granted legislators under the

common law. And in Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 555-557(1967), we recognized that under $ 1983 police officers sued
for false arrest had available what we described as a "defense of good faith and probable cause," based on their reasonable belief that the statute under which they acted was
constitutional. Id., at 557. Pierson allowed the defense
because with respect to the analogous common-law tort,
the Court decided that officers had available to them a
similar defense. The good-faith and probable-cause defense
evolved into our modern qualified-immunity doctrine. Ante,
at 165-166.

Our immunity doctrine is rooted in historical analogy,
based on the existence of common-law rules in 1871, rather
than in "freewheeling policy choice[s]." Malley v. Briggs,
475 U. S. 335, 342 (1986). In cases involving absolute immunity we adhere to that view, granting immunity to the extent
consistent with historical practice. Ibid.; Burns v. Reed, 500
U. S. 478, 485 (1991); Hafer v. Melo, 502 U. S. 21, 28-29 (1991).

In the context of qualified immunity for public officials, however, we have diverged to a substantial degree from the historical standards. In Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800
(1982), we "completely reformulated qualified immunity
along principles not at all embodied in the common law,
replacing the inquiry into subjective malice so frequently
required at common law with an objective inquiry into the
legal reasonableness of the official action." Anderson v.
Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 645 (1987). The transformation

was justified by the special policy concerns arising from pub-lic officials' exposure to repeated suits.

Harlow, supra, at
813-814; ante, at 165-166. The dissent in today's case ar-gues that similar considerations justify a transformation of

common-law standards in the context of private-party defendants. Post, at 179-180. With this I cannot agree.We need not decide whether or not it was appropriate for

the Court in Harlow to depart from history in the name ofpublic policy, reshaping immunity doctrines in light of those
policy considerations. But I would not extend that approachto other contexts.

Harlow was decided at a time when the
standards applicable to summary judgment made it difficult
for a defendant to secure summary judgment regarding a
factual question such as subjective intent, even when the
plaintiff bore the burden of proof on the question; and in
Harlow we relied on that fact in adopting an objective standard for qualified immunity. 457 U. S., at 815-819. However, subsequent clarifications to summary-judgment law
have alleviated that problem, by allowing summary judgment to be entered against a nonmoving party "who fails to
make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an
element essential to that party's case, and on which that
party will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp.
v. Catrett, 477 U. S. 317, 322 (1986). Under the principles
set forth in Celotex and related cases, the strength of factual
allegations such as subjective bad faith can be tested at the
summary-judgment stage.

It must be remembered that unlike the common-law
judges whose doctrines we adopt, we are devising limitations
to a remedial statute, enacted by the Congress, which "on its
face does not provide for any immunities." Malley, supra,
at 342 (emphasis in original). We have imported commonlaw doctrines in the past because of our conclusion that the
Congress which enacted $ 1983 acted in light of existing legal
principles. Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U. S. 622,
637-638 (1980). That suggests, however, that we may not

Kennedy, J., concurring
transform what existed at common law based on our notionsof policy or efficiency.

My conclusions are a mere consequence of the historicalprinciples described in the dissent of

The Chief Justice.
The common-law tort actions most analogous to the action
commenced here were malicious prosecution and abuse ofprocess.

Post, at 176. In both of the common-law actions,
it was essential for the plaintiff to prove that the wrongdoeracted with malice and without probable cause.

Post, at 176,
n. 1. As The Chief Justice states, it is something of amisnomer to describe the common law as creating a goodfaith defense; we are in fact concerned with the essence of
the wrong itself, with the essential elements of the tort.
The malice element required the plaintiff to show that the
challenged action was undertaken with an unlawful purpose,
though it did not require a showing of ill will towards the
plaintiff. J. Bishop, Commentaries on Non-Contract Law

$ 232, p. 92 (1889). To establish the absence of probable
cause, a plaintiff was required to prove that a reasonable
person, knowing what the defendant did, would not have believed that the prosecution or suit was well grounded, or that
the defendant had in fact acted with the belief that the suit
or prosecution in question was without probable cause. Id.,

$ 239, at 95. Our cases on the subject, beginning with Harlow v. Fitzgerald, diverge from the common law in two ways.
First, as The Chief Justice acknowledges, modern qualified immunity does not turn upon the subjective belief of
the defendant. Post, at 178, n. 2. Second, the immunity
diverges from the common-law model by requiring the defendant, not the plaintiff, to bear the burden of proof on the
probable-cause issue. Supra this page.

The decision to impose these requirements under a rule
of immunity has implications, though, well beyond a mere
determination that one party or the other is in a better position to bear the burden of proof. It implicates as well the
law's definition of the wrong itself. At common law the ac504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT

173Cite as: 504 U. S. 158 (1992)
Kennedy, J., concurring
tion lay because the essence of the wrong was an injurycaused by a suit or prosecution commenced without probable

cause or with knowledge that it was baseless. To cast theissue in terms of immunity, however, is to imply that a wrong
was committed but that it cannot be redressed. The difference is fundamental, for at stake is the concept of what soci-ety considers proper conduct and what it does not. Beneath

the nomenclature lie considerations of substance.

Harlow was cast as an immunity case, involving as it did
suit against officers of the Government. And immunity, asdistinct, say, from a defense on the merits or an element of

the plaintiff 's cause of action, is a legal inquiry, decided by
the court rather than a jury, and on which an interlocutory
appeal is available to defendants. Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472
U. S. 511 (1985). Whether or not it is correct to diverge in
these respects from the common-law model when governmental agents are the defendants, we ought not to adopt an
automatic rule that the same analysis applies in suits against
private persons. See ante, at 166-167, n. 2. By casting the
rule as an immunity, we imply the underlying conduct was
unlawful, a most debatable proposition in a case where a
private citizen may have acted in good-faith reliance upon
a statute. And as we have defined the immunity, we also
eliminate from the case any demonstration of subjective good
faith. Under the common law, however, if the plaintiff could
prove subjective bad faith on the part of the defendant, he
had gone far towards proving both malice and lack of probable cause. Moreover, the question of the defendant's beliefs
was almost always one for the jury. Stewart v. Sonneborn,
98 U. S. 187, 194 (1879).

It is true that good faith may be difficult to establish in
the face of a showing that from an objective standpoint no
reasonable person could have acted as the defendant did, and
in many cases the result would be the same under either
test. This is why Stewart describes the instances where the
probable cause turns on subjective intent as the exceptional

174 WYATT v. COLE

Kennedy, J., concurring
case. Ibid.; post, at 178, n. 2. That does not mean, how-ever, that we may deprive plaintiffs of the opportunity to

make their case. In some cases eliminating the defensebased on subjective good faith can make a real difference,
and again the instant case of alleged reliance on a statute
deemed valid provides the example. It seems problematicto say that a defendant should be relieved of liability under

some automatic rule of immunity if objective reliance upon astatute is reasonable but the defendant in fact had knowledge of its invalidity. Because the burden of proof on thisquestion is the plaintiff 's, the question may be resolved on
summary judgment if the plaintiff cannot come forward with
facts from which bad faith can be inferred. But the question
is a factual one, and a plaintiff may rely on circumstantial
rather than direct evidence to make his case. Siegert v.
Gilley, 500 U. S. 226, 236 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring in
judgment). The rule, of course, also works in reverse, for
the existence of a statute thought valid ought to allow a defendant to argue that he acted in subjective good faith and is
entitled to exoneration no matter what the objective test is.

The distinction I draw is important because there is support in the common law for the proposition that a private
individual's reliance on a statute, prior to a judicial determination of unconstitutionality, is considered reasonable as a
matter of law; and therefore under the circumstances of this
case, lack of probable cause can only be shown through proof
of subjective bad faith. Birdsall v. Smith, 158 Mich. 390,
394, 122 N. W. 626, 627 (1909). Thus the subjective element
dismissed as exceptional by the dissent may be the rule
rather than the exception.

I join the opinion of the Court because I believe there is
nothing contrary to what I say in that opinion. See ante,
at 169 ("[W]e do not foreclose the possibility that private
defendants faced with $ 1983 liability . . . could be entitled to

cause or that $ 1983 suits against private . . . parties could

require plaintiffs to carry additional burdens"). Thoughthey described the issue before them as "good-faith immunity," both the District Court and the Court of Appealstreated the question as one of law. App. 12-14; 928 F. 2d
718, 721-722 (CA5 1991). The Court of Appeals in particular
placed heavy reliance on the policy considerations favoring arule that citizens may rely on statutes presumed to be valid.

Ibid. The latter inquiry, as Birdsall recognizes, however,goes mainly to the question of objective reasonableness. I
do not understand either the District Court or the Court ofAppeals to make an unequivocal finding that the respondents
before us acted with subjective good faith when they filedsuit under the Mississippi replevin statute. Furthermore,
the question on which we granted certiorari was the narrow
one whether private defendants in $ 1983 suits are entitled
to the same qualified immunity applicable to public officials,
ante, at 168, which of course would be subject to the objective standard of Harlow v. Fitzgerald. Under my view the
answer to that question is no. Though it might later be determined that there is no triable issue of fact to save the
plaintiff 's case in the matter now before us, on remand it
ought to be open to him at least in theory to argue that the
defendants' bad faith eliminates any reliance on the statute,
just as it ought to be open to the defendants to show good
faith even if some construct of a reasonable person in the
defendants' position would have acted in a different way.

So I agree the case must be remanded for further
proceedings.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Souter
and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The Court notes that we have recognized an immunity in
the $ 1983 context in two circumstances. The first is when
a similarly situated defendant would have enjoyed an immunity at common law at the time $ 1983 was adopted. Ante,
at 163-164. The second is when important public policy con504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
cerns suggest the need for an immunity. Ante, at 166-167.Because I believe that both requirements, as explained in

our prior decisions, are satisfied here, I dissent.First, I think it is clear that at the time $ 1983 was
adopted, there generally was available to private parties agood-faith defense to the torts of malicious prosecution and
abuse of process.1 See authorities cited ante, at 164; Malleyv.

Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 340-341 (1986) (noting that the gen-erally accepted rule at common law was that a person would

be held liable if "the complaint was made maliciously andwithout probable cause"); Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 555
(1967) (noting that at common law a police officer sued forfalse arrest can rely on his own good faith in making the
arrest). And while the Court is willing to assume as much,
ante, at 165, it thinks this insufficient to sustain respondents'claim to an immunity because the "qualified immunity" respondents' seek is not equivalent to such a "defense," ante,at 165-166.

But I think the Court errs in suggesting that the availabil-ity of a good-faith common-law defense at the time of $ 1983's
adoption is not sufficient to support their claim to immunity.The case on which respondents principally rely,

Pierson, con-sidered whether a police officer sued under $ 1983 for false

arrest could rely on a showing of good faith in order to es-cape liability. And while this Court concluded that the officer could rely on his own good faith, based in large part onthe fact that a good-faith defense had been available at common law, the Court was at best ambiguous as to whether it

1 Describing the common law as providing a "defense" is something of a
misnomer--under the common law it was plaintiff's burden to establish as
elements of the tort both that the defendant acted with malice and without
probable cause. T. Cooley, Law of Torts 184-185 (1879); J. Bishop, Commentaries on Non-Contract Law $ 225, p. 90 (1889). Referring to the defendant as having a good-faith defense is a useful shorthand for capturing
plaintiff's burden and the related notion that a defendant could avoid liability by establishing either a lack of malice or the presence of probable
cause.

was recognizing a "defense" or an "immunity." Compare386 U. S., at 556 (criticizing Court of Appeals for concluding

that no "immunity" was available), with id., at 557 (recogniz-ing a good-faith "defense"). Any initial ambiguity, however,
has certainly been eliminated by subsequent cases; there can
be no doubt that it is a qualified immunity to which the offi-cer is entitled. See

Malley, supra, at 340. Similarly, in
Wood v. Strickland, 420 U. S. 308, 318 (1975), we recognizedthat, "[a]lthough there have been differing emphases and formulations of the common-law immunity," the general recog-nition under state law that public officers are entitled to a
good-faith defense was sufficient to support the recognition
of a $ 1983 immunity.

Thus, unlike the Court, I think our prior precedent establishes that a demonstration that a good-faith defense was
available at the time $ 1983 was adopted does, in fact, provide
substantial support for a contemporary defendant claiming
that he is entitled to qualified immunity in the analogous

$ 1983 context. While we refuse to recognize a common-law
immunity if $ 1983's history or purpose counsel against applying it, ante, at 164, I see no such history or purpose that
would so counsel here.

Indeed, I am at a loss to understand what is accomplished
by today's decision--other than a needlessly fastidious adherence to nomenclature--given that the Court acknowledges that a good-faith defense will be available for respondents to assert on remand. Respondents presumably will be
required to show the traditional elements of a good-faith
defense--either that they acted without malice or that
they acted with probable cause. See n. 1, supra; Stewart
v. Sonneborn, 98 U. S. 187, 194 (1879); W. Prosser, Law of
Torts $ 120, p. 854 (4th ed. 1971). The first element, "maliciousness," encompasses an inquiry into subjective intent
for bringing the suit. Stewart, supra, at 192-193; Prosser,
supra, $ 120, at 855. This quite often includes an inquiry
into the defendant's subjective belief as to whether he be504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT

lieved success was likely. See, e. g., 2 C. Addison, Law ofTorts || 854 (1876) ("Proof of the absence of belief in the truth

of the charge by the person making it . . . is almost alwaysinvolved in the proof of malice"). But the second element,
"probable cause," focuses principally on objective reasonable-ness.

Stewart, supra, at 194; Prosser, supra, $ 120, at 854.Thus, respondents can successfully defend this suit simply

by establishing that their reliance on the replevin statutewas objectively reasonable for someone with their knowledge
of the circumstances. But this is precisely the showing thatentitles a public official to immunity. Harlow v. Fitzgerald,
457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982) (official must show his action did not"violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights
of which a reasonable person would have known").2Nor do I see any reason that this "defense" may not be
asserted early in the proceedings on a motion for summaryjudgment, just as a claim to qualified immunity may be. Provided that the historical facts are not in dispute, the presence
or absence of "probable cause" has long been acknowledgedto be a question of law.

Stewart, supra, at 193-194; 2 Addison, supra, || 853, n. (p); J. Bishop, Commentaries on Non-Contract Law $ 240, p. 95 (1889). And so I see no reason

that the trial judge may not resolve a summary judgmentmotion premised on such a good-faith defense, just as we
have encouraged trial judges to do with respect to qualified

2 There is perhaps one small difference between the historic commonlaw inquiry and the modern qualified immunity inquiry. At common law,
a plaintiff can show the lack of probable cause either by showing that the
actual facts did not amount to probable cause (an objective inquiry) or by
showing that the defendant lacked a sincere belief that probable cause
existed (a subjective inquiry). Bishop, Commentaries on Non-Contract
Law $ 239, at 95. But relying on the subjective belief, rather than on an
objective lack of probable cause, is clearly exceptional. See Stewart v.
Sonneborn, 98 U. S. 187, 194 (1879) (describing subjective basis for finding
lack of probable cause as exception to general rule). I see no reason to
base our decision whether to extend a contemporary, objectively based
qualified immunity on the exceptional common-law case.

immunity claims. Harlow, supra, at 818. Thus, private de-fendants who have invoked a state attachment law are put

in the same position whether we recognize that they are enti-tled to qualified immunity or if we instead recognize a goodfaith defense. Perhaps the Court believes that the "defense" will be less amenable to summary disposition than willthe "immunity"; perhaps it believes the defense will be an

issue that must be submitted to the jury, see ante, at 168(referring to cases such as this "proceed[ing] to trial").
While I can see no reason why this would be so (given thatprobable cause is a legal question), if it is true, today's decision will only manage to increase litigation costs needlessly
for hapless defendants.

This, in turn, leads to the second basis on which we have
previously recognized a qualified immunity--reasons of public policy. Assuming that some practical difference will result from recognizing a defense but not an immunity, I think
such a step is neither dictated by our prior decisions nor
desirable. It is true, as the Court points out, that in abandoning a strictly historical approach to $ 1983 immunities we
have often explained our decision to recognize an immunity
in terms of the special needs of public officials. But those
cases simply do not answer--because the question was not
at issue--whether similar (or even completely unrelated) reasons of public policy would warrant immunity for private
parties as well.

I believe there are such reasons. The normal presumption that attaches to any law is that society will be benefited
if private parties rely on that law to provide them a remedy,
rather than turning to some form of private, and perhaps
lawless, relief. In denying immunity to those who reasonably rely on presumptively valid state law, and thereby discouraging such reliance, the Court expresses confidence that
today's decision will not "unduly impai[r]," ibid., the public
interest. I do not share that confidence. I would have
thought it beyond peradventure that there is strong public

interest in encouraging private citizens to rely on valid statelaws of which they have no reason to doubt the validity. Buller v. Buechler, 706 F. 2d 844, 851 (CA8 1983); Folsom Invest-ment Co. v. Moore, 681 F. 2d 1032, 1037-1038 (CA5 1982).

Second, as with the police officer making an arrest, I be-lieve the private plaintiff 's lot is "not so unhappy" that he
must forgo recovery of property he believes to be properlyrecoverable through available legal processes or to be
"mulcted in damages," Pierson, 386 U. S., at 555, if his beliefturns out to be mistaken. For as one Court of Appeals has
pointed out, it is at least passing strange to conclude thatprivate individuals are acting "under color of law" because
they invoke a state garnishment statute and the aid of stateofficers, see Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922
(1982), but yet deny them the immunity to which those samestate officers are entitled, simply because the private parties
are not state employees. Buller, supra, at 851. Whilesome of the strangeness may be laid at the doorstep of our
decision in Lugar, see 457 U. S., at 943 (Burger, C. J., dissent-ing); and

id., at 944-956 (Powell, J., dissenting), there is noreason to proceed still further down this path. Our $ 1983

jurisprudence has gone very far afield indeed, when it sub-jects private parties to greater risk than their public counterparts, despite the fact that $ 1983's historic purpose was"to prevent state officials from using the cloak of their authority under state law to violate rights protected againststate infringement."

Id., at 948 (emphasis added). See alsoMonroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 175-176 (1961).

Because I find today's decision dictated neither by our ownprecedent nor by any sound considerations of public policy,
I dissent.

WADE v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 91-5771. Argued March 23, 1992--Decided May 18, 1992
After his arrest on, inter alia, federal drug charges, petitioner Wade gave

law enforcement officials information that led them to arrest another
drug dealer. Subsequently, he pleaded guilty to the charges, and the
District Court sentenced him to the 10-year minimum sentence required
by 21 U. S. C. $ 841(b)(1)(B) and the United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (USSG). The court refused Wade's request
that his sentence be reduced below the minimum to reward him for
his substantial assistance to the Government, holding that 18 U. S. C.

$ 3553(e) and USSG $ 5K1.1 empower the district courts to make such a
reduction only if the Government files a motion requesting the departure. The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting Wade's arguments that
the District Court erred in holding that the absence of a Government
motion deprived it of the authority to reduce his sentence and that the
lower court was authorized to enquire into the Government's motives
for failing to file a motion.

Held:

1. Federal district courts have the authority to review the Government's refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion and to grant a remedy if they find that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive.
Since the parties assume that the statutory and Guidelines provisions
pose identical and equally burdensome obstacles, this Court is not required to decide whether $ 5K1.1 "implements" and thereby supersedes

$ 3553(e) or whether the provisions pose separate obstacles. In both
provisions, the condition limiting the court's authority gives the Government a power, not a duty, to file a substantial-assistance motion. Nonetheless, a prosecutor's discretion when exercising that power is subject
to constitutional limitations that district courts can enforce. Thus, a
defendant would be entitled to relief if the prosecution refused to file a
motion for a suspect reason such as the defendant's race or religion.
However, neither a claim that a defendant merely provided substantial
assistance nor additional but generalized allegations of improper motive
will entitle a defendant to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing. A defendant has a right to the latter procedures
only if he makes a substantial threshold showing of improper motive.

182 WADE v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
2. Wade has failed to raise a claim of improper motive. He has never
alleged or pointed to evidence tending to show that the Government
refused to file a motion for suspect reasons. And he argues to no avail
that, because the District Court erroneously believed that no impermissible motive charge could state a claim for relief, it thwarted his attempt
to show that the Government violated his constitutional rights by withholding the motion arbitrarily or in bad faith. While Wade would be
entitled to relief if the prosecutor's refusal to move was not rationally
related to any legitimate Government end, the record here shows no
support for his claim of frustration, and the claim as presented to the
District Court failed to rise to the level warranting judicial enquiry. In
response to the court's invitation to state what evidence he would introduce to support his claim, Wade merely explained the extent of his assistance to the Government. This is a necessary, but not a sufficient,
condition for relief, because the Government's decision not to move may
have been based simply on its rational assessment of the cost and benefit
that would flow from moving. Pp. 186-187.

936 F. 2d 169, affirmed.

Souter, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

J. Matthew Martin, by appointment of the Court, 502 U. S.1028, argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the

Section 3553(e) of Title 18 of the United States Code em-powers district courts, "[u]pon motion of the Government,"

to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum to reflecta defendant's "substantial assistance in the investigation or

Opinion of the Court
district courts to go below the minimum required under the
Guidelines if the Government files a "substantial assistance"
motion. This case presents the question whether district
courts may subject the Government's refusal to file such a
motion to review for constitutional violations. We hold that
they may, but that the petitioner has raised no claim to
such review.

On October 30, 1989, police searched the house of the
petitioner, Harold Ray Wade, Jr., discovered 978 grams of
cocaine, two handguns, and more than $22,000 in cash, and
arrested Wade. In the aftermath of the search, Wade gave
law enforcement officials information that led them to arrest
another drug dealer. In due course, a federal grand jury
indicted Wade for distributing cocaine and possessing cocaine with intent to distribute it, both in violation of 21
U. S. C. $ 841(a)(1); for conspiring to do these things, in violation of $ 846; and for using or carrying a firearm during,
and in relation to, a drug crime, in violation of 18 U. S. C.

$ 924(c)(1). Wade pleaded guilty to all four counts.

The presentence report put the sentencing range under
the Guidelines for the drug offenses at 97 to 121 months, but
added that Wade was subject to a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence, 21 U. S. C. $ 841(b)(1)(B), narrowing the
actual range to 120 to 121 months, see USSG $ 5G1.1(c)(2).
The report also stated that both USSG $ 2K2.4(a) and 18
U. S. C. $ 924(c) required a 5-year sentence on the gun count.
At the sentencing hearing in the District Court, Wade's lawyer urged the court to impose a sentence below the 10-year
minimum for the drug counts to reward Wade for his assistance to the Government. The court responded that the Government had filed no motion as contemplated in 18 U. S. C.

$ 3553(e) and USSG $ 5K1.1 for sentencing below the minimum, and ruled that, without such a motion, a court had no
power to go beneath the minimum. Wade got a sentence of
180 months in prison.

184 WADE v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
In the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Cir-cuit, Wade argued the District Court was in error to say that

the absence of a Government motion deprived it of authorityto impose a sentence below 10 years for the drug convictions.
Wade lost this argument, 936 F. 2d 169, 171 (1991), and failedas well on his back-up claim that the District Court was at
least authorized to enquire into the Government's motivesfor filing no motion, the court saying that any such enquiry
would intrude unduly upon a prosecutor's discretion, id., at172. We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 1003 (1991), and now
affirm.The full text of 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(e) is this:

"Limited Authority to Impose a Sentence Below a Stat-utory Minimum.--Upon motion of the Government, the
court shall have the authority to impose a sentencebelow a level established by statute as minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant's substantial assistancein the investigation or prosecution of another person
who has committed an offense. Such sentence shall beimposed in accordance with the guidelines and policy
statements issued by the Sentencing Commission pursu-ant to section 994 of title 28, United States Code."

And this is the relevant portion of USSG $ 5K1.1:

"Substant i al Assistance t o Author i ti es (PolicyStatement)

"Upon motion of the government stating that the de-fendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who hascommitted an offense, the court may depart from the
guidelines."
Because Wade violated federal criminal statutes that carrymandatory minimum sentences, this case implicates both 18

U. S. C. $ 3553(e) and USSG $ 5K1.1. Wade and the Govern-ment apparently assume that where, as here, the minimum

Opinion of the Court
under the Guidelines is the same as the statutory minimumand the Government has refused to file any motion at all,

the two provisions pose identical and equally burdensomeobstacles. See Brief for Petitioner 9, n. 2; Brief for United
States 11, n. 2. We are not, therefore, called upon to decide whether $ 5K1.1 "implements" and thereby supersedes$ 3553(e), see

United States v. Ah-Kai, 951 F. 2d 490, 493-494
(CA2 1991); United States v. Keene, 933 F. 2d 711, 713-714(CA9 1991), or whether the two provisions pose two separate

obstacles, see United States v. Rodriguez-Morales, 958 F. 2d1441, 1443-1447 (CA8 1992).

Wade concedes, as a matter of statutory interpretation,
that $ 3553(e) imposes the condition of a Government motion
upon the district court's authority to depart, Brief for Petitioner 9-10, and he does not argue otherwise with respect
to $ 5K1.1. He does not claim that the Government-motion
requirement is itself unconstitutional, or that the condition
is superseded in this case by any agreement on the Government's behalf to file a substantial-assistance motion, cf. Santobello v. New York, 404 U. S. 257, 262-263 (1971); United
States v. Conner, 930 F. 2d 1073, 1075-1077 (CA4), cert. denied, 502 U. S. 958 (1991). Wade's position is consistent with
the view, which we think is clearly correct, that in both

$ 3553(e) and $ 5K1.1 the condition limiting the court's authority gives the Government a power, not a duty, to file a
motion when a defendant has substantially assisted.

Wade nonetheless argues, and again we agree, that a
prosecutor's discretion when exercising that power is subject
to constitutional limitations that district courts can enforce.
Because we see no reason why courts should treat a prosecutor's refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion differently
from a prosecutor's other decisions, see, e. g., Wayte v. United
States, 470 U. S. 598, 608-609 (1985), we hold that federal
district courts have authority to review a prosecutor's refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion and to grant a
remedy if they find that the refusal was based on an uncon504us1$72z 04-04-96 21:08:22 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
stitutional motive. Thus, a defendant would be entitled torelief if a prosecutor refused to file a substantial-assistance

motion, say, because of the defendant's race or religion.It follows that a claim that a defendant merely provided
substantial assistance will not entitle a defendant to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing. Norwould additional but generalized allegations of improper motive. See, e. g., United States v. Redondo-Lemos, 955 F. 2d1296, 1302-1303 (CA9 1992);

United States v. Jacob, 781 F. 2d
643, 646-647 (CA8 1986); United States v. Gallegos-Curiel,681 F. 2d 1164, 1169 (CA9 1982) (Kennedy, J.);

United States
v. Berrios, 501 F. 2d 1207, 1211 (CA2 1974). Indeed, Wade
concedes that a defendant has no right to discovery or an
evidentiary hearing unless he makes a "substantial threshold
showing." Brief for Petitioner 26.

Wade has failed to make one. He has never alleged, much
less claimed to have evidence tending to show, that the Government refused to file a motion for suspect reasons such as
his race or his religion. Instead, Wade argues now that the
District Court thwarted his attempt to make quite different
allegations on the record because it erroneously believed that
no charge of impermissible motive could state a claim for
relief. Hence, he now seeks an order of remand to allow him
to develop a claim that the Government violated his constitutional rights by withholding a substantial-assistance motion
"arbitrarily" or "in bad faith." See Brief for Petitioner 25.
This, Wade says, the Government did by refusing to move
because of "factors that are not rationally related to any legitimate state objective," see Reply Brief for Petitioner 4,
although he does not specifically identify any such factors.

As the Government concedes, see Brief for United States
26 (citing New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U. S. 297, 303 (1976)
(per curiam)), Wade would be entitled to relief if the prosecutor's refusal to move was not rationally related to any legitimate Government end, cf. Chapman v. United States, 500
U. S. 453, 464-465 (1991), but his argument is still of no avail.

Opinion of the Court
This is so because the record shows no support for his claimof frustration in trying to plead an adequate claim, and because his claim as presented to the District Court failed torise to the level warranting judicial enquiry. The District
Court expressly invited Wade's lawyer to state for the recordwhat evidence he would introduce to support his position
if the court were to conduct a hearing on the issue. App.10. In response, his counsel merely explained the extent
of Wade's assistance to the Government. Ibid. This, ofcourse, was not enough, for although a showing of assistance
is a necessary condition for relief, it is not a sufficient one.The Government's decision not to move may have been based
not on a failure to acknowledge or appreciate Wade's help,but simply on its rational assessment of the cost and benefit
that would flow from moving. Cf. United States v. Doe, 290U. S. App. D. C. 65, 70, 934 F. 2d 353, 358, cert. denied, 502
U. S. 896 (1991); United States v. La Guardia, 902 F. 2d 1010,1016 (CA1 1990).

It is clear, then, that, on the present record, Wade is en-titled to no relief, and that the judgment of the Court of
Appeals must be

COLEMAN v. THOMPSON, WARDEN, et al.

on application for stay of execution ofsentence of death

No. A-877 (91-8336). Decided May 20, 1992
In the 12th round of judicial review in a murder case which began 11

years ago, the District Court concluded that applicant Coleman had
failed to produce even a "colorable claim of innocence."

Held: The application for a stay of execution is denied. There is no basis

for this Court to conclude that Coleman has produced "substantial evidence" of innocence, especially where the District Court has reviewed
the claim and rejected it on the merits.

Application denied.

Per Curiam.
As the District Court below observed, this is now the 12thround of judicial review in a murder case which began 11

years ago. Yet despite having had 11 years to produceexculpatory evidence, Coleman has produced what, in the
words of the District Court, does not even amount to a"colorable showing of `actual innocence.' " Civ. Action No.
92-0352-R (WD Va., May 12, 1992), p. 19. We are hardlywell positioned to second-guess the District Court's factual
conclusion--we certainly have no basis for concluding thatColeman has produced "

substantial evidence that he may beinnocent." Post, at 189 (emphasis added). Indeed, a good

deal of Coleman's effort in this latest round is devoted to anattempt to undermine an expert's genetic analysis that further implicated him in the crime--an analysis conductedafter trial at

Coleman's request under the supervision of theCommonwealth's courts.

Contrary to the dissent's characterization, Coleman's claimis far from "substantially identical" to that of Leonel Herrera, see Herrera v. Collins, No. 91-7328, cert. granted, 502U. S. 1085 (1992). In

Herrera the District Court concludedthat the evidence of innocence warranted further inquiry.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
See 954 F. 2d 1029 (CA5 1992). Here, in contrast, the District Court reviewed Coleman's claim of innocence and rejected it on the merits.

The application for stay of execution presented to The
Chief Justice and by him referred to the full Court is
denied.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens concurs in the denial of a stay and
would deny the petition for writ of certiorari.

Justice Blackmun, dissenting.
Last Term the Court ruled that Roger Coleman could not
present his arguments on the merits to the federal courts,
simply because the person then acting as his attorney had
made a trivial error in filing his notice of appeal three days
late. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991). While I
dissented from that ruling--and still believe it was erroneous--I found some consolation in the Court's suggestion that
matters might have been different had Coleman argued that
he was actually innocent of the crime. See id., at 747-751,
757.

Coleman has now produced substantial evidence that he
may be innocent of the crime for which he was sentenced to
die. Yet the Court once again turns him away, this time
permitting the Commonwealth of Virginia to execute him
without a hearing at which his evidence could be fully presented. The Court's ruling is all the more troubling for me,
in view of this Court's decision to hear argument next Term
in a case in which the petitioner contends, just as Coleman
does, that evidence of his innocence entitles him to a hearing on the merits. Herrera v. Collins, No. 91-7328, cert.
granted, 502 U. S. 1085 (1992).

I have previously voted to stay an execution pending this
Court's decision next Term in Herrera. See Ellis v. Texas,
503 U. S. 915 (1992); Ellis v. Collins, 503 U. S. 915 (1992). I

cannot believe that Coleman, who raises a substantially iden-tical claim, should be denied all possibility of relief simply

because his petition reached this Court later than did LeonelHerrera's. Accordingly, I would stay the execution.

Justice Souter would grant the application for stay ofexecution.

No. 90-1056. Argued October 8, 1991--Decided May 26, 1992
Respondent Freeman, while the treasurer for a political campaign in Tennessee, filed an action in the Chancery Court, alleging, among other
things, that $ 2-7-111(b) of the Tennessee Code--which prohibits the
solicitation of votes and the display or distribution of campaign materials within 100 feet of the entrance to a polling place--limited her ability
to communicate with voters in violation of, inter alia, the First and
Fourteenth Amendments. The court dismissed her suit, but the State
Supreme Court reversed, ruling that the State had a compelling interest
in banning such activities within the polling place itself but not on the
premises around the polling place. Thus, it concluded, the 100-foot limit
was not narrowly tailored to protect, and was not the least restrictive
means to serve, the State's interests.

Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
802 S. W. 2d 210, reversed and remanded.

Justice Blackmun, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice White,
and Justice Kennedy, concluded that $ 2-7-111(b) does not violate the
First and Fourteenth Amendments. Pp. 196-211.

(a) The section is a facially content-based restriction on political
speech in a public forum and, thus, must be subjected to exacting scrutiny: The State must show that the regulation is necessary to serve a
compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that
end. This case presents a particularly difficult reconciliation, since it
involves a conflict between the exercise of the right to engage in political
discourse and the fundamental right to vote, which is at the heart of
this country's democracy. Pp. 196-198.

(b) Section 2-7-111(b) advances Tennessee's compelling interests in
preventing voter intimidation and election fraud. There is a substantial
and long-lived consensus among the 50 States that some restricted zone
around polling places is necessary to serve the interest in protecting the
right to vote freely and effectively. The real question then is how large
a restricted zone is permissible or sufficiently tailored. A State is not
required to prove empirically that an election regulation is perfectly
tailored to secure such a compelling interest. Rather, legislatures
should be permitted to respond to potential deficiencies in the electoral
process with foresight, provided that the response is reasonable and

does not significantly impinge on constitutionally protected rights.
Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U. S. 189, 195-196. Section 2-7-
111(b)'s minor geographical limitation does not constitute such a significant impingement. While it is possible that at some measurable distance from the polls governmental regulation of vote solicitation could
effectively become an impermissible burden on the First Amendment,
Tennessee, in establishing its 100-foot boundary, is on the constitutional
side of the line. Pp. 198-211.

Justice Scalia concluded that $ 2-7-111 is constitutional because it
is a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral regulation of a nonpublic forum. The
environs of a polling place, including adjacent streets and sidewalks,
have traditionally not been devoted to assembly and debate and therefore do not constitute a traditional public forum. Cf. Greer v. Spock,
424 U. S. 828. Thus, speech restrictions such as those in $ 2-7-111 need
not be subjected to "exacting scrutiny" analysis. Pp. 214-216.

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
Justice Blackmun announced the judgment of the Court
and delivered an opinion, in which The Chief Justice, Justice White, and Justice Kennedy join.

Twenty-six years ago, this Court, in a majority opinion
written by Justice Hugo L. Black, struck down a state law
that made it a crime for a newspaper editor to publish an
editorial on election day urging readers to vote in a particular way. Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S. 214 (1966). While the
Court did not hesitate to denounce the statute as an "obvious
and flagrant abridgment" of First Amendment rights, id., at
219, it was quick to point out that its holding "in no way
involve[d] the extent of a State's power to regulate conduct
in and around the polls in order to maintain peace, order and
decorum there," id., at 218.

Today, we confront the issue carefully left open in Mills.
The question presented is whether a provision of the Tennessee Code, which prohibits the solicitation of votes and the
display or distribution of campaign materials within 100 feet
of the entrance to a polling place, violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

I

The State of Tennessee has carved out an election-day
"campaign-free zone" through $ 2-7-111(b) of its election
code. That section reads in pertinent part:

"Within the appropriate boundary as established in
subsection (a) [100 feet from the entrances], and the
building in which the polling place is located, the display
of campaign posters, signs or other campaign materials,
distribution of campaign materials, and solicitation of
votes for or against any person or political party or posiNevada, Nicholas J. Spaeth of North Dakota, Mark Barnett of South Dakota, Paul Van Dam of Utah, Mary Sue Terry of Virginia, and Mario

Violation of $ 2-7-111(b) is a Class C misdemeanor punish-able by a term of imprisonment not greater than 30 days or
a fine not to exceed $50, or both. Tenn. Code Ann. $$ 2-19-119 and 40-35-111(e)(3) (1990).

II
Respondent Mary Rebecca Freeman has been a candidatefor office in Tennessee, has managed local campaigns, and has

worked actively in statewide elections. In 1987, she was thetreasurer for the campaign of a city-council candidate in Metropolitan Nashville-Davidson County.Asserting that $$ 2-7-111(b) and 2-19-119 limited her ability to communicate with voters, respondent brought a facialchallenge to these statutes in Davidson County Chancery
Court. She sought a declaratory judgment that the provi-sions were unconstitutional under both the United States
and the Tennessee Constitutions. She also sought a perma-nent injunction against their enforcement.

The Chancellor ruled that the statutes did not violate theUnited States or Tennessee Constitutions and dismissed respondent's suit. App. 50. He determined that $ 2-7-111(b)was a content-neutral and reasonable time, place, and manner restriction; that the 100-foot boundary served a compel-ling state interest in protecting voters from interference, ha1 Section 2-7-111(a) also provides for boundaries of 300 feet for counties
within specified population ranges. Petitioner's predecessor Attorney
General (an original defendant) opined that this distinction was unconstitutional under Art. XI, $ 8, of the Tennessee Constitution. Tenn. Op. Atty.
Gen. No. 87-185 (1987). While this issue was raised in the pleadings, the
District Court held that respondent did not have standing to challenge the
300-foot boundaries because she was not a resident of any of those counties. The Tennessee Supreme Court did not reach the issue. Accordingly, the constitutionality of the 100-foot boundary is the only restriction
before us.

rassment, and intimidation during the voting process; andthat there was an alternative channel for respondent to exercise her free speech rights outside the 100-foot boundary.App. to Pet. for Cert. 1a.

The Tennessee Supreme Court, by a 4-to-1 vote, reversed.
802 S. W. 2d 210 (1990). The court first held that $ 2-7-111(b) was content based "because it regulates a specific

subject matter, the solicitation of votes and the display ordistribution of campaign materials, and a certain category of
speakers, campaign workers." Id., at 213. The court thenheld that such a content-based statute could not be upheld
unless (i) the burden placed on free speech rights is justified
by a compelling state interest and (ii) the means chosen bear
a substantial relation to that interest and are the least intrusive to achieve the State's goals. While the Tennessee Supreme Court found that the State unquestionably had shown
a compelling interest in banning solicitation of voters and
distribution of campaign materials within the polling place
itself, it concluded that the State had not shown a compelling
interest in regulating the premises around the polling place.
Accordingly, the court held that the 100-foot limit was not
narrowly tailored to protect the demonstrated interest.
The court also held that the statute was not the least restrictive means to serve the State's interests. The court found
less restrictive the current Tennessee statutes prohibiting
interference with an election or the use of violence or intimidation to prevent voting. See Tenn. Code Ann. $$ 2-19-101
and 2-19-115 (Supp. 1991). Finally, the court noted that if
the State were able to show a compelling interest in preventing congestion and disruption at the entrances to polling
places, a shorter radius "might perhaps pass constitutional
muster." 802 S. W. 2d, at 214.

Because of the importance of the issue, we granted certiorari. 499 U. S. 958 (1991). We now reverse the Tennessee
Supreme Court's judgment that the statute violates the
First Amendment of the United States Constitution.

Opinion of Blackmun, J.

III
The First Amendment provides that "Congress shall makeno law . . . abridging the freedom of speech . . . ." This

Court in Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88, 95 (1940), said:"The freedom of speech . . . which [is] secured by the First
Amendment against abridgment by the United States, [is]among the fundamental personal rights and liberties which
are secured to all persons by the Fourteenth Amendmentagainst abridgment by a State."

The Tennessee statute implicates three central concerns inour First Amendment jurisprudence: regulation of political
speech, regulation of speech in a public forum, and regulationbased on the content of the speech. The speech restricted
by $ 2-7-111(b) obviously is political speech. "Whatever dif-ferences may exist about interpretations of the First Amendment, there is practically universal agreement that a majorpurpose of that Amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs." Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S.,at 218. "For speech concerning public affairs is more than
self-expression; it is the essence of self-government." Gar-rison v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 64, 74-75 (1964). Accordingly,
this Court has recognized that "the First Amendment `hasits fullest and most urgent application' to speech uttered during a campaign for political office." Eu v. San FranciscoCty. Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 223 (1989)
(quoting Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U. S. 265, 272(1971)).

The second important feature of $ 2-7-111(b) is that it barsspeech in quintessential public forums. These forums include those places "which by long tradition or by governmentfiat have been devoted to assembly and debate," such as
parks, streets, and sidewalks. Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry
Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37, 45 (1983).2 "Such use

the campaign-free zone included sidewalks and streets adjacent to the polling places. See App. 23-24, 42. See also 802 S. W. 2d 210, 213 (1990).

of the streets and public places has, from ancient times, beena part of the privileges, immunities, rights, and liberties of

citizens." Hague v. CIO, 307 U. S. 496, 515 (1939) (opinionof Roberts, J.). At the same time, however, expressive activity, even in a quintessential public forum, may interferewith other important activities for which the property is
used. Accordingly, this Court has held that the governmentmay regulate the time, place, and manner of the expressive
activity, so long as such restrictions are content neutral, arenarrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and leave open ample alternatives for communication.
United States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 177 (1983). See also
Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989).The Tennessee restriction under consideration, however,

is not a facially content-neutral time, place, or mannerrestriction. Whether individuals may exercise their free
speech rights near polling places depends entirely onwhether their speech is related to a political campaign. The
statute does not reach other categories of speech, suchas commercial solicitation, distribution, and display. This
Court has held that the First Amendment's hostility tocontent-based regulation extends not only to a restriction
on a particular viewpoint, but also to a prohibition of publicdiscussion of an entire topic. See,

e. g., Consolidated Edi-son Co. of N. Y. v. Public Service Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S.

530, 537 (1980). Accord, Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members
of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 116 (1991)(statute restricting speech about crime is content based).

3 Content-based restrictions also have been held to raise Fourteenth
Amendment equal protection concerns because, in the course of regulating
speech, such restrictions differentiate between types of speech. See Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92 (1972) (exemption of labor
picketing from ban on picketing near schools violates Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection). See also City Council of Los Angeles

As a facially content-based restriction on political speechin a public forum, $ 2-7-111(b) must be subjected to exacting

scrutiny: The State must show that the "regulation is neces-sary to serve a compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end." Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry

Grace, 461 U. S., at 177.Despite the ritualistic ease with which we state this nowfamiliar standard, its announcement does not allow us toavoid the truly difficult issues involving the First Amendment. Perhaps foremost among these serious issues arecases that force us to reconcile our commitment to free
speech with our commitment to other constitutional rightsembodied in government proceedings. See,

e. g., Sheppardv. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333, 361-363 (1966) (outlining restrictions on speech of trial participants that courts may imposeto protect an accused's right to a fair trial). This case presents us with a particularly difficult reconciliation: the ac-commodation of the right to engage in political discourse
with the right to vote--a right at the heart of our democracy.

tion). Under either a free speech or equal protection theory, a contentbased regulation of political speech in a public forum is valid only if it can
survive strict scrutiny. Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 461-462 (1980).

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
Second, Tennessee argues that its restriction protects theright to vote in an election conducted with integrity and

reliability.5The interests advanced by Tennessee obviously are compelling ones. This Court has recognized that the "right tovote freely for the candidate of one's choice is of the essence
of a democratic society." Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533,555 (1964). Indeed,

"[n]o right is more precious in a free country than thatof having a voice in the election of those who make the
laws under which, as good citizens, we must live. Otherrights, even the most basic, are illusory if the right to
vote is undermined." Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U. S. 1,17 (1964).

Accordingly, this Court has concluded that a State has a com-pelling interest in protecting voters from confusion and
undue influence. See Eu, 489 U. S., at 228-229.The Court also has recognized that a State "indisputably
has a compelling interest in preserving the integrity of itselection process." Id., at 231. The Court thus has "upheld
generally applicable and evenhanded restrictions that pro-tect the integrity and reliability of the electoral process itself." Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 788, n. 9 (1983)(collecting cases). In other words, it has recognized that a
State has a compelling interest in ensuring that an individu-al's right to vote is not undermined by fraud in the election
process.To survive strict scrutiny, however, a State must do more
than assert a compelling state interest--it must demonstratethat its law is necessary to serve the asserted interest.

200 BURSON v. FREEMAN

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
While we readily acknowledge that a law rarely survives
such scrutiny, an examination of the evolution of election
reform, both in this country and abroad, demonstrates the
necessity of restricted areas in or around polling places.

During the colonial period, many government officials
were elected by the viva voce method or by the showing of
hands, as was the custom in most parts of Europe. That
voting scheme was not a private affair, but an open, public
decision, witnessed by all and improperly influenced by
some. The opportunities that the viva voce system gave for
bribery and intimidation gradually led to its repeal. See
generally E. Evans, A History of the Australian Ballot System in the United States 1-6 (1917) (Evans); J. Harris, Election Administration in the United States 15-16 (1934) (Harris); J. Rusk, The Effect of the Australian Ballot Reform on
Split Ticket Voting: 1876-1908, pp. 8-11 (1968) (Rusk).

Within 20 years of the formation of the Union, most States
had incorporated the paper ballot into their electoral system.
Initially, this paper ballot was a vast improvement. Individual voters made their own handwritten ballots, marked them
in the privacy of their homes, and then brought them to the
polls for counting. But the effort of making out such a ballot
became increasingly more complex and cumbersome. See
generally S. Albright, The American Ballot 14-19 (1942)
(Albright); Evans 5; Rusk 9-14.

Wishing to gain influence, political parties began to
produce their own ballots for voters. These ballots were
often printed with flamboyant colors, distinctive designs, and
emblems so that they could be recognized at a distance.
State attempts to standardize the ballots were easily
thwarted--the vote buyer could simply place a ballot in the
hands of the bribed voter and watch until he placed it in the
polling box. Thus, the evils associated with the earlier viva
voce system reinfected the election process; the failure of

201Cite as: 504 U. S. 191 (1992)

the law to secure secrecy opened the door to bribery 6 and
intimidation.7 See generally Albright 19-20; Evans 7, 11;
Harris 17, 151-152; V. Key, Politics, Parties, and Pressure
Groups 649 (1952); J. Reynolds, Testing Democracy: Electoral
Behavior and Progressive Reform in New Jersey, 1880-1920,
p. 36 (1988); Rusk 14-23.

6 One writer described the conditions as follows:
"This sounds like exaggeration, but it is truth; and these are facts so
notorious that no one acquainted with the conduct of recent elections now
attempts a denial--that the raising of colossal sums for the purpose of
bribery has been rewarded by promotion to the highest offices in the
Government; that systematic organization for the purchase of votes, individually and in blocks, at the polls, has become a recognized factor in the
machinery of the parties; that the number of voters who demand money
compensation for their ballots has grown greater with each recurring election." J. Gordon, The Protection of Suffrage 13 (1891) (quoted in Evans
11).

Evans reports that the bribery of voters in Indiana in 1880 and 1888
was sufficient to determine the results of the election and that "[m]any
electors, aware that the corrupt element was large enough to be able to
turn the election, held aloof altogether." Ibid.

7 According to a report of a committee of the 46th Congress, men were

frequently marched or carried to the polls in their employers' carriages.
They were then furnished with ballots and compelled to hold their hands
up with their ballots in them so they could easily be watched until the
ballots were dropped into the box. S. Rep. No. 497, 46th Cong., 2d Sess.,
9-10 (1880).

Evans recounted that intimidation, particularly by employers, was "extensively practiced":

"Many labor men were afraid to vote and remained away from the polls.
Others who voted against their employers' wishes frequently lost their
jobs. If the employee lived in a factory town, he probably lived in a tenement owned by the company, and possibly his wife and children worked in
the mill. If he voted against the wishes of the mill-owners, he and his
family were thrown out of the mill, out of the tenement, and out of the
means of earning a livelihood. Frequently the owner and the manager of
the mill stood at the entrance of the polling-place and closely observed the
employees while they voted. In this condition, it cannot be said that the
workingmen exercised any real choice." Evans 12-13 (footnote omitted).

202 BURSON v. FREEMAN

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
Approaching the polling place under this system was akinto entering an open auction place. As the elector started

his journey to the polls, he was met by various party ticketpeddlers "who were only too anxious to supply him with
their party tickets." Evans 9. Often the competition became heated when several such peddlers found an uncom-mitted or wavering voter. See L. Fredman, The Australian Ballot: The Story of an American Reform 24 (1968)(Fredman); Rusk 17. Sham battles were frequently engaged in to keep away elderly and timid voters of the opposi-tion. See Fredman 24, 26-27; 143 North American Review
628-629 (1886) (cited in Evans 16). In short, these early
elections "were not a very pleasant spectacle for those who
believed in democratic government." Id., at 10.

The problems with voter intimidation and election fraud
that the United States was experiencing were not unique.
Several other countries were attempting to work out satisfactory solutions to these same problems. Some Australian
provinces adopted a series of reforms intended to secure the
secrecy of an elector's vote. The most famous feature of the
Australian system was its provision for an official ballot, encompassing all candidates of all parties on the same ticket.
But this was not the only measure adopted to preserve the
secrecy of the ballot. The Australian system also provided
for the erection of polling booths (containing several voting
compartments) open only to election officials, two "scrutinees" for each candidate, and electors about to vote. See J.
Wigmore, The Australian Ballot System as Embodied in the
Legislation of Various Countries 69, 71, 78, 79 (1889) (Wigmore) (excerpting provisions adopted by South Australia and
Queensland). See generally Albright 23; Evans 17; Rusk
23-24.

The Australian system was enacted in England in 1872
after a study by the committee of election practices identified
Australia's ballot as the best possible remedy for the existing situation. See Wigmore 14-16. Belgium followed Eng504us1$74L 04-04-96 21:25:19 PAGES OPINPGT

land's example in 1877. Like the Australian provinces, bothEngland and Belgium excluded the general public from the

entire polling room. See Wigmore 94, 105. See generallyAlbright 23-24; Evans 17-18; Rusk 24-25.

One of the earliest indications of the reform movement
in this country came in 1882 when the Philadelphia CivilService Reform Association urged its adoption in a pamphlet

entitled "English Elections." Many articles were writtenpraising its usefulness in preventing bribery, intimidation,
disorder, and inefficiency at the polls. Commentators ar-gued that it would diminish the growing evil of bribery by
removing the knowledge of whether it had been successful.
Another argument strongly urged in favor of the reform was
that it would protect the weak and dependent against intimidation and coercion by employers and creditors. The inability to determine the effectiveness of bribery and intimidation
accordingly would create order and decency at the polls.
See generally Albright 24-26; Evans 21-23; Rusk 25-29,
42-43.

After several failed attempts to adopt the Australian system in Michigan and Wisconsin, the Louisville, Kentucky,
municipal government, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
and the State of New York adopted the Australian system in
1888. The Louisville law prohibited all but voters, candidates or their agents, and electors from coming within 50
feet of the voting room inclosure. The Louisville law also
provided that candidates' agents within the restricted area
"were not allowed to persuade, influence, or intimidate any
one in the choice of his candidate, or to attempt doing
so . . . ." Wigmore 120. The Massachusetts and New York
laws differed somewhat from the previous Acts in that they
excluded the general public only from the area encompassed
within a guardrail constructed six feet from the voting compartments. See id., at 47, 128. This modification was considered an improvement because it provided additional monitoring by members of the general public and independent

candidates, who in most States were not allowed to be repre-sented by separate inspectors. Otherwise, "in order to perpetrate almost every election fraud it would only be neces-sary to buy up the election officers of the other party." Id.,
at 52. Finally, New York also prohibited any person from"electioneering on election day within any polling-place, or
within one hundred feet of any polling place." Id., at 131.See generally Evans 18-21; Rusk 26.

The success achieved through these reforms was imme-diately noticed and widely praised. See generally Evans
21-24; Rusk 26-31, 42-43. One commentator remarked ofthe New York law of 1888:

"We have secured secrecy; and intimidation by em-ployers, party bosses, police officers, saloonkeepers and
others has come to an end."In earlier times our polling places were frequently,
to quote the litany, `scenes of battle, murder, and suddendeath.' This also has come to an end, and until nightfall, when the jubilation begins, our election days arenow as peaceful as our Sabbaths.

"The new legislation has also rendered impossible theold methods of frank, hardy, straightforward and shameless bribery of voters at the polls." W. Ivins, The Elec-toral System of the State of New York, Proceedings of
the 29th Annual Meeting of the New York State BarAssociation 316 (1906).

The triumphs of 1888 set off a rapid and widespread adop-tion of the Australian system in the United States. By 1896,

8 Similar results were achieved with the Massachusetts law:
"Quiet, order, and cleanliness reign in and about the polling-places. I
have visited precincts where, under the old system, coats were torn off
the backs of voters, where ballots of one kind have been snatched from
voters' hands and others put in their places, with threats against using
any but the substituted ballots; and under the new system all was orderly
and peaceable." 2 Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social
Science 738 (1892).

almost 90 percent of the States had adopted the Australiansystem. This accounted for 92 percent of the national electorate. See Rusk 30-31. See also Albright 26-28; Evans27;

post, at 215, n. 1 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment)
(citations to statutes passed before 1900).

The roots of Tennessee's regulation can be traced back totwo provisions passed during this period of rapid reform.

Tennessee passed the first relevant provision in 1890 as partof its switch to an Australian system. In its effort to "secur[e] the purity of elections," Tennessee provided that onlyvoters and certain election officials were permitted within
the room where the election was held or within 50 feet of
the entrance. The Act did not provide any penalty for violation and applied only in the more highly populated counties
and cities. 1890 Tenn. Pub. Acts, ch. 24, $$ 12 and 13.

The second relevant provision was passed in 1901 as an
amendment to Tennessee's "Act to preserve the purity of
elections, and define and punish offenses against the elective
franchise." The original Act, passed in 1897, made it a misdemeanor to commit various election offenses, including the
use of bribery, violence, or intimidation in order to induce a
person to vote or refrain from voting for any particular person or measure. 1897 Tenn. Pub. Acts, ch. 14. The 1901
amendment made it a misdemeanor for any person, except
the officers holding the elections, to approach nearer than 30
feet to any voter or ballot box. This provision applied to all
Tennessee elections. 1901 Tenn. Pub. Acts, ch. 142.

These two laws remained relatively unchanged until 1967,
when Tennessee added yet another proscription to its secret
ballot law. This amendment prohibited the distribution of
campaign literature "on the same floor of a building, or
within one hundred (100) feet thereof, where an election is
in progress." 1967 Tenn. Pub. Acts, ch. 85.

In 1972, the State enacted a comprehensive code to regulate the conduct of elections. The code included a section
that proscribed the display and the distribution of campaign

material and the solicitation of votes within 100 feet of theentrance to a polling place. The 1972 "campaign-free zone"

is the direct precursor of the restriction challenged in thepresent litigation.

Today, all 50 States limit access to the areas in or aroundpolling places. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a-50a; Note,
Defoliating the Grassroots: Election Day Restrictions on Po-litical Speech, 77 Geo. L. J. 2137 (1989) (summarizing statutes
as of 1989). The National Labor Relations Board also limitsactivities at or near polling places in union-representation
elections.9In sum, an examination of the history of election regulation in this country reveals a persistent battle against twoevils: voter intimidation and election fraud. After an unsuccessful experiment with an unofficial ballot system, all 50States, together with numerous other Western democracies,
settled on the same solution: a secret ballot secured in partby a restricted zone around the voting compartments. We
find that this widespread and time-tested consensus demon-strates that some restricted zone is necessary in order to
serve the States' compelling interests in preventing voterintimidation and election fraud.

Respondent and the dissent advance three principal chal-lenges to this conclusion. First, respondent argues that restricted zones are overinclusive because States could securethese same compelling interests with statutes that make it a
misdemeanor to interfere with an election or to use violenceor intimidation to prevent voting. See,

e. g., Tenn. CodeAnn. $$ 2-19-101 and 2-19-115 (Supp. 1991). We are not

persuaded. Intimidation and interference laws fall short ofserving a State's compelling interests because they "deal

with only the most blatant and specific attempts" to impedeelections. Cf.

Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 28 (1976) (existence of bribery statute does not preclude need for limits oncontributions to political campaigns). Moreover, because

law enforcement officers generally are barred from the vicinity of the polls to avoid any appearance of coercion in theelectoral process, see Tenn. Code Ann. $ 2-7-103 (1985),

many acts of interference would go undetected. These un-detected or less than blatant acts may nonetheless drive the
voter away before remedial action can be taken.Second, respondent and the dissent argue that Tennessee's
statute is underinclusive because it does not restrict other
types of speech, such as charitable and commercial solicitation or exit polling, within the 100-foot zone. We agree that
distinguishing among types of speech requires that the statute be subjected to strict scrutiny. We do not, however,
agree that the failure to regulate all speech renders the statute fatally underinclusive. In fact, as one early commentator pointed out, allowing members of the general public access to the polling place makes it more difficult for political
machines to buy off all the monitors. See Wigmore 52.
But regardless of the need for such additional monitoring,
there is, as summarized above, ample evidence that political
candidates have used campaign workers to commit voter intimidation or electoral fraud. In contrast, there is simply
no evidence that political candidates have used other forms
of solicitation or exit polling to commit such electoral abuses.
States adopt laws to address the problems that confront
them. The First Amendment does not require States to
regulate for problems that do not exist.

Finally, the dissent argues that we confuse history with
necessity. Yet the dissent concedes that a secret ballot was
necessary to cure electoral abuses. Contrary to the dissent's contention, the link between ballot secrecy and some
restricted zone surrounding the voting area is not merely
timing--it is common sense. The only way to preserve the

504us1$74L 04-04-96 21:25:19 PAGES OPINPGT
208 BURSON v. FREEMAN

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
secrecy of the ballot is to limit access to the area around
the voter.10 Accordingly, we hold that some restricted zone
around the voting area is necessary to secure the State's
compelling interest.

The real question then is how large a restricted zone is
permissible or sufficiently tailored. Respondent and the dissent argue that Tennessee's 100-foot boundary is not narrowly drawn to achieve the State's compelling interest in
protecting the right to vote. We disagree.

As a preliminary matter, the long, uninterrupted, and
prevalent use of these statutes makes it difficult for States
to come forward with the sort of proof the dissent wishes to
require. The majority of these laws were adopted originally
in the 1890's, long before States engaged in extensive legislative hearings on election regulations. The prevalence of
these laws, both here and abroad, then encouraged their reenactment without much comment. The fact that these laws
have been in effect for a long period of time also makes it
difficult for the States to put on witnesses who can testify as
to what would happen without them. Finally, it is difficult
to isolate the exact effect of these laws on voter intimidation
and election fraud. Voter intimidation and election fraud
are successful precisely because they are difficult to detect.

Furthermore, because a government has such a compelling
interest in securing the right to vote freely and effectively,
this Court never has held a State "to the burden of demonstrating empirically the objective effects on political stability
that [are] produced" by the voting regulation in question.

10 The logical connection between ballot secrecy and restricted zones
distinguishes this case from those cited by the dissent in which the Court
struck down longstanding election regulations. In those cases, there was
no rational connection between the asserted interest and the regulation.
See, e. g., Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663, 666 (1966)
("Voter qualifications have no relation to wealth nor to paying or not paying this or any other tax").

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U. S. 189, 195 (1986).11Elections vary from year to year, and place to place. It is

therefore difficult to make specific findings about the effectsof a voting regulation. Moreover, the remedy for a tainted
election is an imperfect one. Rerunning an election would
have a negative impact on voter turnout.12 Thus, requiringproof that a 100-foot boundary is perfectly tailored to deal

with voter intimidation and election fraud

"would necessitate that a State's political system sustainsome level of damage before the legislature could take

corrective action. Legislatures, we think, should be
permitted to respond to potential deficiencies in the electoral process with foresight rather than reactively, provided that the response is reasonable and does not significantly impinge on constitutionally protected rights."
Id., at 195-196 (emphasis added).

11 This modified "burden of proof" does not apply to all cases in which
there is a conflict between First Amendment rights and a State's election
process--instead, it applies only when the First Amendment right threatens to interfere with the act of voting itself, i. e., cases involving voter
confusion from overcrowded ballots, like Munro, or cases such as this one,
in which the challenged activity physically interferes with electors attempting to cast their ballots. Thus, for example, States must come forward with more specific findings to support regulations directed at intangible "influence," such as the ban on election-day editorials struck down
in Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S. 214 (1966).

12 The dissent argues that our unwillingness to require more specific

findings is in tension with Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333 (1966), another case in which there was conflict between two constitutional rights.
Trials do not, however, present the same evidentiary or remedial problems. Because the judge is concerned only with the trial before him, it is
much easier to make specific findings. And while the remedy of rerunning a trial is an onerous one, it does not suffer from the imperfections of
a rescheduled election. Nonetheless, even in the fair trial context, we
reaffirmed that, given the importance of the countervailing right, " `our
system of law has always endeavored to prevent even the probability of
unfairness.' " Id., at 352 (quoting In re Murchison, 349 U. S. 133, 136
(1955)) (emphasis added).

210 BURSON v. FREEMAN

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
We do not think that the minor geographic limitationprescribed by $ 2-7-111(b) constitutes such a significant

impingement. Thus, we simply do not view the questionwhether the 100-foot boundary line could be somewhat
tighter as a question of "constitutional dimension." Id., at197. Reducing the boundary to 25 feet, as suggested by the
Tennessee Supreme Court, 802 S. W. 2d, at 214, is a differ-ence only in degree, not a less restrictive alternative in kind.
Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 30. As was pointed out inthe dissenting opinion in the Tennessee Supreme Court, it
"takes approximately 15 seconds to walk 75 feet." 802S. W. 2d, at 215. The State of Tennessee has decided that
these last 15 seconds before its citizens enter the pollingplace should be their own, as free from interference as possible. We do not find that this is an unconstitutional choice.13At some measurable distance from the polls, of course,
governmental regulation of vote solicitation could effectivelybecome an impermissible burden akin to the statute struck
down in Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S. 214 (1966). See alsoMeyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414 (1988) (invalidating absolute
bar against the use of paid circulators). In reviewing chal-lenges to specific provisions of a State's election laws, however, this Court has not employed any " `litmus-paper test'

13 Respondent also raises two more specific challenges to the tailoring of
the Tennessee statute. First, she contends that there may be some polling places so situated that the 100-foot boundary falls in or on the other
side of a highway. Second, respondent argues that the inclusion of quintessential public forums in some campaign-free zones could result in the
prosecution of an individual for driving by in an automobile with a campaign bumper sticker. At oral argument, petitioner denied that the statute would reach this latter, inadvertent conduct, since this would not constitute "display" of campaign material. Tr. of Oral Arg. 33-35. In any
event, these arguments are "as applied" challenges that should be made by
an individual prosecuted for such conduct. If successful, these challenges
would call for a limiting construction rather than a facial invalidation. In
the absence of any factual record to support respondent's contention that
the statute has been applied to reach such circumstances, we do not entertain the challenges in this case.

that will separate valid from invalid restrictions." Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S., at 789 (quoting Storer v. Brown,
415 U. S. 724, 730 (1974)). Accordingly, it is sufficient to say
that in establishing a 100-foot boundary, Tennessee is on the
constitutional side of the line.

In conclusion, we reaffirm that it is the rare case in which
we have held that a law survives strict scrutiny. This, however, is such a rare case. Here, the State, as recognized administrator of elections, has asserted that the exercise of free
speech rights conflicts with another fundamental right, the
right to cast a ballot in an election free from the taint of
intimidation and fraud. A long history, a substantial consensus, and simple common sense show that some restricted
zone around polling places is necessary to protect that fundamental right. Given the conflict between these two rights,
we hold that requiring solicitors to stand 100 feet from the
entrances to polling places does not constitute an unconstitutional compromise.

The judgment of the Tennessee Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Thomas took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.

Justice Kennedy, concurring.
Earlier this Term, I questioned the validity of the Court's
recent First Amendment precedents suggesting that a State
may restrict speech based on its content in the pursuit of a
compelling interest. Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of
N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 124-125 (1991)
(opinion concurring in judgment). Under what I deem the
proper approach, neither a general content-based proscription of speech nor a content-based proscription of speech in
a public forum can be justified unless the speech falls within

Kennedy, J., concurring
one of a limited set of well-defined categories. See ibid. To-day's case warrants some elaboration on the meaning of the

term "content based" as used in our jurisprudence.In

Simon & Schuster, my concurrence pointed out the
seeming paradox that notwithstanding "our repeated statement that `above all else, the First Amendment means thatgovernment has no power to restrict expression because of

its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content,' " id.,at 126 (quoting

Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S.
92, 95 (1972)), we had fallen into the practice of suggestingthat content-based limits on speech can be upheld if confined

in a narrow way to serve a compelling state interest. I continue to believe that our adoption of the compelling-interest
test was accomplished by accident, 502 U. S., at 125, and
as a general matter produces a misunderstanding that has
the potential to encourage attempts to suppress legitimate
expression.

The test may have a legitimate role, however, in sorting
out what is and what is not a content-based restriction. See
id., at 128 ("[W]e cannot avoid the necessity of deciding . . .
whether the regulation is in fact content based or content
neutral"). As the Court has recognized in the context of
regulations of the time, place, or manner of speech, "[g]overnment regulation of expressive activity is content neutral
so long as it is `justified without reference to the content
of the regulated speech.' " Ward v. Rock Against Racism,
491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989) (quoting Clark v. Community for
Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 293 (1984)) (emphasis
added in Ward). In some cases, the fact that a regulation
is content based and invalid because outside any recognized
category permitting suppression will be apparent from its
face. In my view that was true of the New York statute we
considered in Simon & Schuster, and no further inquiry was
necessary. To read the statute was sufficient to strike it
down as an effort by government to restrict expression because of its content.

Discerning the justification for a restriction of expression,however, is not always so straightforward as it was, or

should have been, in Simon & Schuster. In some cases, acensorial justification will not be apparent from the face of a
regulation which draws distinctions based on content, and
the government will tender a plausible justification unrelatedto the suppression of speech or ideas. There the compellinginterest test may be one analytical device to detect, in anobjective way, whether the asserted justification is in fact an
accurate description of the purpose and effect of the law.This explanation of the compelling-interest analysis is not
explicit in our decisions; yet it does appear that in time,
place, and manner cases, the regulation's justification is a
central inquiry. See, e. g., Ward v. Rock Against Racism,
supra, at 791; Clark v. Community for Creative NonViolence, supra, at 293; Heffron v. International Society for
Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U. S. 640, 648-649, and
n. 12 (1981). And in those matters we do not apply as strict
a requirement of narrow tailoring as in other contexts, Ward
v. Rock Against Racism, supra, at 797, although this may
be because in cases like Ward, Clark, and Heffron, content
neutrality was evident on the face of the regulations once
the justification was identified and became itself the object
of examination.

The same use of the compelling-interest test is adopted
today, not to justify or condemn a category of suppression
but to determine the accuracy of the justification the State
gives for its law. The outcome of that analysis is that the
justification for the speech restriction is to protect another
constitutional right. As I noted in Simon & Schuster, there
is a narrow area in which the First Amendment permits freedom of expression to yield to the extent necessary for the
accommodation of another constitutional right. 502 U. S., at
124, 128. That principle can apply here without danger that
the general rule permitting no content restriction will be
engulfed by the analysis; for under the statute the State acts

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
to protect the integrity of the polling place where citizensexercise the right to vote. Voting is one of the most fundamental and cherished liberties in our democratic system ofgovernment. The State is not using this justification to
suppress legitimate expression. With these observations, I
concur in the opinion of Justice Blackmun and the judg-ment of the Court.

Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment.
If the category of "traditional public forum" is to be a toolof analysis rather than a conclusory label, it must remain

faithful to its name and derive its content from tradition.Because restrictions on speech around polling places on election day are as venerable a part of the American traditionas the secret ballot, Tenn. Code Ann. $ 2-7-111 (Supp. 1991)
does not restrict speech in a traditional public forum, and
the "exacting scrutiny" that the plurality purports to apply,
ante, at 198, is inappropriate. Instead, I believe that $ 2-7-
111, though content based, is constitutional because it is
a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral regulation of a nonpublic
forum. I therefore concur in the judgment of the Court.

As the plurality correctly notes, the 100-foot zone established by $ 2-7-111 sometimes encompasses streets and sidewalks adjacent to the polling places. Ante, at 196, n. 2.
The plurality's determination that $ 2-7-111 is subject to
strict scrutiny is premised on its view that these areas are
"quintessential public forums," having " `by long tradition
. . . been devoted to assembly and debate.' " Ante, at 196
(emphasis added). Insofar as areas adjacent to functioning
polling places are concerned, that is simply not so. Statutes
such as $ 2-7-111 have an impressively long history of general use. Ever since the widespread adoption of the secret
ballot in the late 19th century, viewpoint-neutral restrictions
on election-day speech within a specified distance of the polling place--or on physical presence there--have been commonplace, indeed prevalent. By 1900, at least 34 of the 45

stricted zones often encompassed streets and sidewalks.
Thus, the streets and sidewalks around polling places have
traditionally not been devoted to assembly and debate.

Nothing in the public forum doctrine or in this Court's
precedents warrants disregard of this longstanding tradition.
"Streets and sidewalks" are not public forums in all places,
see Greer v. Spock, 424 U. S. 828 (1976) (streets and sidewalks on military base are not a public forum), and the long
usage of our people demonstrates that the portions of streets
and sidewalks adjacent to polling places are not public forums at all times either. This unquestionable tradition
could be accommodated, I suppose, by holding laws such as

$ 2-7-111 to be covered by our doctrine of permissible "time,
place, and manner" restrictions upon public forum speech--
which doctrine is itself no more than a reflection of our traditions, see Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn.,
460 U. S. 37, 45 (1983). The problem with this approach,
however, is that it would require some expansion of (or a
unique exception to) the "time, place, and manner" doctrine,
which does not permit restrictions that are not content neutral ($ 2-7-111 prohibits only electioneering speech). Ibid.
It is doctrinally less confusing to acknowledge that the environs of a polling place, on election day, are simply not a "traditional public forum"--which means that they are subject
to speech restrictions that are reasonable and viewpoint neutral. Id., at 46.

For the reasons that the plurality believes $ 2-7-111 survives exacting scrutiny, ante, at 198-211, I believe it is at
least reasonable; and respondent does not contend that it is
viewpoint discriminatory. I therefore agree with the judgment of the Court that $ 2-7-111 is constitutional.

The speech and conduct prohibited in the campaign-freezone created by Tenn. Code Ann. $ 2-7-111 (Supp. 1991) is

classic political expression. As this Court has long recog-nized, "[d]iscussion of public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are integral to the operation of thesystem of government established by our Constitution. The
First Amendment affords the broadest protection to such po-litical expression in order `to assure [the] unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and socialchanges desired by the people.' "

Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S.1, 14 (1976) (citation omitted). Therefore, I fully agree with

the plurality that Tennessee must show that its " `regulationis necessary to serve a compelling state interest and that it
is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.' " Ante, at 198 (cita-tions omitted). I do not agree, however, that Tennessee has
made anything approaching such a showing.

I
Tennessee's statutory "campaign-free zone" raises consti-tutional concerns of the first magnitude. The statute directly regulates political expression and thus implicates acore concern of the First Amendment. Moreover, it targets
only a specific subject matter (campaign speech) and a de-fined class of speakers (campaign workers) and thus regulates expression based on its content. In doing so, the Ten-nessee statute somewhat perversely disfavors speech that
normally is accorded greater protection than the kinds ofspeech that the statute does not regulate. For these reasons, Tennessee unquestionably bears the heavy burden ofdemonstrating that its silencing of political expression is
necessary and narrowly tailored to serve a compelling stateinterest.

Statutes creating campaign-free zones outside pollingplaces serve two quite different functions--they protect or504us1$74L 04-04-96 21:25:19 PAGES OPINPGT

Stevens, J., dissenting
derly access to the polls and they prevent last-minute cam-paigning. There can be no question that the former constitutes a compelling state interest and that, in light ofour decision in

Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S. 214 (1966), the
latter does not. Accordingly, a State must demonstrate that
the particular means it has fashioned to ensure orderly ac-cess to the polls do not unnecessarily hinder last-minute

campaigning.Campaign-free zones are noteworthy for their broad, antiseptic sweep. The Tennessee zone encompasses at least30,000 square feet around each polling place; in some States,
such as Kentucky and Wisconsin, the radius of the restricted
zone is 500 feet--silencing an area of over 750,000 square
feet. Even under the most sanguine scenario of participatory democracy, it is difficult to imagine voter turnout so
complete as to require the clearing of hundreds of thousands
of square feet simply to ensure that the path to the pollingplace door remains open and that the curtain that protects
the secrecy of the ballot box remains closed.

The fact that campaign-free zones cover such a large area
in some States unmistakably identifies censorship of electionday campaigning as an animating force behind these restrictions. That some States have no problem maintaining order
with zones of 50 feet or less strongly suggests that the more
expansive prohibitions are not necessary to maintain access
and order. Indeed, on its face, Tennessee's statute appears
informed by political concerns. Although the statute initially established a 100-foot zone, it was later amended to
establish a 300-foot zone in 12 of the State's 95 counties. As
the State Attorney General observed, "there is not a rational
basis" for this special treatment, for there is no "discernable
reason why an extension of the boundary . . . is necessary
in" those 12 counties. Brief in Opposition 4a, Tenn. Op.

Moreover, the Tennessee statute does not merely regulate conduct that might inhibit voting; it bars the simple

"display of campaign posters, signs, or other campaign mate-rials." $ 2-7-111(b). Bumper stickers on parked cars and

lapel buttons on pedestrians are taboo. The notion that suchsweeping restrictions on speech are necessary to maintain
the freedom to vote and the integrity of the ballot box bor-ders on the absurd.

The evidence introduced at trial to demonstrate the neces-sity for Tennessee's campaign-free zone was exceptionally
thin. Although the State's sole witness explained the needfor special restrictions

inside the polling place itself, she of-fered no justification for a ban on political expression outside

the polling place.1 On this record it is far from surprisingthat the Tennessee Supreme Court--which surely is more
familiar with the State's electoral practices and traditionsthan we are--concluded that the 100-foot ban outside the
polling place was not justified by regulatory concerns. This
conclusion is bolstered by Tennessee law, which indicatesthat normal police protection is completely adequate to maintain order in the area more than 10 feet from the pollingplace.

2

Perhaps in recognition of the poverty of the record, theplurality--without briefing, or legislative or judicial factfinding--looks to history to assess whether Tennessee's stat1 See 802 S. W. 2d 210, 213 (Tenn. 1990) ("The specific testimony of the
State's witness about confusion, error, overcrowding, etc. concerned the
numbers of persons present in the polling place itself, not the numbers of
persons outside the polls").

2 Within the polling place itself, and within 10 feet of its entrance, a

prohibition against the presence of nonvoters is justified, in part by the
absence of normal police protection. Section 2-7-103(c) provides:

"No policeman or other law-enforcement officer may come nearer to the
entrance to a polling place than ten feet (10*) or enter the polling place
except at the request of the officer of elections or the county election
commission or to make an arrest or to vote."

There is, however, no reason to believe that the Tennessee Legislature
regarded the normal protection against disruptive conduct outside that
10-foot area as insufficient to guarantee orderly access.

ute is in fact necessary to serve the State's interests. Fromits review of the history of electoral reform, the plurality

finds that

"all 50 States . . . settled on the same solution: a secretballot secured in part by a restricted zone around the

voting compartments. We find that this widespreadand time-tested consensus demonstrates that some restricted zone is necessary in order to serve the States'compelling interest in preventing voter intimidation and

election fraud." Ante, at 206 (emphasis added).
This analysis is deeply flawed; it confuses history withnecessity, and mistakes the traditional for the indispensable.

The plurality's reasoning combines two logical errors: First,the plurality assumes that a practice's long life itself establishes its necessity; and second, the plurality assumes that apractice that was once necessary remains necessary until it
is ended.3With regard to the first, the fact that campaign-free zones
were, as the plurality indicates, introduced as part of abroader package of electoral reforms does not demonstrate
that such zones were necessary. The abuses that affectedthe electoral system could have been cured by the institution
of the secret ballot and by the heightened regulation of thepolling place alone, without silencing the political speech outside the polling place.4 In my opinion, more than mere tim-ing is required to infer necessity from tradition.

3 I leave it to historians to review the substantive accuracy of the plurality's narrative, for I find more disturbing the plurality's use of history.

4 The plurality's suggestion that "[t]he only way to preserve the secrecy

of the ballot is to limit access to the area around the voter," ante, at
207-208, is specious. First, there are obvious and simple means of preserving voter secrecy (e. g., opaque doors or curtains on the voting booth)
that do not involve the suppression of political speech. Second, there is
no disagreement that the restrictions on campaigning within the polling
place are constitutional; the issue is not whether the State may limit access to the "area around the voter" but whether the State may limit speech
in the area around the polling place.

We have never regarded tradition as a proxy for necessitywhere necessity must be demonstrated. To the contrary,

our election-law jurisprudence is rich with examples of tradi-tions that, though longstanding, were later held to be unnecessary. For example, "[m]ost of the early Colonies had [poll
taxes]; many of the States have had them during much oftheir histories . . . ."

Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections,
383 U. S. 663, 684 (1966) (Harlan, J., dissenting). Similarly,substantial barriers to candidacy, such as stringent petition

requirements, see Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U. S. 23 (1968),property-ownership requirements, see

Turner v. Fouche, 396
U. S. 346 (1970), and onerous filing fees, see Lubin v. Panish,
415 U. S. 709 (1974), were all longstanding features of the
electoral labyrinth.

In fact, two of our most noted decisions in this area involve, as does this case, Tennessee's electoral traditions.
Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U. S. 330 (1972), which invalidated
Tennessee's 1-year residency requirement, is particularly instructive. Tennessee's residency requirement was indisputably "traditional," having been in place since 1870. App. in
Dunn v. Blumstein, O. T. 1971, No. 13, p. 22. As in this
case, the State defended its law on the basis of its interest
in " `secur[ing] the freedom of elections and the purity of the
ballot box.' " Id., at 23. Again like this case, Dunn involved a conflict between two rights--the right to travel and
the right to vote. The Court applied strict scrutiny, ruling
that residency requirements are "unconstitutional unless the
State can demonstrate that such laws are `necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest.' " 405 U. S., at
342 (emphasis in original) (citation omitted). Although we
recognized that "[p]reservation of the `purity of the ballot
box' is a formidable-sounding state interest," id., at 345, we
rejected the State's argument that a 1-year requirement was
necessary to promote that interest. In doing so, we did not
even mention, let alone find determinative, the fact that Tennessee's requirement was more than 100 years old.

222 BURSON v. FREEMAN

Stevens, J., dissenting
In Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186 (1962), we addressed theapportionment of Tennessee's Legislature. The State's apportionment regime had remained unchanged since 1901 andwas such that, by the time of trial, "40% of the voters
elect[ed] 63 of the 99 members of the [state] House" of Representatives. Id., at 253 (Clark, J., concurring). Although, asJustice Frankfurter observed in dissent, " `very unequal' representation" had been a feature of the Nation's political land-scape since colonial times,

id., at 307-318, the Court was not
bound by this long tradition. Our other cases resemble
Dunn and Baker in this way: Never have we indicated that
tradition was synonymous with necessity.

Even if we assume that campaign-free zones were once
somehow "necessary," it would not follow that, 100 years
later, those practices remain necessary. Much in our political culture, institutions, and practices has changed since the
turn of the century: Our elections are far less corrupt, far
more civil, and far more democratic today than 100 years
ago. These salutary developments have substantially eliminated the need for what is, in my opinion, a sweeping suppression of core political speech.

Although the plurality today blithely dispenses with the
need for factual findings to determine the necessity of "traditional" restrictions on speech, courts that have made such
findings with regard to other campaign-free zones have,
without exception, found such zones unnecessary. See, e. g.,
Florida Comm. for Liability Reform v. McMillan, 682
F. Supp. 1536, 1541-1542 (MD Fla. 1988); Clean-Up '84 v.
Heinrich, 582 F. Supp. 125 (MD Fla. 1984), aff 'd, 759 F. 2d
1511 (CA11 1985). Likewise, courts that have invalidated
similar restrictions on so-called "exit polling" by the news
media have, after careful factfinding, also declined to find
such prohibitions "necessary." See, e. g., Firestone v. NewsPress Publishing Co., 538 So. 2d 457, 459 (Fla. 1989) (invalidating Florida's 50-foot zone to the extent that it reaches
outside the polling room and noting that "[a]t the evidentiary

hearing, no witnesses testified of any disturbances havingoccurred within fifty feet of the polling room. . . . The state's

unsubstantiated concern of potential disturbance is not suf-ficient to overcome the chilling effect on first amendment
rights"); Daily Herald Co. v. Munro, 838 F. 2d 380, 385, n. 8(CA9 1988) (observing with regard to Washington's 300-foot
zone that " `[t]here isn't one iota of testimony about a singlevoter that was upset, or intimidated, or threatened' " (quoting trial transcript)); National Broadcasting Co. v. Cleland,697 F. Supp. 1204, 1211-1212 (ND Ga. 1988);

CBS Inc. v.Smith, 681 F. Supp. 794, 803 (SD Fla. 1988). All of these

courts, having received evidence on this issue, were far bet-ter situated than we are to assess the contemporary necessity of campaign-free zones. All of these courts concludedthat such suppression of expression is unnecessary, suggesting that such zones were something of a social atavism. Tomy mind, this recent history, developed in the context of an
adversarial search for the truth, indicates that, whatever theoriginal historical basis for campaign-free zones may have
been, their continued "necessity" has not been established.Especially when we deal with the First Amendment, when
the reason for a restriction disappears, the restriction shouldas well.

II
In addition to sweeping too broadly in its reach, Tennes-see's campaign-free zone selectively prohibits speech based

on content. Like the statute the Court found invalid in
First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 785(1978), the Tennessee statute regulates "the subjects about

which persons may speak and the speakers who may addressa public issue." Within the zone, $ 2-7-111 silences all
campaign-related expression, but allows expression on anyother subject: religious, artistic, commercial speech, even political debate and solicitation concerning issues or candidatesnot on the day's ballot. Indeed, as I read it, $ 2-7-111 does
not prohibit exit polling, which surely presents at least as

Stevens, J., dissenting
great a potential interference with orderly access to the pollsas does the distribution of campaign leaflets, the display of

campaign posters, or the wearing of campaign buttons.This discriminatory feature of the statute severely undercuts
the credibility of its purported law-and-order justification.

Tennessee's content-based discrimination is particularlyproblematic because such a regulation will inevitably favor

certain groups of candidates. As the testimony in thiscase illustrates, several groups of candidates rely heavily
on last-minute campaigning. See App. 22-23. Candidateswith fewer resources, candidates for lower visibility offices,
and "grassroots" candidates benefit disproportionately from
last-minute campaigning near the polling place. See Note,
Defoliating the Grassroots: Election Day Restrictions on Political Speech, 77 Geo. L. J. 2137, 2158-2160 (1989) (collecting authorities).

Although the plurality recognizes that the Tennessee statute is content based, see ante, at 197-198, it does not inquire
into whether that discrimination itself is related to any purported state interest. To the contrary, the plurality makes
the surprising and unsupported claim that the selective regulation of protected speech is justified because, "[t]he First
Amendment does not require States to regulate for problems
that do not exist." Ante, at 207. Yet earlier this Term, the
Court rejected an asserted state interest because that interest "ha[d] nothing to do with the State's" content-based distinctions among expressive activities. Simon & Schuster,
Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S.
105, 120 (1991); see also Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v.
Ragland, 481 U. S. 221, 231 (1987). Similarly in Carey v.
Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 464-465 (1980), the Court acknowledged Illinois' interest in "residential privacy" but invalidated that State's ban on picketing because its distinction
between labor and nonlabor picketing could not be "justified
by reference to the State's interest in maintaining domestic
tranquility."

Stevens, J., dissenting
In this case the same is true: Tennessee's differentialtreatment of campaign speech furthers no asserted state interest. Access to, and order around, the polls would be justas threatened by the congregation of citizens concerned
about a local environmental issue not on the ballot as bythe congregation of citizens urging election of their favored
candidate. Similarly, assuming that disorder immediatelyoutside the polling place could lead to the commission of errors or the perpetration of fraud, such disorder could just aseasily be caused by a religious dispute sparked by a colporteur as by a campaign-related dispute sparked by a campaignworker. In short, Tennessee has failed to point to any legitimate interest that would justify its selective regulation ofcampaign-related expression.

III
Although the plurality purports to apply "exacting scru-tiny," its three marked departures from that familiar standard may have greater significance for the future than its pre-cise holding about campaign-free zones. First, the plurality
declines to take a hard look at whether a state law is in fact"necessary." Under the plurality's analysis, a State need
not demonstrate that contemporary demands compel its reg-ulation of protected expression; it need only show that that
regulation can be traced to a longstanding tradition.5Second, citing Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U. S.
189 (1986), the plurality lightens the State's burden of proofin showing that a restriction on speech is "narrowly tai5 The plurality emphasizes that this case "force[s] us to reconcile our
commitment to free speech with our commitment to other constitutional
rights." Ante, at 198 (citing Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333, 361-363
(1966)). Although I agree with the plurality on this matter, this characterization of the controversy does not compel (or even indicate) deference
to tradition. Indeed in Sheppard itself, the Court did not defer to tradition or established practices, but rather imposed on "appellate tribunals
. . . the duty to make an independent evaluation of the circumstances" of
every case. Id., at 362.

lored." In Munro, we upheld a Washington ballot-access
law and, in doing so, observed that we would not "requir[e]
a State to make a particularized showing of the existence
of voter confusion, ballot overcrowding, or the presence of
frivolous candidacies prior to the imposition of reasonable
restrictions on ballot access." Id., at 194-195. We stated
that legislatures "should be permitted to respond to potential
deficiencies in the electoral process with foresight rather
than reactively, provided that the response is reasonable and
does not significantly impinge on constitutionally protected
rights." Id., at 195-196. I have substantial doubts about
the plurality's extension of Munro's reasoning to this case,
most fundamentally because I question the plurality's assumption that campaign-free zones do "not significantly impinge on constitutionally protected rights." Not only is this
the very question before us, but in light of the sweep of such
zones and the vital First Amendment interests at stake, I do
not know how that assumption can be sound.

Third, although the plurality recognizes the problematic
character of Tennessee's content-based suppressive regulation, ante, at 197-198, it nonetheless upholds the statute because "there is simply no evidence" that commercial or charitable solicitation outside the polling place poses the same
potential dangers as campaigning outside the polling place,
ante, at 207. This analysis contradicts a core premise of
strict scrutiny--namely, that the heavy burden of justification is on the State. The plurality has effectively shifted
the burden of proving the necessity of content discrimination
from the State to the plaintiff.

In sum, what the plurality early in its opinion calls "exacting scrutiny," ante, at 198, appears by the end of its analysis
to be neither exacting nor scrutiny. To borrow a mixed metaphor, the plurality's scrutiny is "toothless." Mathews v.
Lucas, 427 U. S. 495, 510 (1976).

Ours is a Nation rich with traditions. Those traditionssometimes support, and sometimes are superseded by,

constitutional rules. By tradition, for example, Presidentialcampaigns end on election eve; yet Congress certainly could
not enforce that tradition by enacting a law proscribingcampaigning on election day. At one time as well, bans on
election-day editorial endorsements were traditional in someStates,

6 but Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S. 214 (1966), established that such bans are incompatible with the FirstAmendment.

In Mills, we set aside the conviction of a newspaper editorwho violated such a ban. In doing so, we declined to accept
the State's analogy between the electoral process and thejudicial process, and its claim that the State could, on election day, insulate voters from political sentiments and ideasmuch the same way as a jury is sequestered.

7 We squarely

rejected the State's claim that its ban was justified by theneed to protect the public " `from confusive last-minute

charges and countercharges and the distribution of propa-ganda in an effort to influence voters on an election day.' "
Id., at 219 (quoting State v. Mills, 278 Ala. 188, 195-196, 176So. 2d 884, 890 (1965)). To the contrary, we recognized that
it is precisely on election day that advocacy and campaigning"can be most effective."

Mills, 384 U. S., at 219. Millsstands for the simple proposition that, tradition notwithstanding, the State does not have a legitimate interest ininsulating voters from election-day campaigning. Thus, in

7 "The idea behind [the ban on endorsements] was to prevent the voters

from being subjected to unfair pressure and `brainwashing' on the day
when their minds should remain clear and untrammeled by such influences, just as this court is insulated against further partisan advocacy
once these arguments are submitted." Brief for Appellee, O. T. 1965,

light of Mills, the fact that campaign-free zones are "tradi-tional" tends to undermine, rather than to support, the validity of the Tennessee statute. In short, we should scrutinizethe Tennessee statute for what it is--a police power regulation that also silences a substantial amount of protected po-litical expression.

In my opinion, the presence of campaign workers outsidea polling place is, in most situations, a minor nuisance. But
we have long recognized that " `the fact that society may findspeech offensive is not a sufficient reason for suppressing
it.' " Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U. S. 46, 55(1988) (citation omitted). Although we often pay homage to
the electoral process, we must be careful not to confuse sanc-tity with silence. The hubbub of campaign workers outside
a polling place may be a nuisance, but it is also the sound ofa vibrant democracy.

In silencing that sound, Tennessee "trenches upon an areain which the importance of First Amendment protections is
`at its zenith.' " Meyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414, 425 (1988)(citation omitted). For that reason, Tennessee must shoulder the burden of demonstrating that its restrictions on po-litical speech are no broader than necessary to protect orderly access to the polls. It has not done so.I therefore respectfully dissent.

UNITED STATES v. BURKE et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 91-42. Argued January 21, 1992--Decided May 26, 1992
As part of the settlement of a sex discrimination claim under Title VII of

the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) paid
backpay to affected employees, including respondents, from which it
withheld federal income taxes. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
disallowed respondents' claims for refund of the withheld taxes. In a
subsequent refund action, the District Court ruled that, since respondents had obtained only backpay due them as a result of TVA's discriminatory underpayments rather than compensatory or other damages, the
settlement proceeds could not be excluded from their gross incomes as
"damages received . . . on account of personal injuries" under 26 U. S. C.

$ 104(a)(2). The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that TVA's discrimination constituted a personal, tort-like injury to respondents, and rejecting the Government's attempt to distinguish Title VII, which authorizes no compensatory or punitive damages, from other statutes
thought to redress personal injuries.

Held: Backpay awards in settlement of Title VII claims are not excludable

from gross income under $ 104(a)(2). Pp. 233-242.

(a) IRS regulations formally link identification of a "personal injury"
for purposes of $ 104(a)(2) to traditional tort principles, referring to
"prosecution of a legal suit or action based upon tort or tort type
rights." 26 CFR $ 1.104-1(c). In order to fall within the $ 104(a)(2)
exclusion, respondents must show that Title VII, the legal basis for their
recovery of backpay, redresses a tort-like personal injury. Pp. 233-234.

(b) A hallmark of traditional tort liability is the availability of a broad
range of damages to compensate the plaintiff for harm sustained. Title
VII, however, permits the award of only backpay and other injunctive
relief. Congress sought through Title VII to restore victims to the
wage and employment positions they would have occupied absent discrimination, but declined, in contrast to other federal antidiscrimination
statutes, to recompense victims for any of the other traditional harms
associated with personal injury, such as pain and suffering, emotional
distress, harm to reputation, or other consequential damages. Thus,
Title VII cannot be said to redress a tort-like personal injury within the
meaning of $ 104(a)(2) and the applicable regulations. Pp. 234-242.

on the basis of sex. The Office and Professional EmployeesInternational Union, which represented the affected employees, intervened. Among the represented employees wererespondents Therese A. Burke, Cynthia R. Center, and
Linda G. Gibbs.The complaint alleged that TVA had increased the salaries
of employees in certain male-dominated pay schedules, buthad not increased the salaries of employees in certain
female-dominated schedules. In addition, the complaintalleged that TVA had lowered salaries in some femaledominated schedules. App. in No. 90-5607 (CA6) (herein-after App.), pp. 28-32 (Second Amended Complaint). The
plaintiffs sought injunctive relief as well as backpay for allaffected female employees. Id., at 33-34. The defendants
filed a counterclaim against the union alleging, among otherthings, fraud, misrepresentation, and breach of contract.
Id., at 35.After the District Court denied cross-motions for summary judgment, the parties reached a settlement. TVAagreed to pay $4,200 to Hutcheson and a total of $5 million
for the other affected employees, to be distributed under aformula based on length of service and rates of pay.

Id., at70-71, 76-77. Although TVA did not withhold taxes on the

$4,200 for Hutcheson, it did withhold, pursuant to the agree-ment, federal income taxes on the amounts allocated to the
other affected employees, including the three respondentshere.

Opinion of the Court
Respondents filed claims for refund of the taxes withheldfrom the settlement payments. The Internal Revenue

Service (IRS) disallowed those claims. Respondents thenbrought a refund action in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of Tennessee, claiming that the set-tlement payments should be excluded from their respective
gross incomes under $ 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Codeas "damages received (whether by suit or agreement and
whether as lump sums or as periodic payments) on accountof personal injuries or sickness." The District Court ruled
that, because respondents sought and obtained only backwages due them as a result of TVA's discriminatory underpayments rather than compensatory or other damages, thesettlement proceeds could not be excluded from gross income
as "damages received . . . on account of personal injuries."90-1 USTC || 50,203 (1990).

The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit,by a divided vote, reversed. 929 F. 2d 1119 (1991). The
Court of Appeals concluded that exclusion under $ 104(a)(2)turns on whether the injury and the claim are "personal and
tort-like in nature." Id., at 1121. "If the answer is in theaffirmative," the court held, "then that is the beginning and
end of the inquiry." Id., at 1123 (internal quotation marksomitted). The court concluded that TVA's unlawful sex
discrimination constituted a personal, tort-like injury torespondents, and rejected the Government's attempt to
distinguish Title VII, which authorizes no compensatory orpunitive damages,

Opinion of the Court
The dissent in the Court of Appeals, 929 F. 2d, at 1124,took the view that the settlement of respondents' claims for

earned but unpaid wage differentials--wages that wouldhave been paid and would have been subjected to tax absent
TVA's unlawful discrimination--did not constitute compensa-tion for "loss due to a tort," as required under $ 104(a)(2).

A
The definition of gross income under the Internal RevenueCode sweeps broadly. Section 61(a), 26 U. S. C. $ 61(a), provides that "gross income means all income from whateversource derived," subject only to the exclusions specifically
enumerated elsewhere in the Code. As this Court has rec-ognized, Congress intended through $ 61(a) and its statutory
precursors to exert "the full measure of its taxing power,"
Helvering v. Clifford, 309 U. S. 331, 334 (1940), and to bringwithin the definition of income any "accessio[n] to wealth."

Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., 348 U. S. 426, 431(1955). There is no dispute that the settlement awards in
this case would constitute gross income within the reach of$ 61(a). See Brief for Respondents 9-10.

The question, however, is whether the awards qualify forspecial exclusion from gross income under $ 104(a), which

4

Neither the text nor the legislative history of $ 104(a)(2)offers any explanation of the term "personal injuries."

5

Since 1960, however, IRS regulations formally have linkedidentification of a personal injury for purposes of $ 104(a)(2)

to traditional tort principles: "The term `damages received(whether by suit or agreement)' means an amount received
. . . through prosecution of a legal suit or action based upontort or tort type rights, or through a settlement agreement
entered into in lieu of such prosecution." 26 CFR $ 1.104-1(c) (1991). See

Threlkeld v. Commissioner, 87 T. C. 1294,1305 (1986) ("The essential element of an exclusion under

section 104(a)(2) is that the income involved must derivefrom some sort of tort claim against the payor. . . . As a
result, common law tort law concepts are helpful in decidingwhether a taxpayer is being compensated for a `personal injury' ") (internal quotation marks omitted), aff 'd, 848 F. 2d81 (CA6 1988).

A "tort" has been defined broadly as a "civil wrong, otherthan breach of contract, for which the court will provide a
remedy in the form of an action for damages." See W. Kee-ton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on
the Law of Torts 2 (1984). Remedial principles thus figureprominently in the definition and conceptualization of torts.

4 Section 104, entitled "Compensation for injuries or sickness," provides
similar exclusions from gross income for amounts received for personal
injuries or sickness under worker's compensation programs ($ 104(a)(1)),
accident or health insurance ($ 104(a)(3)), and certain federal pension programs ($ 104(a)(4)).

Opinion of the Court
See R. Heuston, Salmond on the Law of Torts 9 (12th ed.1957) (noting that "an action for damages" is "an essential

characteristic of every true tort," and that, even where otherrelief, such as an injunction, may be available, "in all such
cases it is solely by virtue of the right to damages that thewrong complained of is to be classed as a tort"). Indeed,
one of the hallmarks of traditional tort liability is the avail-ability of a broad range of damages to compensate the plaintiff "fairly for injuries caused by the violation of his legalrights."

Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 257 (1978). Al-though these damages often are described in compensatory

terms, see Memphis Community School Dist. v. Stachura,477 U. S. 299, 306 (1986), in many cases they are larger than
the amount necessary to reimburse actual monetary loss sus-tained or even anticipated by the plaintiff, and thus redress
intangible elements of injury that are "deemed important,even though not pecuniary in [their] immediate consequence[s]." D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies 136 (1973). Cf.
Molzof v. United States, 502 U. S. 301, 306-307 (1992) (com-pensatory awards that exceed actual loss are not prohibited

as "punitive" damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act).For example, the victim of a physical injury may be permitted, under the relevant state law, to recover damages notonly for lost wages, medical expenses, and diminished future
earning capacity on account of the injury, but also for emo-tional distress and pain and suffering. See Dobbs, at 540-
551; Threlkeld v. Commissioner, 87 T. C., at 1300. Similarly,the victim of a "dignitary" or nonphysical tort

Krause, & A. Gans, American Law of Torts 6 (1983), nonphysical injuries
to the individual, such as those affecting emotions, reputation, or character, as well. See, e. g., Rickel v. Commissioner, 900 F. 2d 655, 658 (CA3
1990) (noting that "it is judicially well-established that the meaning of
`personal injuries' in this context encompasses both nonphysical as well as
physical injuries"); Roemer v. Commissioner, 716 F. 2d 693, 697 (CA9 1983)
(noting that $ 104(a)(2) "says nothing about physical injuries," and that
"[t]he ordinary meaning of a personal injury is not limited to a physical
one"); Rev. Rule 85-98, 1985-2 Cum. Bull. 51 (holding that the $ 104(a)(2)
exclusion "makes no distinction between physical or emotional injuries");
1972-2 Cum. Bull. 3, acquiescing in Seay v. Commissioner, 58 T. C. 32,
40 (1972) (holding that damages received for "personal embarrassment,"
"mental strain," and injury to "personal reputation" may be excluded
under $ 104(a)(2), and noting prior rulings regarding alienation of affections and defamation). See also B. Bittker & L. Lokken, Federal Taxation of Income, Estates and Gifts 13-11 (2d ed. 1989); Burke & Friel, Tax
Treatment of Employment-Related Personal Injury Awards, 50 Mont. L.
Rev. 13, 21 (1989).

Congress' 1989 amendment to $ 104(a)(2) provides further support for
the notion that "personal injuries" includes physical as well as nonphysical
injuries. Congress rejected a bill that would have limited the $ 104(a)(2)
exclusion to cases involving "physical injury or physical sickness." See
H. R. Rep. No. 101-247, pp. 1354-1355 (1989) (describing proposed $ 11641
of H. R. 3299, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. (1989)). At the same time, Congress
amended $ 104(a) to allow the exclusion of punitive damages only in
cases involving "physical injury or physical sickness." Pub. L. 101-239,

$ 7641(a), 103 Stat. 2379, 26 U. S. C. $ 104(a) (1988 ed., Supp. I). The enactment of this limited amendment addressing only punitive damages shows
that Congress assumed that other damages (i. e., compensatory) would be
excluded in cases of both physical and nonphysical injury.

Notwithstanding Justice Scalia's contention in his separate opinion
that the term "personal injuries" must be read as limited to "health"-
related injuries, see post, at 244, the foregoing authorities establish that

$ 104(a)(2) in fact encompasses a broad range of physical and nonphysical
injuries to personal interests. Justice Scalia implicitly acknowledges
that the plain meaning of the statutory phrase can support this wellestablished view. See post, at 243-244.

510-520. Furthermore, punitive or exemplary damages aregenerally available in those instances where the defendant's
misconduct was intentional or reckless. See id., at 204-208;
Molzof v. United States, supra.We thus agree with the Court of Appeals' analysis insofar

as it focused, for purposes of $ 104(a)(2), on the nature of theclaim underlying respondents' damages award. See 929 F.
2d, at 1121; Threlkeld v. Commissioner, 87 T. C., at 1305.Respondents, for their part, agree that this is the appropriate inquiry, as does the dissent. See Brief for Respond-ents 9-12;

post, at 250.7 In order to come within the$ 104(a)(2) income exclusion, respondents therefore must

show that Title VII, the legal basis for their recovery ofbackpay, redresses a tort-like personal injury in accord with
the foregoing principles. We turn next to this inquiry.

B
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 8 makes it an un-lawful employment practice for an employer "to discriminate

against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of

7 The dissent nonetheless contends that we "misapprehen[d] the nature
of the inquiry required by $ 104(a)(2) and the IRS regulation" by "[f]ocusing on [the] remedies" available under Title VII. See post, at 249-250.
As discussed above, however, the concept of a "tort" is inextricably bound
up with remedies--specifically damages actions. Thus, we believe that
consideration of the remedies available under Title VII is critical in determining the "nature of the statute" and the "type of claim" brought by
respondents for purposes of $ 104(a)(2). See post, at 250.

8 As discussed below, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. 102-166, 105

Stat. 1071, amended Title VII in significant respects. Respondents do not
contend that these amendments apply to this case. See Tr. of Oral Arg.
35-36. We therefore examine the law as it existed prior to November 21,
1991, the effective date of the 1991 Act. See Pub. L. 102-166, $ 402(a), 105
Stat. 1099. Unless otherwise indicated, all references are to the "unamended" Title VII.

such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1). If administrative remedies are

unsuccessful, an aggrieved employee may file suit in a dis-trict court, $ 2000e-5(f )(1), although the Courts of Appeals
have held that Title VII plaintiffs, unlike ordinary tort plaintiffs, are not entitled to a jury trial. See, e. g., Johnson v.
Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 417 F. 2d 1122, 1125 (CA5
1969). See also Curtis v. Loether, 415 U. S. 189, 192-193(1974) (describing availability of jury trials for common-law

forms of action); id., at 196-197, n. 13 (citing Title VII cases).If the court finds that the employer has engaged in an unlawful employment practice, it may enjoin the practice and
"order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, which
may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring of
employees, with or without back pay . . . or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate." $ 2000e-5(g).

It is beyond question that discrimination in employment
on the basis of sex, race, or any of the other classifications
protected by Title VII is, as respondents argue and this
Court consistently has held, an invidious practice that causes
grave harm to its victims. See Brief for Respondents
35-39; Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424 (1971). The
fact that employment discrimination causes harm to individuals does not automatically imply, however, that there exists
a tort-like "personal injury" for purposes of federal income
tax law.

Indeed, in contrast to the tort remedies for physical and
nonphysical injuries discussed above, Title VII does not
allow awards for compensatory or punitive damages; instead,
it limits available remedies to backpay, injunctions, and other
equitable relief. See $ 2000e-5(g); Patterson v. McLean
Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 182, n. 4 (1989) (noting that

a plaintiff in a Title VII action is "limited to a recovery
of backpay"); Great American Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v.

Opinion of the Court
438 (1991) (collecting cases). An employee wrongfully dis-charged on the basis of sex thus may recover only an amount

equal to the wages the employee would have earned fromthe date of discharge to the date of reinstatement, along with
lost fringe benefits such as vacation pay and pension bene-fits;

9 similarly, an employee wrongfully denied a promotion

on the basis of sex, or, as in this case, wrongfully discrimi-nated against in salary on the basis of sex, may recover only

the differential between the appropriate pay and actual payfor services performed, as well as lost benefits.

The Court previously has observed that Title VII focuseson "legal injuries of an economic character," see

AlbemarlePaper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 418 (1975), consisting specifically of the unlawful deprivation of full wages earned ordue for services performed, or the unlawful deprivation of
the opportunity to earn wages through wrongful termina-tion. The remedy, correspondingly, consists of restoring
victims, through backpay awards and injunctive relief, to thewage and employment positions they would have occupied
absent the unlawful discrimination. See id., at 421 (citing118 Cong. Rec. 7168 (1972)). Nothing in this remedial
scheme purports to recompense a Title VII plaintiff for anyof the other traditional harms associated with personal injury, such as pain and suffering, emotional distress, harm toreputation, or other consequential damages (e. g., a ruined
credit rating). See Walker v. Ford Motor Co., 684 F. 2d1355, 1364-1365, n. 16 (CA11 1982).

No doubt discrimination could constitute a "personal in-jury" for purposes of $ 104(a)(2) if the relevant cause of action
evidenced a tort-like conception of injury and remedy. Cf.
Curtis v. Loether, 415 U. S., at 195-196, n. 10 (noting that"under the logic of the common law development of a law of

9 Some courts have allowed Title VII plaintiffs who were wrongfully
discharged and for whom reinstatement was not feasible to recover "front
pay" or future lost earnings. See, e. g., Shore v. Federal Express Corp.,

insult and indignity, racial discrimination might be treated
as a dignitary tort" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, the circumscribed remedies available under Title VII
stand in marked contrast not only to those available under
traditional tort law, but under other federal antidiscrimination statutes, as well.10 For example, Rev. Stat. $ 1977, 42
U. S. C. $ 1981, permits victims of race-based employment
discrimination to obtain a jury trial at which "both equitable
and legal relief, including compensatory and, under certain
circumstances, punitive damages" may be awarded. Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421 U. S. 454, 460
(1975). The Court similarly has observed that Title VIII of
the Civil Rights Act of 1968, whose fair housing provisions
allow for jury trials and for awards of compensatory and punitive damages, "sounds basically in tort" and "contrasts
sharply" with the relief available under Title VII. Curtis v.
Loether, 415 U. S., at 195, 197; 42 U. S. C. $ 3613(c).11

10 Title VII's remedial scheme was expressly modeled on the backpay
provision of the National Labor Relations Act. See Albemarle Paper Co.
v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 419-420, and n. 11 (1975); 29 U. S. C. $ 160(c)
(Board shall order persons to "cease and desist" from unfair labor practices
and to take "affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with
or without back pay"). This Court previously has held that backpay
awarded under the Labor Act to an unlawfully discharged employee constitutes "wages" for purposes of the Social Security Act. See Social Security Board v. Nierotko, 327 U. S. 358 (1946).

11 Respondents' attempts to prove that Title VII redresses a personal

injury by relying on this Court's characterizations of other antidiscrimination statutes are thus unpersuasive in light of those statutes' differing
remedial schemes. For example, respondents' reliance on Goodman v.
Lukens Steel Co., 482 U. S. 656 (1987), is misplaced, as that case involved
the interpretation of $ 1981. See Brief for Respondents 35-37. Respondents' attempt to apply the Court's statement in Curtis v. Loether, 415
U. S., at 195, that Title VIII "sounds basically in tort" to the Title VII
context similarly fails. See Brief for Respondents 32. Indeed, Curtis
itself distinguishes Title VII from Title VIII on a host of different
grounds. See 415 U. S., at 196-197. The dissent commits the same error
as respondents in attempting to analogize suits arising under Title VII to

Opinion of the Court
Notwithstanding a common-law tradition of broad tort
damages and the existence of other federal antidiscrimination statutes offering similarly broad remedies, Congress declined to recompense Title VII plaintiffs for anything beyond
the wages properly due them--wages that, if paid in the ordinary course, would have been fully taxable. See L. Frolik,
Federal Tax Aspects of Injury, Damage, and Loss 70 (1987).
Thus, we cannot say that a statute such as Title VII,12 whose
sole remedial focus is the award of back wages, redresses a
tort-like personal injury within the meaning of $ 104(a)(2)
and the applicable regulations.13

those involving other federal antidiscrimination statutes for purposes of

$ 104(a)(2). See post, at 250-252.

12 Respondents contend that Congress' recent expansion of Title VII's

remedial scope supports their argument that Title VII claims are inherently tort-like in nature. See Brief for Respondents 34. Under the Civil
Rights Act of 1991, victims of intentional discrimination are entitled to a
jury trial, at which they may recover compensatory damages for "future
pecuniary losses, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish,
loss of enjoyment of life, and other nonpecuniary losses," as well as punitive damages. See Pub. L. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1073. Unlike respondents,
however, we believe that Congress' decision to permit jury trials and compensatory and punitive damages under the amended Act signals a marked
change in its conception of the injury redressable by Title VII, and cannot
be imported back into analysis of the statute as it existed at the time of
this lawsuit. See, e. g., H. R. Rep. No. 102-40, pt. 1, pp. 64-65 (1991) (Report of Committee on Education and Labor) ("Monetary damages also are
necessary to make discrimination victims whole for the terrible injury to
their careers, to their mental and emotional health, and to their selfrespect and dignity"); id., pt. 2, p. 25 (Report of Committee on the Judiciary) ("The limitation of relief under Title VII to equitable remedies often
means that victims of intentional discrimination may not recover for the
very real effects of the discrimination").

13 Our holding that damages received in settlement of a Title VII claim

are not properly excludable under $ 104(a)(2) finds support in longstanding
rulings of the IRS. See, e. g., Rev. Rule 72-341, 1972-2 Cum. Bull. 32
(payments by corporation to its employees in settlement of Title VII suit
must be included in the employees' gross income, as the payments "were
based on compensation that they otherwise would have received").

242 UNITED STATES v. BURKE

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
Accordingly, we hold that the backpay awards received byrespondents in settlement of their Title VII claims are not

excludable from gross income as "damages received . . . onaccount of personal injuries" under $ 104(a)(2). The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment.
Section 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code excludesfrom gross income "the amount of any damages received . . .

on account of personal injuries or sickness." 26 U. S. C.$ 104(a)(2) (emphasis added). The Court accepts at the outset of its analysis the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regu-lation (dating from 1960) that identifies "personal injuries"
under this exclusion with the violation of, generically, "tortor tort type rights," 25 Fed. Reg. 11490 (1960); 26 CFR

$ 1.104-1(c) (1991) 1--thus extending the coverage of theprovision to " `dignitary' or nonphysical tort[s] such as defamation," ante, at 235-236 (footnote omitted). Thereafter,the opinion simply considers the criterion for determining
whether "tort or tort type rights" are at stake, the issue onwhich it disagrees with the dissent.

In my view there is no basis for accepting, without qualifi-cation, the IRS' "tort rights" formulation, since it is not
within the range of reasonable interpretation of the statu-tory text. See

Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources
Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-845 (1984). In isolation, I suppose, the term "personal injuries" can be read toencompass injury to any noncontractual interest " `for which

the court will provide a remedy in the form of an action for

1 Though this regulation purports expressly to define only the term
"damages received," 26 CFR $ 1.104-1(c) (1991), and not the succeeding
term we are called upon to interpret today ("personal injuries"), the IRS
has long treated the regulation as descriptive of the ambit of $ 104(a)(2) as
a whole. See, e. g., Rev. Rul. 85-98, 1985-2 Cum. Bull. 51; Brief for United
States 22-23.

damages.' " Ante, at 234 (quoting W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R.Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts

2 (1984)). That is assuredly not, however, the only permissi-ble meaning of the term. Indeed, its more common connotation embraces only physical injuries to the person (as whenthe consequences of an auto accident are divided into "personal injuries" and "property damage"),2 or perhaps, in addi-tion, injuries to a person's mental health.

"Under the American decisional law, the phrase `per-sonal injury' denotes primarily an injury to the body of
a person. At least some of the courts, however, havenot narrowly limited the term, and have concluded that
a personal injury or an injury to the person, within themeaning of the law, does not necessarily involve physical
contact with the person injured or mere bodily or physi-cal injuries, but may embrace all actionable injuries
to the individual himself." 1 S. Speiser, C. Krause, &A. Gans, American Law of Torts 6 (1983).

See also Black's Law Dictionary 786 (6th ed. 1990).In deciding whether the words go beyond their more narrow and more normal meaning here, the critical factor, in myview, is the fact that "personal injuries" appears not in isolation but as part of the phrase "personal injuries or sickness."As the Court has said repeatedly, "[t]he maxim noscitur a
sociis, that a word is known by the company it keeps, whilenot an inescapable rule, is often wisely applied where a word
is capable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving ofunintended breadth to the Acts of Congress." Jarecki v.
G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307 (1961). The term "sick-ness" connotes a "[d]iseased condition; illness; [or] ill health,"
Webster's New International Dictionary 2329-2330 (2d ed.1950), and I think that its companion must similarly be read

2 As it happens, this was the IRS' original understanding with regard
to $ 104(a)(2)'s predecessor, $ 213(b)(6) of the Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat.
1066. See, e. g., S. 1384, 2 Cum. Bull. 71 (1920).

to connote injuries to physical (or mental) health. It is al-most as odd to believe that the first part of the phrase "personal injuries or sickness" encompasses defamation, as itwould be to believe that the first part of the phrase "five
feet, two inches" refers to pedal extremities.The commonsense interpretation I suggest is supported
as well by several other factors. First, the term "personalinjuries or sickness" is used three other times in $ 104(a), and
in each instance its sense is necessarily limited to injuries tophysical or mental health. See $ 104(a)(1) (gross income
does not include "amounts received under workmen's compensation acts as compensation for personal injuries or
sickness" (emphasis added)); $ 104(a)(3) (gross income does notinclude "amounts received through accident or health insurance for personal injuries or sickness" (emphasis added));$ 104(a)(4) (gross income does not include "amounts received
as a pension, annuity, or similar allowance for personal injuries or sickness resulting from active service in the armed
forces . . . or as a disability annuity payable under . . . theForeign Service Act" (emphasis added)). When, sandwiched

in among these provisions, one sees an exclusion for "the
amount of any damages received . . . on account of personalinjuries or sickness," one has little doubt what is intended,

and it is not recovery for defamation (or other invasions of"personal" interests that do not, of necessity, harm the victim's physical or mental health). Second, the provision atissue here is a tax

exemption, a category of text for which
we have adopted a rule of narrow construction. See, e. g.,
United States v. Centennial Savings Bank FSB, 499 U. S.
573, 583-584 (1991).3

3 Congress amended $ 104(a), in 1989, to provide prospectively that

$ 104(a)(2) shall not shelter from taxation "punitive damages in connection
with a case not involving physical injury or physical sickness." Pub. L.
101-239, $ 7641(a), 103 Stat. 2379, 26 U. S. C. $ 104(a) (1988 ed., Supp. I);
see id., $ 7641(b). As thus amended it is clear (whereas previously it was
not) that "personal injuries or sickness" includes not only physical, but

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
The question, then, is whether the settlement payments atissue in this case were "received . . . on account of personal

injuries"--viz., "on account of " injuries to the recipients'physical or mental health--so as to qualify for exclusion
under $ 104(a)(2). I think not. Though it is quite possiblefor a victim of race- or sex-based employment discrimination to suffer psychological harm, her entitlement to back-pay under Title VII does not depend on such a showing.
Whether or not she has experienced the sort of disturbancesto her mental health that the phrase "personal injuries" describes, a Title VII claimant is entitled to be "restor[ed] . . .to the wage and employment positio[n] [she] would have occupied absent the unlawful discrimination." Ante, at 239;see Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 420-421
(1975) ("[G]iven a finding of unlawful discrimination, backpayshould be denied only for reasons which, if applied generally,
would not frustrate the central statutory purposes of eradi-cating discrimination throughout the economy . . ."). The
only harm that Title VII dignifies with the status of redress-able

legal injury is the antecedent economic deprivation thatproduced the Title VII violation in the first place. See id.,

at 418 ("Title VII deals with legal injuries of an economiccharacter . . ."). I thus conclude that respondents did not
receive their settlement payments (in respect of backpay)"on account of personal injuries" within the meaning of

$ 104(a)(2), and would reverse the judgment of the Court ofAppeals.

It is true that the Secretary's current regulation, at leastas it has been applied by the IRS, see n. 1,

supra, contradictsthe interpretation of the statute I have set forth above. But

while agencies are bound by those regulations that are is-sued within the scope of their lawful discretion (at least until
the regulations are modified or rescinded through approalso psychological harm or disease; nevertheless, the amendment does not
require the phrase unnaturally to be extended to injuries that affect neither mind nor body.

priate means, see, e. g., Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United
States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463
U. S. 29, 41-42 (1983)), they cannot be bound by regulationsthat are contrary to law. Otherwise, the Secretary of the

Treasury would effectively be empowered to repeal taxes
that the Congress enacts. Cf. Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U. S. 414, 427-428 (1990). The existence of an ever-so-rare "taxpayer-friendly" Treasury regula-tion (however inconsistent with the statutory text) may be

relevant to whether penalties for blameworthy failure to paycan be assessed, see

Cheek v. United States, 498 U. S. 192
(1991), but it cannot control the determination whether thetax was due and owing according to Congress' command.

Finally (and relatedly), I must acknowledge that the basis
for reversing the Court of Appeals on which I rely has not
been argued by the United States, here or below. The rule
that points not argued will not be considered is more than
just a prudential rule of convenience; its observance, at least
in the vast majority of cases, distinguishes our adversary
system of justice from the inquisitorial one. See United
States v. Pryce, 291 U. S. App. D. C. 84, 96, 938 F. 2d 1343,
1355 (1991) (Silberman, J., dissenting in part). Even so,
there must be enough play in the joints that the Supreme
Court need not render judgment on the basis of a rule of law
whose nonexistence is apparent on the face of things, simply
because the parties agree upon it--particularly when the
judgment will reinforce error already prevalent in the system. See, e. g., Arcadia v. Ohio Power Co., 498 U. S. 73
(1990). I think that is the case here.

For the foregoing reasons, I concur in the judgment.

Justice Souter, concurring in the judgment.

income unless their action was one "based upon tort or tort

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
omy between contract and tort posited by the dissent, post,at 249-252, there are good reasons to put a Title VII claim

on the tort side of the line. There are definite parallels be-tween, say, a defamation action, which vindicates the plaintiff 's interest in good name, and a Title VII suit, which argu-ably vindicates an interest in dignity as a human being
entitled to be judged on individual merit. Our cases have,indeed, recognized parallels (though for different purposes)
between tort claims and claims under antidiscriminationstatutes other than Title VII. See

Goodman v. Lukens
Steel Co., 482 U. S. 656, 661 (1987) (similarity between claim
under 42 U. S. C. $ 1981 and personal-injury claim for
purposes of determining applicable statute of limitations);
Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U. S. 261, 277-278 (1985) (same for
42 U. S. C. $ 1983).The reasons do not go solely to that one side, however.

While I do not join the majority in holding that the tort-likecharacter of a claim should turn solely on whether the plaintiff can recover for "intangible elements of injury," ante, at235, I agree that Title VII's limitation of recovery to lost
wages ("back pay") counts against holding respondents' statutory action to be "tort type." Tort actions, it cannot begainsaid, commonly (though not invariably*) permit recovery for intangible injury. Ante, at 234-237. Backpay, onthe other hand, is quintessentially a contractual measure of
damages.A further similarity between Title VII and contract law,
at least in the context of an existing employment relation-ship, is the great resemblance of rights guaranteed by Title
VII to those commonly arising under the terms and condi*In those States that have barred recovery in tort for "intangible elements of injury," see, e. g., N. J. Stat. Ann. $ 59:9-2(d) (West 1982) (action
against public entity or employee); Wash. Rev. Code $ 4.20.046(1) (1989)
(action by estate of deceased), the modified action is still fairly described
as one "based upon tort rights," and certainly is an "action based upon
tort-type rights."

tions of an employment contract: Title VII's ban on discrimi-nation is easily envisioned as a contractual term implied by

law. See Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U. S. 69, 74-75,n. 6 (1984) ("Even if the employment contract did not afford
a basis for an implied condition that the [decision to promote]
would be fairly made on the merits, Title VII itself wouldimpose such a requirement");

Patterson v. McLean Credit
Union, 491 U. S. 164, 177 (1989) ("[T]he performance of es-tablished contract obligations and the conditions of continuing employment [are] matters . . . governed by state contractlaw and Title VII"). Indeed, it has been suggested that "the
rights guaranteed by Title VII are implied terms of everyemployment contract . . . ." Shanor & Marcosson, Battleground for a Divided Court: Employment Discrimination in
the Supreme Court, 1988-89, 6 Lab. Law. 145, 174, n. 118
(1990) (emphasis added).

In sum, good reasons tug each way. It is needless to decide which tug harder, however, for the outcome in this case
follows from the default rule of statutory interpretation that
exclusions from income must be narrowly construed. See
United States v. Centennial Savings Bank FSB, 499 U. S.
573, 583-584 (1991); Commissioner v. Jacobson, 336 U. S. 28,
49 (1949). That is, an accession to wealth is not to be held
excluded from income unless some provision of the Internal
Revenue Code clearly so entails. There being here no clear
application of 26 U. S. C. $ 104(a)(2) as interpreted by the
Treasury regulation, I concur in the judgment.

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Thomas joins,
dissenting.

The Court holds that respondents, unlike most plaintiffs
who secure compensation after suffering personal injury,
must pay tax on their recoveries for alleged discrimination
because suits under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 Stat. $ 2000e et seq., do not involve "tort type rights." This is so, the Court says, because

"Congress declined to recompense Title VII plaintiffs foranything beyond the wages properly due them." Ante, at

241. I cannot agree. In my view, the remedies available toTitle VII plaintiffs do not fix the character of the right they
seek to enforce. The purposes and operation of Title VIIare closely analogous to those of tort law, and that similarity
should determine excludability of recoveries for personal in-jury under 26 U. S. C. $ 104(a)(2).

I
Section 104(a)(2) allows taxpayers to exclude from grossincome "damages received . . . on account of personal injuries

or sickness." The Court properly defers to an Internal Rev-enue Service (IRS) regulation that reasonably interprets the
words "damages received" to mean "an amount received . . .through prosecution of a legal suit or action based upon tort
or tort type rights, or through a settlement agreement en-tered into in lieu of such prosecution." 26 CFR $ 1.104-1(c)
(1991). See ante, at 234; United States v. Correll, 389 U. S.299 (1967). Therefore, respondents may exclude from gross
income any amount they received as a result of asserting a"tort type" right to recover for personal injury.

The Court appears to accept that discrimination in theworkplace causes personal injury cognizable for purposes of

$ 104(a)(2), see ante, at 239, and there can be little doubtabout this point. See

Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., 482U. S. 656, 661 (1987) ("[R]acial discrimination . . . is a fundamental injury to the individual rights of a person"); PriceWaterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228, 265 (1989) (

O'Connor,J., concurring in judgment) ("[W]hatever the final outcome

of a decisional process, the inclusion of race or sex as a con-sideration within it harms both society and the individual").
I disagree only with the Court's further holding that re-spondents' action did not assert tort-like rights because Congress limited the remedies available to Title VII plaintiffs.Focusing on remedies, it seems to me, misapprehends the

O'Connor, J., dissenting
nature of the inquiry required by $ 104(a)(2) and the IRS reg-ulation. The question whether Title VII suits are based on

the same sort of rights as a tort claim must be answeredwith reference to the nature of the statute and the type of
claim brought under it.

Title VII makes employment discrimination actionablewithout regard to contractual arrangements between employer and employee. Functionally, the law operates in thetraditional manner of torts: Courts award compensation for
invasions of a right to be free from certain injury in theworkplace. Like damages in tort suits, moreover, monetary
relief for violations of Title VII serves a public purpose beyond offsetting specific losses. "It is the reasonably certain
prospect of a backpay award that `provide[s] the spur or catalyst which causes employers and unions to self-examine and
to self-evaluate their employment practices and to endeavor
to eliminate, so far as possible, the last vestiges of [discrimination].' " Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405,
417-418 (1975) (quoting United States v. N. L. Industries,
Inc., 479 F. 2d 354, 379 (CA8 1973)).

Such a scheme fundamentally differs from contract liability, which "is imposed by the law for the protection of
a single, limited interest, that of having the promises of others performed." W. Prosser, Law of Torts 5 (4th ed. 1971).
Title VII liability also is distinguishable from quasicontractual liability, which "is created for the prevention of
unjust enrichment of one man at the expense of another, and
the restitution of benefits which in good conscience belong to
the plaintiff." Ibid. It is irrelevant for purposes of Title
VII that an employer profits from discriminatory practices;
the purpose of liability is not to reassign economic benefits to their rightful owner, but to compensate employees for
injury they suffer and to "eradicat[e] discrimination throughout the economy." Albemarle Paper, supra, at 421.

This Court has found statutory causes of action for discrimination analogous to tort suits on prior occasions, but

251Cite as: 504 U. S. 229 (1992)

has not suggested that this comparison turns on the specificmonetary relief available. In

Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U. S.
261 (1985), we considered which state statute of limitationsis most appropriately applied to a claim brought under 42

U. S. C. $ 1983. The Court answered this question by looking not to the remedies afforded a $ 1983 plaintiff, but to "theessence of the claim" and "the elements of the cause of

action." Id., at 268. Of greatest significance was the factthat Congress designed the Civil Rights Act of 1871 to provide a civil remedy for violations of constitutional rights inthe postwar South. Because Congress was concerned with
harms that "plainly sounded in tort," it only remained forthe Court to select the best comparison from among "a broad
range of potential tort analogies, from injuries to property
to infringements of individual liberty." Id., at 277. In con-cluding that the closest state-law equivalent to a $ 1983 suit

is a tort claim for personal injury, the Court once more em-phasized the rights made enforceable under federal law:

"The unifying theme of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 isreflected in the language of the Fourteenth Amendment that unequivocally recognizes the equal status ofevery `

person' subject to the jurisdiction of any of the
several States. The Constitution's command is thatall `

persons' shall be accorded the full privileges of
citizenship . . . . A violation of that command is aninjury to the individual rights of the person."

Ibid.
(footnote omitted).

When asked in Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., supra, to
determine the appropriate state analogue to a suit under 42
U. S. C. $ 1981, the Court again considered the rights protected by federal law rather than the recovery that could
be had by a plaintiff. As in Wilson, the tort-like nature of
a $ 1981 claim was clear. See 482 U. S., at 661. Accordingly,
the Court quickly turned to rejecting the view that $ 1981
suits are more similar to tort actions for interference with

504US1$75J 02-20-99 18:01:58 PAGES OPINPGT
252 UNITED STATES v. BURKE

O'Connor, J., dissenting
contractual rights than to claims based on personal injury.The Court noted that while $ 1981 deals partially with contracts, it is "part of a federal law barring racial discrimina-tion, which . . . is a fundamental injury to the individual
rights of a person." Ibid. Moreover, the economic conse-quences of $ 1981 "flo[w] from guaranteeing the personal
right to engage in economically significant activity free fromracially discriminatory interference."

Id., at 661-662. Themost analogous state statute of limitations in a $ 1981 action

is, therefore, the one governing personal injury suits. Id.,at 662.

Wilson and Goodman held federal civil rights suits analo-gous to personal injury tort actions not at all because of the
damages available to civil rights plaintiffs, but because fed-eral law protected individuals against tort-like personal injuries. Discrimination in the workplace being no less injuri-ous than discrimination elsewhere, the rights asserted by
persons who sue under Title VII are just as tort-like as therights asserted by plaintiffs in actions brought under $$ 1981
and 1983. II

The Court offers three additional reasons why respond-ents' recoveries should be taxed. First, it notes that
amounts awarded under Title VII would have been receivedas taxable wages if there had been no discrimination, leaving
the impression that failing to tax these recoveries wouldgive victims of employment discrimination a windfall. See
ante, at 241, and n. 13. Affording victims of employmentdiscrimination this benefit, however, simply puts them on an
equal footing with others who suffer personal injury. Forexample, "[i]f a taxpayer receives a damage award for a
physical injury, which almost by definition is personal, theentire award is excluded from income even if all or a part of
the recovery is determined with reference to the income lostbecause of the injury."

inequity in treating Title VII litigants like other plaintiffswho suffer personal injury.

Second, the Court intimates that the unavailability of jurytrials to Title VII plaintiffs bears on determining the nature
of the claim they bring. See ante, at 240, 241, n. 12. Here,
the Court apparently assumes the answer to a question wehave expressly declined to address on recent occasions. See

Lytle v. Household Mfg., Inc., 494 U. S. 545, 549, n. 1 (1990)("This Court has not ruled on the question whether a plaintiff seeking relief under Title VII has a right to a jurytrial. . . . [W]e express no opinion on that issue here");

Teamsters v. Terry, 494 U. S. 558, 572 (1990). More importantly,
the Court does not explain what relevance the availability
of jury trials holds for the question of excludability under

$ 104(a)(2). The suggestion is that Title VII recoveries are
not excludable under this section because employment discrimination suits are equitable rather than legal in nature.

F. 2d 434 (1991). That argument, however, ignores the very
IRS regulation the Court purports to apply. Instead of construing the statutory term "damages" as a reference to the
remedy traditionally available in actions at law, the IRS defines "damages" to mean "an amount" recovered through
prosecution or settlement of a "legal suit or action based
upon tort or tort type rights." 26 CFR $ 1.104-1(c) (1991)
(emphasis added). This inclusive definition renders the historical incidents of "actions at law" and "suits in equity" irrelevant to the proper interpretation of $ 104(a)(2).

Finally, the Court asserts that Congress fundamentally
changed the nature of a Title VII suit when it enacted the
Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071.
By authorizing compensatory and punitive damages in addition to backpay and injunctive relief, the Court suggests,
Congress extended the statute's scope beyond purely economic losses to personal injury. See ante, at 241, n. 12.
This theory is odd on its face, for even before the 1991

O'Connor, J., dissenting
amendments Title VII reached much more than discrimina-tion in the economic aspects of employment. The protection

afforded under Title VII has always been expansive, extend-ing not just to economic inequality, but also to " `working
environments so heavily polluted with discrimination as todestroy completely the emotional and psychological stability
of minority group workers' " and " `demeaning and discon-certing' " conditions of employment.

Meritor Sav. Bank,FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57, 66, 67 (1986) (quoting Rogers v.

EEOC, 454 F. 2d 234, 238 (CA5 1971), cert. denied, 406 U. S.957 (1972); Henson v. Dundee, 682 F. 2d 897, 902 (CA11
1982)).Given the historic reach of Title VII, Congress' decision to
authorize comparably broad remedies most naturally sug-gests that legislators thought existing penalties insufficient
to effectuate the law's settled purposes. There is no needto guess whether Congress had a new conception of injury
in mind, however. The Legislature set out the reason fornew remedies in the statute itself, explaining that "additional
remedies under Federal law are needed to deter unlawfulharassment and intentional discrimination in the workplace."
Pub. L. 102-166, $ 2, 105 Stat. 1071. This authoritativeevidence that Congress added new penalties principally to
effectuate an established goal of Title VII, not contrary spec-ulation, should guide our decision.

By resting on the remedies available under Title VII anddistinguishing the recently amended version of that law, the
Court does make today's decision a narrow one. Neverthe-less, I remain of the view that Title VII offers a tort-like
cause of action to those who suffer the injury of employmentdiscrimination. See

Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S.,at 264-265 (
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). Forthis reason, I respectfully dissent.

255OCTOBER TERM, 1991
Syllabus

EVANS v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 90-6105. Argued December 9, 1991--Decided May 26, 1992
As part of an investigation of allegations of public corruption in Georgia, a

Federal Bureau of Investigation agent posing as a real estate developer
initiated a number of conversations with petitioner Evans, an elected
member of the DeKalb County Board of Commissioners. The agent
sought Evans' assistance in an effort to rezone a tract of land and gave
him, inter alia, $7,000 in cash, which Evans failed to report on his state
campaign-financing disclosure form or his federal income tax return.
Evans was convicted in the District Court of, among other things, extortion under the Hobbs Act, which is "the obtaining of property from
another, . . . induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force,
violence, or fear, or under color of official right," 18 U. S. C. $ 1951(b)(2).
In affirming the conviction, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the
trial court's jury instruction did not require a finding that Evans had
demanded or requested the money, or that he had conditioned the performance of any official act upon its receipt. However, it held that "passive acceptance of the benefit" was sufficient for a Hobbs Act violation
if the public official knew that he was being offered the payment in
exchange for a specific requested exercise of his official power.

Held: An affirmative act of inducement by a public official, such as a demand, is not an element of the offense of extortion "under color of official
right" prohibited by the Hobbs Act. Pp. 259-271.

(a) Congress is presumed to have adopted the common-law definition
of extortion--which does not require that a public official make a demand or request--unless it has instructed otherwise. See Morissette
v. United States, 342 U. S. 246, 263. While the Act expanded the
common-law definition to encompass conduct by a private individual as
well as a public official, the portion of the Act referring to official misconduct continues to mirror the common-law definition. There is nothing
in the sparse legislative history or the statutory text that could fairly
be described as a "contrary direction," ibid., from Congress to narrow
the offense's scope. The inclusion of the word "induced" in the definition does not require that the wrongful use of official power begin with
a public official. That word is part of the definition of extortion by a
private individual but not by a public official, and even if it did apply to

256 EVANS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
a public official, it does not necessarily indicate that a transaction must
be initiated by the bribe's recipient. Pp. 259-266.

(b) Evans' criticisms of the jury instruction--that it did not properly
describe the quid pro quo requirement for conviction if the jury found
that the payment was a campaign contribution, and that it did not require the jury to find duress--are rejected. The instruction satisfies
the quid pro quo requirement of McCormick v. United States, 500 U. S.
257, because the offense is completed when the public official receives
payment in return for his agreement to perform specific official acts;
fulfillment of the quid pro quo is not an element of the offense. Nor is
an affirmative step on the official's part an element of the offense on
which an instruction need be given. Pp. 267-268.

(c) The conclusion herein is buttressed by the facts that many courts
have interpreted the statute in the same way, and that Congress, although aware of this prevailing view, has remained silent. Pp. 268-269.

We granted certiorari, 500 U.

S. C. $ 1951.We agree with the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit
that it is not, and therefore affirm the judgment of thecourt below.

Opinion of the Court

I
Petitioner was an elected member of the Board of Commissioners of DeKalb County, Georgia. During the period between March 1985 and October 1986, as part of an effort by
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate allegations of public corruption in the Atlanta area, particularly in the area of rezonings of property, an FBI agent posing as a real estate developer talked on the telephone and
met with petitioner on a number of occasions. Virtually all,
if not all, of those conversations were initiated by the agent
and most were recorded on tape or video. In those conversations, the agent sought petitioner's assistance in an effort
to rezone a 25-acre tract of land for high-density residential
use. On July 25, 1986, the agent handed petitioner cash totaling $7,000 and a check, payable to petitioner's campaign,
for $1,000. Petitioner reported the check, but not the cash,
on his state campaign-financing disclosure form; he also did
not report the $7,000 on his 1986 federal income tax return.
Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, as we must in light of the verdict, see Glasser v.
United States, 315 U. S. 60, 80 (1942), we assume that the
jury found that petitioner accepted the cash knowing that it
was intended to ensure that he would vote in favor of the
rezoning application and that he would try to persuade his
fellow commissioners to do likewise. Thus, although petitioner did not initiate the transaction, his acceptance of the
bribe constituted an implicit promise to use his official position to serve the interests of the bribegiver.

In a two-count indictment, petitioner was charged with extortion in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 1951 and with failure to
report income in violation of 26 U. S. C. $ 7206(1). He was
convicted by a jury on both counts. With respect to the extortion count, the trial judge gave the following instruction:

"The defendant contends that the $8,000 he received
from agent Cormany was a campaign contribution. The

504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT
258 EVANS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
solicitation of campaign contributions from any person
is a necessary and permissible form of political activity
on the part of persons who seek political office and persons who have been elected to political office. Thus, the
acceptance by an elected official of a campaign contribution does not, in itself, constitute a violation of the Hobbs
Act even though the donor has business pending before
the official.

"However, if a public official demands or accepts
money in exchange for [a] specific requested exercise of
his or her official power, such a demand or acceptance
does constitute a violation of the Hobbs Act regardless
of whether the payment is made in the form of a campaign contribution." App. 16-17.

In affirming petitioner's conviction, the Court of Appeals
noted that the instruction did not require the jury to find
that petitioner had demanded or requested the money, or
that he had conditioned the performance of any official act
upon its receipt. 910 F. 2d 790, 796 (CA11 1990). The
Court of Appeals held, however, that "passive acceptance of
a benefit by a public official is sufficient to form the basis of
a Hobbs Act violation if the official knows that he is being
offered the payment in exchange for a specific requested exercise of his official power. The official need not take any
specific action to induce the offering of the benefit." Ibid.
(emphasis in original).1

This statement of the law by the Court of Appeals for the
Eleventh Circuit is consistent with holdings in eight other

1 The Court of Appeals explained its conclusion as follows:
"[T]he requirement of inducement is automatically satisfied by the power
connected with the public office. Therefore, once the defendant has
shown that a public official has accepted money in return for a requested
exercise of official power, no additional inducement need be shown. `The
coercive nature of the official office provides all the inducement necessary.' " 910 F. 2d, at 796-797 (footnote omitted).

Opinion of the Court
Circuits.2 Two Circuits, however, have held that an affirm-ative act of inducement by the public official is required to

support a conviction of extortion under color of official right.United States v. O'Grady, 742 F. 2d 682, 687 (CA2 1984) (en
banc) ("Although receipt of benefits by a public official is anecessary element of the crime, there must also be proof that
the public official did something, under color of his publicoffice, to cause the giving of benefits");

United States v.Aguon, 851 F. 2d 1158, 1166 (CA9 1988) (en banc) ("We find

ourselves in accord with the Second Circuit's conclusion thatinducement is an element required for conviction under the
Hobbs Act"). Because the majority view is consistent withthe common-law definition of extortion, which we believe
Congress intended to adopt, we endorse that position.

It is a familiar "maxim that a statutory term is gener-ally presumed to have its common-law meaning." Taylor v.

ture from them." Morissette v. United States, 342 U. S. 246,263 (1952).

At common law, extortion was an offense committed by apublic official who took "by colour of his office"

4 money that

was not due to him for the performance of his official duties.5A demand, or request, by the public official was not an element of the offense.6 Extortion by the public official wasthe rough equivalent of what we would now describe as "taking a bribe." It is clear that petitioner committed that of-fense.

7 The question is whether the federal statute, insofar

3 Or, as Justice Frankfurter advised, "if a word is obviously transplanted
from another legal source, whether the common law or other legislation,
it brings the old soil with it." Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the
Reading of Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 537 (1947).

4 Blackstone described extortion as "an abuse of public justice, which

consists in an officer's unlawfully taking, by colour of his office, from any
man, any money or thing of value, that is not due to him, or more than is
due, or before it is due." 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *141 (emphasis
added). He used the phrase "by colour of his office," rather than the
phrase "under color of official right," which appears in the Hobbs Act.
Petitioner does not argue that there is any difference in the phrases. Hawkins' definition of extortion is probably the source for the official right
language used in the Hobbs Act. See Lindgren, The Elusive Distinction
Between Bribery and Extortion: From the Common Law to the Hobbs
Act, 35 UCLA L. Rev. 815, 864 (1988) (hereinafter Lindgren). Hawkins
defined extortion as follows:

"[I]t is said, That extortion in a large sense signifies any oppression under
colour of right; but that in a strict sense, it signifies the taking of money
by any officer, by colour of his office, either where none at all is due, or
not so much is due, or where it is not yet due." 1 W. Hawkins, Pleas of
the Crown 316 (6th ed. 1787).

5 See Lindgren 882-889. The dissent says that we assume that

"common-law extortion encompassed any taking by a public official of
something of value that he was not `due.' " Post, at 279. That statement,
of course, is incorrect because, as stated in the text above, the payment
must be "for the performance of his official duties."

6 Lindgren 884-886.

7 Petitioner argued to the jury, at least with respect to the extortion

count, that he had been entrapped, see App. 20; however, in light of the
jury's verdict on that issue, we must assume that he was predisposed to
commit the crime.

Opinion of the Court
as it applies to official extortion, has narrowed the common-law definition.

Congress has unquestionably expanded the common-lawdefinition of extortion to include acts by private individuals
pursuant to which property is obtained by means of force,fear, or threats. It did so by implication in the Travel Act,
18 U. S. C. $ 1952, see United States v. Nardello, 393 U. S.286, 289-296 (1969), and expressly in the Hobbs Act. The
portion of the Hobbs Act that is relevant to our decisiontoday provides:

"(a) Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays,or affects commerce or the movement of any article or
commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or at-tempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens
physical violence to any person or property in further-ance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation
of this section shall be fined not more than $10,000 orimprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.

"(b) As used in this section--. . . . .
"(2) The term `extortion' means the obtaining of prop-erty from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, orunder color of official right." 18 U. S. C. $ 1951.

The present form of the statute is a codification of a 1946enactment, the Hobbs Act,

8 which amended the federal AntiRacketeering Act.9 In crafting the 1934 Act, Congress was

8 The 1946 enactment provides:
"The term `extortion' means the obtaining of property from another,

Opinion of the Court
careful not to interfere with legitimate activities betweenemployers and employees. See H. R. Rep. No. 1833, 73d

Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1934). The 1946 amendment was in-tended to encompass the conduct held to be beyond the reach
of the 1934 Act by our decision in United States v. Teamsters,315 U. S. 521 (1942).

10 The amendment did not make any

significant change in the section referring to obtaining prop-erty "under color of official right" that had been prohibited

by the 1934 Act. Rather, Congress intended to broaden thescope of the Anti-Racketeering Act and was concerned pri"(b) Obtains the property of another, with his consent, induced by
wrongful use of force or fear, or under color of official right." Act of June
18, 1934, ch. 569, $ 2, 48 Stat. 979-980.

One of the models for the statute was the New York statute:
"Extortion is the obtaining of property from another, or the obtaining
the [sic] property of a corporation from an officer, agent or employee
thereof, with his consent, induced by a wrongful use of force or fear, or
under color of official right." Penal Law of 1909, $ 850, as amended, 1917
N. Y. Laws, ch. 518, codified in N. Y. Penal Law $ 850 (McKinney Supp.
1965).

The other model was the Field Code, a 19th-century model code:
"Extortion is the obtaining of property from another, with his consent,
induced by a wrongful use of force or fear, or under color of official right."
Commissioners of the Code, Proposed Penal Code of the State of New
York $ 613 (1865) (Field Code).

Lindgren points out that according to the Field Code, coercive extortion
and extortion by official right extortion are separate offenses, and the New
York courts recognized this difference when, in 1891, they said the Field
Code treats "extortion by force and fear as one thing, and extortion by
official action as another." People v. Barondess, 61 Hun. 571, 576, 16
N. Y. S. 436, 438 (App. Div. 1891). The judgment in this case was later
reversed without opinion. See 133 N. Y. 649, 31 N. E. 240 (1892). Lindgren identifies early English statutes and cases to support his contention
that official extortion did not require a coercive taking, nor did it under
the early American statutes, including the later New York statute. See
Lindgren 869, 908.

10 In United States v. Teamsters, the Court construed the exemption for

" `the payment of wages by a bona-fide employer to a bona-fide employee' "
that was contained in the 1934 Act but is no longer a part of the statute.

marily with distinguishing between "legitimate" labor activity and labor "racketeering," so as to prohibit the latter while
permitting the former. See 91 Cong. Rec. 11899-11922
(1945).

Many of those who supported the amendment argued that
its purpose was to end the robbery and extortion that some
union members had engaged in, to the detriment of all labor
and the American citizenry. They urged that the amendment was not, as their opponents charged, an antilabor measure, but rather, it was a necessary measure in the wake of
this Court's decision in United States v. Teamsters.11 In
their view, the Supreme Court had mistakenly exempted
labor from laws prohibiting robbery and extortion, whereas
Congress had intended to extend such laws to all American
citizens. See, e. g., 91 Cong. Rec. 11910 (1945) (remarks of
Rep. Springer) ("To my mind this is a bill that protects the
honest laboring people in our country. There is nothing contained in this bill that relates to labor. This measure, if
passed, will relate to every American citizen"); id., at 11912
(remarks of Rep. Jennings) ("The bill is one to protect the
right of citizens of this country to market their products
without any interference from lawless bandits").

Although the present statutory text is much broader 12
than the common-law definition of extortion because it encompasses conduct by a private individual as well as conduct

11 In fact, the House Report sets out the text of United States v. Teamsters in full, to make clear that the amendment to the Anti-Racketeering
Act was in direct response to the Supreme Court decision. See H. R.
Rep. No. 238, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 1-10 (1945).

12 This Court recognized the broad scope of the Hobbs Act in Stirone v.

United States, 361 U. S. 212, 215 (1960):
"That Act speaks in broad language, manifesting a purpose to use all the
constitutional power Congress has to punish interference with interstate
commerce by extortion, robbery or physical violence. The Act outlaws
such interference `in any way or degree.' "

264 EVANS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
by a public official,13 the portion of the statute that refers
to official misconduct continues to mirror the common-law
definition. There is nothing in either the statutory text or
the legislative history that could fairly be described as a
"contrary direction," Morissette v. United States, 342 U. S.,
at 263, from Congress to narrow the scope of the offense.

The legislative history is sparse and unilluminating with
respect to the offense of extortion. There is a reference to
the fact that the terms "robbery and extortion" had been
construed many times by the courts and to the fact that the
definitions of those terms were "based on the New York
law." 89 Cong. Rec. 3227 (1943) (statement of Rep. Hobbs);
see 91 Cong. Rec. 11906 (1945) (statement of Rep. Robsion).
In view of the fact that the New York statute applied to a
public officer "who asks, or receives, or agrees to receive"
unauthorized compensation, N. Y. Penal Code $ 557 (1881),
the reference to New York law is consistent with an intent
to apply the common-law definition. The language of the
New York statute quoted above makes clear that extortion
could be committed by one who merely received an unauthor13 Several States had already defined the offense of extortion broadly
enough to include the conduct of the private individual as well as the
conduct of the public official. See, e. g., United States v. Nardello, 393
U. S. 286, 289 (1969) ("In many States . . . the crime of extortion has been
statutorily expanded to include acts by private individuals under which
property is obtained by means of force, fear, or threats"); Bush v. State,
19 Ariz. 195, 198, 168 P. 508, 509-510 (1917) (recognizing that the state
Penal Code "has enlarged the scope of this offense so as not to confine the
commission of it to those persons who act under color of official right");
People v. Peck, 43 Cal. App. 638, 643, 185 P. 881, 882-883 (1919) (In some
States "the statutory definitions have extended the scope of the offense
beyond that of the common law so as to include the unlawful taking of
money or thing of value of another by any person, whether a public officer
or a private individual, and this is so in California . . .").

At least one commentator has argued that, at common law, extortion
under color of official right could also be committed by a private individual.
See Lindgren 875.

Opinion of the Court
ized payment.14 This was the statute that was in force in
New York when the Hobbs Act was enacted.

The two courts that have disagreed with the decision to
apply the common-law definition have interpreted the word
"induced" as requiring a wrongful use of official power that
"begins with the public official, not with the gratuitous actions of another." United States v. O'Grady, 742 F. 2d, at
691; see United States v. Aguon, 851 F. 2d, at 1166 (" `inducement' can be in the overt form of a `demand,' or in a more
subtle form such as `custom' or `expectation' "). If we had
no common-law history to guide our interpretation of the
statutory text, that reading would be plausible. For two
reasons, however, we are convinced that it is incorrect.

First, we think the word "induced" is a part of the definition of the offense by the private individual, but not the offense by the public official. In the case of the private individual, the victim's consent must be "induced by wrongful
use of actual or threatened force, violence or fear." In the
case of the public official, however, there is no such requirement. The statute merely requires of the public official that
he obtain "property from another, with his consent, . . . under
color of official right." The use of the word "or" before
"under color of official right" supports this reading.15

14 Many of the treatise writers explained that, at common law, extortion
was defined as the corrupt taking or receipt of an unlawful fee by a public
officer under color of office. They did not allude to any requirements of
"inducement" or "demand" by a public officer. See, e. g., W. LaFave &
A. Scott, Handbook on Criminal Law $ 95, p. 704 (1972); R. Perkins &
R. Boyce, Criminal Law 448 (1982); 4 C. Torcia, Wharton's Criminal Law

$ 695, p. 481, $ 698, p. 484 (14th ed. 1981).

15 This meaning would, of course, have been completely clear if Congress

had inserted the word "either" before its description of the private offense
because the word "or" already precedes the description of the public offense. The definition would then read: "The term `extortion' means the
obtaining of property from another, with his consent, either induced by
wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color
of official right."

266 EVANS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Second, even if the statute were parsed so that the word"induced" applied to the public officeholder, we do not believe

the word "induced" necessarily indicates that the transactionmust be

initiated by the recipient of the bribe. Many of
the cases applying the majority rule have concluded that the
wrongful acceptance of a bribe establishes all the inducement that the statute requires.16 They conclude that the coercive element is provided by the public office itself. And
even the two courts that have adopted an inducement requirement for extortion under color of official right do not
require proof that the inducement took the form of a threat
or demand. See United States v. O'Grady, 742 F. 2d, at 687;
United States v. Aguon, 851 F. 2d, at 1166.17

16 See, e. g., United States v. Holzer, 816 F. 2d 304, 311 (CA7), vacated on
other grounds, 484 U. S. 807 (1987), aff'd in part on remand, 840 F. 2d 1343
(CA7), cert. denied, 486 U. S. 1035 (1988); United States v. Paschall, 772
F. 2d 68, 72-74 (CA4 1985); United States v. Williams, 621 F. 2d, at 124;
United States v. Butler, 618 F. 2d, at 418.

17 Moreover, we note that while the statute does not require that affirmative inducement be proven as a distinct element of the Hobbs Act,
there is evidence in the record establishing that petitioner received the
money with the understanding that he would use his office to aid the bribegiver. Petitioner and the agent had several exchanges in which they tried
to clarify their understanding with each other. For example, petitioner
said to the agent: "I understand both of us are groping . . . for what we
need to say to each other. . . . I'm gonna work. Let m[e] tell you I'm
gonna work, if you didn't give me but three [thousand dollars], on this,
I've promised to help you. I'm gonna work to do that. You understand
what I mean. . . . If you gave me six, I'll do exactly what I said I was
gonna do for you. If you gave me one, I'll do exactly what I said I was
gonna do for you. I wanna' make sure you're clear on that part. So it
doesn't really matter. If I promised to help, that's what I'm gonna do."
App. 36-37.

Petitioner instructed the agent on the form of the payment ("What you
do, is make me out one, ahh, for a thousand. . . . And, and that means we
gonna record it and report it and then the rest would be cash"), and agreed
with the agent that the payment was being made, not because it was an
election year, but because there was a budget to support petitioner's ac504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
Petitioner argues that the jury charge with respect to ex-tortion, see supra, at 257-258, allowed the jury to convict

him on the basis of the "passive acceptance of a contribu-tion." Brief for Petitioner 24.

18 He contends that the instruction did not require the jury to find "an element of dutions, and that there would be a budget either way ("Either way, yep.
Oh, I understand that. I understand"). Id., at 38.

18 Petitioner also makes the point that "[t]he evidence at trial against

[petitioner] is more conducive to a charge of bribery than one of extortion."
Brief for Petitioner 40. Although the evidence in this case may have supported a charge of bribery, it is not a defense to a charge of extortion
under color of official right that the defendant could also have been convicted of bribery. Courts addressing extortion by force or fear have occasionally said that extortion and bribery are mutually exclusive, see, e. g.,
People v. Feld, 262 App. Div. 909, 28 N. Y. S. 2d 796, 797 (1941); while that
may be correct when the victim was intimidated into making a payment
(extortion by force or fear), and did not offer it voluntarily (bribery), that
does not lead to the conclusion that extortion under color of official right
and bribery are mutually exclusive under either common law or the Hobbs
Act. See, e. g., Stern, Prosecutions of Local Political Corruption Under
the Hobbs Act: The Unnecessary Distinction Between Bribery and Extortion, 3 Seton Hall L. Rev. 1, 14 (1971) ("If the [Hobbs] Act is read in full,
the distinction between bribery and extortion becomes unnecessary where
public officials are involved").

Another commentator has argued that bribery and extortion were overlapping crimes, see Lindgren 905, 908, and has located an early New York
case in which the defendant was convicted of both bribery and extortion
under color of official right, see People v. Hansen, 241 N. Y. 532, 150 N. E.
542 (1925), aff'g, 211 App. Div. 861, 207 N. Y. S. 894 (1924). He also makes
the point that the cases usually cited for the proposition that extortion
and bribery are mutually exclusive crimes are cases involving extortion
by fear and bribery, see, e. g., People v. Feld, supra; People v. Dioguardi,
8 N. Y. 2d 260, 263, 271-273, 168 N. E. 2d 683, 685, 690-692 (1960), and we
note that the latter case was decided after the Hobbs Act, so it could not
have been a case on which Congress relied. We agree with the Seventh
Circuit in United States v. Braasch, 505 F. 2d 139, 151, n. 7 (1974), cert.
denied, 421 U. S. 910 (1975), that " `the modern trend of the federal courts
is to hold that bribery and extortion as used in the Hobbs Ac[t] are not
mutually exclusive. United States v. Kahn, 472 F. 2d 272, 278 (2d Cir.
1973), cert. den., 411 U. S. 982.' "

Opinion of the Court
ress such as a demand," id., at 22, and it did not properlydescribe the quid pro quo requirement for conviction if the

jury found that the payment was a campaign contribution.We reject petitioner's criticism of the instruction, and conclude that it satisfies the quid pro quo requirement of McCormick v. United States, 500 U. S. 257 (1991), because theoffense is completed at the time when the public official receives a payment in return for his agreement to performspecific official acts; fulfillment of the quid pro quo is not an
element of the offense. We also reject petitioner's conten-tion that an affirmative step is an element of the offense of
extortion "under color of official right" and need be includedin the instruction.

19 As we explained above, our construction of the statute is informed by the common-law traditionfrom which the term of art was drawn and understood. We

hold today that the Government need only show that a publicofficial has obtained a payment to which he was not entitled,
knowing that the payment was made in return for officialacts.

20

Our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that so many othercourts that have considered the issue over the last 20 years

have interpreted the statute in the same way.21 Moreover,

19 We do not reach petitioner's second claim pertaining to the tax fraud
count because, as petitioner conceded at oral argument, we would only
have to reach that claim in the event that petitioner succeeded on his
Hobbs Act claim. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 3-4, 27.

20 The dissent states that we have "simply made up," post, at 286, the

requirement that the payment must be given in return for official acts.
On the contrary, that requirement is derived from the statutory language
"under color of official right," which has a well-recognized common-law
heritage that distinguished between payments for private services and
payments for public services. See, e. g., Collier v. State, 55 Ala. 125
(1877), which the dissent describes as a "typical case." Post, at 281.

21 See, e. g., United States v. Swift, 732 F. 2d 878, 880 (CA11 1984), cert.

Opinion of the Court
given the number of appellate court decisions, together withthe fact that many of them have involved prosecutions of

important officials well known in the political community,22 itis obvious that Congress is aware of the prevailing view that
common-law extortion is proscribed by the Hobbs Act. Thesilence of the body that is empowered to give us a "contrary
direction" if it does not want the common-law rule to surviveis consistent with an application of the normal presumption
identified in Taylor and Morissette.

III
An argument not raised by petitioner is now advanced bythe dissent. It contends that common-law extortion was

limited to wrongful takings under a false pretense of officialright.

Post, at 279-280; see post, at 281 (offense of extortion"was understood . . . [as] a wrongful taking under a false

pretense of official right") (emphasis in original); post, at 282.It is perfectly clear, however, that although extortion accomplished by fraud was a well-recognized type of extortion,there were other types as well. As the court explained in
Commonwealth v. Wilson, 30 Pa. Super. 26 (1906), an extor-tion case involving a payment by a would-be brothel owner
to a police captain to ensure the opening of her house:

"The form of extortion most commonly dealt with in thedecisions is the corrupt taking by a person in office of a

States v. Braasch, 505 F. 2d, at 151.

22 For example, in United States v. Hall, supra, the Governor of Oklahoma was convicted of extorting money "under color of official right," in
violation of the Hobbs Act; in United States v. Kenny, 462 F. 2d 1205, 1211
(CA3 1972), each of the eight defendants, who was part of a scheme to
interfere with interstate commerce in violation of the Hobbs Act, "was, or
had been, a highly placed public official or political leader in Jersey City
or Hudson County or both"; and in United States v. Jannotti, 673 F. 2d, at
578, the Government operation, which came to be known as ABSCAM, led
to the trial and conviction of various local and federal public officials,
which, in other phases of the operation, included several Congressmen.

fee for services which should be rendered gratuitously;or when compensation is permissible, of a larger fee than

the law justifies, or a fee not yet due; but this is not acomplete definition of the offense, by which I mean that
it does not include every form of common-law extor-tion."

Id., at 30.

See also Commonwealth v. Brown, 23 Pa. Super. 470, 488-489 (1903) (defendants charged with and convicted of conspiracy to extort because they accepted pay for obtaining andprocuring the election of certain persons to the position of
schoolteachers); State v. Sweeney, 180 Minn. 450, 456, 231N. W. 225, 228 (1930) (alderman's acceptance of money for
the erection of a barn, the running of a gambling house, andthe opening of a filling station would constitute extortion)
(dicta); State v. Barts, 132 N. J. L. 74, 76, 83, 38 A. 2d 838,841, 844 (Sup. Ct. 1944) (police officer, who received $1,000
for not arresting someone who had stolen money, was prop-erly convicted of extortion because "generically extortion is
an abuse of public justice and a misuse by oppression of thepower with which the law clothes a public officer"); White v.
State, 56 Ga. 385, 389 (1876) (If a ministerial officer used hisposition "for the purpose of awing or seducing" a person to
pay him a bribe that would be extortion).The dissent's theory notwithstanding, not one of the cases
it cites, see post, at 281-282, and n. 3, holds that the publicofficial is innocent unless he has deceived the payor by representing that the payment was proper. Indeed, none makesany reference to the state of mind of the payor, and none
states that a "false pretense" is an element of the offense.Instead, those cases merely support the proposition that the
services for which the fee is paid must be official and thatthe official must not be entitled to the fee that he collected--
both elements of the offense that are clearly satisfied in thiscase. The complete absence of support for the dissent's thesis presumably explains why it was not advanced by peti-tioner in the District Court or the Court of Appeals, is not

recognized by any Court of Appeals, and is not advanced inany scholarly commentary.

23

The judgment is affirmed. It is so ordered.

23 Moreover, the dissent attempts to have it both ways in its use of
common-law history. It wants to draw an artificial line and say that we
should only look at American common law and not at the more ancient
English common law (even though the latter provided the roots for the
former), see post, at 280-281, and at the same time, it criticizes the Court
for relying on a " `modern' view of extortion," post, at 285-286, n. 4; it also
uses a 1961 case, which was decided 15 years after the enactment of the
Hobbs Act, to explain the American view of the common-law crime of
extortion at the time of the Act, see ibid., even though it claims that we
are only supposed to look at "the American understanding of the crime
at the time the Hobbs Act was passed in 1946." Post, at 281. Moreover,
the 1961 case that it cites, State v. Begyn, 34 N. J. 35, 46, 167 A. 2d 161,
166, in which a sanitary inspector was charged with extortion for accepting payments by a scavenger who held a garbage removal contract and
who made payments in order to ensure the continuation of the contract,
merely supports the proposition that extortion was not limited to the overpayment of fees. The common-law crime of extortion was broader than
the dissent now attempts to paint it, and in any of the historical periods
to which the dissent wants to point there are cases that are contrary to
the dissent's narrow view. For "modern" cases, see Begyn, supra, and

State v. Barts, 132 N. J. L. 74, 38 A. 2d 838 (1944); for early American
common-law cases, see supra, at 269-270; and for English common-law
cases, see, e. g., 36 Lincoln Record Society, A Lincolnshire Assize Roll for
1298, p. 74, no. 322 (W. Thomson ed. 1944) (Adam of Lung (1298)) (was
convicted of extortion for accepting payment to spare a man from having
to contribute to an official collection of a quantity of malt); 10 Calendar of
Patent Rolls, Edward III, A. D. 1354-1358, p. 449 (1909) (Hugh de Elmeshale (1356)) (coroner would not perform his "office without great ransoms
and that he used to extort money from the people by false and feigned
indictments"); Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward II, A. D. 1313-1317,
pp. 681-682 (1898) (Robert de Somery (1317)) (Robert de Somery, commissioner of array for Worcester received money from men "in order that by
his connivance they might escape service and remain at home"); 1 Middlesex County Records (Old Series) 69 (J. Jeaffreson ed. 1886) (Smythe (1570))

of his office took extortionately" payments from the wagon owners to exonerate them from their obligations to the Queen).

272 EVANS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
Justice O'Connor, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.

I join Parts I and II of the Court's opinion, because in myview they correctly answer the question on which the Court
granted certiorari--whether or not an act of inducement isan element of the offense of extortion under color of official
right. See Pet. for Cert. i. The issue raised by the dissentand discussed in Part III of the Court's opinion is not fairly
included in this question, see this Court's Rule 14.1(a), andsound prudential reasons suggest that the Court should not
address it. Cf. Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 535-538(1992). Neither party in this case has briefed or argued the
question. A proper resolution of the issue requires a de-tailed examination of common law extortion cases, which in
turn requires intensive historical research. As there appearto be substantial arguments on either side, we would be far
more assured of arriving at the correct result were we toawait a case in which the issue had been addressed by the
parties. It is unfair to the United States to decide a case ona ground not raised by the petitioner and which the United
States has had no opportunity to address. For these rea-sons, I join neither the dissent nor Part III of the Court's
opinion, and I express no view as to which is correct.

Justice Kennedy, concurring in part and concurring inthe judgment.

The Court gives a summary of its decision in these words:
"We hold today that the Government need only show that apublic official has obtained a payment to which he was not

entitled, knowing that the payment was made in return for
official acts." Ante, at 268. In my view the dissent is cor-rect to conclude that this language requires a

quid pro quo
as an element of the Government's case in a prosecutionunder 18 U. S. C. $ 1951, see

post, at 285-287, and the Court's
opinion can be interpreted in a way that is consistent withthis rule. Although the Court appears to accept the re504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT

273Cite as: 504 U. S. 255 (1992)
Opinion of Kennedy, J.
quirement of a quid pro quo as an alternative rationale, inmy view this element of the offense is essential to a determination of those acts which are criminal and those which arenot in a case in which the official does not pretend that he is
entitled by law to the property in question. Here the prosecution did establish a quid pro quo that embodied the neces-sary elements of a statutory violation. I join Part III of

the Court's opinion and concur in the judgment affirming theconviction. I write this separate opinion to explain my analysis and understanding of the statute.With regard to the question whether the word "induced"
in the statutory definition of extortion applies to the phrase
"under color of official right," 18 U. S. C. $ 1951(b)(2), I find
myself in substantial agreement with the dissent. Scrutiny
of the placement of commas will not, in the final analysis,
yield a convincing answer, and we are left with two quite
plausible interpretations. Under these circumstances, I
agree with the dissent that the rule of lenity requires that
we avoid the harsher one. See post, at 289. We must take
as our starting point the assumption that the portion of the
statute at issue here defines extortion as "the obtaining of
property from another, with his consent, induced . . . under
color of official right."

I agree with the Court, on the other hand, that the word
"induced" does not "necessarily indicat[e] that the transaction must be initiated by the" public official. Ante, at 266
(emphasis in original). Something beyond the mere acceptance of property from another is required, however, or else
the word "induced" would be superfluous. That something,
I submit, is the quid pro quo. The ability of the official to
use or refrain from using authority is the "color of official
right" which can be invoked in a corrupt way to induce payment of money or to otherwise obtain property. The inducement generates a quid pro quo, under color of official right,
that the statute prohibits. The term "under color of " is
used, as I think both the Court and the dissent agree, to

504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT
274 EVANS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
sweep within the statute those corrupt exercises of authoritythat the law forbids but that nevertheless cause damage because the exercise is by a governmental official. Cf. Monroev.

Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 184 (1961) (" `Misuse of power, possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because
the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law, isaction taken `under color of ' state law' ") (quoting

United
States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299, 326 (1941)).The requirement of a

quid pro quo means that without
pretense of any entitlement to the payment, a public officialviolates $ 1951 if he intends the payor to believe that absent

payment the official is likely to abuse his office and his trust
to the detriment and injury of the prospective payor or to
give the prospective payor less favorable treatment if the
quid pro quo is not satisfied. The official and the payor need
not state the quid pro quo in express terms, for otherwise
the law's effect could be frustrated by knowing winks and
nods. The inducement from the official is criminal if it is
express or if it is implied from his words and actions, so long
as he intends it to be so and the payor so interprets it.

The criminal law in the usual course concerns itself with
motives and consequences, not formalities. And the trier of
fact is quite capable of deciding the intent with which words
were spoken or actions taken as well as the reasonable construction given to them by the official and the payor. See
McCormick v. United States, 500 U. S. 257, 270 (1991) ("It
goes without saying that matters of intent are for the jury
to consider"). In this respect a prosecution under the statute has some similarities to a contract dispute, with the
added and vital element that motive is crucial. For example, a quid pro quo with the attendant corrupt motive can be
inferred from an ongoing course of conduct. Cf. United
States v. O'Grady, 742 F. 2d 682, 694 (CA2 1984) (Pierce, J.,
concurring). In such instances, for a public official to commit extortion under color of official right, his course of dealings must establish a real understanding that failure to make

275Cite as: 504 U. S. 255 (1992)
Opinion of Kennedy, J.
a payment will result in the victimization of the prospectivepayor or the withholding of more favorable treatment, a victimization or withholding accomplished by taking or refrain-ing from taking official action, all in breach of the official's
trust. See Lindgren, The Elusive Distinction Between
Bribery and Extortion: From the Common Law to the HobbsAct, 35 UCLA L. Rev. 815, 887-888 (1988) (observing that

the offense of official extortion has always focused on publiccorruption).

Thus, I agree with the Court, that the quid pro quo re-quirement is not simply made up, as the dissent asserts.
Post, at 287. Instead, this essential element of the offense
is derived from the statutory requirement that the official
receive payment under color of official right, see ante, at 268,
n. 20, as well as the inducement requirement. And there
are additional principles of construction which justify this
interpretation. First is the principle that statutes are to
be construed so that they are constitutional. See Edward
J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Construction Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988), and cases
cited therein. As one Court of Appeals Judge who agreed
with the construction the Court today adopts noted, "the
phrase `under color of official right,' standing alone, is vague
almost to the point of unconstitutionality." United States v.
O'Grady, supra, at 695 (Van Graafeiland, J., concurring in
part and dissenting in part) (citing Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 498-499 (1982)).
By placing upon a criminal statute a narrow construction,
we avoid the possibility of imputing to Congress an enactment that lacks necessary precision.

Moreover, the mechanism which controls and limits the
scope of official right extortion is a familiar one: a state of
mind requirement. See Morissette v. United States, 342
U. S. 246 (1952) (refusing to impute to Congress the intent
to create a strict liability crime despite the absence of any
explicit mens rea requirement in the statute). Hence, even

504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:08 PAGES OPINPGT
276 EVANS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
if the quid pro quo requirement did not have firm roots inthe statutory language, it would constitute no abuse of judicial power for us to find it by implication.

Morissette legitimates the Court's decision in an additional
way. As both the Court and the dissent agree, compare
ante, at 260, n. 4, with post, at 288, n. 5, Congress' choice ofthe phrase "under color of official right" rather than "by colour of his office" does not reflect a substantive modificationof the common law. Instead, both the Court and dissent
conclude that the language at issue here must be interpretedin light of the familiar principle that absent any indication
otherwise, Congress meant its words to be interpreted in
light of the common law. Morissette, supra, at 263. As to
the meaning of the common law, I agree with the Court's
analysis and therefore join Part III of the Court's opinion.

While the dissent may well be correct that prior to the
enactment of the Hobbs Act a large number of the reported
official extortion cases in the United States happened to involve false pretenses, those cases do not so much as hint that
a false pretense of right was ever considered as an essential
element of the offense. See, e. g., People v. Whaley, 6 Cow.
661, 663-664 (N. Y. Sup. Ct. 1827) ("Extortion signifies, in an
enlarged sense, any oppression under color of right. In a
stricter sense, it signifies the taking of money by any officer,
by color of his office; either, where none at all is due, or not
so much due, or when it is not yet due"); Hanley v. State,
125 Wis. 396, 401-402, 104 N. W. 57, 59 (1905) ("The commonlaw offense of extortion is said `to be an abuse of public justice, which consists in any officer's unlawfully taking by color

is not due him, or more than is due him, or before it is due' ")
(quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *141). Furthermore, as the Court demonstrates, see ante, at 269-270, during the same period other American courts affirmed convictions of public officials for extortion based upon corrupt
receipt of payment absent any claim of right.

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
Morissette is relevant in one final respect. As I have indi-cated, and as the jury instructions in this case made clear,

an official violates the statute only if he agrees to receive apayment not due him in exchange for an official act, knowing
that he is not entitled to the payment. See App. 13 (requiring "wrongful use of otherwise valid official power"). Mod-ern courts familiar with the principle that only a clear congressional statement can create a strict liability offense, see
Morissette, supra, understand this fundamental limitation.
I point it out only because the express terms of the common-law definition of official extortion do not state the requirement that the official's intent be corrupt, see, e. g., Whaley,
supra, at 663-664; Hanley, supra, at 401-402, 104 N. W., at
59; Lindgren, 35 UCLA L. Rev., at 870-871 (setting forth six
colonial-era definitions of official extortion), and some courts
in this country appear to have taken the view that the
common-law offense had no mens rea requirement. See,
e. g., Commonwealth v. Bagley, 24 Mass. 279, 281 (1828)
(affirming the conviction "of an honest and meritorious public
officer, who by misapprehension of his rights [had] demanded
and received a lawful fee for a service not yet performed").
On the other hand, in other jurisdictions corrupt motive was
thought to be an element of the offense. E. g., Whaley,
supra, at 664 (remarking that the jury found that the defendant accepted payment "with the corrupt intent charged in
the indictment"). In any event, even if the rule had been
otherwise at common law, our modern jurisprudence would
require that there be a mens rea requirement now. In
short, a public official who labors under the good-faith but
erroneous belief that he is entitled to payment for an official
act does not violate the statute. That circumstance is not,
however, presented here.

The requirement of a quid pro quo in a $ 1951 prosecution
such as the one before us, in which it is alleged that money
was given to the public official in the form of a campaign
contribution, was established by our decision last Term in

Thomas, J., dissenting
McCormick v. United States, 500 U. S. 257 (1991). Readersof today's opinion should have little difficulty in understanding that the rationale underlying the Court's holding appliesnot only in campaign contribution cases, but in all $ 1951
prosecutions. That is as it should be, for, given a corruptmotive, the

quid pro quo, as I have said, is the essence ofthe offense.

Because I agree that the jury instruction in this case com-plied with the quid pro quo requirement, I concur in the
judgment of the Court.

Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Scalia join, dissenting.

The Court's analysis is based on the premise, with whichI fully agree, that when Congress employs legal terms of art,

it " `knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attachedto each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it
was taken and the meaning its use will convey to the judicialmind.' "

Ante, at 259 (quoting Morissette v. United States,342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952)). Thus, we presume, Congress

knew the meaning of common-law extortion when it enactedthe Hobbs Act, 18 U. S. C. $ 1951. Unfortunately, today's
opinion misapprehends that meaning and misconstrues thestatute. I respectfully dissent.

I
Extortion is one of the oldest crimes in Anglo-Americanjurisprudence. See 3 E. Coke, Institutes *541. Hawkins

provides the classic common-law definition: "[I]t is said, thatExtortion in a large Sense signifies any Oppression

under
Colour of Right; but that in a strict Sense it signifies theTaking of Money by any Officer, by Colour of his Office,

either where none at all is due, or not so much is due, orwhere it is not yet due." 1 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown
170 (2d ed. 1724) (emphasis added). Blackstone echoed thatdefinition: "[E]xtortion is an abuse of public justice, which

consists in any officer's unlawfully taking, by colour of hisoffice, from any man, any money or thing of value, that is not

due to him, or more than is due, or before it is due." 4 W.Blackstone, Commentaries 141 (1769) (emphasis added).

These definitions pose, but do not answer, the critical ques-tion: What does it mean for an official to take money "by
colour of his office"? The Court fails to address this ques-tion, simply assuming that common-law extortion encompassed any taking by a public official of something of valuethat he was not "due."

Ante, at 260.The "under color of office" element of extortion, however,

had a definite and well-established meaning at common law."At common law it was essential that the money or property
be obtained under color of office, that is, under the pretense
that the officer was entitled thereto by virtue of his office.The money or thing received must have been claimed or

accepted in right of office, and the person paying musthave yielded to official authority." 3 R. Anderson, Wharton's Criminal Law and Procedure $ 1393, pp. 790-791 (1957)(emphasis added).

1 Thus, although the Court purports to

1 That was straightforward black-letter law at the time the Hobbs Act
was passed in 1946, and continues to be straightforward black-letter law
today. See, e. g., 1 W. Burdick, Law of Crime $ 275, p. 395 (1946) ("At
common law, the money or other thing of value must be taken under color
of office. That is, the service rendered, or to be rendered, or pretended
to have been rendered, must be apparently, or pretended to be, within
official power or authority, and the money must be taken in such an
apparent or claimed capacity") (emphasis added; footnotes omitted); 31A
Am. Jur. 2d $ 11, p. 600 (1989) ("In order to constitute extortion, the taking
must take place under color of office--that is, under the pretense that the
officer is entitled to the fee by virtue of his or her office. This requires
that the service rendered must be apparently, or pretended to be, within
official power or authority, and the money must be taken in such apparent
or claimed authority") (emphasis added; footnotes omitted). Cf. 7 Cyclopedia of Law and Procedure 401-402 (1903) (defining "color of office" as "a

define official extortion under the Hobbs Act by referenceto the common law, its definition bears scant resemblance

to the common-law crime Congress presumably codified in1946.

A
The Court's historical analysis rests upon a theory setforth in one law review article. See

ante, at 260, and nn. 4-6(citing Lindgren, The Elusive Distinction Between Bribery

and Extortion: From the Common Law to the Hobbs Act, 35UCLA L. Rev. 815 (1988)). Focusing on early English cases,
the article argues that common-law extortion encompasseda wide range of official takings, whether by coercion, false
pretenses, or bribery. Whatever the merits of that argu-ment as a description of early English common law,

2 it is

pretext or cover for the commission of some corrupt or vicious act; an act
evilly done, by the countenance of an office; an act unjustly done by the
countenance of an office; an act wrongfully done by an officer under the
pretended authority of his office; and is always taken in the worst sense,
being grounded upon corruption, of which the office is as a mere shadow
or color; under statutes, the phrase is used to define an illegal claim of
right or authority to take the security; some illegal exertion of authority,
whereby an obligation is extorted which the statute does not require to
be given") (footnotes omitted).

2 Those merits are far from clear. Most commentators maintain that

extortion and bribery were distinct crimes at early English common law.
See, e. g., J. Noonan, Bribes 398, 585-587 (1984); Ruff, Federal Prosecution
of Local Corruption: A Case Study in the Making of Law Enforcement
Policy, 65 Geo. L. J. 1171, 1179-1180 (1977). While--as I explain below--
Professor Lindgren may well be correct that common-law extortion did
not contain an "inducement" element, in my view he does not adequately
account for the crime's "by color of office" element. This latter element
has existed since long before the founding of the Republic, and cannot
simply be ignored. As Chief Justice Mountague explained over four centuries ago, colore officii sui ("by color of his office") "signifies an Act badly
done under the Countenance of an Office, and it bears a dissembling Visage of Duty, and is properly called Extortion." Dive v. Maningham, 1
Plowd. 60, 68, 75 Eng. Rep. 96, 108 (C. B. 1550) (emphasis added). See

beside the point here--the critical inquiry for our purposesis the American understanding of the crime at the time the

Hobbs Act was passed in 1946. Cf. Harmelin v. Michigan,501 U. S. 957, 975 (1991) (plurality opinion) (English historical background is relevant in determining the meaningof a constitutional provision, but the "ultimate question"
is the meaning of that provision to the Americans whoadopted it).

A survey of 19th- and early 20th-century cases construingstate extortion statutes in light of the common law makes
plain that the offense was understood to involve not merelya wrongful taking by a public official, but a wrongful taking
under a false pretense of official right. A typical case isCollier v. State, 55 Ala. 125 (1877). The defendant there was
a local prosecutor who, for a fee, had given legal advice to acriminal suspect. The Alabama Supreme Court rejected
the State's contention that the defendant's receipt of thefee--even though improper--amounted to "extortion," because he had not taken the money "under color of hisoffice." "The object of the [extortion] statute is . . . not
the obtaining money by mere impropriety of conduct, orby fraud, by persons filling official position."

Id., at127. Rather, the court explained, "[a] taking under color

of office is of the essence of the offense. The moneyor thing received must have been claimed, or accepted, in
right of office, and the person paying must have been yielding to official authority." Id., at 128 (emphasis added).That a public official took money he was not due was

not enough. "[T]hough the defendant may have beenguilty of official infidelity, the wrong was to the State
only, and no wrong was done the person paying themoney. That wrong is not punishable under this indictment. Private and public wrong must concur, to constitute
robbery; for robbery is apparent, and hath the face of a crime, but extortion puts on the visure of virtue") (emphasis added).

extortion." Ibid. Numerous decisions from other juris-dictions confirm that an official obtained a payment "under

color of his office" only--as the phrase suggests--when heused the office to assert a false pretense of official right to
the payment.3Because the Court misapprehends the "color of office" requirement, the crime it describes today is not the common-law crime that Congress presumably incorporated into the
Hobbs Act. The explanation for this error is clear. The

Court's historical foray has the single-minded purpose ofproving that common-law extortion did

not include an element of "inducement"; in its haste to reach that conclusion,the Court fails to consider the elements that common-law

extortion did include. Even if the Court were correct that
an official could commit extortion at common law simply byreceiving (but not "inducing") an unlawful payment, it does

not follow either historically or logically that an official automatically committed extortion whenever he received such
a payment.The Court, therefore, errs in asserting that common-law

extortion is the "rough equivalent of what we would now
describe as `taking a bribe.' " Ante, at 260. Regardless of
whether extortion contains an "inducement" requirement,
bribery and extortion are different crimes. An official who
solicits or takes a bribe does not do so "under color of office";
i. e., under any pretense of official entitlement. "The distinction between bribery and extortion seems to be that the
former offense consists in offering a present or receiving one,
the latter in demanding a fee or present by color of office."
State v. Pritchard, 107 N. C. 921, 929, 12 S. E. 50, 52 (1890)
(emphasis added). Where extortion is at issue, the public
official is the sole wrongdoer; because he acts "under color of
office," the law regards the payor as an innocent victim and
not an accomplice. See, e. g., 1 W. Burdick, Law of Crime

$$ 273-275, pp. 392-396 (1946). With bribery, in contrast,
the payor knows the recipient official is not entitled to the
payment; he, as well as the official, may be punished for the
offense. See, e. g., id., $$ 288-292, at 426-436. Congress is
well aware of the distinction between the crimes; it has always treated them separately. Compare 18 U. S. C. $ 872
("[e]xtortion by officers or employees of the United States"
(emphasis added), which criminalizes extortion by federal officials, and makes no provision for punishment of the payor),
with 18 U. S. C. $ 201 ("[b]ribery of public officials and witnesses" (emphasis added), which criminalizes bribery of and

by federal officials). By stretching the bounds of extortion
to make it encompass bribery, the Court today blurs the traditional distinction between the crimes.4

4 The Court alleges a "complete absence of support" for the definition of
common-law extortion set forth in this dissent, and cites five American
cases that allegedly support its understanding of the crime. Ante, at 269-
271. The Court is mistaken on both counts: even a brief perusal of 19thand early 20th-century cases, as well as treatises and hornbooks, shows
that my description of the crime is anything but novel, and the cases cited
by the Court in no way support its argument.

The Court first cites two intermediate-court cases from Pennsylvania,
Commonwealth v. Wilson, 30 Pa. Super. 26 (1906), and Commonwealth v.
Brown, 23 Pa. Super. 470 (1903). Those opinions, both written by one
Judge Rice, display an obvious misunderstanding of the meaning of "color
of office." Citing the definition of that phrase set forth in the Cyclopedia
of Law and Practice, see n. 1, supra, the Court confuses a false pretense
of official authority to receive a payment with a false pretense of official
authority to do an official act. See Wilson, supra, at 31 ("Bribery on the
part of an officer and extortion are not identical, but they are very closely
allied; and whilst the former does not necessarily involve a pretense of
official authority to do the act for which the bribe is given, yet, if such
pretense is used to induce its payment, we see no reason to doubt that the
taking of it is common-law extortion as well as bribery") (emphasis added).
But, as Hawkins, Blackstone, and all other expositors of black-letter law
make clear, the crux of common-law extortion was the unlawful taking of
money by color of office, not the unlawful taking of money to do an act by
color of office.

In any event, the Pennsylvania court's unorthodox understanding of
common-law extortion in no way supports the Court's definition of the
crime, as the Pennsylvania court explicitly required a pretense of authority to induce the unlawful payment--precisely the requirement the Court
today rejects. See also Commonwealth v. Francis, 201 Pa. Super. 313,
322-323, 191 A. 2d 884, 889 (1963) (citing Wilson and Brown for the proposition that "the extraction of money or other things of value under a threat
of using the power of one's office may constitute extortion" and explaining
that "[a]lthough we have recognized that the crimes of common law extortion and bribery may coincide at times, . . . it is generally held that they
are mutually exclusive crimes") (emphasis added).

The third case cited by the Court, State v. Sweeney, 180 Minn. 450, 231
N. W. 225 (1930), does not involve extortion at all--it upheld a Minneapolis
alderman's conviction for bribery. At trial on one charge of receiving a

B
Perhaps because the common-law crime--as the Court de-fines it--is so expansive, the Court, at the very end of its

opinion, appends a qualification: "We hold today that the
bribe, the State introduced evidence that the defendant had received other
bribes, some from gambling houses. He challenged the admission of the
evidence of other crimes; the court rejected that challenge on evidentiary
grounds. In passing, however, the court said: "It may be noted, however,
that it may be that the defendant and [another alderman], in dealing with
the gambling houses, were guilty of extortion under [the state statute]."
Id., at 456, 231 N. W., at 228 (emphasis added). That is all. The Court's
parenthetical claim that "dicta" in the opinion support the proposition that
"alderman's acceptance of money for the erection of a barn, the running
of a gambling house, and the opening of a filling station would constitute
extortion" is, at best, a gross overstatement. Ante, at 270.

Fourth, the Court cites State v. Barts, 132 N. J. L. 74, 76, 83, 38 A. 2d
838, 841, 844 (1944), which upheld the extortion conviction of a police officer, based essentially on a bribery rationale. As the New Jersey Supreme
Court has neatly explained, however, that case represented a departure
from the traditional common law of extortion:

"Our extortion statute, which had its origin at least as early as 1796,
appears on its face to have been originally intended to be reiterative of
the common law. The essence of that offense was the receiving or taking
by any public officer, by color of his office, of any fee or reward not allowed
by law for performing his duties. The purpose would seem to be simply
to penalize the officer who non-innocently insisted upon a larger fee than
he was entitled to or a fee where none was permitted or required to be
paid for the performance of an obligatory function of his office. The
matter was obviously of particular importance in the days when public
officials received their compensation through fees collected and not by
fixed salary. Our early cases dealt with precisely this kind of a situation.
[Citing, inter alia, Cutter v. State and Loftus v. State, see n. 3, supra].

"After a couple of opinions possibly indicating an extension to cover
payments demanded for the favorable exercise of discretionary powers of
the officer, an enlarged construction of the statute to its present day scope
was announced in State v. Barts . . . . This present construction of the
crime thus overlaps the offense of bribery since extortion is committed
even where the object of the payment is in reality to influence an officer
in his official behavior or conduct without such having to be established."
State v. Begyn, 34 N. J. 35, 46-47, 167 A. 2d 161, 166-167 (1961) (emphasis
added; citations omitted). If the Court wishes to adopt the "modern"

286 EVANS v. UNITED STATES

Thomas, J., dissenting
Government need only show that a public official has obtained a payment to which he was not entitled, knowing that
the payment was made in return for official acts." Ante,
at 268 (emphasis added). This quid pro quo requirement is
simply made up. The Court does not suggest that it has any
basis in the common law or the language of the Hobbs Act,
and I have found no treatise or dictionary that refers to any
such requirement in defining "extortion."

Its only conceivable source, in fact, is our opinion last Term
in McCormick v. United States, 500 U. S. 257 (1991). Quite
sensibly, we insisted in that case that, unless the Government
established the existence of a quid pro quo, a public official
could not be convicted of extortion under the Hobbs Act for
accepting a campaign contribution. We did not purport to
discern that requirement in the common law or statutory
text, but imposed it to prevent the Hobbs Act from effecting
a radical (and absurd) change in American political life. "To

view of extortion, fine; but it should not attempt to present that view as
"common-law history."

Finally, the Court cites White v. State, 56 Ga. 385 (1876). There the
Georgia Supreme Court reversed the extortion conviction of a special constable who was charged with improperly keeping a fee that he had collected. The court first explained that a transaction was not extortion if
the defendant "took the money in good faith, without any claim to it."
Id., at 389 (emphasis added). The court then went on, in dicta, to assert
that if an officer "should use his authority, or any process of law in his
hands, for the purpose of awing or seducing any person into paying him
a bribe, that would, doubtless, be extortion." Ibid. (emphasis added).
For this latter proposition the Georgia court cited no authority. The
court's error is manifest: it confused the common-law meaning of extortion
(an officer wrongfully taking money under color of his office) with the
colloquial meaning of the term (which conjures up coercion, and thus is at
once broader and narrower than the common law). To the extent that
White's dicta cuts against my understanding of common-law extortion, of
course, it cuts equally strongly against the Court's, for, like the Pennsylvania cases cited earlier in this footnote, it quite obviously requires that the
extorted payment be "induced" by the officer--the very requirement the
Court today rejects.

hold otherwise would open to prosecution not only conduct
that has long been thought to be well within the law but also
conduct that in a very real sense is unavoidable so long as
election campaigns are financed by private contributions or
expenditures, as they have been from the beginning of the
Nation. It would require statutory language more explicit
than the Hobbs Act contains to justify a contrary conclusion." Id., at 272-273. We expressly limited our holding
to campaign contributions. Id., at 274, n. 10 ("[W]e do not
decide whether a quid pro quo requirement exists in other
contexts, such as when an elected official receives gifts,
meals, travel expenses, or other items of value").

Because the common-law history of extortion was neither
properly briefed nor argued in McCormick, see id., at 268,
n. 6; id., at 276-277 (Scalia, J., concurring), the quid pro quo
limitation imposed there represented a reasonable first step
in the right direction. Now that we squarely consider that
history, however, it is apparent that that limitation was in
fact overly modest: at common law, McCormick was innocent
of extortion not because he failed to offer a quid pro quo in
return for campaign contributions, but because he did not
take the contributions under color of official right. Today's
extension of McCormick's reasonable (but textually and historically artificial) quid pro quo limitation to all cases of official extortion is both unexplained and inexplicable--except
insofar as it may serve to rescue the Court's definition of
extortion from substantial overbreadth.

II
As serious as the Court's disregard for history is its disregard for well-established principles of statutory construction. The Court chooses not only the harshest interpretation of a criminal statute, but also the interpretation that
maximizes federal criminal jurisdiction over state and local
officials. I would reject both choices.

288 EVANS v. UNITED STATES

Thomas, J., dissenting

A
The Hobbs Act defines "extortion" as "the obtaining ofproperty from another, with his consent,

induced by wrong-ful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or

under color of official right." 18 U. S. C. $ 1951(b)(2) (em-phasis added).

5 Evans argues, in part, that he did not

"induce" any payment. The Court rejects that argument,concluding that the verb "induced" applies only to the first

portion of the definition. Ante, at 265. Thus, according tothe Court, the statute should read: " `The term "extortion"
means the obtaining of property from another, with his con-sent,

either [1] induced by wrongful use of actual or threat-ened force, violence, or fear, or [2] under color of official

right.' " Ante, at 265, n. 15. That is, I concede, a conceiv-able construction of the words. But it is--at the very
least--forced, for it sets up an unnatural and ungrammaticalparallel between the

verb "induced" and the preposition"under."

The more natural construction is that the verb "induced"applies to both types of extortion described in the statute.
Thus, the unstated "either" belongs after "induced": "Theterm `extortion' means the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced either [1] by wrongful useof actual or threatened force, violence, or fear,

"by"; the second with "under." 6

5 I have no quarrel with the Court's suggestion, see ante at 260, n. 4, that
there is no difference of substance between the classic common-law phrase
"by colour of his office" and the Hobbs Act's formulation "under color of
official right." The Act's formulation, of course, only underscores extortion's essential element of a false assertion of official right to a payment.

Our duty in construing this criminal statute, then, is clear:"The Court has often stated that when there are two rational

readings of a criminal statute, one harsher than the other,we are to choose the harsher only when Congress has spoken
in clear and definite language." McNally v. United States,483 U. S. 350, 359-360 (1987). See also

United States v.Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95 (1820) (Marshall, C. J.). Because

the Court's expansive interpretation of the statute is notthe only plausible one, the rule of lenity compels adoption of
the narrower interpretation. That rule, as we have ex-plained on many occasions, serves two vitally important
functions:

"First, `a fair warning should be given to the world inlanguage that the common world will understand, of

what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.To make the warning fair, so far as possible the line
should be clear.' Second, because of the seriousness ofcriminal penalties, and because criminal punishment
usually represents the moral condemnation of the com-munity, legislatures and not courts should define criminal activity." United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 348(1971) (citations omitted; footnote omitted).

Given the text of the statute and the rule of lenity, I believethat inducement is an element of official extortion under the
Hobbs Act.Perhaps sensing the weakness of its position, the Court
suggests an alternative interpretation: even if the statute
does set forth an "inducement" requirement for officialextortion, that requirement is always satisfied, because

"the coercive element is provided by the public office itself."
defines [official] extortion as `the obtaining of property from another under
color of official right,' or as `the obtaining of property from another, with
his consent, induced under color of official right.'. . . [T]he grammatical
structure of the Hobbs Act would appear to support the latter language")

Thomas, J., dissenting
Ante, at 266. I disagree. A particular public official, to besure, may wield his power in such a way as to coerce

unlawful payments, even in the absence of any explicitdemand or threat. But it ignores reality to assert that
every public official, in every context, automatically exertscoercive influence on others by virtue of his office. If the
chairman of General Motors meets with a local court clerk,for example, whatever implicit coercive pressures exist will
surely not emanate from the clerk. In Miranda v. Arizona,384 U. S. 436 (1966), of course, this Court established a
presumption of "inherently compelling pressures" in the con-text of official custodial interrogation.

Id., at 467. Now,apparently, we assume that
all public officials exude an auraof coercion at all places and at all times. That is not

progress. B

The Court's construction of the Hobbs Act is repugnantnot only to the basic tenets of criminal justice reflected in
the rule of lenity, but also to basic tenets of federalism.Over the past 20 years, the Hobbs Act has served as the
engine for a stunning expansion of federal criminal juris-diction into a field traditionally policed by state and local

laws--acts of public corruption by state and local officials.See generally Ruff, Federal Prosecution of Local Corruption: A Case Study in the Making of Law EnforcementPolicy, 65 Geo. L. J. 1171 (1977). That expansion was born
of a single sentence in a Third Circuit opinion: "[The`under color of official right' language in the Hobbs Act]
repeats the common law definition of extortion, a crimewhich could only be committed by a public official, and which
did not require proof of threat, fear, or duress." UnitedStates v. Kenny, 462 F. 2d 1205, 1229, cert. denied, 409 U. S.
914 (1972). As explained above, that sentence is not neces-sarily incorrect in its description of what common-law extortion did not require; unfortunately, it omits an importantpart of what common-law extortion did require. By over504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:09 PAGES OPINPGT

looking the traditional meaning of "under color of officialright,"

Kenny obliterated the distinction between extortion
and bribery, essentially creating a new crime encompassingboth.

"As effectively as if there were federal common lawcrimes, the court in

Kenny . . . amend[ed] the Hobbs Act
and [brought] into existence a new crime--local briberyaffecting interstate commerce. Hereafter, for purposes

of Hobbs Act prosecutions, such bribery was to be calledextortion. The federal policing of state corruption had
begun." J. Noonan, Bribes 586 (1984).
After Kenny, federal prosecutors came to view the Hobbs
Act as a license for ferreting out all wrongdoing at the stateand local level--" `a special code of integrity for public officials.' " United States v. O'Grady, 742 F. 2d 682, 694 (CA2
1984) (en banc) (quoting letter from Raymond J. Dearie,United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New

York, to the United States Court of Appeals for the SecondCircuit, dated Jan. 21, 1983). In short order, most other Circuits followed Kenny's lead and upheld, based on a briberyrationale, the Hobbs Act extortion convictions of an astonishing variety of state and local officials, from a State Governor,see

United States v. Hall, 536 F. 2d 313, 320-321 (CA10),
cert. denied, 429 U. S. 919 (1976), down to a local policeman,
see United States v. Braasch, 505 F. 2d 139, 151 (CA7 1974),cert. denied, 421 U. S. 910 (1975).

Our precedents, to be sure, suggest that Congress enjoysbroad constitutional power to legislate in areas traditionally
regulated by the States--power that apparently extends
even to the direct regulation of the qualifications, tenure, and
conduct of state governmental officials. See, e. g., Garcia v.
San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528,
547-554 (1985). As we emphasized only last Term, however,
concerns of federalism require us to give a narrow construction to federal legislation in such sensitive areas unless

Congress' contrary intent is "unmistakably clear in thelanguage of the statute."

Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S.
452, 460 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted). "Thisplain statement rule is nothing more than an acknowledgment that the States retain substantial sovereign
powers under our constitutional scheme, powers with whichCongress does not readily interfere."

Id., at 461. Gregory's teaching is straightforward: because we "assumeCongress does not exercise lightly" its extraordinary power

to regulate state officials, id., at 460, we will construeambiguous statutory provisions in the least intrusive manner that can reasonably be inferred from the statute, id.,at 467.

Gregory's rule represents nothing more than a restatement of established law:

"Congress has traditionally been reluctant to define asa federal crime conduct readily denounced as criminal

by the States. . . . As this Court emphasized only last
Term in Rewis v. United States, [401 U. S. 808 (1971)--a case involving the Hobbs Act's counterpart, the Travel

Act], we will not be quick to assume that Congress hasmeant to effect a significant change in the sensitive relation between federal and state criminal jurisdiction. Intraditionally sensitive areas, such as legislation affecting
the federal balance, the requirement of clear statementassures that the legislature has in fact faced, and intended to bring into issue, the critical matters involved
in the judicial decision." United States v. Bass, 404U. S., at 349 (footnote omitted).

Similarly, in McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350 (1987)--
a case closely analogous to this one--we rejected the Government's contention that the federal mail fraud statute, 18
U. S. C. $ 1341, protected the citizenry's "intangible right" to
good government, and hence could be applied to all instances
of state and local corruption. Such an expansive reading of

the statute, we noted with disapproval, would "leav[e] itsouter boundaries ambiguous and involv[e] the Federal Government in setting standards of disclosure and good govern-ment for local and state officials."

7 Cf. Baxter, Federal Dis7 Prior to our decision in McNally, the Government's theory had been
accepted by every Court of Appeals to consider the issue. We did not
consider that acceptance to cure the ambiguity we perceived in the
statutory language; we simply reiterated the traditional learning that a
federal criminal statute, particularly as applied to state officials, must
be construed narrowly. See 483 U. S., at 359-360. "If Congress desires
to go further," we said, "it must speak more clearly than it has." Id.,
at 360.

The dissent in McNally argued strenuously that the Court's interpretation of the statute should be informed by the majority view among the
Courts of Appeals and Congress' subsequent silence:

"Perhaps the most distressing aspect of the Court's action today is its
casual--almost summary--rejection of the accumulated wisdom of the
many distinguished federal judges who have thoughtfully considered and
correctly answered the question these cases present. . . . I [can]not join a
rejection of such a longstanding, consistent interpretation of a federal
statute. See Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Fink, 483 U. S. 89,
101 (1987) (Stevens, J., dissenting); Citicorp Industrial Credit, Inc. v.
Brock, 483 U. S. 27, 40 (1987) (Stevens, J., dissenting); Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 189 (1976) (Stevens, J., concurring)." Id., at 376-
377 (opinion of Stevens, J.).

The interpretation given a statute by a majority of the Courts of
Appeals, of course, is due our most respectful consideration. Ultimately, however, our attention must focus on the reasons given for
that interpretation. Error is not cured by repetition, and we do not discharge our duty simply by counting up the circuits on either side of the
split. Here, the minority position of the Second and Ninth Circuits
(both en banc) is far more thoughtfully reasoned than the position of
the majority of Circuits, which have followed the Third Circuit's lead in
United States v. Kenny, 462 F. 2d 1205 (1972), "without setting forth a
reasoned elaboration for their conclusions." United States v. Cerilli,
603 F. 2d 415, 427, and n. 5 (CA3 1979) (Aldisert, J., dissenting).
Moreover, I reject the notion--as this Court has on many occasions--
that Congress, through its silence, implicitly ratifies judicial decisions.
See, e. g., Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 175, n. 1
(1989) ("It is impossible to assert with any degree of assurance that

cretion in the Prosecution of Local Political Corruption, 10
Pepp. L. Rev. 321, 336-343 (1983).

The reader of today's opinion, however, will search in vain
for any consideration of the principles of federalism that animated Gregory, Rewis, Bass, and McNally. It is clear, of
course, that the Hobbs Act's proscription of extortion "under
color of official right" applies to all public officials, including
those at the state and local level. As our cases emphasize,
however, even when Congress has clearly decided to engage
in some regulation of the state governmental officials, concerns of federalism play a vital role in evaluating the scope
of the regulation.8 The Court today mocks this jurisprudence by reading two significant limitations (the textual requirement of "inducement" and the common-law requirement
of "under color of office") out of the Hobbs Act's definition of
official extortion.

proval" of judicial interpretation of a statute) (internal quotation marks
omitted).

I find it unfortunate that the arguments we rejected in McNally today
become the law of the land. See ante, at 268-269 ("Our conclusion is
buttressed by the fact that so many other courts that have considered the
issue over the last 20 years have interpreted the statute in the same way.
Moreover, given the number of appellate court decisions . . . it is obvious
that Congress is aware of the prevailing view" and has ratified that view
through its silence).

8 This case is, if anything, more compelling than Gregory v. Ashcroft,

501 U. S. 452 (1991). In both cases, Congress clearly chose to engage in
some regulation of state governmental officials. In Gregory, however,
that regulation was sweeping on its face, and our task was to construe an
exemption from that otherwise broad coverage. We decided the case on
the ground that the exemption must be assumed to include judges unless
a contrary intent were manifest. "[I]n this case we are not looking for a
plain statement that judges are excluded. We will not read the [statute]
to cover state judges unless Congress has made it clear that judges are
included. . . . [I]t must be plain to anyone reading the Act that it covers
judges." Id., at 467. Here, in contrast, our task is to construe the primary scope of the Hobbs Act.

I have no doubt that today's opinion is motivated by nobleaims. Political corruption at any level of government is a

serious evil, and, from a policy perspective, perhaps one wellsuited for federal law enforcement. But federal judges are
not free to devise new crimes to meet the occasion. ChiefJustice Marshall's warning is as timely today as ever: "It
would be dangerous, indeed, to carry the principle, that acase which is within the reason or mischief of a statute, is
within its provisions, so far as to punish a crime not enumer-ated in the statute, because it is of equal atrocity, or of kindred character, with those which are enumerated." UnitedStates v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat., at 96.

Whatever evils today's opinion may redress, in my view,pale beside those it will engender. "Courts must resist th[e]
temptation [to stretch criminal statutes] in the interest ofthe long-range preservation of limited and even-handed government." United States v. Mazzei, 521 F. 2d 639, 656 (CA31975) (en banc) (Gibbons, J., dissenting). All Americans, including public officials, are entitled to protection from prose-cutorial abuse. Cf.

Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654, 727-732 (1988) (
Scalia, J., dissenting). The facts of this casesuggest a depressing erosion of that protection.

Petitioner Evans was elected to the Board of Commission-ers of DeKalb County, Georgia, in 1982. He was no local
tyrant--just one of five part-time commissioners earning anannual salary of approximately $16,000. The board's activities were entirely local, including the quintessentially localactivity of zoning property. The United States does not
suggest that there were any allegations of corruption or mal-feasance against Evans.

In early 1985, as part of an investigation into "allegationsof public corruption in the Atlanta area," a Federal Bureau
of Investigation agent, Clifford Cormany, Jr., set up a bogusfirm, "WDH Developers," and pretended to be a land developer. Cormany sought and obtained a meeting with Evans.

504us1$76L 04-10-96 12:47:09 PAGES OPINPGT
296 EVANS v. UNITED STATES

Thomas, J., dissenting
From March 1985 until October 1987, a period of some two
and a half years, Cormany or one of his associates held 33
conversations with Evans. Every one of these contacts wasinitiated by the agents. During these conversations, the

agents repeatedly requested Evans' assistance in securing a
favorable zoning decision, and repeatedly brought up thesubject of campaign contributions. Agent Cormany eventually contributed $8,000 to Evans' reelection campaign, andEvans accepted the money. There is no suggestion that he
claimed an official entitlement to the payment. Nonetheless,he was arrested and charged with Hobbs Act extortion.

The Court is surely correct that there is sufficient evidence
to support the jury's verdict that Evans committed "extortion" under the Court's expansive interpretation of the
crime. But that interpretation has no basis in the statute
that Congress passed in 1946. If the Court makes up this
version of the crime today, who is to say what version it will
make up tomorrow when confronted with the next perceived
rascal? Until now, the Justice Department, with good reason, has been extremely cautious in advancing the theory
that official extortion contains no inducement requirement.
"Until the Supreme Court decides upon the validity of this
type of conviction, prosecutorial discretion should be used to
insure that any case which might reach that level of review is
worthy of federal prosecution. Such restraint would require that only significant amounts of money and reasonably
high levels of office should be involved." See U. S. Dept. of
Justice, United States Attorneys' Manual $ 9-131.180 (1984)
(emphasis added). Having detected no "[s]uch restraint" in
this case, I certainly have no reason to expect it in the future.

Our criminal justice system runs on the premise that
prosecutors will respect, and courts will enforce, the boundaries on criminal conduct set by the legislature. Where, as
here, those boundaries are breached, it becomes impossible
to tell where prosecutorial discretion ends and prosecutorial
abuse, or even discrimination, begins. The potential for

abuse, of course, is particularly grave in the inherently politi-cal context of public corruption prosecutions.

In my view, Evans is plainly innocent of extortion.9 Withall due respect, I am compelled to dissent.

9 Evans also was convicted of filing a false income tax return. He now
challenges that conviction on the ground that the jury was given improper
instructions. He did not, however, challenge those instructions at trial
or in the Court of Appeals. Thus, his current challenge is not properly
before this Court. See Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. August, 450 U. S. 346, 362

QUILL CORP. v. NORTH DAKOTA, by and through

its TAX COMMISSIONER, HEITKAMP

certiorari to the supreme court of north dakota

No. 91-194. Argued January 22, 1992--Decided May 26, 1992
Respondent North Dakota, through its Tax Commissioner, filed an action

in state court to require petitioner Quill Corporation--an out-of-state
mail-order house with neither outlets nor sales representatives in the
State--to collect and pay a use tax on goods purchased for use in the
State. The trial court ruled in Quill's favor. It found the case indistinguishable from National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of
Ill., 386 U. S. 753, which, in holding that a similar Illinois statute violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause and created an
unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, concluded that a "seller
whose only connection with customers in the State is by common carrier
or the . . . mail" lacked the requisite minimum contacts with the State.
Id., at 758. The State Supreme Court reversed, concluding, inter alia,
that, pursuant to Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274,
and its progeny, the Commerce Clause no longer mandated the sort of
physical-presence nexus suggested in Bellas Hess; and that, with respect to the Due Process Clause, cases following Bellas Hess had not
construed minimum contacts to require physical presence within a State
as a prerequisite to the legitimate exercise of state power.

Held:

1. The Due Process Clause does not bar enforcement of the State's
use tax against Quill. This Court's due process jurisprudence has
evolved substantially since Bellas Hess, abandoning formalistic tests focused on a defendant's presence within a State in favor of a more flexible
inquiry into whether a defendant's contacts with the forum made it reasonable, in the context of the federal system of Government, to require
it to defend the suit in that State. See Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S.
186, 212. Thus, to the extent that this Court's decisions have indicated
that the Clause requires a physical presence in a State, they are overruled. In this case, Quill has purposefully directed its activities at
North Dakota residents, the magnitude of those contacts are more than
sufficient for due process purposes, and the tax is related to the benefits
Quill receives from access to the State. Pp. 305-308.

2. The State's enforcement of the use tax against Quill places an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. Pp. 309-319.

(a) Bellas Hess was not rendered obsolete by this Court's subsequent decision in Complete Auto, supra, which set forth the four-part
test that continues to govern the validity of state taxes under the Commerce Clause. Although Complete Auto renounced an analytical approach that looked to a statute's formal language rather than its practical effect in determining a state tax statute's validity, the Bellas Hess
decision did not rely on such formalism. Nor is Bellas Hess inconsistent with Complete Auto. It concerns the first part of the Complete
Auto test and stands for the proposition that a vendor whose only contacts with the taxing State are by mail or common carrier lacks the
"substantial nexus" required by the Commerce Clause. Pp. 309-312.

(b) Contrary to the State's argument, a mail-order house may have
the "minimum contacts" with a taxing State as required by the Due
Process Clause and yet lack the "substantial nexus" with the State required by the Commerce Clause. These requirements are not identical
and are animated by different constitutional concerns and policies. Due
process concerns the fundamental fairness of governmental activity,
and the touchstone of due process nexus analysis is often identified as
"notice" or "fair warning." In contrast, the Commerce Clause and its
nexus requirement are informed by structural concerns about the effects of state regulation on the national economy. Pp. 312-313.

(c) The evolution of this Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence
does not indicate repudiation of the Bellas Hess rule. While cases subsequent to Bellas Hess and concerning other types of taxes have not
adopted a bright-line, physical-presence requirement similar to that in
Bellas Hess, see, e. g., Standard Pressed Steel Co. v. Department of Revenue of Wash., 419 U. S. 560, their reasoning does not compel rejection
of the Bellas Hess rule regarding sales and use taxes. To the contrary,
the continuing value of a bright-line rule in this area and the doctrine
and principles of stare decisis indicate that the rule remains good law.
Pp. 314-318.

(d) The underlying issue here is one that Congress may be better
qualified to resolve and one that it has the ultimate power to resolve.
Pp. 318-319.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case, like National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department
of Revenue of Ill., 386 U. S. 753 (1967), involves a State's
attempt to require an out-of-state mail-order house that has
neither outlets nor sales representatives in the State to collect and pay a use tax on goods purchased for use within the
State. In Bellas Hess we held that a similar Illinois statute
violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and created an unconstitutional burden on interstate
commerce. In particular, we ruled that a "seller whose only
connection with customers in the State is by common carrier
or the United States mail" lacked the requisite minimum contacts with the State. Id., at 758.

In this case, the Supreme Court of North Dakota declined
to follow Bellas Hess because "the tremendous social, economic, commercial, and legal innovations" of the past
quarter-century have rendered its holding "obsole[te]." 470

or overrule Bellas Hess. While we agree with much of thestate court's reasoning, we take the former course.

I
Quill is a Delaware corporation with offices and ware-houses in Illinois, California, and Georgia. None of its employees work or reside in North Dakota, and its ownershipof tangible property in that State is either insignificant or
nonexistent.1 Quill sells office equipment and supplies;it solicits business through catalogs and flyers, advertisements in national periodicals, and telephone calls. Its an-nual national sales exceed $200 million, of which almost $1
million are made to about 3,000 customers in North Dakota.It is the sixth largest vendor of office supplies in the State.
It delivers all of its merchandise to its North Dakota custom-ers by mail or common carrier from out-of-state locations.

As a corollary to its sales tax, North Dakota imposes a usetax upon property purchased for storage, use, or consumption within the State. North Dakota requires every "re-tailer maintaining a place of business in" the State to collect
the tax from the consumer and remit it to the State. N. D.Cent. Code $ 57-40.2-07 (Supp. 1991). In 1987, North Dakota amended the statutory definition of the term "retailer"to include "every person who engages in regular or system1 In the trial court, the State argued that because Quill gave its customers an unconditional 90-day guarantee, it retained title to the merchandise
during the 90-day period after delivery. The trial court held, however,
that title passed to the purchaser when the merchandise was received.
See App. to Pet. for Cert. A40-A41. The State Supreme Court assumed
for the purposes of its decision that that ruling was correct. 470 N. W. 2d
203, 217, n. 13 (1991). The State Supreme Court also noted that Quill
licensed a computer software program to some of its North Dakota customers that enabled them to check Quill's current inventories and prices
and to place orders directly. Id., at 216-217. As we shall explain, Quill's
interests in the licensed software does not affect our analysis of the due
process issue and does not comprise the "substantial nexus" required by
the Commerce Clause. See n. 8, infra.

Opinion of the Court
atic solicitation of a consumer market in th[e] state." $ 57-40.2-01(6). State regulations in turn define "regular or systematic solicitation" to mean three or more advertisementswithin a 12-month period. N. D. Admin. Code $ 81-04.1-01-
03.1 (1988). Thus, since 1987, mail-order companies that engage in such solicitation have been subject to the tax even ifthey maintain no property or personnel in North Dakota.

Quill has taken the position that North Dakota does nothave the power to compel it to collect a use tax from its
North Dakota customers. Consequently, the State, throughits Tax Commissioner, filed this action to require Quill to pay
taxes (as well as interest and penalties) on all such sales
made after July 1, 1987. The trial court ruled in Quill's
favor, finding the case indistinguishable from Bellas Hess;
specifically, it found that because the State had not shown
that it had spent tax revenues for the benefit of the mailorder business, there was no "nexus to allow the state to
define retailer in the manner it chose." App. to Pet. for
Cert. A41.

The North Dakota Supreme Court reversed, concluding
that "wholesale changes" in both the economy and the law
made it inappropriate to follow Bellas Hess today. 470
N. W. 2d, at 213. The principal economic change noted by
the court was the remarkable growth of the mail-order business "from a relatively inconsequential market niche" in 1967
to a "goliath" with annual sales that reached "the staggering
figure of $183.3 billion in 1989." Id., at 208, 209. Moreover,
the court observed, advances in computer technology greatly
eased the burden of compliance with a " `welter of complicated obligations' " imposed by state and local taxing authorities. Id., at 215 (quoting Bellas Hess, 386 U. S., at 759-760).

Equally important, in the court's view, were the changes
in the "legal landscape." With respect to the Commerce
Clause, the court emphasized that Complete Auto Transit,
Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274 (1977), rejected the line of cases
holding that the direct taxation of interstate commerce was

504us1$77K 04-23-96 09:39:53 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
impermissible and adopted instead a "consistent and rational
method of inquiry [that focused on] the practical effect of
[the] challenged tax." Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of
Taxes of Vt., 445 U. S. 425, 443 (1980). This and subsequent
rulings, the court maintained, indicated that the Commerce
Clause no longer mandated the sort of physical-presence
nexus suggested in Bellas Hess.

Similarly, with respect to the Due Process Clause, the
North Dakota court observed that cases following Bellas
Hess had not construed "minimum contacts" to require physical presence within a State as a prerequisite to the legitimate exercise of state power. The state court then concluded that "the Due Process requirement of a `minimal
connection' to establish nexus is encompassed within the
Complete Auto test" and that the relevant inquiry under the
latter test was whether "the state has provided some protection, opportunities, or benefit for which it can expect a return." 470 N. W. 2d, at 216.

Turning to the case at hand, the state court emphasized
that North Dakota had created "an economic climate that
fosters demand for" Quill's products, maintained a legal infrastructure that protected that market, and disposed of 24
tons of catalogs and flyers mailed by Quill into the State
every year. Id., at 218-219. Based on these facts, the
court concluded that Quill's "economic presence" in North
Dakota depended on services and benefits provided by the
State and therefore generated "a constitutionally sufficient
nexus to justify imposition of the purely administrative duty
of collecting and remitting the use tax." Id., at 219.2

2 The court also suggested that, in view of the fact that the "touchstone
of Due Process is fundamental fairness" and that the "very object" of the
Commerce Clause is protection of interstate business against discriminatory local practices, it would be ironic to exempt Quill from this burden
and thereby allow it to enjoy a significant competitive advantage over
local retailers. 470 N. W. 2d, at 214-215.

Opinion of the Court

II
As in a number of other cases involving the application of
state taxing statutes to out-of-state sellers, our holding in
Bellas Hess relied on both the Due Process Clause and the
Commerce Clause. Although the "two claims are closely related," Bellas Hess, 386 U. S., at 756, the Clauses pose distinct limits on the taxing powers of the States. Accordingly,
while a State may, consistent with the Due Process Clause,
have the authority to tax a particular taxpayer, imposition
of the tax may nonetheless violate the Commerce Clause.
See, e. g., Tyler Pipe Industries, Inc. v. Washington State
Dept. of Revenue, 483 U. S. 232 (1987).

The two constitutional requirements differ fundamentally,
in several ways. As discussed at greater length below, see
Part IV, infra, the Due Process Clause and the Commerce
Clause reflect different constitutional concerns. Moreover,
while Congress has plenary power to regulate commerce
among the States and thus may authorize state actions that
burden interstate commerce, see International Shoe Co. v.
Washington, 326 U. S. 310, 315 (1945), it does not similarly
have the power to authorize violations of the Due Process
Clause.

Thus, although we have not always been precise in distinguishing between the two, the Due Process Clause and the
Commerce Clause are analytically distinct.

" `Due process' and `commerce clause' conceptions are
not always sharply separable in dealing with these
problems. . . . To some extent they overlap. If there is
a want of due process to sustain the tax, by that fact
alone any burden the tax imposes on the commerce
among the states becomes `undue.' But, though overlapping, the two conceptions are not identical. There
may be more than sufficient factual connections, with
economic and legal effects, between the transaction and
the taxing state to sustain the tax as against due process

Opinion of the Court
objections. Yet it may fall because of its burdening ef-fect upon the commerce. And, although the two notions

cannot always be separated, clarity of consideration andof decision would be promoted if the two issues are approached, where they are presented, at least tentativelyas if they were separate and distinct, not intermingled
ones." International Harvester Co. v. Department of
Treasury, 322 U. S. 340, 353 (1944) (Rutledge, J., concur-ring in part and dissenting in part).

Heeding Justice Rutledge's counsel, we consider each consti-tutional limit in turn.

III
The Due Process Clause "requires some definite link, someminimum connection, between a state and the person, property or transaction it seeks to tax," Miller Brothers Co. v.
Maryland, 347 U. S. 340, 344-345 (1954), and that the "in-come attributed to the State for tax purposes must be rationally related to `values connected with the taxing State,' "
Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U. S. 267, 273 (1978) (citationomitted). Here, we are concerned primarily with the first

of these requirements. Prior to Bellas Hess, we had heldthat that requirement was satisfied in a variety of circumstances involving use taxes. For example, the presence ofsales personnel in the State

3 or the maintenance of local retail stores in the State 4 justified the exercise of that powerbecause the seller's local activities were "plainly accorded

the protection and services of the taxing State." BellasHess, 386 U. S., at 757. The furthest extension of that power
was recognized in Scripto, Inc. v. Carson, 362 U. S. 207(1960), in which the Court upheld a use tax despite the fact
that all of the seller's in-state solicitation was performed byindependent contractors. These cases all involved some
sort of physical presence within the State, and in Bellas Hess

3 Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher, 306 U. S. 62 (1939).
4 Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 312 U. S. 359 (1941).

Opinion of the Court
the Court suggested that such presence was not only suffi-cient for jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause, but also

necessary. We expressly declined to obliterate the "sharpdistinction . . . between mail-order sellers with retail outlets,
solicitors, or property within a State, and those who do nomore than communicate with customers in the State by mail
or common carrier as a part of a general interstate business."386 U. S., at 758.

Our due process jurisprudence has evolved substantiallyin the 25 years since

Bellas Hess, particularly in the area ofjudicial jurisdiction. Building on the seminal case of International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310 (1945), wehave framed the relevant inquiry as whether a defendant had
minimum contacts with the jurisdiction "such that the main-tenance of the suit does not offend `traditional notions of fair
play and substantial justice.' " Id., at 316 (quoting Millikenv.

Meyer, 311 U. S. 457, 463 (1940)). In that spirit, we haveabandoned more formalistic tests that focused on a defendant's "presence" within a State in favor of a more flexibleinquiry into whether a defendant's contacts with the forum
made it reasonable, in the context of our federal system ofGovernment, to require it to defend the suit in that State.
In Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S. 186, 212 (1977), the Courtextended the flexible approach that

International Shoe hadprescribed for purposes of in personam jurisdiction to in

rem jurisdiction, concluding that "all assertions of state-court jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the standards set forth in International Shoe and its progeny."Applying these principles, we have held that if a foreign
corporation purposefully avails itself of the benefits of aneconomic market in the forum State, it may subject itself to
the State's in personam jurisdiction even if it has no physicalpresence in the State. As we explained in

Burger King
Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462 (1985):

"Jurisdiction in these circumstances may not beavoided merely because the defendant did not physi504us1$77K 04-23-96 09:39:53 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
cally enter the forum State. Although territorial pres-ence frequently will enhance a potential defendant's

affiliation with a State and reinforce the reasonableforeseeability of suit there, it is an inescapable fact of
modern commercial life that a substantial amount ofbusiness is transacted solely by mail and wire communications across state lines, thus obviating the need forphysical presence within a State in which business is
conducted. So long as a commercial actor's efforts are`purposefully directed' toward residents of another
State, we have consistently rejected the notion thatan absence of physical contacts can defeat personal jurisdiction there." Id., at 476 (emphasis in original).
Comparable reasoning justifies the imposition of the collec-tion duty on a mail-order house that is engaged in continuous

and widespread solicitation of business within a State. Sucha corporation clearly has "fair warning that [its] activity may
subject [it] to the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign." Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S., at 218 (Stevens, J., concurring injudgment). In "modern commercial life" it matters little

that such solicitation is accomplished by a deluge of catalogsrather than a phalanx of drummers: The requirements of due
process are met irrespective of a corporation's lack of physi-cal presence in the taxing State. Thus, to the extent that
our decisions have indicated that the Due Process Clauserequires physical presence in a State for the imposition of
duty to collect a use tax, we overrule those holdings as su-perseded by developments in the law of due process.

In this case, there is no question that Quill has purpose-fully directed its activities at North Dakota residents, that
the magnitude of those contacts is more than sufficient fordue process purposes, and that the use tax is related to the
benefits Quill receives from access to the State. We there-fore agree with the North Dakota Supreme Court's conclusion that the Due Process Clause does not bar enforcementof that State's use tax against Quill.

Opinion of the Court

IV
Article I, $ 8, cl. 3, of the Constitution expressly authorizesCongress to "regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and

among the several States." It says nothing about the pro-tection of interstate commerce in the absence of any action
by Congress. Nevertheless, as Justice Johnson suggestedin his concurring opinion in

Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1,231-232, 239 (1824), the Commerce Clause is more than an

affirmative grant of power; it has a negative sweep as well.The Clause, in Justice Stone's phrasing, "by its own force"
prohibits certain state actions that interfere with interstatecommerce.

South Carolina State Highway Dept. v. Barn-well Brothers, Inc., 303 U. S. 177, 185 (1938).

Our interpretation of the "negative" or "dormant" Com-merce Clause has evolved substantially over the years,
particularly as that Clause concerns limitations on state tax-ation powers. See generally P. Hartman, Federal Limitations on State and Local Taxation $$ 2:9-2:17 (1981). Ourearly cases, beginning with

Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat.419 (1827), swept broadly, and in Leloup v. Port of Mobile,

127 U. S. 640, 648 (1888), we declared that "no State has theright to lay a tax on interstate commerce in any form." We
later narrowed that rule and distinguished between directburdens on interstate commerce, which were prohibited, and
indirect burdens, which generally were not. See, e. g., Sanford v. Poe, 69 F. 546 (CA6 1895), aff 'd sub nom. AdamsExpress Co. v. Ohio State Auditor, 165 U. S. 194, 220 (1897).

Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250, 256-258 (1938), and subsequent decisions rejected this formal,
categorical analysis and adopted a "multiple-taxation doc-trine" that focused not on whether a tax was "direct" or "indirect" but rather on whether a tax subjected interstatecommerce to a risk of multiple taxation. However, in

Free-man v. Hewit, 329 U. S. 249, 256 (1946), we embraced again

the formal distinction between direct and indirect taxation,invalidating Indiana's imposition of a gross receipts tax on a

Opinion of the Court
particular transaction because that application would "impos[e] a direct tax on interstate sales." Most recently, in
Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S., at 285, we
renounced the Freeman approach as "attaching constitutional significance to a semantic difference." We expressly
overruled one of Freeman's progeny, Spector Motor Service,
Inc. v. O'Connor, 340 U. S. 602 (1951), which held that a tax
on "the privilege of doing interstate business" was unconstitutional, while recognizing that a differently denominated
tax with the same economic effect would not be unconstitutional. Spector, as we observed in Railway Express
Agency, Inc. v. Virginia, 358 U. S. 434, 441 (1959), created a
situation in which "magic words or labels" could "disable an
otherwise constitutional levy." Complete Auto emphasized
the importance of looking past "the formal language of the
tax statute [to] its practical effect," 430 U. S., at 279, and set
forth a four-part test that continues to govern the validity
of state taxes under the Commerce Clause.5

Bellas Hess was decided in 1967, in the middle of this latest rally between formalism and pragmatism. Contrary to
the suggestion of the North Dakota Supreme Court, this timing does not mean that Complete Auto rendered Bellas Hess
"obsolete." Complete Auto rejected Freeman and Spector's
formal distinction between "direct" and "indirect" taxes on
interstate commerce because that formalism allowed the validity of statutes to hinge on "legal terminology," "draftsmanship and phraseology." 430 U. S., at 281. Bellas Hess

5 Under our current Commerce Clause jurisprudence, "with certain restrictions, interstate commerce may be required to pay its fair share of
state taxes." D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 31 (1988); see
also Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 623-624 (1981)
("It was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged
in interstate commerce from their just share of [the] state tax burden even
though it increases the cost of doing business") (internal quotation marks
and citation omitted).

Opinion of the Court
did not rely on any such labeling of taxes and therefore didnot automatically fall with

Freeman and its progeny.
While contemporary Commerce Clause jurisprudencemight not dictate the same result were the issue to arise

for the first time today, Bellas Hess is not inconsistent
with Complete Auto and our recent cases. Under Complete
Auto's four-part test, we will sustain a tax against a Commerce Clause challenge so long as the "tax [1] is applied toan activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State,

[2] is fairly apportioned, [3] does not discriminate againstinterstate commerce, and [4] is fairly related to the services
provided by the State." 430 U. S., at 279. Bellas Hess concerns the first of these tests and stands for the proposition
that a vendor whose only contacts with the taxing State are
by mail or common carrier lacks the "substantial nexus" required by the Commerce Clause.

Thus, three weeks after Complete Auto was handed down,
we cited Bellas Hess for this proposition and discussed the

case at some length. In National Geographic Society v.
California Bd. of Equalization, 430 U. S. 551, 559 (1977),
we affirmed the continuing vitality of Bellas Hess' "sharp
distinction . . . between mail-order sellers with [a physical
presence in the taxing] State and those . . . who do no more
than communicate with customers in the State by mail or
common carrier as part of a general interstate business."
We have continued to cite Bellas Hess with approval ever
since. For example, in Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U. S. 252, 263

(1989), we expressed "doubt that termination of an interstate
telephone call, by itself, provides a substantial enough nexus
for a State to tax a call. See National Bellas Hess . . .
(receipt of mail provides insufficient nexus)." See also D. H.
Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 33 (1988); Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 626 (1981);
Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, 445 U. S., at 437;
National Geographic Society, 430 U. S., at 559. For these
reasons, we disagree with the State Supreme Court's conclu504us1$77K 04-23-96 09:39:53 PAGES OPINPGT
312 QUILL CORP. v. NORTH DAKOTA

Opinion of the Court
sion that our decision in Complete Auto undercut the Bellas
Hess rule.

The State of North Dakota relies less on Complete Autoand more on the evolution of our due process jurisprudence.

The State contends that the nexus requirements imposed by
the Due Process and Commerce Clauses are equivalent andthat if, as we concluded above, a mail-order house that lacks

a physical presence in the taxing State nonetheless satisfiesthe due process "minimum contacts" test, then that corporation also meets the Commerce Clause "substantial nexus"test. We disagree. Despite the similarity in phrasing, the
nexus requirements of the Due Process and Commerce
Clauses are not identical. The two standards are animated
by different constitutional concerns and policies.

Due process centrally concerns the fundamental fairness
of governmental activity. Thus, at the most general level,
the due process nexus analysis requires that we ask whether
an individual's connections with a State are substantial
enough to legitimate the State's exercise of power over him.
We have, therefore, often identified "notice" or "fair warning" as the analytic touchstone of due process nexus analysis.
In contrast, the Commerce Clause and its nexus requirement
are informed not so much by concerns about fairness for the
individual defendant as by structural concerns about the effects of state regulation on the national economy. Under
the Articles of Confederation, state taxes and duties hindered and suppressed interstate commerce; the Framers intended the Commerce Clause as a cure for these structural
ills. See generally The Federalist Nos. 7, 11 (A. Hamilton).
It is in this light that we have interpreted the negative implication of the Commerce Clause. Accordingly, we have ruled
that that Clause prohibits discrimination against interstate
commerce, see, e. g., Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S.
617 (1978), and bars state regulations that unduly burden
interstate commerce, see, e. g., Kassel v. Consolidated
Freightways Corp. of Del., 450 U. S. 662 (1981).

313Cite as: 504 U. S. 298 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
The Complete Auto analysis reflects these concerns aboutthe national economy. The second and third parts of that

analysis, which require fair apportionment and non-discrimination, prohibit taxes that pass an unfair share of the
tax burden onto interstate commerce. The first and fourthprongs, which require a substantial nexus and a relationship
between the tax and state-provided services, limit the reachof state taxing authority so as to ensure that state taxation
does not unduly burden interstate commerce.6 Thus, the"substantial nexus" requirement is not, like due process'
"minimum contacts" requirement, a proxy for notice, butrather a means for limiting state burdens on interstate
commerce. Accordingly, contrary to the State's suggestion, acorporation may have the "minimum contacts" with a taxing
State as required by the Due Process Clause, and yet lackthe "substantial nexus" with that State as required by the
Commerce Clause.7

6 North Dakota's use tax illustrates well how a state tax might unduly
burden interstate commerce. On its face, North Dakota law imposes a
collection duty on every vendor who advertises in the State three times
in a single year. Thus, absent the Bellas Hess rule, a publisher who included a subscription card in three issues of its magazine, a vendor whose
radio advertisements were heard in North Dakota on three occasions, and
a corporation whose telephone sales force made three calls into the State,
all would be subject to the collection duty. What is more significant, similar obligations might be imposed by the Nation's 6,000-plus taxing jurisdictions. See National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of Ill.,
386 U. S. 753, 759-760 (1967) (noting that the "many variations in rates of
tax, in allowable exemptions, and in administrative and record-keeping
requirements could entangle [a mail-order house] in a virtual welter of
complicated obligations") (footnotes omitted); see also Shaviro, An Economic and Political Look at Federalism in Taxation, 90 Mich. L. Rev. 895,
925-926 (1992).

7 We have sometimes stated that the "Complete Auto test, while responsive to Commerce Clause dictates, encompasses as well . . . due process
requirement[s]." Trinova Corp. v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 498 U. S.
358, 373 (1991). Although such comments might suggest that every tax
that passes contemporary Commerce Clause analysis is also valid under
the Due Process Clause, it does not follow that the converse is as well

314 QUILL CORP. v. NORTH DAKOTA

Opinion of the Court
The State Supreme Court reviewed our recent CommerceClause decisions and concluded that those rulings signaled

a "retreat from the formalistic constrictions of a stringentphysical presence test in favor of a more flexible substantive
approach" and thus supported its decision not to apply Bellas
Hess. 470 N. W. 2d, at 214 (citing Standard Pressed SteelCo. v. Department of Revenue of Wash., 419 U. S. 560 (1975),

and Tyler Pipe Industries, Inc. v. Washington State Dept.of Revenue, 483 U. S. 232 (1987)). Although we agree with
the state court's assessment of the evolution of our cases, wedo not share its conclusion that this evolution indicates that
the Commerce Clause ruling of Bellas Hess is no longergood law.

First, as the state court itself noted, 470 N. W. 2d, at 214,all of these cases involved taxpayers who had a physical
presence in the taxing State and therefore do not directlyconflict with the rule of

Bellas Hess or compel that it beoverruled. Second, and more importantly, although our

Commerce Clause jurisprudence now favors more flexiblebalancing analyses, we have never intimated a desire to reject all established "bright-line" tests. Although we havenot, in our review of other types of taxes, articulated the
same physical-presence requirement that Bellas Hess estab-lished for sales and use taxes, that silence does not imply
repudiation of the Bellas Hess rule.

Complete Auto, it is true, renounced Freeman and itsprogeny as "formalistic." But not all formalism is alike.

Spector's formal distinction between taxes on the "privilegeof doing business" and all other taxes served no purpose
within our Commerce Clause jurisprudence, but stood "onlyas a trap for the unwary draftsman."

Complete Auto, 430U. S., at 279. In contrast, the bright-line rule of Bellas Hess

furthers the ends of the dormant Commerce Clause. Undue

true: A tax may be consistent with due process and yet unduly burden
interstate commerce. See, e. g., Tyler Pipe Industries, Inc. v. Washington State Dept. of Revenue, 483 U. S. 232 (1987).

Opinion of the Court
burdens on interstate commerce may be avoided not only bya case-by-case evaluation of the actual burdens imposed by

particular regulations or taxes, but also, in some situations,by the demarcation of a discrete realm of commercial activity
that is free from interstate taxation. Bellas Hess followedthe latter approach and created a safe harbor for vendors
"whose only connection with customers in the [taxing] Stateis by common carrier or the United States mail." Under
Bellas Hess, such vendors are free from state-imposed dutiesto collect sales and use taxes.

8

Like other bright-line tests, the Bellas Hess rule appearsartificial at its edges: Whether or not a State may compel a

vendor to collect a sales or use tax may turn on the presencein the taxing State of a small sales force, plant, or office. Cf.
National Geographic Society v. California Bd. of Equalization, 430 U. S. 551 (1977); Scripto, Inc. v. Carson, 362 U. S.207 (1960). This artificiality, however, is more than offset

by the benefits of a clear rule. Such a rule firmly estab-lishes the boundaries of legitimate state authority to impose
a duty to collect sales and use taxes and reduces litigationconcerning those taxes. This benefit is important, for as we
have so frequently noted, our law in this area is somethingof a "quagmire" and the "application of constitutional principles to specific state statutes leaves much room for contro-versy and confusion and little in the way of precise guides to
the States in the exercise of their indispensable power of

diskettes to which Quill holds title seems a slender thread upon which to
base nexus." Brief for Respondent 46. We agree. Although title to "a
few floppy diskettes" present in a State might constitute some minimal
nexus, in National Geographic Society v. California Bd. of Equalization,
430 U. S. 551, 556 (1977), we expressly rejected a " `slightest presence'
standard of constitutional nexus." We therefore conclude that Quill's licensing of software in this case does not meet the "substantial nexus"
requirement of the Commerce Clause.

taxation." Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v.Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450, 457-458 (1959).

Moreover, a bright-line rule in the area of sales and usetaxes also encourages settled expectations and, in doing so,
fosters investment by businesses and individuals.9 Indeed,it is not unlikely that the mail-order industry's dramatic
growth over the last quarter century is due in part to thebright-line exemption from state taxation created in

BellasHess.

Notwithstanding the benefits of bright-line tests, we have,in some situations, decided to replace such tests with more
contextual balancing inquiries. For example, in ArkansasElectric Cooperative Corp. v. Arkansas Pub. Serv. Comm'n,
461 U. S. 375 (1983), we reconsidered a bright-line test setforth in

Public Util. Comm'n of R. I. v. Attleboro Steam &Electric Co., 273 U. S. 83 (1927). Attleboro distinguished between state regulation of wholesale sales of electricity, whichwas constitutional as an "indirect" regulation of interstate
commerce, and state regulation of retail sales of electricity,which was unconstitutional as a "direct regulation" of commerce. In Arkansas Electric, we considered whether to

9 It is worth noting that Congress has, at least on one occasion, followed
a similar approach in its regulation of state taxation. In response to this
Court's indication in Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450, 452 (1959), that, so long as the taxpayer has an
adequate nexus with the taxing State, "net income from the interstate
operations of a foreign corporation may be subjected to state taxation,"
Congress enacted Pub. L. 86-272, codified at 15 U. S. C. $ 381. That statute provides that a State may not impose a net income tax on any person
if that person's "only business activities within such State [involve] the
solicitation of orders [approved] outside the State [and] filled . . . outside
the State." Ibid. As we noted in Heublein, Inc. v. South Carolina Tax
Comm'n, 409 U. S. 275, 280 (1972), in enacting $ 381, "Congress attempted
to allay the apprehension of businessmen that `mere solicitation' would
subject them to state taxation. . . . Section 381 was designed to define
clearly a lower limit for the exercise of [the State's power to tax]. Clarity
that would remove uncertainty was Congress' primary goal." (Emphasis supplied.)

Opinion of the Court
"follow the mechanical test set out in Attleboro, or thebalance-of-interests test applied in our Commerce Clause

cases." 461 U. S., at 390-391. We first observed that "theprinciple of

stare decisis counsels us, here as elsewhere, not
lightly to set aside specific guidance of the sort we find in
Attleboro." Id., at 391. In deciding to reject the Attleboroanalysis, we were influenced by the fact that the "mechanical

test" was "anachronistic," that the Court had rarely reliedon the test, and that we could "see no strong reliance interests" that would be upset by the rejection of that test. 461U. S., at 391-392. None of those factors obtains in this case.
First, the Attleboro rule was "anachronistic" because it relied on formal distinctions between "direct" and "indirect"
regulation (and on the regulatory counterparts of our Freeman line of cases); as discussed above, Bellas Hess turned
on a different logic and thus remained sound after the Court
repudiated an analogous distinction in Complete Auto. Second, unlike the Attleboro rule, we have, in our decisions, frequently relied on the Bellas Hess rule in the last 25 years,
see supra, at 311, and we have never intimated in our review
of sales or use taxes that Bellas Hess was unsound. Finally,
again unlike the Attleboro rule, the Bellas Hess rule has engendered substantial reliance and has become part of the
basic framework of a sizable industry. The "interest in stability and orderly development of the law" that undergirds
the doctrine of stare decisis, see Runyon v. McCrary, 427
U. S. 160, 190-191 (1976) (Stevens, J., concurring), therefore
counsels adherence to settled precedent.

In sum, although in our cases subsequent to Bellas Hess
and concerning other types of taxes we have not adopted a
similar bright-line, physical-presence requirement, our reasoning in those cases does not compel that we now reject the
rule that Bellas Hess established in the area of sales and use
taxes. To the contrary, the continuing value of a bright-line
rule in this area and the doctrine and principles of stare decisis indicate that the Bellas Hess rule remains good law. For

these reasons, we disagree with the North Dakota SupremeCourt's conclusion that the time has come to renounce the

bright-line test of Bellas Hess.This aspect of our decision is made easier by the fact that
the underlying issue is not only one that Congress may bebetter qualified to resolve,

10 but also one that Congress has

the ultimate power to resolve. No matter how we evaluatethe burdens that use taxes impose on interstate commerce,

Congress remains free to disagree with our conclusions.See

Prudential Insurance Co. v. Benjamin, 328 U. S. 408(1946). Indeed, in recent years Congress has considered

legislation that would "overrule" the Bellas Hess rule.11 Itsdecision not to take action in this direction may, of course,
have been dictated by respect for our holding in Bellas Hessthat the Due Process Clause prohibits States from imposing
such taxes, but today we have put that problem to rest. Ac-cordingly, Congress is now free to decide whether, when, and
to what extent the States may burden interstate mail-orderconcerns with a duty to collect use taxes.

Indeed, even if we were convinced that Bellas Hess wasinconsistent with our Commerce Clause jurisprudence, "this
very fact [might] giv[e us] pause and counse[l] withholdingour hand, at least for now. Congress has the power to protect interstate commerce from intolerable or even unde-sirable burdens." Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana,
453 U. S., at 637 (White, J., concurring). In this situation, it

10 Many States have enacted use taxes. See App. 3 to Brief for Direct
Marketing Association as Amicus Curiae. An overruling of Bellas Hess
might raise thorny questions concerning the retroactive application of
those taxes and might trigger substantial unanticipated liability for mailorder houses. The precise allocation of such burdens is better resolved
by Congress rather than this Court.

may be that "the better part of both wisdom and valor is torespect the judgment of the other branches of the Government." Id., at 638.The judgment of the Supreme Court of North Dakota is
reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Kennedy and
Justice Thomas join, concurring in part and concurringin the judgment.

National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of
Ill., 386 U. S. 753 (1967), held that the Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the Constitution prohibit a State from im-posing the duty of use-tax collection and payment upon a

seller whose only connection with the State is through common carrier or the United States mail. I agree with the
Court that the Due Process Clause holding of Bellas Hess
should be overruled. Even before Bellas Hess, we had held,
correctly I think, that state regulatory jurisdiction could be
asserted on the basis of contacts with the State through the
United States mail. See Travelers Health Assn. v. Virginia
ex rel. State Corp. Comm'n, 339 U. S. 643, 646-650 (1950)
(blue sky laws). It is difficult to discern any principled basis
for distinguishing between jurisdiction to regulate and jurisdiction to tax. As an original matter, it might have been
possible to distinguish between jurisdiction to tax and jurisdiction to compel collection of taxes as agent for the State,
but we have rejected that. National Geographic Society v.
California Bd. of Equalization, 430 U. S. 551, 558 (1977);
Scripto, Inc. v. Carson, 362 U. S. 207, 211 (1960). I agree
with the Court, moreover, that abandonment of Bellas Hess'
due process holding is compelled by reasoning "[c]omparable" to that contained in our post-1967 cases dealing with
state jurisdiction to adjudicate. Ante, at 308. I do not understand this to mean that the due process standards for

regulation of interstate commerce, and it can change the rule
of Bellas Hess by simply saying so. We have long recognized that the doctrine of stare decisis has "special force"
where "Congress remains free to alter what we have done."

the doctrine are "at their acme . . . where reliance interests
are involved." Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991).
As the Court notes, "the Bellas Hess rule has engendered
substantial reliance and has become part of the basic framework of a sizable industry." Ante, at 317.

I do not share Justice White's view that we may disregard these reliance interests because it has become unreasonable to rely upon Bellas Hess. Post, at 331-332. Even
assuming for the sake of argument (I do not consider the
point) that later decisions in related areas are inconsistent
with the principles upon which Bellas Hess rested, we have
never acknowledged that, but have instead carefully distinguished the case on its facts. See, e. g., D. H. Holmes Co.
v. McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 33 (1988); National Geographic
Society, supra, at 559. It seems to me important that we
retain our ability--and, what comes to the same thing, that

we maintain public confidence in our ability--sometimes toadopt new principles for the resolution of new issues without

abandoning clear holdings of the past that those principlescontradict. We seemed to be doing that in this area. Having affirmatively suggested that the "physical presence" rule
could be reconciled with our new jurisprudence, we oughtnot visit economic hardship upon those who took us at our

word. We have recently told lower courts that "[i]f a prece-dent of this Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of deci-sions, [they] should follow the case which directly controls,
leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its owndecisions."

Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American
Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989). It is strangely incompatible with this to demand that private parties anticipate our overrulings. It is my view, in short, that reliance
upon a square, unabandoned holding of the Supreme Court
is always justifiable reliance (though reliance alone may not
always carry the day). Finally, the "physical presence" rule
established in Bellas Hess is not "unworkable," Patterson,
supra, at 173; to the contrary, whatever else may be the substantive pros and cons of the rule, the "bright-line" regime
that it establishes, see ante, at 314, is unqualifiedly in its
favor. Justice White's concern that reaffirmance of Bellas
Hess will lead to a flurry of litigation over the meaning of
"physical presence," see post, at 331, seems to me contradicted by 25 years of experience under the decision.

For these reasons, I concur in the judgment of the Court
and join Parts I, II, and III of its opinion.

Today the Court repudiates that aspect of our decision in

of-state mail-order businesses that do not have a "physicalpresence" in the State. The Court stops short, however, of

giving Bellas Hess the complete burial it justly deserves.In my view, the Court should also overrule that part of
Bellas Hess which justifies its holding under the CommerceClause. I, therefore, respectfully dissent from Part IV.

I
In Part IV of its opinion, the majority goes to somelengths to justify the

Bellas Hess physical-presence require-ment under our Commerce Clause jurisprudence. I am unpersuaded by its interpretation of our cases. In BellasHess, the majority placed great weight on the interstate
quality of the mail-order sales, stating that "it is difficult toconceive of commercial transactions more exclusively interstate in character than the mail-order transactions here in-volved."

Id., at 759. As the majority correctly observes,the idea of prohibiting States from taxing "exclusively interstate" transactions had been an important part of our juris-prudence for many decades, ranging intermittently from
such cases as Case of State Freight Tax, 15 Wall. 232, 279(1873), through Freeman v. Hewit, 329 U. S. 249, 256 (1946),
and Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. O'Connor, 340 U. S. 602(1951). But though it recognizes that

Bellas Hess was de-cided amidst an upheaval in our Commerce Clause jurisprudence, in which we began to hold that "a State, with properdrafting, may tax exclusively interstate commerce so long as
the tax does not create any effect forbidden by the Com-merce Clause," Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430
U. S. 274, 285 (1977), the majority draws entirely the wrongconclusion from this period of ferment.

The Court attempts to paint Bellas Hess in a different huefrom

Freeman and Spector because the former "did not rely"on labeling taxes that had "direct" and "indirect" effects on

interstate commerce. See ante, at 310. Thus, the Courtconcludes, Bellas Hess "did not automatically fall with Free504us1$77K 04-23-96 09:39:54 PAGES OPINPGT

man and its progeny" in our decision in Complete Auto.See

ante, at 311. I am unpersuaded by this attempt to
distinguish Bellas Hess from Freeman and Spector, both ofwhich were repudiated by this Court. See

Complete Auto,
supra, at 288-289, and n. 15. What we disavowed in Complete Auto was not just the "formal distinction between `di-rect' and `indirect' taxes on interstate commerce,"

ante, at
310, but also the whole notion underlying the Bellas Hessphysical-presence rule--that "interstate commerce is immune from state taxation," Complete Auto, supra, at 288.The Court compounds its misreading by attempting to
show that Bellas Hess "is not inconsistent with Complete
Auto and our recent cases." Ante, at 311. This will be news
to commentators, who have rightly criticized Bellas Hess.1Indeed, the majority displays no small amount of audacity in

claiming that our decision in National Geographic Societyv.

California Bd. of Equalization, 430 U. S. 551, 559 (1977),
which was rendered several weeks after Complete Auto,
reaffirmed the continuing vitality of Bellas Hess. See ante,
at 311.

Our decision in that case did just the opposite. National
Geographic held that the National Geographic Society was
liable for use tax collection responsibilities in California.
The Society conducted an out-of-state mail-order business
similar to the one at issue here and in Bellas Hess, and in
addition, maintained two small offices in California that solicited advertisements for National Geographic Magazine.
The Society argued that its physical presence in California
was unrelated to its mail-order sales, and thus that the Bel1 See, e. g., P. Hartman, Federal Limitations on State and Local Taxation

las Hess rule compelled us to hold that the tax collectionresponsibilities could not be imposed. We expressly rejected that view, holding that the "requisite nexus for requir-ing an out-of-state seller [the Society] to collect and pay the
use tax is not whether the duty to collect the use tax relatesto the seller's activities carried on within the State, but simply whether the facts demonstrate `some definite link, someminimum connection, between (the State and) the

person . . .it seeks to tax.' " 430 U. S., at 561 (citation omitted).

By decoupling any notion of a transactional nexus fromthe inquiry, the National Geographic Court in fact repudiated the free trade rationale of the Bellas Hess majority.Instead, the

National Geographic Court relied on a dueprocess-type minimum contacts analysis that examined

whether a link existed between the seller and the Statewholly apart from the seller's in-state transaction that was
being taxed. Citations to Bellas Hess notwithstanding, see430 U. S., at 559, it is clear that rather than adopting the
rationale of Bellas Hess, the National Geographic Court was
instead politely brushing it aside. Even were I to agreethat the free trade rationale embodied in

Bellas Hess' rule
against taxes of purely interstate sales was required by ourcases prior to 1967, therefore, I see no basis in the majority's

opening premise that this substantive underpinning of Bellas
Hess has not since been disavowed by our cases.2

2 Similarly, I am unconvinced by the majority's reliance on subsequent
decisions that have cited Bellas Hess. See ante, at 311. In D. H. Holmes
Co. v. McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 33 (1988), for example, we distinguished
Bellas Hess on the basis of the company's "significant economic presence
in Louisiana, its many connections with the State, and the direct benefits
it receives from Louisiana in conducting its business." We then went on
to note that the situation presented was much more analogous to that in
National Geographic Society v. California Bd. of Equalization, 430 U. S.
551 (1977). See 486 U. S., at 33-34. In Commonwealth Edison Co. v.
Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 626 (1981), the Court cited Bellas Hess not to
revalidate the physical-presence requirement, but rather to establish that
a "nexus" must exist to justify imposition of a state tax. And finally, in

The Court next launches into an uncharted and treacher-ous foray into differentiating between the "nexus" requirements under the Due Process and Commerce Clauses. Asthe Court explains: "Despite the similarity in phrasing, the
nexus requirements of the Due Process and CommerceClauses are not identical. The two standards are animated
by different constitutional concerns and policies." Ante, at312. The due process nexus, which the Court properly holds
is met in this case, see ante, at Part III, "concerns the funda-mental fairness of governmental activity." Ante, at 312.
The Commerce Clause nexus requirement, on the other hand,is "informed not so much by concerns about fairness for the
individual defendant as by structural concerns about the ef-fects of state regulation on the national economy."

Ibid.Citing Complete Auto, the Court then explains that the

Commerce Clause nexus requirement is not "like due proc-ess' `minimum contacts' requirement, a proxy for notice, but
rather a means for limiting state burdens on interstate com-merce." Ante, at 313. This is very curious, because parts
two and three of the Complete Auto test, which require fairapportionment and nondiscrimination in order that interstate commerce not be unduly burdened, now appear to be-come the animating features of the nexus requirement, which
is the first prong of the Complete Auto inquiry. The Courtfreely acknowledges that there is no authority for this novel
interpretation of our cases and that we have never beforefound, as we do in this case, sufficient contacts for due process purposes but an insufficient nexus under the CommerceClause. See ante, at 313-314, and n. 6.

The majority's attempt to disavow language in our opin-ions acknowledging the presence of due process requireMobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes of Vt., 445 U. S. 425, 437 (1980),
the Court cited Bellas Hess for the due process requirements necessary
to sustain a tax. In my view, these citations hardly signal the continuing
support of Bellas Hess that the majority seems to find persuasive.

ments in the Complete Auto test is also unpersuasive. See
ante, at 313-314, n. 7 (citing Trinova Corp. v. Michigan Dept.
of Treasury, 498 U. S. 358, 373 (1991)). Instead of explain-ing the doctrinal origins of the Commerce Clause nexus requirement, the majority breezily announces the rule and
moves on to other matters. See ante, at 313-314. In myview, before resting on the assertion that the Constitution

mandates inquiry into two readily distinct "nexus" require-ments, it would seem prudent to discern the origins of the
"nexus" requirement in order better to understand whetherthe Court's concern traditionally has been with the fairness
of a State's tax or some other value.

The cases from which the Complete Auto Court derived
the nexus requirement in its four-part test convince me that
the issue of "nexus" is really a due process fairness inquiry.
In explaining the sources of the four-part inquiry in Complete Auto, the Court relied heavily on Justice Rutledge's
separate concurring opinion in Freeman v. Hewit, 329 U. S.
249 (1946), the case whose majority opinion the Complete
Auto Court was in the process of comprehensively disavowing. Instead of the formalistic inquiry into whether the
State was taxing interstate commerce, the Complete Auto
Court adopted the more functionalist approach of Justice
Rutledge in Freeman. See Complete Auto, 430 U. S., at
280-281. In conducting his inquiry, Justice Rutledge used
language that by now should be familiar, arguing that a tax
was unconstitutional if the activity lacked a sufficient connection to the State to give "jurisdiction to tax," Freeman,
supra, at 271; or if the tax discriminated against interstate
commerce; or if the activity was subjected to multiple tax
burdens. 329 U. S., at 276-277. Justice Rutledge later refined these principles in Memphis Natural Gas Co. v. Stone,
335 U. S. 80 (1948), in which he described the principles that
the Complete Auto Court would later substantially adopt:
"[I]t is enough for me to sustain the tax imposed in this case
that it is one clearly within the state's power to lay insofar

Opinion of White, J.
as any limitation of due process or `jurisdiction to tax' in thatsense is concerned; it is nondiscriminatory . . . ; [it] is duly

apportioned . . . ; and cannot be repeated by any other state."335 U. S., at 96-97 (concurring opinion) (footnotes omitted).

By the time the Court decided Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450 (1959), JusticeRutledge was no longer on the Court, but his view of the

nexus requirement as grounded in the Due Process Clausewas decisively adopted. In rejecting challenges to a state
tax based on the Due Process and Commerce Clauses, theCourt stated: "The taxes imposed are levied only on that
portion of the taxpayer's net income which arises from its
activities within the taxing State. These activities form a
sufficient `nexus between such a tax and transactions within
a state for which the tax is an exaction.' " Id., at 464 (citation omitted). The Court went on to observe that "[i]t
strains reality to say, in terms of our decisions, that each of
the corporations here was not sufficiently involved in local
events to forge `some definite link, some minimum connection' sufficient to satisfy due process requirements." Id., at
464-465 (quoting Miller Brothers Co. v. Maryland, 347 U. S.
340, 344-345 (1954)). When the Court announced its fourpart synthesis in Complete Auto, the nexus requirement was
definitely traceable to concerns grounded in the Due Process
Clause, and not the Commerce Clause, as the Court's discussion of the doctrinal antecedents for its rule made clear.
See Complete Auto, supra, at 281-282, 285. For the Court

now to assert that our Commerce Clause jurisprudence supports a separate notion of nexus is without precedent or
explanation.

Even were there to be such an independent requirement
under the Commerce Clause, there is no relationship between the physical-presence/nexus rule the Court retains
and Commerce Clause considerations that allegedly justify
it. Perhaps long ago a seller's "physical presence" was a
sufficient part of a trade to condition imposition of a tax on

Opinion of White, J.
such presence. But in today's economy, physical presencefrequently has very little to do with a transaction a State

might seek to tax. Wire transfers of money involving bil-lions of dollars occur every day; purchasers place orders with
sellers by fax, phone, and computer linkup; sellers ship goodsby air, road, and sea through sundry delivery services without leaving their place of business. It is certainly true thatthe days of the door-to-door salesperson are not gone. Nevertheless, an out-of-state direct marketer derives numerouscommercial benefits from the State in which it does business. These advantages include laws establishing soundlocal banking institutions to support credit transactions;
courts to ensure collection of the purchase price from theseller's customers; means of waste disposal from garbage
generated by mail-order solicitations; and creation and en-forcement of consumer protection laws, which protect buyers
and sellers alike, the former by ensuring that they will havea ready means of protecting against fraud, and the latter by
creating a climate of consumer confidence that inures to thebenefit of reputable dealers in mail-order transactions. To
create, for the first time, a nexus requirement under theCommerce Clause independent of that established for due
process purposes is one thing; to attempt to justify an anach-ronistic notion of physical presence in economic terms is
quite another. III

The illogic of retaining the physical-presence requirementin these circumstances is palpable. Under the majority's
analysis, and our decision in National Geographic, an out-of-state seller with one salesperson in a State would be subject
to use tax collection burdens on its entire mail-order saleseven if those sales were unrelated to the salesperson's solicitation efforts. By contrast, an out-of-state seller in a neigh-boring State could be the dominant business in the putative
taxing State, creating the greatest infrastructure burdensand undercutting the State's home companies by its compara504us1$77K 04-23-96 09:39:54 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of White, J.
tive price advantage in selling products free of use taxes,and yet not have to collect such taxes if it lacks a physical

presence in the taxing State. The majority clings to thephysical-presence rule not because of any logical relation to
fairness or any economic rationale related to principles un-derlying the Commerce Clause, but simply out of the supposed convenience of having a bright-line rule. I am lessimpressed by the convenience of such adherence than the
unfairness it produces. Here, convenience should give way.Cf.

Complete Auto, supra, at 289, n. 15 ("We believe, how-ever, that administrative convenience . . . is insufficient justification for abandoning the principle that `interstate com-merce may be made to pay its way' ").

Also very questionable is the rationality of perpetuatinga rule that creates an interstate tax shelter for one form
of business--mail-order sellers--but no countervailing ad-vantage for its competitors. If the Commerce Clause was
intended to put businesses on an even playing field, the ma-jority's rule is hardly a way to achieve that goal. Indeed,
arguably even under the majority's explanation for its "Com-merce Clause nexus" requirement, the unfairness of its rule
on retailers other than direct marketers should be takeninto account. See ante, at 312 (stating that the Commerce
Clause nexus requirement addresses the "structural con-cerns about the effects of state regulation on the national
economy"). I would think that protectionist rules favoring a$180-billion-a-year industry might come within the scope of
such "structural concerns." See Brief for State of New Jer-sey as

Amicus Curiae 4. IV

The Court attempts to justify what it rightly acknowl-edges is an "artificial" rule in several ways. See ante, at
315. First, it asserts that the Bellas Hess principle "firmlyestablishes the boundaries of legitimate state authority to impose a duty to collect sales and use taxes and reduces litigationconcerning those taxes." Ante, at 315. It is very doubtful,

Opinion of White, J.
however, that the Court's opinion can achieve its aims. Cer-tainly our cases now demonstrate two "bright-line" rules for

mail-order sellers to follow: Under the physical-presence re-quirement reaffirmed here, they will not be subjected to use
tax collection if they have no physical presence in the tax-ing State; under the

National Geographic rule, mail-ordersellers will be subject to use tax collection if they have

some presence in the taxing State even if that activity hasno relation to the transaction being taxed. See National
Geographic, 430 U. S., at 560-562. Between these narrowlines lies the issue of what constitutes the requisite "physical presence" to justify imposition of use tax collectionresponsibilities.

Instead of confronting this question head on, the majorityoffers only a cursory analysis of whether Quill's physical
presence in North Dakota was sufficient to justify its use taxcollection burdens, despite briefing on this point by the
State.3 See Brief for Respondent 45-47. North Dakotacontends that even should the Court reaffirm the

Bellas Hessrule, Quill's physical presence in North Dakota was sufficient

to justify application of its use tax collection law. Quill con-cedes it owns software sent to its North Dakota customers,
but suggests that such property is insufficient to justify afinding of nexus. In my view, the question of Quill's actual
physical presence is sufficiently close to cast doubt on themajority's confidence that it is propounding a truly "brightline" rule. Reasonable minds surely can, and will, differover what showing is required to make out a "physical pres3 Instead of remanding for consideration of whether Quill's ownership of
software constitutes sufficient physical presence under its new Commerce
Clause nexus requirement, the majority concludes as a matter of law that
it does not. See ante, at 315, n. 8. In so doing, the majority rebuffs
North Dakota's challenge without setting out any clear standard for what
meets the Commerce Clause physical-presence nexus standard and without affording the State an opportunity on remand to attempt to develop
facts or otherwise to argue that Quill's presence is constitutionally
sufficient.

ence" adequate to justify imposing responsibilities for usetax collection. And given the estimated loss in revenue to

States of more than $3.2 billion this year alone, see Brief forRespondent 9, it is a sure bet that the vagaries of "physical
presence" will be tested to their fullest in our courts.

The majority next explains that its "bright-line" rule en-courages "settled expectations" and business investment.

Ante, at 316. Though legal certainty promotes businessconfidence, the mail-order business has grown exponentially
despite the long line of our post-Bellas Hess precedents thatsignaled the demise of the physical-presence requirement.
Moreover, the Court's seeming but inadequate justification
of encouraging settled expectations in fact connotes a substantive economic decision to favor out-of-state direct marketers to the detriment of other retailers. By justifying the
Bellas Hess rule in terms of "the mail-order industry's dramatic growth over the last quarter century," ante, at 316, the
Court is effectively imposing its own economic preferences
in deciding this case. The Court's invitation to Congress to
legislate in this area signals that its preferences are not immutable, but its approach is different from past instances in
which we have deferred to state legislatures when they enacted tax obligations on the States' shares of interstate commerce. See, e. g., Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U. S. 252 (1989);
Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609 (1981).

Finally, the Court accords far greater weight to stare decisis than was given to that principle in Complete Auto itself.
As that case demonstrates, we have not been averse to overruling our precedents under the Commerce Clause when
they have become anachronistic in light of later decisions.
See Complete Auto, 430 U. S., at 288-289. One typically invoked rationale for stare decisis--an unwillingness to upset
settled expectations--is particularly weak in this case. It is
unreasonable for companies such as Quill to invoke a "settled
expectation" in conducting affairs without being taxed. Neither Quill nor any of its amici point to any investment deci504us1$77K 04-23-96 09:39:54 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of White, J.
sions or reliance interests that suggest any unfairness inoverturning Bellas Hess. And the costs of compliance with

the rule, in light of today's modern computer and softwaretechnology, appear to be nominal. See Brief for Respondent
40; Brief for State of New Jersey as Amicus Curiae 18. Tothe extent Quill developed any reliance on the old rule, I
would submit that its reliance was unreasonable because ofits failure to comply with the law as enacted by the North
Dakota State Legislature. Instead of rewarding companiesfor ignoring the studied judgments of duly elected officials,
we should insist that the appropriate way to challenge a taxas unconstitutional is to pay it (or in this case collect it and
remit it or place it in escrow) and then sue for declaratoryjudgment and refund.

4 Quill's refusal to comply with a state

tax statute prior to its being held unconstitutional hardlymerits a determination that its reliance interests were

reasonable.The Court hints, but does not state directly, that a basis
for its invocation of stare decisis is a fear that overturningBellas Hess will lead to the imposition of retroactive liability.
Ante, at 317, 318, n. 10. See James B. Beam Distilling Co.v. Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991). As I thought in that case,
such fears are groundless because no one can "sensibly insiston automatic retroactivity for any and all judicial decisions
in the federal system." Id., at 546 (White, J., concurringin judgment). Since we specifically limited the question on
which certiorari was granted in order not to consider thepotential retroactive effects of overruling

Bellas Hess, I be-lieve we should leave that issue for another day. If indeed

fears about retroactivity are driving the Court's decision inthis case, we would be better served, in my view, to address

generally J. Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation $ 58A.05 (1992).
North Dakota appears to follow the same principle. See First Bank of

those concerns directly rather than permit them to infect ourformulation of the applicable substantive rule.

Although Congress can and should address itself to thisarea of law, we should not adhere to a decision, however right
it was at the time, that by reason of later cases and economicreality can no longer be rationally justified. The Commerce

CHEMICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC. v. HUNT,GOVERNOR OF ALABAMA,

et al.

certiorari to the supreme court of alabama

No. 91-471. Argued April 21, 1992--Decided June 1, 1992
Petitioner, Chemical Waste Management, Inc., operates a commercial hazardous waste land disposal facility in Emelle, Alabama, that receives
both in-state and out-of-state wastes. An Alabama Act imposes, inter
alia, a fee on hazardous wastes disposed of at in-state commercial facilities, and an additional fee on hazardous wastes generated outside, but
disposed of inside, the State. Petitioner filed suit in state court, requesting declaratory relief against respondent state officials and seeking
to enjoin the Act's enforcement. The trial court declared, among other
things, that the additional fee violated the Commerce Clause, finding
that the only basis for the fee is the waste's origin. The State Supreme
Court reversed, holding that the fee advanced legitimate local purposes
that could not be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory
alternatives.

Held:

1. Alabama's differential treatment of out-of-state waste violates the
Commerce Clause. Pp. 339-349.

(a) No State may attempt to isolate itself from a problem common
to the several States by raising barriers to the free flow of interstate
commerce. Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617; Fort Gratiot
Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, post,
p. 353. The State Act's additional fee facially discriminates against hazardous waste generated outside Alabama, and the Act has plainly discouraged the full operation of petitioner's facility. Such a burdensome
tax imposed on interstate commerce alone is generally forbidden and
is typically struck down without further inquiry. However, here the
State argues that the additional fee serves legitimate local purposes.
Pp. 339-343.

(b) Alabama has not met its burden of showing the unavailability of nondiscriminatory alternatives adequate to preserve the local interests at stake. See Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising
Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333, 353. Alabama's concern about the volume of
waste entering the Emelle facility could be alleviated by less discriminatory means--such as applying an additional fee on all hazardous waste
disposed of within Alabama, a per-mile tax on all vehicles transporting
such waste across state roads, or an evenhanded cap on the total ton504us1$78D 04-23-96 09:40:32 PAGES OPINPGT

335Cite as: 504 U. S. 334 (1992)
Syllabus
nage landfilled at Emelle--which would curtail volume from all sources.
Additionally, any concern touching on environmental conservation and
Alabama citizens' health and safety does not vary with the waste's point
of origin, and the State has the power to monitor and regulate more
closely the transportation and disposal of all hazardous waste within its
borders. Even possible future financial and environmental risks to be
borne by Alabama do not vary with the waste's State of origin in a way
allowing foreign, but not local, waste to be burdened. Pp. 343-346.

(c) This Court's decisions regarding quarantine laws do not counsel
a different conclusion. The additional fee may not legitimately be
deemed a quarantine law because Alabama permits both the generation
and landfilling of hazardous waste within its borders and the importation of additional hazardous waste. Moreover, the quarantine laws upheld by this Court "did not discriminate against interstate commerce as
such, but simply prevented traffic in noxious articles, whatever their
origin." Philadelphia v. New Jersey, supra, at 629. This Court's decision in Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131--upholding a state ban on the
importation of baitfish after Maine showed that such fish were subject
to parasites foreign to in-state baitfish and that there were no less discriminatory means of protecting its natural resources--likewise offers
no respite to Alabama, since here the hazardous waste is the same
regardless of its point of origin and adequate means other than overt
discrimination meet Alabama's concerns. Pp. 346-348.

2. On remand the Alabama Supreme Court must consider the appropriate relief to petitioner. See, e. g., McKesson Corp. v. Division of
Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulations,
496 U. S. 18, 31. Pp. 348-349.

Opinion of the Court
Supreme Court held that this differential treatment does notviolate the Commerce Clause. We reverse.

I
Petitioner, Chemical Waste Management, Inc., a Delawarecorporation with its principal place of business in Oak Brook,

Illinois, owns and operates one of the Nation's oldest com-mercial hazardous waste land disposal facilities, located in
Emelle, Alabama. Opened in 1977 and acquired by peti-tioner in 1978, the Emelle facility is a hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facility operating pursuant topermits issued by the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Actof 1976 (RCRA), 90 Stat. 2795, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 6901
et seq., and the Toxic Substances Control Act, 90 Stat. 2003,as amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 2601

et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. II),and by the State of Alabama under Ala. Code $ 22-30-12(i)

(1990). Alabama is 1 of only 16 States that have commercialhazardous waste landfills, and the Emelle facility is the
largest of the 21 landfills of this kind located in these 16States. Brief for National Governors' Assn. et al. as

AmiciCuriae 3, citing E. Smith, EI Digest 26-27 (Mar. 1992).

The parties do not dispute that the wastes and substancesbeing landfilled at the Emelle facility "include substances
that are inherently dangerous to human health and safetyand to the environment. Such waste consists of ignitable,
corrosive, toxic and reactive wastes which contain poisonousand cancer causing chemicals and which can cause birth defects, genetic damage, blindness, crippling and death." 1 584

1 As used in RCRA, 42 U. S. C. $ 6903(5), the term "hazardous waste"
means:
"a solid waste, or combination of solid wastes, which because of its
quantity, concentration, or physical, chemical, or infectious characteristics
may--

increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible, illness; or

Opinion of the Court
So. 2d 1367, 1373 (Ala. 1991). Increasing amounts of out-of-state hazardous wastes are shipped to the Emelle facility for

permanent storage each year. From 1985 through 1989, thetonnage of hazardous waste received per year has more than
doubled, increasing from 341,000 tons in 1985 to 788,000 tonsby 1989. Of this, up to 90% of the tonnage permanently buried each year is shipped in from other States.Against this backdrop Alabama enacted Act No. 90-326
(Act). Ala. Code $$ 22-30B-1 to 22-30B-18 (1990 and Supp.1991). Among other provisions, the Act includes a "cap"
that generally limits the amount of hazardous wastes orsubstances

2 that may be disposed of in any 1-year period,

and the amount of hazardous waste disposed of during thefirst year under the Act's new fees becomes the permanent

ceiling in subsequent years. Ala. Code $ 22-30B-2.3 (1990).The cap applies to commercial facilities that dispose of over
100,000 tons of hazardous wastes or substances per year, butonly the Emelle facility, as the only commercial facility operating within Alabama, meets this description. The Act alsoimposes a "base fee" of $25.60 per ton on all hazardous
wastes and substances disposed of at commercial facilities,to be paid by the operator of the facility. Ala. Code $ 22-
30B-2(a) (Supp. 1991). Finally, the Act imposes the "addi-tional fee" at issue here, which states in full:

"For waste and substances which are generated out-side of Alabama and disposed of at a commercial site for

"(B) pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or
the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, or disposed of, or otherwise managed."

RCRA directs the EPA to establish a comprehensive "cradle to grave"
system regulating the generation, transport, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous wastes, $$ 6921-6939b, which includes identification and
listing of hazardous wastes, $ 6921. At present, there are more than 500
such listed wastes. See 40 CFR pt. 261, subpt. D (1991).

2 "Hazardous substance(s)" and "hazardous waste(s)" are defined terms

in the Act, $$ 22-30B-1(3) and 22-30B-1(4), but these definitions largely
parallel the meanings given under federal law.

the disposal of hazardous waste or hazardous substances
in Alabama, an additional fee shall be levied at the rate
of $72.00 per ton." $ 22-30B-2(b).

Petitioner filed suit in state court requesting declaratory
relief against respondents and seeking to enjoin enforcement
of the Act. In addition to state-law claims, petitioner contended that the Act violated the Commerce, Due Process,
and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution, and was pre-empted by various federal statutes. The
trial court declared the base fee and the cap provisions of
the Act to be valid and constitutional; but, finding the only
basis for the additional fee to be the origin of the waste, the
trial court declared it to be in violation of the Commerce
Clause. App. to Pet. for Cert. 83a-88a. Both sides appealed. The Alabama Supreme Court affirmed the rulings
concerning the base fee and cap provisions but reversed the
decision regarding the additional fee. The court held that
the fee at issue advanced legitimate local purposes that could
not be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory
alternatives and was therefore valid under the Commerce
Clause. 584 So. 2d, at 1390.

Chemical Waste Management, Inc., petitioned for writ of
certiorari, challenging all aspects of the Act. Because of the
importance of the federal question and the likelihood that it
had been decided in a way conflicting with applicable decisions of this Court, this Court's Rule 10.1(c), we granted
certiorari limited to petitioner's Commerce Clause challenge to the additional fee. 502 U. S. 1070 (1992). We now
reverse.

Opinion of the Court
of interstate trade.3 Today, in Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, post,
p. 353, we have also considered a Commerce Clause challengeto a Michigan law prohibiting private landfill operators from

accepting solid waste originating outside the county in which
their facilities operate. In striking down that law, we ad-hered to our decision in

Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437
U. S. 617 (1978), where we found New Jersey's prohibition ofsolid waste from outside that State to amount to economic

protectionism barred by the Commerce Clause:

" `[T]he evil of protectionism can reside in legislative
means as well as legislative ends. Thus, it does not
matter whether the ultimate aim of ch. 363 is to reduce
the waste disposal costs of New Jersey residents or to
save remaining open lands from pollution, for we assume
New Jersey has every right to protect its residents'

3 The Alabama Supreme Court assumed that the disposal of hazardous
waste constituted an article of commerce, and the State does not explicitly
argue here to the contrary. In Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v.
Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, post, at 359, we have reaffirmed
the idea that "[s]olid waste, even if it has no value, is an article of commerce." As stated in Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 622-623
(1978): "All objects of interstate trade merit Commerce Clause protection;
none is excluded by definition at the outset. . . . Just as Congress has
power to regulate the interstate movement of these wastes, States are not
free from constitutional scrutiny when they restrict that movement."
The definition of "hazardous waste" makes clear that it is simply a grade
of solid waste, albeit one of particularly noxious and dangerous propensities, see n. 1, supra, but whether the business arrangements between outof-state generators of hazardous waste and the Alabama operator of a
hazardous waste landfill are viewed as "sales" of hazardous waste or "purchases" of transportation and disposal services, "the commercial transactions unquestionably have an interstate character. The Commerce Clause
thus imposes some constraints on [Alabama's] ability to regulate these
transactions." Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, post, at 359. See National Solid Wastes Management Assn. v. Alabama Dept. of Environmental Mgmt., 910 F. 2d 713, 718-719 (CA11 1990), modified, 924 F. 2d

Opinion of the Court
pocketbooks as well as their environment. And it may
be assumed as well that New Jersey may pursue those
ends by slowing the flow of all waste into the State's
remaining landfills, even though interstate commerce
may incidentally be affected. But whatever New Jersey's ultimate purpose, it may not be accompanied by
discriminating against articles of commerce coming from
outside the State unless there is some reason, apart from
their origin, to treat them differently. Both on its face
and in its plain effect, ch. 363 violates this principle of
nondiscrimination.

" `The Court has consistently found parochial legislation of this kind to be constitutionally invalid, whether
the ultimate aim of the legislation was to assure a steady
supply of milk by erecting barriers to allegedly ruinous
outside competition, Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294

To this list may be added cases striking down a tax discriminating against interstate commerce, even where such tax
was designed to encourage the use of ethanol and thereby
reduce harmful exhaust emissions, New Energy Co. of Ind.

State from the national economy." Philadelphia v. New
Jersey, supra, at 627.

The Act's additional fee facially discriminates against hazardous waste generated in States other than Alabama, and
the Act overall has plainly discouraged the full operation of
petitioner's Emelle facility.4 Such burdensome taxes imposed on interstate commerce alone are generally forbidden:
"[A] State may not tax a transaction or incident more heavily
when it crosses state lines than when it occurs entirely
within the State." Armco Inc. v. Hardesty, 467 U. S. 638,
642 (1984); see also Walling v. Michigan, 116 U. S. 446, 455
(1886); Guy v. Baltimore, 100 U. S. 434, 439 (1880). Once a
state tax is found to discriminate against out-of-state commerce, it is typically struck down without further inquiry.
See, e. g., Westinghouse Electric Corp. v. Tully, 466 U. S. 388,
406-407 (1984); Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 759-
760 (1981); Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm'n, 429
U. S. 318, 336-337 (1977).

The State, however, argues that the additional fee imposed
on out-of-state hazardous waste serves legitimate local purposes related to its citizens' health and safety. Because the
additional fee discriminates both on its face and in practical
effect, the burden falls on the State "to justify it both in
terms of the local benefits flowing from the statute and the
unavailability of nondiscriminatory alternatives adequate to
preserve the local interests at stake." Hunt v. Washington
State Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333, 353 (1977);

The State's argument here does not significantly differfrom the Alabama Supreme Court's conclusions on the legitimate local purposes of the additional fee imposed, whichwere:

"The Additional Fee serves these legitimate local pur-poses that cannot be adequately served by reasonable
nondiscriminatory alternatives: (1) protection of thehealth and safety of the citizens of Alabama from toxic
substances; (2) conservation of the environment and thestate's natural resources; (3) provision for compensatory
revenue for the costs and burdens that out-of-statewaste generators impose by dumping their hazardous
waste in Alabama; (4) reduction of the overall flow ofwastes traveling on the state's highways, which flow creates a great risk to the health and safety of the state'scitizens." 584 So. 2d, at 1389.

These may all be legitimate local interests, and petitionerhas not attacked them. But only rhetoric, and not explanation, emerges as to why Alabama targets only interstatehazardous waste to meet these goals. As found by the trial
court, "[a]lthough the Legislature imposed an additional feeof $72.00 per ton on waste generated outside Alabama, there

5 To some extent the State attempts to avail itself of the more flexible
approach outlined in, e. g., Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York
State Liquor Authority, 476 U. S. 573, 579 (1986), and Pike v. Bruce
Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970), but this lesser scrutiny is only
available "where other legislative objectives are credibly advanced and
there is no patent discrimination against interstate trade." Philadelphia
v. New Jersey, 437 U. S., at 624 (emphasis added). We find no room here
to say that the Act presents "effects upon interstate commerce that are
only incidental," ibid., for the Act's additional fee on its face targets only
out-of-state hazardous waste. While no "clear line" separates close cases
on which scrutiny should apply, "this is not a close case." Wyoming v.
Oklahoma, 502 U. S. 437, 455, n. 12 (1992).

is absolutely no evidence before this Court that waste gener-ated outside Alabama is more dangerous than waste generated in Alabama. The Court finds under the facts of thiscase that the only basis for the additional fee is the origin of
the waste." App. to Pet. for Cert. 83a-84a. In the face of
such findings, invalidity under the Commerce Clause neces-sarily follows, for "whatever [Alabama's] ultimate purpose, it

may not be accomplished by discriminating against articlesof commerce coming from outside the State unless there is
some reason, apart from their origin, to treat them differ-ently."

Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S., at 626-627;
see New Energy Co., 486 U. S., at 279-280. The burden is onthe State to show that "the

discrimination is demonstrably
justified by a valid factor unrelated to economic protectionism," 6 Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U. S. 437, 454 (1992) (em-phasis added), and it has not carried this burden. Cf.

Fort
Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, post, at 361.

Ultimately, the State's concern focuses on the volume of
the waste entering the Emelle facility.7 Less discriminatory

6 The Alabama Supreme Court found no "economic protectionism" here,
and thus purported to distinguish Philadelphia v. New Jersey, based on
its conclusions that the legislature was motivated by public health and
environmental concerns. 584 So. 2d 1367, 1388-1389 (1991). This narrow
focus on the intended consequence of the additional fee does not conform
to our precedents, for "[a] finding that state legislation constitutes `economic protectionism' may be made on the basis of either discriminatory
purpose, see Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S.
333, 352-353 (1977), or discriminatory effect, see Philadelphia v. New
Jersey, supra." Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263, 270 (1984).
The "virtually per se rule of invalidity," Philadelphia v. New Jersey,
supra, at 624, applies "not only to laws motivated solely by a desire to
protect local industries from out-of-state competition, but also to laws that
respond to legitimate local concerns by discriminating arbitrarily against
interstate trade." Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131, 148, n. 19 (1986).

Opinion of the Court
alternatives, however, are available to alleviate this concern,not the least of which are a generally applicable per-ton additional fee on all hazardous waste disposed of within Ala-bama, cf. Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S.
609, 619 (1981), or a per-mile tax on all vehicles transporting
hazardous waste across Alabama roads, cf. American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266, 286 (1987), or an
evenhanded cap on the total tonnage landfilled at Emelle, see
Philadelphia v. New Jersey, supra, at 626, which would curtail volume from all sources.8 To the extent Alabama's con-cern touches environmental conservation and the health and

safety of its citizens, such concern does not vary with thepoint of origin of the waste, and it remains within the State's
power to monitor and regulate more closely the transporta8 The State asserts: "An equal fee, at any level, would necessarily fail
to serve the State's purpose. An equal fee high enough to provide any
significant deterrent to the importation of hazardous waste for landfilling
in the State would amount to an attempt by the State to avoid its responsibility to deal with its own problems, by tending to cause in-state waste to
be exported for disposal. An equal fee not so high as to amount to an
attempt to force Alabama's own problems to be borne by citizens of other
states would fail to provide any significant reduction in the enormous volumes of imported hazardous waste being dumped in the State. At the
point where an equal fee would become effective to serve the State's purpose in protecting public health and the environment from uncontrolled
volumes of imported waste, that equal fee would also become an avoidance
of the State's responsibility to deal with its own waste problems." Id., at
46. These assertions are without record support and in any event do not
suffice to validate plain discrimination against interstate commerce. See
New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 280 (1988); Hale v.
Bimco Trading, Inc., 306 U. S. 375, 380 (1939): "That no Florida cement
needs any inspection while all foreign cement requires inspection at a cost
of fifteen cents per hundredweight is too violent an assumption to justify
the discrimination here disclosed." The additional fee is certainly not a
" `last ditch' attempt" to meet Alabama's expressed purposes "after nondiscriminatory alternatives have proved unfeasible. It is rather a choice of
the most discriminatory [tax] even though nondiscriminatory alternatives
would seem likely to fulfill the State's purported legitimate local purpose
more effectively." Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U. S. 322, 338 (1979).

tion and disposal of all hazardous waste within its borders.Even with the possible future financial and environmental

risks to be borne by Alabama, such risks likewise do notvary with the waste's State of origin in a way allowing foreign, but not local, waste to be burdened.9 In sum, we findthe additional fee to be "an obvious effort to saddle those
outside the State" with most of the burden of slowing theflow of waste into the Emelle facility.

Philadelphia v. NewJersey, 437 U. S., at 629. "That legislative effort is clearly

9 The State presents no argument here, as it did below, that the additional fee makes out-of-state generators pay their "fair share" of the costs
of Alabama waste disposal facilities, or that the additional fee is justified
as a "compensatory tax." The trial court rejected these arguments, App.
to Pet. for Cert. 88a, n. 6., finding the former foreclosed by American
Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266, 287-289 (1987), and the
latter to be factually unsupported by a requisite "substantially equivalent"
tax imposed solely on in-state waste, as required by, e. g., Tyler Pipe Industries, Inc. v. Washington State Dept. of Revenue, 483 U. S. 232, 242-
244 (1987). Various amici assert that the discrimination patent in the
Act's additional fee is consistent with congressional authorization. We
pretermit this issue, for it was not the basis for the decision below and
has not been briefed or argued by the parties here.

waste within its borders and the importation of still more
hazardous waste subject to payment of the additional fee.
In any event, while it is true that certain quarantine laws
have not been considered forbidden protectionist measures,
even though directed against out-of-state commerce, those
laws "did not discriminate against interstate commerce as
such, but simply prevented traffic in noxious articles, whatever their origin." Philadelphia v. New Jersey, supra, at
629.11 As the Court stated in Guy v. Baltimore, 100 U. S.,
at 443:

"In the exercise of its police powers, a State may exclude from its territory, or prohibit the sale therein of
any articles which, in its judgment, fairly exercised, are
prejudicial to the health or which would endanger the
lives or property of its people. But if the State, under
the guise of exerting its police powers, should make such
exclusion or prohibition applicable solely to articles, of
that kind, that may be produced or manufactured in
other States, the courts would find no difficulty in holding such legislation to be in conflict with the Constitution of the United States."

Co. v. Husen, 95 U. S. 465, 472 (1878).

11 "The hostility is to the thing itself, not to merely interstate shipments
of the thing; and an undiscriminating hostility is at least nondiscriminatory. But that is not the case here. The State of Illinois is quite willing
to allow the storage and even the shipment for storage of spent nuclear
fuel in Illinois, provided only that its origin is intrastate." Illinois v.
General Elec. Co., 683 F. 2d 206, 214 (CA7 1982), cert. denied, 461 U. S.
913 (1983); cf. Oregon-Washington Co. v. Washington, supra, at 96: Inspection followed by quarantine of hay from fields infested with weevils is "a
real quarantine law, and not a mere inhibition against importation of
alfalfa from a large part of the country without regard to the condition
which might make its importation dangerous."

348 CHEMICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC. v. HUNT

Opinion of the Court
The law struck down in Philadelphia v. New Jersey left
local waste untouched, although no basis existed by which
to distinguish interstate waste. But "[i]f one is inherently
harmful, so is the other. Yet New Jersey has banned the
former while leaving its landfill sites open to the latter."
437 U. S., at 629. Here, the additional fee applies only to
interstate hazardous waste, but at all points from its entrance into Alabama until it is landfilled at the Emelle facility, every concern related to quarantine applies perforce to
local hazardous waste, which pays no additional fee. For
this reason, the additional fee does not survive the appropriate scrutiny applicable to discriminations against interstate commerce.

Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131 (1986), provides no additional justification. Maine there demonstrated that the outof-state baitfish were subject to parasites foreign to in-state
baitfish. This difference posed a threat to the State's natural resources, and absent a less discriminatory means of protecting the environment--and none was available--the importation of baitfish could properly be banned. Id., at 140.
To the contrary, the record establishes that the hazardous
waste at issue in this case is the same regardless of its point
of origin. As noted in Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, "our
conclusion would be different if the imported waste raised
health or other concerns not presented by [Alabama] waste."
Post, at 367. Because no unique threat is posed, and because adequate means other than overt discrimination meet
Alabama's concerns, Maine v. Taylor provides the State no
respite.

So ordered.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, dissenting.
I have already had occasion to set out my view that States
need not ban all waste disposal as a precondition to protecting themselves from hazardous or noxious materials brought
across the State's borders. See Philadelphia v. New Jersey,
437 U. S. 617, 629 (1978) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). In a
case also decided today, I express my further view that
States may take actions legitimately directed at the preservation of the State's natural resources, even if those actions
incidentally work to disadvantage some out-of-state waste
generators. See Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v.
Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, post, p. 368 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting). I dissent today, largely for the reasons I have set out in those two cases. Several additional
comments that pertain specifically to this case, though, are
in order.

Taxes are a recognized and effective means for discouraging the consumption of scarce commodities--in this case the
safe environment that attends appropriate disposal of hazardous wastes. Cf. 26 U. S. C. $$ 4681, 4682 (1988 ed., Supp.
III) (tax on ozone-depleting chemicals); 26 U. S. C. $ 4064 (gas
guzzler excise tax). I therefore see nothing unconstitutional
in Alabama's use of a tax to discourage the export of this
commodity to other States, when the commodity is a public
good that Alabama has helped to produce. Cf. Fort Gratiot,
post, at 372 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting). Nor do I see
any significance in the fact that Alabama has chosen to adopt
a differential tax rather than an outright ban. Nothing in
the Commerce Clause requires Alabama to adopt an "all or
nothing" regulatory approach to noxious materials coming

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
from without the State. See Mintz v. Baldwin, 289 U. S. 346(1933) (upholding State's

partial ban on cattle importation).
In short, the Court continues to err by its failure to recog-nize that waste--in this case admittedly

hazardous waste--
presents risks to the public health and environment that a
State may legitimately wish to avoid, and that the State maypursue such an objective by means less Draconian than an

outright ban. Under force of this Court's precedent, though,it increasingly appears that the only avenue by which a State
may avoid the importation of hazardous wastes is to ban suchwaste disposal altogether, regardless of the waste's source
of origin. I see little logic in creating, and nothing in the
Commerce Clause that requires us to create, such perverse
regulatory incentives. The Court errs in substantial measure because it refuses to acknowledge that a safe and attractive environment is the commodity really at issue in cases
such as this. See Fort Gratiot, post, at 369, n. (Rehnquist,
C. J., dissenting). The result is that the Court today gets it
exactly backward when it suggests that Alabama is attempting to "isolate itself from a problem common to the several
States." Ante, at 339. To the contrary, it is the 34 States
that have no hazardous waste facility whatsoever, not to
mention the remaining 15 States with facilities all smaller
than Emelle, that have isolated themselves.

There is some solace to be taken in the Court's conclusion,
ante, at 344-345, that Alabama may impose a substantial fee
on the disposal of all hazardous waste, or a per-mile fee on
all vehicles transporting such waste, or a cap on total disposals at the Emelle facility. None of these approaches provide Alabama the ability to tailor its regulations in a way
that the State will be solving only that portion of the problem that it has created. See Fort Gratiot, post, at 370-371
(Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting). But they do at least give
Alabama some mechanisms for requiring waste-generating
States to compensate Alabama for the risks the Court declares Alabama must run.

351Cite as: 504 U. S. 334 (1992)
Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
Of course, the costs of any of the proposals that the Courttoday approves will be less than fairly apportioned. For example, should Alabama adopt a flat transportation or dis-posal tax, Alabama citizens will be forced to pay a disposal
tax equal to that faced by dumpers from outside the State.
As the Court acknowledges, such taxes are a permissible ef-fort to recoup compensation for the risks imposed on the

State. Yet Alabama's general tax revenues presumably al-ready support the State's various inspection and regulatory
efforts designed to ensure the Emelle facility's safe opera-tion. Thus, Alabamians will be made to pay twice, once
through general taxation and a second time through a specific disposal fee. Permitting differential taxation would, in
part, do no more than recognize that, having been made to
bear all the risks from such hazardous waste sites, Alabama
should not in addition be made to pay more than others in
supporting activities that will help to minimize the risk.

Other mechanisms also appear open to Alabama to achieve
results similar to those that are seemingly foreclosed today.
There seems to be nothing, for example, that would prevent
Alabama from providing subsidies or other tax breaks to domestic industries that generate hazardous wastes. Or Alabama may, under the market participant doctrine, open its
own facility catering only to Alabama customers. See, e. g.,
White v. Massachusetts Council of Constr. Employers, Inc.,
460 U. S. 204, 206-208 (1983); Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S.
429, 436-437 (1980); Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426

U. S. 794, 810 (1976). But certainly we have lost our way
when we require States to perform such gymnastics, when
such performances will in turn produce little difference in
ultimate effects. In sum, the only sure byproduct of today's
decision is additional litigation. Assuming that those States
that are currently the targets for large volumes of hazardous
waste do not simply ban hazardous waste sites altogether,
they will undoubtedly continue to search for a way to limit
their risk from sites in operation. And each new arrange504us1$78D 04-23-96 09:40:32 PAGES OPINPGT

ment will generate a new legal challenge, one that will workto the principal advantage only of those States that refuse

to contribute to a solution.For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 91-636. Argued March 30, 1992--Decided June 1, 1992
The Waste Import Restrictions of Michigan's Solid Waste Management

Act (SWMA) provide that solid waste generated in another county,
State, or country cannot be accepted for disposal unless explicitly authorized in the receiving county's plan. After St. Clair County, whose
plan does not include such authorization, denied petitioner company's
1989 application for authority to accept out-of-state waste at its landfill,
petitioner filed this action seeking a judgment declaring the Waste Import Restrictions invalid under the Commerce Clause and enjoining
their enforcement. The District Court dismissed the complaint, and the
Court of Appeals affirmed. The latter court found no facial discrimination against interstate commerce because the statute does not treat outof-county waste from Michigan any differently than waste from other
States. The court also ruled that there was no actual discrimination
because petitioner had not alleged that all Michigan counties ban outof-state waste.

Held: The Waste Import Restrictions unambiguously discriminate against

interstate commerce and are appropriately characterized as protectionist measures that cannot withstand Commerce Clause scrutiny.
Pp. 358-368.

(a) Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 626-627, provides the
proper analytical framework and controls here. Under the reasoning
of that case, Michigan's Waste Import Restrictions clearly discriminate
against interstate commerce, since they authorize each county to isolate
itself from the national economy and, indeed, afford local waste producers complete protection from competition from out-of-state producers
seeking to use local disposal areas unless a county acts affirmatively to
authorize such use. Pp. 358-361.

(b) This case cannot be distinguished from Philadelphia v. New Jersey on the ground, asserted by respondents, that the Waste Import Restrictions treat waste from other Michigan counties no differently than
waste from other States and thus do not discriminate against interstate
commerce on their face or in effect. This Court's cases teach that a
State (or one of its political subdivisions) may not avoid the Commerce

Clause's strictures by curtailing the movement of articles of commerce
through subdivisions of the State, rather than through the State itself.
See, e. g., Brimmer v. Rebman, 138 U. S. 78, 82-83. Nor does the fact
that the Michigan statute allows individual counties to accept solid
waste from out of state qualify its discriminatory character. Pp. 361-363.

(c) Also rejected is respondents' argument that this case is different
from Philadelphia v. New Jersey because the SWMA constitutes a comprehensive health and safety regulation rather than "economic protectionism" of the State's limited landfill capacity. Even assuming that
other provisions of the SWMA could fairly be so characterized, the same
assumption cannot be made with respect to the Waste Import Restrictions themselves. Because those provisions unambiguously discriminate against interstate commerce, the State bears the burden of proving
that they further health and safety concerns that cannot be adequately
served by nondiscriminatory alternatives. Respondents have not met
this burden, since they have provided no valid health and safety reason
for limiting the amount of waste that a landfill operator may accept from
outside the State, but not the amount the operator may accept from
inside the State. Pp. 363-368.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
In Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 618 (1978),we held that a New Jersey law prohibiting the importation

of most " `solid or liquid waste which originated or was col-lected outside the territorial limits of the State' " violated
the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. Inthis case petitioner challenges a Michigan law that prohibits
private landfill operators from accepting solid waste thatoriginates outside the county in which their facilities are located. Adhering to our holding in the New Jersey case, weconclude that this Michigan statute is also unconstitutional.

I
In 1978, Michigan enacted its Solid Waste ManagementAct

1 (SWMA). That Act required every Michigan county to

estimate the amount of solid waste that would be generatedin the county in the next 20 years and to adopt a plan providing for its disposal at facilities that comply with statehealth standards. Mich. Comp. Laws $ 299.425 (Supp. 1991).

MICHIGAN DEPT. OF NATURAL RESOURCES

Opinion of the Court

After holding public hearings and obtaining the necessary
approval of municipalities in the county, as well as the approval of the Director of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, the County Board of Commissioners adopted
a solid waste management plan for St. Clair County. In
1987, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources issued
a permit to petitioner to operate a sanitary landfill as a solid
waste 2 disposal area in St. Clair County. See Bill Kettlewell Excavating, Inc. v. Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, 931 F. 2d 413, 414 (CA6 1991).

On December 28, 1988, the Michigan Legislature amended
the SWMA by adopting two provisions concerning the "acceptance of waste or ash generated outside the county of
disposal area." See 1988 Mich. Pub. Acts, No. 475, $ 1, codified as amended, Mich. Comp. Laws $$ 299.413a, 299.430(2)

2 The Michigan statute defines solid waste as follows:
"Sec. 7. (1) `Solid waste' means garbage, rubbish, ashes, incinerator ash,
incinerator residue, street cleanings, municipal and industrial sludges,
solid commercial and solid industrial waste, and animal waste other than
organic waste generated in the production of livestock and poultry. Solid
waste does not include the following:

"(a) Human body waste.
"(b) Organic waste generated in the production of livestock and poultry.
"(c) Liquid waste.
"(d) Ferrous or nonferrous scrap directed to a scrap metal processor or
to a reuser of ferrous or nonferrous products.

"(e) Slag or slag products directed to a slag processor or to a reuser of
slag or slag products.

"(f) Sludges and ashes managed as recycled or nondetrimental materials appropriate for agricultural or silvicultural use pursuant to a plan approved by the director.

"(g) Materials approved for emergency disposal by the director.
"(h) Source separated materials.
"(i) Site separated materials.
"(j) Fly ash or any other ash produced from the combustion of coal,
when used in the following instances . . .

"(k) Other wastes regulated by statute." Mich. Comp. Laws

Opinion of the Court
(Supp. 1991). Those amendments (Waste Import Restric-tions), which became effective immediately, provide:

"A person shall not accept for disposal solid waste . . .that is not generated in the county in which the disposal
area is located unless the acceptance of solid waste . . .that is not generated in the county is explicitly authorized in the approved county solid waste managementplan." $ 299.413a.
"In order for a disposal area to serve the disposal needsof another county, state, or country, the service . . . must
be explicitly authorized in the approved solid wastemanagement plan of the receiving county." $ 299.430(2).

In February 1989, petitioner submitted an application tothe St. Clair County Solid Waste Planning Committee for
authority to accept up to 1,750 tons per day of out-of-state
waste at its landfill. See Bill Kettlewell Excavating, Inc. v.
Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, 732 F. Supp. 761, 762
(ED Mich. 1990). In that application petitioner promised toreserve sufficient capacity to dispose of all solid waste generated in the county in the next 20 years. The planning com-mittee denied the application.

Ibid. In view of the fact
that the county's management plan does not authorize the
acceptance of any out-of-county waste, the Waste Import Re-strictions in the 1988 statute effectively prevent petitioner

from receiving any solid waste that does not originate in St.Clair County.

Petitioner therefore commenced this action seeking ajudgment declaring the Waste Import Restrictions unconstitutional and enjoining their enforcement. Petitioner con-tended that requiring a private landfill operator to limit its
business to the acceptance of local waste constituted impermissible discrimination against interstate commerce. TheDistrict Court denied petitioner's motion for summary judgment, however, id., at 766, and subsequently dismissed thecomplaint, App. 4. The court first concluded that the statute

does not discriminate against interstate commerce "on itsface" because the import restrictions apply "equally to Michigan counties outside of the county adopting the plan as wellas to out-of-state entities." 732 F. Supp., at 764. It also
concluded that there was no discrimination "in practical ef-fect" because each county was given discretion to accept outof-state waste. Ibid. Moreover, the incidental effect oninterstate commerce was "not clearly excessive in relation
to the [public health and environmental] benefits derived byMichigan from the statute."

Id., at 765.The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit agreed with

the District Court's analysis. Although it recognized thatthe statute "places in-county and out-of-county waste in separate categories," the Court of Appeals found no discrimina-tion against interstate commerce because the statute "does
not treat out-of-county waste from Michigan any differentlythan waste from other states." 931 F. 2d, at 417. It also
agreed that there was no actual discrimination because peti-tioner had not alleged that all counties in Michigan ban outof-state waste. Id., at 418. Accordingly, it affirmed thejudgment of the District Court. Ibid. We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 1024 (1992), because of concern that the deci-sion below was inconsistent with Philadelphia v. New Jersey
and now reverse. II

Before discussing the rather narrow issue that is con-tested, it is appropriate to identify certain matters that are
not in dispute. Michigan's comprehensive program of regu-lating the collection, transportation, and disposal of solid
waste, as it was enacted in 1978 and administered prior tothe 1988 Waste Import Restrictions, is not challenged. No
issue relating to hazardous waste is presented, and there isno claim that petitioner's operation violated any health,
safety, or sanitation requirement. Nor does the case raiseany question concerning policies that municipalities or other
governmental agencies may pursue in the management of

Opinion of the Court
publicly owned facilities. The case involves only the validity
of the Waste Import Restrictions as they apply to privately
owned and operated landfills.

On the other hand, Philadelphia v. New Jersey provides
the framework for our analysis of this case. Solid waste,
even if it has no value, is an article of commerce.3 437 U. S.,
at 622-623. Whether the business arrangements between
out-of-state generators of waste and the Michigan operator
of a waste disposal site are viewed as "sales" of garbage or
"purchases" of transportation and disposal services, the commercial transactions unquestionably have an interstate character. The Commerce Clause thus imposes some constraints
on Michigan's ability to regulate these transactions.

As we have long recognized, the "negative" or "dormant"
aspect of the Commerce Clause prohibits States from
"advanc[ing] their own commercial interests by curtailing
the movement of articles of commerce, either into or out of
the state." H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U. S.
525, 535 (1949). A state statute that clearly discriminates
against interstate commerce is therefore unconstitutional
"unless the discrimination is demonstrably justified by a
valid factor unrelated to economic protectionism." New
Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 274 (1988).

3 As we explained in Philadelphia v. New Jersey:
"All objects of interstate trade merit Commerce Clause protection; none
is excluded by definition at the outset. In Bowman [v. Chicago & Northwestern R. Co., 125 U. S. 465 (1888),] and similar cases, the Court held
simply that because the articles' worth in interstate commerce was far
outweighed by the dangers inhering in their very movement, States could
prohibit their transportation across state lines. Hence, we reject the
state court's suggestion that the banning of `valueless' out-of-state wastes
by ch. 363 implicates no constitutional protection. Just as Congress has
power to regulate the interstate movement of these wastes, States are not
free from constitutional scrutiny when they restrict that movement. Cf.
Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794, 802-814; Meat Drivers
v. United States, 371 U. S. 94." 437 U. S., at 622-623.

360 FORT GRATIOT SANITARY LANDFILL, INC. v.

MICHIGAN DEPT. OF NATURAL RESOURCES

Opinion of the Court

New Jersey's prohibition on the importation of solid waste
failed this test:

"[T]he evil of protectionism can reside in legislative
means as well as legislative ends. Thus, it does not
matter whether the ultimate aim of ch. 363 is to reduce
the waste disposal costs of New Jersey residents or to
save remaining open lands from pollution, for we assume
New Jersey has every right to protect its residents'
pocketbooks as well as their environment. And it may
be assumed as well that New Jersey may pursue those
ends by slowing the flow of all waste into the State's
remaining landfills, even though interstate commerce
may incidentally be affected. But whatever New Jersey's ultimate purpose, it may not be accompanied by
discriminating against articles of commerce coming from
outside the State unless there is some reason, apart from
their origin, to treat them differently. Both on its face
and in its plain effect, ch. 363 violates this principle of
nondiscrimination.

"The Court has consistently found parochial legislation of this kind to be constitutionally invalid, whether
the ultimate aim of the legislation was to assure a steady
supply of milk by erecting barriers to allegedly ruinous
outside competition, Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294
U. S., at 522-524; or to create jobs by keeping industry within the State, Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v.
Haydel, 278 U. S. 1, 10; Johnson v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 16;
Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S., at 403-404; or to preserve
the State's financial resources from depletion by fencing out indigent immigrants, Edwards v. California, 314
U. S. 160, 173-174. In each of these cases, a presumably
legitimate goal was sought to be achieved by the illegitimate means of isolating the State from the national
economy." Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S., at

626-627.

361Cite as: 504 U. S. 353 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
The Waste Import Restrictions enacted by Michigan authorize each of the State's 83 counties to isolate itself from
the national economy. Indeed, unless a county acts affirmatively to permit other waste to enter its jurisdiction, the
statute affords local waste producers complete protection
from competition from out-of-state waste producers who
seek to use local waste disposal areas. In view of the fact
that Michigan has not identified any reason, apart from its
origin, why solid waste coming from outside the county
should be treated differently from solid waste within the
county, the foregoing reasoning would appear to control the
disposition of this case.

III

Respondents Michigan and St. Clair County argue, however, that the Waste Import Restrictions--unlike the New
Jersey prohibition on the importation of solid waste--do not
discriminate against interstate commerce on their face or in
effect because they treat waste from other Michigan counties
no differently than waste from other States. Instead, respondents maintain, the statute regulates evenhandedly to
effectuate local interests and should be upheld because the
burden on interstate commerce is not clearly excessive in
relation to the local benefits. Cf. Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.,
397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970). We disagree, for our prior cases
teach that a State (or one of its political subdivisions) may
not avoid the strictures of the Commerce Clause by curtailing the movement of articles of commerce through subdivisions of the State, rather than through the State itself.

In Brimmer v. Rebman, 138 U. S. 78 (1891), we reviewed
the constitutionality of a Virginia statute that imposed special inspection fees on meat from animals that had been
slaughtered more than 100 miles from the place of sale. We
concluded that the statute violated the Commerce Clause
even though it burdened Virginia producers as well as the
Illinois litigant before the Court. We explained:

362 FORT GRATIOT SANITARY LANDFILL, INC. v.

MICHIGAN DEPT. OF NATURAL RESOURCES

Opinion of the Court

"[T]his statute [cannot] be brought into harmony withthe Constitution by the circumstance that it purports to

apply alike to the citizens of all the States, includingVirginia; for, `a burden imposed by a State upon interstate commerce is not to be sustained simply becausethe statute imposing it applies alike to the people of all
the States, including the people of the State enactingsuch statute.'

Minnesota v. Barber, [136 U. S. 313(1890)]; Robbins v. Shelby Taxing District, 120 U. S. 489,

497. If the object of Virginia had been to obstruct thebringing into that State, for use as human food, of all
beef, veal and mutton, however wholesome, from ani-mals slaughtered in distant States, that object will be
accomplished if the statute before us be enforced." Id.,at 82-83.

In Dean Milk Co. v. Madison, 340 U. S. 349 (1951), anotherIllinois litigant challenged a city ordinance that made it
unlawful to sell any milk as pasteurized unless it had beenprocessed at a plant "within a radius of five miles from the
central square of Madison," id., at 350. We held the ordi-nance invalid, explaining:

"[T]his regulation, like the provision invalidated in
Baldwin v. Seelig, Inc., [294 U. S. 511 (1935)], in practi-cal effect excludes from distribution in Madison wholesome milk produced and pasteurized in Illinois. `Theimporter . . . may keep his milk or drink it, but sell it
he may not.' Id., at 521. In thus erecting an economicbarrier protecting a major local industry against competition from without the State, Madison plainly discrimi-nates against interstate commerce."

Id., at 354.

The fact that the ordinance also discriminated against allWisconsin producers whose facilities were more than five

miles from the center of the city did not mitigate its burdenon interstate commerce. As we noted, it was "immaterial
that Wisconsin milk from outside the Madison area is sub504us1$79I 04-04-96 22:50:17 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
jected to the same proscription as that moving in interstatecommerce." Id., at 354, n. 4.

Nor does the fact that the Michigan statute allows individ-ual counties to accept solid waste from out of state qualify
its discriminatory character. In the New Jersey case thestatute authorized a state agency to promulgate regulations
permitting certain categories of waste to enter the State.See 437 U. S., at 618-619. The limited exception covered by
those regulations--like the fact that several Michigan coun-ties accept out-of-state waste--merely reduced the scope of
the discrimination; for all categories of waste not exceptedby the regulations, the discriminatory ban remained in place.
Similarly, in this case St. Clair County's total ban on out-of-state waste is unaffected by the fact that some other counties
have adopted a different policy.4In short, neither the fact that the Michigan statute purports to regulate intercounty commerce in waste nor the factthat some Michigan counties accept out-of-state waste provides an adequate basis for distinguishing this case fromPhiladelphia v. New Jersey.

IV
Michigan and St. Clair County also argue that this caseis different from Philadelphia v. New Jersey because the

SWMA constitutes a comprehensive health and safety regu-lation rather than "economic protectionism" of the State's
limited landfill capacity. Relying on an excerpt from ouropinion in

Sporhase v. Nebraska ex rel. Douglas, 458 U. S.

that "expressly reserves a segment of the Oklahoma coal market for
Oklahoma-mined coal, to the exclusion of . . . other States," violates the
Commerce Clause even though it "sets aside only a `small portion' of the
Oklahoma coal market . . . . The volume of commerce affected measures
only the extent of the discrimination; it is of no relevance to the determination whether a State has discriminated against interstate commerce") (emphasis in original).

Opinion of the Court

941 (1982), they contend that the differential treatment of
out-of-state waste is reasonable because they have taken
measures to conserve their landfill capacity and the SWMA
is necessary to protect the health of their citizens. That reliance is misplaced. In the Sporhase case we considered the
constitutionality of a Nebraska statute that prohibited the
withdrawal of ground water for use in an adjoining State
without a permit that could only issue if four conditions were
satisfied.5 We held that the fourth condition--a requirement that the adjoining State grant reciprocal rights to withdraw its water and allow its use in Nebraska--violated the
Commerce Clause. Id., at 957-958.

As a preface to that holding, we identified several reasons
that, in combination, justified the conclusion that the other
conditions were facially valid. Id., at 957. First, we questioned whether the statute actually discriminated against interstate commerce. Although the restrictive conditions in
the statute nominally applied only to interstate transfers of
ground water, they might have been "no more strict in application than [other state-law] limitations upon intrastate
transfers." Id., at 956. "Obviously, a State that imposes
severe withdrawal and use restrictions on its own citizens
is not discriminating against interstate commerce when it

5 The statute at issue in Sporhase v. Nebraska ex rel. Douglas provided:
" `Any person, firm, city, village, municipal corporation or any other entity
intending to withdraw ground water from any well or pit located in the
State of Nebraska and transport it for use in an adjoining state shall apply
to the Department of Water Resources for a permit to do so. If the Director of Water Resources finds that the withdrawal of the ground water
requested is reasonable, is not contrary to the conservation and use of
ground water, and is not otherwise detrimental to the public welfare, he
shall grant the permit if the state in which the water is to be used grants
reciprocal rights to withdraw and transport ground water from that state
for use in the State of Nebraska.' " 458 U. S., at 944 (quoting Neb. Rev.
Stat. $ 46-613.01 (1978)).

Opinion of the Court
seeks to prevent the uncontrolled transfer of water out of
the State." Id., at 955-956.

We further explained that a confluence of factors could justify a State's efforts to conserve and preserve ground water
for its own citizens in times of severe shortage.6 Only the
first of those reasons--our reference to the well-recognized

6 "Moreover, in the absence of a contrary view expressed by Congress,
we are reluctant to condemn as unreasonable, measures taken by a State
to conserve and preserve for its own citizens this vital resource in times
of severe shortage. Our reluctance stems from the `confluence of [several]
realities.' Hicklin v. Orbeck, 437 U. S. 518, 534 (1978). First, a State's
power to regulate the use of water in times and places of shortage for the
purpose of protecting the health of its citizens--and not simply the health
of its economy--is at the core of its police power. For Commerce Clause
purposes, we have long recognized a difference between economic protectionism, on the one hand, and health and safety regulation, on the other.
See H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U. S. 525, 533 (1949). Second, the legal expectation that under certain circumstances each State
may restrict water within its borders has been fostered over the years
not only by our equitable apportionment decrees, see, e. g., Wyoming v.
Colorado, 353 U. S. 953 (1957), but also by the negotiation and enforcement
of interstate compacts. Our law therefore has recognized the relevance
of state boundaries in the allocation of scarce water resources. Third,
although appellee's claim to public ownership of Nebraska ground water
cannot justify a total denial of federal regulatory power, it may support a
limited preference for its own citizens in the utilization of the resource.
See Hicklin v. Orbeck, supra, at 533-534. In this regard, it is relevant
that appellee's claim is logically more substantial than claims to public
ownership of other natural resources. See supra, at 950-951. Finally,
given appellee's conservation efforts, the continuing availability of ground
water in Nebraska is not simply happenstance; the natural resource has
some indicia of a good publicly produced and owned in which a State may
favor its own citizens in times of shortage. See Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447
U. S. 429 (1980); cf. Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S., at 627-628, and
n. 6; Baldwin v. Fish and Game Comm'n of Montana, 436 U. S. 371 (1978).

A facial examination of the first three conditions set forth in $ 46-613.01
does not, therefore, indicate that they impermissibly burden interstate
commerce. Appellants, indeed, seem to concede their reasonableness."

Opinion of the Court

difference between economic protectionism, on the one hand,
and health and safety regulation, on the other--is even arguably relevant to this case.7 We may assume that all of the
provisions of Michigan's SWMA prior to the 1988 amendments adding the Waste Import Restrictions could fairly be
characterized as health and safety regulations with no
protectionist purpose, but we cannot make that same assumption with respect to the Waste Import Restrictions
themselves. Because those provisions unambiguously discriminate against interstate commerce, the State bears the
burden of proving that they further health and safety concerns that cannot be adequately served by nondiscriminatory
alternatives. Michigan and St. Clair County have not met
this burden.8

Michigan and St. Clair County assert that the Waste Import Restrictions are necessary because they enable individual counties to make adequate plans for the safe disposal of
future waste.9 Although accurate forecasts about the vol7 The other reasons were related to the special role that States have
traditionally played in the ownership and control of ground water and to
the fact that Nebraska's conservation efforts had given the water some
indicia of a good that is publicly produced and owned. See id., at 956.
There are, however, no analogous traditional legal expectations regarding
state regulation of private landfills, which are neither publicly produced
nor publicly owned.

8 The dissent states that we should remand for further proceedings in

which Michigan and St. Clair County might be able to prove that the
Waste Import Restrictions constitute legitimate health and safety regulations, rather than economic protectionism of the State's limited landfill
capacity. See post, at 368, 371. We disagree, for respondents have neither asked for such a remand nor suggested that, if given the opportunity,
they could prove that the restrictions further health and safety concerns
that cannot adequately be served by nondiscriminatory alternatives.

9 "An unregulated free market flow of waste into Michigan," the State

asserts, "would be disruptive of efforts to plan for the proper disposal of
future waste due to incoming waste from sources not accounted for during
the planning process." Brief for State Respondents 49; see also Brief for
County Respondents 13.

Opinion of the Court
ume and composition of future waste flows may be anindispensable part of a comprehensive waste disposal plan,

Michigan could attain that objective without discriminatingbetween in- and out-of-state waste. Michigan could, for
example, limit the amount of waste that landfill operators
may accept each year. See Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437U. S., at 626. There is, however, no valid health and safety

reason for limiting the amount of waste that a landfill opera-tor may accept from outside the State, but not the amount
that the operator may accept from inside the State.Of course, our conclusion would be different if the imported waste raised health or other concerns not presentedby Michigan waste. In

Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131 (1986),
for example, we upheld the State's prohibition against the
importation of live baitfish because parasites and other char-acteristics of nonnative species posed a serious threat to native fish that could not be avoided by available inspectiontechniques. We concluded:

"The evidence in this case amply supports the DistrictCourt's findings that Maine's ban on the importation of
live baitfish serves legitimate local purposes that couldnot adequately be served by available nondiscriminatory
alternatives. This is not a case of arbitrary discrimina-tion against interstate commerce; the record suggests
that Maine has legitimate reasons, `apart from their ori-gin, to treat [out-of-state baitfish] differently,'

Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S., at 627." Id., at 151-152.

In this case, in contrast, the lower courts did not find--and
respondents have not provided--any legitimate reason for
allowing petitioner to accept waste from inside the county
but not waste from outside the county.

For the foregoing reasons, the Waste Import Restrictions
unambiguously discriminate against interstate commerce
and are appropriately characterized as protectionist measures that cannot withstand scrutiny under the Commerce

Clause. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is thereforereversed.

It is so ordered.
Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Blackmun joins, dissenting.

When confronted with a dormant Commerce Clause challenge "[t]he crucial inquiry . . . must be directed to determin-ing whether [the challenged statute] is basically a protectionist measure, or whether it can fairly be viewed as a lawdirected to legitimate local concerns, with effects upon interstate commerce that are only incidental." Philadelphia v.
New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 624 (1978). Because I think the
Michigan statute is at least arguably directed to legitimatelocal concerns, rather than improper economic protectionism,

I would remand this case for further proceedings.

The substantial environmental, esthetic, health, and safety
problems flowing from this country's waste piles were already apparent at the time we decided Philadelphia. Those
problems have only risen in the intervening years. Salisbury, Pollution Liability Insurance Coverage, The StandardForm Pollution Exclusion, and the Insurance Industry: A
Case Study in Collective Amnesia, 21 Envtl. L. 357, 369-370
(1991). In part this is due to increased waste volumes,
volumes that are expected to continue rising for the foreseeable future. See United States Environmental Protection
Agency, Characterization of Municipal Solid Waste in the
United States: 1990 Update 10 (municipal solid wastes have
increased from 128.1 million tons in 1975 to 179.6 million tons

id., at ES-3 (1988 waste was the equivalent of 4.0 pounds
per person per day, expected to rise to 4.4 pounds per person
by the year 2000). In part it is due to exhaustion of existing
capacity. Id., at 55 (landfill disposals increased from 99.7

capacity by 1991). It is no secret why capacity is not ex-panding sufficiently to meet demand--the substantial risks

attendant to waste sites make them extraordinarily unat-tractive neighbors.

Swin Resource Systems, Inc. v. Lycoming Cty., 883 F. 2d 245, 253 (CA3 1989), cert. denied, 493 U. S.
1077 (1990). The result, of course, is that while many arewilling to generate waste--indeed, it is a practical impossibility to solve the waste problem by banning waste produc-tion--few are willing to help dispose of it. Those locales
that do provide disposal capacity to serve foreign waste ef-fectively are affording reduced environmental and safety
risks to the States that will not take charge of their ownwaste.*

The State of Michigan has stepped into this quagmire in
order to address waste problems generated by its own popu-lace. It has done so by adopting a comprehensive approach

to the disposal of solid wastes generated within its borders.

*I am baffled by the Court's suggestion that this case might be characterized as one in which garbage is being bought and sold. See ante, at
359. There is no suggestion that petitioner is making payment in order
to have garbage delivered to it. Petitioner is, instead, being paid to accept the garbage of which others wish to be rid. There can be little doubt
that in accepting this garbage, petitioner is also imposing environmental
and other risks attendant to the waste's delivery and storage.

thus quite unlike the simple outright ban that we confrontedin

Philadelphia.
In adopting this legislation, the Michigan Legislature alsoappears to have concluded that, like the State, counties

should reap as they have sown--hardly a novel proposition.
It has required counties within the State to be responsiblefor the waste created within the county. It has accomplished this by prohibiting waste facilities from acceptingwaste generated from outside the county, unless special permits are obtained. In the process, of course, this faciallyneutral restriction (

i. e., it applies equally to both interstate
and intrastate waste) also works to ban disposal from out-ofstate sources unless appropriate permits are procured. But
I cannot agree that such a requirement, when imposed as
one part of a comprehensive approach to regulating in this
difficult field, is the stuff of which economic protectionism
is made.

If anything, the challenged regulation seems likely to work
to Michigan's economic disadvantage. This is because, by
limiting potential disposal volumes for any particular site,
various fixed costs will have to be recovered across smaller
volumes, increasing disposal costs per unit for Michigan consumers. 56 Fed. Reg. 50987 (1991). The regulation also
will require some Michigan counties--those that until now
have been exporting their waste to other locations in the
State--to confront environmental and other risks that they
previously have avoided. Commerce Clause concerns are at
their nadir when a state Act works in this fashion--raising
prices for all the State's consumers, and working to the
substantial disadvantage of other segments of the State's
population--because in these circumstances " `a State's own
political processes will serve as a check against unduly
burdensome regulations.' " Kassel v. Consolidated Freightways Corp. of Del., 450 U. S. 662, 675 (1981) (quoting Raymond Motor Transportation, Inc. v. Rice, 434 U. S. 429, 444,

monsense notion that those responsible for a problem should
be responsible for its solution to the degree they are responsible for the problem but not further. At a minimum, I think
the facts just outlined suggest the State must be allowed to
present evidence on the economic, environmental, and other
effects of its legislation.

The Court suggests that our decisions in Brimmer v. Rebman, 138 U. S. 78 (1891), and Dean Milk Co. v. Madison,
340 U. S. 349 (1951), foreclose the possibility that a statute
attacked on Commerce Clause grounds may be defended by
pointing to the statute's effects on intrastate commerce.
But our decisions in those cases did not rest on such a broad
proposition. Instead, as the passages quoted by the Court
make clear, in both Brimmer and Dean Milk the Court simply rejected the notion that there could be a noneconomic
protectionist reason for the bans at issue, because the objects
being banned presented no health or environmental risk.
See Brimmer, 138 U. S., at 83 ("[i]f the object of Virginia had
been to obstruct the bringing into that State, for uses as
human food, of all beef, veal and mutton, however wholesome" (emphasis added)); see also ibid. (comparing the statute to one that bans meat from other States "in whatever
form, and although entirely sound and fit for human food"
(emphasis added)); Dean Milk, 340 U. S., at 354 (the statute
"excludes from distribution in Madison wholesome milk"
(emphasis added)). It seems unlikely that the waste here is
"wholesome" or "entirely sound and fit." It appears, instead, to be potentially dangerous--at least the State has so
concluded. Nor does the legislation appear to protect "a
major local industry against competition from without the
State." Ibid. Neither Dean Milk nor Brimmer prohibits
a State from adopting health and safety regulations that are
directed to legitimate local concerns. See Maine v. Taylor,
477 U. S. 131 (1986). I would remand this case to give the
State an opportunity to show that this is such a regulation.

MICHIGAN DEPT. OF NATURAL RESOURCES

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting

We confirmed in Sporhase v. Nebraska ex rel. Douglas, 458U. S. 941 (1982), that a State's effort to adopt a comprehensive regime to address a major environmental threat orthreat to natural resources need not run afoul of the Commerce Clause. In that case we noted that "[o]bviously, a
State that imposes severe withdrawal and use restrictionson its own citizens is not discriminating against interstate

commerce when it seeks to prevent the uncontrolled transferof water out of the State."

Id., at 955-956. Substitute "attractive and safe environment" for "water" and one has thepresent case. Michigan has limited the ability of its own

population to despoil the environment and to create health
and safety risks by excessive and uncontrolled waste disposal. It does not thereby violate the Commerce Clause
when it seeks to prevent this resource from being exported--the effect if Michigan is forced to accept foreign
waste in its disposal facilities. Rather, the "resource has
some indicia of a good publicly produced and owned in which
a State may favor its own citizens in times of shortage." Id.,
at 957. Of course the State may choose not to do this, and
in fact, in this case Michigan does permit counties to decide
on an individualized basis whether to accept out-of-county
waste. But such a result is not constitutionally mandated.

The modern landfill is a technically complex engineering
exercise that comes replete with liners, leachate collection
systems, and highly regulated operating conditions. As a
result, siting a modern landfill can now proceed largely independent of the landfill location's particular geological characteristics. See 56 Fed. Reg. 51009 (1991) (Environmental
Protection Agency approved "composite liner system is designed to be protective in all locations, including poor locations"); id., at 51004-51005 (outlining additional technical requirements for only those landfill sites (1) near airports, (2)
on floodplains, (3) on wetlands, (4) on fault areas, (5) on seismic impact zones, or (6) on unstable areas). Given this, the
laws of economics suggest that landfills will sprout in places

where land is cheapest and population densities least. SeeAlm, "Not in My Backyard:" Facing the Siting Question, 10

EPA J. 9 (1984) (noting the need for each county to accept ashare of the overall waste stream equivalent to what it generates so that "less populated counties are protected againstbecoming the dumping ground of the entire region"). I see
no reason in the Commerce Clause, however, that requirescheap-land States to become the waste repositories for their
brethren, thereby suffering the many risks that such sitespresent.

The Court today penalizes the State of Michigan for whatto all appearances are its good-faith efforts, in turn encouraging each State to ignore the waste problem in the hope thatanother will pick up the slack. The Court's approach fails
to recognize that the latter option is one that is quite realand quite attractive for many States--and becomes even
more so when the intermediate option of solving its ownproblems, but only its own problems, is eliminated.

For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.

MORALES, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF TEXAS v.TRANS WORLD AIRLINES, INC.,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 90-1604. Argued March 3, 1992--Decided June 1, 1992
In order to ensure that the States would not undo the anticipated benefits

of federal deregulation of the airline industry, the pre-emption provision
of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA) prohibits them from enforcing any law "relating to [air carriers'] rates, routes, or services." 49
U. S. C. App. $ 1305(a)(1). After the National Association of Attorneys
General (NAAG) adopted guidelines that contain detailed standards
governing, inter alia, the content and format of airline fare advertising,
and that purport to be enforceable through the States' general consumer
protection statutes, petitioner's predecessor as Attorney General of
Texas sent notices of intent to sue to enforce the guidelines against the
allegedly deceptive fare advertisements of several of the respondent
airlines. Those respondents filed suit in the District Court for injunctive and other relief, claiming that state regulation of fare advertisements is pre-empted by $ 1305(a)(1). The court ultimately issued an
order permanently enjoining any state enforcement action that would
regulate or restrict "any aspect" of respondents' fare advertising or
other operations involving rates, routes, or services. The Court of
Appeals affirmed.

Held:

1. Assuming that $ 1305(a)(1) pre-empts state enforcement of the fare
advertising portions of the NAAG guidelines, the District Court could
properly award respondents injunctive relief restraining such enforcement. The basic doctrine that equity courts should not act when the
moving party has an adequate remedy at law does not prevent federal
courts from enjoining state officers from acting to enforce an unconstitutional state law where, as here, such action is imminent, repetitive penalties attach to continuing or repeated violations of the law, and the
moving party lacks the realistic option of violating the law once and
raising its federal defenses. Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, 145-147,
156, 163-165. As petitioner has threatened to enforce only the obligations described in the fare advertising portions of the guidelines, however, the injunction must be vacated insofar as it restrains the operation
of state laws with respect to other matters. See, e. g., Public Serv.
Comm'n of Utah v. Wycoff Co., 344 U. S. 237, 240-241. Pp. 380-383.

2. Enforcement of the NAAG fare advertising guidelines through a
State's general consumer protection laws is pre-empted by the ADA.
Pp. 383-391.

(a) In light of the breadth of $ 1305(a)(1)'s "relating to" phrase, a
state enforcement action is pre-empted if it has a connection with, or
reference to, airline "rates, routes, or services." Cf. Shaw v. Delta Air
Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85, 95-96. Petitioner's various objections to this
reading are strained and not well taken. Pp. 383-387.

(b) The challenged NAAG guidelines--which require, inter alia,
that advertisements contain certain disclosures as to fare terms, restrictions, and availability--obviously "relat[e] to rates" within the meaning
of $ 1305(a)(1) and are therefore pre-empted. Each guideline bears an
express reference to airfares, and, collectively, they establish binding
requirements as to how tickets may be marketed if they are to be sold
at given prices. In any event, beyond the guidelines' express reference
to fares, it is clear as an economic matter that they would have the
forbidden effect upon fares: Their compelled disclosures and advertising
restrictions would have a significant impact on the airlines' ability to
market their product, and hence a significant impact upon the fares they
charge. Pp. 387-391.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
The issue in this case is whether the Airline DeregulationAct of 1978, 49 U. S. C. App. $ 1301

et seq., pre-empts theStates from prohibiting allegedly deceptive airline fare advertisements through enforcement of their general consumerprotection statutes.

I
Prior to 1978, the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (FAA), 72Stat. 731, as amended, 49 U. S. C. App. $ 1301

et seq., gavethe Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) authority to regulate interstate airfares and to take administrative action againstcertain deceptive trade practices. It did not, however, expressly pre-empt state regulation, and contained a "savingclause" providing that "[n]othing . . . in this chapter shall in
any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at com-mon law or by statute, but the provisions of this chapter are
in addition to such remedies." 49 U. S. C. App. $ 1506. Asa result, the States were able to regulate intrastate airfares
(including those offered by interstate air carriers), see, e. g.,California v. CAB, 189 U. S. App. D. C. 176, 178, 581 F. 2d
954, 956 (1978), cert. denied, 439 U. S. 1068 (1979), and toenforce their own laws against deceptive trade practices, see
Nader v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc., 426 U. S. 290, 300 (1976).In 1978, however, Congress, determining that "maximum
reliance on competitive market forces" would best further"efficiency, innovation, and low prices" as well as "variety
[and] quality . . . of air transportation services," enactedthe Airline Deregulation Act (ADA). 49 U. S. C. App.

$$ 1302(a)(4), 1302(a)(9). To ensure that the States wouldnot undo federal deregulation with regulation of their own,
the ADA included a pre-emption provision, prohibiting theStates from enforcing any law "relating to rates, routes, or

Opinion of the Court
services" of any air carrier. $ 1305(a)(1). The ADA re-tained the CAB's previous enforcement authority regarding

deceptive trade practices (which was transferred to the De-partment of Transportation (DOT) when the CAB was abolished in 1985), and it also did not repeal or alter the saving
clause in the prior law.In 1987, the National Association of Attorneys General

(NAAG), an organization whose membership includes the at-torneys general of all 50 States, various Territories, and the
District of Columbia, adopted Air Travel Industry Enforce-ment Guidelines (set forth in an Appendix to this opinion)
containing detailed standards governing the content and format of airline advertising, the awarding of premiums to regular customers (so-called "frequent flyers"), and the payment
of compensation to passengers who voluntarily yield their
seats on overbooked flights. These guidelines do not purport to "create any new laws or regulations" applying to the
airline industry; rather, they claim to "explain in detail how
existing state laws apply to air fare advertising and frequent
flyer programs." NAAG Guidelines, Introduction (1988).

Despite objections to the guidelines by the DOT and the
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on pre-emption and policy
grounds, the attorneys general of seven States, including
petitioner's predecessor as attorney general of Texas, sent a
memorandum to the major airlines announcing that "it has
come to our attention that although most airlines are making
a concerted effort to bring their advertisements into compliance with the standards delineated in the . . . guidelines for
fare advertising, many carriers are still [not disclosing all
surcharges]" in violation of $ 2.5 of the guidelines. The
memorandum said it was the signatories' "purpose . . . to
clarify for the industry as a whole that [this practice] is a
violation of our respective state laws on deceptive advertising and trade practices"; warned that this was an "advisory
memorandum before [the] initiati[on of] any immediate enforcement actions"; and expressed the hope that "protracted

litigation over this issue will not be necessary and thatairlines will discontinue the practice . . . immediately."

Memorandum from Attorneys General of Colorado, Kansas,Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, Texas, and Wisconsin,
dated February 3, 1988 (Exhibit A to Exhibit H to Motionfor Temporary Restraining Order), App. 123a, 125a. Several months later, petitioner's office sent letters to severalrespondents serving "as formal notice[s] of intent to sue."
Letter from Assistant Attorney General of Texas, dated No-vember 14, 1988, App. 115a.

Those respondents then filed suit in Federal District Courtclaiming that state regulation of fare advertisements is preempted by $ 1305(a)(1); seeking a declaratory judgment that,inter alia, $ 2.5 of the guidelines is pre-empted; and requesting an injunction restraining Texas from taking any actionunder its law in conjunction with the guidelines that would
regulate respondents' rates, routes, or services, or their ad-vertising and marketing of the same. The District Court
entered a preliminary injunction to that effect, determiningthat respondents were likely to prevail on their pre-emption
claim. Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Mattox, 712 F. Supp.99, 101-102 (WD Tex. 1989). (It subsequently extended that
injunction to 33 other States, id., at 105-106; the proprietyof that extension is not before us.) The Court of Appeals
affirmed. Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Mattox, 897 F. 2d773, 783-784 (CA5 1990). Subsequently, the District Court,
in an unreported order, permanently enjoined the Statesfrom taking "any enforcement action" which would restrict
"any aspect" of respondents' fare advertising or operationsrelating to rates, routes, or services. The Court of Appeals
once again affirmed. 949 F. 2d 141 (CA5 1991). We grantedcertiorari. 502 U. S. 976 (1991).

Before discussing whether $ 1305(a)(1) pre-empts stateenforcement of the challenged guidelines, we first consider

381Cite as: 504 U. S. 374 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
whether, assuming that it does, the District Court couldproperly award respondents injunctive relief. It is a " `basic

doctrine of equity jurisprudence that courts of equity shouldnot act . . . when the moving party has an adequate remedy
at law and will not suffer irreparable injury if denied equita-ble relief.' "

O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U. S. 488, 499 (1974);Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, 43-44 (1971). In Ex parte

Young, 209 U. S. 123, 156 (1908), we held that this doctrinedoes not prevent federal courts from enjoining state officers
"who threaten and are about to commence proceedings,either of a civil or criminal nature, to enforce against parties
affected an unconstitutional act, violating the Federal Con-stitution." When enforcement actions are imminent--and
at least when repetitive penalties attach to continuing orrepeated violations and the moving party lacks the realistic option of violating the law once and raising its federaldefenses--there is no adequate remedy at law. See

id., at145-147, 163-165.

We think Young establishes that injunctive relief wasavailable here. As we have described, the attorneys general
of seven States, including petitioner's predecessor, had madeclear that they would seek to enforce the challenged portions
of the guidelines (those concerning fare advertising) throughsuits under their respective state laws. And Texas law,
at least, imposes additional liability (by way of civil penal-ties and consumer treble-damages actions) for multiple violations. See Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. $$ 17.47, 17.50 (1987and Supp. 1991-1992). Like the plaintiff in Young, then, respondents were faced with a Hobson's choice: continually vio-late the Texas law and expose themselves to potentially huge
liability; or violate the law once as a test case and sufferthe injury of obeying the law during the pendency of the
proceedings and any further review.1

1 We do not address whether the District Court should have abstained
from entertaining this suit under the line of cases commencing with
Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971), which imposes heightened require504us1$u80 04-23-96 09:41:06 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
The District Court, however, enjoined petitioner not onlyfrom enforcing the fare advertising sections of the guidelines, but also from "initiating any enforcement action . . .which would seek to regulate or restrict any aspect of the
. . . plaintiff airlines' air fare advertising or the operationsinvolving their rates, routes, and/or services." 712 F. Supp.,
at 102. In so doing, it disregarded the limits on the exerciseof its injunctive power. In suits such as this one, which the
plaintiff intends as a "first strike" to prevent a State frominitiating a suit of its own, the prospect of state suit must be
imminent, for it is the prospect of that suit which suppliesthe necessary irreparable injury. See

Public Serv. Comm'n
of Utah v. Wycoff Co., 344 U. S. 237, 240-241 (1952). Exparte Young thus speaks of enjoining state officers "who

threaten and are about to commence proceedings," 209 U. S.,at 156 (emphasis added); see also id., at 158, and we have
recognized in a related context that a conjectural injury can-not warrant equitable relief, see O'Shea, supra, at 502. Any
other rule (assuming it would meet Article III case-or-controversy requirements) would require federal courts to
determine the constitutionality of state laws in hypotheticalsituations where it is not even clear the State itself would
consider its law applicable. This problem is vividly enoughillustrated by the blunderbuss injunction in the present case,
which declares pre-empted "any" state suit involving "anyaspect" of the airlines' rates, routes, and services. As
petitioner has threatened to enforce only the obligationsdescribed in the guidelines regarding fare advertising, the

ments for an injunction to restrain an already-pending or an about-to-bepending state criminal action, or civil action involving important state
interests, see generally Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State
Bar Assn., 457 U. S. 423, 431-432, 437 (1982); Trainor v. Hernandez, 431
U. S. 434, 440-447 (1977); Younger, supra, at 43-49. Petitioner has not

argued for abstention, and the federal-state comity considerations underlying Younger are accordingly not implicated. See Brown v. Hotel
Employees, 468 U. S. 491, 500, n. 9 (1984); Ohio Bureau of Employment
Services v. Hodory, 431 U. S. 471, 480 (1977).

injunction must be vacated insofar as it restrains the opera-tion of state laws with respect to other matters.

III
We now turn to the question whether enforcement of theNAAG guidelines on fare advertising through a State's general consumer protection laws is pre-empted by the ADA.As we have often observed, "[p]re-emption may be either
express or implied, and is compelled whether Congress' com-mand is explicitly stated in the statute's language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose." FMC Corp. v.
Holliday, 498 U. S. 52, 56-57 (1990) (internal quotationmarks omitted); Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85,

95 (1983). The question, at bottom, is one of statutory in-tent, and we accordingly " `begin with the language employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinarymeaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.' " Holliday, supra, at 57; Park 'N Fly, Inc. v.
Dollar Park & Fly, Inc., 469 U. S. 189, 194 (1985).

A
Section 1305(a)(1) expressly pre-empts the States from"enact[ing] or enforc[ing] any law, rule, regulation, standard,

or other provision having the force and effect of law relatingto rates, routes, or services of any air carrier . . . ." For
purposes of the present case, the key phrase, obviously, is"relating to." The ordinary meaning of these words is a
broad one--"to stand in some relation; to have bearing orconcern; to pertain; refer; to bring into association with or
connection with," Black's Law Dictionary 1158 (5th ed.1979)--and the words thus express a broad pre-emptive purpose. We have repeatedly recognized that in addressing thesimilarly worded pre-emption provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U. S. C.$ 1144(a), which pre-empts all state laws "insofar as they . . .
relate to any employee benefit plan." We have said, for ex504us1$u80 04-23-96 09:41:06 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ample, that the "breadth of [that provision's] pre-emptive
reach is apparent from [its] language," Shaw, supra, at 96;
that it has a "broad scope," Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.
Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 739 (1985), and an "expansive
sweep," Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 47
(1987); and that it is "broadly worded," Ingersoll-Rand Co.
v. McClendon, 498 U. S. 133, 138 (1990), "deliberately expansive," Pilot Life, supra, at 46, and "conspicuous for its
breadth," Holliday, supra, at 58. True to our word, we
have held that a state law "relates to" an employee benefit
plan, and is pre-empted by ERISA, "if it has a connection
with or reference to such a plan." Shaw, supra, at 97.
Since the relevant language of the ADA is identical, we think
it appropriate to adopt the same standard here: State enforcement actions having a connection with, or reference to,
airline "rates, routes, or services" are pre-empted under 49
U. S. C. App. $ 1305(a)(1).

Petitioner raises a number of objections to this reading,
none of which we think is well taken. First, he claims that
we may not use our interpretation of identical language in
ERISA as a guide, because the sweeping nature of ERISA
pre-emption derives not from the "relates to" language, but
from "the wide and inclusive sweep of the comprehensive
ERISA scheme," which he asserts the ADA does not have.
Brief for Petitioner 33-34. This argument is flatly contradicted by our ERISA cases, which clearly and unmistakably
rely on express pre-emption principles and a construction of
the phrase "relates to." See, e. g., Shaw, supra, at 96-97,
and n. 16 (citing dictionary definitions); Ingersoll-Rand,
supra, at 138-139. Petitioner also stresses that the FAA
"saving" clause, which preserves "the remedies now existing
at common law or by statute," 49 U. S. C. App. $ 1506, is
broader than its ERISA counterpart. But it is a commonplace of statutory construction that the specific governs the
general, see, e. g., Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc.,

Opinion of the Court
482 U. S. 437, 445 (1987), a canon particularly pertinent here,where the "saving" clause is a relic of the pre-ADA/no preemption regime. A general "remedies" saving clause cannotbe allowed to supersede the specific substantive pre-emption
provision--unless it be thought that a State having a statuterequiring "reasonable rates," and providing remedies against
"unreasonable" ones, could actually set airfares. As in International Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 479 U. S. 481, 494 (1987),"we do not believe Congress intended to undermine this

carefully drawn statute through a general saving clause."Petitioner contends that $ 1305(a)(1) only pre-empts the
States from actually prescribing rates, routes, or services.
This simply reads the words "relating to" out of the statute.Had the statute been designed to pre-empt state law in such

a limited fashion, it would have forbidden the States to "regulate rates, routes, and services." See Pilot Life, supra, at
50 ("A common-sense view of the word `regulates' would leadto the conclusion that in order to regulate [a matter], a law

. . . must be specifically directed toward [it]").2 Moreover,

2 The dissent believes petitioner's position on this point to be supported
by the history and structure of the ADA (sources it deems "more illuminating" than a "narrow focus" on the ADA's language, post, at 421), because the old regime did not pre-empt the state laws involved here and
the ADA's legislative history contains no statements specifically addressed
to state regulation of advertising. Post, at 421-426. Suffice it to say that
legislative history need not confirm the details of changes in the law effected by statutory language before we will interpret that language according to its natural meaning. See, e. g., Harrison v. PPG Industries,
Inc., 446 U. S. 578, 591-592 (1980).

It also bears mention that the rejected Senate bill did contain language
that would have produced precisely the result the dissent desires: "No
State shall enact any law . . . determining routes, schedules, or rates,
fares, or charges in tariffs of . . . ." S. 2493, $ 423(a)(1), reprinted
in S. Rep. No. 95-631, p. 39 (1978) (emphasis added). The dissent is
unperturbed by the full Congress' preference for "relating to" over "determining," because the Conference Report gave "no indication that the conferees thought the House's `relating to' language would have a broader

386 MORALES v. TRANS WORLD AIRLINES, INC.

Opinion of the Court
if the pre-emption effected by $ 1305(a)(1) were such a lim-ited one, no purpose would be served by the very next subsection, which preserves to the States certain proprietaryrights over airports. 49 U. S. C. App. $ 1305(b).

Next, petitioner advances the notion that only state laws
specifically addressed to the airline industry are pre-empted,whereas the ADA imposes no constraints on laws of general

applicability. Besides creating an utterly irrational loophole(there is little reason why state impairment of the federal
scheme should be deemed acceptable so long as it is effectedby the particularized application of a general statute), this
notion similarly ignores the sweep of the "relating to" lan-guage. We have consistently rejected this precise argument in our ERISA cases: "[A] state law may `relate to'
a benefit plan, and thereby be pre-empted, even if the lawis not specifically designed to affect such plans, or the

effect is only indirect." Ingersoll-Rand, supra, at 139;
see Pilot Life, supra, at 47-48 (common-law tort and contract suits pre-empted); Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at 739
(state law requiring health insurance plans to cover certain
mental health expenses pre-empted); Alessi v. RaybestosManhattan, Inc., 451 U. S. 504, 525 (1981) (workers' compensation laws pre-empted).

Last, the State suggests that pre-emption is inappropriate
when state and federal law are consistent. State and federal law are in fact inconsistent here--the DOT opposes the
obligations contained in the guidelines, and Texas law imposes greater liability--but that is beside the point. Nothing in the language of $ 1305(a)(1) suggests that its "relating

pre-emptive scope than the Senate's . . . language," post, at 426--which is
to say because the Conference Report failed to specify the completely
obvious, that "relating to" is broader than "determining." The dissent
evidently believes not only that plain statutory language cannot be credited unless specifically explained in legislative history, but also that the
apparent import of legislative history cannot be credited unless specifically
explained in legislative history.

to" pre-emption is limited to inconsistent state regulation;and once again our ERISA cases have settled the matter:

are consistent with ERISA's substantive requirements.' "

B
It is hardly surprising that petitioner rests most of hiscase on such strained readings of $ 1305(a)(1), rather than

contesting whether the NAAG guidelines really "relat[e] to"fares. They quite obviously do. Taking them seriatim:
Section 2.1, governing print advertisements of fares, re-quires "clear and conspicuous disclosure [defined as the
lesser of one-third the size of the largest typeface in the ador ten-point type] of restrictions such as" limited time availability, limitations on refund or exchange rights, time-of-dayor day-of-week restrictions, length-of-stay requirements,
advance-purchase and round-trip-purchase requirements,variations in fares from or to different airports in the same
metropolitan area, limitations on breaks or changes in itiner-ary, limits on fare availability, and "[a]ny other material restriction on the fare." Section 2.2 imposes similar, thoughsomewhat less onerous, restrictions on broadcast advertisements of fares; and $ 2.3 requires billboard fare ads to stateclearly and conspicuously " `Substantial restrictions apply' "
if there are any material restrictions on the fares' availabil-ity. The guidelines further mandate that an advertised fare
be available in sufficient quantities to "meet reasonably fore-seeable demand" on every flight on every day in every market in which the fare is advertised; if the fare will not beavailable on this basis, the ad must contain a "clear and conspicuous statement of the extent of unavailability." $ 2.4.Section 2.5 requires that the advertised fare include all taxes
and surcharges; round-trip fares, under $ 2.6, must be dis504us1$u80 04-23-96 09:41:07 PAGES OPINPGT
388 MORALES v. TRANS WORLD AIRLINES, INC.

Opinion of the Court
closed at least as prominently as the one-way fare when thefare is only available on round trips; and $ 2.7 prohibits use

of the words " `sale,' `discount,' [or] `reduced' " unless the ad-vertised fare is available only for a limited time and is "substantially below the usual price for the same fare with the
same restrictions."One cannot avoid the conclusion that these aspects of the

guidelines "relate to" airline rates. In its terms, every oneof the guidelines enumerated above bears a "reference to"
airfares. Shaw, 463 U. S., at 97. And, collectively, theguidelines establish binding requirements as to how tickets
may be marketed if they are to be sold at given prices.
Under Texas law, many violations of these requirements
would give consumers a cause of action (for at least actual
damages, see Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. $ 17.50 (1987 and
Supp. 1991-1992)) for an airline's failure to provide a particular advertised fare--effectively creating an enforceable right
to that fare when the advertisement fails to include the mandated explanations and disclaimers. This case therefore appears to us much like Pilot Life, in which we held that a
common-law tort and contract action seeking damages for
the failure of an employee benefit plan to pay benefits "relate[d] to" employee benefit plans and was pre-empted by
ERISA. 481 U. S., at 43-44, 47-48.

In any event, beyond the guidelines' express reference to
fares, it is clear as an economic matter that state restrictions
on fare advertising have the forbidden significant effect upon
fares. Advertising "serves to inform the public of the . . .
prices of products and services, and thus performs an indispensable role in the allocation of resources." Bates v. State
Bar of Arizona, 433 U. S. 350, 364 (1977). Restrictions on
advertising "serv[e] to increase the difficulty of discovering
the lowest cost seller . . . and [reduce] the incentive to price
competitively." Id., at 377. Accordingly, "where consumers have the benefit of price advertising, retail prices often
are dramatically lower than they would be without advertis504us1$u80 04-23-96 09:41:07 PAGES OPINPGT

389Cite as: 504 U. S. 374 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
ing." Ibid. As Judge Easterbrook succinctly put it, com-pelling or restricting "[p]rice advertising surely `relates to'

price." Illinois Corporate Travel v. American Airlines,
Inc., 889 F. 2d 751, 754 (CA7 1989), cert. denied, 495 U. S.
919 (1990).

Although the State insists that it is not compelling or re-stricting advertising, but is instead merely preventing the

market distortion caused by "false" advertising, in fact thedynamics of the air transportation industry cause the guidelines to curtail the airlines' ability to communicate fares totheir customers. The expenses involved in operating an airline flight are almost entirely fixed costs; they increase very
little with each additional passenger. The market for these
flights is divided between consumers whose volume of purchases is relatively insensitive to price (primarily business
travelers) and consumers whose demand is very price sensitive indeed (primarily pleasure travelers). Accordingly, airlines try to sell as many seats per flight as possible at higher
prices to the first group, and then to fill up the flight by
selling seats at much lower prices to the second group (since
almost all the costs are fixed, even a passenger paying far
below average cost is preferable to an empty seat). In order
for this marketing process to work, and for it ultimately to
redound to the benefit of price-conscious travelers, the airlines must be able to place substantial restrictions on the
availability of the lower priced seats (so as to sell as many
seats as possible at the higher rate), and must be able to
advertise the lower fares. The guidelines severely burden
their ability to do both at the same time: The sections requiring "clear and conspicuous disclosure" of each restriction
make it impossible to take out small or short ads, as does (to
a lesser extent) the provision requiring itemization of both
the one-way and round-trip fares. Since taxes and surcharges vary from State to State, the requirement that advertised fares include those charges forces the airlines to
create different ads in each market. The section restricting

504us1$u80 04-23-96 09:41:07 PAGES OPINPGT
390 MORALES v. TRANS WORLD AIRLINES, INC.

Opinion of the Court
the use of "sale," "discount," or "reduced" effectively pre-vents the airlines from using those terms to call attention to

the fares normally offered to price-conscious travelers. Asthe FTC observed, "[r]equiring too much information in advertisements can have the paradoxical effect of stifling theinformation that consumers receive." Letter from FTC to
Christopher Ames, Deputy Attorney General of California,dated Mar. 11, 1988, App. to Brief for Respondent Airlines
23a. Further, $ 2.4, by allowing fares to be advertised onlyif sufficient seats are available to meet demand or if the extent of unavailability is disclosed, may make it impossible touse this marketing process at all. All in all, the obligations
imposed by the guidelines would have a significant impactupon the airlines' ability to market their product, and hence
a significant impact upon the fares they charge.3In concluding that the NAAG fare advertising guidelines
are pre-empted, we do not, as Texas contends, set out on aroad that leads to pre-emption of state laws against gambling
and prostitution as applied to airlines. Nor need we addresswhether state regulation of the nonprice aspects of fare advertising (for example, state laws preventing obscene depic-tions) would similarly "relat[e] to" rates; the connection
would obviously be far more tenuous. To adapt to this caseour language in Shaw, "[s]ome state actions may affect [airline fares] in too tenuous, remote, or peripheral a manner"to have pre-emptive effect. 463 U. S., at 100, n. 21. In this
case, as in Shaw, "[t]he present litigation plainly does notpresent a borderline question, and we express no views
about where it would be appropriate to draw the line."
Ibid. Finally, we note that our decision does not give theairlines carte blanche to lie to and deceive consumers; the

3 The dissent disagrees with this--not, as it turns out, because it disputes our description of the pricing process in the airline industry, but
because it does not think that the guidelines would have a "significant"
effect on rates. Post, at 427. That conclusion is unexplained, and seems
to us inexplicable.

APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT
National Association of Attorneys GeneralTask Force on the Air Travel Industry

Revised Guidelines

INTRODUCTION
In June, 1987, the National Association of Attorneys Gen-eral ("NAAG") directed the appointment of a Task Force of

states to study the advertising and marketing practices ofthe airline industry in the United States. In addition to the
study, the Task Force was directed to determine the natureand extent of existing unfair and deceptive airline advertising practices and to report a recommended course of actionto NAAG at its meeting in December 1987.

The Task Force Report and Recommendations wereadopted by NAAG at its winter meeting on December 12,
1987, with a continuing direction to the Task Force (1) toreceive and examine any comments from industry, consumer
groups, federal agencies, and other interested parties; (2) toevaluate these comments; and (3) to report to NAAG at its

504us1$u80 04-23-96 09:41:07 PAGES OPINPGT
392 MORALES v. TRANS WORLD AIRLINES, INC.

Appendix to opinion of the Court
Spring 1988 meeting on the advisability of any modifications
of the Guidelines.

The Task Force received written comments from the Air
Transport Association, the American Association of Advertising Agencies, American Airlines, the Association of National Advertisers, the Council of Better Business Bureaus,
the Federal Trade Commission, the National Association of
Broadcasters, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, USAir,
and the U. S. Department of Transportation. Assistant attorneys general of the Task Force states evaluated these
comments, and reported their recommendations to NAAG.

On March 15, 1988, NAAG adopted the recommended
changes to the frequent flyer Guidelines and directed that
the comments to both the fare advertising and frequent flyer
Guidelines be changed to respond to valid concerns raised
by those filing comments. The Guidelines and comments
herein reflect the changes directed by NAAG.

NAAG also directed the chair of NAAG's Consumer Protection Committee to appoint four attorneys general to serve
on a continuing task force to evaluate the effectiveness of
the Guidelines and to continue discussions with members of
the industry and other interested parties. These attorneys
general are: John Van de Kamp (California), Neil F. Hartigan
(Illinois), Jim Mattox (Texas), and Kenneth O. Eikenberry
(Washington).

It is important to note that these Guidelines do not create
any new laws or regulations regarding the advertising practices or other business practices of the airline industry.
They merely explain in detail how existing state laws apply
to air fare advertising and frequent flyer programs. Each
Guideline is followed by a comment which summarizes:

x NAAG's intent with respect to that Guideline.
x Any relevant comments received by the Task Force.
x Any significant changes that were made to the

Guidelines.

Appendix to opinion of the Court

Section 1--Definitions
1.0 Advertisement means any oral, written, graphic or
pictorial statement made in the course of solicitation of
business. Advertisement includes, without limitation, any
statement or representation made in a newspaper, magazine
or other public publication, or contained in any notice, sign,
billboard, poster, display, circular, pamphlet, or letter (collectively called "print advertisements"), or on radio or television ("broadcast commercials").

Comment: This definition encompasses those materials
and media covered by most states' false advertising statutes.
"Print advertisements" and "broadcast commercial" are
separated into different categories because they are afforded
slightly different treatment under these Guidelines. This
represents a change from an earlier draft of the Guidelines
and is an attempt to address some of the airlines' concerns
regarding the difficulties of lengthy disclosures in broadcast commercials.

1.1 Award means any coupon, certificate, voucher, benefit
or tangible thing which is promised, given, sold or otherwise
transferred by an airline or program partner to a program
member in exchange for mileage, credits, bonuses, segments
or other units of value credited to a consumer as an incentive
to fly on any airline or to do business with any program
partner.

Comment: This definition, as well as definitions 1.2, 1.3,
1.4, 1.6, 1.9, and 1.10, is self-explanatory.

1.2 Award level means a specified amount of mileage or
number of credits, bonuses, segments or other units which a
program member must accumulate in order to receive an
award.

1.3 Blackout date means any date on which travel or use
of other program benefits is not permitted for program members seeking to redeem their award levels. This is a form
of capacity control.

504us1$u80 04-23-96 09:41:07 PAGES OPINPGT
394 MORALES v. TRANS WORLD AIRLINES, INC.

Appendix to opinion of the Court
1.4 Capacity control means the practice by which an airline or program partner restricts or otherwise limits the opportunity of program members to redeem their award levels
for travel or other benefits offered in the program.

1.5 Clear and conspicuous means that the statement, representation or term ("statement") being disclosed is of such
size, color contrast, and audibility and is so presented as to
be readily noticed and understood by the person to whom it
is being disclosed. All language and terms should be used
in accordance with their common or ordinary usage and
meaning. For example, "companion" should be used only
when it means any companion (i. e., any person traveling
with the program member), not solely family members. Without limiting the requirements of the preceding sentences:

(a) A statement in a print advertisement is considered

clear and conspicuous if a type size is used which is
at least one-third the size of the largest type size
used in the advertising. However, it need not be
larger than:

x 10-point type in advertisements that are 200

square inches or smaller, and
x 12-point type in advertisements that are larger

than 200 square inches.

If the statement is in the body copy of the advertisement, it may be in the same size type as the largest
type used in the body copy, and does not have to
meet these type-size requirements.
(b) A statement in a broadcast commercial is considered

clear and conspicuous if it is made orally and is as
clear and understandable in pace and volume as the
fare information.
(c) A statement on any billboard is considered clear and

conspicuous if a type is used which is at least onethird the size of the largest one size used on the
billboard.

395Cite as: 504 U. S. 374 (1992)
Appendix to opinion of the Court
(d) A statement required by Section 3, relating tofrequent flyer programs, is considered clear and

conspicuous if it is prominently located directly adja-cent to the materials to which it applies. Type size
should be no smaller than the most commonly-usedprint size in the document, but in no event smaller
than 10-point type. Any reservation of any right tomake future changes in the program or award levels
should be located prominently at the beginning ofprinted materials.

Comment: One of the most deceptive aspects of current air
fare advertisements is the completely inadequate mannerin which those advertisements disclose the restrictions and

limitations which apply to the advertised fares. The re-strictions disclosed in print advertisements are rarely located near the fare advertised and often appear only in
extremely small type at the bottom of the advertisement.In broadcast commercials, such disclosures are generally

absent from radio advertisements, and if included at allin television commercials appear as written disclosures
flashed on the screen much too quickly for the average per-son to read. On billboards any mention of restrictions on
advertised fares is unusual.

Given this background, NAAG believes that it is neces-sary to define clearly for the airlines what constitutes clear

and adequate disclosure in all advertising media. Thetype-size minima for print advertisements are aimed at
making the disclosures both easy to read and noticeable.Consequently, a slightly larger size print is suggested in
larger size advertisements. These type-size minima are not
absolute. That is, print disclosures do not in every in-stance have to be in at least 10-point type, as long as they

are clear and conspicuous regardless of the size of the type.The type size suggestions are merely examples of advertising practices which give an airline a reasonable expectationthat it will not be sued if it follows the Guidelines. In the

504us1$u80 04-23-96 09:41:07 PAGES OPINPGT
396 MORALES v. TRANS WORLD AIRLINES, INC.

Appendix to opinion of the Court
Task Force's meetings with the airlines last summer, one
common note expressed was that the airlines could abide by
disclosure guidelines, as long as they were clear and enforced uniformly. If an airline does not choose this safe
harbor and instead ventures into untested waters, it may
run aground and it may not. But it is free to do so.

The comments to this Guideline were critical largely because NAAG singled out airline advertisements for this
treatment. However, on the whole, the airlines indicated
they could meet the type size standard relatively easily in
print advertisements.

NAAG elected to encourage oral disclosures in broadcast
media, because written disclosures are difficult if not impossible to read and because many people listen to, rather
than watch television commercials. We continue to believe
that oral disclosure is the best method of conveying information in a television commercial. However, the converse
of this Guideline is not true--a disclosure in a television
commercial is not necessarily deceptive if it is instead made
in a video super or crawl, as long as it is still clear and
conspicuous.

For safety reasons, very large type is provided for
billboards.

1.6 Frequent flyer program means any program offered by
an airline or program partner in which awards are offered
to program members.

1.7 Limited-time availability means that the fare is only
available for a specific period of time or that the fare is not
available during certain blackout periods.

Comment: This definition applies to air fares that are
only available certain times of the year (e. g., available December 15 through April 15), are not available at certain
times at all (not available December 23 through January 5),
or are only available until a date certain (available only
until January 15). It does not apply to fares that are un504us1$u80 04-23-96 09:41:07 PAGES OPINPGT

397Cite as: 504 U. S. 374 (1992)
Appendix to opinion of the Court
available only on certain days of the week or times of the
day.

1.8 Material restriction means a restriction, limitation, orother requirement which affects the use or refundability of

a ticket, and which is not generally applicable to all classes
of fares or tickets (such as standard conditions of carriage).

Comment: Due to the numerous standard conditions applicable to most airline tickets, NAAG has confined the
definition of "material restrictions" to those restrictions
and limitations that are specific and unique to certain fare
categories (i. e., those that are different from the restrictions
and limitations that apply to a standard coach ticket).

1.9 Program member means any consumer who has applied and been accepted for membership in an airline's
frequent flyer program, regardless of whether he or she has
accrued mileage, credits, bonuses, segments or other units of
value on an airline or with any program partner.

1.10 Program partner means any business entity which
provides awards as part of an airline's frequent flyer
program.

1.11 Vested member means a member of a frequent flyer
program who is enrolled in an existing program and has provided consideration to the airline or its partners, and who
has not received adequate notice of program changes such as
set forth in Sections 3.2 and 3.9. For example, consideration
includes purchasing tickets on an airline, renting a car or
using a specific credit card.

Comment: This definition separates out those consumers
who joined a frequent flyer program without receiving adequate notice of how that program could change prospectively. The Guidelines afford some special protections to
vested members and vested miles. There is sound reason
for this.

After reviewing the travel reward promotional materials
for most of the major airlines, NAAG concluded that currently vested members have not received adequate disclo504us1$u80 04-23-96 09:41:07 PAGES OPINPGT
398 MORALES v. TRANS WORLD AIRLINES, INC.

Appendix to opinion of the Court
sure of the potential for significant increases in award lev-els or imposition of other restrictions which may result in

the airlines' unilateral devaluation of awards. Therefore,the Guidelines treat vested members and the miles which
members accrued before receiving adequate notice of prospective changes differently.1.12 Vested mile means program mileage (or other credits)

Section 2--Fare Advertisements
2.0 General guideline

Any advertisement which provides air fares or other priceinformation must be in plain language, clear and conspicuous,

and non-deceptive. Deception may result not only from adirect statement in the advertisement and from reasonable
inferences therefrom, but also omitting or obscuring a mate-rial restriction.

Comment: This Guideline and the following Guidelines
restate individual states' false advertising and deceptivepractices statutes as they apply to air fare and price

advertising.
2.1 Disclosure in print advertisements

Print advertisements for fares must make clear and con-spicuous disclosure of restrictions such as:

x Limited-time availability.
x Limitations on right to refund or exchange of ticket.
x Time of day or day of week restrictions.
x Length of stay requirements.

Appendix to opinion of the Court
x Advance purchase requirements.
x Round trip purchase requirements.
x Variations in fares to or from two or more airportsserving the same metropolitan area.

x Limitations on, or extra charges for, breaks or changesin itinerary, such as failure to travel on every leg as

scheduled.
x The statement, if any, required by Guideline 2.4.
x Any other material restriction on the fare.

This Guideline would be met by disclosing material re-strictions either:

x in the body copy of the advertisement,
x adjacent to the fare price, or
x in a box with a heading such as "Restrictions."

Examples (in 10-point type) of disclosures of material re-strictions if they apply to fares being advertised are:

In the body copy:
RESTRICTIONS. "Weekend traveler" fares are gen-erally available all day Saturday and Sunday until 6 p.m.

However, these fares are not available on some flightson some days.

In the box:
Restrictions

These restrictions apply to one or more of these fares:
x 30 day advance purchases required
x Not available November 20-December 1
x New York fares only to Newark Airport

or
Restrictions. Advertised fares are only available Tuesday,Wednesday, and Thursday afternoons. Three-day advance

purchases required. 50% cancellation penalty applies.

400 MORALES v. TRANS WORLD AIRLINES, INC.

Appendix to opinion of the Court
Comment: The advantage to consumers of print advertisements over television or radio advertisements is that
they give consumers something tangible to use as a reference when shopping for low cost air fares. Because consumers can take their time and carefully read a print advertisement it is especially important that this type of
advertisement contain the most accurate and complete information possible regarding any advertised air fares. The
restrictions singled out by NAAG in this Guideline for disclosure are those NAAG believes are the most significant to
a consumer contemplating purchasing a ticket. An advertisement that complies with this Guideline will give a consumer three crucial pieces of information:

1. Eligibility--consumers will know if they are eligible
for the fare (i. e., can a consumer meet advance purchase
requirements or other restrictions affecting time or date of
travel?);

2. Availability--consumers can accurately gauge the
likelihood that they will be able to obtain a ticket at the
advertised price; and

3. Risk--consumers will know the risks associated with
purchasing a ticket at the advertised price (i. e., is the ticket
non-refundable or do other penalties apply upon cancellation or changes in itinerary?).

This particular Guideline received a great deal of negative comment because the airlines and government agencies
misunderstood it to mean that it required full disclosure of
all of the restrictions that apply to each specific flight. This
is not correct. The Guideline only requires that if any of
the restrictions listed in the Guideline apply to any of the
air fares advertised then the advertisement must disclose
the existence of that restriction and the fact that the restriction applies to one or more of the air fares advertised. To
clear up this misunderstanding, NAAG included specific examples of the disclosures required by the revised Guidelines.
There was also some misunderstanding that disclosure in

504us1$u80 04-23-96 09:41:07 PAGES OPINPGT

401Cite as: 504 U. S. 374 (1992)
Appendix to opinion of the Court
a box was required. As the Guideline states, this is justone option.

The comments made to the December Guidelines evi-denced another misconception about the wording of the disclosures on fare restrictions. This Guideline provides suggested wording, again to assist the airlines in determininghow to meet the disclosures, but the language is by no means

sacrosanct. The best creative minds in the advertisingbusiness are available to the airlines through their advertising agencies. The airlines are free to avail themselves ofthese talents, who are certainly adept at phrasing a message
the advertiser wants to get across to the consumer. The
essence of the Guidelines is that consumers must be advisedof the limits which the airlines has [sic] chosen to impose

on consumers' ability to buy tickets at the advertised price.
2.2 Disclosure in broadcast commercials

Broadcast commercials for fares must make clear and con-spicuous disclosure of:

x Limited-time availability.
x Limitations on right to refund or exchange of ticket.
x The statement, if any, required by Guideline 2.4.

In addition, if the following seven disclosures are not madein a clear and conspicuous manner in the commercial, any

that are applicable must be disclosed orally to the passengerbefore reservations are actually made:

x Time of day or day of week restrictions.
x Length of stay requirements.
x Advance purchase requirements.
x Round trip purchase requirements.
x Variations in fares to or from two or more airportsserving the same metropolitan area.

x Limitations on, or extra charges for, breaks or changesin itinerary, such as failure to travel on every leg as

scheduled.

504us1$u80 04-23-96 09:41:07 PAGES OPINPGT
402 MORALES v. TRANS WORLD AIRLINES, INC.

Appendix to opinion of the Court
x Any other material restriction in the fare.
As to these seven types of disclosure, the airline may in-clude any or all in the commercial or may choose to defer

disclosure until the time reservations are actually made.If any of these seven disclosures applies to the fare advertised and the airline chooses to defer disclosure until the timethe reservations are actually made, the commercial must
give clear and conspicuous disclosure that "Other substantialrestrictions apply," or similar language. The statement
"Restrictions apply" is not sufficient.Comment: In an earlier draft, the Guidelines required
that radio and television advertisements include all thesame disclosures required in print advertisements. The
airline industry unanimously responded that such detaileddisclosures would be impossible to include in the 15 and 30
second advertising spots generally purchased for radio and
television ads, and argued that, even if time allowed thismuch oral disclosure, the resulting commercial would provide too much information for a consumer to absorb use-fully. They concluded that such a requirement would eliminate airline price advertising on television and radio.The provision of fare information, without stating the
most significant restrictions that apply to the fare advertised, is deceptive and ultimately harmful to consumers andthe airline industry alike.

The Guideline as revised provides a compromise. It sug-gests disclosure of the three most serious restrictions that
can apply to an airline ticket--limited time availability,nonrefundability or exchangeability and limitations on
fare availability. Disclosure of all of these restrictions can
be accomplished by something as simple as the followingstatement: "Tickets are nonrefundable, are not available on

all flights, and must be purchased by December 15. Othersignificant restrictions apply." These 20 words can easily
be read in a 30 second commercial. In addition, some orall of this information may be clearly and conspicuously

504us1$u80 04-23-96 09:41:07 PAGES OPINPGT

403Cite as: 504 U. S. 374 (1992)
Appendix to opinion of the Court
disclosed in a video super or crawl in television commercials. Of course, this option is not available for radio commercials. However, commenting airlines confirmed that
the typical radio spot is 60 seconds, making the concern
about time less crucial.

Airlines then have the option of disclosing any additional
material restrictions in the advertisement itself or deferring such disclosure until a consumer makes a reservation.
Of course, if an airline does not choose to restrict its fare
severely, fewer words (and thus, less air time) is needed.

This compromise position also recognizes that print advertising lends itself more readily to detailed information
in a form which the consumer can retain and refer to at his
own pace. For this reason, NAAG has chosen to require
less disclosure in broadcast, allowing print to be the medium for full disclosure.

2.3 Disclosure on billboards

Any billboard which provides air fare or other price information on a fare to which any material restrictions apply
must have clear and conspicuous language such as "Substantial restrictions apply." The statement "Restrictions apply"
is not sufficient.

Comment: For safety reasons, NAAG concluded that
lengthy written disclosures on billboards are inappropriate
and potentially hazardous to drivers. We disagree with the
DOT that this special treatment of price advertising on billboards will result in a proliferation of billboards on our
nation's highways.

2.4 Fare availability

Any advertised fare must be available in sufficient quantity so as to meet reasonably foreseeable demand on every
flight each day for the market in which the advertisement
appears, beginning on the day on which the advertisement

504us1$u80 04-23-96 09:41:07 PAGES OPINPGT
404 MORALES v. TRANS WORLD AIRLINES, INC.

Appendix to opinion of the Court
appears and continuing for at least three days after the advertisement terminates.

However, if the advertised fare is not thus available, the
advertisement must contain a clear and conspicuous statement to the extent of unavailability of the advertised fare.

Statements such as "Seats limited" and "Restrictions
apply" do not meet this Guideline. These examples do meet
this Guideline:

x This fare may not be available when you call.
x This fare is not available on all flights.
x This fare is only available on some Saturday and Sunday flights.

Comment: This Guideline elicited the greatest amount of
negative comments from the airline industry, the ATA, FTC
and the DOT. They argue that this Guideline is impossible
to implement because, due to the complexity of airline pricing systems, the number of seats available at a particular
low fare on a particular flight is not a fixed number. It is
continuously modified up to the point of departure. They
suggest that it is acceptable for the airlines to communicate
a general invitation to the public to buy low fare seats, but
then reduce the number of seats available to zero or close to
zero for the most popular flights, because the possibility that
a consumer can purchase a seat at the advertised price exists at the time the advertisement is placed.

The complexity of the airlines' system cannot justify the
unfairness of such an approach. No other retailer would
be allowed to justify a failure to stock an advertised item
on the grounds that, at the last minute the retailer decided
it was less costly not to stock the item it had just advertised.
The availability of an item advertised, at the price advertised, goes to the very heart of truthful advertising. If an
airline advertises an air fare that is not available on each
and every flight to the destination advertised, and this fact

504us1$u80 04-23-96 09:41:07 PAGES OPINPGT

405Cite as: 504 U. S. 374 (1992)
Appendix to opinion of the Court
is not disclosed, then the advertisement is deceptive on its
face.

While NAAG appreciates the difficulty of disclosing the
specific number of seats available on each flight advertised,
a disclosure that "This fare is not available on all flights"
or "This fare may not be available when you call" is not
particularly onerous. Absent such disclosure, airlines,
as all other retailers, should be required to have sufficient
stock available to meet reasonable demand for any fare
advertised.

2.5 Surcharges

Any fuel, tax, or other surcharge to a fare must be included in the total advertised price of the fare.

Comment: Recently, several airlines considered the possibility of passing along an increase in the cost of fuel to
consumers by imposing a "fuel surcharge" rather than simply raising air fares to reflect their increased costs. The air
fare advertised was to remain the same, but a footnote
would be added to the advertisement in the "mice type" disclosing that, for instance, a $16 fuel surcharge would be
tacked on to the advertised fare. The potential for abuse,
if this type of price advertising is permitted, is obvious. It
would only be a matter of time before $19 air fares from
New York to California could be advertised with $300 meal,
fuel, labor, and baggage surcharges added in a footnote.
The total advertised price of the fare must include all such
charges in order to avoid these potential abuses. However,
this Guideline should not be construed to require an airline
to do the impossible. We do not believe that such minimal
tour-related charges fall within the meaning of "fare" and
therefore do not believe that unknown charges must be disclosed as a surcharge (if the amounts are not in fact known).
This of course does not mean that charges which are
known--either as an exact amount or as a percentage--do
not have to be disclosed in advertisements.

406 MORALES v. TRANS WORLD AIRLINES, INC.

Appendix to opinion of the Court
2.6 Round trip fare advertising

If an airline elects to advertise the one-way portion of afare that is only available as a round-trip purchase, this restriction, together with the full round-trip fare, must be ad-vertised in a clear and conspicuous manner, at least as prominently as the one-way fare.Comment: Airlines routinely advertise one-half of the
price (i. e., the alleged "one-way" price) for tickets that areonly available if a consumer makes a round-trip purchase.
Under this Guideline, if an airline elects to continue thisadvertising practice, it must also disclose that the fare is
only available if a consumer purchases a round trip ticket
and the actual price of the full round trip ticket. The dis-closure must be made in a type size and location as prominent as the fare advertised.

The airlines have, for the most part, stated a willingness
to advertise the full round trip air fare if all of the airlines
do the same. This Guideline is intended to encourage all
airlines to adopt this practice.

2.7 Deceptive use of "sale," "discount," "reduced," or similar terms

A fare may be advertised by use of the words "sale," "discount," "reduced," or other such words that suggest that thefare advertised is a temporarily reduced fare and is not a

regularly-available fare only if that fare is:

x available only for a specified, limited period of time,

and
x substantially below the usual price for the same fare

with the same restrictions.

Comment: The majority of airline tickets sold each year
sell at prices significantly lower than the full "Y" or standard regular coach fare. These lower fares are offered year
round and airlines in theory allocate a certain amount of
seats to each fare "bucket." As a result, the regular coach

407Cite as: 504 U. S. 374 (1992)
Appendix to opinion of the Court
fare has ceased to have any meaning as a starting point for
determining whether or not a ticket is being offered for a
"sale" price as consumers have come to understand that
term.

In this Guideline NAAG has attempted to prevent consumer confusion by limiting the use of such words as "sale,"
"discount," or "reduced," to describe only those fares that
represent a true savings over regularly available air fares--
those that are available only for short periods of time and
are substantially below any regularly offered fare for a
ticket carrying identical restrictions.

Section 3--Frequent Flyer Programs

General Comments to Section 3
Frequent flyer programs have been widely acknowledged
as the most successful marketing programs in airline industry history. The bargain struck between customers and the
airlines has proven to be very costly to many of the airlines.
Customers who have accrued the necessary mileage are expecting to collect the awards which led them to join and fly
in the programs in the first place. Some airlines are now
disturbed by the cost of keeping their side of the bargain
and the real possibility that they may lose revenue because
passengers flying on frequent flyer awards may begin displacing paying customers. The solution contemplated by
some carriers has been to raise award thresholds and implement restrictions to decrease the cost to them of the award
program. The effect of these actual and/or potential
changes is to significantly devalue vested members' accrued
mileage or other credits in the program. Although various
frequent flyer program awards materials have contained
some obscure mention of the possibility of future program
changes, these disclosures have been wholly inadequate to
inform program members of the potentially major negative
changes which are contemplated by many airlines.

504us1$u80 04-23-96 09:41:07 PAGES OPINPGT
408 MORALES v. TRANS WORLD AIRLINES, INC.

Appendix to opinion of the Court
These Guidelines cover frequent flyer programs including
any partner airlines or other providers of goods or services
such as rental cars and hotel rooms. They are intended
to protect those consumers who have participated in these
programs in good faith, without adequate notice that the
programs could change, and to advise the airlines of how
they can reserve this right in the future by adequately providing this information to all members in a nondeceptive
manner consistent with state law.

3.0 Capacity controls

1. If an airline or its program partners employ capacity
controls, the airline must clearly and conspicuously disclose
in its frequent flyer program solicitations, newsletters, rules
and other bulletins the specific techniques used by the airline
or program partner to control capacity in any solicitation
which states a specific award. This includes blackout dates,
limits on percentage of seats (for example, "the number of
seats on any flight allocated to award recipients is limited"),
maximum number of seats or rooms allocated or any other
mechanism whereby the airline or program partner limits
the opportunities of program members redeeming frequent
flyer award levels. To meet this Guideline, all blackout
dates must be specifically disclosed.

2. As to awards for vested miles, the airline or program
partner must provide the award to the vested member without capacity controls or provide the award with capacity controls within a reasonable period of time. A reasonable period would be within 15 days before or after the date
originally requested. If all seats within this 31-day period
were sold at the time the vested member requested a reservation, so that the member could not be accommodated without displacing a passenger to whom a seat has been sold,
then a reasonable period would be the period to the first
available date on which every seat was not sold to the re504us1$u80 04-23-96 09:41:07 PAGES OPINPGT

409Cite as: 504 U. S. 374 (1992)
Appendix to opinion of the Court
quested destination at the time the program member requests a reservation.

Comment: All of the airlines that met with the Task Force
stated that they intended to retain the right to impose capacity controls, in the future, to limit the number of seats
available to consumers purchasing tickets with frequent
flyer award certificates. The imposition of capacity controls, including blackout dates, has the potential for unreasonably restricting the supply of seats or other benefits in
such a way as to significantly devalue the awards due vested
program members. NAAG found that this potential limitation has not been adequately disclosed to program members in the frequent flyer promotional materials we reviewed. This Guideline puts the airlines on notice as to
what information they should provide to consumers if they
want to impose capacity controls on the use of frequent flyer
awards at some future date.

In earlier drafts of the Guidelines the Task Force took the
position that capacity controls could not be applied to
awards based on any mileage or credits accrued by vested
members before they received adequate notice that capacity
controls could be imposed. However, as a compromise, and
to permit the airlines reasonable flexibility around holiday
or other peak travel times, the revised Guideline provides
for a reasonable time to accommodate passengers with
award tickets: a 31-day "time window"--15 days before and
15 days after the date requested for ticketing. This "time
window" allows the airlines to allocate capacity to meet demand over a reasonable, yet defined period of time. In the
event all flights to a certain destination are sold out during
the entire 31-day time window, ticketing on the next available seat would be reasonable. This approach has the additional benefit of being simple and straightforward to implement with less possibility of customer confusion and
frustration.

3.1 Program changes affecting vested members

1. Any airline or program partner that has not reservedthe right to make future changes in the manner required by

Sections 3.2 and 3.9 of these Guidelines and that changes anyaspect of its program (for example, imposition of capacity
controls, increases in award levels, or any other mechanismwhereby a vested member's ability to redeem any award will
be adversely affected) must protect vested program mem-bers. Examples which meet this Guideline are:

(a) All vested members may not be adversely affectedby that change for a reasonable period. A reasonable period would be one year following mailing ofnotice of that change.
(b) The airline or program partner may allow vestedmembers to lock in any award level which is in effect

immediately preceding any change in the program.That award level would be guaranteed for a period
of one year after mailing notice of any increase inaward levels. A vested member would also be permitted to change his or her selection to lock in adifferent award in existence at any time prior to an
increase in award levels.(c) The airline or program partner may credit vested
program members with miles or other units sufficientto assume that, at the time of any change in the program, the member will be able to claim the sameawards he or she could have claimed under the old
program.
Comment: This Guideline institutes corrective measures
to protect vested members and the mileage they accrued before receiving adequate notice that a program could change
to their detriment at some point in the future. The Guideline sets forth three acceptable alternative approaches to
allow airlines to change existing programs without unreasonably altering the rights and expectations of vested mem504us1$u80 04-23-96 09:41:07 PAGES OPINPGT

411Cite as: 504 U. S. 374 (1992)
Appendix to opinion of the Court
bers. For example, an airline may wish to create a new
program with higher award levels for persons who join in
the future. Guideline 3.1.1(a) grandfathers in vested members for a one-year period after notice. Guideline 3.1.1(b)
grandfathers only a specified locked-in award for a one-year
period after the effective date of the change and thereby
gives the member an additional year to accrue mileage or
units toward a specific award. Guideline 3.1.1(c) allows
the program to avoid the administrative problems of distinguishing between old and new members and old and new
award levels by equitably adjusting the award levels of the
vested members.

These examples are not the only ways in which airlines
can reasonably protect vested members when changing existing programs. They are intended to delineate minimum
acceptable standards.

3.2 Notice of Changes

1. Adequate notice of changes in current frequent flyer
program award levels must be provided to vested program
members by the airline or program partner to allow a reasonable time for the vested member to obtain and use an
award. For example, a notice no less than one year prior
to the effective date of such change would be reasonable.
Reduction in award levels would not require such notice.

2. Any airline which has a policy of deleting program
members from its mailing list for notices and statements
must clearly and conspicuously disclose that policy in plain
language in its rules and regulations.

3. To reserve the right to make future changes in the
award levels and program conditions or restrictions in a manner providing reasonable notice consistent with state law,
which notice is less than the notice set forth in Guideline
3.2.1, an airline must first clearly and conspicuously disclose
that reservation and the nature of such future changes, in
plain language. This disclosure should include examples

504us1$u80 04-23-96 09:41:07 PAGES OPINPGT
412 MORALES v. TRANS WORLD AIRLINES, INC.

Appendix to opinion of the Court
which make clear the outer limits within which programawards may be changed. For example, the following is not

adequate disclosure:

"Program rules, regulations and mileage levels are sub-ject to change without notice."

This example is adequate disclosure:

"(Airline) reserves the right to terminate the programwith six months notice. This means that regardless of

the amount you participate in this program, your rightto accumulate mileage and claim awards can be terminated six months after we give you notice."
Or:

"(Airline) reserves the right to change the programrules, regulations, and mileage level. This means that

(Airline) may raise mileage levels, add an unlimitednumber of blackout days, or limit the number of seats
available to any or all destinations with notice. Pro-gram members may not be able to use awards to certain
destinations, or may not be able to obtain certain typesof awards such as cruises."

Or, if the airline so intends, the disclosure might also say:

"In any case, (Airline) will make award travel availablewithin days of a program member's requested date,

except for blackout dates listed here."
The airline's right to make future changes, in a manner otherthan that provided in Guideline 3.1, shall apply only to mileage accrued after members receive the notice required bythis Guideline.

Comment: In the past, airlines have attempted to reservethe right to make radical future changes in their programs
by using such vague and uncertain blanket language as"Subject to additions, deletions, or revisions at any time."
The consumer outrage that ensued when several of the

504us1$u80 04-23-96 09:41:07 PAGES OPINPGT

413Cite as: 504 U. S. 374 (1992)
Appendix to opinion of the Court
major airlines attempted unilaterally to change their programs in the winter of 1986-87 makes it clear that consumers were not adequately told, when they joined and participated in frequent flyer programs, that they were taking a
gamble that the award they were striving for would still be
available, at the mileage level originally advertised by the
time they accrued the necessary miles. To avoid a recurrence of this same problem in the future, this Guideline
provides that the potential for such extensive program
changes must be clearly and conspicuously disclosed to the
public by specific example. It also puts the airlines on notice that (1) their previous attempts to disclose this critical
information have been inadequate, (2) if they intend to reserve the right to make such changes in the future, they
must give members new and different notice, and (3) as to
vested members, airlines cannot implement any adverse
changes until one year after notice is given. One year is
deemed reasonable because many consumers can only
travel during particular periods of the year due to work or
family constraints, and therefore notice of less than a year
may impact unduly harshly on a particular class of program members.

If an airline wants to reserve the rights to change the
terms of its program without giving its members one year's
notice (1) it can do so only after clear and adequate notice
has been given to the program members and (2) this reduced
standard can apply only to mileage accrued after clear and
adequate notice has been given.

NAAG discovered that many airlines delete program
members from their mailing lists if they are determined to
be "inactive." Inactive is defined differently by each airline, but generally includes some formula requiring active
participation in the program within a six to ten month period prior to any given mailing. Because crucial information regarding changes is included in program mailings, the
Guidelines require that any airline with a policy of deleting

504us1$u80 04-23-96 09:41:07 PAGES OPINPGT
414 MORALES v. TRANS WORLD AIRLINES, INC.

Appendix to opinion of the Court
program members from its mailing list clearly and conspicuously disclose that policy in the rules and regulations distributed to all program members when they join.

3.3 Fare or passenger class limitations

Any limitation upon the type or class of fare with which an
upgrade certificate, discount flight coupon, or free companion
coupon may be used must be clearly and conspicuously disclosed before the program member claims the award. Disclosure of the fare by airline terminology (for example, "Y
Class") is not deemed sufficient.

Comment: Many airlines are encouraging consumers to
use their accrued mileage or credits to obtain upgrade certificates or free campaign coupons, rather than free tickets
because this is more cost effective for the airlines. Many of
these coupons and certificates can be used only in conjunction with a regular coach fare ticket. Because of the high
cost of a full coach ticket (often disclosed only as "Y Class")
many of these coupons and certificates represent no real
savings and therefore are useless to consumers. This
Guideline requires that any such restriction be clearly disclosed to consumers before the award is claimed.

3.4 Certificates issued for vested miles

Certificates, coupons, vouchers, or tickets issued by an airline for awards redeemed for vested miles must be valid for
a reasonable period of time. One year is deemed to be reasonable. Any restrictions on use, redeposit, extension, or
re-issuance of certificates must be clearly and conspicuously
disclosed on the certificate and in any rules, regulations,
newsletter or other program materials.

Comment: Again, because many consumers may only
travel during certain periods of the year, fairness requires
that awards be valid for at least a full twelve month cycle.

415Cite as: 504 U. S. 374 (1992)
Appendix to opinion of the Court
3.5 Fees

Any airline which charges a fee for enrollment in its
frequent flyer program must fully disclose at airline ticketcounters and in all advertisements, solicitations or other materials distributed to prospective members prior to enroll-ment all terms and conditions of the frequent flyer program.
Such disclosure must be made prior to accepting payment
for enrollment in the airline's program.

Comment: Some airlines have required that consumers
fill out a membership application and pay a membership
fee before obtaining a copy of the program rules and regulations. Because of the serious restrictions that can apply to
a travel reward program, it is essential that all consumers
have an opportunity to review all of the program rules and
regulations before paying an enrollment fee.

3.6 Redemption time

All airlines must disclose clearly and conspicuously the actual time necessary for processing award redemption requests where such requests are not normally processed
promptly. An example of prompt processing would be
within 14 days of processing the request. An example of
a disclosure would be "processing of awards may take up
to 30 days."

Comment: The airlines indicated that full disclosure of
redemption time will not be a problem.

3.7 Termination of program affecting vested members

In the event a frequent flyer program is terminated, adequate notice of termination must be sent to all vested members so that vested members have a reasonable time to obtain awards and use them. Adequate notice would be notice
at least one year prior to the termination of the program.
Award levels in existence prior to such notice should remain
in effect for one year. Program members should then have
one year to use certificates, coupons, vouchers or tickets.

504us1$u80 04-23-96 09:41:07 PAGES OPINPGT
416 MORALES v. TRANS WORLD AIRLINES, INC.

Appendix to opinion of the Court
Any applicable capacity controls should be modified as necessary to meet the demand for all award benefits due program members.

Comment: The airlines uniformly take the position that
because participation in travel reward programs is "free,"
an airline should be able to terminate a travel reward program at any time without notice. NAAG strenuously disagrees. Consumers pay significant consideration for the
airlines' promise to award them "free tickets" and other
awards. Program members fly on a particular airline to
accrue mileage in a travel reward program often foregoing
a more convenient departure time, a more direct flight, and
even a less expensive ticket. Those consumers who kept
their part of the bargain have a right to expect the airlines
to keep theirs, regardless of the cost. This Guideline affords consumers reasonable protection against unilateral
changes. It gives consumers one year to accrue the mileage
to reach a desired award level and one year to use the award.

This Guideline is intended to apply to programs that
are terminated due to mergers or for any other reason. It
would be unconscionable to permit airlines, which have
reaped the rewards of these travel incentive programs, to
walk away from their obligations to consumers under any
circumstances.

3.8 Restrictions

All material restrictions on frequent flyer programs
must be clearly and conspicuously disclosed to current program members and to prospective members at the time of
enrollment.

Comment: This Guideline is intended as a corrective
measure. Any airline that has not clearly and conspicuously disclosed material program restrictions to vested
members should do so now. New members are entitled to
full disclosure at the time of enrollment.

Appendix to opinion of the Court
3.9 Method of disclosure

Disclosures referred to in these Guidelines should be made
in frequent flyer program solicitations, newsletters, rules,
and other bulletins in a clear and conspicuous manner so as
to assure that all program members receive adequate notice.
As used in these Guidelines, disclosure also refers to information on program partners.

Comment: The brochures containing the rules and regulations for airlines' frequent flyer programs have been as long
as 52 pages. Extremely important restrictions are often
buried under inappropriate topic headings or hidden on the
back of the last inside pages of the brochure. This Guideline requires that restrictions be disclosed in reasonable
print size in a location that will be most helpful and informative to consumers.

Any reservation of the right to make future changes in a
program is so significant to consumers that it should be
disclosed prominently to insure that the maximum number
of people see and read this restriction. The Guideline permits the airlines flexibility to determine when and how
often a disclosure must be made so long as the airline discloses the information in a manner which gives meaningful
notice to all affected members.

One airline complained that Guideline 3.9 is unreasonable because it proposes that all the restrictions be disclosed
at the beginning of the program brochure. In fact, the only
disclosure the Guidelines suggested listing at the beginning
of a brochure is the reservation of the right to change the
program prospectively. The significance of such a restriction--that the terms and conditions of the program can
change at any moment--is so critical that potential members should be made aware of it immediately. All other
disclosures can be made in the text of the brochure.

Appendix to opinion of the Court
Section 4--Compensation for VoluntaryDenied Boarding

4.0 Disclosure of policies

If an airline chooses to offer ticketed passengers incentives
to surrender their tickets on overbooked flights, the airlinemust clearly and conspicuously disclose all terms and conditions of the proposal--including any restrictions on offers offuture air travel--to the person to whom the offer is made,
and in the same manner in which the offer is made, beforethe person accepts the offer.

Comment: Federal regulations offer specific protections
and certain rights to individuals who are involuntarily
bumped from a flight. Airlines, however, are free to offer
whatever compensation they want to people who voluntarily
give up their seat on an airplane because of overbooking.
For economic reasons, airlines prefer to offer vouchers good
for free tickets on future flights, instead of cash compensation to these passengers.

While these vouchers may seem very attractive to a consumer who has the flexibility to wait for a later flight, many
carry serious restrictions on their use or are subject to
lengthy black out periods when they cannot be used.

This Guideline requires that airlines fully disclose any
and all restrictions on offers for future air travel, before a
consumer agrees to give up his or her seat. It does not, as
several airlines and government agencies argued in their
responsive comments, set any standards for the type of compensation that airlines must offer to these passengers.

CONCLUSION
Consumer dissatisfaction with the airline industry hasreached crisis proportions. Federal agencies have focused

their attention on airline scheduling problems, on-time performance, safety, and other related issues, but have not addressed airline advertising and frequent flyer programs. Un504us1$u80 04-23-96 09:41:07 PAGES OPINPGT

checked, the airlines have engaged in practices in these areasthat are unfair and deceptive under state law. The individual states through NAAG can play an important role in elim-inating such practices through these Guidelines.

Justice Blackmun join, dissenting.

In cases construing the "virtually unique pre-emption pro-vision" in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of

1974 (ERISA), see Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. ConstructionLaborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1, 24,
n. 26 (1983), we have given the words "relate to" a broadreading. The construction of that unique provision was supported by a consideration of the relationship between differ-ent subsections of ERISA that have no parallel in other federal statutes, see Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85,98 (1983), and by the legislative history of the provision,

id.,at 98-99. Today we construe a pre-emption provision in the

Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA), 49 U. S. C. App.$ 1301

et seq., a statute containing similar, but by no meansidentical, language. Instead of carefully examining the language, structure, and history of the ADA, the Court decidesthat it is "appropriate," given the similarity in language, to
give the ADA pre-emption provision a similarly broad read-ing. Ante, at 384. In so doing, the Court disregards established canons of statutory construction, and gives the ADApre-emption provision a construction that is neither compelled by its text nor supported by its legislative history.

(1981). We therefore approach pre-emption questions witha "presum[ption] that Congress did not intend to pre-empt
areas of traditional state regulation." Metropolitan Life,471 U. S., at 740.

Section 105(a) of the ADA provides, in relevant part, "noState or political subdivision thereof . . . shall enact or enforce any law . . . relating to rates, routes, or services ofany air carrier having authority under subchapter IV of this
chapter to provide air transportation." 49 U. S. C. App.$ 1305(a). By definition, a state law prohibiting deceptive or
misleading advertising of a product "relates," "pertains," or"refers" first and foremost to the advertising (and, in particular, to the deceptive or misleading aspect of the advertising)rather than to the product itself. That is not to say, of
course, that a prohibition of deceptive advertising does notalso relate indirectly to the particular product being advertised. It clearly does, for one cannot determine whether ad-vertising is misleading without knowing the characteristics
of the product being advertised. But that does not alter thefact that the prohibition is designed to affect the nature of
the advertising, not the nature of the product.1

1 The court in a similar case arising in New York explained this distinction well:

"[A]ny relationship between New York's enforcement of its laws against
deceptive advertising and Pan Am's rates, routes, and services is remote
and indirect. In challenging Pan Am's advertising, New York does not
care about how much Pan Am charges, where it flies, or what amenities it
provides its passengers. Its sole concern is with the manner in which
Pan Am advertises those matters to New York consumers. Thus, as far
as New York is concerned, Pan Am is free to charge $200 or $2,000 for a
flight from LaGuardia to London, but it cannot take out a full-page newspaper advertisement telling consumers the fare is $200 if in fact it is
$2,000. Similarly, Pan Am remains free to route a plane from Ithaca to
Istanbul with as many stops in between as it chooses, but it cannot market
that flight to New York consumers as a `direct' flight." New York v. Trans
World Airlines, Inc., 728 F. Supp. 162, 176 (SDNY 1989); see also People

Stevens, J., dissenting
Thus, although I agree that the plain language of $ 105(a)pre-empts any state law that relates directly to rates, routes,

or services, the presumption against pre-emption of tradi-tional state regulation counsels that we not interpret $ 105(a)
to pre-empt every traditional state regulation that mighthave some indirect connection with, or relationship to, airline
rates, routes, or services unless there is some indication thatCongress intended that result. To determine whether Congress had such an intent, I believe that a consideration of thehistory and structure of the ADA is more illuminating than
a narrow focus on the words "relating to."

The basic economic policy of the Nation is one favoringcompetitive markets in which individual entrepreneurs are

free to make their own decisions concerning price and out-put. Since 1890 the Sherman Act's prohibition of collusive
restrictions on production and pricing have been the centrallegislative expression of that policy.

National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U. S. 679, 695(1978). In 1914 Congress sought to promote that policy by

enacting the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA), whichcreated the Federal Trade Commission and gave it the power
to prohibit "[u]nfair methods of competition in commerce."38 Stat. 719, codified as amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 45(a)(1). That
type of prohibition is entirely consistent with a free marketin which prices and production are not regulated by Government decree.In 1938 Congress enacted two statutes that are relevant
to today's inquiry. In March it broadened $ 5 of the FTCAby giving the Commission the power to prohibit "unfair or
deceptive acts or practices in commerce" as well as "[u]nfair

Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938. $ 411, 52 Stat. 1003. Thatstatute created the Civil Aeronautics Board and mandated
that it regulate entry into the interstate airline industry, theroutes that airlines could fly, and the fares that they could
charge consumers.2 52 Stat. 987-994. Moreover, the stat-ute contained a provision, patterned after $ 5 of the FTCA,
giving the Civil Aeronautics Board the power to prohibit"unfair or deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition in air transportation." 52 Stat. 1003; see also American Airlines, Inc. v. North American Airlines, Inc., 351 U. S.79, 82 (1956). But the Board's power in this regard was not

exclusive, for the statute also contained a "saving clause"that preserved existing common-law and statutory remedies
for deceptive practices.3 See 52 Stat. 1027; Nader v. Alle-gheny Airlines, Inc., 426 U. S. 290, 298-300 (1976).

Although the 1938 Act was replaced by a similar regula-tory scheme in 1958,

4 the principal provisions of the statute

remained in effect until 1978. In that year, Congress de-cided to withdraw economic regulation of interstate airline

rates, routes, and services. Congress therefore enacted theADA "to encourage, develop, and attain an air transportation
system which relies on competitive market forces to deter-mine the quality, variety, and price of air services." H. R.
Conf. Rep. No. 95-1779, p. 53 (1978). Because that goalwould obviously have been frustrated if state regulations

were substituted for the recently removed federal regula-tions, Congress thought it necessary to pre-empt such state

regulation. Consequently, Congress enacted $ 105(a) of theAct, which pre-empts any state regulation "relating to rates,
routes, or services of any air carrier having authority undersubchapter IV of this chapter to provide air transportation."
49 U. S. C. App. $ 1305(a)(1).At the same time, Congress retained $ 411, which gave the
Civil Aeronautics Board the power to prohibit "unfair ordeceptive practices or unfair methods of competition in air
transportation." 49 U. S. C. App. $ 1381(a). Congress alsoretained the saving clause that preserved common-law and
statutory remedies for fraudulent and deceptive practices.See $ 1506; Nader, 426 U. S., at 298-300. Moreover, the
state prohibitions against deceptive practices that had coex-isted with federal regulation in the airline industry for 40
years, and had coexisted with federal regulation of unfairtrade practices in other areas of the economy since 1914,

were not mentioned in either the ADA or its legislativehistory.

In short, there is no indication that Congress intended toexempt airlines from state prohibitions of deceptive advertising. Instead, this history suggests that the scope of the

5 The FTCA does not, by its own force, pre-empt state prohibitions of
unfair and deceptive trade practices. Thus, unless a state prohibition conflicts with a Federal Trade Commission rule, state laws and regulations
are not pre-empted. See, e. g., American Financial Services Assn. v.
FTC, 247 U. S. App. D. C. 167, 199-200, 767 F. 2d 957, 989-991 (1985);

Duke L. J. 225.

Because the Department of Transportation has authority to prohibit
unfair or deceptive practices and unfair methods of competition in air
transportation, 49 U. S. C. App. $ 1381, it, too, could promulgate regulations that would pre-empt inconsistent state laws and regulations. But
the Court does not rest its holding on the fact that the state prohibitions
of unfair and deceptive advertising conflict with federal regulations; instead, it relies on the much broader holding that the ADA itself pre-empts
state prohibitions of deceptive advertising.

Stevens, J., dissenting
prohibition of state regulation should be measured by the
scope of the federal regulation that was being withdrawn.

This is essentially the position adopted by the Civil Aeronautics Board, which interpreted the scope of $ 105 in light
of its two underlying policies--to prevent state economic
regulation from frustrating the benefits of federal deregulation, and to clarify the confusion under the prior law which
permitted some dual state and federal regulation of the rates
and routes of the same carrier. 44 Fed. Reg. 9948, 9949
(1979). The Board thus explained:

"Section 105 forbids state regulation of a federally
authorized carrier's routes, rates, or services. Clearly,
states may not interfere with a federal carrier's decision
on how much to charge or which markets to serve. . . .
Similarly, a state may not interfere with the services
that carriers offer in exchange for their rates. . . .. . . . .

"Accordingly, we conclude that preemption extends to
all of the economic factors that go into the provision
of the quid pro quo for passenger's fare, including

flight frequency and timing, liability limits, reservation
and boarding practices, insurance, smoking rules, meal
service, entertainment, bonding and corporate financing . . . ." Id., at 9950-9951.

See also Freeman, State Regulation of Airlines and the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, 44 J. Air L. & Com. 747, 766-
767 (1979).

Because Congress did not eliminate federal regulation of
unfair or deceptive practices, and because state and federal
prohibitions of unfair or deceptive practices had coexisted
during the period of federal regulation, there is no reason
to believe that Congress intended $ 105(a) to immunize the
airlines from state liability for engaging in deceptive or
misleading advertising.

The Court finds in Congress' choice of the words "relatingto" an intent to adopt a broad pre-emption provision, analogous to the broad ERISA pre-emption provision. See ante,at 383-384. The legislative history does not support that
assumption, however. The bill proposed by the Civil Aero-nautics Board provided that "[n]o State . . . shall enact any
law . . . relating to rates, routes, or services in air transporta-tion." Hearings on H. R. 8813 before the Subcommittee on
Aviation of the House Committee on Public Works andTransportation, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 200 (1977).
Yet the Board's accompanying prepared testimony neitherfocused on the "relating to" language nor suggested that
those words were intended to effect a broad scope of pre-emption; instead, the testimony explained that the preemption section was "added to make clear that no state orpolitical subdivision may defeat the purposes of the bill by
regulating interstate air transportation. This provisionrepresents simply a codification of existing law and leaves
unimpaired the states' authority over intrastate matters."
Id., at 243.The "relating to" language in the bill that was finally enacted by Congress came from the House bill. But the HouseCommittee Report--like the Civil Aeronautics Board--did
not describe the pre-emption provision in the broad termsadopted by the Court today; instead, the Report described
the scope of the pre-emption provision more narrowly, sayingthat it "provid[ed] that when a carrier operates under authority granted pursuant to title IV of the Federal AviationAct, no State may regulate that carrier's routes, rates or
services." H. R. Rep. No. 95-1211, p. 16 (1978).The pre-emption section in the Senate bill, on the other
hand, did not contain the "relating to" language. That billprovided, "[n]o State shall enact any law, establish any standard determining routes, schedules, or rates, fares, or chargesin tariffs of, or otherwise promulgate economic regulations

for, any air carrier . . . ." S. 2493, $ 423(a)(1), reprinted inS. Rep. No. 95-631, p. 39 (1978). The Senate Report explained that this section "prohibits States from exercisingeconomic regulatory control over interstate airlines." Id.,
at 98.The Conference Report explained that the Conference
adopted the House bill (with an exception not relevant here),which it described in the more narrow terms used in the
House Report. H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 95-1779, pp. 94-95(1978). There is, therefore, no indication that the conferees
thought the House's "relating to" language would have abroader pre-emptive scope than the Senate's "determining
. . . or otherwise promulgate economic regulation" language.6Nor is there any indication that the House and conferees
thought that the pre-emption of state laws "relating to rates,routes, or services" pre-empted substantially more than
state laws "regulating rates, routes, or services."

IV
Even if I were to agree with the Court that state regula-tion of deceptive advertising could "relat[e] to rates" within

the meaning of $ 105(a) if it had a "significant impact" uponrates,

ante, at 390, I would still dissent. The airlines' theo-retical arguments have not persuaded me that the NAAG

guidelines will have a significant impact upon the price ofairline tickets. The airlines' argument (which the Court
adopts, ante, at 388-390) is essentially that (1) airlines mustengage in price discrimination in order to compete and operate efficiently; (2) a modest amount of misleading price ad-vertising may facilitate that practice; (3) thus compliance
with the NAAG guidelines might increase the cost of priceadvertising or reduce the sales generated by the advertise6 Because the Court overlooks the phrase "or otherwise promulgate economic regulations" in the Senate bill, see ante, at 385-386, n. 2, it incorrectly assumes that the Senate bill had a narrower pre-emptive scope than
the House bill.

ments; (4) as the costs increase and revenues decrease, theairlines might purchase less price advertising; and (5) a reduction in price advertising might cause a reduction in pricecompetition, which, in turn, might result in higher airline
rates. This argument is not supported by any legislative orjudicial findings.

Even on the assumption that the Court's economic reason-ing is sound and restrictions on price advertising could affect
rates in this manner, the airlines have not sustained theirburden of proving that compliance with the NAAG guidelines would have a "significant" effect on their ability to mar-ket their product and, therefore, on their rates.

7 Surely

Congress could not have intended to pre-empt every stateand local law and regulation that similarly increases the airlines' costs of doing business and, consequently, has a similar"significant impact" upon their rates.

For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.

7 They have not demonstrated, for example, that the costs of purchasing
the space for the "Restrictions box" required by $ 2.1, or the broadcast
time to state the two-sentence disclosure required by $ 2.2, will have a
significant effect on rates. Nor can it realistically be maintained that

$ 2.7's requirement that words such as "sale," "discount," or "reduced" may
only be used if the fare is, in fact, on sale (i. e., is available for a limited
time and is substantially below the usual price) will hinder the airlines'
ability to market and sell their low-priced fares. Finally, they surely have
not proved that $ 2.4's requirement that fares be advertised only if sufficient seats are available to meet demand or the extent of unavailability
disclosed will make it impossible for the airlines to market and sell different seats at different prices. That section expressly permits the airlines
to advertise low-priced fares that are available in limited quantities; it
simply requires that they include a disclaimer, such as "This fare may
not be available when you call." See National Association of Attorneys
General, Task Force on Air Travel Industry, Guidelines $ 2.4 (1988), reprinted in App. to Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24a-25a.

BURDICK v. TAKUSHI, DIRECTOR OF ELECTIONSOF HAWAII,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 91-535. Argued March 24, 1992--Decided June 8, 1992
Petitioner, a registered Honolulu voter, filed suit against respondent state

officials, claiming that Hawaii's prohibition on write-in voting violated
his rights of expression and association under the First and Fourteenth
Amendments. The District Court ultimately granted his motion for
summary judgment and injunctive relief, but the Court of Appeals
reversed, holding that the prohibition, taken as part of the State's comprehensive election scheme, does not impermissibly burden the right
to vote.

Held: Hawaii's prohibition on write-in voting does not unreasonably infringe upon its citizens' rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Pp. 432-442.

(a) Petitioner assumes erroneously that a law that imposes any burden on the right to vote must be subject to strict scrutiny. This Court's
cases have applied a more flexible standard: A court considering a state
election law challenge must weigh the character and magnitude of the
asserted injury to the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights that the
plaintiff seeks to vindicate against the precise interests put forward by
the State as justification for the burden imposed by its rule, taking into
consideration the extent to which those interests make it necessary to
burden the plaintiff's rights. Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780,
788-789. Under this standard, a regulation must be narrowly drawn to
advance a state interest of compelling importance only when it subjects
the voters' rights to "severe" restrictions. Norman v. Reed, 502 U. S.
279, 289. If it imposes only "reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions" upon those rights, the State's important regulatory interests
are generally sufficient to justify the restrictions. Anderson, supra, at
788. Pp. 432-434.

(b) Hawaii's write-in vote prohibition imposes a very limited burden
upon voters' rights to associate politically through the vote and to have
candidates of their choice placed on the ballot. Because the State's election laws provide easy access to the primary ballot until the cutoff date
for the filing of nominating petitions, two months before the primary,
any burden on the voters' rights is borne only by those who fail to
identify their candidate of choice until shortly before the primary. An

interest in making a late rather than an early decision is entitled to little
weight. Cf. Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724, 736. Pp. 434-439.

(c) Hawaii's asserted interests in avoiding the possibility of unrestrained factionalism at the general election and in guarding against
"party raiding" during the primaries are legitimate and are sufficient to
outweigh the limited burden that the write-in voting ban imposes upon
voters. Pp. 439-440.

(d) Indeed, the foregoing analysis leads to the conclusion that where,
as here, a State's ballot access laws pass constitutional muster as imposing only reasonable burdens on First and Fourteenth Amendment
rights, a write-in voting prohibition will be presumptively valid, since
any burden on the right to vote for the candidate of one's choice will be
light and normally will be counterbalanced by the very state interests
supporting the ballot access scheme. Pp. 441-442.

Opinion of the Court
Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court.
The issue in this case is whether Hawaii's prohibition onwrite-in voting unreasonably infringes upon its citizens'

rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Peti-tioner contends that the Constitution requires Hawaii to provide for the casting, tabulation, and publication of write-invotes. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit disagreed, holding that the prohibition, taken as part of theState's comprehensive election scheme, does not impermissibly burden the right to vote. 937 F. 2d 415, 422 (1991).We affirm.

Petitioner is a registered voter in the city and county ofHonolulu. In 1986, only one candidate filed nominating

papers to run for the seat representing petitioner's districtin the Hawaii House of Representatives. Petitioner wrote
to state officials inquiring about Hawaii's write-in voting pol-icy and received a copy of an opinion letter issued by the

The Court of Appeals entered the stay, id., at 109, andvacated the judgment of the District Court, reasoning that
consideration of the federal constitutional question raised bypetitioner was premature because "neither the plain language of Hawaii statutes nor any definitive judicial inter-pretation of those statutes establishes that the Hawaii legislature has enacted a ban on write-in voting," Burdick v.
Takushi, 846 F. 2d 587, 588 (CA9 1988). Accordingly, theCourt of Appeals ordered the District Court to abstain, see

Railroad Comm'n of Texas v. Pullman Co., 312 U. S. 496(1941), until state courts had determined whether Hawaii's
election laws permitted write-in voting.1On remand, the District Court certified the following three
questions to the Supreme Court of Hawaii:

"(1) Does the Constitution of the State of Hawaii re-quire Hawaii's election officials to permit the casting of

write-in votes and require Hawaii's election officials tocount and publish write-in votes?

"(2) Do Hawaii's election laws require Hawaii's elec-tion officials to permit the casting of write-in votes and
require Hawaii's election officials to count and publishwrite-in votes?

"(3) Do Hawaii's election laws permit, but not require,Hawaii's election officials to allow voters to cast writein votes and to count and publish write-in votes?" App.to Pet. for Cert. 56a-57a.

1 While petitioner's appeal was pending, he became concerned that the
Court of Appeals might not enter its decision before the September 1988
primary election. Accordingly, petitioner filed a second suit challenging
the unavailability of write-in voting in the 1988 election. Burdick v. Cayetano, Civ. No. 99-0365. Coincidentally, petitioner's new suit was filed on
the very day that the Ninth Circuit decided the appeal stemming from
petitioner's original complaint. The two actions subsequently were consolidated by the District Court. 1 App. 142.

432 BURDICK v. TAKUSHI

Opinion of the Court
Hawaii's high court answered "No" to all three questions,holding that Hawaii's election laws barred write-in voting

and that these measures were consistent with the State'sConstitution.

Burdick v. Takushi, 70 Haw. 498, 776 P. 2d
824 (1989). The United States District Court then granted
petitioner's renewed motion for summary judgment and in-junctive relief, but entered a stay pending appeal. 737

F. Supp. 582 (Haw. 1990).

The Court of Appeals again reversed, holding that Hawaii
was not required to provide for write-in votes:

"Although the prohibition on write-in voting places some
restrictions on [petitioner's] rights of expression and association, that burden is justified in light of the ease of
access to Hawaii's ballots, the alternatives available to
[petitioner] for expressing his political beliefs, the
State's broad powers to regulate elections, and the
specific interests advanced by the State." 937 F. 2d,
at 421.2

In so ruling, the Ninth Circuit expressly declined to follow
an earlier decision regarding write-in voting by the Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. See ibid., citing Dixon v.
Maryland State Administrative Bd. of Election Laws, 878
F. 2d 776 (CA4 1989). We granted certiorari to resolve the
disagreement on this important question. 502 U. S. 1003

Petitioner proceeds from the erroneous assumption that a
law that imposes any burden upon the right to vote must be
subject to strict scrutiny. Our cases do not so hold.

2 The Ninth Circuit panel issued its opinion on March 1, 1991. See Burdick v. Takushi, 927 F. 2d 469. On June 28, 1991, the Court of Appeals
denied petitioner's petition for rehearing and suggestion for rehearing en
banc, and the panel withdrew its original opinion and issued the version
that appears at 937 F. 2d 415.

It is beyond cavil that "voting is of the most fundamen-tal significance under our constitutional structure."

Illinois
Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U. S. 173,184 (1979). It does not follow, however, that the right to

vote in any manner and the right to associate for political
purposes through the ballot are absolute. Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U. S. 189, 193 (1986). The Constitution provides that States may prescribe "[t]he Times, Placesand Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives," Art. I, $ 4, cl. 1, and the Court therefore hasrecognized that States retain the power to regulate their
own elections. Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 U. S. 634, 647
(1973); Tashjian v. Republican Party of Connecticut, 479
U. S. 208, 217 (1986). Common sense, as well as constitutional law, compels the conclusion that government must play
an active role in structuring elections; "as a practical matter,
there must be a substantial regulation of elections if they
are to be fair and honest and if some sort of order, rather
than chaos, is to accompany the democratic processes."
Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724, 730 (1974).

Election laws will invariably impose some burden upon individual voters. Each provision of a code, "whether it governs the registration and qualifications of voters, the selection and eligibility of candidates, or the voting process itself,
inevitably affects--at least to some degree--the individual's
right to vote and his right to associate with others for political ends." Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 788 (1983).
Consequently, to subject every voting regulation to strict
scrutiny and to require that the regulation be narrowly tailored to advance a compelling state interest, as petitioner
suggests, would tie the hands of States seeking to assure
that elections are operated equitably and efficiently. See
Brief for Petitioner 32-37. Accordingly, the mere fact that
a State's system "creates barriers . . . tending to limit the
field of candidates from which voters might choose . . . does
not of itself compel close scrutiny." Bullock v. Carter, 405

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 134, 143 (1972); Anderson, supra, at 788; McDonald v.Board of Election Comm'rs of Chicago, 394 U. S. 802 (1969).

Instead, as the full Court agreed in Anderson, 460 U. S., at788-789; id., at 808, 817 (

Rehnquist, J., dissenting), a moreflexible standard applies. A court considering a challenge

to a state election law must weigh "the character and magni-tude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the
First and Fourteenth Amendments that the plaintiff seeksto vindicate" against "the precise interests put forward by
the State as justifications for the burden imposed by itsrule," taking into consideration "the extent to which those
interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiff 's rights."
Id., at 789; Tashjian, supra, at 213-214.Under this standard, the rigorousness of our inquiry into

the propriety of a state election law depends upon the extentto which a challenged regulation burdens First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Thus, as we have recognizedwhen those rights are subjected to "severe" restrictions, the
regulation must be "narrowly drawn to advance a state in-terest of compelling importance."

Norman v. Reed, 502U. S. 279, 289 (1992). But when a state election law provision imposes only "reasonable, nondiscriminatory restric-tions" upon the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of
voters, "the State's important regulatory interests are gen-erally sufficient to justify" the restrictions. Anderson, 460
U. S., at 788; see also id., at 788-789, n. 9. We apply thisstandard in considering petitioner's challenge to Hawaii's
ban on write-in ballots. A

There is no doubt that the Hawaii election laws, like allelection regulations, have an impact on the right to vote,

id.,at 788, but it can hardly be said that the laws at issue here

unconstitutionally limit access to the ballot by party or inde-pendent candidates or unreasonably interfere with the right
of voters to associate and have candidates of their choiceplaced on the ballot. Indeed, petitioner understandably does

Opinion of the Court
not challenge the manner in which the State regulates candidate access to the ballot.

To obtain a position on the November general election ballot, a candidate must participate in Hawaii's open primary,
"in which all registered voters may choose in which party
primary to vote." Tashjian, supra, at 223, n. 11. See Haw.
Rev. Stat. $ 12-31 (1985). The State provides three mechanisms through which a voter's candidate-of-choice may appear on the primary ballot.

First, a party petition may be filed 150 days before the
primary by any group of persons who obtain the signatures
of one percent of the State's registered voters.3 Haw. Rev.
Stat. $ 11-62 (Supp. 1991). Then, 60 days before the primary, candidates must file nominating papers certifying,
among other things, that they will qualify for the office
sought and that they are members of the party that they
seek to represent in the general election. The nominating
papers must contain the signatures of a specified number of
registered voters: 25 for candidates for statewide or federal
office; 15 for state legislative and county races. Haw. Rev.
Stat. $$ 12-2.5 to 12-7 (1985 and Supp. 1991). The winner
in each party advances to the general election. Thus, if a
party forms around the candidacy of a single individual and
no one else runs on that party ticket, the individual will be
elected at the primary and win a place on the November
general election ballot.

The second method through which candidates may appear
on the Hawaii primary ballot is the established party route.4

3 We have previously upheld party and candidate petition signature requirements that were as burdensome or more burdensome than Hawaii's
one-percent requirement. See, e. g., Norman v. Reed, 502 U. S. 279, 295
(1992); American Party of Texas v. White, 415 U. S. 767 (1974); Jenness v.
Fortson, 403 U. S. 431 (1971).

4 In Jenness, we rejected an equal protection challenge to a system that

provided alternative means of ballot access for members of established
political parties and other candidates, concluding that the system was con504us2$81D 04-08-96 07:08:40 PAGES OPINPGT
436 BURDICK v. TAKUSHI

Opinion of the Court
Established parties that have qualified by petition for threeconsecutive elections and received a specified percentage of

the vote in the preceding election may avoid filing party peti-tions for 10 years. Haw. Rev. Stat. $ 11-61 (1985). The
Democratic, Republican, and Libertarian Parties currentlymeet Hawaii's criteria for established parties. Like new
party candidates, established party contenders are requiredto file nominating papers 60 days before the primary. Haw.
Rev. Stat. $$ 12-2.5 to 12-7 (1985 and Supp. 1991).5The third mechanism by which a candidate may appear
on the ballot is through the designated nonpartisan ballot.Nonpartisans may be placed on the nonpartisan primary ballot simply by filing nominating papers containing 15 to 25signatures, depending upon the office sought, 60 days before
the primary. $$ 12-3 to 12-7. To advance to the generalelection, a nonpartisan must receive 10 percent of the primary vote or the number of votes that was sufficient to nomi-nate a partisan candidate, whichever number is lower. Hustace v. Doi, 60 Haw. 282, 289-290, 588 P. 2d 915, 920 (1978).During the 10 years preceding the filing of this action, 8 of
26 nonpartisans who entered the primary obtained slots onthe November ballot. Brief for Respondents 8.

Although Hawaii makes no provision for write-in voting inits primary or general elections, the system outlined above
provides for easy access to the ballot until the cutoff datefor the filing of nominating petitions, two months before the
primary. Consequently, any burden on voters' freedom ofchoice and association is borne only by those who fail to idenstitutional because it did not operate to freeze the political status quo.
403 U. S., at 438.

5 In Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780 (1983), the Court concluded

that Ohio's early filing deadline for Presidential candidates imposed an
unconstitutional burden on voters' freedom of choice and freedom of association. But Anderson is distinguishable because the Ohio election scheme,
as explained by the Court, provided no means for a candidate to appear
on the ballot after a March cutoff date. Id., at 786. Hawaii fills this void
through its nonpartisan primary ballot mechanism.

tify their candidate of choice until days before the primary.But in Storer v. Brown, we gave little weight to "the interest

the candidate and his supporters may have in making a laterather than an early decision to seek independent ballot status." 415 U. S., at 736.6 Cf. Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410U. S. 752, 757 (1973). We think the same reasoning applies
here and therefore conclude that any burden imposed byHawaii's write-in vote prohibition is a very limited one. "To
conclude otherwise might sacrifice the political stability ofthe system of the State, with profound consequences for the
entire citizenry, merely in the interest of particular candi-dates and their supporters having instantaneous access to
the ballot." Storer, supra, at 736.7Because he has characterized this as a voting rights rather
than ballot access case, petitioner submits that the write-inprohibition deprives him of the opportunity to cast a meaningful ballot, conditions his electoral participation upon the

6 In Storer, we upheld a California ballot access law that refused to recognize independent candidates until a year after they had disaffiliated
from a political party.

7 The dissent complains that, because primary voters are required to opt

for a specific partisan or nonpartisan ballot, they are foreclosed from voting in those races in which no candidate appears on their chosen ballot
and in those races in which they are dissatisfied with the available choices.
Post, at 444. But this is generally true of primaries; voters are required
to select a ticket, rather than choose from the universe of candidates running on all party slates. Indeed, the Court has upheld the much more
onerous requirement that voters interested in participating in a primary
election enroll as a member of a political party prior to the preceding
general election. Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U. S. 752 (1973). Cf. American Party of Texas, supra, at 786 ("[T]he State may determine that it is
essential to the integrity of the nominating [petition] process to confine
voters to supporting one party and its candidates in the course of the same
nominating process").

If the dissent were correct in suggesting that requiring primary voters
to select a specific ballot impermissibly burdened the right to vote, it is
clear under our decisions that the availability of a write-in option would
not provide an adequate remedy. Anderson, supra, at 799, n. 26; Lubin

At bottom, he claims that he is entitled to cast and Hawaiirequired to count a "protest vote" for Donald Duck, Tr. of
Oral Arg. 5, and that any impediment to this asserted "right"is unconstitutional.

Petitioner's argument is based on two flawed premises.First, in

Bullock v. Carter, we minimized the extent to whichvoting rights cases are distinguishable from ballot access

cases, stating that "the rights of voters and the rights ofcandidates do not lend themselves to neat separation." 405
U. S., at 143.8 Second, the function of the election processis "to winnow out and finally reject all but the chosen candidates," Storer, 415 U. S., at 735, not to provide a means ofgiving vent to "short-range political goals, pique, or personal
quarrel[s]." Ibid. Attributing to elections a more general-ized expressive function would undermine the ability of
States to operate elections fairly and efficiently. Id., at 730.Accordingly, we have repeatedly upheld reasonable, politically neutral regulations that have the effect of channelingexpressive activity at the polls. See

Munro, 479 U. S., at199. Petitioner offers no persuasive reason to depart from

these precedents. Reasonable regulation of elections does
not require voters to espouse positions that they do not sup-port; it does require them to act in a timely fashion if they

wish to express their views in the voting booth. And thereis nothing content based about a flat ban on all forms of
write-in ballots.The appropriate standard for evaluating a claim that a
state law burdens the right to vote is set forth in Anderson.Applying that standard, we conclude that, in light of the adequate ballot access afforded under Hawaii's election code, the

Opinion of the Court
State's ban on write-in voting imposes only a limited burdenon voters' rights to make free choices and to associate politically through the vote. B

We turn next to the interests asserted by Hawaii to justifythe burden imposed by its prohibition of write-in voting. Because we have already concluded that the burden is slight,the State need not establish a compelling interest to tip the
constitutional scales in its direction. Here, the State's inter-ests outweigh petitioner's limited interest in waiting until
the eleventh hour to choose his preferred candidate.Hawaii's interest in "avoid[ing] the possibility of unrestrained factionalism at the general election," Munro, supra,at 196, provides adequate justification for its ban on write-in
voting in November. The primary election is "an integralpart of the entire election process,"

Storer, 415 U. S., at 735,and the State is within its rights to reserve "[t]he general

election ballot . . . for major struggles . . . [and] not a forumfor continuing intraparty feuds."

Ibid.; Munro, supra, at196, 199. The prohibition on write-in voting is a legitimate

means of averting divisive sore-loser candidacies. Hawaiifurther promotes the two-stage, primary-general election
process of winnowing out candidates, see Storer, supra, at735, by permitting the unopposed victors in certain primaries to be designated officeholders. See Haw. Rev. Stat.$$ 12-41, 12-42 (1985). This focuses the attention of voters
upon contested races in the general election. This wouldnot be possible, absent the write-in voting ban.

Hawaii also asserts that its ban on write-in voting at theprimary stage is necessary to guard against "party raiding."
Tashjian, 479 U. S., at 219. Party raiding is generally de-fined as "the organized switching of blocs of voters from one
party to another in order to manipulate the outcome of theother party's primary election." Anderson, 460 U. S., at
789, n. 9. Petitioner suggests that, because Hawaii conductsan open primary, this is not a cognizable interest. We dis504us2$81D 04-08-96 07:08:40 PAGES OPINPGT
440 BURDICK v. TAKUSHI

Opinion of the Court
agree. While voters may vote on any ticket in Hawaii's
primary, the State requires that party candidates be "member[s] of the party," Haw. Rev. Stat. $ 12-3(a)(7) (1985), and
prohibits candidates from filing "nomination papers both as
a party candidate and as a nonpartisan candidate," $ 12-3(c).
Hawaii's system could easily be circumvented in a party primary election by mounting a write-in campaign for a person
who had not filed in time or who had never intended to run
for election. It could also be frustrated at the general election by permitting write-in votes for a loser in a party primary or for an independent who had failed to get sufficient
votes to make the general election ballot. The State has a
legitimate interest in preventing these sorts of maneuvers,
and the write-in voting ban is a reasonable way of accomplishing this goal.9

We think these legitimate interests asserted by the State
are sufficient to outweigh the limited burden that the writein voting ban imposes upon Hawaii's voters.10

9 The State also supports its ban on write-in voting as a means of enforcing nominating requirements, combating fraud, and "fostering informed
and educated expressions of the popular will." Anderson, 460 U. S., at 796.

10 Although the dissent purports to agree with the standard we apply in

determining whether the right to vote has been restricted, post, at 445-
446, and implies that it is analyzing the write-in ban under some minimal
level of scrutiny, post, at 448, the dissent actually employs strict scrutiny.
This is evident from its invocation of quite rigid narrow tailoring requirements. For instance, the dissent argues that the State could adopt a less
drastic means of preventing sore-loser candidacies, ibid., and that the
State could screen out ineligible candidates through postelection disqualification rather than a write-in voting ban. Post, at 450.

It seems to us that limiting the choice of candidates to those who have
complied with state election law requirements is the prototypical example
of a regulation that, while it affects the right to vote, is eminently reasonable. Anderson, supra, at 788. The dissent's suggestion that voters are
entitled to cast their ballots for unqualified candidates appears to be
driven by the assumption that an election system that imposes any restraint on voter choice is unconstitutional. This is simply wrong. See
supra, at 433-434.

Opinion of the Court

III
Indeed, the foregoing leads us to conclude that when a
State's ballot access laws pass constitutional muster as
imposing only reasonable burdens on First and Fourteenth
Amendment rights--as do Hawaii's election laws--a prohibition on write-in voting will be presumptively valid, since any
burden on the right to vote for the candidate of one's choice
will be light and normally will be counterbalanced by the
very state interests supporting the ballot access scheme.

In such situations, the objection to the specific ban on
write-in voting amounts to nothing more than the insistence
that the State record, count, and publish individual protests
against the election system or the choices presented on the
ballot through the efforts of those who actively participate
in the system. There are other means available, however,
to voice such generalized dissension from the electoral process; and we discern no adequate basis for our requiring the
State to provide and to finance a place on the ballot for recording protests against its constitutionally valid election
laws.11

"No right is more precious in a free country than that of
having a voice in the election of those who make the laws
under which, as good citizens, we must live." Wesberry v.
Sanders, 376 U. S. 1, 17 (1964). But the right to vote is the
right to participate in an electoral process that is necessarily
structured to maintain the integrity of the democratic system. Anderson, supra, at 788; Storer, 415 U. S., at 730. We
think that Hawaii's prohibition on write-in voting, considered
as part of an electoral scheme that provides constitutionally
sufficient ballot access, does not impose an unconstitutional
burden upon the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of

11 We of course in no way suggest that a State is not free to provide for
write-in voting, as many States do; nor should this opinion be read to
discourage such provisions.

the State's voters. Accordingly, the judgment of the Courtof Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Blackmun and
Justice Stevens join, dissenting.

The question before us is whether Hawaii can enact a total
ban on write-in voting. The majority holds that it can, find-ing that Hawaii's ballot access rules impose no serious limitations on the right to vote. Indeed, the majority in effectadopts a presumption that prohibitions on write-in voting
are permissible if the State's ballot access laws meet consti-tutional standards. I dissent because I disagree with the
presumption, as well as the majority's specific conclusion thatHawaii's ban on write-in voting is constitutional.

The record demonstrates the significant burden that
Hawaii's write-in ban imposes on the right of voters such as
petitioner to vote for the candidates of their choice. In the
election that triggered this lawsuit, petitioner did not wish
to vote for the one candidate who ran for state representative in his district. Because he could not write in the name
of a candidate he preferred, he had no way to cast a meaningful vote. Petitioner's dilemma is a recurring, frequent phenomenon in Hawaii because of the State's ballot access rules
and the circumstance that one party, the Democratic Party,
is predominant. It is critical to understand that petitioner's
case is not an isolated example of a restriction on the free
choice of candidates. The very ballot access rules the Court
cites as mitigating his injury in fact compound it systemwide.

Democratic candidates often run unopposed, especially in
state legislative races. In the 1986 general election, 33
percent of the elections for state legislative offices involved
single candidate races. Reply Brief for Petitioner 2-3, n. 2.
The comparable figures for 1984 and 1982 were 39 percent
and 37.5 percent. Ibid. Large numbers of voters cast

blank ballots in uncontested races, that is, they leave theballots blank rather than vote for the single candidate listed.

In 1990, 27 percent of voters who voted in other races didnot cast votes in uncontested state Senate races. Brief for
Common Cause/Hawaii as Amicus Curiae 15-16. Twentynine percent of voters did not cast votes in uncontested stateHouse races.

Id., at 16. Even in contested races in 1990,
12 to 13 percent of voters cast blank ballots. Id., at 16-17.Given that so many Hawaii voters are dissatisfied with the

choices available to them, it is hard to avoid the conclusionthat at least some voters would cast write-in votes for other
candidates if given this option. The write-in ban thus prevents these voters from participating in Hawaii elections in
a meaningful manner.

This evidence also belies the majority's suggestion that
Hawaii voters are presented with adequate electoral choices
because Hawaii makes it easy to get on the official ballot.
To the contrary, Hawaii's ballot access laws taken as a whole
impose a significant impediment to third-party or independent candidacies. The majority suggests that it is easy for
new parties to petition for a place on the primary ballot because they must obtain the signatures of only one percent
of the State's registered voters. This ignores the difficulty
presented by the early deadline for gathering these signatures: 150 days (5 months) before the primary election. Meeting this deadline requires considerable organization at an
early stage in the election, a condition difficult for many
small parties to meet. See Brief for Socialist Workers Party
as Amicus Curiae 10-11, n. 4.

If the party petition is unsuccessful or not completed in
time, or if a candidate does not wish to be affiliated with a
party, he may run as an independent. While the requirements to get on the nonpartisan ballot are not onerous (15
to 25 signatures, 60 days before the primary), the nonpartisan ballot presents voters with a difficult choice. This
is because each primary voter can choose only a single ballot

Kennedy, J., dissenting
for all offices. Hence, a voter who wishes to vote for anindependent candidate for one office must forgo the opportunity to vote in an established party primary in every otherrace. Since there might be no independent candidates for
most of the other offices, in practical terms the voter who
wants to vote for one independent candidate forfeits theright to participate in the selection of candidates for all other

offices. This rule, the very ballot access rule that the Courtfinds to be curative, in fact presents a substantial disincentive for voters to select the nonpartisan ballot. A voter whowishes to vote for a third-party candidate for only one particular office faces a similar disincentive to select the third party's ballot.

The dominance of the Democratic Party magnifies the disincentive because the primary election is dispositive in so
many races. In effect, a Hawaii voter who wishes to vote
for any independent candidate must choose between doing so
and participating in what will be the dispositive election for
many offices. This dilemma imposes a substantial burden
on voter choice. It explains also why so few independent
candidates secure enough primary votes to advance to the
general election. As the majority notes, only eight independent candidates have succeeded in advancing to the general election in the past 10 years. That is, less than one
independent candidate per year on average has in fact run
in a general election in Hawaii.

The majority's approval of Hawaii's ban is ironic at a time
when the new democracies in foreign countries strive to
emerge from an era of sham elections in which the name of
the ruling party candidate was the only one on the ballot.
Hawaii does not impose as severe a restriction on the right
to vote, but it imposes a restriction that has a haunting similarity in its tendency to exact severe penalties for one who
does anything but vote the dominant party ballot.

Aside from constraints related to ballot access restrictions,
the write-in ban limits voter choice in another way. Write504us2$81D 04-08-96 07:08:40 PAGES OPINPGT

in voting can serve as an important safety mechanism inthose instances where a late-developing issue arises or where

new information is disclosed about a candidate late in therace. In these situations, voters may become disenchanted
with the available candidates when it is too late for other
candidates to come forward and qualify for the ballot. Theprohibition on write-in voting imposes a significant burden

on voters, forcing them either to vote for a candidate whomthey no longer support or to cast a blank ballot. Write-in
voting provides a way out of the quandary, allowing votersto switch their support to candidates who are not on the
official ballot. Even if there are other mechanisms to address the problem of late-breaking election developments
(unsuitable candidates who win an election can be recalled),
allowing write-in voting is the only way to preserve the voters' right to cast a meaningful vote in the general election.

With this background, I turn to the legal principles that
control this case. At the outset, I agree with the first premise in the majority's legal analysis. The right at stake here
is the right to cast a meaningful vote for the candidate of
one's choice. Petitioner's right to freedom of expression is
not implicated. His argument that the First Amendment
confers upon citizens the right to cast a protest vote and to
have government officials count and report this vote is not
persuasive. As the majority points out, the purpose of casting, counting, and recording votes is to elect public officials,
not to serve as a general forum for political expression.

I agree as well with the careful statement the Court gives
of the test to be applied in this case to determine if the right
to vote has been constricted. As the Court phrases it, we
must "weigh `the character and magnitude of the asserted
injury to the rights protected by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate' against
`the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule,' taking into consideration `the extent to which those interests make it neces504us2$81D 04-08-96 07:08:40 PAGES OPINPGT

sary to burden the plaintiff 's rights.' " Ante, at 434, quoting
Tashjian v. Republican Party of Connecticut, 479 U. S. 208,
213-214 (1986). I submit the conclusion must be that thewrite-in ban deprives some voters of any substantial voice

in selecting candidates for the entire range of offices at issue
in a particular election.As a starting point, it is useful to remember that until the

late 1800's, all ballots cast in this country were write-in bal-lots. The system of state-prepared ballots, also known as
the Australian ballot system, was introduced in this countryin 1888. See L. E. Fredman, The Australian Ballot: The
Story of an American Reform ix (1968). Prior to this, voters
prepared their own ballots or used preprinted tickets offered
by political parties. Since there were no state-imposed restrictions on whose name could appear on a ballot, individuals could always vote for the candidates of their choice.

State-prepared ballots were considered to be a progressive
reform to reduce fraudulent election practices. The preprinted ballots offered by political parties had often been in
distinctive colors so that the party could determine whether
one who had sold his vote had used the right ballot. Id., at
22. The disadvantage of the new ballot system was that it
could operate to constrict voter choice. In recognition of
this problem, several early state courts recognized a right to
cast write-in votes. See, e. g., Sanner v. Patton, 155 Ill. 553,
562-564, 40 N. E. 290, 292-293 (1895) ("[I]f the construction
contended for by appellee [prohibiting write-in voting] be the
correct one, the voter is deprived of the constitutional right
of suffrage; he is deprived of the right of exercising his own
choice; and where this right is taken away there is nothing
left worthy of the name of the right of suffrage--the boasted
free ballot becomes a delusion"); Patterson v. Hanley, 136
Cal. 265, 270, 68 P. 821, 823 (1902) ("Under every form of
ballot of which we have had any experience the voter has
been allowed--and it seems to be agreed that he must be
allowed--the privilege of casting his vote for any person for

Kennedy, J., dissenting
any office by writing his name in the proper place"); and
Oughton v. Black, 212 Pa. 1, 6-7, 61 A. 346, 348 (1905) ("Unless there was such provision to enable the voter, not satis-fied to vote any ticket on the ballot, or for any names appearing on it, to make up an entire ticket of his own choice, the
election as to him would not be equal, for he would not beable to express his own individual will in his own way").

As these courts recognized, some voters cannot vote forthe candidate of their choice without a write-in option. In
effect, a write-in ban, in conjunction with other restrictions,can deprive the voter of the opportunity to cast a meaningful
ballot. As a consequence, write-in prohibitions can impose
a significant burden on voting rights. See Reynolds v.
Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 555 (1964) ("The right to vote freely for
the candidate of one's choice is of the essence of a democratic
society, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart
of representative government"). For those who are affected
by write-in bans, the infringement on their right to vote for
the candidate of their choice is total. The fact that writein candidates are longshots more often than not makes no
difference; the right to vote for one's preferred candidate
exists regardless of the likelihood that the candidate will be
successful. Socialist Labor Party v. Rhodes, 290 F. Supp.
983, 987 (SD Ohio) ("A write-in ballot permits a voter to
effectively exercise his individual constitutionally protected
franchise. The use of write-in ballots does not and should
not be dependent on the candidate's chance of success"), aff 'd
in part, modified in part sub nom. Williams v. Rhodes, 393
U. S. 23 (1968).

Based on the foregoing reasoning, I cannot accept the majority's presumption that write-in bans are permissible if the
State's ballot access laws are otherwise constitutional. The
presumption is circular, for it fails to take into account that
we must consider the availability of write-in voting, or the
lack thereof, as a factor in determining whether a State's
ballot access laws considered as a whole are constitutional.

Jenness v. Fortson, 403 U. S. 431, 438 (1971); Storer v. Brown,415 U. S. 724, 736, n. 7 (1974). The effect of the presumption, moreover, is to excuse a State from having to justify ordefend any write-in ban. Under the majority's view, a
write-in ban only has constitutional implications when the
State's ballot access scheme is defective and write-in votingwould remedy the defect. This means that the State needs

to defend only its ballot access laws, and not the write-inrestriction itself.

The majority's analysis ignores the inevitable and signifi-cant burden a write-in ban imposes upon some individual
voters by preventing them from exercising their right to
vote in a meaningful manner. The liberality of a State's ballot access laws is one determinant of the extent of the burden
imposed by the write-in ban; it is not, though, an automatic
excuse for forbidding all write-in voting. In my view, a
State that bans write-in voting in some or all elections must
justify the burden on individual voters by putting forth the
precise interests that are served by the ban. A write-in
prohibition should not be presumed valid in the absence of
any proffered justification by the State. The standard the
Court derives from Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780
(1983), means at least this.

Because Hawaii's write-in ban, when considered in conjunction with the State's ballot access laws, imposes a significant burden on voters such as petitioner, it must put forward the state interests which justify the burden so that we
can assess them. I do not think it necessary here to specify
the level of scrutiny that should then be applied because, in
my view, the State has failed to justify the write-in ban
under any level of scrutiny. The interests proffered by the
State, some of which are puzzling, are not advanced to any
significant degree by the write-in prohibition. I consider
each of the interests in turn.

The interest that has the best potential for acceptance, in
my view, is that of preserving the integrity of party pri504us2$81D 04-08-96 07:08:40 PAGES OPINPGT

449Cite as: 504 U. S. 428 (1992)
Kennedy, J., dissenting
maries by preventing sore loser candidacies during the gen-eral election. As the majority points out, we have acknowledged the State's interest in avoiding party factionalism. Awrite-in ban does serve this interest to some degree by eliminating one mechanism which could be used by sore loser
candidates. But I do not agree that this interest provides"adequate justification" for the ban.

Ante, at 439. As an
initial matter, the interest can at best justify the write-inprohibition for general elections; it cannot justify Hawaii's

complete ban in both the primary and the general election.And with respect to general elections, a write-in ban is a
very overinclusive means of addressing the problem; it bars
legitimate candidacies as well as undesirable sore loser
candidacies. If the State desires to prevent sore loser candidacies, it can implement a narrow provision aimed at that
particular problem.

The second interest advanced by the State is enforcing its
policy of permitting the unopposed victors in certain primaries to be designated as officeholders without having to
go through the general election. The majority states that
"[t]his would not be possible, absent the write-in voting ban."
Ibid. This makes no sense. As petitioner's counsel acknowledged during oral argument, "[t]o the degree that
Hawaii has abolished general elections in these circumstances, there is no occasion to cast a write-in ballot." Tr.
of Oral Arg. 14. If anything, the argument cuts the other
way because this provision makes it all the more important
to allow write-in voting in the primary elections because primaries are often dispositive.

Hawaii justifies its write-in ban in primary elections as a
way to prevent party raiding. Petitioner argues that this
alleged interest is suspect because the State created the
party raiding problem in the first place by allowing open
primaries. I agree. It is ironic for the State to raise this
concern when the risk of party raiding is a feature of the
open primary system the State has chosen. The majority

504us2$81D 04-08-96 07:08:40 PAGES OPINPGT
450 BURDICK v. TAKUSHI

Kennedy, J., dissenting
suggests that write-in voting presents a particular risk ofcircumventing the primary system because state law requires candidates in party primaries to be members of theparty. Again, the majority's argument is not persuasive.
If write-in voters mount a campaign for a candidate who doesnot meet state-law requirements, the candidate would be disqualified from the election.The State also cites its interest in promoting the informed
selection of candidates, an interest it claims is advanced by"flushing candidates into the open a reasonable time before
the election." Brief for Respondents 44. I think the Statehas it backwards. The fact that write-in candidates often
do not conduct visible campaigns seems to me to make itmore likely that voters who go to the trouble of seeking out
these candidates and writing in their names are well in-formed. The state interest may well cut the other way.

The State cites interests in combating fraud and enforcingnomination requirements. But the State does not explain
how write-in voting presents a risk of fraud in today's pollingplaces. As to the State's interest in making sure that ineligible candidates are not elected, petitioner's counsel pointedout at argument that approximately 20 States require writein candidates to file a declaration of candidacy and verify thatthey are eligible to hold office a few days before the election.
Tr. of Oral Arg. 13.In sum, the State's proffered justifications for the write-in
prohibition are not sufficient under any standard to justifythe significant impairment of the constitutional rights of voters such as petitioner. I would grant him relief.

EASTMAN KODAK CO. v. IMAGE TECHNICAL SERVICES, INC., et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 90-1029. Argued December 10, 1991--Decided June 8, 1992
After respondent independent service organizations (ISO's) began servicing copying and micrographic equipment manufactured by petitioner
Eastman Kodak Co., Kodak adopted policies to limit the availability to
ISO's of replacement parts for its equipment and to make it more difficult for ISO's to compete with it in servicing such equipment. Respondents then filed this action, alleging, inter alia, that Kodak had unlawfully tied the sale of service for its machines to the sale of parts, in
violation of $ 1 of the Sherman Act, and had unlawfully monopolized and
attempted to monopolize the sale of service and parts for such machines,
in violation of $ 2 of that Act. The District Court granted summary
judgment for Kodak, but the Court of Appeals reversed. Among other
things, the appellate court found that respondents had presented sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue concerning Kodak's market power
in the service and parts markets, and rejected Kodak's contention that
lack of market power in service and parts must be assumed when such
power is absent in the equipment market.

Held:

1. Kodak has not met the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 56(c) for an award of summary judgment on the $ 1 claim.
Pp. 461-479.

(a) A tying arrangement--i. e., an agreement by a party to sell one
product on the condition that the buyer also purchases a different (or
tied) product, or at least agrees that he will not purchase that product
from any other supplier--violates $ 1 only if the seller has appreciable
economic power in the tying product market. Pp. 461-462.

(b) Respondents have presented sufficient evidence of a tying arrangement to defeat a summary judgment motion. A reasonable trier
of fact could find, first, that service and parts are two distinct products
in light of evidence indicating that each has been, and continues in some
circumstances to be, sold separately, and, second, that Kodak has tied
the sale of the two products in light of evidence indicating that it would
sell parts to third parties only if they agreed not to buy service from
ISO's. Pp. 462-463.

452 EASTMAN KODAK CO. v. IMAGE TECHNICAL

SERVICES, INC.

Syllabus

(c) For purposes of determining appreciable economic power in the
tying market, this Court's precedents have defined market power as the
power to force a purchaser to do something that he would not do in a
competitive market, and have ordinarily inferred the existence of such
power from the seller's possession of a predominant share of the market. P. 464.

(d) Respondents would be entitled under such precedents to a trial
on their claim that Kodak has sufficient power in the parts market to
force unwanted purchases of the tied service market, based on evidence
indicating that Kodak has control over the availability of parts and that
such control has excluded service competition, boosted service prices,
and forced unwilling consumption of Kodak service. Pp. 464-465.

(e) Kodak has not satisfied its substantial burden of showing that,
despite such evidence, an inference of market power is unreasonable.
Kodak's theory that its lack of market power in the primary equipment
market precludes--as a matter of law--the possibility of market power
in the derivative aftermarkets rests on the factual assumption that if
it raised its parts or service prices above competitive levels, potential
customers would simply stop buying its equipment. Kodak's theory
does not accurately describe actual market behavior, since there is no
evidence or assertion that its equipment sales dropped after it raised
its service prices. Respondents offer a forceful reason for this discrepancy: the existence of significant information and switching costs
that could create a less responsive connection between aftermarket
prices and equipment sales. It is plausible to infer from respondents'
evidence that Kodak chose to gain immediate profits by exerting market
power where locked-in customers, high information costs, and discriminatory pricing limited, and perhaps eliminated, any long-term loss.
Pp. 465-478.

(f) Nor is this Court persuaded by Kodak's contention that it is
entitled to a legal presumption on the lack of market power because
there is a significant risk of deterring procompetitive conduct. Because
Kodak's service and parts policy is not one that appears always, or almost always, to enhance competition, the balance tips against summary
judgment. Pp. 478-479.

2. Respondents have presented genuine issues for trial as to whether
Kodak has monopolized, or attempted to monopolize, the service and
parts markets in violation of $ 2. Pp. 480-486.

(a) Respondents' evidence that Kodak controls nearly 100% of the
parts market and 80% to 95% of the service market, with no readily
available substitutes, is sufficient to survive summary judgment on the
first element of the monopoly offense, the possession of monopoly power.
Kodak's contention that, as a matter of law, a single brand of a product

or service can never be a relevant market contravenes cases of this
Court indicating that one brand of a product can constitute a separate
market in some instances. The proper market definition in this case
can be determined only after a factual inquiry into the commercial realities faced by Kodak equipment owners. Pp. 481-482.

(b) As to the second element of a $ 2 claim, the willful use of monopoly power, respondents have presented evidence that Kodak took exclusionary action to maintain its parts monopoly and used its control over
parts to strengthen its monopoly share of the service market. Thus,
liability turns on whether valid business reasons can explain Kodak's
actions. However, none of its asserted business justifications--a commitment to quality service, a need to control inventory costs, and a desire to prevent ISO's from free-riding on its capital investment--are
sufficient to prove that it is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.
Pp. 482-486.

Opinion of the Court

Respondents instituted this action in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Kodak's policies were unlawful under both $ 1 and$ 2 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U. S. C.

$$ 1 and 2 (1988 ed., Supp. II). After truncated discovery,the District Court granted summary judgment for Kodak.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. Theappellate court found that respondents had presented sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue concerning Kodak'smarket power in the service and parts markets. It rejected
Kodak's contention that lack of market power in service andparts must be assumed when such power is absent in the
equipment market. Because of the importance of the issue,we granted certiorari. 501 U. S. 1216 (1991).

graphic software programs that operate on Kodak machines,
for example, are not compatible with competitors' machines.
See App. 424-425, 487-489, 537. Kodak parts are not compatible with other manufacturers' equipment, and vice versa.
See id., at 432, 413-415. Kodak equipment, although expensive when new, has little resale value. See id., at 358-359,
424-425, 427-428, 467, 505-506, 519-521.

Kodak provides service and parts for its machines to its
customers. It produces some of the parts itself; the rest are
made to order for Kodak by independent original-equipment
manufacturers (OEM's). See id., at 429, 465, 490, 496.
Kodak does not sell a complete system of original equipment,
lifetime service, and lifetime parts for a single price. Instead, Kodak provides service after the initial warranty period either through annual service contracts, which include
all necessary parts, or on a per-call basis. See id., at 98-99;
Brief for Petitioner 3. It charges, through negotiations and
bidding, different prices for equipment, service, and parts
for different customers. See App. 420-421, 536. Kodak
provides 80% to 95% of the service for Kodak machines.
See id., at 430.

Beginning in the early 1980's, ISO's began repairing and
servicing Kodak equipment. They also sold parts and reconditioned and sold used Kodak equipment. Their customers were federal, state, and local government agencies,

SERVICES, INC.

Opinion of the Court

Some ISO customers purchase their own parts and hireISO's only for service. See Lodging 144-147. Others

choose ISO's to supply both service and parts. See id., at133. ISO's keep an inventory of parts, purchased from
Kodak or other sources, primarily the OEM's.2 See App. 99,415-416, 490.

In 1985 and 1986, Kodak implemented a policy of sellingreplacement parts for micrographic and copying machines
only to buyers of Kodak equipment who use Kodak serviceor repair their own machines. See Brief for Petitioner 6;
App. 91-92, 98-100, 140-141, 171-172, 190, 442-447, 455-456, 483-484.

As part of the same policy, Kodak sought to limit ISO ac-cess to other sources of Kodak parts. Kodak and the OEM's
agreed that the OEM's would not sell parts that fit Kodakequipment to anyone other than Kodak. See id., at 417,
428-429, 447, 468, 474, 496. Kodak also pressured Kodakequipment owners and independent parts distributors not to
sell Kodak parts to ISO's. See id., at 419-420, 428-429, 483-484, 517-518, 589-590. In addition, Kodak took steps to restrict the availability of used machines. See id., at 427-428,465-466, 510-511, 520.

Kodak intended, through these policies, to make it moredifficult for ISO's to sell service for Kodak machines. See
id., at 106-107, 171, 516. It succeeded. ISO's were unableto obtain parts from reliable sources, see

id., at 429, 468,496, and many were forced out of business, while others lost

substantial revenue. See id., at 422, 458-459, 464, 468, 475-477, 482-484, 495-496, 501, 521. Customers were forced to
switch to Kodak service even though they preferred ISOservice. See

id., at 420-422.

2 In addition to the OEM's, other sources of Kodak parts include (1)
brokers who would buy parts from Kodak, or strip used Kodak equipment
to obtain the useful parts and resell them, (2) customers who buy parts
from Kodak and make them available to ISO's, and (3) used equipment to
be stripped for parts. See id., at 419, 517; Brief for Petitioner 38.

Opinion of the Court

B
In 1987, the ISO's filed the present action in the District
Court, alleging, inter alia, that Kodak had unlawfully tied
the sale of service for Kodak machines to the sale of parts,
in violation of $ 1 of the Sherman Act, and had unlawfully
monopolized and attempted to monopolize the sale of service
for Kodak machines, in violation of $ 2 of that Act.3

Kodak filed a motion for summary judgment before respondents had initiated discovery. The District Court permitted respondents to file one set of interrogatories and one
set of requests for production of documents and to take six
depositions. Without a hearing, the District Court granted
summary judgment in favor of Kodak. App. to Pet. for
Cert. 29B.

As to the $ 1 claim, the court found that respondents had
provided no evidence of a tying arrangement between Kodak
equipment and service or parts. See id., at 32B-33B. The
court, however, did not address respondents' $ 1 claim that
is at issue here. Respondents allege a tying arrangement
not between Kodak equipment and service, but between
Kodak parts and service. As to the $ 2 claim, the District
Court concluded that although Kodak had a "natural monopoly over the market for parts it sells under its name," a unilateral refusal to sell those parts to ISO's did not violate $ 2.

3 Section 1 of the Sherman Act states in relevant part: "Every contract,
combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint
of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations,
is declared to be illegal." 15 U. S. C. $ 1 (1988 ed., Supp. II).

Section 2 of the Sherman Act states: "Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among
the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a
felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding
$10,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other person, $350,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by both said punishments, in the
discretion of the court." 15 U. S. C. $ 2 (1988 ed., Supp. II).

SERVICES, INC.

Opinion of the Court

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, by a divided
vote, reversed. 903 F. 2d 612 (1990). With respect to the

$ 1 claim, the court first found that whether service and parts
were distinct markets and whether a tying arrangement existed between them were disputed issues of fact. Id., at
615-616. Having found that a tying arrangement might
exist, the Court of Appeals considered a question not decided
by the District Court: Was there "an issue of material fact
as to whether Kodak has sufficient economic power in the
tying product market [parts] to restrain competition appreciably in the tied product market [service]." Id., at 616. The
court agreed with Kodak that competition in the equipment
market might prevent Kodak from possessing power in the
parts market, but refused to uphold the District Court's
grant of summary judgment "on this theoretical basis" because "market imperfections can keep economic theories
about how consumers will act from mirroring reality." Id.,
at 617. Noting that the District Court had not considered
the market power issue, and that the record was not fully
developed through discovery, the court declined to require
respondents to conduct market analysis or to pinpoint specific imperfections in order to withstand summary judgment.4 "It is enough that [respondents] have presented evidence of actual events from which a reasonable trier of fact
could conclude that . . . competition in the [equipment] market does not, in reality, curb Kodak's power in the parts market." Ibid.

4 Specifically, the Court of Appeals explained that the District Court had
denied the request for further discovery made by respondents in their
opposition to Kodak's summary judgment motion: "For example, [respondents] requested to depose two ISO customers who allegedly would not sign
accurate statements concerning Kodak's market power in the parts market. Not finding it necessary to reach the market power issue in its decision, the district court, of course, had no reason to grant this request."

Opinion of the Court
The court then considered the three business justificationsKodak proffered for its restrictive parts policy: (1) to guard

against inadequate service, (2) to lower inventory costs, and(3) to prevent ISO's from free-riding on Kodak's investment
in the copier and micrographic industry. The court con-cluded that the trier of fact might find the product quality
and inventory reasons to be pretextual and that there wasa less restrictive alternative for achieving Kodak's qualityrelated goals. Id., at 618-619. The court also found Ko-dak's third justification, preventing ISO's from profiting on
Kodak's investments in the equipment markets, legally insuf-ficient.

Id., at 619.As to the $ 2 claim, the Court of Appeals concluded that

sufficient evidence existed to support a finding that Kodak'simplementation of its parts policy was "anticompetitive" and
"exclusionary" and "involved a specific intent to monopolize."
Id., at 620. It held that the ISO's had come forward withsufficient evidence, for summary judgment purposes, to disprove Kodak's business justifications. Ibid.The dissent in the Court of Appeals, with respect to the

$ 1 claim, accepted Kodak's argument that evidence of com-petition in the equipment market "

necessarily precludespower in the derivative market." Id., at 622 (emphasis in

original). With respect to the $ 2 monopolization claim, thedissent concluded that, entirely apart from market power
considerations, Kodak was entitled to summary judgment onthe basis of its first business justification because it had "submitted extensive and undisputed evidence of a marketingstrategy based on high-quality service."

Id., at 623.

A tying arrangement is "an agreement by a party to sellone product but only on the condition that the buyer also

purchases a different (or tied) product, or at least agrees thathe will not purchase that product from any other supplier."

Opinion of the Court

(1958). Such an arrangement violates $ 1 of the ShermanAct if the seller has "appreciable economic power" in the

tying product market and if the arrangement affects asubstantial volume of commerce in the tied market. Fortner
Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., 394 U. S. 495,503 (1969).

Kodak did not dispute that its arrangement affects a sub-stantial volume of interstate commerce. It, however, did
challenge whether its activities constituted a "tying arrange-ment" and whether Kodak exercised "appreciable economic
power" in the tying market. We consider these issues inturn.

A
For respondents to defeat a motion for summary judgmenton their claim of a tying arrangement, a reasonable trier of

fact must be able to find, first, that service and parts are twodistinct products, and, second, that Kodak has tied the sale
of the two products.For service and parts to be considered two distinct products, there must be sufficient consumer demand so that it isefficient for a firm to provide service separately from parts.
Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U. S. 2,21-22 (1984). Evidence in the record indicates that service
and parts have been sold separately in the past and still aresold separately to self-service equipment owners.

5 Indeed,

the development of the entire high-technology service indus-try is evidence of the efficiency of a separate market for

service.6

5 The Court of Appeals found: "Kodak's policy of allowing customers to
purchase parts on condition that they agree to service their own machines
suggests that the demand for parts can be separated from the demand for
service." Id., at 616.

6 Amicus briefs filed by various service organizations attest to the magnitude of the service business. See, e. g., Brief for Computer Service Network International as Amicus Curiae; Brief for National Electronics
Sales and Service Dealers Association as Amicus Curiae; Brief for Cali504US2$82F 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT

463Cite as: 504 U. S. 451 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
Kodak insists that because there is no demand for parts
separate from service, there cannot be separate markets for
service and parts. Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 3. By that
logic, we would be forced to conclude that there can never
be separate markets, for example, for cameras and film, computers and software, or automobiles and tires. That is an
assumption we are unwilling to make. "We have often
found arrangements involving functionally linked products
at least one of which is useless without the other to be prohibited tying devices." Jefferson Parish, 466 U. S., at 19,
n. 30.

Kodak's assertion also appears to be incorrect as a factual
matter. At least some consumers would purchase service
without parts, because some service does not require parts,
and some consumers, those who self-service for example,
would purchase parts without service.7 Enough doubt is
cast on Kodak's claim of a unified market that it should be
resolved by the trier of fact.

Finally, respondents have presented sufficient evidence of
a tie between service and parts. The record indicates that
Kodak would sell parts to third parties only if they agreed
not to buy service from ISO's.8

fornia State Electronics Association et al. as Amici Curiae; Brief for National Office Machine Dealers et al. as Amici Curiae.

7 The dissent suggests that parts and service are not separate products

for tying purposes because all service may involve installation of parts.
Post, at 494-495, n. 2. Because the record does not support this factual
assertion, under the approach of both the Court and the concurrence in
Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U. S. 2 (1984), Kodak
is not entitled to summary judgment on whether parts and service are
distinct markets.

8 In a footnote, Kodak contends that this practice is only a unilateral

refusal to deal, which does not violate the antitrust laws. See Brief for
Petitioner 15, n. 4. Assuming, arguendo, that Kodak's refusal to sell parts
to any company providing service can be characterized as a unilateral
refusal to deal, its alleged sale of parts to third parties on condition that
they buy service from Kodak is not. See 903 F. 2d, at 619.

Opinion of the Court

B
Having found sufficient evidence of a tying arrangement,
we consider the other necessary feature of an illegal tyingarrangement: appreciable economic power in the tying market. Market power is the power "to force a purchaser to dosomething that he would not do in a competitive market."
Jefferson Parish, 466 U. S., at 14.9 It has been defined as"the ability of a single seller to raise price and restrict output." Fortner, 394 U. S., at 503; United States v. E. I. du
Pont de Nemours & Co., 351 U. S. 377, 391 (1956). The existence of such power ordinarily is inferred from the seller's
possession of a predominant share of the market. Jefferson
Parish, 466 U. S., at 17; United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384
U. S. 563, 571 (1966); Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v.
United States, 345 U. S. 594, 611-613 (1953).

1
Respondents contend that Kodak has more than sufficient
power in the parts market to force unwanted purchases of
the tied market, service. Respondents provide evidence
that certain parts are available exclusively through Kodak.
Respondents also assert that Kodak has control over the
availability of parts it does not manufacture. According to
respondents' evidence, Kodak has prohibited independent
manufacturers from selling Kodak parts to ISO's, pressured
Kodak equipment owners and independent parts distributors
to deny ISO's the purchase of Kodak parts, and taken steps
to restrict the availability of used machines.

9 "[T]he essential characteristic of an invalid tying arrangement lies in
the seller's exploitation of its control over the tying product to force the
buyer into the purchase of a tied product that the buyer either did not
want at all, or might have preferred to purchase elsewhere on different
terms. When such `forcing' is present, competition on the merits in the
market for the tied item is restrained and the Sherman Act is violated."
Jefferson Parish, 466 U. S., at 12.

465Cite as: 504 U. S. 451 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
Respondents also allege that Kodak's control over theparts market has excluded service competition, boosted

service prices, and forced unwilling consumption of Kodakservice. Respondents offer evidence that consumers have
switched to Kodak service even though they preferred ISOservice, that Kodak service was of higher price and lower
quality than the preferred ISO service, and that ISO's weredriven out of business by Kodak's policies. Under our prior
precedents, this evidence would be sufficient to entitle re-spondents to a trial on their claim of market power.

2
Kodak counters that even if it concedes monopoly shareof the relevant parts market, it cannot actually exercise the

necessary market power for a Sherman Act violation. Thisis so, according to Kodak, because competition exists in the
equipment market.10 Kodak argues that it could not have

10 In their brief and at oral argument, respondents argued that Kodak's
market share figures for high-volume copy machines, CAR systems, and
micrographic-capture equipment demonstrate Kodak's market power in
the equipment market. Brief for Respondents 16-18, 32-33; Tr. of Oral
Arg. 28-31.

In the Court of Appeals, however, respondents did not contest Kodak's
assertion that its market shares indicated a competitive equipment market. The Court of Appeals believed that respondents "do not dispute Kodak's assertion that it lacks market power in the [equipment] markets."
903 F. 2d, at 616, n. 3. Nor did respondents question Kodak's asserted
lack of market power in their brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari, although they acknowledged that Kodak's entire case rested on its
understanding that respondents were not disputing the existence of competition in the equipment market. Brief in Opposition 8.

Recognizing that on summary judgment we may examine the record de
novo without relying on the lower courts' understanding, United States v.
Diebold, Inc., 369 U. S. 654, 655 (1962), respondents now ask us to decline
to reach the merits of the questions presented in the petition, and instead
to affirm the Ninth Circuit's judgment based on the factual dispute over
market power in the equipment market. We decline respondents' invitation. We stated in Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U. S. 808, 816 (1985):
"Our decision to grant certiorari represents a commitment of scarce judi504US2$82F 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court

the ability to raise prices of service and parts above the levelthat would be charged in a competitive market because any

increase in profits from a higher price in the aftermarkets atleast would be offset by a corresponding loss in profits from
lower equipment sales as consumers began purchasing equip-ment with more attractive service costs.

Kodak does not present any actual data on the equipment,service, or parts markets. Instead, it urges the adoption of
a substantive legal rule that "equipment competition pre-cludes any finding of monopoly power in derivative aftermarkets." Brief for Petitioner 33. Kodak argues that such arule would satisfy its burden as the moving party of showing
"that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact" onthe market power issue.

11 See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c).

Legal presumptions that rest on formalistic distinctionsrather than actual market realities are generally disfavored

cial resources with a view to deciding the merits of one or more of the
questions presented in the petition." Because respondents failed to bring
their objections to the premise underlying the questions presented to our
attention in their opposition to the petition for certiorari, we decide those
questions based on the same premise as the Court of Appeals, namely,
that competition exists in the equipment market.

11 Kodak argues that such a rule would be per se, with no opportunity

for respondents to rebut the conclusion that market power is lacking in
the parts market. See Brief for Petitioner 30-31 ("There is nothing that
respondents could prove that would overcome Kodak's conceded lack of
market power"); id., at 30 (discovery is "pointless" once the "dispositive
fact" of lack of market power in the equipment market is conceded); id.,
at 22 (Kodak's lack of market power in the equipment market "dooms any
attempt to extract monopoly profits" even in an allegedly imperfect market); id., at 25 (it is "impossible" for Kodak to make more total profit by
overcharging its existing customers for service).

As an apparent second-best alternative, Kodak suggests elsewhere in
its brief that the rule would permit a defendant to meet its summary
judgment burden under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c); the burden
would then shift to the plaintiffs to "prove . . . that there is specific reason
to believe that normal economic reasoning does not apply." Brief for Petitioner 30. This is the United States' position. See Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 10-11.

below cost in the United States in the hope of expandingtheir market share sometime in the future. After several

years of detailed discovery, the defendants moved for sum-mary judgment. Id., at 577-582. Because the defendants
had every incentive not to engage in the alleged conductwhich required them to sustain losses for decades with no
foreseeable profits, the Court found an "absence of any ra-tional motive to conspire."

Id., at 597. In that context, theCourt determined that the plaintiffs' theory of predatory

pricing made no practical sense, was "speculative," and wasnot "reasonable." Id., at 588, 590, 593, 595, 597. Accordingly, the Court held that a reasonable jury could not returna verdict for the plaintiffs and that summary judgment
would be appropriate against them unless they came forwardwith more persuasive evidence to support their theory.

Id.,at 587-588, 595-598.

The Court's requirement in Matsushita that the plaintiffs'claims make economic sense did not introduce a special burden on plaintiffs facing summary judgment in antitrust cases.The Court did not hold that if the moving party enunciates
any economic theory supporting its behavior, regardless ofits accuracy in reflecting the actual market, it is entitled to
summary judgment. Matsushita demands only that thenonmoving party's inferences be reasonable in order to reach
the jury, a requirement that was not invented, but merelyarticulated, in that decision.

14 If the plaintiff 's theory is eco14 See, e. g., Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S. 242, 248 (1986)
("[S]ummary judgment will not lie . . . if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party"); Monsanto Co.

U. S. 253, 288-289 (1968) (defendant meets his burden under Rule 56(c)

Opinion of the Court
nomically senseless, no reasonable jury could find in its favor,and summary judgment should be granted.

Kodak, then, bears a substantial burden in showing that itis entitled to summary judgment. It must show that despite
evidence of increased prices and excluded competition, aninference of market power is unreasonable. To determine
whether Kodak has met that burden, we must unravel thefactual assumptions underlying its proposed rule that lack of
power in the equipment market necessarily precludes powerin the aftermarkets.

The extent to which one market prevents exploitation ofanother market depends on the extent to which consumers
will change their consumption of one product in responseto a price change in another, i. e., the "cross-elasticity of
demand." See Du Pont, 351 U. S., at 400; P. Areeda &L. Kaplow, Antitrust Analysis || 342(c) (4th ed. 1988).

15 KoCo. of New York, Inc. v. Siemens Medical Systems, Inc., 879 F. 2d 1005,

evidence in favor of the nonmoving party") (emphasis in original); Arnold
Pontiac-GMC, Inc. v. Budd Baer, Inc., 826 F. 2d 1335, 1339 (CA3 1987)

is reasonable' "); Instructional Systems Development Corp. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 817 F. 2d 639, 646 (CA10 1987) (summary judgment
not appropriate under Matsushita when defendants "could reasonably
have been economically motivated").

15 What constrains the defendant's ability to raise prices in the service

market is "the elasticity of demand faced by the defendant--the degree
to which its sales fall . . . as its price rises." Areeda & Kaplow || 342(c),
p. 576.

Courts usually have considered the relationship between price in one
market and demand in another in defining the relevant market. Because
market power is often inferred from market share, market definition generally determines the result of the case. Pitofsky, New Definitions of Relevant Market and the Assault on Antitrust, 90 Colum. L. Rev. 1805, 1806-
1813 (1990). Kodak chose to focus on market power directly rather than
arguing that the relationship between equipment and service and parts
is such that the three should be included in the same market definition.
Whether considered in the conceptual category of "market definition" or
"market power," the ultimate inquiry is the same--whether competition

Opinion of the Court

dak's proposed rule rests on a factual assumption about thecross-elasticity of demand in the equipment and aftermarkets: "If Kodak raised its parts or service prices above com-petitive levels, potential customers would simply stop buying
Kodak equipment. Perhaps Kodak would be able to in-crease short term profits through such a strategy, but at a
devastating cost to its long term interests." 16 Brief forPetitioner 12. Kodak argues that the Court should accept,
as a matter of law, this "basic economic realit[y]," id., at 24,that competition in the equipment market necessarily prevents market power in the aftermarkets.17Even if Kodak could not raise the price of service and
parts one cent without losing equipment sales, that factwould not disprove market power in the aftermarkets. The
sales of even a monopolist are reduced when it sells goods ata monopoly price, but the higher price more than compensates for the loss in sales. Areeda & Kaplow |||| 112 and340(a). Kodak's claim that charging more for service and
parts would be "a short-run game," Brief for Petitioner 26,is based on the false dichotomy that there are only two prices

in the equipment market will significantly restrain power in the service
and parts markets.

16 The United States as amicus curiae in support of Kodak echoes this

argument: "The ISOs' claims are implausible because Kodak lacks market
power in the markets for its copier and micrographic equipment. Buyers
of such equipment regard an increase in the price of parts or service as
an increase in the price of the equipment, and sellers recognize that the
revenues from sales of parts and service are attributable to sales of the
equipment. In such circumstances, it is not apparent how an equipment
manufacturer such as Kodak could exercise power in the aftermarkets for
parts and service." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 8.

17 It is clearly true, as the United States claims, that Kodak "cannot set

service or parts prices without regard to the impact on the market for
equipment." Id., at 20. The fact that the cross-elasticity of demand is
not zero proves nothing; the disputed issue is how much of an impact
an increase in parts and service prices has on equipment sales and on
Kodak's profits.

Opinion of the Court
that can be charged--a competitive price or a ruinous one.But there could easily be a middle, optimum price at which

the increased revenues from the higher priced sales of serv-ice and parts would more than compensate for the lower
revenues from lost equipment sales. The fact that theequipment market imposes a restraint on prices in the aftermarkets by no means disproves the existence of power inthose markets. See Areeda & Kaplow || 340(b) ("[T]he existence of significant substitution in the event of furtherprice increases or even at the

current price does not tell uswhether the defendant already exercises significant market

power") (emphasis in original). Thus, contrary to Kodak'sassertion, there is no immutable physical law--no "basic
economic reality"--insisting that competition in the equip-ment market cannot coexist with market power in the
aftermarkets.We next consider the more narrowly drawn question: Does
Kodak's theory describe actual market behavior so accu-rately that respondents' assertion of Kodak market power in
the aftermarkets, if not impossible, is at least unreason-able?

18 Cf. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith

Radio Corp., 475 U. S. 574 (1986).

18 Although Kodak repeatedly relies on Continental T. V. as support for
its factual assertion that the equipment market will prevent exploitation
of the service and parts markets, the case is inapposite. In Continental
T. V., the Court found that a manufacturer's policy restricting the number
of retailers that were permitted to sell its product could have a procompetitive effect. See 433 U. S., at 55. The Court also noted that any negative
effect of exploitation of the intrabrand market (the competition between
retailers of the same product) would be checked by competition in the
interbrand market (competition over the same generic product) because
consumers would substitute a different brand of the same product. Unlike Continental T. V., this case does not concern vertical relationships
between parties on different levels of the same distribution chain. In the
relevant market, service, Kodak and the ISO's are direct competitors; their
relationship is horizontal. The interbrand competition at issue here is
competition over the provision of service. Despite petitioner's best effort,

SERVICES, INC.

Opinion of the Court

To review Kodak's theory, it contends that higher serviceprices will lead to a disastrous drop in equipment sales. Presumably, the theory's corollary is to the effect that low serv-ice prices lead to a dramatic increase in equipment sales.
According to the theory, one would have expected Kodak totake advantage of lower priced ISO service as an opportunity to expand equipment sales. Instead, Kodak adopted arestrictive sales policy consciously designed to eliminate the
lower priced ISO service, an act that would be expected todevastate either Kodak's equipment sales or Kodak's faith in
its theory. Yet, according to the record, it has done neither.Service prices have risen for Kodak customers, but there is
no evidence or assertion that Kodak equipment sales havedropped.

Kodak and the United States attempt to reconcile Kodak'stheory with the contrary actual results by describing a "marketing strategy of spreading over time the total cost to thebuyer of Kodak equipment." Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 18; see also Brief for Petitioner 18. In otherwords, Kodak could charge subcompetitive prices for equipment and make up the difference with supracompetitiveprices for service, resulting in an overall competitive price.
This pricing strategy would provide an explanation for thetheory's descriptive failings--if Kodak in fact had adopted it.
But Kodak never has asserted that it prices its equipment orparts subcompetitively and recoups its profits through service. Instead, it claims that it prices its equipment compara-bly to its competitors and intends that both its equipment
sales and service divisions be profitable. See App. 159-161,170, 178, 188. Moreover, this hypothetical pricing strategy
is inconsistent with Kodak's policy toward its self-servicecustomers. If Kodak were underpricing its equipment, hoping to lock in customers and recover its losses in the service
repeating the mantra "interbrand competition" does not transform this
case into one over an agreement the manufacturer has with its dealers
that would fall under the rubric of Continental T. V.

Opinion of the Court
market, it could not afford to sell customers parts withoutservice. In sum, Kodak's theory does not explain the actual

market behavior revealed in the record.Respondents offer a forceful reason why Kodak's theory,
although perhaps intuitively appealing, may not accuratelyexplain the behavior of the primary and derivative markets
for complex durable goods: the existence of significant infor-mation and switching costs. These costs could create a less
responsive connection between service and parts prices andequipment sales.

For the service-market price to affect equipment demand,consumers must inform themselves of the total cost of the
"package"--equipment, service, and parts--at the time ofpurchase; that is, consumers must engage in accurate lifecycle pricing.19 Life-cycle pricing of complex, durable equip-ment is difficult and costly. In order to arrive at an accurate
price, a consumer must acquire a substantial amount of rawdata and undertake sophisticated analysis. The necessary
information would include data on price, quality, and avail-ability of products needed to operate, upgrade, or enhance
the initial equipment, as well as service and repair costs, in-cluding estimates of breakdown frequency, nature of repairs,
price of service and parts, length of "downtime," and lossesincurred from downtime.

20

Much of this information is difficult--some of it impossi-ble--to acquire at the time of purchase. During the life of

a product, companies may change the service and partsprices, and develop products with more advanced features, a

19 See Craswell, Tying Requirements in Competitive Markets: The Consumer Protection Issues, 62 B. U. L. Rev. 661, 676 (1982); Beales, Craswell, & Salop, The Efficient Regulation of Consumer Information, 24 J.
Law & Econ. 491, 509-511 (1981); Jefferson Parish, 466 U. S., at 15.

20 In addition, of course, in order to price accurately the equipment, a

consumer would need initial purchase information such as prices, features,
quality, and available warranties for different machinery with different
capabilities, and residual value information such as the longevity of product use and its potential resale or trade-in value.

Opinion of the Court

decreased need for repair, or new warranties. In addition,the information is likely to be customer specific; lifecycle

costs will vary from customer to customer with the type ofequipment, degrees of equipment use, and costs of downtime.

Kodak acknowledges the cost of information, but suggests,again without evidentiary support, that customer information needs will be satisfied by competitors in the equipmentmarkets. Brief for Petitioner 26, n. 11. It is a question of
fact, however, whether competitors would provide the neces-sary information. A competitor in the equipment market
may not have reliable information about the lifecycle costsof complex equipment it does not service or the needs of
customers it does not serve. Even if competitors had therelevant information, it is not clear that their interests would
be advanced by providing such information to consumers.See 2 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law || 404b1 (1978).

21

Moreover, even if consumers were capable of acquiring andprocessing the complex body of information, they may choose

not to do so. Acquiring the information is expensive. Ifthe costs of service are small relative to the equipment price,
or if consumers are more concerned about equipment capabil-ities than service costs, they may not find it cost efficient to

21 To inform consumers about Kodak, the competitor must be willing to
forgo the opportunity to reap supracompetitive prices in its own service
and parts markets. The competitor may anticipate that charging lower
service and parts prices and informing consumers about Kodak in the
hopes of gaining future equipment sales will cause Kodak to lower the
price on its service and parts, canceling any gains in equipment sales to
the competitor and leaving both worse off. Thus, in an equipment market
with relatively few sellers, competitors may find it more profitable to
adopt Kodak's service and parts policy than to inform the consumers. See
2 Areeda & Turner, Antitrust Law || 404b1; App. 177 (Kodak, Xerox, and
IBM together have nearly 100% of relevant market).

Even in a market with many sellers, any one competitor may not have
sufficient incentive to inform consumers because the increased patronage
attributable to the corrected consumer beliefs will be shared among other
competitors. Beales, Craswell, & Salop, 24 J. Law & Econ., at 503-504,
506.

Opinion of the Court
compile the information. Similarly, some consumers, suchas the Federal Government, have purchasing systems that

make it difficult to consider the complete cost of the "pack-age" at the time of purchase. State and local governments
often treat service as an operating expense and equipment as
a capital expense, delegating each to a different department.These governmental entities do not lifecycle price, but rather

choose the lowest price in each market. See Brief for Na-tional Association of State Purchasing Officials et al. as
Amici Curiae; Brief for State of Ohio et al. as Amici Curiae;App. 429-430.

As Kodak notes, there likely will be some large-volume,
sophisticated purchasers who will undertake the comparative studies and insist, in return for their patronage, that
Kodak charge them competitive lifecycle prices. Kodak contends that these knowledgeable customers will hold down
the package price for all other customers. Brief for Petitioner 23, n. 9. There are reasons, however, to doubt that
sophisticated purchasers will ensure that competitive prices
are charged to unsophisticated purchasers, too. As an initial
matter, if the number of sophisticated customers is relatively
small, the amount of profits to be gained by supracompetitive
pricing in the service market could make it profitable to let
the knowledgeable consumers take their business elsewhere.
More importantly, if a company is able to price discriminate
between sophisticated and unsophisticated consumers, the
sophisticated will be unable to prevent the exploitation of
the uninformed. A seller could easily price discriminate
by varying the equipment/parts/service package, developing
different warranties, or offering price discounts on different
components.

Given the potentially high cost of information and the
possibility that a seller may be able to price discriminate
between knowledgeable and unsophisticated consumers, it
makes little sense to assume, in the absence of any evidentiary support, that equipment-purchasing decisions are based

on an accurate assessment of the total cost of equipment,
service, and parts over the lifetime of the machine.22

Indeed, respondents have presented evidence that Kodak
practices price discrimination by selling parts to customers
who service their own equipment, but refusing to sell parts
to customers who hire third-party service companies. Companies that have their own service staff are likely to be highvolume users, the same companies for whom it is most likely
to be economically worthwhile to acquire the complex information needed for comparative lifecycle pricing.

A second factor undermining Kodak's claim that supracompetitive prices in the service market lead to ruinous losses
in equipment sales is the cost to current owners of switching
to a different product. See Areeda & Turner || 519a.23 If
the cost of switching is high, consumers who already have
purchased the equipment, and are thus "locked in," will tolerate some level of service-price increases before changing
equipment brands. Under this scenario, a seller profitably
could maintain supracompetitive prices in the aftermarket
if the switching costs were high relative to the increase in
service prices, and the number of locked-in customers were
high relative to the number of new purchasers.

Moreover, if the seller can price discriminate between its
locked-in customers and potential new customers, this strategy is even more likely to prove profitable. The seller could
simply charge new customers below-marginal cost on the
equipment and recoup the charges in service, or offer pack22 See Salop & Stiglitz, Bargains and Ripoffs: A Model of Monopolistically Competitive Price Dispersion, 44 Rev. Econ. Studies 493 (1977);

Opinion of the Court
ages with lifetime warranties or long-term service agree-ments that are not available to locked-in customers.

Respondents have offered evidence that the heavy initialoutlay for Kodak equipment, combined with the required
support material that works only with Kodak equipment,
makes switching costs very high for existing Kodak cus-tomers. And Kodak's own evidence confirms that it varies

the package price of equipment/parts/service for differentcustomers.

In sum, there is a question of fact whether informationcosts and switching costs foil the simple assumption that the
equipment and service markets act as pure complements toone another.

24

We conclude, then, that Kodak has failed to demonstratethat respondents' inference of market power in the service

and parts markets is unreasonable, and that, consequently,Kodak is entitled to summary judgment. It is clearly reasonable to infer that Kodak has market power to raise prices
and drive out competition in the aftermarkets, since respondents offer direct evidence that Kodak did so.25 It is
also plausible, as discussed above, to infer that Kodak chose
to gain immediate profits by exerting that market power
where locked-in customers, high information costs, and discriminatory pricing limited and perhaps eliminated any long24 The dissent disagrees based on its hypothetical case of a tie between
equipment and service. "The only thing lacking" to bring this case within
the hypothetical case, states the dissent, "is concrete evidence that the
restrictive parts policy was . . . generally known." Post, at 492. But
the dissent's "only thing lacking" is the crucial thing lacking--evidence.
Whether a tie between parts and service should be treated identically to
a tie between equipment and service, as the dissent and Kodak argue,
depends on whether the equipment market prevents the exertion of market power in the parts market. Far from being "anomalous," post, at
492-493, requiring Kodak to provide evidence on this factual question is
completely consistent with our prior precedent. See, e. g., n. 13, supra.

25 Cf. Instructional Systems, 817 F. 2d, at 646 (finding the conspiracy

reasonable under Matsushita because its goals were in fact achieved).

term loss. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable
to respondents, their allegations of market power "mak[e] . . .
economic sense." Cf. Matsushita, 475 U. S., at 587.

Nor are we persuaded by Kodak's contention that it is entitled to a legal presumption on the lack of market power
because, as in Matsushita, there is a significant risk of deterring procompetitive conduct. Plaintiffs in Matsushita
attempted to prove the antitrust conspiracy "through evidence of rebates and other price-cutting activities." Id., at
594. Because cutting prices to increase business is "the
very essence of competition," the Court was concerned that
mistaken inferences would be "especially costly" and would
"chill the very conduct the antitrust laws are designed to
protect." Ibid. See also Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U. S. 752, 763 (1984) (permitting inference of
concerted action would "deter or penalize perfectly legitimate conduct"). But the facts in this case are just the opposite. The alleged conduct--higher service prices and market foreclosure--is facially anticompetitive and exactly the
harm that antitrust laws aim to prevent. In this situation,
Matsushita does not create any presumption in favor of summary judgment for the defendant.

Kodak contends that, despite the appearance of anticompetitiveness, its behavior actually favors competition because its ability to pursue innovative marketing plans will
allow it to compete more effectively in the equipment market. Brief for Petitioner 40-41. A pricing strategy based
on lower equipment prices and higher aftermarket prices
could enhance equipment sales by making it easier for the
buyer to finance the initial purchase.26 It is undisputed that
competition is enhanced when a firm is able to offer various
marketing options, including bundling of support and maintenance service with the sale of equipment. Nor do such ac26 It bears repeating that in this case Kodak has never claimed that it is
in fact pursuing such a pricing strategy.

Opinion of the Court
tions run afoul of the antitrust laws.27 But the procompetitive effect of the specific conduct challenged here,
eliminating all consumer parts and service options, is far
less clear.28

We need not decide whether Kodak's behavior has any procompetitive effects and, if so, whether they outweigh the
anticompetitive effects. We note only that Kodak's service
and parts policy is simply not one that appears always or
almost always to enhance competition, and therefore to warrant a legal presumption without any evidence of its actual
economic impact. In this case, when we weigh the risk of
deterring procompetitive behavior by proceeding to trial
against the risk that illegal behavior will go unpunished, the
balance tips against summary judgment. Cf. Matsushita,
475 U. S., at 594-595.

For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Kodak has not met
the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c).
We therefore affirm the denial of summary judgment on respondents' $ 1 claim.29

27 See Jefferson Parish, 466 U. S., at 12 ("Buyers often find package sales
attractive; a seller's decision to offer such packages can merely be an attempt to compete effectively--conduct that is entirely consistent with the
Sherman Act"). See also Yates & DiResta, Software Support and Hardware Maintenance Practices: Tying Considerations, The Computer Lawyer, Vol. 8, No. 6, p. 17 (1991) (describing various service and parts policies
that enhance quality and sales but do not violate the antitrust laws).

28 Two of the largest consumers of service and parts contend that they

are worse off when the equipment manufacturer also controls service and
parts. See Brief for State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. et al.
as Amici Curiae; Brief for State of Ohio et al. as Amici Curiae.

29 The dissent urges a radical departure in this Court's antitrust law. It

argues that because Kodak has only an "inherent" monopoly in parts for
its equipment, post, at 489-490, the antitrust laws do not apply to its efforts to expand that power into other markets. The dissent's proposal to
grant per se immunity to manufacturers competing in the service market
would exempt a vast and growing sector of the economy from antitrust
laws. Leaving aside the question whether the Court has the authority to

III
Respondents also claim that they have presented genuineissues for trial as to whether Kodak has monopolized, or atmake such a policy decision, there is no support for it in our jurisprudence
or the evidence in this case.

Even assuming, despite the absence of any proof from the dissent, that
all manufacturers possess some inherent market power in the parts market, it is not clear why that should immunize them from the antitrust laws
in another market. The Court has held many times that power gained
through some natural and legal advantage such as a patent, copyright, or
business acumen can give rise to liability if "a seller exploits his dominant
position in one market to expand his empire into the next." TimesPicayune Publishing Co. v. United States, 345 U. S. 594, 611 (1953); see,
e. g., Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356 U. S. 1 (1958); United
States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 U. S. 131 (1948); Leitch Mfg. Co.
v. Barber Co., 302 U. S. 458, 463 (1938). Moreover, on the occasions when
the Court has considered tying in derivative aftermarkets by manufacturers, it has not adopted any exception to the usual antitrust analysis, treating derivative aftermarkets as it has every other separate market. See
International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U. S. 392 (1947); International Business Machines Corp. v. United States, 298 U. S. 131 (1936);
United Shoe Machinery Corp. v. United States, 258 U. S. 451 (1922). Our
past decisions are reason enough to reject the dissent's proposal. See
Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172-173 (1989) ("Considerations of stare decisis have special force in the area of statutory interpretation, for here, unlike in the context of constitutional interpretation,
the legislative power is implicated, and Congress remains free to alter
what we have done").

Nor does the record in this case support the dissent's proposed exemption for aftermarkets. The dissent urges its exemption because the tie
here "does not permit the manufacturer to project power over a class of
consumers distinct from that which it is already able to exploit (and fully)
without the inconvenience of the tie." Post, at 498. Beyond the dissent's
obvious difficulty in explaining why Kodak would adopt this expensive
tying policy if it could achieve the same profits more conveniently through
some other means, respondents offer an alternative theory, supported by
the record, that suggests Kodak is able to exploit some customers who in
the absence of the tie would be protected from increases in parts prices
by knowledgeable customers. See supra, at 475-476.

At bottom, whatever the ultimate merits of the dissent's theory, at this
point it is mere conjecture. Neither Kodak nor the dissent have provided

tempted to monopolize, the service and parts markets in vio-lation of $ 2 of the Sherman Act. "The offense of monopoly

under $ 2 of the Sherman Act has two elements: (1) the pos-session of monopoly power in the relevant market and (2) the
willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distin-guished from growth or development as a consequence of a
superior product, business acumen, or historic accident."
United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U. S., at 570-571.

A
The existence of the first element, possession of monopolypower, is easily resolved. As has been noted, respondents

have presented a triable claim that service and parts areseparate markets, and that Kodak has the "power to control
prices or exclude competition" in service and parts. Du
Pont, 351 U. S., at 391. Monopoly power under $ 2 requires,of course, something greater than market power under $ 1.

See Fortner, 394 U. S., at 502. Respondents' evidence thatKodak controls nearly 100% of the parts market and 80% to
95% of the service market, with no readily available substi-tutes, is, however, sufficient to survive summary judgment
under the more stringent monopoly standard of $ 2. See
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Board of Regents of
Univ. of Okla., 468 U. S. 85, 112 (1984). Cf. United Statesv. Grinnell Corp., 384 U. S., at 571 (87% of the market is a

monopoly); American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U. S.781, 797 (1946) (over two-thirds of the market is a monopoly).

Kodak also contends that, as a matter of law, a singlebrand of a product or service can never be a relevant market
under the Sherman Act. We disagree. The relevant marany evidence refuting respondents' theory of forced unwanted purchases
at higher prices and price discrimination. While it may be, as the dissent
predicts, that the equipment market will prevent any harms to consumers
in the aftermarkets, the dissent never makes plain why the Court should
accept that theory on faith rather than requiring the usual evidence
needed to win a summary judgment motion.

ket for antitrust purposes is determined by the choices avail-able to Kodak equipment owners. See Jefferson Parish, 466

U. S., at 19. Because service and parts for Kodak equipmentare not interchangeable with other manufacturers' service
and parts, the relevant market from the Kodak equipmentowner's perspective is composed of only those companies
that service Kodak machines. See Du Pont, 351 U. S., at404 ("The market is composed of products that have reasonable interchangeability").30 This Court's prior cases supportthe proposition that in some instances one brand of a product
can constitute a separate market. See National Collegiate

of America, 148 F. 2d, at 432. Kodak contends that it hasthree valid business justifications for its actions: "(1) to promote interbrand equipment competition by allowing Kodakto stress the quality of its service; (2) to improve asset management by reducing Kodak's inventory costs; and (3) to pre-vent ISOs from free-riding on Kodak's capital investment in
equipment, parts and service." Brief for Petitioner 6. Fac-tual questions exist, however, about the validity and sufficiency of each claimed justification, making summary judg-ment inappropriate.

Kodak first asserts that by preventing customers fromusing ISO's, "it [can] best maintain high quality service for
its sophisticated equipment" and avoid being "blamed for anequipment malfunction, even if the problem is the result of
improper diagnosis, maintenance or repair by an ISO." Id.,at 6-7. Respondents have offered evidence that ISO's provide quality service and are preferred by some Kodak equip-ment owners. This is sufficient to raise a genuine issue of

legitimate competitive reasons for the refusal. See Aspen Skiing Co., 472

fact. See International Business Machines Corp. v. United
States, 298 U. S., at 139-140 (rejecting IBM's claim that it
had to control the cards used in its machines to avoid "injuryto the reputation of the machines and the good will of " IBM

in the absence of proof that other companies could not make
quality cards); International Salt Co. v. United States, 332U. S. 392, 397-398 (1947) (rejecting International Salt's claim

that it had to control the supply of salt to protect its leasedmachines in the absence of proof that competitors could not
supply salt of equal quality).Moreover, there are other reasons to question Kodak's
proffered motive of commitment to quality service; its quality justification appears inconsistent with its thesis that consumers are knowledgeable enough to lifecycle price, and its
self-service policy. Kodak claims the exclusive-service contract is warranted because customers would otherwise blame
Kodak equipment for breakdowns resulting from inferior
ISO service. Thus, Kodak simultaneously claims that its
customers are sophisticated enough to make complex and
subtle lifecycle-pricing decisions, and yet too obtuse to distinguish which breakdowns are due to bad equipment and
which are due to bad service. Kodak has failed to offer any
reason why informational sophistication should be present in
one circumstance and absent in the other. In addition, because self-service customers are just as likely as others to
blame Kodak equipment for breakdowns resulting from
(their own) inferior service, Kodak's willingness to allow
self-service casts doubt on its quality claim. In sum, we
agree with the Court of Appeals that respondents "have presented evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could
conclude that Kodak's first reason is pretextual." 903 F. 2d,
at 618.

There is also a triable issue of fact on Kodak's second
justification--controlling inventory costs. As respondents
argue, Kodak's actions appear inconsistent with any need to
control inventory costs. Presumably, the inventory of parts

Opinion of the Court
needed to repair Kodak machines turns only on breakdownrates, and those rates should be the same whether Kodak or

ISO's perform the repair. More importantly, the justifica-tion fails to explain respondents' evidence that Kodak forced
OEM's, equipment owners, and parts brokers not to sellparts to ISO's, actions that would have no effect on Kodak's
inventory costs.Nor does Kodak's final justification entitle it to summary
judgment on respondents' $ 2 claim. Kodak claims that itspolicies prevent ISO's from "exploit[ing] the investment
Kodak has made in product development, manufacturing andequipment sales in order to take away Kodak's service revenues." Brief for Petitioner 7-8. Kodak does not disputethat respondents invest substantially in the service market,
with training of repair workers and investment in parts in-ventory. Instead, according to Kodak, the ISO's are freeriding because they have failed to enter the equipment andparts markets. This understanding of free-riding has no
support in our case law.33 To the contrary, as the Court ofAppeals noted, one of the evils proscribed by the antitrust
laws is the creation of entry barriers to potential competitorsby requiring them to enter two markets simultaneously.

Jefferson Parish, 466 U. S., at 14; Fortner, 394 U. S., at 509.None of Kodak's asserted business justifications, then, are

sufficient to prove that Kodak is "entitled to a judgment as

33 Kodak claims that both Continental T. V. and Monsanto support its
free-rider argument. Neither is applicable. In both Continental T. V.,
433 U. S., at 55, and Monsanto, 465 U. S., at 762-763, the Court accepted
free-riding as a justification because without restrictions a manufacturer
would not be able to induce competent and aggressive retailers to make
the kind of investment of capital and labor necessary to distribute the
product. In Continental T. V. the relevant market level was retail sale
of televisions and in Monsanto retail sales of herbicides. Some retailers
were investing in those markets; others were not, relying, instead, on the
investment of the other retailers. To be applicable to this case, the ISO's
would have to be relying on Kodak's investment in the service market;
that, however, is not Kodak's argument.

In the end, of course, Kodak's arguments may prove to becorrect. It may be that its parts, service, and equipment

are components of one unified market, or that the equipmentmarket does discipline the aftermarkets so that all three are
priced competitively overall, or that any anticompetitive ef-fects of Kodak's behavior are outweighed by its competitive
effects. But we cannot reach these conclusions as a matterof law on a record this sparse. Accordingly, the judgment
of the Court of Appeals denying summary judgment isaffirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia, with whom Justice O'Connor and
Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

This is not, as the Court describes it, just "another casethat concerns the standard for summary judgment in an antitrust controversy." Ante, at 454. Rather, the case pre-sents a very narrow--but extremely important--question of
substantive antitrust law: whether, for purposes of applyingour per se rule condemning "ties," and for purposes of applying our exacting rules governing the behavior of would-bemonopolists, a manufacturer's conceded lack of power in the
interbrand market for its equipment is somehow consistentwith its possession of "market," or even "monopoly," power
in wholly derivative aftermarkets for that equipment. Inmy view, the Court supplies an erroneous answer to this
question, and I dissent. I

Per se rules of antitrust illegality are reserved for thosesituations where logic and experience show that the risk of
injury to competition from the defendant's behavior is so pro-nounced that it is needless and wasteful to conduct the usual
judicial inquiry into the balance between the behavior's pro504US2$82K 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT

competitive benefits and its anticompetitive costs. See, e. g.,Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, 457 U. S. 332,

350-351 (1982). "The character of the restraint produced by[behavior to which a per se rule applies] is considered a sufficient basis for presuming unreasonableness without the ne-cessity of any analysis of the market context in which the
[behavior] may be found." Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist.
No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U. S. 2, 9 (1984). The per se rule againsttying is just such a rule: Where the conditions precedent to

application of the rule are met, i. e., where the tying arrange-ment is backed up by the defendant's market power in the
"tying" product, the arrangement is adjudged in violation of$ 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 1 (1988 ed., Supp. II),
without any inquiry into the practice's actual effect on com-petition and consumer welfare. But see

United States v.Jerrold Electronics Corp., 187 F. Supp. 545, 560 (ED Pa.

1960), aff 'd, 365 U. S. 567 (1961) (per curiam) (accepting af-firmative defense to per se tying allegation).

Despite intense criticism of the tying doctrine in academiccircles, see,

e. g., R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 365-381(1978), the stated rationale for our per se rule has varied

little over the years. When the defendant has genuine"market power" in the tying product--the power to raise
price by reducing output--the tie potentially enables him toextend that power into a second distinct market, enhancing
barriers to entry in each. In addition:

"[T]ying arrangements may be used to evade price con-trol in the tying product through clandestine transfer of

the profit to the tied product; they may be used as acounting device to effect price discrimination; and they
may be used to force a full line of products on the cus-tomer so as to extract more easily from him a monopoly
return on one unique product in the line." Fortner En-terprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., 394 U. S. 495,
513-514 (1969) (Fortner I) (White, J., dissenting) (foot-notes omitted).

Scalia, J., dissenting

For these reasons, as we explained in Jefferson Parish, "thelaw draws a distinction between the exploitation of market

power by merely enhancing the price of the tying product,on the one hand, and by attempting to impose restraints on
competition in the market for a tied product, on the other."
466 U. S., at 14.Our $ 2 monopolization doctrines are similarly directed to

discrete situations in which a defendant's possession of sub-stantial market power, combined with his exclusionary or anticompetitive behavior, threatens to defeat or forestall thecorrective forces of competition and thereby sustain or extend the defendant's agglomeration of power. See United
States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U. S. 563, 570-571 (1966).
Where a defendant maintains substantial market power, his
activities are examined through a special lens: Behavior that
might otherwise not be of concern to the antitrust laws--or
that might even be viewed as procompetitive--can take on
exclusionary connotations when practiced by a monopolist.
3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law || 813, pp. 300-302
(1978) (hereinafter 3 Areeda & Turner).

The concerns, however, that have led the courts to heightened scrutiny both of the "exclusionary conduct" practiced
by a monopolist and of tying arrangements subject to per se
prohibition, are completely without force when the participants lack market power. As to the former, "[t]he [very]
definition of exclusionary conduct," as practiced by a monopolist, is "predicated on the existence of substantial market
power." Id., || 813, at 301; see, e. g., Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382 U. S.

|| 724, at 195-197 (vertical integration). And with respect to
tying, we have recognized that bundling arrangements not
coerced by the heavy hand of market power can serve the
procompetitive functions of facilitating new entry into cer504US2$82K 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT

tain markets, see, e. g., Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370U. S. 294, 330 (1962), permitting "clandestine price cutting in

products which otherwise would have no price competitionat all because of fear of retaliation from the few other producers dealing in the market," Fortner I, supra, at 514,
n. 9 (White, J., dissenting), assuring quality control, see,
e. g., Standard Oil Co. of Cal. v. United States, 337 U. S. 293,
306 (1949), and, where "the tied and tying products are func-tionally related, . . . reduc[ing] costs through economies of

joint production and distribution." Fortner I, supra, at 514,n. 9 (

White, J., dissenting). "Accordingly, we have [only]
condemned tying arrangements [under the per se rule] when
the seller has some special ability--usually called `market
power'--to force a purchaser to do something that he would
not do in a competitive market." Jefferson Parish, supra,
at 13-14.

The Court today finds in the typical manufacturer's inherent power over its own brand of equipment--over the sale
of distinctive repair parts for that equipment, for example--
the sort of "monopoly power" sufficient to bring the sledgehammer of $ 2 into play. And, not surprisingly in light of
that insight, it readily labels single-brand power over aftermarket products "market power" sufficient to permit an antitrust plaintiff to invoke the per se rule against tying. In
my opinion, this makes no economic sense. The holding that
market power can be found on the present record causes
these venerable rules of selective proscription to extend well
beyond the point where the reasoning that supports them
leaves off. Moreover, because the sort of power condemned
by the Court today is possessed by every manufacturer of
durable goods with distinctive parts, the Court's opinion
threatens to release a torrent of litigation and a flood of commercial intimidation that will do much more harm than good
to enforcement of the antitrust laws and to genuine competition. I shall explain, in Parts II and III, respectively, how

On appeal in the Ninth Circuit, respondents, havingwaived their "rule of reason" claim, were limited to arguing

that the record, construed in the light most favorable tothem, Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S. 242, 255
(1986), supported application of the per se tying prohibitionto Kodak's restrictive parts and service policy. See 903
F. 2d 612, 615, n. 1 (1990). As the Court observes, in orderto survive Kodak's motion for summary judgment on this
claim, respondents bore the burden of proffering evidence onwhich a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that Kodak
possesses power in the market for the alleged "tying" prod-uct. See

ante, at 464; Jefferson Parish, 466 U. S., at 13-14.

A
We must assume, for purposes of deciding this case, thatpetitioner is without market, much less monopoly, power in

the interbrand markets for its micrographic and photocopy-ing equipment. See

ante, at 465-466, n. 10; Oklahoma Cityv.
Tuttle, 471 U. S. 808, 816 (1985). In the District Court,respondents did, in fact, include in their complaint an allegation which posited the interbrand equipment markets as therelevant markets; in particular, they alleged a $ 1 "tie" of
micrographic and photocopying equipment to the parts andservice for those machines. App. 22-23. Though this allegation was apparently abandoned in pursuit of $$ 1 and 2claims focused exclusively on the parts and service aftermarkets (about which more later), I think it helpful to analyzehow that claim would have fared under the

per se rule.Had Kodak--from the date of its entry into the micrographic and photocopying equipment markets--included alifetime parts and service warranty with all original equip504US2$82K 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT

ment, or required consumers to purchase a lifetime partsand service contract with each machine, that bundling of

equipment, parts, and service would no doubt constitutea tie under the tests enunciated in

Jefferson Parish, supra.
Nevertheless, it would be immune from per se scrutiny under
the antitrust laws because the tying product would be equipment, a market in which (we assume) Kodak has no power
to influence price or quantity. See id., at 13-14; United
States Steel Corp. v. Fortner Enterprises, Inc., 429 U. S. 610,
620 (1977) (Fortner II); Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United
States, 356 U. S. 1, 6-7 (1958). The same result would obtain, I think, had Kodak--from the date of its market entry--
consistently pursued an announced policy of limiting parts
sales in the manner alleged in this case, so that customers
bought with the knowledge that aftermarket support could
be obtained only from Kodak. The foreclosure of respondents from the business of servicing Kodak's micrographic and
photocopying machines in these illustrations would be undeniably complete--as complete as the foreclosure described in
respondents' complaint. Nonetheless, we would inquire no
further than to ask whether Kodak's market power in the
equipment market effectively forced consumers to purchase
Kodak micrographic or photocopying machines subject to the
company's restrictive aftermarket practices. If not, that
would end the case insofar as the per se rule was concerned.
See Jefferson Parish, supra, at 13-14; 9 P. Areeda, Antitrust

Economics of Franchise Tying Contracts, 28 J. Law & Econ.
345, 356 (1985). The evils against which the tying prohibition is directed would simply not be presented. Interbrand
competition would render Kodak powerless to gain economic
power over an additional class of consumers, to price discriminate by charging each customer a "system" price equal
to the system's economic value to that customer, or to raise
barriers to entry in the interbrand equipment markets. See

I have described these illustrations as hypothetical, but infact they are not far removed from this case. The record

below is consistent--in large part--with just this sort ofbundling of equipment on the one hand, with parts and service on the other. The restrictive parts policy, with respect
to micrographic equipment at least, was not even alleged tobe anything but prospective. See App. 17. As respondents

summarized their factual proffer below:

"Under this policy, Kodak cut off parts on new productsto Kodak micrographics [independent service organizations] ISOs. The effect of this, of course, was that as
customers of Kodak micrographics ISOs obtained newequipment, the ISOs were unable to service the equipment for that customer, and, service for these customerswas lost by the Kodak ISOs. Additionally, as equipment became obsolete, and the equipment populationbecame all "new equipment" (post April 1985 models),
Kodak micrographics ISOs would be able to service no
equipment at all." Id., at 360.

As to Kodak copiers, Kodak's restrictive parts policy had abroader foundation: Considered in the light most favorable

to respondents, see Anderson, supra, at 255, the record sug-gests that, from its inception, the policy was applied to new
and existing copier customers alike. But at least all post1985 purchasers of micrographic equipment, like all post-1985 purchasers of new Kodak copiers, could have been

aware of Kodak's parts practices. The only thing lacking tobring all of these purchasers (accounting for the vast bulk of
the commerce at issue here) squarely within the hypotheticals we have described is concrete evidence that the restrictive parts policy was announced or generally known. Thus,
under the Court's approach the existence vel non of such
evidence is determinative of the legal standard (the per se
rule versus the rule of reason) under which the alleged tie
is examined. In my judgment, this makes no sense. It is

quite simply anomalous that a manufacturer functioning in acompetitive equipment market should be exempt from the

per se rule when it bundles equipment with parts and serv-ice, but not when it bundles parts with service. This vast
difference in the treatment of what will ordinarily be eco-nomically similar phenomena is alone enough to call today's
decision into question. B

In the Court of Appeals, respondents sought to sidestepthe impediment posed by interbrand competition to their invocation of the per se tying rule by zeroing in on the partsand service "aftermarkets" for Kodak equipment. By alleging a tie of parts to service, rather than of equipment toparts and service, they identified a tying product in which
Kodak unquestionably held a near-monopoly share: the partsuniquely associated with Kodak's brand of machines. See
Jefferson Parish, 466 U. S., at 17. The Court today holdsthat such a facial showing of market share in a single-brand
aftermarket is sufficient to invoke the per se rule. The ex-istence of even vibrant interbrand competition is no defense.
See ante, at 470-471.I find this a curious form of market power on which to
premise the application of a per se proscription. It is en-joyed by virtually every manufacturer of durable goods
requiring aftermarket support with unique, or relativelyunique, goods. See P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust
Law || 525.1, p. 563 (Supp. 1991). "[S]uch reasoning makesevery maker of unique parts for its own product a holder
of market power no matter how unimportant its product
might be in the market." Ibid. (emphasis added).1 Under

1 That there exist innumerable parts and service firms in such industries
as the automobile industry, see Brief for Automotive Warehouse Distributors Association et al. as Amici Curiae 2-3, does not detract from this
point. The question whether power to control an aftermarket exists is
quite distinct from the question whether the power has been exercised.
Manufacturers in some markets have no doubt determined that exclusion504US2$82K 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT

the Court's analysis, the per se rule may now be applied tosingle-brand ties effected by the most insignificant players

in fully competitive interbrand markets, as long as the ar-rangement forecloses aftermarket competitors from more
than a de minimis amount of business, Fortner I, 394 U. S.,at 501. This seems to me quite wrong. A tying arrangement "forced" through the exercise of such power no moreimplicates the leveraging and price discrimination concerns
behind the per se tying prohibition than does a tie of theforemarket brand to its aftermarket derivatives, which--as
I have explained--would not be subject to per se condemna-tion.

2 As implemented, the Kodak arrangement challenged

ary intrabrand conduct works to their disadvantage at the competitive
interbrand level, but this in no way refutes the self-evident reality that
control over unique replacement parts for single-branded goods is ordinarily available to such manufacturers for the taking. It confounds sound
analysis to suggest, as respondents do, see Brief for Respondents 5, 37,
that the asserted fact that Kodak manufactures only 10% of its replacement parts, and purchases the rest from original equipment manufacturers, casts doubt on Kodak's possession of an inherent advantage in the
aftermarkets. It does no such thing, any more than Kodak's contracting
with others for the manufacture of all constituent parts included in its
original equipment would alone suggest that Kodak lacks power in the
interbrand micrographic and photocopying equipment markets. The
suggestion implicit in respondents' analysis--that if a seller chooses to
contract for the manufacture of its branded merchandise, it must permit
the contractors to compete in the sale of that merchandise--is plainly
unprecedented.

2 Even with interbrand power, I may observe, it is unlikely that Kodak

could have incrementally exploited its position through the tie of parts to
service alleged here. Most of the "service" at issue is inherently associated with the parts, i. e., that service involved in incorporating the parts
into Kodak equipment, and the two items tend to be demanded by customers in fixed proportions (one part with one unit of service necessary to
install the part). When that situation obtains, " `no revenue can be derived from setting a higher price for the tied product which could not
have been made by setting the optimum price for the tying product.' " P.
Areeda & L. Kaplow, Antitrust Analysis || 426(a), p. 706 (4th ed. 1988)
(quoting Bowman, Tying Arrangements and the Leverage Problem, 67

in this case may have implicated truth-in-advertising or
other consumer protection concerns, but those concerns do
not alone suggest an antitrust prohibition. See, e. g., Town
Sound and Custom Tops, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 959
F. 2d 468 (CA3 1992) (en banc).

In the absence of interbrand power, a seller's predominant
or monopoly share of its single-brand derivative markets
does not connote the power to raise derivative market prices
generally by reducing quantity. As Kodak and its principal
amicus, the United States, point out, a rational consumer
considering the purchase of Kodak equipment will inevitably
factor into his purchasing decision the expected cost of aftermarket support. "[B]oth the price of the equipment and the
price of parts and service over the life of the equipment are
expenditures that are necessary to obtain copying and micrographic services." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13. If Kodak set generally supracompetitive prices for
either spare parts or repair services without making an offsetting reduction in the price of its machines, rational consumers would simply turn to Kodak's competitors for photocopying and micrographic systems. See, e. g., Grappone,
Inc. v. Subaru of New England, Inc., 858 F. 2d 792, 796-798
(CA1 1988). True, there are--as the Court notes, see ante,
at 474-475--the occasional irrational consumers that consider
only the hardware cost at the time of purchase (a category
that regrettably includes the Federal Government, whose
"purchasing system," we are told, assigns foremarket purchases and aftermarket purchases to different entities). But

parts and the service involved in installing them should not be treated
as distinct products for antitrust tying purposes. See Jefferson Parish
Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U. S. 2, 39 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) ("For products to be treated as distinct, the tied product
must, at a minimum, be one that some consumers might wish to purchase
separately without also purchasing the tying product") (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted); Ross, The Single Product Issue in Antitrust Tying:
A Functional Approach, 23 Emory L. J. 963, 1009-1010 (1974).

we have never before premised the application of antitrustdoctrine on the lowest common denominator of consumer.

The Court attempts to counter this theoretical point witha theory of its own. It says that there are "information
costs"--the costs and inconvenience to the consumer of acquiring and processing life-cycle pricing data for Kodak ma-chines--that "could create a less responsive connection between service and parts prices and equipment sales." Ante,at 473. But this truism about the functioning of markets
for sophisticated equipment cannot create "market power"of concern to the antitrust laws where otherwise there is
none. "Information costs," or, more accurately, gaps in the
availability and quality of consumer information, pervade
real-world markets; and because consumers generally make
do with "rough cut" judgments about price in such circumstances, in virtually any market there are zones within which
otherwise competitive suppliers may overprice their products without losing appreciable market share. We have
never suggested that the principal players in a market with
such commonplace informational deficiencies (and, thus,
bands of apparent consumer pricing indifference) exercise
market power in any sense relevant to the antitrust laws.
"While [such] factors may generate `market power' in some
abstract sense, they do not generate the kind of market
power that justifies condemnation of tying." Jefferson Parish, 466 U. S., at 27; see, e. g., Town Sound and Custom Tops,
Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., supra.

Respondents suggest that, even if the existence of interbrand competition prevents Kodak from raising prices generally in its single-brand aftermarkets, there remain certain
consumers who are necessarily subject to abusive Kodak
pricing behavior by reason of their being "locked in" to their
investments in Kodak machines. The Court agrees; indeed,
it goes further by suggesting that even a general policy of
supracompetitive aftermarket prices might be profitable
over the long run because of the "lock-in" phenomenon. "[A]

were high relative to the increase in service prices, and thenumber of locked-in customers were high relative to the
number of new purchasers." Ante, at 476. In speculating
about this latter possibility, the Court is essentially repudiat-ing the assumption on which we are bound to decide this

case, viz., Kodak's lack of any power whatsoever in the inter-brand market. If Kodak's

general increase in aftermarket
prices were to bring the total "system" price above competi-tive levels in the interbrand market, Kodak would be wholly

unable to make further foremarket sales--and would find
itself exploiting an ever-dwindling aftermarket, as those
Kodak micrographic and photocopying machines already in
circulation passed into disuse.

The Court's narrower point, however, is undeniably true.
There will be consumers who, because of their capital investment in Kodak equipment, "will tolerate some level of
service-price increases before changing equipment brands,"
ibid.; this is necessarily true for "every maker of unique
parts for its own product." Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law || 525.1b, at 563. But this "circumstantial" leverage created by consumer investment regularly crops up in
smoothly functioning, even perfectly competitive, markets,
and in most--if not all--of its manifestations, it is of no concern to the antitrust laws. The leverage held by the manufacturer of a malfunctioning refrigerator (which is measured
by the consumer's reluctance to walk away from his initial
investment in that device) is no different in kind or degree
from the leverage held by the swimming pool contractor
when he discovers a 5-ton boulder in his customer's backyard
and demands an additional sum of money to remove it; or the
leverage held by an airplane manufacturer over an airline
that has "standardized" its fleet around the manufacturer's
models; or the leverage held by a drill press manufacturer
whose customers have built their production lines around the

manufacturer's particular style of drill press; or the leverage
held by an insurance company over its independent sales
force that has invested in company-specific paraphernalia; or
the leverage held by a mobile home park owner over his tenants, who are unable to transfer their homes to a different
park except at great expense, see generally Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519 (1992). Leverage, in the form of circumstantial power, plays a role in each of these relationships;
but in none of them is the leverage attributable to the dominant party's market power in any relevant sense. Though
that power can plainly work to the injury of certain consumers, it produces only "a brief perturbation in competitive conditions--not the sort of thing the antitrust laws do or should
worry about." Parts & Elec. Motors, Inc. v. Sterling Elec.,
Inc., 866 F. 2d 228, 236 (CA7 1988) (Posner, J., dissenting).

The Court correctly observes that the antitrust laws do
not permit even a natural monopolist to project its monopoly
power into another market, i. e., to " `exploi[t] his dominant
position in one market to expand his empire into the next.' "
Ante, at 480, n. 29 (quoting Times-Picayune Publishing Co.
v. United States, 345 U. S. 594, 611 (1953)). However, when
a manufacturer uses its control over single-branded parts to
acquire influence in single-branded service, the monopoly
"leverage" is almost invariably of no practical consequence,
because of perfect identity between the consumers in each of
the subject aftermarkets (those who need replacement parts
for Kodak equipment and those who need servicing of Kodak
equipment). When that condition exists, the tie does not
permit the manufacturer to project power over a class of
consumers distinct from that which it is already able to
exploit (and fully) without the inconvenience of the tie.
Cf., e. g., Bowman, Tying Arrangements and the Leverage
Problem, 67 Yale L. J. 19, 21-27 (1957).

We have never before accepted the thesis the Court today
embraces: that a seller's inherent control over the unique

Scalia, J., dissenting
parts for its own brand amounts to "market power" of a char-acter sufficient to permit invocation of the per se rule against

tying. As the Court observes, ante, at 479-481, n. 29, wehave applied the per se rule to manufacturer ties of foremarket equipment to aftermarket derivatives--but only whenthe manufacturer's monopoly power in the equipment, coupled with the use of derivative sales as "counting devices" tomeasure the intensity of customer equipment usage, enabled
the manufacturer to engage in price discrimination, and
thereby more fully exploit its interbrand power. See International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U. S. 392 (1947); International Business Machines Corp. v. United States, 298
U. S. 131 (1936); United Shoe Machinery Corp. v. United
States, 258 U. S. 451 (1922). That sort of enduring opportunity to engage in price discrimination is unavailable to amanufacturer--like Kodak--that lacks power at the interbrand level. A tie between two aftermarket derivativesdoes next to nothing to improve a competitive manufacturer's ability to extract monopoly rents from its consumers.3

3 The Court insists that the record in this case suggests otherwise, i. e.,
that a tie between parts and service somehow does enable Kodak to increase overall monopoly profits. See ante, at 479-481, n. 29. Although
the Court does not identify the record evidence on which it relies, the
suggestion, apparently, is that such a tie facilitates price discrimination
between sophisticated, "high-volume" users of Kodak equipment and their
unsophisticated counterparts. The sophisticated users (who, the Court
presumes, invariably self-service their equipment) are permitted to buy
Kodak parts without also purchasing supracompetitively priced Kodak
service, while the unsophisticated are--through the imposition of the tie--
compelled to buy both. See ante, at 475-476.

While superficially appealing, at bottom this explanation lacks coherence. Whether they self-service their equipment or not, rational foremarket consumers (those consumers who are not yet "locked in" to Kodak
hardware) will be driven to Kodak's competitors if the price of Kodak
equipment, together with the expected cost of aftermarket support, exceeds competitive levels. This will be true no matter how Kodak distributes the total system price among equipment, parts, and service. See

Nor has any court of appeals (save for the Ninth Circuit
panel below) recognized single-branded aftermarket power
as a basis for invoking the per se tying prohibition. See
Virtual Maintenance, Inc. v. Prime Computer, Inc., 957

supra, at 495. Thus, as to these consumers, Kodak's lack of interbrand
power wholly prevents it from employing a tie between parts and service
as a vehicle for price discrimination. Nor does a tie between parts and
service offer Kodak incremental exploitative power over those consumers--sophisticated or not--who have the supposed misfortune of being
"locked in" to Kodak equipment. If Kodak desired to exploit its circumstantial power over this wretched class by pressing them up to the point
where the cost to each consumer of switching equipment brands barely
exceeded the cost of retaining Kodak equipment and remaining subject to
Kodak's abusive practices, it could plainly do so without the inconvenience
of a tie, through supracompetitive parts pricing alone. Since the lockedin sophisticated parts purchaser is as helpless as the locked-in unsophisticated one, I see nothing to be gained by price discrimination in favor of
the former. If such price discrimination were desired, however, it would
not have to be accomplished indirectly, through a tie of parts to service.
Section 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 13(a), would prevent
giving lower parts prices to the sophisticated customers only "where the
effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or
tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy,
or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly
receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of either of
them . . . ." Ibid.; see, e. g., Falls City Industries, Inc. v. Vanco Beverage,
Inc., 460 U. S. 428, 434-435 (1983). That prohibited effect often occurs
when price-discriminated goods are sold for resale (i. e., to purchasers who
are necessarily in competition with one another). E. g., FTC v. Morton
Salt Co., 334 U. S. 37, 47 (1948); see P. Areeda & L. Kaplow, Antitrust
Analysis || 600, p. 923 (1988) ("Secondary-line injury arises [under the
Robinson-Patman Act] when a powerful firm buying supplies at favorable
prices thereby gains a decisive advantage over its competitors that are
forced to pay higher prices for their supplies"). It rarely occurs where, as
would be the case here, the price-discriminated goods are sold to various
businesses for consumption.

We have recognized in closely related contexts that the
deterrent effect of interbrand competition on the exploitation of intrabrand market power should make courts exceedingly reluctant to apply rules of per se illegality to intrabrand restraints. For instance, we have refused to apply a
rule of per se illegality to vertical nonprice restraints "because of their potential for a simultaneous reduction of intrabrand competition and stimulation of interbrand competition," Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S.
36, 51-52 (1977), the latter of which we described as "the
primary concern of antitrust law," id., at 52, n. 19. We
noted, for instance, that "new manufacturers and manufacturers entering new markets can use the restrictions in
order to induce competent and aggressive retailers to make
the kind of investment of capital and labor that is often required in the distribution of products unknown to the consumer," and that "[e]stablished manufacturers can use them

to induce retailers to engage in promotional activities or to
provide service and repair facilities necessary to the efficient
marketing of their products." Id., at 55. See also Business
Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., 485 U. S. 717,
726 (1988). The same assumptions, in my opinion, should
govern our analysis of ties alleged to have been "forced"
solely through intrabrand market power. In the absence of
interbrand power, a manufacturer's bundling of aftermarket
products may serve a multitude of legitimate purposes: It
may facilitate manufacturer efforts to ensure that the equipment remains operable and thus protect the seller's business
reputation, see United States v. Jerrold Electronics Corp.,
187 F. Supp., at 560; it may create the conditions for implicit
consumer financing of the acquisition cost of the tying equipment through supracompetitively-priced aftermarket purchases, see, e. g., A. Oxenfeldt, Industrial Pricing and Market
Practices 378 (1951); and it may, through the resultant manufacturer control of aftermarket activity, "yield valuable information about component or design weaknesses that will
materially contribute to product improvement," 3 Areeda &
Turner || 733c, at 258-259; see also id., || 829d, at 331-332.
Because the interbrand market will generally punish intrabrand restraints that consumers do not find in their interest,
we should not--under the guise of a per se rule--condemn
such potentially procompetitive arrangements simply because of the antitrust defendant's inherent power over the
unique parts for its own brand.

I would instead evaluate the aftermarket tie alleged in
this case under the rule of reason, where the tie's actual
anticompetitive effect in the tied product market, together
with its potential economic benefits, can be fully captured
in the analysis, see, e. g., Jefferson Parish, 466 U. S., at 41
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). Disposition of this
case does not require such an examination, however, as respondents apparently waived any rule-of-reason claim they

may have had in the District Court. I would thus reverse
the Ninth Circuit's judgment on the tying claim outright.

III
These considerations apply equally to respondents' $ 2
claims. An antitrust defendant lacking relevant "market
power" sufficient to permit invocation of the per se prohibition against tying a fortiori lacks the monopoly power that
warrants heightened scrutiny of his allegedly exclusionary
behavior. Without even so much as asking whether the purposes of $ 2 are implicated here, the Court points to Kodak's
control of "100% of the parts market and 80% to 95% of the
service market," markets with "no readily available substitutes," ante, at 481, and finds that the proffer of such statistics is sufficient to fend off summary judgment. But this
showing could easily be made, as I have explained, with respect to virtually any manufacturer of differentiated products requiring aftermarket support. By permitting antitrust plaintiffs to invoke $ 2 simply upon the unexceptional
demonstration that a manufacturer controls the supplies of
its single-branded merchandise, the Court transforms $ 2
from a specialized mechanism for responding to extraordinary agglomerations (or threatened agglomerations) of economic power to an all-purpose remedy against run-of-themill business torts.

In my view, if the interbrand market is vibrant, it is simply
not necessary to enlist $ 2's machinery to police a seller's intrabrand restraints. In such circumstances, the interbrand
market functions as an infinitely more efficient and more precise corrective to such behavior, rewarding the seller whose
intrabrand restraints enhance consumer welfare while punishing the seller whose control of the aftermarkets is viewed
unfavorably by interbrand consumers. See Business Electronics Corp., supra, at 725; Continental T. V., Inc., supra,

505OCTOBER TERM, 1991
Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. THOMPSON/CENTER ARMS CO.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe federal circuit

No. 91-164. Argued January 13, 1992--Decided June 8, 1992
Respondent manufactures the "Contender" pistol and, for a short time,

also manufactured a kit that could be used to convert the Contender
into a rifle with either a 21-inch or a 10-inch barrel. The Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms advised respondent that when the kit
was possessed or distributed with the Contender, the unit constituted a
"firearm" under the National Firearms Act (NFA or Act), 26 U. S. C.

$ 5845(a)(3), which defines that term to include a rifle with a barrel less
than 16 inches long, known as a short-barreled rifle, but not a pistol or
a rifle having a barrel 16 inches or more in length. Respondent paid
the $200 tax levied by $ 5821 upon anyone "making" a "firearm" and
filed a claim for a refund. When its refund claim proved fruitless, respondent brought this suit under the Tucker Act. The Claims Court
entered summary judgment for the Government, but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that a short-barreled rifle "actually must be assembled" in order to be "made" within the NFA's meaning.

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
924 F. 2d 1041, affirmed.

Justice Souter, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice O'Connor, concluded that the Contender and conversion kit when packaged
together have not been "made" into a short-barreled rifle for NFA purposes. Pp. 509-518.

(a) The language of $ 5845(i)--which provides that "[t]he term `make',
and [its] various derivatives . . . , shall include manufacturing . . . ,
putting together . . . , or otherwise producing a firearm"--clearly demonstrates that the aggregation of separate parts that can be assembled
only into a firearm, and the aggregation of a gun other than a firearm
and parts that would have no use in association with the gun except to
convert it into a firearm, constitute the "making" of a firearm. If, as
the Court of Appeals held, a firearm were only made at the time of final
assembly (the moment the firearm was "put together"), the statutory
"manufacturing . . . or otherwise producing" language would be redundant. Thus, Congress must have understood "making" to cover more
than final assembly, and some disassembled aggregation of parts must
be included. Pp. 509-512.

506 UNITED STATES v. THOMPSON/CENTER ARMS CO.

Opinion of Souter, J.
(b) However, application of the ordinary rules of statutory construction shows that the Act is ambiguous as to whether, given the fact that
the Contender can be converted into either an NFA-regulated firearm
or an unregulated rifle, the mere possibility of its use with the kit to
assemble the former renders their combined packaging "making."
Pp. 512-517.

(c) The statutory ambiguity is properly resolved by applying the rule
of lenity in respondent's favor. See, e. g., Crandon v. United States, 494
U. S. 152, 168. Although it is a tax statute that is here construed in a
civil setting, the NFA has criminal applications that carry no additional
requirement of willfulness. Making a firearm without approval may be
subject to criminal sanction, as is possession of, or failure to pay the tax
on, an unregistered firearm. Pp. 517-518.

Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, agreed that the rule of
lenity prevents respondent's pistol and conversion kit from being covered by the NFA, but on the basis of different ambiguities: whether a
firearm includes unassembled parts, and whether the requisite "inten[t]
to be fired from the shoulder" existed as to the short-barrel component. Pp. 519-523.

one "making" a "firearm" as that term is defined in the Act.Neither pistols nor rifles with barrels 16 inches long or

longer are firearms within the NFA definition, but rifles withbarrels less than 16 inches long, known as short-barreled
rifles, are. $ 5845(a)(3). This case presents the questionwhether a gun manufacturer "makes" a short-barreled rifle
when it packages as a unit a pistol together with a kit con-taining a shoulder stock and a 21-inch barrel, permitting the
pistol's conversion into an unregulated long-barreled rifle,1or, if the pistol's barrel is left on the gun, a short-barreled
rifle that is regulated. We hold that the statutory languagemay not be construed to require payment of the tax under
these facts. I

The word "firearm" is used as a term of art in the NFA.It means, among other things, "a rifle having a barrel or
barrels of less than 16 inches in length . . . ." $ 5845(a)(3)."The term `rifle' means a weapon designed or redesigned,
made or remade, and intended to be fired from the shoulderand designed or redesigned and made or remade to use the
energy of the explosive in a fixed cartridge to fire only asingle projectile through a rifled bore for each single pull of
the trigger, and shall include any such weapon which may bereadily restored to fire a fixed cartridge." $ 5845(c).

The consequence of being the maker of a firearm are seri-ous. Section 5821(a) imposes a tax of $200 "for each firearm
made," which "shall be paid by the person making the fire-arm," $ 5821(b). Before one may make a firearm, one must
obtain the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, $ 5822,and $ 5841 requires that the "manufacturer, importer, and
maker . . . register each firearm he manufactures, imports,or makes" in a central registry maintained by the Secretary
of the Treasury. A maker who fails to comply with theNFA's provisions is subject to criminal penalties of up to 10

years' imprisonment and a fine of up to $10,000, or both,
which may be imposed without proof of willfulness or knowledge. $ 5871.

Respondent Thompson/Center Arms Company manufactures a single-shot pistol called the "Contender," designed so
that its handle and barrel can be removed from its "receiver,"
the metal frame housing the trigger, hammer, and firing
mechanism. See 27 CFR $ 179.11 (1991) (definition of frame
or receiver). For a short time in 1985, Thompson/Center
also manufactured a carbine-conversion kit consisting of a
21-inch barrel, a rifle stock, and a wooden fore-end. If one
joins the receiver with the conversion kit's rifle stock, the
21-inch barrel, and the rifle fore-end, the product is a carbine
rifle with a 21-inch barrel. If, however, the shorter, pistollength barrel is not removed from the receiver when the rifle
stock is added, one is left with a 10-inch or "short-barreled"
carbine rifle. The entire conversion, from pistol to longbarreled rifle takes only a few minutes; conversion to a shortbarreled rifle takes even less time.

In 1985, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
advised Thompson/Center that when its conversion kit
was possessed or distributed together with the Contender
pistol, the unit constituted a firearm subject to the NFA.
Thompson/Center responded by paying the $200 tax for a
single such firearm, and submitting an application for permission under 26 U. S. C. $ 5822 "to make, use, and segregate
as a single unit" a package consisting of a serially numbered
pistol, together with an attachable shoulder stock and a
21-inch barrel. Thompson/Center then filed a refund claim.
After more than six months had elapsed without action on
it, the company brought this suit in the United States Claims
Court under the Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1491, arguing that
the unit registered was not a firearm within the meaning of
the NFA because Thompson/Center had not assembled a
short-barreled rifle from its components. The Claims Court

entered summary judgment for the Government, concludingthat the Contender pistol together with its conversion kit is

a firearm within the meaning of the NFA. 19 Cl. Ct. 725(1990).

The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed,holding that a short-barreled rifle "actually must be assembled" in order to be "made" within the meaning of the NFA.924 F. 2d 1041, 1043 (1991). The Court of Appeals expressly
declined to follow the decision of the Court of Appeals forthe Seventh Circuit in

United States v. Drasen, 845 F. 2d731, cert. denied, 488 U. S. 909 (1988), which had held that an

unassembled "complete parts kit" for a short-barreled riflewas in fact a short-barreled rifle for purposes of the NFA.
We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict. 502 U. S.807 (1991).

II
The NFA provides that "[t]he term `make', and the variousderivatives of such word, shall include manufacturing (other

than by one qualified to engage in such business underthis chapter), putting together, altering, any combination
of these, or otherwise producing a firearm." 26 U. S. C.$ 5845(i).

2 But the provision does not expressly address the

question whether a short-barreled rifle can be "made" by theaggregation of finished parts that can readily be assembled

into one. The Government contends that assembly is notnecessary; Thompson/Center argues that it is.

A
The Government urges us to view the shipment of the pis-tol with the kit just as we would the shipment of a bicycle

2 The phrase "other than by one qualified to engage in such business
under this chapter" apparently refers to those manufacturers who have
sought and obtained qualification as a firearms manufacturer under 26
U. S. C. $ 5801(a)(1), which requires payment of a $1,000 occupational tax.
Rather than seek such qualification, Thompson/Center applied for permission to make a firearm as a nonqualified manufacturer under $ 5822, which
requires payment of the $200 per firearm "making tax" under $ 5821(a).

Opinion of Souter, J.
that requires some home assembly. "The fact that a shortbarrel rifle, or any other `firearm,' is possessed or sold in a
partially unassembled state does not remove it from regulation under the Act." Brief for United States 6.

The Government's analogy of the partially assembled bicycle to the packaged pistol and conversion kit is not, of course,
exact. While each example includes some unassembled
parts, the crated bicycle parts can be assembled into nothing
but a bicycle, whereas the contents of Thompson/Center's
package can constitute a pistol, a long-barreled rifle, or a
short-barreled version. These distinctions, however, do define the issues raised by the Government's argument, the
first of which is whether the aggregation and segregation of
separate parts that can be assembled only into a shortbarreled rifle and are sufficient for that purpose amount to
"making" that firearm, or whether the firearm is not "made"
until the moment of final assembly. This is the issue on
which the Federal and Seventh Circuits are divided.

We think the language of the statute provides a clear answer on this point. The definition of "make" includes not
only "putting together," but also "manufacturing . . . or
otherwise producing a firearm." If as Thompson/Center
submits, a firearm were only made at the time of final assembly (the moment the firearm was "put together"), the additional language would be redundant. Congress must, then,
have understood "making" to cover more than final assembly,
and some disassembled aggregation of parts must be included. Since the narrowest example of a combination of
parts that might be included is a set of parts that could be
used to make nothing but a short-barreled rifle, the aggregation of such a set of parts, at the very least, must fall within
the definition of "making" such a rifle.

This is consistent with the holdings of every Court of Appeals, except the court below, to consider a combination of
parts that could only be assembled into an NFA-regulated

firearm, either under the definition of rifle at issue here orunder similar statutory language. See

United States v.

the broad language of the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit to the extent that it would mean that a disassembled
complete short-barreled rifle kit must be assembled before it
has been "made" into a short-barreled rifle. The fact that
the statute would serve almost no purpose if this were the
rule only confirms the reading we have given it.4

We also think that a firearm is "made" on facts one step
removed from the paradigm of the aggregated parts that can
be used for nothing except assembling a firearm. Two
courts to our knowledge have dealt in some way with claims
that when a gun other than a firearm was placed together

3 In Drasen, a complete-parts kit was sold with a flash suppressor,
which, if affixed to the rifle barrel, would have extended it beyond the
regulated length. See Drasen, 845 F. 2d, at 737. Because the Drasen
court concluded that such a flash suppressor was not a part of the rifle's
barrel, see ibid., its holding is consistent with ours.

4 We do not accept the Government's suggestion, however, that

complete-parts kits must be taxable because otherwise manufacturers will
be able to "avoid the tax." Brief for United States 11. Rather, we conclude that such kits are within the definition of the taxable item. Failure
to pay the tax on such a kit thus would amount to evasion, not avoidance.
In our system, avoidance of a tax by remaining outside the ambit of the
law that imposes it is every person's right. "Over and over again courts
have said that there is nothing sinister in so arranging one's affairs as
to keep taxes as low as possible. Everybody does so, rich or poor; and
all do right, for nobody owes any public duty to pay more than the law
demands: taxes are enforced exactions, not voluntary contributions. To
demand more in the name of morals is mere cant." Commissioner v.
Newman, 159 F. 2d 848, 850-851 (CA2) (L. Hand, J., dissenting), cert. denied, 331 U. S. 859 (1947).

with a further part or parts that would have had no use inassociation with the gun except to convert it into a firearm,

a firearm was produced. See United States v. Kokin, 365F. 2d 595, 596 (CA3) (carbine together with all parts necessary to convert it into a machinegun is a machinegun), cert.denied, 385 U. S. 987 (1966); see also

United States v. Zeid-man, 444 F. 2d 1051, 1053 (CA7 1971) (pistol and attachable

shoulder stock found "in different drawers of the samedresser" constitute a short-barreled rifle). Here it is true,
of course, that some of the parts could be used without everassembling a firearm, but the likelihood of that is belied by
the utter uselessness of placing the converting parts withthe others except for just such a conversion. Where the evidence in a given case supports a finding of such uselessness,the case falls within the fair intendment of "otherwise producing a firearm." See 26 U. S. C. $ 5845(i).5

B
Here, however, we are not dealing with an aggregation ofparts that can serve no useful purpose except the assembly

5 Contrary to Justice Scalia's suggestion, see post, at 522, our understanding of these aggregations of parts, shared by a majority of the Court
(those who join this opinion and the four Members of the Court in dissent,
see post, p. 523 (White, J., joined by Blackmun, Stevens, and Kennedy,
JJ., dissenting) (any aggregation of parts necessary to assemble a firearm
is a firearm)), applies to all the provisions of the Act, whether they regulate the "making" of a firearm, e. g., 26 U. S. C. $ 5821(a), or not, see, e. g.,

$ 5842(b) (possession of a firearm that has no serial number); $ 5844 (importation of a firearm); $ 5811 (transfer of a firearm). Since, as we conclude,
such a combination of parts, or of a complete gun and an additional part
or parts, is "made" into a firearm, it follows, in the absence of some reason
to the contrary, that all portions of the Act that apply to "firearms" apply
to such a combination. Justice Scalia does not explain how we would
be free to construe "firearm" in a different way for purposes of those
provisions that do not contain the verb "to make." Our normal canons of
construction caution us to read the statute as a whole, and, unless there
is a good reason, to adopt a consistent interpretation of a term used in
more than one place within a statute.

of a firearm, or with an aggregation having no ostensibleutility except to convert a gun into such a weapon. There

is, to be sure, one resemblance to the latter example in thesale of the Contender with the converter kit, for packaging
the two has no apparent object except to convert the pistolinto something else at some point. But the resemblance
ends with the fact that the unregulated Contender pistol canbe converted not only into a short-barreled rifle, which is a
regulated firearm, but also into a long-barreled rifle, whichis not. The packaging of pistol and kit has an obvious utility
for those who want both a pistol and a regular rifle, andthe question is whether the mere possibility of their use to
assemble a regulated firearm is enough to place their com-bined packaging within the scope of "making" one.

Neither the statute's language nor its structure providesany definitive guidance. Thompson/Center suggests guidance may be found in some subsections of the statute gov-erning other types of weapons by language that expressly
covers combinations of parts. The definition of "machine-gun," for example, was amended by the Gun Control Act of

6 Thompson/Center suggests that further enquiry could be avoided when
it contends that the Contender and carbine kit do not amount to a "rifle"
of any kind because, until assembled into a rifle, they are not " `made' and
`intended to be fired from the shoulder.' " Brief for Respondent 8. From
what we have said thus far, however, it is apparent that, though disassembled, the parts included when the Contender and its carbine kit are packaged together have been "made" into a rifle. The inclusion of the rifle
stock in the package brings the Contender and carbine kit within the "intended to be fired from the shoulder" language contained in the definition
of rifle in the statute. See 26 U. S. C. $ 5845(c). The only question is
whether this combination of parts constitutes a short-barreled rifle.
Surely Justice Scalia's argument would take us over the line between
lenity and credulity when he suggests that one who makes what would
otherwise be a short-barreled rifle could escape liability by carving a
warning into the shoulder stock. See post, at 523 (Scalia, J., concurring
in judgment).

1968 to read that "[t]he term shall also include . . . any combi-nation of parts from which a machinegun can be assembled

if such parts are in the possession or under the control ofa person." 26 U. S. C. $ 5845(b).

7 In 1986, the definition of

"silencer" was amended by the Firearms Owners' ProtectionAct to "includ[e] any combination of parts, designed or redesigned, and intended for use in assembling or fabricatinga firearm silencer . . . ." See 26 U. S. C. $ 5845(a)(7); 18
U. S. C. $ 921(a)(24).Thompson/Center stresses the contrast between these references to "any combination of parts" and the silence about
parts in the definition of rifle in arguing that no aggregationof parts can suffice to make the regulated rifle. This argument is subject to a number of answers, however. First, it
sweeps so broadly as to conflict with the statutory definitionof "make," applicable to all firearms, which implies that a

firearm may be "made" even where not fully "put together."If this were all, of course, the conflict might well be resolved
in Thompson/Center's favor. We do not, however, read themachinegun and silencer definitions as contrasting with the
definition of rifle in such a way as to raise a conflict with thebroad concept of "making."

The definition of "silencer" is now included in the NFA
only by reference, see 26 U. S. C. $ 5845(a)(7), whereas itstext appears only at 18 U. S. C. $ 921(a)(24), in a statute that

itself contains no definition of "make." Prior to 1986 thedefinition of "firearm" in the NFA included "a muffler or a
silencer for any firearm whether or not such firearm is in-cluded within this definition." 26 U. S. C. $ 5845(a)(7) (1982
ed.). Two Courts of Appeals held this language to include

7 At the same time, the definition of "destructive device" was amended
to include "any combination of parts either designed or intended for use
in converting any device into a destructive device . . . and from which a
destructive device may readily be assembled." 26 U. S. C. $ 5845(f).
This appears to envision by its terms only combinations of parts for converting something into a destructive device.

unassembled silencers that could be readily and easily assembled. See United States v. Endicott, 803 F. 2d, at 508-
509; United States v. Luce, 726 F. 2d, at 48-49.

In 1986, Congress replaced that language with "any silencer (as defined in section 921 of title 18, United States
Code)." Pub. L. 99-308, $ 109(b), 100 Stat. 460. The language defining silencer that was added to 18 U. S. C. $ 921 at
that same time reads: "The terms `firearm silencer' and
`firearm muffler' mean any device for silencing, muffling, or
diminishing the report of a portable firearm, including any
combination of parts, designed or redesigned, and intended
for use in assembling or fabricating a firearm silencer or
firearm muffler, and any part intended only for use in such
assembly or fabrication." Pub. L. 99-308, $ 101, 100 Stat.
451.

Thompson/Center argues that if, even before the amendment, a combination of parts was already "made" into a firearm, the "any combination of parts" language would be
redundant. While such a conclusion of redundancy could
suggest that Congress assumed that "make" in the NFA did
not cover unassembled parts, the suggestion (and the implied
conflict with our reading of "make") is proven false by evidence that Congress actually understood redundancy to result from its new silencer definition. Congress apparently
assumed that the statute reached complete-parts kits even
without the "combination" language and understood the net
effect of the new definition as expanding the coverage of the
Act beyond complete-parts kits. "The definition of silencer
is amended to include any part designed or redesigned and
intended to be used as a silencer for a firearm. This will
help to control the sale of incomplete silencer kits that now
circumvent the prohibition on selling complete kits." H. R.
Rep. No. 99-495, p. 21 (1986). Because the addition of the
"combination of parts" language to the definition of silencer
does not, therefore, bear the implication Thompson/Center

would put on it, that definition cannot give us much guidancein answering the question before us.

We get no more help from analyzing the machinegun defi-nition's reference to parts. It speaks of "any combination"

of them in the possession or control of any one person. Herethe definition sweeps broader than the aggregation of parts
clearly covered by "making" a rifle. The machinegun partsneed not even be in any particular proximity to each other.
There is thus no conflict between definitions, but neither ismuch light shed on the limits of "making" a short-barreled
rifle. We can only say that the notion of an unassembledmachinegun is probably broader than that of an unassembled
rifle. But just where the line is to be drawn on short-barreled rifles is not demonstrated by textual considerations.

Thompson/Center also looks for the answer in the purposeand history of the NFA, arguing that the congressional purpose behind the NFA, of regulating weapons useful for crimi-nal purposes, should caution against drawing the line in such
a way as to apply the Act to the Contender pistol and carbinekit. See H. R. Rep. No. 1337, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., A395

shrine, however, is well peopled (though it has room for one more) and its
congregation has included such noted elders as Justice Frankfurter: "A
statute, like other living organisms, derives significance and sustenance
from its environment, from which it cannot be severed without being mutilated. Especially is this true where the statute, like the one before us, is
part of a legislative process having a history and a purpose. The meaning
of such a statute cannot be gained by confining inquiry within its four
corners. Only the historic process of which such legislation is an incomplete fragment--that to which it gave rise as well as that which gave rise
to it--can yield its true meaning." United States v. Monia, 317 U. S. 424,

tors, "in pursuance of the clearly indicated congressional in-tent to cover under the National Firearms Act only such

modern and lethal weapons, except pistols and revolvers,as could be used readily and efficiently by criminals or
gangsters").It is of course clear from the face of the Act that the NFA's
object was to regulate certain weapons likely to be used forcriminal purposes, just as the regulation of short-barreled
rifles, for example, addresses a concealable weapon likely tobe so used. But when Thompson/Center urges us to recognize that "the Contender pistol and carbine kit is not acriminal-type weapon," Brief for Respondent 20, it does not
really address the issue of where the line should be drawn indeciding what combinations of parts are "made" into shortbarreled rifles. Its argument goes to the quite differentissue whether the single-shot Contender should be treated
as a firearm within the meaning of the Act even when assem-bled with a rifle stock.

Since Thompson/Center's observations on this extraneousissue shed no light on the limits of unassembled "making"
under the Act, we will say no more about congressional pur-pose. Nor are we helped by the NFA's legislative history,
in which we find nothing to support a conclusion one way orthe other about the narrow issue presented here.

III
After applying the ordinary rules of statutory construc-tion, then, we are left with an ambiguous statute. The key

to resolving the ambiguity lies in recognizing that althoughit is a tax statute that we construe now in a civil setting,
the NFA has criminal applications that carry no additionalrequirement of willfulness. Cf. Cheek v. United States, 498
U. S. 192, 200 (1991) ("Congress has . . . softened the impactof the common-law presumption [that ignorance of the law

tax offenses"); 26 U. S. C. $$ 7201, 7203 (criminalizing will-ful evasion of taxes and willful failure to file a return). Making a firearm without approval may be subject to criminalsanction, as is possession of an unregistered firearm and
failure to pay the tax on one, 26 U. S. C. $$ 5861, 5871. Itis proper, therefore, to apply the rule of lenity and resolve
the ambiguity in Thompson/Center's favor. See Crandonv.

United States, 494 U. S. 152, 168 (1990) (applying lenityin interpreting a criminal statute invoked in a civil action); Commissioner v. Acker, 361 U. S. 87, 91 (1959).9 Ac-cordingly, we conclude that the Contender pistol and carbine
kit when packaged together by Thompson/Center have notbeen "made" into a short-barreled rifle for purposes of the
NFA.10 The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore

Affirmed.
9 The Government has urged us to defer to an agency interpretation
contained in two longstanding Revenue Rulings. Even if they were entitled to deference, neither of the rulings, Rev. Rul. 61-45, 1961-1 Cum.
Bull. 663, and Rev. Rul. 61-203, 1961-2 Cum. Bull. 224 (same), goes to the
narrow question presented here, addressing rather the question whether
pistols with short barrels and attachable shoulder stocks are shortbarreled rifles. We do not read the Government to be relying upon Rev.
Rul. 54-606, 1954-2 Cum. Bull. 33, which was repealed as obsolete in 1972,
Rev. Rul. 72-178, 1972-1 Cum. Bull. 423, and which contained broader
language that "possession or control of sufficient parts to assemble an operative firearm . . . constitutes the possession of a firearm." Reply Brief
for United States 10.

10 Justice Stevens contends that lenity should not be applied because

this is a " `tax statute,' " post, at 526, rather than a "criminal statute," see
post, at 525, n. 1, quoting Crandon v. United States, 494 U. S. 152, 168
(1990). But this tax statute has criminal applications, and we know of no
other basis for determining when the essential nature of a statute is "criminal." Surely, Justice Stevens cannot mean to suggest that in order for
the rule of lenity to apply, the statute must be contained in the Criminal
Code. See, e. g., United States v. Universal C. I. T. Credit Corp., 344 U. S.
218, 221-222 (1952) (construing the criminal provisions of the Fair Labor
Standards Act, 29 U. S. C. $$ 215, 216(a)). Justice Stevens further suggests that lenity is inappropriate because we construe the statute today

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,
concurring in the judgment.

I agree with the plurality that the application of the National Firearms Act (NFA) to Thompson/Center's pistol and
conversion kit is sufficiently ambiguous to trigger the rule of
lenity, leading to the conclusion that the kit is not covered.
I disagree with the plurality, however, over where the ambiguity lies--a point that makes no difference to the outcome
here, but will make considerable difference in future cases.
The plurality thinks the ambiguity pertains to whether the
making of a regulated firearm includes (i) the manufacture of
parts kits that can possibly be used to assemble a regulated
firearm, or rather includes only (ii) the manufacture of parts
kits that serve no useful purpose except assembly of a regulated firearm. Ante, at 512-513, 517. I think the ambiguity
pertains to the much more fundamental point of whether

the making of a regulated firearm includes the manufacture,
without assembly, of component parts where the definition
of the particular firearm does not so indicate.

As Justice White points out, the choice the plurality
worries about is nowhere suggested by the language of the
statute: $ 5845 simply makes no reference to the " `utility' "
of aggregable parts. Post, at 524 (dissenting opinion). It
does, however, conspicuously combine references to "combination of parts" in the definitions of regulated silencers, machineguns, and destructive devices with the absence of any
such reference in the definition of regulated rifles. This,
rather than the utility or not of a given part in a given parts
assemblage, convinces me that the provision does not encom" `in a civil setting,' " rather than a "criminal prosecution." Post, at 526.
The rule of lenity, however, is a rule of statutory construction whose purpose is to help give authoritative meaning to statutory language. It is
not a rule of administration calling for courts to refrain in criminal cases
from applying statutory language that would have been held to apply if
challenged in civil litigation.

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
pass Thompson/Center's pistol and conversion kit, or at leastdoes not do so unambiguously.

The plurality reaches its textually uncharted destinationby determining that the statutory definition of "make," the
derivative of which appears as an operative word in 26
U. S. C. $ 5821 ("There shall be levied, collected, and paidupon the making of a firearm a tax at the rate of $200 for

each firearm made"), covers the making of parts that, assem-bled, are firearms. Noting that the "definition of `make' includes not only `putting together,' but also `manufacturing. . . or otherwise producing a firearm,' " the plurality reasons
that if "a firearm were only made at the time of final assembly (the moment the firearm was `put together'), the additional language would be redundant." Ante, at 510.

This reasoning seems to me mistaken. I do not think that
if "making" requires "putting together," other language of
the definition section ("manufacturing" and "otherwise producing") becomes redundant. "Manufacturing" is qualified
by the parenthetical phrase "(other than by one qualified to
engage in such business under this chapter)," whereas "putting together" is not. Thus, one who assembles a firearm
and also engages in the prior activity of producing the component parts can be immunized from being considered to be
making firearms by demonstrating the relevant qualification,
whereas one who merely assembles parts manufactured by
others cannot. Recognition of this distinction is alone
enough to explain the separate inclusion of "putting together," even though "manufacturing" itself includes assembly. As for the phrase "otherwise producing," that may well
be redundant, but such residual provisions often are. They
are often meant for insurance, to cover anything the draftsman might inadvertently have omitted in the antecedent catalog; and if the draftsman is good enough, he will have omitted nothing at all. They are a prime example of provisions
in which "iteration is obviously afoot," Moskal v. United
States, 498 U. S. 103, 120 (1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting), and

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
for which an inflexible rule of avoiding redundancy willproduce disaster. In any event, the plurality's own interpretation (whereby "manufacturing" a firearm does not requireassembling it, and "putting together" is an entirely separate
category of "making") renders it not a bit easier to conceive
of a nonredundant application for "otherwise producing."The plurality struggles to explain why its interpretation

("making" does not require assembly of component parts)does not

itself render redundant the "combination of parts"
language found elsewhere in 26 U. S. C. $ 5845, in the defini-tions of machinegun and destructive device, $$ 5845(b) and

(f), and in the incorporated-by-reference definition of silencer, $ 5845(a)(7) (referring to 18 U. S. C. $ 921). See ante,
at 513-516. I do not find its explanations persuasive, particularly that with respect to silencer, which resorts to that last
hope of lost interpretive causes, that St. Jude of the hagiology of statutory construction, legislative history. As I have
said before, reliance on that source is particularly inappropriate in determining the meaning of a statute with criminal application. United States v. R. L. C., 503 U. S. 291,
307 (1992) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in
judgment).

There is another reason why the plurality's interpretation
is incorrect: It determines what constitutes a regulated
"firearm" via an operative provision of the NFA (here $ 5821,
the making tax) rather than by way of $ 5845, which defines
firearms covered by the chapter. With respect to the definitions of machineguns, destructive devices, and silencers,
for instance, the reference to "combination of parts" causes
parts aggregations to be firearms whenever those nouns are
used, and not just when they are used in conjunction with
the verb "make" and its derivatives. Thus, the restrictions
of $ 5844, which regulate the importation of "firearm[s]" (a
term defined to include "machinegun[s]," see $ 5845(a)(6)),
apply to a "combination of parts from which a machinegun
can be assembled" (because that is part of the definition of

522 UNITED STATES v. THOMPSON/CENTER ARMS CO.

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
machinegun) even though the word "make" and its deriva-tives do not appear in $ 5844. This demonstrates, I say, the

error of the plurality's interpretation, because it makes nosense to have the firearms regulated by the NFA bear one
identity (which includes components of rifles and shotguns)
when they are the object of the verb "make," and a differentidentity (excluding such components) when they are not.

Section 5842(a), for example, requires anyone "making" afirearm to identify it with a serial number that may not be
readily removed; $ 5842(b) requires any person who "pos-sesses" a firearm lacking the requisite serial number to identify it with one assigned by the Secretary of the Treasury.Under the plurality's interpretation, all the firearms covered
by (a) are not covered by (b), since a person who "possesses"
the components for a rifle or shotgun does not possess a fire-arm, even though a person who "makes" the components for

a rifle or shotgun makes a firearm. For similar reasons, the
tax imposed on "the making of a firearm" by $ 5821 would
apply to the making of components for rifles and shotguns,
but the tax imposed on "firearms transferred" by $ 5811
would not apply to the transfer of such components. This
cannot possibly be right.*

Finally, even if it were the case that unassembled parts
could constitute a rifle, I do not think it was established in

*The plurality, as I read its opinion, relies on the derivative of "make"
that appears in $ 5821, not that appearing (in a quite different context) in
the definition of "rifle." See 26 U. S. C. $ 5845(c) ("The term `rifle' means
a weapon designed or redesigned, made or remade . . ."). I think it would
not be possible to rely upon the use of "made" in $ 5845(c), where the
context is obviously suggestive of assembled rather than unassembled rifles. But even if the plurality means to apply its interpretation of "make"
to $ 5845(c), it still does not entirely avoid the problem I have identified.
The definition of "any other weapon," another in $ 5845's arsenal of defined
firearms, does not contain relevant uses of the verb "make" or any derivative thereof. See 26 U. S. C. $ 5845(e). It necessarily follows that "any
other weapon" will mean one thing when a making tax is at hand but
something else when a transfer tax is.

this case that respondent manufactured (assembled or not) arifle "having a barrel or barrels of less than 16 inches in

length," which is what the definition of "firearm" requires,$ 5845(a)(3). For the definition of "rifle" requires that it be
"intended to be fired from the shoulder," $ 5845(c), and the
only combination of parts so intended, as far as respondentis concerned (and the record contains no indication of anyone

else's intent), is the combination that forms a rifle with a21-inch barrel. The kit's instructions emphasized that legal
sanctions attached to the unauthorized making of a short-barreled rifle, and there was even carved into the shoulder
stock itself the following: "WARNING. FEDERAL LAWPROHIBITS USE WITH BARREL LESS THAN 16
INCHES."

Since I agree (for a different reason) that the rule of lenity
prevents these kits from being considered firearms within
the meaning of the NFA, I concur in the judgment of the
Court.

Justice White, with whom Justice Blackmun, Justice
Stevens, and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.

The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit concluded
that, to meet the definition of "firearm" under the National
Firearms Act (NFA), 26 U. S. C. $ 5845(a)(3), "a shortbarreled rifle actually must be assembled." 924 F. 2d 1041,
1043 (1991) (footnote omitted). I agree with the plurality
that this pinched interpretation of the statute would fail to
accord the term "make" its full meaning as that term is defined, $ 5845(i), and used in the definition of the term "rifle,"

$ 5845(c). Because one "makes" a firearm not only in the
actual "putting together" of the parts, but also by "manufacturing . . . or otherwise producing a firearm," Congress
clearly intended that the "making" include a "disassembled
aggregation of parts," ante, at 510, where the assemblage of
such parts results in a firearm. In short, when the components necessary to assemble a rifle are produced and held in

conjunction with one another, a "rifle" is, not surprisingly,the result.

This was the difficult issue presented by this case, and itsresolution, for me, is dispositive, as respondent Thompson/
Center concedes that it manufactures and distributes together a collection of parts that may be readily assembledinto a short-barreled rifle. Indeed, Thompson/Center's argument concerning statutory construction, as well as its ap-peal to the rule of lenity, does not suggest, nor does any case
brought to our attention, that one may escape the tax andregistration requirements the NFA imposes on those who
"make" regulated rifles simply by distributing as part of the
package other interchangeable pieces of sufficient design to
avoid the regulated definition. The plurality nevertheless
draws an artificial line between, on the one hand, those parts
that "can serve no useful purpose except the assembly of a
firearm" or that have "no ostensible utility except to convert
a gun into such a weapon," and, on the other hand, those
parts that have "an obvious utility for those who want both
a pistol and a regular rifle." Ante, at 512-513.

I cannot agree. Certainly the statute makes no distinction based on the "utility" of the extra parts. While the
plurality prefers to view this silence as creating ambiguity,
I find it only to signal that such distinctions are irrelevant.
To conclude otherwise is to resort to " `ingenuity to create
ambiguity' " that simply does not exist in this statute.
United States v. James, 478 U. S. 597, 604 (1986), quoting
Rothschild v. United States, 179 U. S. 463, 465 (1900). As
noted by the Government, when a weapon comes within the
scope of the "firearm" definition, the fact that it may also
have a nonregulated form provides no basis for failing to
comply with the requirements of the NFA. Brief for United
States 13-14.

The Court today thus closes one loophole--one cannot circumvent the NFA simply by offering an unassembled collection of parts--only to open another of equal dimension--one

can circumvent the NFA by offering a collection of parts thatcan be made either into a "firearm" or an unregulated rifle.

I respectfully dissent.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
If this were a criminal case in which the defendant did nothave adequate notice of the Government's interpretation of

an ambiguous statute, then it would be entirely appropriateto apply the rule of lenity.

1 I am persuaded, however, that

the Court has misapplied that rule to this quite differentcase.

I agree with Justice White, see ante, at 523-524, andalso with the plurality, see ante, at 511, that respondent has
made a firearm even though it has not assembled its constit-uent parts. I also agree with

Justice White that thatshould be the end of the case, see ante, at 524, and therefore,

I join his opinion. I add this comment, however, because Iam persuaded that the Government should prevail even if
the statute were ambiguous.The main function of the rule of lenity is to protect citizens
from the unfair application of ambiguous punitive statutes.Obviously, citizens should not be subject to punishment without fair notice that their conduct is prohibited by law.2 The

as we have already observed, we are construing a criminal statute and
are therefore bound to consider application of the rule of lenity. To the
extent that any ambiguity over the temporal scope of [18 U. S. C.] $ 209(a)
remains, it should be resolved in petitioners' favor unless and until Congress plainly states that we have misconstrued its intent"); Commissioner

2 Ambiguity in a criminal statute is resolved in favor of the defendant

because " `a fair warning should be given to the world in language that
the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a
certain line is passed' " and because "of the seriousness of criminal penalties, and because criminal punishment usually represents the moral con504us2$83M 04-11-96 15:58:07 PAGES OPINPGT

risk that this respondent would be the victim of such unfair-ness, is, however, extremely remote. In 1985, the Government properly advised respondent of its reading of thestatute and gave it ample opportunity to challenge that reading in litigation in which nothing more than tax liability of$200 was at stake. See 924 F. 2d 1041, 1042-1043 (CA Fed.
1991). Moreover, a proper construction of the statute in thiscase would entirely remove the risk of criminal liability in
the future.The plurality, after acknowledging that this case involves
"a tax statute" and its construction "in a civil setting," ante,at 517, nevertheless proceeds to treat the case as though it
were a criminal prosecution. In my view, the Court shouldapproach this case like any other civil case testing the Government's interpretation of an important regulatory statute.This statute serves the critical objective of regulating the
manufacture and distribution of concealable firearms--dan-gerous weapons that are a leading cause of countless crimes
that occur every day throughout the Nation. This is a fieldthat has long been subject to pervasive governmental regulation because of the dangerous nature of the product andthe public interest in having that danger controlled.

public interest in carrying out the purposes that motivatedthe enactment of this statute is, in my judgment and on this

record, far more compelling than a mechanical application ofthe rule of lenity.

Accordingly, for this reason, as well as for the reasonsstated by

SOCHOR v. FLORIDA
certiorari to the supreme court of florida

No. 91-5843. Argued March 2, 1992--Decided June 8, 1992
After a Florida jury found petitioner Sochor guilty of capital murder, the

jury was instructed at the penalty hearing on the possibility of finding
four aggravating factors, including the State's "heinousness" and "coldness" factors. The jury was also charged with weighing any mitigating
circumstances it might find against the aggravating ones in reaching an
advisory verdict as to whether Sochor's sentence should be life imprisonment or death. The jury's recommendation of death was adopted by
the trial court, which found all four aggravating circumstances defined
in the jury instructions and no mitigating circumstances. The State
Supreme Court held, among other things, that the question whether the
jury instruction on the heinousness factor was unconstitutionally vague
had been waived for failure to object. The court also held that the
evidence failed to support the trial judge's finding of the coldness factor,
but nevertheless affirmed the death sentence.

Held:

1. The application of the heinousness factor to Sochor did not result
in reversible error. Pp. 532-537.

(a) In a weighing State like Florida, Eighth Amendment error occurs when the sentencer weighs an "invalid" aggravating factor in
reaching the decision to impose a death sentence. See Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738, 752. While federal law does not require the
state appellate court reviewing such error to remand for resentencing,
the court must, short of remand, either itself reweigh without the invalid
aggravating factor or determine that weighing the invalid factor was
harmless error. See, e. g., Parker v. Dugger, 498 U. S. 308, 321. P. 532.

(b) This Court lacks jurisdiction to address Sochor's claim that the
jury instruction on the heinousness factor was unconstitutionally vague.
The State Supreme Court indicated with requisite clarity that its rejection of the claim was based on an alternative state ground, see, e. g.,
Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1041, and Sochor has said nothing to
persuade the Court that this state ground is either not adequate or not
independent, see Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U. S. 117, 125-126. Pp. 533-534.

(c) No Eighth Amendment violation occurred when the trial judge
weighed the heinousness factor. Although the State Supreme Court's
recent decisions may have evinced inconsistent and overbroad constructions of the heinousness factor that leave trial judges without sufficient

528 SOCHOR v. FLORIDA

Syllabus
guidance in other factual situations, that court has consistently held that
heinousness is properly found where, as here, the defendant strangled a
conscious victim. Under Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 653, it must
be presumed that the trial judge in the case at hand was familiar with
this body of case law, which, at a minimum, gave the judge "some guidance," id., at 654. This is all that the Eighth Amendment requires.
Pp. 535-537.

2. The application of the coldness factor to Sochor constituted Eighth
Amendment error that went uncorrected in the State Supreme Court.
Pp. 538-541.

(a) Sochor's claim that an Eighth Amendment violation occurred
when the jury "weighed" the coldness factor is rejected. Because,
under Florida law, the jury does not reveal the aggravating factors on
which it relies, it cannot be known whether the jury actually relied on
the coldness factor here. This Court will not presume that a general
verdict rests on a ground that the evidence does not support. Griffin
v. United States, 502 U. S. 46, 59-60. P. 538.

(b) However, Eighth Amendment error occurred when the trial
judge weighed the coldness factor. In Florida, the judge is at least a
constituent part of the "sentencer" for Clemons purposes, and there is
no doubt that the judge "weighed" the coldness factor in this case. Nor
is there any question that the factor was "invalid" for Clemons purposes, since the State Supreme Court found it to be unsupported by the
evidence. See Parker, supra, at 311. Pp. 538-539.

(c) The State Supreme Court did not cure the Eighth Amendment
error. That court generally does not reweigh evidence independently.
See, e. g., Parker, supra, at 319. Nor did that court support the death
verdict by performing harmless-error analysis, since its opinion fails to
mention "harmless error" and expressly refers to the quite different
enquiry whether Sochor's sentence was proportional, and since only one
of the four cases cited by the court contained explicit harmless-error
language. Pp. 539-540.

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
Under Florida law, after a defendant is found guilty of cap-ital murder, a separate jury proceeding is held as the first of

two steps in deciding whether his sentence should be lifeimprisonment or death. Fla. Stat. $ 921.141(1) (1991). At
the close of such aggravating and mitigating evidence as theprosecution and the defense may introduce, the trial judge
charges the jurors to weigh whatever aggravating and mitigating circumstances or factors they may find, and to reachan advisory verdict by majority vote. $ 921.141(2). The

jury does not report specific findings of aggravating and miti-gating circumstances, but if, at the second sentencing step,
the judge decides upon death, he must issue a written state-ment of the circumstances he finds. $ 921.141(3). A death
sentence is then subject to automatic review by the SupremeCourt of Florida. $ 921.141(4).

A Florida trial court sentenced petitioner to death after
a jury so recommended, and the Supreme Court of Floridaaffirmed. We must determine whether, as petitioner claims,

the sentencer in his case weighed either of two aggravatingfactors that he claims were invalid, and if so, whether the
State Supreme Court cured the error by holding it harmless.

530 SOCHOR v. FLORIDA

Opinion of the Court
We answer yes to the first question and no to the second,and therefore vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of

Florida and remand. I

On New Year's Eve 1981, petitioner Dennis Sochor met awoman in a bar in Broward County, Florida. Sochor tried
to rape her after they had left together, and her resistanceangered him to the point of choking her to death. He was
indicted for first-degree murder and kidnaping and, after ajury trial, was found guilty of each offense.

At the penalty hearing, aggravating and mitigating evi-dence was offered, and the jury was instructed on the possibility of finding four aggravating circumstances, two of whichwere that

"the crime for which the defendant is to be sentencedwas especially wicked, evil, atrocious or cruel, and [that]
the crime for which the defendant is to be sentencedwas committed in a cold, calculated and premeditated
manner, without any pretense of moral or legal justifi-cation." App. 326-327.

The judge then explained to the jury that it could find certainstatutory and any nonstatutory mitigating circumstances,
which were to be weighed against any aggravating ones.By a vote of 10 to 2, the jury recommended the death penalty for the murder. The trial court adopted the jury's rec-ommendation, finding all four aggravating circumstances as
defined in the jury instructions and no circumstances inmitigation.

The Supreme Court of Florida affirmed. 580 So. 2d 595(1991). It declined to reverse for unconstitutional vagueness in the trial judge's instruction that the jury could findas an aggravating factor that "the crime for which the
defendant is to be sentenced was especially wicked, evil,atrocious or cruel" (hereinafter, for brevity, the heinousness
factor, after the statute's words "heinous, atrocious, or

in any event. 580 So. 2d, at 602-603, and n. 10. The courtalso rejected Sochor's claim of insufficient evidence to support the trial judge's finding of the heinousness factor, citingevidence of the victim's extreme anxiety and fear before she
died. The State Supreme Court did agree with Sochor,however, that the evidence failed to support the trial judge's
finding that "the crime . . . was committed in a cold, calcu-lated, and premeditated manner without any pretense of
moral or legal justification" (hereinafter the coldness factor),holding this factor to require a "heightened" degree of premeditation not shown in this case. Id., at 603. The StateSupreme Court affirmed the death sentence notwithstanding
the error, saying that:

"[1] We . . . disagree with Sochor's claim that his deathsentence is disproportionate. [2] The trial court carefully weighed the aggravating factors against the lackof any mitigating factors and concluded that death was
warranted. [3] Even after removing the aggravatingfactor of cold, calculated, and premeditated there still
remain three aggravating factors to be weighed againstno mitigating circumstances. [4] Striking one aggravating factor when there are no mitigating circum-stances does not necessarily require resentencing.

we find Sochor's sentence of death proportionate to hiscrime.

532 SOCHOR v. FLORIDA

Opinion of the Court
Sochor petitioned for a writ of certiorari, raising four ques-tions. We granted review limited to the following two: (1)

"Did the application of Florida's [heinousness factor] violatethe Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments?" and (2) "Did the
Florida Supreme Court's review of petitioner's death sen-tence violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments where
that court upheld the sentence even though the trial courthad instructed the jury on, and had applied, an improper aggravating circumstance, [in that] the Florida Supreme Courtdid not reweigh the evidence or conduct a harmless error
analysis as to the effect of improper use of the circumstanceon the jury's penalty verdict?" Pet. for Cert. ii; see 502
U. S. 967 (1991). II

In a weighing State like Florida, there is Eighth Amend-ment error when the sentencer weighs an "invalid" aggravating circumstance in reaching the ultimate decision to im-pose a death sentence. See Clemons v. Mississippi, 494
U. S. 738, 752 (1990). Employing an invalid aggravating fac-tor in the weighing process "creates the possibility . . . of
randomness," Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S. 222, 236 (1992), byplacing a "thumb [on] death's side of the scale," id., at 232,
thus "creat[ing] the risk [of] treat[ing] the defendant as moredeserving of the death penalty,"

id., at 235. Even whenother valid aggravating factors exist, merely affirming a sentence reached by weighing an invalid aggravating factor de-prives a defendant of "the individualized treatment that
would result from actual reweighing of the mix of mitigatingfactors and aggravating circumstances." Clemons, supra,
at 752 (citing Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978), and Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982)); see Parker v. Dug-ger, 498 U. S. 308, 321 (1991). While federal law does not

require the state appellate court to remand for resentencing,it must, short of remand, either itself reweigh without the
invalid aggravating factor or determine that weighing theinvalid factor was harmless error. Id., at 320.

533Cite as: 504 U. S. 527 (1992)
Opinion of the Court

A
Florida's capital sentencing statute allows application of
the heinousness factor if "[t]he capital felony was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel." Fla. Stat. $ 921.141(5)(h)
(1991). Sochor first argues that the jury instruction on the
heinousness factor was invalid in that the statutory definition is unconstitutionally vague, see Maynard v. Cartwright,
486 U. S. 356 (1988); Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420 (1980),
and the instruction failed to narrow the meaning enough to
cure the defect. This error goes to the ultimate sentence,
Sochor claims, because a Florida jury is "the sentencer" for
Clemons purposes, or at the least one of "the sentencer's"
constituent elements. This is so because the trial judge
does not render wholly independent judgment, but must accord deference to the jury's recommendation. See Tedder v.
State, 322 So. 2d 908, 910 (Fla. 1975) (life verdict); Grossman
v. State, 525 So. 2d 833, 839, n. 1 (Fla. 1988) (death verdict),
cert. denied, 489 U. S. 1071 (1989). Hence, the argument
runs, error at the jury stage taints a death sentence, even if
the trial judge's decision is otherwise error free. Cf. Baldwin v. Alabama, 472 U. S. 372, 382 (1985). While Sochor
concedes that the general advisory jury verdict does not reveal whether the jury did find and weigh the heinousness
factor, he seems to argue that the possibility that the jury
weighed an invalid factor is enough to require cure.

This argument faces a hurdle, however, in the rule that
this Court lacks jurisdiction to review a state court's resolution of an issue of federal law if the state court's decision
rests on an adequate and independent state ground, see Herb
v. Pitcairn, 324 U. S. 117, 125-126 (1945), as it will if the
state court's opinion "indicates clearly and expressly" that
the state ground is an alternative holding, see Michigan v.
Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1041 (1983); see also Harris v. Reed,
489 U. S. 255, 264, n. 10 (1989); Fox Film Corp. v. Muller, 296
U. S. 207, 210 (1935).

534 SOCHOR v. FLORIDA

Opinion of the Court
The Supreme Court of Florida said this about petitioner's
claim that the trial judge's instruction on the heinousness
factor was unconstitutional:

"Sochor's next claim, regarding alleged errors in the
penalty jury instructions, likewise must fail. None of
the complained-of jury instructions were objected to
at trial, and, thus, they are not preserved for appeal.
Vaught v. State, 410 So. 2d 147 (Fla. 1982). In any
event, Sochor's claims here have no merit.10

"10. . . . . We reject without discussion Sochor's . . . claims . . . that
the instructions as to the aggravating factors of heinous, atrocious,
or cruel and cold, calculated, and premeditated were improper . . . ."

580 So. 2d, at 602-603, and n. 10.

The quoted passage indicates with requisite clarity that the
rejection of Sochor's claim was based on the alternative state
ground that the claim was "not preserved for appeal," and
Sochor has said nothing in this Court to persuade us that
this state ground is either not adequate or not independent.
Hence, we hold ourselves to be without authority to address
Sochor's claim based on the jury instruction about the heinousness factor.*

*Justice Stevens's dissenting conclusion that we do have jurisdiction,
post, at 547-549, is mistaken. First, the suggestion that Sochor's pretrial
motion objecting to the vagueness of Florida's heinousness factor preserved his objection to the heinousness instruction to the jury, post, at
547, ignores the settled rule of Florida procedure that, in order to preserve
an objection, a party must object after the trial judge has instructed the
jury. See, e. g., Harris v. State, 438 So. 2d 787, 795 (Fla. 1983), cert. denied, 466 U. S. 963 (1984); Vazquez v. State, 518 So. 2d 1348, 1350 (Fla. App.
1987); Walker v. State, 473 So. 2d 694, 697-698 (Fla. App. 1985). While
the rule is subject to a limited exception for an advance request for a
specific jury instruction that is explicitly denied, see, e. g., State v. Heathcoat, 442 So. 2d 955, 957 (Fla. 1983); Buford v. Wainwright, 428 So. 2d

Opinion of the Court

B
Sochor maintains that the same Eighth Amendment viola-tion occurred again when the trial judge, who both parties

1389, 1390 (Fla.), cert. denied, 464 U. S. 956 (1983); De Parias v. State, 562
So. 2d 434, 435 (Fla. App. 1990), Sochor gets no benefit from this exception,
because he never asked for a specific instruction.

Second, Justice Stevens states that "the Florida Supreme Court, far
from providing us with a plain statement that petitioner's claim was procedurally barred, has merely said that the claim was not preserved for appeal, and has given even further indication that petitioner's claim was not
procedurally barred by proceeding to the merits, albeit in the alternative."
Post, at 547-548 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). It is
difficult to comprehend why the State Supreme Court's statement that
"the claim was not preserved for appeal" would not amount to "a plain
statement that petitioner's claim was procedurally barred," especially
since there is no reason to believe that error of the kind Sochor alleged
cannot be waived under Florida law, see this note, infra. It is even more
difficult to comprehend why the fact that the State Supreme Court rested
upon this state ground merely in the alternative would somehow save our
jurisdiction. See supra, at 533.

Third, Justice Stevens suggests that, in holding Sochor's claim
waived, the Supreme Court of Florida implied that the claim did not implicate "fundamental error," and that this in turn implied a rejection of Sochor's claim of "error," presumably because all federal constitutional error
(or at least the kind claimed by Sochor) would automatically be "fundamental." Post, at 548-549. To say that this is "the most reasonable explanation," Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1041 (1983), of the court's summary statement that Sochor's claim was "not preserved for appeal," see
580 So. 2d, at 602-603, is an Olympic stretch, see Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S.
255, 274-276 (1989) (Kennedy, J., dissenting). In any event, we know of
no Florida authority supporting Justice Stevens's suggestion that all
federal constitutional error (or even the kind claimed by Sochor) would be
automatically "fundamental." Indeed, where, as here, valid aggravating
factors would remain, instructional error involving another factor is not
"fundamental." See Occhicone v. State, 570 So. 2d 902, 906 (Fla. 1990),
cert. denied, 500 U. S. 938 (1991).

Finally, Justice Stevens's suggestion that the State waived its
independent-state-ground defense, post, at 548-549, forgets that this defense goes to our jurisdiction and therefore cannot be waived. See supra,
at 533.

guidance. Ibid. Sochor nonetheless argues that Walton isno help to the State, because Florida's heinousness factor has
not been subjected to the limitation of a narrow constructionfrom the State Supreme Court.

In State v. Dixon, 283 So. 2d 1 (1973), cert. denied, 416
U. S. 943 (1974), the Supreme Court of Florida construed thestatutory definition of the heinousness factor:

"It is our interpretation that heinous means extremely
wicked or shockingly evil; that atrocious means outrageously wicked and vile; and, that cruel means designed toinflict a high degree of pain with utter indifference to,

or even enjoyment of, the suffering of others. What isintended to be included are those capital crimes where
the actual commission of the capital felony was accompa-nied by such additional acts as to set the crime apart
from the norm of capital felonies--the conscienceless orpitiless crime which is unnecessarily torturous to the
victim." 283 So. 2d, at 9.
Understanding the factor, as defined in Dixon, to apply only
to a "conscienceless or pitiless crime which is unnecessarily
torturous to the victim," we held in Proffitt v. Florida, 428
U. S. 242 (1976), that the sentencer had adequate guidance.
See id., at 255-256 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).

Sochor contends, however, that the State Supreme Court's
post-Proffitt cases have not adhered to Dixon's limitation as

Opinion of the Court
stated in Proffitt, but instead evince inconsistent and overbroad constructions that leave a trial court without sufficient
guidance. And we may well agree with him that the Supreme Court of Florida has not confined its discussions on
the matter to the Dixon language we approved in Proffitt,
but has on occasion continued to invoke the entire Dixon
statement quoted above, perhaps thinking that Proffitt approved it all. See, e. g., Porter v. State, 564 So. 2d 1060
(1990), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 1110 (1991); Cherry v. State,
544 So. 2d 184, 187 (1989), cert. denied, 494 U. S. 1090 (1990);
Lucas v. State, 376 So. 2d 1149, 1153 (1979).

But however much that may be troubling in the abstract,
it need not trouble us here, for our review of Florida law
indicates that the State Supreme Court has consistently held
that heinousness is properly found if the defendant strangled
a conscious victim. See Hitchcock v. State, 578 So. 2d 685,
692-693 (1990), cert. denied, 502 U. S. 912 (1991); Holton v.
State, 573 So. 2d 284, 292 (1990); Tompkins v. State, 502
So. 2d 415, 421 (1986); Johnson v. State, 465 So. 2d 499, 507,
cert. denied, 474 U. S. 865 (1985); Adams v. State, 412 So. 2d
850, cert. denied, 459 U. S. 882 (1982). Cf. Rhodes v. State,
547 So. 2d 1201, 1208 (1989) (strangulation of semiconscious
victim not heinous); Herzog v. State, 439 So. 2d 1372 (1983)
(same). We must presume the trial judge to have been familiar with this body of case law, see Walton, 497 U. S., at
653, which, at a minimum, gave the trial judge "[some] guidance," id., at 654. Since the Eighth Amendment requires no
more, we infer no error merely from the fact that the trial
judge weighed the heinousness factor. While Sochor responds that the State Supreme Court's interpretation of the
heinousness factor has left Florida trial judges without sufficient guidance in other factual situations, we fail to see how
that supports the conclusion that the trial judge was without
sufficient guidance in the case at hand. See generally Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S., at 361-364.

538 SOCHOR v. FLORIDA

Opinion of the Court

III
Sochor also claims that when "the sentencer" weighed thecoldness factor there was Eighth Amendment error that

went uncorrected in the State Supreme Court.

A
First, Sochor complains of consideration of the coldnessfactor by the jury, the first step in his argument being that

the coldness factor was "invalid" in that it was unsupportedby the evidence; the second step, that the jury in the instant
case "weighed" the coldness factor; and the third and laststep, that in Florida the jury is at least a constituent part of
"the sentencer" for Clemons purposes. The argument fails,however, for the second step is fatally flawed. Because the
jury in Florida does not reveal the aggravating factors onwhich it relies, we cannot know whether this jury actually
relied on the coldness factor. If it did not, there was noEighth Amendment violation. Thus, Sochor implicitly suggests that, if the jury was allowed to rely on any of two ormore independent grounds, one of which is infirm, we should
presume that the resulting general verdict rested on the in-firm ground and must be set aside. See

Mills v. Maryland,486 U. S. 367, 376-377 (1988); cf. Stromberg v. California,

283 U. S. 359, 368 (1931). Just this Term, however, we heldit was no violation of due process that a trial court instructed
a jury on two different legal theories, one supported by theevidence, the other not. See

Griffin v. United States, 502U. S. 46 (1991). We reasoned that although a jury is unlikely

to disregard a theory flawed in law, it is indeed likely todisregard an option simply unsupported by evidence. Id., at
59-60. We see no occasion for different reasoning here, andaccordingly decline to presume jury error.

B
Sochor next complains that Eighth Amendment error inthe trial judge's weighing of the coldness factor was left uncured by the State Supreme Court.

Opinion of the Court

1
We can start from some points of agreement. The partiesagree that, in Florida, the trial judge is at least a constituent

part of "the sentencer" for Clemons purposes, and there is,of course, no doubt that the trial judge "weighed" the coldness factor, as he said in his sentencing order. Nor is thereany question that the coldness factor was "invalid" for

Clemons purposes, since Parker applied the Clemons rule wherea trial judge had weighed two aggravating circumstances

that were invalid in the sense that the Supreme Court ofFlorida had found them to be unsupported by the evidence.
See 498 U. S., at 311. It follows that Eighth Amendmenterror did occur when the trial judge weighed the coldness
factor in the instant case. What is in issue is the adequacyof the State Supreme Court's effort to cure the error under
the rule announced in Clemons, that a sentence so taintedrequires appellate reweighing or review for harmlessness.

2
We noted in Parker that the Supreme Court of Floridawill generally not reweigh evidence independently, 498 U. S.,

at 319 (citing Hudson v. State, 538 So. 2d 829, 831 (per curiam), cert. denied, 493 U. S. 875 (1989); Brown v. Wainwright, 392 So. 2d 1327, 1331-1332 (1981) (per curiam)), andthe parties agree that, to this extent at least, our perception

of Florida law was correct. The State argues, nonetheless,that, in this case, the State Supreme Court did support the
death verdict adequately by performing harmless-error anal-ysis. It relies on the excerpt from the state court's opinion
quoted above, and particularly on the second through fourthsentences, as "declar[ing] a belief that" the trial judge's
weighing of the coldness factor "was harmless beyond a rea-sonable doubt" in that it "did not contribute to the [sentence]
obtained." Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 24 (1967).This, however, is far from apparent. Not only does the
State Supreme Court's opinion fail so much as to mention

504us2$84J 04-08-96 07:12:57 PAGES OPINPGT
540 SOCHOR v. FLORIDA

Opinion of the Court
"harmless error," see Yates v. Evatt, 500 U. S. 391, 406
(1991), but the quoted sentences numbered one and five expressly refer to the quite different enquiry whether Sochor's
sentence was proportional.

The State tries to counter this deficiency by arguing that
the four cases cited following the fourth sentence of the
quoted passage were harmless-error cases, citation to which
was a shorthand signal that the court had reviewed this record for harmless error as well. But the citations come up
short. Only one of the four cases contains language giving
an explicit indication that the State Supreme Court had performed harmless-error analysis. See Holton v. State, 573
So. 2d 284, 293 (1990) ("We find the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt"). The other three simply do not,
and the result is ambiguity.

Although we do not mean here to require a particular formulaic indication by state courts before their review for
harmless federal error will pass federal scrutiny, a plain
statement that the judgment survives on such an enquiry is
clearly preferable to allusions by citation. In any event,
when the citations stop as far short of clarity as these do,
they cannot even arguably substitute for explicit language
signifying that the State Supreme Court reviewed for harmless error.

IV

In sum, Eighth Amendment error occurred when the trial
judge weighed the coldness factor. Since the Supreme
Court of Florida did not explain or even "declare a belief
that" this error "was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt"
in that "it did not contribute to the [sentence] obtained,"
Chapman, supra, at 24, the error cannot be taken as cured
by the State Supreme Court's consideration of the case. It
follows that Sochor's sentence cannot stand on the existing
record of appellate review. We vacate the judgment of the

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
Supreme Court of Florida and remand the case for proceed-ings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion but write separately to set forth
my understanding that the Court does not hold that an appellate court can fulfill its obligations of meaningful reviewby simply reciting the formula for harmless error. In

Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18 (1967), we held that before afederal constitutional error can be held harmless, the reviewing court must find "beyond a reasonable doubt that theerror complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained." Id., at 24. This is a justifiably high standard, andwhile it can be met without uttering the magic words "harmless error," see ante, at 540, the reverse is not true. An
appellate court's bald assertion that an error of constitutionaldimensions was "harmless" cannot substitute for a principled

explanation of how the court reached that conclusion. In
Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738 (1990), for example, we
did not hesitate to remand a case for "a detailed explanation
based on the record" when the lower court failed to undertake an explicit analysis supporting its "cryptic," onesentence conclusion of harmless error. Id., at 753. I agree
with the Court that the Florida Supreme Court's discussion
of the proportionality of petitioner's sentence is not an acceptable substitute for harmless error analysis, see ante, at
539-540, and I do not understand the Court to say that the
mere addition of the words "harmless error" would have sufficed to satisfy the dictates of Clemons.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice White
and Justice Thomas join, concurring in part and dissenting
in part.

I join in all that the Court has to say in rejecting Sochor's
claim that the application of Florida's "heinousness" factor in

504us2$84J 04-08-96 07:12:58 PAGES OPINPGT
542 SOCHOR v. FLORIDA

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
this case violated his constitutional rights. I also agreewith the majority that Eighth Amendment error occurred

when the trial judge weighed the invalid "coldness" factor inimposing Sochor's death sentence. Accordingly, I join Parts
I, II, III-A, and III-B-1 of the Court's opinion. I dissentfrom Parts III-B-2 and IV of the opinion, however, for I
believe that the Supreme Court of Florida cured this sen-tencing error by finding it harmless. I would thus affirm
the judgment below and uphold the sentence.When a reviewing court invalidates one or more of the
aggravating factors upon which the sentencer relied in im-posing a death sentence, the court may uphold the sentence
by reweighing the remaining evidence or by conductingharmless-error analysis. Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S.
738 (1990). As the majority observes, the Supreme Courtof Florida does not in practice independently reweigh aggravating and mitigating evidence, and it did not do so in thiscase. Ante, at 539-540. In order to sustain Sochor's sentence, the court thus had to find any error harmless. Inother words, it had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that
the trial judge would still have imposed the death sentenceif he had not considered the "coldness" factor when performing the weighing function required by Florida law. Clemons v. Mississippi, supra, at 753; Chapman v. California,386 U. S. 18, 24 (1967). It seems clear to me that the court

reached this conclusion, and that the conclusion is certainlyjustified by the facts of this case.

After finding that the trial judge erred in relying on the"coldness" factor in determining Sochor's sentence, the Supreme Court of Florida stated:

"The trial court carefully weighed the aggravating fac-tors against the lack of any mitigating factors and concluded that death was warranted. Even after removingthe aggravating factor of cold, calculated, and premeditated there still remain three aggravating factors to beweighed against no mitigating circumstances. Striking

543Cite as: 504 U. S. 527 (1992)
Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
one aggravating factor when there are no mitigating cir-cumstances does not necessarily require resentencing.

Robinson v. State, 574 So. 2d 108 (Fla. 1991); Holton v.State, 573 So. 2d 284 (Fla. 1990); James v. State, 453
So. 2d 786 (Fla.), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 1098 . . . (1984);
Francois v. State, 407 So. 2d 885 (Fla. 1981), cert. denied,458 U. S. 1122 . . . (1982)." 580 So. 2d 595, 604 (1991).

The Court now holds that this passage fails to indicate thatthe error in this case was viewed as harmless. It is true
that the passage does not mention the words "harmlesserror." But we have never held that a court must necessarily recite those words in determining whether an error hadan effect on a certain result. In deciding whether the Supreme Court of Florida conducted adequate harmless-erroranalysis in this case, our focus should not be solely on the
particular words and phrases it used to convey its thoughts.Whatever words it used, if they show that it concluded
beyond a reasonable doubt that elimination of the "cold-ness" aggravating factor would have made no difference to
Sochor's sentence, then it conducted adequate harmless-erroranalysis. See

Parker v. Dugger, 498 U. S. 308, 319 (1991).I am convinced by the passage quoted above that the Supreme Court of Florida believed, beyond a reasonable doubt,that the elimination of the "coldness" factor would have
made no difference at all in this case. A review of the ag-gravating and mitigating evidence presented in this case
demonstrates why. In making his sentencing determina-tion, the trial judge found four aggravating circumstances,
including the "coldness" aggravator. He found absolutely nomitigating evidence. After weighing the four aggravating
circumstances against zero mitigating circumstances, thetrial judge imposed the death penalty. The Supreme Court
of Florida later found the "coldness" aggravating circum-stance invalid. It observed, however, that three valid aggravators were left to be balanced against the complete lackof mitigating evidence. On that basis, the court concluded

504us2$84J 04-08-96 07:12:58 PAGES OPINPGT
544 SOCHOR v. FLORIDA

Opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.
that resentencing was unnecessary. After reaching thatconclusion, the court cited four cases in which it had invalidated aggravating factors but had upheld the death sen-tences, having found that the inclusion of those aggravators
made no difference to the weighing process. One of the
cases cited in fact made explicit mention of harmless-erroranalysis.

Holton v. State, 573 So. 2d 284, 293 (1990) ("Under
the circumstances of this case, we cannot say there is anyreasonable likelihood the trial court would have concluded

that the three valid aggravating circumstances were out-weighed by the mitigating factors. We find the error was
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt") (citation omitted).
See supra, at 542-543.

In my mind, it is no stretch to conclude that the court
saw this case for what it is--a paradigmatic example of the
situation where the invalidation of an aggravator makes absolutely no difference in the sentencing calculus. We have
previously observed that the invalidation of an aggravating
circumstance results in the removal of a "thumb . . . from
death's side of the scale." Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S. 222,
232 (1992). Precisely for this reason, we require appellate
courts to either reweigh the evidence or perform harmlesserror analysis if they seek to affirm a death sentence after
invalidating an aggravator. In a case such as this, however,
where there is not so much as a thumbnail on the scale in
favor of mitigation, I would not require appellate courts to
adhere to any particular form of words to demonstrate that
which is evident. If the trial judge in this case had eliminated the "coldness" aggravator from the weighing process,
and had balanced the three valid aggravators against the
complete absence of mitigating evidence, the absent mitigating evidence would still have failed to outweigh the aggravating evidence, and the sentence would still have been
death. Although it did so cursorily, I am convinced that the
Supreme Court of Florida found the inclusion of the invalid
"coldness" factor harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
It seems that the omission of the words "harmless error"
from the opinion below is the root of this Court's dissatisfaction with it. In all likelihood, the Supreme Court of Florida
will reimpose Sochor's death sentence on remand, perhaps by
appending a sentence using the talismanic phrase "harmless
error." Form will then correspond to substance, but this
marginal benefit does not justify our effort to supervise the
opinion writing of state courts. I would therefore affirm the
judgment below.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Blackmun joins,
concurring in part and dissenting in part.

We granted certiorari to consider two questions.1 The
Court answers the first question in Parts III-B and IV of its
opinion, see ante, at 538-540, which I join. I do not, however, agree with the Court's treatment of the plain error that
occurred when the trial judge instructed the jury at the penalty phase of the trial. See ante, at 532-534. Florida argues that this error was harmless because the death sentence was imposed by the judge rather than the jury. The
Court today does not address this argument because it concludes that petitioner waived the error by failing to object
to the instruction. I disagree with this Court in its effort

1 Petitioner included four questions in his petition for writ of certiorari;
however, the Court limited its grant to a consideration of questions two
and four, which petitioner framed as follows:

"2. Did the Florida Supreme Court's review of petitioner's death sentence violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments where that court
upheld the sentence even though the trial court had instructed the jury
on, and had applied, an improper aggravating circumstance, where the
Florida Supreme Court did not reweigh the evidence or conduct a harmless error analysis as to the effect of improper use of the circumstance on
the jury's penalty verdict?"

"4. Did the application of Florida's `especially heinous, atrocious, or
cruel' aggravating circumstance at bar violate the Eighth and Fourteenth
Amendments?" Pet. for Cert. ii.

to avoid the issue and with the Florida Supreme Court in itsappraisal of the error.

I
There is no dispute that the instruction prescribing the so-called heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance

(or heinousness factor, according to the Court's nomencla-ture)

2 was unconstitutionally vague under our decision in

Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356 (1988).3 In Cartwright, the Court explained that "[t]o say that something is`especially heinous' merely suggests that the individual jurors should determine that the murder is more than just `hei-nous,' whatever that means, and an ordinary person could
honestly believe that every unjustified, intentional taking ofhuman life is `especially heinous.' "

Id., at 364 (citation omit-ted). Although a state court may adopt a limiting construction of a vague capital sentencing aggravating circumstanceto give meaningful guidance to the sentencer, see id., at 360,
365; Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 653 (1990); Lewis v.
Jeffers, 497 U. S. 764, 778-779 (1990); Godfrey v. Georgia, 446U. S. 420, 428 (1980) (plurality opinion), or a state appellate

court might apply a limiting definition of the aggravatingcircumstance to the facts presented, see Cartwright, 486
U. S., at 364; Walton, 497 U. S., at 653; Jeffers, 497 U. S., at778-779; Godfrey, 446 U. S., at 429, the Florida Supreme

2 The trial judge gave the following instruction with respect to the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance: "The aggravating circumstances that you may consider are limited to any of the following that
are established by the evidence. . . . [N]umber three, the crime for which
the defendant is to be sentenced was especially wicked, evil, atrocious or
cruel." App. 326-327.

3 See Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 653 (1990) ("It is not enough to

instruct the jury in the bare terms of an aggravating circumstance that is
unconstitutionally vague on its face"); Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420,
428 (1980) ("There is nothing in these few words, [`outrageously or
wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman,'] standing alone, that implies any
inherent restraint on the arbitrary and capricious infliction of the death
sentence").

Court has failed to do so here. In Proffitt v. Florida, 428U. S. 242, 255-256 (1976), this Court approved the limiting

construction adopted by the Florida Supreme Court for theheinousness factor;

4 however, the guidance given in State v.

Dixon, 283 So. 2d 1 (Fla. 1973), was certainly not providedin the bare bones of the instruction given by the trial court

in this case. See n. 2, supra.

II
Petitioner's failure to object to the instruction at trial didnot deprive the Florida Supreme Court or this Court of the

power to correct the obvious constitutional error. First,petitioner did object to the vagueness of this aggravating
circumstance in a Motion To Declare Section 921.141, FloridaStatutes Unconstitutional Re: Aggravating and Mitigating
Circumstances at the start of trial, see App. 8, 10; 5 however,that motion was denied. See 1 Tr. 9. Second, the Florida
Supreme Court, though noting that petitioner had failed tomake a contemporaneous objection to the instruction at the
time of trial, nevertheless went on to reach the merits ofpetitioner's claim. See 580 So. 2d 595, 603 (1991). Thus,
the Florida Supreme Court, far from providing us with aplain statement that petitioner's claim was procedurally
barred, see Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1042 (1983),has merely said that the claim was "not preserved for appeal," 580 So. 2d, at 602, and has given even further indica4 In State v. Dixon, 283 So. 2d 1 (Fla. 1973), cert. denied, 416 U. S. 943
(1974), the Florida courts had construed the heinousness factor to apply
only to "the conscienceless or pitiless crime which is unnecessarily torturous to the victim." 283 So. 2d, at 9.

5 In particular, petitioner alleged:

"Almost any capital felony would appear especially cruel, heinous and atrocious to the layman, particularly any felony murder. Examination of the
widespread application of this circumstance indicates that reasonable and
consistent application is impossible. This standard is vague and overbroad and provides no basis for distinguishing one factual situation from
another. Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420 (1980)." App. 10.

tion that petitioner's claim was not procedurally barred byproceeding to the merits, albeit in the alternative. Third,

and most important, the state court may review a fundamen-tal error despite a party's failure to make a contemporaneous
objection in the trial court,6 and it unquestionably has thepower to review this error even though the error may not
have been properly preserved for appeal.7 As the FloridaSupreme Court explained, "[f]undamental error has been defined as `error which goes to the foundation of the case orgoes to the merits of the cause of action,' " and although it
is to be applied " `very guardedly,' " it nevertheless is to beapplied in those "rare cases where a jurisdictional error appears or where the interests of justice present a compellingdemand for its application."

Ray v. State, 403 So. 2d 956,960 (1981) (citations omitted).

8 Presumably because the

6 See, e. g., Ray v. State, 403 So. 2d 956, 960 (Fla. 1981) ("This Court has
indicated that for error to be so fundamental that it may be urged on
appeal, though not properly presented below, the error must amount to a
denial of due process"); Castor v. State, 365 So. 2d 701, 704, n. 7 (Fla. 1978)
(same); State v. Smith, 240 So. 2d 807, 810 (Fla. 1970) (same).

7 The Florida Supreme Court's statement that none of the alleged errors

in the jury instructions had been "preserved for appeal," 580 So. 2d 595,
602 (1991), merely raised the question whether they should nevertheless
be reviewed under the "fundamental error" exception. That question was
answered by the court's statement that petitioner's claims "have no
merit." Id., at 603.

8 The Court clearly misconstrues my point about fundamental error if it

understands me to be saying that all errors concerning an improper instruction on the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance
"would automatically be `fundamental.' " Ante, at 535, n. Quite simply,
my point is not that such error necessarily constitutes fundamental error,
but rather, that such error can be the subject of fundamental error review.
In other words, the Florida Supreme Court is not without power, even
when the defendant has failed to raise an objection at trial, to consider
whether such error constitutes fundamental error. Although the Florida
Supreme Court may not necessarily find fundamental error in the particular instance, it is, nevertheless, willing and able to consider whether fundamental error has occurred. See, e. g., Walton v. State, 547 So. 2d 622,
625-626 (Fla. 1989) ("Absent fundamental error, failure to object to the

state court reviews for fundamental error, but did not find
such error here, the State did not oppose the petition for
certiorari by arguing procedural default. See Brief in
Opposition 11 (State argued heinousness factor was not
unconstitutionally vague). Under these circumstances, the
State has waived any possible procedural objection to our
consideration of the erroneous jury instruction,9 and this
Court, contrary to its protestation, is not "without authority"
to address petitioner's claim. Ante, at 534.

III
We should reject unequivocally Florida's submission that
erroneous jury instructions at the penalty phase of a capital
case are harmless because the trial judge is the actual sentencer and the jury's role is purely advisory. That submission is unsound as a matter of law, see, e. g., Riley v. Wainwright, 517 So. 2d 656, 659 (Fla. 1987); Hall v. State, 541
So. 2d 1125, 1129 (Fla. 1989), and as a matter of fact.

deem the defect waived").

Contrary to the Court's suggestion that I have forgotten that the "defense" is jurisdictional, see ante, at 535, n., I believe the Court has forgotten that we have ample power to review a state court's disposition of a
federal question on its merits. If the Florida Supreme Court has jurisdiction to consider petitioner's claim, as I believe it does when it engages in
fundamental error review and reaches the merits of the claim, then this
Court also has jurisdiction to reach the merits.

Florida Supreme Court explained that a jury recommenda-tion of a life sentence can be overturned only if "the facts
suggesting a sentence of death [are] so clear and convincingthat virtually no reasonable person could differ."

Ibid.11Similarly, a jury's recommendation of a death sentence

must also be given great weight.12 For example, in Stonev. State, 378 So. 2d 765, cert. denied, 449 U. S. 986 (1980),
the Florida Supreme Court discussed a challenge to a deathsentence imposed after a jury had recommended a sentence

11 As the Eleventh Circuit observed about the Florida Supreme Court:

"That the court meant what it said in Tedder is amply demonstrated by
the dozens of cases in which it has applied the Tedder standard to reverse

of death. The petitioner had based his challenge on a simi-lar case,

Swan v. State, 322 So. 2d 485 (Fla. 1975), in which
the court had reversed the death sentence. In affirmingStone's sentence, however, the court pointed out that the

critical difference between Stone's case and Swan's case was
that "Swan's jury recommended mercy while Stone's recom-mended death and the jury recommendation is entitled to

great weight. Tedder v. State, 322 So. 2d 908 (Fla. 1975)."378 So. 2d, at 772.

13

As a matter of fact, the jury sentence is the sentence thatis usually imposed by the Florida Supreme Court. The

State has attached an appendix to its brief, see App. to Brieffor Respondent A1-A70, setting forth data concerning 469
capital cases that were reviewed by the Florida SupremeCourt between 1980 and 1991. In 341 of those cases (73%),
the jury recommended the death penalty; in none of those
cases did the trial judge impose a lesser sentence. In 91
cases (19%), the jury recommended a life sentence; in all but
one of those cases, the trial judge overrode the jury's recommended life sentence and imposed a death sentence. In 69
of those overrides (77%), however, the Florida Supreme
Court vacated the trial judge's sentence and either imposed
a life sentence itself or remanded for a new sentencing
hearing.14

13 The Florida courts have long recognized the integral role that the jury
plays in their capital sentencing scheme. See, e. g., Messer v. State, 330
So. 2d 137, 142 (Fla. 1976) ("[T]he legislative intent that can be gleaned
from Section 921.141 . . . [indicates that the legislature] sought to devise
a scheme of checks and balances in which the input of the jury serves as
an integral part"); see also Riley v. Wainwright, 517 So. 2d 656, 657 (Fla.
1988) ("This Court has long held that a Florida capital sentencing jury's
recommendation is an integral part of the death sentencing process"); Lamadline v. State, 303 So. 2d 17, 20 (Fla. 1974) (right to sentencing jury is
"an essential right of the defendant under our death penalty legislation").

14 In 37 out of the 469 cases, there was no jury recommendation either

because the defendant had waived the right to a jury trial or had offered
a plea, or because the jury selection or trial had to be redone.

552 SOCHOR v. FLORIDA

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Two conclusions are evident. First, when the jury recom-mends a death sentence, the trial judge will almost certainly

impose that sentence. Second, when the jury recommendsa life sentence, although overrides have been sustained occasionally, the Florida Supreme Court will normally uphold thejury rather than the judge. It is therefore clear that in
practice, erroneous instructions to the jury at the sentencingphase of the trial may make the difference between life or
death.When a jury has been mistakenly instructed on the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance, the Flor-ida Supreme Court, acknowledging the important role that
the jury plays in the sentencing scheme, has held that theerror was reversible. For example, in Jones v. State, 569
So. 2d 1234 (1990), in which the jury was instructed on theheinousness factor, but the body had been sexually abused
after death, and the death had occurred quickly as the resultof a gunshot wound, the Florida Supreme Court concluded
that the heinousness factor was inapplicable and that its in-clusion in the instructions constituted reversible error. Similarly, in Omelus v. State, 584 So. 2d 563 (1991), when the trialcourt had instructed the jury on the heinousness factor even
though the defendant had contracted with a third party toperform the killing, and had no knowledge of how the murder
was accomplished, the Florida Supreme Court remanded thecase for resentencing. Thus, the Florida Supreme Court
recognized that when the jury's deliberative process is in-fected by consideration of an inapplicable aggravating factor,
the sentence must be vacated unless the error is harmlessbeyond a reasonable doubt.

15 Similarly, the court has recog15 As the Eleventh Circuit observed:
"[T]he Florida Supreme Court will vacate the [death] sentence and order
resentencing before a new jury if it concludes that the proceedings before
the original jury were tainted by error. . . . In those cases, the supreme
court frequently focuses on how the error may have affected the jury's
recommendation. . . . Such a focus would be illogical unless the supreme

Opinion of Scalia, J.
nized that when the jury is given an instruction that is un-constitutionally vague, the jury's deliberative process is also

tainted,16 and a remand is appropriate so that the jury canreach a sentence that is not influenced by the unconstitutional factor unless the error is harmless beyond a reason-able doubt.

The harmless-error inquiry to be conducted by the FloridaSupreme Court on remand should, therefore, encompass the
erroneous jury instruction on the heinousness factor and theerror in submitting an instruction on the cold, calculated, and
premeditated aggravating circumstance to the jury when theevidence did not support such an instruction, as well as the
error committed by the trial judge in relying on that factor.For the reasons given above, I concur in Parts I, III-B,
and IV, and respectfully disagree with Parts II-A, II-B,and III-A.

Justice Scalia, concurring in part and dissenting in part.
I join the Court's opinion insofar as it rejects petitioner'schallenge to the heinous, atrocious, and cruel aggravating

factor. I dissent, however, from its holding that the deathsentence in this case is unconstitutional because the Florida
Supreme Court failed to find "harmless error" after havinginvalidated the trial judge's "coldness" finding.

Even without that finding, three unquestionably valid ag-gravating factors remained, so that the death sentence comcourt began with the premise that the jury's recommendation must be
given significant weight by the trial judge. Once that premise is established, a focus on how the error may have affected the jury's recommendation makes sense: if the jury's recommendation is tainted, then the trial
court's sentencing decision, which took into account that recommendation,
is also tainted." Mann v. Dugger, 844 F. 2d, at 1452-1453 (footnote
omitted).

16 As the court explained in Riley v. Wainwright, 517 So. 2d, at 659: "If

the jury's recommendation, upon which the judge must rely, results from
an unconstitutional procedure, then the entire sentencing process necessarily is tainted by that procedure."

plied with the so-called "narrowing" requirement imposedby the line of cases commencing with Furman v. Georgia,

408 U. S. 238 (1972). The constitutional "error" whoseharmlessness is at issue, then, concerns only the inclusion of
the "coldness" factor in the weighing of the aggravating fac-tors against the mitigating evidence petitioner offered. It
has been my view that the Eighth Amendment does not re-quire any consideration of mitigating evidence, see

Waltonv. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 656 (1990) (opinion concurring in

part and concurring in judgment)--a view I am increasinglyconfirmed in, as the byzantine complexity of the death penalty jurisprudence we are annually accreting becomes moreand more apparent. Since the weighing here was in my
view not constitutionally required, any error in the doing ofit raised no federal question. For that reason, I would affirm the death sentence.

555OCTOBER TERM, 1991

LUJAN, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR v.

DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 90-1424. Argued December 3, 1991--Decided June 12, 1992
Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 divides responsibilities regarding the protection of endangered species between petitioner
Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce, and requires
each federal agency to consult with the relevant Secretary to ensure
that any action funded by the agency is not likely to jeopardize the
continued existence or habitat of any endangered or threatened species.
Both Secretaries initially promulgated a joint regulation extending

$ 7(a)(2)'s coverage to actions taken in foreign nations, but a subsequent
joint rule limited the section's geographic scope to the United States
and the high seas. Respondents, wildlife conservation and other environmental organizations, filed an action in the District Court, seeking
a declaratory judgment that the new regulation erred as to $ 7(a)(2)'s
geographic scope and an injunction requiring the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate a new rule restoring his initial interpretation. The
Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's dismissal of the suit for
lack of standing. Upon remand, on cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court denied the Secretary's motion, which renewed
his objection to standing, and granted respondents' motion, ordering the
Secretary to publish a new rule. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
911 F. 2d 117, reversed and remanded.

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part
III-B, concluding that respondents lack standing to seek judicial review
of the rule. Pp. 559-567, 571-578.

(a) As the parties invoking federal jurisdiction, respondents bear the
burden of showing standing by establishing, inter alia, that they have
suffered an injury in fact, i. e., a concrete and particularized, actual or
imminent invasion of a legally protected interest. To survive a summary judgment motion, they must set forth by affidavit or other evidence specific facts to support their claim. Standing is particularly difficult to show here, since third parties, rather than respondents, are
the object of the Government action or inaction to which respondents
object. Pp. 559-562.

556 LUJAN v. DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE

Syllabus
(b) Respondents did not demonstrate that they suffered an injury in
fact. Assuming that they established that funded activities abroad
threaten certain species, they failed to show that one or more of their
members would thereby be directly affected apart from the members'
special interest in the subject. See Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S.
727, 735, 739. Affidavits of members claiming an intent to revisit project sites at some indefinite future time, at which time they will presumably be denied the opportunity to observe endangered animals, do not
suffice, for they do not demonstrate an "imminent" injury. Respondents also mistakenly rely on a number of other novel standing theories.
Their theory that any person using any part of a contiguous ecosystem
adversely affected by a funded activity has standing even if the activity
is located far away from the area of their use is inconsistent with this
Court's opinion in Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U. S. 871.
And they state purely speculative, nonconcrete injuries when they
argue that suit can be brought by anyone with an interest in studying
or seeing endangered animals anywhere on the globe and anyone with
a professional interest in such animals. Pp. 562-567.

(c) The Court of Appeals erred in holding that respondents had standing on the ground that the statute's citizen-suit provision confers on all
persons the right to file suit to challenge the Secretary's failure to follow
the proper consultative procedure, notwithstanding their inability to allege any separate concrete injury flowing from that failure. This Court
has consistently held that a plaintiff claiming only a generally available
grievance about government, unconnected with a threatened concrete
interest of his own, does not state an Article III case or controversy.
See, e. g., Fairchild v. Hughes, 258 U. S. 126, 129-130. Vindicating the
public interest is the function of the Congress and the Chief Executive.
To allow that interest to be converted into an individual right by a
statute denominating it as such and permitting all citizens to sue, regardless of whether they suffered any concrete injury, would authorize
Congress to transfer from the President to the courts the Chief Executive's most important constitutional duty, to "take Care that the Laws
be faithfully executed," Art. II, $ 3. Pp. 571-578.

558 LUJAN v. DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE

Opinion of the Court
Species Act of 1973 (ESA), 87 Stat. 892, as amended, 16U. S. C. $ 1536, in such fashion as to render it applicable only

to actions within the United States or on the high seas. Thepreliminary issue, and the only one we reach, is whether
respondents here, plaintiffs below, have standing to seekjudicial review of the rule.

I
The ESA, 87 Stat. 884, as amended, 16 U. S. C. $ 1531 etseq., seeks to protect species of animals against threats to

their continuing existence caused by man. See generallyTVA v. Hill, 437 U. S. 153 (1978). The ESA instructs the
Secretary of the Interior to promulgate by regulation a listof those species which are either endangered or threatened
under enumerated criteria, and to define the critical habitatof these species. 16 U. S. C. $$ 1533, 1536. Section 7(a)(2)
of the Act then provides, in pertinent part:

"Each Federal agency shall, in consultation with andwith the assistance of the Secretary [of the Interior],

insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried outby such agency . . . is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatenedspecies or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined bythe Secretary, after consultation as appropriate with
affected States, to be critical." 16 U. S. C. $ 1536(a)(2).
In 1978, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the Na-tional Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), on behalf of the

Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commercerespectively, promulgated a joint regulation stating that the
obligations imposed by $ 7(a)(2) extend to actions taken inforeign nations. 43 Fed. Reg. 874 (1978). The next year,
however, the Interior Department began to reexamine itsposition. Letter from Leo Kuliz, Solicitor, Department of
the Interior, to Assistant Secretary, Fish and Wildlife andParks, Aug. 8, 1979. A revised joint regulation, reinterpret504US2$85K 02-20-99 18:37:19 PAGES OPINPGT

ing $ 7(a)(2) to require consultation only for actions taken inthe United States or on the high seas, was proposed in 1983,

48 Fed. Reg. 29990, and promulgated in 1986, 51 Fed. Reg.19926; 50 CFR 402.01 (1991).

Shortly thereafter, respondents, organizations dedicatedto wildlife conservation and other environmental causes, filed
this action against the Secretary of the Interior, seeking adeclaratory judgment that the new regulation is in error as
to the geographic scope of $ 7(a)(2) and an injunction requir-ing the Secretary to promulgate a new regulation restoring
the initial interpretation. The District Court granted theSecretary's motion to dismiss for lack of standing.

Defenders of Wildlife v. Hodel, 658 F. Supp. 43, 47-48 (Minn. 1987).The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed by a

divided vote. Defenders of Wildlife v. Hodel, 851 F. 2d 1035(1988). On remand, the Secretary moved for summary judgment on the standing issue, and respondents moved for sum-mary judgment on the merits. The District Court denied
the Secretary's motion, on the ground that the Eighth Circuithad already determined the standing question in this case;
it granted respondents' merits motion, and ordered the Sec-retary to publish a revised regulation.

Defenders of Wild-life v. Hodel, 707 F. Supp. 1082 (Minn. 1989). The Eighth

Circuit affirmed. 911 F. 2d 117 (1990). We granted certio-rari, 500 U. S. 915 (1991).

II
While the Constitution of the United States divides allpower conferred upon the Federal Government into "legislative Powers," Art. I, $ 1, "[t]he executive Power," Art. II, $ 1,and "[t]he judicial Power," Art. III, $ 1, it does not attempt
to define those terms. To be sure, it limits the jurisdictionof federal courts to "Cases" and "Controversies," but an executive inquiry can bear the name "case" (the Hoffa case)and a legislative dispute can bear the name "controversy"
(the Smoot-Hawley controversy). Obviously, then, the Con-stitution's central mechanism of separation of powers de504US2 Unit: $U85 [08-11-99 15:08:23] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
pends largely upon common understanding of what activitiesare appropriate to legislatures, to executives, and to courts.

In The Federalist No. 48, Madison expressed the view that"[i]t is not infrequently a question of real nicety in legislative
bodies whether the operation of a particular measure will, orwill not, extend beyond the legislative sphere," whereas "the
executive power [is] restrained within a narrower compassand . . . more simple in its nature," and "the judiciary [is]
described by landmarks still less uncertain." The Federal-ist No. 48, p. 256 (Carey and McClellan eds. 1990). One of
those landmarks, setting apart the "Cases" and "Controver-sies" that are of the justiciable sort referred to in Article
III--"serv[ing] to identify those disputes which are appro-priately resolved through the judicial process," Whitmore v.
Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 155 (1990)--is the doctrine of stand-ing. Though some of its elements express merely prudential
considerations that are part of judicial self-government, thecore component of standing is an essential and unchanging
part of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article III.See,

e. g., Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751 (1984).Over the years, our cases have established that the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains threeelements. First, the plaintiff must have suffered an "injury
in fact"--an invasion of a legally protected interest which is(a) concrete and particularized, see id., at 756; Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 508 (1975); Sierra Club v. Morton, 405U. S. 727, 740-741, n. 16 (1972);

1 and (b) "actual or imminent,

not `conjectural' or `hypothetical,' " Whitmore, supra, at 155(quoting

Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 102 (1983)). Sec-ond, there must be a causal connection between the injury

and the conduct complained of--the injury has to be "fairly. . . trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and
not . . . th[e] result [of] the independent action of some thirdparty not before the court."

Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare

1 By particularized, we mean that the injury must affect the plaintiff in
a personal and individual way.

Opinion of the Court
Rights Organization, 426 U. S. 26, 41-42 (1976). Third, itmust be "likely," as opposed to merely "speculative," that

the injury will be "redressed by a favorable decision." Id.,at 38, 43.

The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden
of establishing these elements. See FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas,493 U. S. 215, 231 (1990);

Warth, supra, at 508. Since they
are not mere pleading requirements but rather an indispen-sable part of the plaintiff 's case, each element must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which theplaintiff bears the burden of proof,

i. e., with the manner and
degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the
litigation. See Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497

supra, at 45, n. 25; Warth, supra, at 527, and n. 6 (Brennan,
J., dissenting). At the pleading stage, general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant's conduct may
suffice, for on a motion to dismiss we "presum[e] that general
allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to
support the claim." National Wildlife Federation, supra,
at 889. In response to a summary judgment motion, however, the plaintiff can no longer rest on such "mere allegations," but must "set forth" by affidavit or other evidence
"specific facts," Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(e), which for purposes
of the summary judgment motion will be taken to be true.
And at the final stage, those facts (if controverted) must be
"supported adequately by the evidence adduced at trial."

When the suit is one challenging the legality of government action or inaction, the nature and extent of facts that
must be averred (at the summary judgment stage) or proved
(at the trial stage) in order to establish standing depends
considerably upon whether the plaintiff is himself an object
of the action (or forgone action) at issue. If he is, there is
ordinarily little question that the action or inaction has

Opinion of the Court
caused him injury, and that a judgment preventing or requir-ing the action will redress it. When, however, as in this

case, a plaintiff 's asserted injury arises from the govern-ment's allegedly unlawful regulation (or lack of regulation) of
someone else, much more is needed. In that circumstance,causation and redressability ordinarily hinge on the response
of the regulated (or regulable) third party to the governmentaction or inaction--and perhaps on the response of others as
well. The existence of one or more of the essential elementsof standing "depends on the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the courts and whose exercise ofbroad and legitimate discretion the courts cannot presume
either to control or to predict," ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish,490 U. S. 605, 615 (1989) (opinion of

Kennedy, J.); see also
Simon, supra, at 41-42; and it becomes the burden of theplaintiff to adduce facts showing that those choices have

been or will be made in such manner as to produce causationand permit redressability of injury. E. g., Warth, supra, at
505. Thus, when the plaintiff is not himself the object of thegovernment action or inaction he challenges, standing is not
precluded, but it is ordinarily "substantially more difficult"to establish.

III
We think the Court of Appeals failed to apply the forego-ing principles in denying the Secretary's motion for summary

judgment. Respondents had not made the requisite demon-stration of (at least) injury and redressability.

A
Respondents' claim to injury is that the lack of consulta-tion with respect to certain funded activities abroad "increas[es] the rate of extinction of endangered and threatenedspecies." Complaint || 5, App. 13. Of course, the desire to
use or observe an animal species, even for purely estheticpurposes, is undeniably a cognizable interest for purpose of

Opinion of the Court
standing. See, e. g., Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S., at 734."But the `injury in fact' test requires more than an injury

to a cognizable interest. It requires that the party seekingreview be himself among the injured."

Id., at 734-735. To
survive the Secretary's summary judgment motion, respondents had to submit affidavits or other evidence showing,through specific facts, not only that listed species were in

fact being threatened by funded activities abroad, but alsothat one or more of respondents' members would thereby be
"directly" affected apart from their " `special interest' in th[e]subject."

Id., at 735, 739. See generally Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333, 343
(1977).

With respect to this aspect of the case, the Court of Appeals focused on the affidavits of two Defenders' members--
Joyce Kelly and Amy Skilbred. Ms. Kelly stated that she
traveled to Egypt in 1986 and "observed the traditional habitat of the endangered nile crocodile there and intend[s] to do
so again, and hope[s] to observe the crocodile directly," and
that she "will suffer harm in fact as the result of [the] American . . . role . . . in overseeing the rehabilitation of the Aswan
High Dam on the Nile . . . and [in] develop[ing] . . . Egypt's
. . . Master Water Plan." App. 101. Ms. Skilbred averred
that she traveled to Sri Lanka in 1981 and "observed th[e]
habitat" of "endangered species such as the Asian elephant
and the leopard" at what is now the site of the Mahaweli
project funded by the Agency for International Development
(AID), although she "was unable to see any of the endangered species"; "this development project," she continued,
"will seriously reduce endangered, threatened, and endemic
species habitat including areas that I visited . . . [, which]
may severely shorten the future of these species"; that
threat, she concluded, harmed her because she "intend[s] to
return to Sri Lanka in the future and hope[s] to be more
fortunate in spotting at least the endangered elephant and
leopard." Id., at 145-146. When Ms. Skilbred was asked

504US2$85K 02-20-99 18:37:19 PAGES OPINPGT
564 LUJAN v. DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE

Opinion of the Court
at a subsequent deposition if and when she had any plans toreturn to Sri Lanka, she reiterated that "I intend to go back

to Sri Lanka," but confessed that she had no current plans:"I don't know [when]. There is a civil war going on right
now. I don't know. Not next year, I will say. In the fu-ture."

Id., at 318.We shall assume for the sake of argument that these affidavits contain facts showing that certain agency-fundedprojects threaten listed species--though that is questionable.
They plainly contain no facts, however, showing how damageto the species will produce "imminent" injury to Mses. Kelly
and Skilbred. That the women "had visited" the areas ofthe projects before the projects commenced proves nothing.
As we have said in a related context, " `Past exposure toillegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or controversy regarding injunctive relief . . . if unaccompanied byany continuing, present adverse effects.' "

Lyons, 461 U. S.,at 102 (quoting O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U. S. 488, 495-496

(1974)). And the affiants' profession of an "inten[t]" to re-turn to the places they had visited before--where they will
presumably, this time, be deprived of the opportunity to ob-serve animals of the endangered species--is simply not
enough. Such "some day" intentions--without any descrip-tion of concrete plans, or indeed even any specification of
when the some day will be--do not support a finding of the"actual or imminent" injury that our cases require. See
supra, at 560.2

2 The dissent acknowledges the settled requirement that the injury complained of be, if not actual, then at least imminent, but it contends that
respondents could get past summary judgment because "a reasonable
finder of fact could conclude . . . that . . . Kelly or Skilbred will soon return
to the project sites." Post, at 591. This analysis suffers either from a
factual or from a legal defect, depending on what the "soon" is supposed
to mean. If "soon" refers to the standard mandated by our precedents--
that the injury be "imminent," Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 155
(1990)--we are at a loss to see how, as a factual matter, the standard
can be met by respondents' mere profession of an intent, some day, to

565Cite as: 504 U. S. 555 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
Besides relying upon the Kelly and Skilbred affidavits, re-spondents propose a series of novel standing theories. The

first, inelegantly styled "ecosystem nexus," proposes thatany person who uses any part of a "contiguous ecosystem"
adversely affected by a funded activity has standing even ifthe activity is located a great distance away. This approach,
as the Court of Appeals correctly observed, is inconsistentwith our opinion in

National Wildlife Federation, whichheld that a plaintiff claiming injury from environmental damreturn. But if, as we suspect, "soon" means nothing more than "in this
lifetime," then the dissent has undertaken quite a departure from our
precedents. Although "imminence" is concededly a somewhat elastic concept, it cannot be stretched beyond its purpose, which is to ensure that
the alleged injury is not too speculative for Article III purposes--that the
injury is " ` "certainly impending," ' " id., at 158 (emphasis added). It has
been stretched beyond the breaking point when, as here, the plaintiff alleges only an injury at some indefinite future time, and the acts necessary
to make the injury happen are at least partly within the plaintiff's own
control. In such circumstances we have insisted that the injury proceed
with a high degree of immediacy, so as to reduce the possibility of deciding
a case in which no injury would have occurred at all. See, e. g., id., at
156-160; Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 102-106 (1983).

There is no substance to the dissent's suggestion that imminence is demanded only when the alleged harm depends upon "the affirmative actions
of third parties beyond a plaintiff's control," post, at 592. Our cases mention third-party-caused contingency, naturally enough; but they also mention the plaintiff's failure to show that he will soon expose himself to the
injury, see, e. g., Lyons, supra, at 105-106; O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U. S.
488, 497 (1974); Ashcroft v. Mattis, 431 U. S. 171, 172-173, n. 2 (1977) (per
curiam). And there is certainly no reason in principle to demand evidence that third persons will take the action exposing the plaintiff to
harm, while presuming that the plaintiff himself will do so.

Our insistence upon these established requirements of standing does
not mean that we would, as the dissent contends, "demand . . . detailed
descriptions" of damages, such as a "nightly schedule of attempted activities" from plaintiffs alleging loss of consortium. Post, at 593. That case
and the others posited by the dissent all involve actual harm; the existence of standing is clear, though the precise extent of harm remains to be
determined at trial. Where there is no actual harm, however, its imminence (though not its precise extent) must be established.

Opinion of the Court
age must use the area affected by the challenged activityand not an area roughly "in the vicinity" of it. 497 U. S., at

887-889; see also Sierra Club, 405 U. S., at 735. It makesno difference that the general-purpose section of the ESA
states that the Act was intended in part "to provide a means
whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered species andthreatened species depend may be conserved," 16 U. S. C.

$ 1531(b). To say that the Act protects ecosystems is not tosay that the Act creates (if it were possible) rights of action
in persons who have not been injured in fact, that is, personswho use portions of an ecosystem not perceptibly affected by
the unlawful action in question.

Respondents' other theories are called, alas, the "animal
nexus" approach, whereby anyone who has an interest in
studying or seeing the endangered animals anywhere on the
globe has standing; and the "vocational nexus" approach,
under which anyone with a professional interest in such animals can sue. Under these theories, anyone who goes to see
Asian elephants in the Bronx Zoo, and anyone who is a
keeper of Asian elephants in the Bronx Zoo, has standing
to sue because the Director of the Agency for International
Development (AID) did not consult with the Secretary regarding the AID-funded project in Sri Lanka. This is beyond all reason. Standing is not "an ingenious academic
exercise in the conceivable," United States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP), 412 U. S.
669, 688 (1973), but as we have said requires, at the summary
judgment stage, a factual showing of perceptible harm. It
is clear that the person who observes or works with a particular animal threatened by a federal decision is facing perceptible harm, since the very subject of his interest will no
longer exist. It is even plausible--though it goes to the outermost limit of plausibility--to think that a person who observes or works with animals of a particular species in the
very area of the world where that species is threatened by a
federal decision is facing such harm, since some animals that

567Cite as: 504 U. S. 555 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
might have been the subject of his interest will no longer
exist, see Japan Whaling Assn. v. American Cetacean Society, 478 U. S. 221, 231, n. 4 (1986). It goes beyond the limit,
however, and into pure speculation and fantasy, to say that
anyone who observes or works with an endangered species,
anywhere in the world, is appreciably harmed by a single
project affecting some portion of that species with which he
has no more specific connection.3

3 The dissent embraces each of respondents' "nexus" theories, rejecting
this portion of our analysis because it is "unable to see how the distant
location of the destruction necessarily (for purposes of ruling at summary
judgment) mitigates the harm" to the plaintiff. Post, at 594-595. But
summary judgment must be entered "against a party who fails to make a
showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that
party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at
trial." Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U. S. 317, 322 (1986). Respondents
had to adduce facts, therefore, on the basis of which it could reasonably
be found that concrete injury to their members was, as our cases require,
"certainly impending." The dissent may be correct that the geographic
remoteness of those members (here in the United States) from Sri Lanka
and Aswan does not "necessarily" prevent such a finding--but it assuredly
does so when no further facts have been brought forward (and respondents
have produced none) showing that the impact upon animals in those distant places will in some fashion be reflected here. The dissent's position
to the contrary reduces to the notion that distance never prevents harm,
a proposition we categorically reject. It cannot be that a person with an
interest in an animal automatically has standing to enjoin federal threats
to that species of animal, anywhere in the world. Were that the case, the
plaintiff in Sierra Club, for example, could have avoided the necessity of
establishing anyone's use of Mineral King by merely identifying one of its
members interested in an endangered species of flora or fauna at that
location. Justice Blackmun's accusation that a special rule is being
crafted for "environmental claims," post, at 595, is correct, but he is the
craftsman.

Justice Stevens, by contrast, would allow standing on an apparent
"animal nexus" theory to all plaintiffs whose interest in the animals is
"genuine." Such plaintiffs, we are told, do not have to visit the animals
because the animals are analogous to family members. Post, at 583-584,
and n. 2. We decline to join Justice Stevens in this Linnaean leap. It
is unclear to us what constitutes a "genuine" interest; how it differs from

Opinion of Scalia, J.

B
Besides failing to show injury, respondents failed to demonstrate redressability. Instead of attacking the separatedecisions to fund particular projects allegedly causing them

harm, respondents chose to challenge a more generalizedlevel of Government action (rules regarding consultation),
the invalidation of which would affect all overseas projects.This programmatic approach has obvious practical advantages, but also obvious difficulties insofar as proof of causa-tion or redressability is concerned. As we have said in another context, "suits challenging, not specifically identifiable
Government violations of law, but the particular programsagencies establish to carry out their legal obligations . . .

[are], even when premised on allegations of several instancesof violations of law, . . . rarely if ever appropriate for federalcourt adjudication." Allen, 468 U. S., at 759-760.The most obvious problem in the present case is redressability. Since the agencies funding the projects were not
parties to the case, the District Court could accord reliefonly against the Secretary: He could be ordered to revise his

regulation to require consultation for foreign projects. But
this would not remedy respondents' alleged injury unless the
funding agencies were bound by the Secretary's regulation,
which is very much an open question. Whereas in other
contexts the ESA is quite explicit as to the Secretary's
controlling authority, see, e. g., 16 U. S. C. $ 1533(a)(1) ("The
Secretary shall" promulgate regulations determining endangered species); $ 1535(d)(1) ("The Secretary is authorized
to provide financial assistance to any State"), with respect
to consultation the initiative, and hence arguably the initial
responsibility for determining statutory necessity, lies with

a "nongenuine" interest (which nonetheless prompted a plaintiff to file
suit); and why such an interest in animals should be different from such
an interest in anything else that is the subject of a lawsuit.

the agencies, see $ 1536(a)(2) ("Each Federal agency shall, inconsultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary,

insure that any" funded action is not likely to jeopardizeendangered or threatened species) (emphasis added). When
the Secretary promulgated the regulation at issue here, hethought it was binding on the agencies, see 51 Fed. Reg.
19928 (1986). The Solicitor General, however, has repudi-ated that position here, and the agencies themselves apparently deny the Secretary's authority. (During the periodwhen the Secretary took the view that $ 7(a)(2) did apply
abroad, AID and FWS engaged in a running controversyover whether consultation was required with respect to the
Mahaweli project, AID insisting that consultation appliedonly to domestic actions.)

Respondents assert that this legal uncertainty did not af-fect redressability (and hence standing) because the District
Court itself could resolve the issue of the Secretary's author-ity as a necessary part of its standing inquiry. Assuming
that it is appropriate to resolve an issue of law such as thisin connection with a threshold standing inquiry, resolution
by the District Court would not have remedied respond-ents' alleged injury anyway, because it would not have been
binding upon the agencies. They were not parties to thesuit, and there is no reason they should be obliged to honor
an incidental legal determination the suit produced.4 The

4 We need not linger over the dissent's facially impracticable suggestion,
post, at 595-596, that one agency of the Government can acquire the power
to direct other agencies by simply claiming that power in its own regulations
and in litigation to which the other agencies are not parties. As for the
contention that the other agencies will be "collaterally estopped" to challenge our judgment that they are bound by the Secretary of the Interior's
views, because of their participation in this suit, post, at 596-597: Whether
or not that is true now, it was assuredly not true when this suit was
filed, naming the Secretary alone. "The existence of federal jurisdiction
ordinarily depends on the facts as they exist when the complaint is filed."

Court of Appeals tried to finesse this problem by simply proclaiming that "[w]e are satisfied that an injunction requiring
the Secretary to publish [respondents' desired] regulatio[n]
. . . would result in consultation." Defenders of Wildlife,
851 F. 2d, at 1042, 1043-1044. We do not know what would
justify that confidence, particularly when the Justice Department (presumably after consultation with the agencies) has
taken the position that the regulation is not binding.5 The

sis added). It cannot be that, by later participating in the suit, the State
Department and AID retroactively created a redressability (and hence a
jurisdiction) that did not exist at the outset.

The dissent's rejoinder that redressability was clear at the outset because the Secretary thought the regulation binding on the agencies, post,
at 598-599, n. 4, continues to miss the point: The agencies did not agree
with the Secretary, nor would they be bound by a district court holding
(as to this issue) in the Secretary's favor. There is no support for the
dissent's novel contention, ibid., that Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, governing joinder of indispensable parties, somehow alters our
longstanding rule that jurisdiction is to be assessed under the facts existing when the complaint is filed. The redressability element of the Article
III standing requirement and the "complete relief" referred to by Rule 19
are not identical. Finally, we reach the dissent's contention, post, at 599,
n. 4, that by refusing to waive our settled rule for purposes of this case
we have made "federal subject-matter jurisdiction . . . a one-way street
running the Executive Branch's way." That is so, we are told, because
the Executive can dispel jurisdiction where it previously existed (by either
conceding the merits or by pointing out that nonparty agencies would
not be bound by a ruling), whereas a plaintiff cannot retroactively create
jurisdiction based on postcomplaint litigation conduct. But any defendant, not just the Government, can dispel jurisdiction by conceding the
merits (and presumably thereby suffering a judgment) or by demonstrating standing defects. And permitting a defendant to point out a preexisting standing defect late in the day is not remotely comparable to
permitting a plaintiff to establish standing on the basis of the defendant's
litigation conduct occurring after standing is erroneously determined.

5 Seizing on the fortuity that the case has made its way to this Court,

Justice Stevens protests that no agency would ignore "an authoritative
construction of the [ESA] by this Court." Post, at 585. In that he is
probably correct; in concluding from it that plaintiffs have demonstrated
redressability, he is not. Since, as we have pointed out above, standing

Opinion of the Court
short of the matter is that redress of the only injury in factrespondents complain of requires action (termination of funding until consultation) by the individual funding agencies;and any relief the District Court could have provided in this
suit against the Secretary was not likely to produce thataction.

A further impediment to redressability is the fact that theagencies generally supply only a fraction of the funding for
a foreign project. AID, for example, has provided less than10% of the funding for the Mahaweli project. Respondents
have produced nothing to indicate that the projects theyhave named will either be suspended, or do less harm to
listed species, if that fraction is eliminated. As in Simon,426 U. S., at 43-44, it is entirely conjectural whether the nonagency activity that affects respondents will be altered oraffected by the agency activity they seek to achieve.

6 There

is no standing.

IV

The Court of Appeals found that respondents had standing
for an additional reason: because they had suffered a "proce-dural injury." The so-called "citizen-suit" provision of the

ESA provides, in pertinent part, that "any person may comis to be determined as of the commencement of suit; since at that point it
could certainly not be known that the suit would reach this Court; and
since it is not likely that an agency would feel compelled to accede to the
legal view of a district court expressed in a case to which it was not a
party; redressability clearly did not exist.

6 The dissent criticizes us for "overlook[ing]" memoranda indicating that

the Sri Lankan Government solicited and required AID's assistance to
mitigate the effects of the Mahaweli project on endangered species, and
that the Bureau of Reclamation was advising the Aswan project. Post,
at 600-601. The memoranda, however, contain no indication whatever
that the projects will cease or be less harmful to listed species in the
absence of AID funding. In fact, the Sri Lanka memorandum suggests
just the opposite: It states that AID's role will be to mitigate the " `negative impacts to the wildlife,' " post, at 600, which means that the termination of AID funding would exacerbate respondents' claimed injury.

mence a civil suit on his own behalf (A) to enjoin any person,including the United States and any other governmental instrumentality or agency . . . who is alleged to be in violationof any provision of this chapter." 16 U. S. C. $ 1540(g). The
court held that, because $ 7(a)(2) requires interagency con-sultation, the citizen-suit provision creates a "procedural
righ[t]" to consultation in all "persons"--so that anyone canfile suit in federal court to challenge the Secretary's (or presumably any other official's) failure to follow the assertedlycorrect consultative procedure, notwithstanding his or her
inability to allege any discrete injury flowing from that fail-ure. 911 F. 2d, at 121-122. To understand the remarkable
nature of this holding one must be clear about what it doesnot rest upon: This is not a case where plaintiffs are seeking
to enforce a procedural requirement the disregard of whichcould impair a separate concrete interest of theirs (e. g., the
procedural requirement for a hearing prior to denial of theirlicense application, or the procedural requirement for an environmental impact statement before a federal facility is con-structed next door to them).

7 Nor is it simply a case where

concrete injury has been suffered by many persons, as inmass fraud or mass tort situations. Nor, finally, is it the

7 There is this much truth to the assertion that "procedural rights" are
special: The person who has been accorded a procedural right to protect
his concrete interests can assert that right without meeting all the normal
standards for redressability and immediacy. Thus, under our case law,
one living adjacent to the site for proposed construction of a federally
licensed dam has standing to challenge the licensing agency's failure to
prepare an environmental impact statement, even though he cannot establish with any certainty that the statement will cause the license to be
withheld or altered, and even though the dam will not be completed for
many years. (That is why we do not rely, in the present case, upon the
Government's argument that, even if the other agencies were obliged to
consult with the Secretary, they might not have followed his advice.)
What respondents' "procedural rights" argument seeks, however, is quite
different from this: standing for persons who have no concrete interests
affected--persons who live (and propose to live) at the other end of the
country from the dam.

unusual case in which Congress has created a concrete private interest in the outcome of a suit against a private party
for the Government's benefit, by providing a cash bounty
for the victorious plaintiff. Rather, the court held that
the injury-in-fact requirement had been satisfied by congressional conferral upon all persons of an abstract, selfcontained, noninstrumental "right" to have the Executive observe the procedures required by law. We reject this view.8

We have consistently held that a plaintiff raising only a
generally available grievance about government--claiming
only harm to his and every citizen's interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that

8 The dissent's discussion of this aspect of the case, post, at 601-606,
distorts our opinion. We do not hold that an individual cannot enforce
procedural rights; he assuredly can, so long as the procedures in question
are designed to protect some threatened concrete interest of his that is
the ultimate basis of his standing. The dissent, however, asserts that
there exist "classes of procedural duties . . . so enmeshed with the prevention of a substantive, concrete harm that an individual plaintiff may be
able to demonstrate a sufficient likelihood of injury just through the breach
of that procedural duty." Post, at 605. If we understand this correctly,
it means that the Government's violation of a certain (undescribed) class
of procedural duty satisfies the concrete-injury requirement by itself,
without any showing that the procedural violation endangers a concrete
interest of the plaintiff (apart from his interest in having the procedure
observed). We cannot agree. The dissent is unable to cite a single case
in which we actually found standing solely on the basis of a "procedural
right" unconnected to the plaintiff's own concrete harm. Its suggestion
that we did so in Japan Whaling Assn. v. American Cetacean Soc., 478
U. S. 221 (1986), and Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490
U. S. 332 (1989), post, at 602-603, 605, is not supported by the facts. In
the former case, we found that the environmental organizations had standing because the "whale watching and studying of their members w[ould]
be adversely affected by continued whale harvesting," see 478 U. S., at
230-231, n. 4; and in the latter we did not so much as mention standing,
for the very good reason that the plaintiff was a citizens' council for the
area in which the challenged construction was to occur, so that its members would obviously be concretely affected, see Methow Valley Citizens
Council v. Regional Forester, 833 F. 2d 810, 812-813 (CA9 1987).

of the process by which the Nineteenth Amendment was rat-ified. Justice Brandeis wrote for the Court:

"[This is] not a case within the meaning of . . . ArticleIII . . . . Plaintiff has [asserted] only the right, possessed by every citizen, to require that the Governmentbe administered according to law and that the public
moneys be not wasted. Obviously this general rightdoes not entitle a private citizen to institute in the federal courts a suit . . . ." Ibid.
In Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447 (1923), we dis-missed for lack of Article III standing a taxpayer suit challenging the propriety of certain federal expenditures. Wesaid:

"The party who invokes the power [of judicial review]must be able to show not only that the statute is invalid
but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger ofsustaining some direct injury as the result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in some indefiniteway in common with people generally. . . . Here the parties plaintiff have no such case. . . . [T]heir complaint . . .is merely that officials of the executive department of

the government are executing and will execute an act ofCongress asserted to be unconstitutional; and this we
are asked to prevent. To do so would be not to decidea judicial controversy, but to assume a position of authority over the governmental acts of another and co-equal department, an authority which plainly we do not
possess." Id., at 488-489.
In Ex parte Le'vitt, 302 U. S. 633 (1937), we dismissed asuit contending that Justice Black's appointment to this

Court violated the Ineligibility Clause, Art. I, $ 6, cl. 2.

Opinion of the Court
"It is an established principle," we said, "that to entitle aprivate individual to invoke the judicial power to determine

the validity of executive or legislative action he must showthat he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining a direct injury as the result of that action and it is
not sufficient that he has merely a general interest commonto all members of the public." 302 U. S., at 634. See also

Doremus v. Board of Ed. of Hawthorne, 342 U. S. 429, 433-434 (1952) (dismissing taxpayer action on the basis of
Mellon).More recent cases are to the same effect. In

United
States v. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166 (1974), we dismissed for
lack of standing a taxpayer suit challenging the Government's failure to disclose the expenditures of the Central Intelligence Agency, in alleged violation of the constitutional
requirement, Art. I, $ 9, cl. 7, that "a regular Statement and
Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public
Money shall be published from time to time." We held that
such a suit rested upon an impermissible "generalized grievance," and was inconsistent with "the framework of Article
III" because "the impact on [plaintiff] is plainly undifferentiated and `common to all members of the public.' " Richardson, supra, at 171, 176-177. And in Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U. S. 208 (1974), we
dismissed for the same reasons a citizen-taxpayer suit contending that it was a violation of the Incompatibility Clause,
Art. I, $ 6, cl. 2, for Members of Congress to hold commissions in the military Reserves. We said that the challenged
action, "standing alone, would adversely affect only the generalized interest of all citizens in constitutional governance
. . . . We reaffirm Le'vitt in holding that standing to sue
may not be predicated upon an interest of th[is] kind . . . ."
Schlesinger, supra, at 217, 220. Since Schlesinger we have
on two occasions held that an injury amounting only to the
alleged violation of a right to have the Government act in
accordance with law was not judicially cognizable because

576 LUJAN v. DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE

Opinion of the Court
" `assertion of a right to a particular kind of Governmentconduct, which the Government has violated by acting differently, cannot alone satisfy the requirements of Art. III with-out draining those requirements of meaning.' "

Allen, 468
U. S., at 754; Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans
United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S.464, 483 (1982). And only two Terms ago, we rejected the

notion that Article III permits a citizen suit to prevent acondemned criminal's execution on the basis of " `the public
interest protections of the Eighth Amendment' "; once again,"[t]his allegation raise[d] only the `generalized interest of all
citizens in constitutional governance' . . . and [was] an inadequate basis on which to grant . . . standing." Whitmore, 495
U. S., at 160.

To be sure, our generalized-grievance cases have typically
involved Government violation of procedures assertedly ordained by the Constitution rather than the Congress. But
there is absolutely no basis for making the Article III inquiry
turn on the source of the asserted right. Whether the
courts were to act on their own, or at the invitation of Congress, in ignoring the concrete injury requirement described
in our cases, they would be discarding a principle fundamental to the separate and distinct constitutional role of the
Third Branch--one of the essential elements that identifies
those "Cases" and "Controversies" that are the business of
the courts rather than of the political branches. "The province of the court," as Chief Justice Marshall said in Marbury
v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 170 (1803), "is, solely, to decide on
the rights of individuals." Vindicating the public interest
(including the public interest in Government observance
of the Constitution and laws) is the function of Congress
and the Chief Executive. The question presented here is
whether the public interest in proper administration of the
laws (specifically, in agencies' observance of a particular,
statutorily prescribed procedure) can be converted into an
individual right by a statute that denominates it as such, and

Opinion of the Court
that permits all citizens (or, for that matter, a subclass ofcitizens who suffer no distinctive concrete harm) to sue. If

the concrete injury requirement has the separation-of-powers significance we have always said, the answer must be
obvious: To permit Congress to convert the undifferentiatedpublic interest in executive officers' compliance with the law
into an "individual right" vindicable in the courts is to permitCongress to transfer from the President to the courts the
Chief Executive's most important constitutional duty, to"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed," Art. II,

$ 3. It would enable the courts, with the permission of Con-gress, "to assume a position of authority over the governmental acts of another and co-equal department," Massachu-setts v. Mellon, 262 U. S., at 489, and to become " `virtually
continuing monitors of the wisdom and soundness of Execu-tive action.' " Allen, supra, at 760 (quoting Laird v. Tatum,
408 U. S. 1, 15 (1972)). We have always rejected that visionof our role:

"When Congress passes an Act empowering administra-tive agencies to carry on governmental activities, the
power of those agencies is circumscribed by the author-ity granted. This permits the courts to participate in
law enforcement entrusted to administrative bodies onlyto the extent necessary to protect justiciable individual
rights against administrative action fairly beyond thegranted powers. . . . This is very far from assuming that

the courts are charged more than administrators orlegislators with the protection of the rights of the people. Congress and the Executive supervise the acts ofadministrative agents. . . . But under Article III, Congress established courts to adjudicate cases and contro-versies as to claims of infringement of individual rights
whether by unlawful action of private persons or by theexertion of unauthorized administrative power." Stark
v. Wickard, 321 U. S. 288, 309- 310 (1944) (footnoteomitted).

578 LUJAN v. DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE

Opinion of the Court
"Individual rights," within the meaning of this passage,do not mean public rights that have been legislatively

pronounced to belong to each individual who forms partof the public. See also Sierra Club, 405 U. S., at 740-741,
n. 16.Nothing in this contradicts the principle that "[t]he . . .
injury required by Art. III may exist solely by virtue of`statutes creating legal rights, the invasion of which creates
standing.' " Warth, 422 U. S., at 500 (quoting Linda R. S. v.
Richard D., 410 U. S. 614, 617, n. 3 (1973)). Both of the casesused by Linda R. S. as an illustration of that principle involved Congress' elevating to the status of legally cognizableinjuries concrete,

de facto injuries that were previously inad-equate in law (namely, injury to an individual's personal interest in living in a racially integrated community, see Traf-ficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U. S. 205, 208-212
(1972), and injury to a company's interest in marketing itsproduct free from competition, see Hardin v. Kentucky Utilities Co., 390 U. S. 1, 6 (1968)). As we said in Sierra Club,"[Statutory] broadening [of] the categories of injury that
may be alleged in support of standing is a different matterfrom abandoning the requirement that the party seeking review must himself have suffered an injury." 405 U. S., at738. Whether or not the principle set forth in

Warth can beextended beyond that distinction, it is clear that in suits

against the Government, at least, the concrete injury re-quirement must remain.

We hold that respondents lack standing to bring this actionand that the Court of Appeals erred in denying the summary

judgment motion filed by the United States. The opinion ofthe Court of Appeals is hereby reversed, and the cause is
remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Souter joins,
concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

Although I agree with the essential parts of the Court's
analysis, I write separately to make several observations.

I agree with the Court's conclusion in Part III-A that, on
the record before us, respondents have failed to demonstrate
that they themselves are "among the injured." Sierra Club
v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, 735 (1972). This component of the
standing inquiry is not satisfied unless

"[p]laintiffs . . . demonstrate a `personal stake in the outcome.' . . . Abstract injury is not enough. The plaintiff
must show that he `has sustained or is immediately in
danger of sustaining some direct injury' as the result of
the challenged official conduct and the injury or threat
of injury must be both `real and immediate,' not `conjectural' or `hypothetical.' " Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461

U. S. 95, 101-102 (1983) (citations omitted).

While it may seem trivial to require that Mses. Kelly and
Skilbred acquire airline tickets to the project sites or announce a date certain upon which they will return, see ante,
at 564, this is not a case where it is reasonable to assume
that the affiants will be using the sites on a regular basis,
see Sierra Club v. Morton, supra, at 735, n. 8, nor do the
affiants claim to have visited the sites since the projects commenced. With respect to the Court's discussion of respondents' "ecosystem nexus," "animal nexus," and "vocational
nexus" theories, ante, at 565-567, I agree that on this record
respondents' showing is insufficient to establish standing on
any of these bases. I am not willing to foreclose the possibility, however, that in different circumstances a nexus theory similar to those proffered here might support a claim to
standing. See Japan Whaling Assn. v. American Cetacean
Society, 478 U. S. 221, 231, n. 4 (1986) ("[R]espondents . . .
undoubtedly have alleged a sufficient `injury in fact' in that

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
the whale watching and studying of their members will beadversely affected by continued whale harvesting").

In light of the conclusion that respondents have not dem-onstrated a concrete injury here sufficient to support standing under our precedents, I would not reach the issue of redressability that is discussed by the plurality in Part III-B.I also join Part IV of the Court's opinion with the following observations. As Government programs and policies be-come more complex and far reaching, we must be sensitive
to the articulation of new rights of action that do not haveclear analogs in our common-law tradition. Modern litigation has progressed far from the paradigm of Marbury suing
Madison to get his commission, Marbury v. Madison, 1
Cranch 137 (1803), or Ogden seeking an injunction to halt
Gibbons' steamboat operations, Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat.
1 (1824). In my view, Congress has the power to define injuries and articulate chains of causation that will give rise to
a case or controversy where none existed before, and I do
not read the Court's opinion to suggest a contrary view. See
Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 500 (1975); ante, at 578. In
exercising this power, however, Congress must at the very
least identify the injury it seeks to vindicate and relate the
injury to the class of persons entitled to bring suit. The
citizen-suit provision of the Endangered Species Act does not
meet these minimal requirements, because while the statute
purports to confer a right on "any person . . . to enjoin . . .
the United States and any other governmental instrumentality or agency . . . who is alleged to be in violation of any
provision of this chapter," it does not of its own force establish that there is an injury in "any person" by virtue of any
"violation." 16 U. S. C. $ 1540(g)(1)(A).

The Court's holding that there is an outer limit to the
power of Congress to confer rights of action is a direct and
necessary consequence of the case and controversy limitations found in Article III. I agree that it would exceed
those limitations if, at the behest of Congress and in the ab504US2$85L 02-20-99 18:37:19 PAGES OPINPGT

581Cite as: 504 U. S. 555 (1992)
Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
sence of any showing of concrete injury, we were to entertaincitizen suits to vindicate the public's nonconcrete interest in

the proper administration of the laws. While it does notmatter how many persons have been injured by the challenged action, the party bringing suit must show that the
action injures him in a concrete and personal way. This re-quirement is not just an empty formality. It preserves the

vitality of the adversarial process by assuring both that theparties before the court have an actual, as opposed to professed, stake in the outcome, and that "the legal questionspresented . . . will be resolved, not in the rarified atmosphere
of a debating society, but in a concrete factual context con-ducive to a realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial action." Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans
United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S.
464, 472 (1982). In addition, the requirement of concrete injury confines the Judicial Branch to its proper, limited role
in the constitutional framework of Government.

An independent judiciary is held to account through its
open proceedings and its reasoned judgments. In this process it is essential for the public to know what persons or
groups are invoking the judicial power, the reasons that they
have brought suit, and whether their claims are vindicated or
denied. The concrete injury requirement helps assure that
there can be an answer to these questions; and, as the
Court's opinion is careful to show, that is part of the constitutional design.

With these observations, I concur in Parts I, II, III-A, and
IV of the Court's opinion and in the judgment of the Court.

Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment.
Because I am not persuaded that Congress intended the
consultation requirement in $ 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), 16 U. S. C. $ 1536(a)(2), to apply to
activities in foreign countries, I concur in the judgment of
reversal. I do not, however, agree with the Court's conclu504US2$85I 02-20-99 18:37:19 PAGES OPINPGT
582 LUJAN v. DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
sion that respondents lack standing because the threatenedinjury to their interest in protecting the environment and

studying endangered species is not "imminent." Nor do Iagree with the plurality's additional conclusion that respondents' injury is not "redressable" in this litigation.

I
In my opinion a person who has visited the critical habitatof an endangered species has a professional interest in preserving the species and its habitat, and intends to revisitthem in the future has standing to challenge agency action
that threatens their destruction. Congress has found that awide variety of endangered species of fish, wildlife, and
plants are of "aesthetic, ecological, educational, historical,recreational, and scientific value to the Nation and its people." 16 U. S. C. $ 1531(a)(3). Given that finding, we haveno license to demean the importance of the interest that particular individuals may have in observing any species or itshabitat, whether those individuals are motivated by esthetic
enjoyment, an interest in professional research, or an eco-nomic interest in preservation of the species. Indeed, this
Court has often held that injuries to such interests are suffi-cient to confer standing,

1 and the Court reiterates that holding today. See ante, at 562-563.The Court nevertheless concludes that respondents have

not suffered "injury in fact" because they have not shownthat the harm to the endangered species will produce "imminent" injury to them. See ante, at 564. I disagree. Aninjury to an individual's interest in studying or enjoying a
species and its natural habitat occurs when someone(whether it be the Government or a private party) takes action that harms that species and habitat. In my judgment,

1 See, e. g., Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, 734 (1972); United
States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP),
412 U. S. 669, 686-687 (1973); Japan Whaling Assn. v. American Cetacean

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
therefore, the "imminence" of such an injury should be meas-ured by the timing and likelihood of the threatened environmental harm, rather than--as the Court seems to suggest,
ante, at 564, and n. 2--by the time that might elapse between
the present and the time when the individuals would visit
the area if no such injury should occur.To understand why this approach is correct and consistent

with our precedent, it is necessary to consider the purposeof the standing doctrine. Concerned about "the proper--
and properly limited--role of the courts in a democratic soci-ety," we have long held that "Art. III judicial power exists
only to redress or otherwise to protect against injury to the
complaining party." Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 498-499
(1975). The plaintiff must have a "personal stake in the outcome" sufficient to "assure that concrete adverseness which
sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so
largely depends for illumination of difficult . . . questions."
Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 204 (1962). For that reason,
"[a]bstract injury is not enough. It must be alleged that the
plaintiff `has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury' as the result of the challenged
statute or official conduct. . . . The injury or threat of injury
must be both `real and immediate,' not `conjectural,' or `hypothetical.' " O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U. S. 488, 494 (1974)
(quoting Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U. S. 103, 109-110 (1969)).

Consequently, we have denied standing to plaintiffs whose
likelihood of suffering any concrete adverse effect from the
challenged action was speculative. See, e. g., Whitmore v.
Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 158-159 (1990); Los Angeles v.
Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 105 (1983); O'Shea, 414 U. S., at 497. In
this case, however, the likelihood that respondents will be
injured by the destruction of the endangered species is not
speculative. If respondents are genuinely interested in the
preservation of the endangered species and intend to study
or observe these animals in the future, their injury will occur
as soon as the animals are destroyed. Thus the only poten504US2$85I 02-20-99 18:37:19 PAGES OPINPGT
584 LUJAN v. DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
tial source of "speculation" in this case is whether respond-ents' intent to study or observe the animals is genuine.

2

In my view, Joyce Kelly and Amy Skilbred have introducedsufficient evidence to negate petitioner's contention that

their claims of injury are "speculative" or "conjectural." As
Justice Blackmun explains, post, at 591-592, a reasonablefinder of fact could conclude, from their past visits, their

professional backgrounds, and their affidavits and depositiontestimony, that Ms. Kelly and Ms. Skilbred will return to
the project sites and, consequently, will be injured by thedestruction of the endangered species and critical habitat.

The plurality also concludes that respondents' injuries arenot redressable in this litigation for two reasons. First, respondents have sought only a declaratory judgment that theSecretary of the Interior's regulation interpreting $ 7(a)(2)
to require consultation only for agency actions in the UnitedStates or on the high seas is invalid and an injunction requiring him to promulgate a new regulation requiring consulta-tion for agency actions abroad as well. But, the plurality
opines, even if respondents succeed and a new regulation is

2 As we recognized in Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S., at 735, the impact of changes in the esthetics or ecology of a particular area does "not
fall indiscriminately upon every citizen. The alleged injury will be felt
directly only by those who use [the area,] and for whom the aesthetic and
recreational values of the area will be lessened . . . ." Thus, respondents
would not be injured by the challenged projects if they had not visited the
sites or studied the threatened species and habitat. But, as discussed
above, respondents did visit the sites; moreover, they have expressed an
intent to do so again. This intent to revisit the area is significant evidence tending to confirm the genuine character of respondents' interest,
but I am not at all sure that an intent to revisit would be indispensable in
every case. The interest that confers standing in a case of this kind is
comparable, though by no means equivalent, to the interest in a relationship among family members that can be immediately harmed by the death
of an absent member, regardless of when, if ever, a family reunion is
planned to occur. Thus, if the facts of this case had shown repeated and
regular visits by the respondents, cf. ante, at 579 (opinion of Kennedy,
J.), proof of an intent to revisit might well be superfluous.

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
promulgated, there is no guarantee that federal agencies thatare not parties to this case will actually consult with the

Secretary. See ante, at 568-571. Furthermore, the plural-ity continues, respondents have not demonstrated that federal agencies can influence the behavior of the foreign gov-ernments where the affected projects are located. Thus,
even if the agencies consult with the Secretary and termi-nate funding for foreign projects, the foreign governments
might nonetheless pursue the projects and jeopardize the en-dangered species. See

ante, at 571. Neither of these rea-sons is persuasive.

We must presume that if this Court holds that $ 7(a)(2)requires consultation, all affected agencies would abide by
that interpretation and engage in the requisite consultations.Certainly the Executive Branch cannot be heard to argue
that an authoritative construction of the governing statuteby this Court may simply be ignored by any agency head.
Moreover, if Congress has required consultation betweenagencies, we must presume that such consultation will have
a serious purpose that is likely to produce tangible results.As

Justice Blackmun explains, post, at 599-601, it is notmere speculation to think that foreign governments, when

faced with the threatened withdrawal of United States as-sistance, will modify their projects to mitigate the harm to
endangered species. II

Although I believe that respondents have standing, I nev-ertheless concur in the judgment of reversal because I am
persuaded that the Government is correct in its submissionthat $ 7(a)(2) does not apply to activities in foreign countries.
As with all questions of statutory construction, the questionwhether a statute applies extraterritorially is one of congressional intent. Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281,284-285 (1949). We normally assume that "Congress is primarily concerned with domestic conditions," id., at 285, andtherefore presume that " `legislation of Congress, unless a

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
contrary intent appears, is meant to apply only within theterritorial jurisdiction of the United States,' " EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244, 248 (1991) (quotingFoley Bros., 336 U. S., at 285).

Section 7(a)(2) provides, in relevant part:

"Each Federal agency shall, in consultation with andwith the assistance of the Secretary [of the Interior or

Commerce, as appropriate 3], insure that any action au-thorized, funded, or carried out by such agency (hereinafter in this section referred to as an `agency action') isnot likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any
endangered species or threatened species or result inthe destruction or adverse modification of habitat of
such species which is determined by the Secretary, afterconsultation as appropriate with affected States, to be
critical, unless such agency has been granted an exemp-tion for such action by the Committee pursuant to subsection (h) of this section. . . ." 16 U. S. C. $ 1536(a)(2).
Nothing in this text indicates that the section applies in for-eign countries.

4 Indeed, the only geographic reference in

3 The ESA defines "Secretary" to mean "the Secretary of the Interior
or the Secretary of Commerce as program responsibilities are vested pursuant to the provisions of Reorganization Plan Numbered 4 of 1970." 16
U. S. C. $ 1532(15). As a general matter, "marine species are under the
jurisdiction of the Secretary of Commerce and all other species are under
the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior." 51 Fed. Reg. 19926
(1986) (preamble to final regulations governing interagency consultation
promulgated by the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine
Fisheries Service on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce).

4 Respondents point out that the duties in $ 7(a)(2) are phrased in broad,

inclusive language: "Each Federal agency" shall consult with the Secretary and ensure that "any action" does not jeopardize "any endangered or
threatened species" or destroy or adversely modify the "habitat of such
species." See Brief for Respondents 36; 16 U. S. C. $ 1536(a)(2). The
Court of Appeals correctly recognized, however, that such inclusive language, by itself, is not sufficient to overcome the presumption against the

504US2$85I 02-20-99 18:37:19 PAGES OPINPGT

587Cite as: 504 U. S. 555 (1992)
Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
the section is in the "critical habitat" clause,5 which mentions
"affected States." The Secretary of the Interior and the
Secretary of Commerce have consistently taken the position
that they need not designate critical habitat in foreign countries. See 42 Fed. Reg. 4869 (1977) (initial regulations of the
Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries
Service on behalf of the Secretary of the Interior and the
Secretary of Commerce). Consequently, neither Secretary
interprets $ 7(a)(2) to require federal agencies to engage in
consultations to ensure that their actions in foreign countries
will not adversely affect the critical habitat of endangered
or threatened species.

That interpretation is sound, and, in fact, the Court of Appeals did not question it.6 There is, moreover, no indication
that Congress intended to give a different geographic scope
to the two clauses in $ 7(a)(2). To the contrary, Congress
recognized that one of the "major causes" of extinction of

extraterritorial application of statutes. 911 F. 2d 117, 122 (CA8 1990); see
also Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S. 281, 282, 287-288 (1949) (statute
requiring an 8-hour day provision in " `[e]very contract made to which the
United States . . . is a party' " is inapplicable to contracts for work performed in foreign countries).

5 Section 7(a)(2) has two clauses which require federal agencies to consult with the Secretary to ensure that their actions (1) do not jeopardize
threatened or endangered species (the "endangered species clause"), and
(2) are not likely to destroy or adversely affect the habitat of such species
(the "critical habitat clause").

6 Instead, the Court of Appeals concluded that the endangered species

clause and the critical habitat clause are "severable," at least with respect
to their "geographical scope," so that the former clause applies extraterritorially even if the latter does not. 911 F. 2d, at 125. Under this interpretation, federal agencies must consult with the Secretary to ensure that
their actions in foreign countries are not likely to threaten any endangered
species, but they need not consult to ensure that their actions are not
likely to destroy the critical habitats of these species. I cannot subscribe
to the Court of Appeals' strained interpretation, for there is no indication
that Congress intended to give such vastly different scope to the two
clauses in $ 7(a)(2).

endangered species is the "destruction of natural habitat."S. Rep. No. 93-307, p. 2 (1973); see also H. Rep. No. 93-412,

p. 2 (1973); TVA v. Hill, 437 U. S. 153, 179 (1978). It wouldthus be illogical to conclude that Congress required federal
agencies to avoid jeopardy to endangered species abroad, but
not destruction of critical habitat abroad.The lack of an express indication that the consultation

requirement applies extraterritorially is particularly signifi-cant because other sections of the ESA expressly deal with
the problem of protecting endangered species abroad. Sec-tion 8, for example, authorizes the President to provide assistance to "any foreign country (with its consent) . . . in the
development and management of programs in that country
which [are] . . . necessary or useful for the conservation of
any endangered species or threatened species listed by the
Secretary pursuant to section 1533 of this title." 16 U. S. C.

$ 1537(a). It also directs the Secretary of the Interior,
"through the Secretary of State," to "encourage" foreign
countries to conserve fish and wildlife and to enter into
bilateral or multilateral agreements. $ 1537(b). Section 9
makes it unlawful to import endangered species into (or export them from) the United States or to otherwise traffic
in endangered species "in interstate or foreign commerce."

$$ 1538(a)(1)(A), (E), (F). Congress thus obviously thought
about endangered species abroad and devised specific sections of the ESA to protect them. In this context, the absence of any explicit statement that the consultation requirement is applicable to agency actions in foreign countries
suggests that Congress did not intend that $ 7(a)(2) apply
extraterritorially.

Finally, the general purpose of the ESA does not evince
a congressional intent that the consultation requirement be
applicable to federal agency actions abroad. The congressional findings explaining the need for the ESA emphasize
that "various species of fish, wildlife, and plants in the
United States have been rendered extinct as a consequence

of economic growth and development untempered by adequate concern and conservation," and that these species
"are of aesthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific value to the Nation and its people."

$$ 1531(1), (3) (emphasis added). The lack of similar findings
about the harm caused by development in other countries
suggests that Congress was primarily concerned with balancing development and conservation goals in this country.7

In short, a reading of the entire statute persuades me that
Congress did not intend the consultation requirement in

$ 7(a)(2) to apply to activities in foreign countries. Accordingly, notwithstanding my disagreement with the Court's
disposition of the standing question, I concur in its judgment.

Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice O'Connor
joins, dissenting.

I part company with the Court in this case in two respects.
First, I believe that respondents have raised genuine issues
of fact--sufficient to survive summary judgment--both as
to injury and as to redressability. Second, I question the
Court's breadth of language in rejecting standing for "procedural" injuries. I fear the Court seeks to impose fresh limitations on the constitutional authority of Congress to allow

7 Of course, Congress also found that "the United States has pledged
itself as a sovereign state in the international community to conserve to
the extent practicable the various species of fish or wildlife and plants
facing extinction, pursuant to [several international agreements]," and
that "encouraging the States . . . to develop and maintain conservation
programs which meet national and international standards is a key to
meeting the Nation's international commitments . . . ." 16 U. S. C.

$$ 1531(4), (5). The Court of Appeals read these findings as indicative of
a congressional intent to make $ 7(a)(2)'s consultation requirement applicable to agency action abroad. See 911 F. 2d, at 122-123. I am not persuaded, however, that such a broad congressional intent can be gleaned
from these findings. Instead, I think the findings indicate a more narrow
congressional intent that the United States abide by its international
commitments.

citizen suits in the federal courts for injuries deemed "procedural" in nature. I dissent.

I
Article III of the Constitution confines the federal courts
to adjudication of actual "Cases" and "Controversies." To
ensure the presence of a "case" or "controversy," this Court
has held that Article III requires, as an irreducible minimum,
that a plaintiff allege (1) an injury that is (2) "fairly traceable
to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct" and that is (3)
"likely to be redressed by the requested relief." Allen v.
Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751 (1984).

To survive petitioner's motion for summary judgment on
standing, respondents need not prove that they are actually
or imminently harmed. They need show only a "genuine
issue" of material fact as to standing. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.
56(c). This is not a heavy burden. A "genuine issue" exists
so long as "the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could
return a verdict for the nonmoving party [respondents]."
Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S. 242, 248 (1986).
This Court's "function is not [it]self to weigh the evidence
and determine the truth of the matter but to determine
whether there is a genuine issue for trial." Id., at 249.

The Court never mentions the "genuine issue" standard.
Rather, the Court refers to the type of evidence it feels respondents failed to produce, namely, "affidavits or other evidence showing, through specific facts" the existence of injury.
Ante, at 563. The Court thereby confuses respondents' evidentiary burden (i. e., affidavits asserting "specific facts") in
withstanding a summary judgment motion under Rule 56(e)
with the standard of proof (i. e., the existence of a "genuine
issue" of "material fact") under Rule 56(c).

Were the Court to apply the proper standard for summaryjudgment, I believe it would conclude that the sworn affidavits and deposition testimony of Joyce Kelly and Amy Skil-bred advance sufficient facts to create a genuine issue for
trial concerning whether one or both would be imminentlyharmed by the Aswan and Mahaweli projects. In the first
instance, as the Court itself concedes, the affidavits con-tained facts making it at least "questionable" (and therefore
within the province of the factfinder) that certain agency-funded projects threaten listed species.

1 Ante, at 564. The

only remaining issue, then, is whether Kelly and Skilbredhave shown that they personally would suffer imminent

harm.I think a reasonable finder of fact could conclude from the
information in the affidavits and deposition testimony thateither Kelly or Skilbred will soon return to the project sites,
thereby satisfying the "actual or imminent" injury standard.The Court dismisses Kelly's and Skilbred's general state1 The record is replete with genuine issues of fact about the harm to
endangered species from the Aswan and Mahaweli projects. For example, according to an internal memorandum of the Fish and Wildlife Service,
no fewer than eight listed species are found in the Mahaweli project area
(Indian elephant, leopard, purple-faced langur, toque macaque, red face
malkoha, Bengal monitor, mugger crocodile, and python). App. 78. The
memorandum recounts that the Sri Lankan Government has specifically
requested assistance from the Agency for International Development
(AID) in "mitigating the negative impacts to the wildlife involved." Ibid.
In addition, a letter from the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service to
AID warns: "The magnitude of the Accelerated Mahaweli Development
Program could have massive environmental impacts on such an insular
ecosystem as the Mahaweli River system." Id., at 215. It adds: "The
Sri Lankan government lacks the necessary finances to undertake any
long-term management programs to avoid the negative impacts to the
wildlife." Id., at 216. Finally, in an affidavit submitted by petitioner for
purposes of this litigation, an AID official states that an AID environmental assessment "showed that the [Mahaweli] project could affect several
endangered species." Id., at 159.

ments that they intended to revisit the project sites as "sim-ply not enough."

Ibid. But those statements did not stand
alone. A reasonable finder of fact could conclude, based notonly upon their statements of intent to return, but upon their

past visits to the project sites, as well as their professional
backgrounds, that it was likely that Kelly and Skilbred wouldmake a return trip to the project areas. Contrary to the

Court's contention that Kelly's and Skilbred's past visits"prov[e] nothing,"

ibid., the fact of their past visits could
demonstrate to a reasonable factfinder that Kelly and Skil-bred have the requisite resources and personal interest in

the preservation of the species endangered by the Aswan
and Mahaweli projects to make good on their intention to
return again. Cf. Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S. 95, 102
(1983) ("Past wrongs were evidence bearing on whether
there is a real and immediate threat of repeated injury")
(internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, Kelly's and
Skilbred's professional backgrounds in wildlife preservation,
see App. 100, 144, 309-310, also make it likely--at least far
more likely than for the average citizen--that they would
choose to visit these areas of the world where species are
vanishing.

By requiring a "description of concrete plans" or "specification of when the some day [for a return visit] will be," ante,
at 564, the Court, in my view, demands what is likely an
empty formality. No substantial barriers prevent Kelly or
Skilbred from simply purchasing plane tickets to return to
the Aswan and Mahaweli projects. This case differs from
other cases in which the imminence of harm turned largely
on the affirmative actions of third parties beyond a plaintiff 's
control. See Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 155-156
(1990) (harm to plaintiff death-row inmate from fellow inmate's execution depended on the court's one day reversing
plaintiff 's conviction or sentence and considering comparable
sentences at resentencing); Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U. S.,
at 105 (harm dependent on police's arresting plaintiff again

and subjecting him to chokehold); Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U. S.362, 372 (1976) (harm rested upon "what one of a small, unnamed minority of policemen might do to them in the futurebecause of that unknown policeman's perception of departmental disciplinary procedures"); O'Shea v. Littleton, 414
U. S. 488, 495-498 (1974) (harm from discriminatory conductof county magistrate and judge dependent on plaintiffs'

being arrested, tried, convicted, and sentenced); Golden v.
Zwickler, 394 U. S. 103, 109 (1969) (harm to plaintiff dependent on a former Congressman's (then serving a 14-year termas a judge) running again for Congress). To be sure, a plaintiff 's unilateral control over his or her exposure to harm does
not necessarily render the harm nonspeculative. Nevertheless, it suggests that a finder of fact would be far more
likely to conclude the harm is actual or imminent, especially
if given an opportunity to hear testimony and determine
credibility.

I fear the Court's demand for detailed descriptions of future conduct will do little to weed out those who are genuinely harmed from those who are not. More likely, it will
resurrect a code-pleading formalism in federal court summary judgment practice, as federal courts, newly doubting
their jurisdiction, will demand more and more particularized
showings of future harm. Just to survive summary judgment, for example, a property owner claiming a decline in
the value of his property from governmental action might
have to specify the exact date he intends to sell his property
and show that there is a market for the property, lest it be
surmised he might not sell again. A nurse turned down for
a job on grounds of her race had better be prepared to show
on what date she was prepared to start work, that she had
arranged daycare for her child, and that she would not have
accepted work at another hospital instead. And a Federal
Tort Claims Act plaintiff alleging loss of consortium should
make sure to furnish this Court with a "description of concrete plans" for her nightly schedule of attempted activities.

The Court also concludes that injury is lacking, becauserespondents' allegations of "ecosystem nexus" failed to demonstrate sufficient proximity to the site of the environmentalharm.

Ante, at 565-566. To support that conclusion, theCourt mischaracterizes our decision in Lujan v. National

Wildlife Federation, 497 U. S. 871 (1990), as establishing ageneral rule that "a plaintiff claiming injury from environmental damage must use the area affected by the challengedactivity."

Ante, at 565-566. In National Wildlife Federa-tion, the Court required specific geographical proximity because of the particular type of harm alleged in that case:harm to the plaintiff 's visual enjoyment of nature from mining activities. 497 U. S., at 888. One cannot suffer from thesight of a ruined landscape without being close enough to see
the sites actually being mined. Many environmental inju-ries, however, cause harm distant from the area immediately
affected by the challenged action. Environmental destruc-tion may affect animals traveling over vast geographical
ranges, see, e. g., Japan Whaling Assn. v. American Cetacean Society, 478 U. S. 221 (1986) (harm to American whalewatchers from Japanese whaling activities), or rivers running long geographical courses, see, e. g., Arkansas v. Oklahoma, 503 U. S. 91 (1992) (harm to Oklahoma residents fromwastewater treatment plant 39 miles from border). It cannot seriously be contended that a litigant's failure to use theprecise or exact site where animals are slaughtered or where
toxic waste is dumped into a river means he or she cannotshow injury.

The Court also rejects respondents' claim of vocational orprofessional injury. The Court says that it is "beyond all
reason" that a zoo "keeper" of Asian elephants would havestanding to contest his Government's participation in the
eradication of all the Asian elephants in another part of theworld.

Ante, at 566. I am unable to see how the distantlocation of the destruction necessarily (for purposes of ruling

at summary judgment) mitigates the harm to the elephantkeeper. If there is no more access to a future supply of the

animal that sustains a keeper's livelihood, surely there isharm.

I have difficulty imagining this Court applying its rigidprinciples of geographic formalism anywhere outside the
context of environmental claims. As I understand it, en-vironmental plaintiffs are under no special constitutional
standing disabilities. Like other plaintiffs, they need showonly that the action they challenge has injured them, without
necessarily showing they happened to be physically near thelocation of the alleged wrong. The Court's decision today
should not be interpreted "to foreclose the possibility . . .that in different circumstances a nexus theory similar to
those proffered here might support a claim to standing."Ante, at 579 (

A plurality of the Court suggests that respondents havenot demonstrated redressability: a likelihood that a court

ruling in their favor would remedy their injury. Duke
Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc.,438 U. S. 59, 74-75, and n. 20 (1978) (plaintiff must show "substantial likelihood" that relief requested will redress the in-jury). The plurality identifies two obstacles. The first is
that the "action agencies" (e. g., AID) cannot be required toundertake consultation with petitioner Secretary, because
they are not directly bound as parties to the suit and areotherwise not indirectly bound by being subject to petitioner
Secretary's regulation. Petitioner, however, officially andpublicly has taken the position that his regulations regarding
consultation under $ 7 of the Act are binding on action agen-cies. 50 CFR $ 402.14(a) (1991).

taken the same position in this very litigation, having statedin his answer to the complaint that petitioner "admits the

Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) was designated the leadagency for the formulation of regulations concerning section
7 of the [Endangered Species Act]." App. 246. I cannotagree with the plurality that the Secretary (or the Solicitor
General) is now free, for the convenience of this appeal, todisavow his prior public and litigation positions. More generally, I cannot agree that the Government is free to play"Three-Card Monte" with its description of agencies' authority to defeat standing against the agency given the lead inadministering a statutory scheme.

Emphasizing that none of the action agencies are partiesto this suit (and having rejected the possibility of their being
indirectly bound by petitioner's regulation), the pluralityconcludes that "there is no reason they should be obliged
to honor an incidental legal determination the suit pro-duced." Ante, at 569. I am not as willing as the plurality
is to assume that agencies at least will not try to follow thelaw. Moreover, I wonder if the plurality has not overlooked
the extensive involvement from the inception of this liti-gation by the Department of State and AID.

action may affect listed species or critical habitat. If such a determination is made, formal consultation is required . . . ."

The Secretary's intent to make the regulations binding upon other agencies is even clearer from the discussion accompanying promulgation of the
consultation rules. See 51 Fed. Reg. 19928 (1986) ("Several commenters
stated that Congress did not intend that the Service interpret or implement section 7, and believed that the Service should recast the regulations
as `nonbinding guidelines' that would govern only the Service's role in
consultation . . . . The Service is satisfied that it has ample authority and
legislative mandate to issue this rule, and believes that uniform consultation standards and procedures are necessary to meet its obligations under
section 7").

3 For example, petitioner's motion before the District Court to dismiss

the complaint identified four attorneys from the Department of State and
AID (an agency of the Department of State) as "counsel" to the attorneys
from the Justice Department in this action. One AID lawyer actually

principles of collateral estoppel, these agencies are precluded
from subsequently relitigating the issues decided in this
suit.

"[O]ne who prosecutes or defends a suit in the name of
another to establish and protect his own right, or who
assists in the prosecution or defense of an action in aid
of some interest of his own, and who does this openly to
the knowledge of the opposing party, is as much bound
by the judgment and as fully entitled to avail himself of
it as an estoppel against an adverse party, as he would
be if he had been a party to the record." Souffront v.
Compagnie des Sucreries de Porto Rico, 217 U. S. 475,
487 (1910).

This principle applies even to the Federal Government. In
Montana v. United States, 440 U. S. 147 (1979), this Court
held that the Government was estopped from relitigating in
federal court the constitutionality of Montana's gross receipts tax, because that issue previously had been litigated
in state court by an individual contractor whose litigation
had been financed and controlled by the Federal Government. "Thus, although not a party, the United States
plainly had a sufficient `laboring oar' in the conduct of the
state-court litigation to actuate principles of estoppel." Id.,
at 155. See also United States v. Mendoza, 464 U. S. 154,
164, n. 9 (1984) (Federal Government estopped where it "constituted a `party' in all but a technical sense"). In my view,
the action agencies have had sufficient "laboring oars" in this
litigation since its inception to be bound from subsequent

entered a formal appearance before the District Court on behalf of AID.
On at least one occasion petitioner requested an extension of time to file
a brief, representing that " `[a]n extension is necessary for the Department
of Justice to consult with . . . the Department of State [on] the brief.' "
See Brief for Respondents 31, n. 8. In addition, AID officials have offered
testimony in this action.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
relitigation of the extraterritorial scope of the $ 7 consultation requirement.4 As a result, I believe respondents' injury would likely be redressed by a favorable decision.

4 The plurality now suggests that collateral-estoppel principles can have
no application here, because the participation of other agencies in this
litigation arose after its inception. Borrowing a principle from this
Court's statutory diversity jurisdiction cases and transferring it to the
constitutional standing context, the Court observes: " `The existence of
federal jurisdiction ordinarily depends on the facts as they exist when the
complaint is filed.' " Ante, at 569, n. 4 (quoting Newman-Green, Inc. v.
Alfonzo-Larrain, 490 U. S. 826, 830 (1989)). See also Mollan v. Torrance,
9 Wheat. 537, 539 (1824) (Marshall, C. J.). The plurality proclaims that
"[i]t cannot be" that later participation of other agencies in this suit retroactively created a jurisdictional issue that did not exist at the outset.
Ante, at 570, n. 4.

The plurality, however, overlooks at least three difficulties with this
explanation. In the first place, assuming that the plurality were correct
that events as of the initiation of the lawsuit are the only proper jurisdictional reference point, were the Court to follow this rule in this case there
would be no question as to the compliance of other agencies, because, as
stated at an earlier point in the opinion: "When the Secretary promulgated
the regulation at issue here, he thought it was binding on the agencies."
Ante, at 569. This suit was commenced in October 1986, just three months
after the regulation took effect. App. 21; 51 Fed. Reg. 19926 (1986). As
the plurality further admits, questions about compliance of other agencies
with the Secretary's regulation arose only by later participation of the
Solicitor General and other agencies in the suit. Ante, at 569. Thus, it
was, to borrow the plurality's own words, "assuredly not true when this
suit was filed, naming the Secretary alone," ante, at 569, n. 4, that there was
any question before the District Court about other agencies being bound.

Second, were the plurality correct that, for purposes of determining
redressability, a court may look only to facts as they exist when the complaint is filed, then the Court by implication would render a nullity part
of Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 19 provides in
part for the joinder of persons if "in the person's absence complete relief
cannot be accorded among those already parties." This presupposes nonredressability at the outset of the litigation. Under the plurality's rationale, a district court would have no authority to join indispensable parties,
because it would, as an initial matter, have no jurisdiction for lack of the
power to provide redress at the outset of the litigation.

Third, the rule articulated in Newman-Green is that the existence of
federal jurisdiction "ordinarily" depends on the facts at the initiation of

504US2$85F 02-20-99 18:37:19 PAGES OPINPGT

599Cite as: 504 U. S. 555 (1992)
Blackmun, J., dissenting
The second redressability obstacle relied on by the plural-ity is that "the [action] agencies generally supply only a fraction of the funding for a foreign project." Ante, at 571.What this Court might "generally" take to be true does not
eliminate the existence of a genuine issue of fact to with-stand summary judgment. Even if the action agencies supply only a fraction of the funding for a particular foreignproject, it remains at least a question for the finder of fact
whether threatened withdrawal of that fraction would affectforeign government conduct sufficiently to avoid harm to
listed species.The plurality states that "AID, for example, has provided
less than 10% of the funding for the Mahaweli project."Ibid. The plurality neglects to mention that this "fraction"
amounts to $170 million, see App. 159, not so paltry a sumfor a country of only 16 million people with a gross national
product of less than $6 billion in 1986 when respondents filed
the lawsuit. This is no ironclad per se rule without exceptions. Had the
Solicitor General, for example, taken a position during this appeal that
the $ 7 consultation requirement does in fact apply extraterritorially, the
controversy would be moot, and this Court would be without jurisdiction.

In the plurality's view, federal subject-matter jurisdiction appears to be
a one-way street running the Executive Branch's way. When the Executive Branch wants to dispel jurisdiction over an action against an agency,
it is free to raise at any point in the litigation that other nonparty agencies
might not be bound by any determinations of the one agency defendant.
When a plaintiff, however, seeks to preserve jurisdiction in the face of a
claim of nonredressability, the plaintiff is not free to point to the involvement of nonparty agencies in subsequent parts of the litigation. The plurality does not explain why the street runs only one way--why some actions of the Executive Branch subsequent to initiation of a lawsuit are
cognizable for jurisdictional purposes but others simply are not.

More troubling still is the distance this one-way street carries the plurality from the underlying purpose of the standing doctrine. The purpose
of the standing doctrine is to ensure that courts do not render advisory
opinions rather than resolve genuine controversies between adverse parties. Under the plurality's analysis, the federal courts are to ignore their
present ability to resolve a concrete controversy if at some distant point
in the past it could be said that redress could not have been provided.
The plurality perverts the standing inquiry.

the complaint in this action. Federal Research Division, Library of Congress, Sri Lanka: A Country Study (Area Handbook Series) xvi-xvii (1990).

The plurality flatly states: "Respondents have produced
nothing to indicate that the projects they have named will
. . . do less harm to listed species, if that fraction is eliminated." Ante, at 571. As an initial matter, the relevant inquiry is not, as the plurality suggests, what will happen if
AID or other agencies stop funding projects, but what will
happen if AID or other agencies comply with the consultation requirement for projects abroad. Respondents filed
suit to require consultation, not a termination of funding.
Respondents have raised at least a genuine issue of fact
that the projects harm endangered species and that the actions of AID and other United States agencies can mitigate
that harm.

The plurality overlooks an Interior Department memorandum listing eight endangered or threatened species in the
Mahaweli project area and recounting that "[t]he Sri Lankan
government has requested the assistance of AID in mitigating the negative impacts to the wildlife involved." App. 78.
Further, a letter from the Director of the Fish and Wildlife
Service to AID states:

"The Sri Lankan government lacks the necessary finances to undertake any long-term management programs to avoid the negative impacts to the wildlife.
The donor nations and agencies that are financing the
[Mahaweli project] will be the key as to how successfully
the wildlife is preserved. If wildlife problems receive
the same level of attention as the engineering project,
then the negative impacts to the environment can be
alleviated. This means that there has to be long-term
funding in sufficient amounts to stem the negative impacts of this project." Id., at 216.

I do not share the plurality's astonishing confidence that, onthe record here, a factfinder could only conclude that AID

was powerless to ensure the protection of listed species atthe Mahaweli project.

As for the Aswan project, the record again rebuts theplurality's assumption that donor agencies are without any
authority to protect listed species. Kelly asserted in heraffidavit--and it has not been disputed--that the Bureau
of Reclamation was "overseeing" the rehabilitation of theAswan project.

Id., at 101. See also id., at 65 (Bureau ofReclamation publication stating: "In 1982, the Egyptian government . . . requested that Reclamation serve as its engi-neering advisor for the nine-year [Aswan] rehabilitation
project").I find myself unable to agree with the plurality's analysis
of redressability, based as it is on its invitation of executivelawlessness, ignorance of principles of collateral estoppel, unfounded assumptions about causation, and erroneous conclu-sions about what the record does not say. In my view, respondents have satisfactorily shown a genuine issue of factas to whether their injury would likely be redressed by a
decision in their favor. II

The Court concludes that any "procedural injury" sufferedby respondents is insufficient to confer standing. It rejects
the view that the "injury-in-fact requirement [is] satisfied bycongressional conferral upon all persons of an abstract, selfcontained, noninstrumental `right' to have the Executiveobserve the procedures required by law." Ante, at 573.
Whatever the Court might mean with that very broad lan-guage, it cannot be saying that "procedural injuries"

as aclass are necessarily insufficient for purposes of Article III

standing.Most governmental conduct can be classified as "procedural." Many injuries caused by governmental conduct,therefore, are categorizable at some level of generality as

Blackmun, J., dissenting
"procedural" injuries. Yet, these injuries are not categori-cally beyond the pale of redress by the federal courts.

When the Government, for example, "procedurally" issues apollution permit, those affected by the permittee's pollutants
are not without standing to sue. Only later cases will tell
just what the Court means by its intimation that "proce-dural" injuries are not constitutionally cognizable injuries.

In the meantime, I have the greatest of sympathy for thecourts across the country that will struggle to understand
the Court's standardless exposition of this concept today.The Court expresses concern that allowing judicial enforcement of "agencies' observance of a particular, statutorily prescribed procedure" would "transfer from the President to the courts the Chief Executive's most important
constitutional duty, to `take Care that the Laws be faithfully
executed,' Art. II, $ 3." Ante, at 576, 577. In fact, the principal effect of foreclosing judicial enforcement of such procedures is to transfer power into the hands of the Executive at
the expense--not of the courts--but of Congress, from which
that power originates and emanates.

Under the Court's anachronistically formal view of the
separation of powers, Congress legislates pure, substantive
mandates and has no business structuring the procedural
manner in which the Executive implements these mandates.
To be sure, in the ordinary course, Congress does legislate in
black-and-white terms of affirmative commands or negative
prohibitions on the conduct of officers of the Executive
Branch. In complex regulatory areas, however, Congress
often legislates, as it were, in procedural shades of gray.
That is, it sets forth substantive policy goals and provides
for their attainment by requiring Executive Branch officials
to follow certain procedures, for example, in the form of reporting, consultation, and certification requirements.

The Court recently has considered two such procedurally
oriented statutes. In Japan Whaling Assn. v. American
Cetacean Society, 478 U. S. 221 (1986), the Court examined a

statute requiring the Secretary of Commerce to certify tothe President that foreign nations were not conducting fishing operations or trading which "diminis[h] the effective-ness" of an international whaling convention.

Id., at 226.
The Court expressly found standing to sue. Id., at 230-231,
n. 4. In Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490U. S. 332, 348 (1989), this Court considered injury from violation of the "action-forcing" procedures of the National Envi-ronmental Policy Act (NEPA), in particular the requirements for issuance of environmental impact statements.The consultation requirement of $ 7 of the Endangered
Species Act is a similar, action-forcing statute. Consultation is designed as an integral check on federal agency action, ensuring that such action does not go forward without
full consideration of its effects on listed species. Once consultation is initiated, the Secretary is under a duty to provide
to the action agency "a written statement setting forth the
Secretary's opinion, and a summary of the information on
which the opinion is based, detailing how the agency action affects the species or its critical habitat." 16 U. S. C.

$ 1536(b)(3)(A). The Secretary is also obligated to suggest
"reasonable and prudent alternatives" to prevent jeopardy
to listed species. Ibid. The action agency must undertake
as well its own "biological assessment for the purpose of
identifying any endangered species or threatened species"
likely to be affected by agency action. $ 1536(c)(1). After
the initiation of consultation, the action agency "shall not
make any irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources" which would foreclose the "formulation or implementation of any reasonable and prudent alternative measures" to avoid jeopardizing listed species. $ 1536(d). These
action-forcing procedures are "designed to protect some
threatened concrete interest," ante, at 573, n. 8, of persons
who observe and work with endangered or threatened species. That is why I am mystified by the Court's unsupported conclusion that "[t]his is not a case where plaintiffs

are seeking to enforce a procedural requirement the disre-gard of which could impair a separate concrete interest of

theirs." Ante, at 572.Congress legislates in procedural shades of gray not to
aggrandize its own power but to allow maximum Executive
discretion in the attainment of Congress' legislative goals.Congress could simply impose a substantive prohibition on

Executive conduct; it could say that no agency action shallresult in the loss of more than 5% of any listed species. Instead, Congress sets forth substantive guidelines and allowsthe Executive, within certain procedural constraints, to decide how best to effectuate the ultimate goal. See American Power & Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U. S. 90, 105 (1946). The
Court never has questioned Congress' authority to impose
such procedural constraints on Executive power. Just as
Congress does not violate separation of powers by structuring the procedural manner in which the Executive shall carry
out the laws, surely the federal courts do not violate separation of powers when, at the very instruction and command
of Congress, they enforce these procedures.

To prevent Congress from conferring standing for "procedural injuries" is another way of saying that Congress may
not delegate to the courts authority deemed "executive" in
nature. Ante, at 577 (Congress may not "transfer from the
President to the courts the Chief Executive's most important
constitutional duty, to `take Care that the Laws be faithfully
executed,' Art. II, $ 3"). Here Congress seeks not to delegate "executive" power but only to strengthen the procedures it has legislatively mandated. "We have long recognized that the nondelegation doctrine does not prevent
Congress from seeking assistance, within proper limits, from
its coordinate Branches." Touby v. United States, 500 U. S.
160, 165 (1991). "Congress does not violate the Constitution
merely because it legislates in broad terms, leaving a certain
degree of discretion to executive or judicial actors." Ibid.
(emphasis added).

Blackmun, J., dissenting
Ironically, this Court has previously justified a relaxed re-view of congressional delegation to the Executive on grounds

that Congress, in turn, has subjected the exercise of thatpower to judicial review.

INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 953-
954, n. 16 (1983); American Power & Light Co. v. SEC, 329
U. S., at 105-106. The Court's intimation today that proce-dural injuries are not constitutionally cognizable threatens

this understanding upon which Congress has undoubtedly re-lied. In no sense is the Court's suggestion compelled by our
"common understanding of what activities are appropriate tolegislatures, to executives, and to courts."

Ante, at 560. In
my view, it reflects an unseemly solicitude for an expansion
of power of the Executive Branch.

It is to be hoped that over time the Court will acknowledge that some classes of procedural duties are so enmeshed
with the prevention of a substantive, concrete harm that an
individual plaintiff may be able to demonstrate a sufficient
likelihood of injury just through the breach of that procedural duty. For example, in the context of the NEPA requirement of environmental-impact statements, this Court
has acknowledged "it is now well settled that NEPA itself
does not mandate particular results [and] simply prescribes
the necessary process," but "these procedures are almost
certain to affect the agency's substantive decision." Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U. S., at 350
(emphasis added). See also Andrus v. Sierra Club, 442 U. S.
347, 350-351 (1979) ("If environmental concerns are not interwoven into the fabric of agency planning, the `actionforcing' characteristics of [the environmental-impact statement requirement] would be lost"). This acknowledgment
of an inextricable link between procedural and substantive
harm does not reflect improper appellate factfinding. It reflects nothing more than the proper deference owed to the
judgment of a coordinate branch--Congress--that certain
procedures are directly tied to protection against a substantive harm.

In short, determining "injury" for Article III standingpurposes is a fact-specific inquiry. "Typically . . . the standing inquiry requires careful judicial examination of a com-plaint's allegations to ascertain whether the particular plaintiff is entitled to an adjudication of the particular claimsasserted."

Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S., at 752. There maybe factual circumstances in which a congressionally imposed

procedural requirement is so insubstantially connected to theprevention of a substantive harm that it cannot be said to
work any conceivable injury to an individual litigant. But,as a general matter, the courts owe substantial deference
to Congress' substantive purpose in imposing a certain pro-cedural requirement. In all events, "[o]ur separation-ofpowers analysis does not turn on the labeling of an activityas `substantive' as opposed to `procedural.' "

Mistretta v.United States, 488 U. S. 361, 393 (1989). There is no room

for a per se rule or presumption excluding injuries labeled"procedural" in nature.

III
In conclusion, I cannot join the Court on what amounts to aslash-and-burn expedition through the law of environmental

standing. In my view, "[t]he very essence of civil libertycertainly consists in the right of every individual to claim
the protection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury."Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 163 (1803).

REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA et al. v. WELTOVER,INC.,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 91-763. Argued April 1, 1992--Decided June 12, 1992
As part of a plan to stabilize petitioner Argentina's currency, that country and petitioner bank (collectively Argentina) issued bonds, called
"Bonods," which provided for repayment in United States dollars
through transfer on the market in one of several locations, including
New York City. Concluding that it lacked sufficient foreign exchange
to retire the Bonods when they began to mature, Argentina unilaterally
extended the time for payment and offered bondholders substitute instruments as a means of rescheduling the debts. Respondent bondholders, two Panamanian corporations and a Swiss bank, declined to accept
the rescheduling and insisted on repayment in New York. When Argentina refused, respondents brought this breach-of-contract action in
the District Court, which denied Argentina's motion to dismiss. The
Court of Appeals affirmed, ruling that the District Court had jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), 28
U. S. C. $ 1602 et seq., which subjects foreign states to suit in American
courts for, inter alia, acts taken "in connection with a commercial activity" that have "a direct effect in the United States," $ 1605(a)(2).

Held: The District Court properly asserted jurisdiction under the FSIA.

Pp. 610-620.

(a) The issuance of the Bonods was a "commercial activity" under the
FSIA, and the rescheduling of the maturity dates on those instruments
was taken "in connection with" that activity within the meaning of

$ 1605(a)(2). When a foreign government acts, not as a regulator of a
market, but in the manner of a private player within that market, its
actions are "commercial" within the meaning of the FSIA. Cf. Alfred
Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba, 425 U. S. 682, 695-706
(plurality opinion). Moreover, because $ 1603(d) provides that the commercial character of an act is to be determined by reference to its "nature" rather than its "purpose," the question is not whether the foreign
government is acting with a profit motive or instead with the aim of
fulfilling uniquely sovereign objectives. Rather, the issue is whether
the government's particular actions (whatever the motive behind them)
are the type of actions by which a private party engages in commerce.
The Bonods are in almost all respects garden-variety debt instruments,

Syllabus
and, even when they are considered in full context, there is nothing
about their issuance that is not analogous to a private commercial transaction. The fact that they were created to help stabilize Argentina's
currency is not a valid basis for distinguishing them from ordinary debt
instruments, since, under $ 1603(d), it is irrelevant why Argentina participated in the bond market in the manner of a private actor. It matters only that it did so. Pp. 612-617.

(b) The unilateral rescheduling of the Bonods had a "direct effect in
the United States" within the meaning of $ 1605(a)(2). Respondents
had designated their accounts in New York as the place of payment,
and Argentina made some interest payments into those accounts before
announcing that it was rescheduling the payments. Because New York
was thus the place of performance for Argentina's ultimate contractual
obligations, the rescheduling of those obligations necessarily had a "direct effect" in this country: Money that was supposed to have been delivered to a New York bank was not forthcoming. Argentina's suggestion that the "direct effect" requirement cannot be satisfied where the
plaintiffs are all foreign corporations with no other connections to this
country is untenable under Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria,
461 U. S. 480, 489. Moreover, assuming that a foreign state may be a
"person" for purposes of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, Argentina satisfied the "minimum contacts" test of International
Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310, 316, by issuing negotiable debt
instruments denominated in United States dollars and payable in New
York and by appointing a financial agent in that city. Pp. 617-620.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case requires us to decide whether the Republic ofArgentina's default on certain bonds issued as part of a plan

to stabilize its currency was an act taken "in connection witha commercial activity" that had a "direct effect in the United
States" so as to subject Argentina to suit in an Americancourt under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976,
28 U. S. C. $ 1602 et seq. I

Since Argentina's currency is not one of the mediums ofexchange accepted on the international market, Argentine
businesses engaging in foreign transactions must pay inUnited States dollars or some other internationally accepted
currency. In the recent past, it was difficult for Argentineborrowers to obtain such funds, principally because of the
instability of the Argentine currency. To address theseproblems, petitioners, the Republic of Argentina and its
central bank, Banco Central (collectively Argentina), in 1981instituted a foreign exchange insurance contract program
(FEIC), under which Argentina effectively agreed to assumethe risk of currency depreciation in cross-border transactions
involving Argentine borrowers. This was accomplished byArgentina's agreeing to sell to domestic borrowers, in exchange for a contractually predetermined amount of localcurrency, the necessary United States dollars to repay their
foreign debts when they matured, irrespective of interven-ing devaluations.

Unfortunately, Argentina did not possess sufficient re-serves of United States dollars to cover the FEIC contracts
as they became due in 1982. The Argentine Governmentthereupon adopted certain emergency measures, including
refinancing of the FEIC-backed debts by issuing to the credi-tors government bonds. These bonds, called "Bonods," provide for payment of interest and principal in United Statesdollars; payment may be made through transfer on the London, Frankfurt, Zurich, or New York market, at the election

610 REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA v. WELTOVER, INC.

Opinion of the Court
of the creditor. Under this refinancing program, the foreigncreditor had the option of either accepting the Bonods in satisfaction of the initial debt, thereby substituting the Argen-tine Government for the private debtor, or maintaining the
debtor/creditor relationship with the private borrower andaccepting the Argentine Government as guarantor.

When the Bonods began to mature in May 1986, Argentinaconcluded that it lacked sufficient foreign exchange to retire
them. Pursuant to a Presidential Decree, Argentina unilat-erally extended the time for payment and offered bondholders substitute instruments as a means of rescheduling thedebts. Respondents, two Panamanian corporations and a
Swiss bank who hold, collectively, $1.3 million of Bonods, re-fused to accept the rescheduling and insisted on full payment, specifying New York as the place where paymentshould be made. Argentina did not pay, and respondents
then brought this breach-of-contract action in the UnitedStates District Court for the Southern District of New York,
relying on the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 asthe basis for jurisdiction. Petitioners moved to dismiss for
lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, lack of personal jurisdic-tion, and

forum non conveniens. The District Court deniedthese motions, 753 F. Supp. 1201 (1991), and the Court of

Appeals affirmed, 941 F. 2d 145 (CA2 1991). We grantedArgentina's petition for certiorari, which challenged the
Court of Appeals' determination that, under the Act, Argen-tina was not immune from the jurisdiction of the federal
courts in this case. 502 U. S. 1024 (1992).

II
The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), 28U. S. C. $ 1602 et seq., establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether a court in this country, stateor federal, may exercise jurisdiction over a foreign state.
Under the Act, a "foreign state shall be immune from thejurisdiction of the courts of the United States and of the

611Cite as: 504 U. S. 607 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
States" unless one of several statutorily defined exceptionsapplies. $ 1604 (emphasis added). The FSIA thus provides

the "sole basis" for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreignsovereign in the United States. See Argentine Republic v.
Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U. S. 428, 434-439 (1989).The most significant of the FSIA's exceptions--and the one
at issue in this case--is the "commercial" exception of$ 1605(a)(2), which provides that a foreign state is not immune from suit in any case

"in which the action is based upon a commercial activitycarried on in the United States by the foreign state; or

upon an act performed in the United States in connec-tion with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere; or upon an act outside the territory of the UnitedStates in connection with a commercial activity of the
foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct ef-fect in the United States." $ 1605(a)(2).

In the proceedings below, respondents relied only on thethird clause of $ 1605(a)(2) to establish jurisdiction, 941 F. 2d,
at 149, and our analysis is therefore limited to consideringwhether this lawsuit is (1) "based . . . upon an act outside
the territory of the United States"; (2) that was taken "inconnection with a commercial activity" of Argentina outside
this country; and (3) that "cause[d] a direct effect in theUnited States."

1 The complaint in this case alleges only one

cause of action on behalf of each of the respondents, viz.,a breach-of-contract claim based on Argentina's attempt to

refinance the Bonods rather than to pay them according totheir terms. The fact that the cause of action is in compliance with the first of the three requirements--that it is"based upon an act outside the territory of the United

1 It is undisputed that both the Republic of Argentina and Banco Central
are "foreign states" within the meaning of the FSIA. See 28 U. S. C.

Opinion of the Court
States" (presumably Argentina's unilateral extension)--isuncontested. The dispute pertains to whether the unilateral refinancing of the Bonods was taken "in connection witha commercial activity" of Argentina, and whether it had a
"direct effect in the United States." We address these is-sues in turn.

A
Respondents and their amicus, the United States, contendthat Argentina's issuance of, and continued liability under,

the Bonods constitute a "commercial activity" and that theextension of the payment schedules was taken "in connection
with" that activity. The latter point is obvious enough, andArgentina does not contest it; the key question is whether
the activity is "commercial" under the FSIA.The FSIA defines "commercial activity" to mean:

"[E]ither a regular course of commercial conduct or aparticular commercial transaction or act. The commercial character of an activity shall be determined by ref-erence to the nature of the course of conduct or particular transaction or act, rather than by reference to itspurpose." 28 U. S. C. $ 1603(d).

This definition, however, leaves the critical term "commer-cial" largely undefined: The first sentence simply establishes
that the commercial nature of an activity does not dependupon whether it is a single act or a regular course of conduct;
and the second sentence merely specifies what element of theconduct determines commerciality (

i. e., nature rather thanpurpose), but still without saying what "commercial" means.

Fortunately, however, the FSIA was not written on a cleanslate. As we have noted, see

Verlinden B. V. v. CentralBank of Nigeria, 461 U. S. 480, 486-489 (1983), the Act (and

the commercial exception in particular) largely codifies theso-called "restrictive" theory of foreign sovereign immunity
first endorsed by the State Department in 1952. The mean-ing of "commercial" is the meaning generally attached to that

term under the restrictive theory at the time the statute wasenacted. See

McDermott Int'l, Inc. v. Wilander, 498 U. S.
337, 342 (1991) ("[W]e assume that when a statute uses [aterm of art], Congress intended it to have its established

meaning"); NLRB v. Amax Coal Co., 453 U. S. 322, 329
(1981); Morissette v. United States, 342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952).This Court did not have occasion to discuss the scope or

validity of the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity untilour 1976 decision in

Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba, 425 U. S. 682. Although the Court therewas evenly divided on the question whether the "commercial" exception that applied in the foreign-sovereignimmunity context also limited the availability of an act-ofstate defense, compare id., at 695-706 (plurality opinion),
with id., at 725-730 (Marshall, J., dissenting), there was little
disagreement over the general scope of the exception. The
plurality noted that, after the State Department endorsed
the restrictive theory of foreign sovereign immunity in 1952,
the lower courts consistently held that foreign sovereigns
were not immune from the jurisdiction of American courts
in cases "arising out of purely commercial transactions," id.,
at 703, citing, inter alia, Victory Transport, Inc. v. Comisaria General, 336 F. 2d 354 (CA2 1964), cert. denied, 381 U. S.
934 (1965), and Petrol Shipping Corp. v. Kingdom of Greece,
360 F. 2d 103 (CA2), cert. denied, 385 U. S. 931 (1966). The
plurality further recognized that the distinction between
state sovereign acts, on the one hand, and state commercial
and private acts, on the other, was not entirely novel to
American law. See 425 U. S., at 695-696, citing, inter alia,
Parden v. Terminal Railway of Alabama Docks Dept., 377
U. S. 184, 189-190 (1964) (Eleventh Amendment immunity);
Bank of United States v. Planters' Bank of Georgia, 9
Wheat. 904, 907-908 (1824) (same); New York v. United
States, 326 U. S. 572, 579 (1946) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.)
(tax immunity of States); and South Carolina v. United
States, 199 U. S. 437, 461-463 (1905) (same). The plurality

614 REPUBLIC OF ARGENTINA v. WELTOVER, INC.

Opinion of the Court
stated that the restrictive theory of foreign sovereign immu-nity would not bar a suit based upon a foreign state's participation in the marketplace in the manner of a private citizenor corporation. 425 U. S., at 698-705. A foreign state engaging in "commercial" activities "do[es] not exercise powers
peculiar to sovereigns"; rather, it "exercise[s] only thosepowers that can also be exercised by private citizens."

Id.,
at 704. The dissenters did not disagree with this generaldescription. See

id., at 725. Given that the FSIA was enacted less than six months after our decision in Alfred Dunhill was announced, we think the plurality's contemporaneous description of the then-prevailing restrictive theory of
sovereign immunity is of significant assistance in construing
the scope of the Act.

In accord with that description, we conclude that when a
foreign government acts, not as regulator of a market, but
in the manner of a private player within it, the foreign sovereign's actions are "commercial" within the meaning of the
FSIA. Moreover, because the Act provides that the commercial character of an act is to be determined by reference
to its "nature" rather than its "purpose," 28 U. S. C. $ 1603(d),
the question is not whether the foreign government is acting
with a profit motive or instead with the aim of fulfilling
uniquely sovereign objectives. Rather, the issue is whether
the particular actions that the foreign state performs (whatever the motive behind them) are the type of actions by
which a private party engages in "trade and traffic or commerce," Black's Law Dictionary 270 (6th ed. 1990). See,
e. g., Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center v. Hellenic Republic, 877 F. 2d 574, 578 (CA7), cert. denied, 493
U. S. 937 (1989). Thus, a foreign government's issuance of
regulations limiting foreign currency exchange is a sovereign
activity, because such authoritative control of commerce cannot be exercised by a private party; whereas a contract to
buy army boots or even bullets is a "commercial" activity,
because private companies can similarly use sales contracts

to acquire goods, see, e. g., Stato di Rumania v. Trutta,[1926] Foro It. I 584, 585-586, 589 (Corte di Cass. del Regno,

Italy), translated and reprinted in part in 26 Am. J. Int'l L.626-629 (Supp. 1932).

The commercial character of the Bonods is confirmed by
the fact that they are in almost all respects garden-varietydebt instruments: They may be held by private parties; they

are negotiable and may be traded on the international mar-ket (except in Argentina); and they promise a future stream
of cash income. We recognize that, prior to the enactmentof the FSIA, there was authority suggesting that the issuance of public debt instruments did not constitute a commercial activity. Victory Transport, 336 F. 2d, at 360 (dicta).
There is, however, nothing distinctive about the state's assumption of debt (other than perhaps its purpose) that would
cause it always to be classified as jure imperii, and in this
regard it is significant that Victory Transport expressed
confusion as to whether the "nature" or the "purpose" of a
transaction was controlling in determining commerciality,
id., at 359-360. Because the FSIA has now clearly established that the "nature" governs, we perceive no basis for
concluding that the issuance of debt should be treated as
categorically different from other activities of foreign states.

Argentina contends that, although the FSIA bars consideration of "purpose," a court must nonetheless fully consider
the context of a transaction in order to determine whether
it is "commercial." Accordingly, Argentina claims that the
Court of Appeals erred by defining the relevant conduct in
what Argentina considers an overly generalized, acontextual
manner and by essentially adopting a per se rule that all
"issuance of debt instruments" is "commercial." See 941 F.

a commercial activity within the meaning of [the FSIA]' "),
quoting Shapiro v. Republic of Bolivia, 930 F. 2d 1013, 1018

Opinion of the Court
is nothing about the issuance of these Bonods (except per-haps its purpose) that is not analogous to a private commercial transaction.Argentina points to the fact that the transactions in which
the Bonods were issued did not have the ordinary commercial consequence of raising capital or financing acquisitions.Assuming for the sake of argument that this is not an example of judging the commerciality of a transaction by its pur-pose, the ready answer is that private parties regularly issue
bonds, not just to raise capital or to finance purchases, butalso to refinance debt. That is what Argentina did here: By
virtue of the earlier FEIC contracts, Argentina was already
obligated to supply the United States dollars needed to retire the FEIC-insured debts; the Bonods simply allowed Argentina to restructure its existing obligations. Argentina
further asserts (without proof or even elaboration) that it
"received consideration [for the Bonods] in no way commensurate with [their] value," Brief for Petitioners 22. Assuming that to be true, it makes no difference. Engaging in
a commercial act does not require the receipt of fair value,
or even compliance with the common-law requirements of
consideration.

Argentina argues that the Bonods differ from ordinary
debt instruments in that they "were created by the Argentine Government to fulfill its obligations under a foreign exchange program designed to address a domestic credit crisis,
and as a component of a program designed to control that
nation's critical shortage of foreign exchange." Id., at 23-
24. In this regard, Argentina relies heavily on De Sanchez
v. Banco Central de Nicaragua, 770 F. 2d 1385 (1985), in
which the Fifth Circuit took the view that "[o]ften, the essence of an act is defined by its purpose"; that unless "we
can inquire into the purposes of such acts, we cannot determine their nature"; and that, in light of its purpose to control
its reserves of foreign currency, Nicaragua's refusal to honor
a check it had issued to cover a private bank debt was a

sovereign act entitled to immunity. Id., at 1393. Indeed,Argentina asserts that the line between "nature" and "purpose" rests upon a "formalistic distinction [that] simply isneither useful nor warranted." Reply Brief for Petitioners
8. We think this line of argument is squarely foreclosed bythe language of the FSIA. However difficult it may be in
some cases to separate "purpose" (i. e., the reason why theforeign state engages in the activity) from "nature" (

i. e., theoutward form of the conduct that the foreign state performs

or agrees to perform), see De Sanchez, supra, at 1393, thestatute unmistakably commands that to be done, 28 U. S. C.

$ 1603(d). We agree with the Court of Appeals, see 941F. 2d, at 151, that it is irrelevant

why Argentina participatedin the bond market in the manner of a private actor; it matters only that it did so. We conclude that Argentina's issu-ance of the Bonods was a "commercial activity" under the
FSIA. B

The remaining question is whether Argentina's unilateralrescheduling of the Bonods had a "direct effect" in the
United States, 28 U. S. C. $ 1605(a)(2). In addressing thisissue, the Court of Appeals rejected the suggestion in the
legislative history of the FSIA that an effect is not "direct"unless it is both "substantial" and "foreseeable." 941 F. 2d,
at 152; contra, America West Airlines, Inc. v. GPA Group,
Ltd., 877 F. 2d 793, 798-800 (CA9 1989); Zernicek v. Brown &Root, Inc., 826 F. 2d 415, 417-419 (CA5 1987), cert. denied,

That suggestion is found in the House Report, which statesthat conduct covered by the third clause of $ 1605(a)(2) would
be subject to the jurisdiction of American courts "consistentwith principles set forth in section 18, Restatement of the

Law, Second, Foreign Relations Law of the United States(1965)." H. R. Rep. No. 94-1487, p. 19 (1976). Section 18

states that American laws are not given extraterritorial ap-plication except with respect to conduct that has, as a "direct
and foreseeable result," a "substantial" effect within the
United States. Since this obviously deals with jurisdictionto

legislate rather than jurisdiction to adjudicate, this passage of the House Report has been charitably described as"a bit of a

non sequitur," Texas Trading & Milling Corp. v.
Federal Republic of Nigeria, 647 F. 2d 300, 311 (CA2 1981),cert. denied, 454 U. S. 1148 (1982). Of course the generally

applicable principle de minimis non curat lex ensures that
jurisdiction may not be predicated on purely trivial effects
in the United States. But we reject the suggestion that

$ 1605(a)(2) contains any unexpressed requirement of "substantiality" or "foreseeability." As the Court of Appeals
recognized, an effect is "direct" if it follows "as an immediate
consequence of the defendant's . . . activity." 941 F. 2d, at
152.

The Court of Appeals concluded that the rescheduling of
the maturity dates obviously had a "direct effect" on respondents. It further concluded that that effect was sufficiently "in the United States" for purposes of the FSIA, in
part because "Congress would have wanted an American
court to entertain this action" in order to preserve New York
City's status as "a preeminent commercial center." Id., at
153. The question, however, is not what Congress "would
have wanted" but what Congress enacted in the FSIA. Although we are happy to endorse the Second Circuit's recognition of "New York's status as a world financial leader," the
effect of Argentina's rescheduling in diminishing that status
(assuming it is not too speculative to be considered an effect
at all) is too remote and attenuated to satisfy the "direct
effect" requirement of the FSIA. Ibid.

We nonetheless have little difficulty concluding that Argentina's unilateral rescheduling of the maturity dates on the

Opinion of the Court
Bonods had a "direct effect" in the United States. Respond-ents had designated their accounts in New York as the place

of payment, and Argentina made some interest paymentsinto those accounts before announcing that it was rescheduling the payments. Because New York was thus the place ofperformance for Argentina's ultimate contractual obligations, the rescheduling of those obligations necessarily had a"direct effect" in the United States: Money that was supposed to have been delivered to a New York bank for depositwas not forthcoming. We reject Argentina's suggestion
that the "direct effect" requirement cannot be satisfiedwhere the plaintiffs are all foreign corporations with no
other connections to the United States. We expresslystated in Verlinden that the FSIA permits "a foreign plaintiff to sue a foreign sovereign in the courts of the UnitedStates, provided the substantive requirements of the Act are
satisfied," 461 U. S., at 489.Finally, Argentina argues that a finding of jurisdiction in
this case would violate the Due Process Clause of the FifthAmendment, and that, in order to avoid this difficulty, we
must construe the "direct effect" requirement as embodyingthe "minimum contacts" test of

International Shoe Co. v.Washington, 326 U. S. 310, 316 (1945).

2 Assuming, without

deciding, that a foreign state is a "person" for purposes ofthe Due Process Clause, cf.

South Carolina v. Katzenbach,383 U. S. 301, 323-324 (1966) (States of the Union are not

"persons" for purposes of the Due Process Clause), we findthat Argentina possessed "minimum contacts" that would
satisfy the constitutional test. By issuing negotiable debtinstruments denominated in United States dollars and payable in New York and by appointing a financial agent in that

interpreting the direct effect requirement of the Act" and that "[w]hether
there is a constitutional basis for personal jurisdiction over [Argentina] is
not before the Court as an independent question." Brief for Petitioners

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION v. TICOR TITLEINSURANCE CO.

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 91-72. Argued January 13, 1992--Decided June 12, 1992
Petitioner Federal Trade Commission filed an administrative complaint

charging respondent title insurance companies with horizontal price
fixing in setting fees for title searches and examinations in violation of

$ 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. In each of the four
States at issue--Connecticut, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Montana--uniform rates were established by a rating bureau licensed by the State
and authorized to establish joint rates for its members. Rate filings
were made to the state insurance office and became effective unless the
State rejected them within a specified period. The Administrative Law
Judge held, inter alia, that the rates had been fixed in all four States,
but that, in Wisconsin and Montana, respondents' anticompetitive activities were entitled to state-action immunity, as contemplated in Parker
v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341, and its progeny. Under this doctrine, a state
law or regulatory scheme can be the basis for antitrust immunity if
the State (1) has articulated a clear and affirmative policy to allow the
anticompetitive conduct and (2) provides active supervision of anticompetitive conduct undertaken by private actors. California Retail
Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U. S. 97, 105. The
Commission, which conceded that the first part of the test was met, held
on review that none of the States had conducted sufficient supervision to warrant immunity. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that
the existence of a state regulatory program, if staffed, funded, and empowered by law, satisfied the active supervision requirement. Thus, it
concluded, respondents' conduct in all the States was entitled to stateaction immunity.

Held:

1. State-action immunity is not available under the regulatory
schemes in Montana and Wisconsin. Pp. 632-640.

(a) Principles of federalism require that federal antitrust laws be
subject to supersession by state regulatory programs. Parker, supra,
at 350-352; Midcal, supra; Patrick v. Burget, 486 U. S. 94. Midcal's
two-part test confirms that States may not confer antitrust immunity
on private persons by fiat. Actual state involvement is the precondition
for immunity, which is conferred out of respect for the State's ongoing

504us2$87L 04-05-96 17:44:16 PAGES OPINPGT
622 FTC v. TICOR TITLE INS. CO.

Syllabus
regulation, not the economics of price restraint. The purpose of the
active supervision inquiry is to determine whether the State has exercised sufficient independent judgment and control so that the details of
the rates or prices have been established as a product of deliberate
state intervention. Although this immunity doctrine was developed in
actions brought under the Sherman Act, the issue whether it applies to
Commission action under the Federal Trade Commission Act need not
be determined, since the Commission does not assert any superior preemption authority here. Pp. 632-635.

(b) Wisconsin, Montana, and 34 other States correctly contend
that a broad interpretation of state-action immunity would not serve
their best interests. The doctrine would impede, rather than advance,
the States' freedom of action if it required them to act in the shadow of
such immunity whenever they entered the realm of economic regulation.
Insistence on real compliance with both parts of the Midcal test serves
to make clear that the States are responsible for only the price fixing
they have sanctioned and undertaken to control. Respondents' contention that such concerns are better addressed by the first part of the
Midcal test misapprehends the close relation between Midcal's two
elements, which are both directed at ensuring that particular anticompetitive mechanisms operate because of a deliberate and intended state
policy. A clear policy statement ensures only that the State did not act
through inadvertence, not that the State approved the anticompetitive
conduct. Sole reliance on the clear articulation requirement would not
allow the States sufficient regulatory flexibility. Pp. 635-637.

(c) Where prices or rates are initially set by private parties, subject
to veto only if the State chooses, the party claiming the immunity must
show that state officials have undertaken the necessary steps to determine the specifics of the price-fixing or ratesetting scheme. The mere
potential for state supervision is not an adequate substitute for the
State's decision. Thus, the standard relied on by the Court of Appeals
in this case is insufficient to establish the requisite level of active supervision. The Commission's findings of fact demonstrate that the potential for state supervision was not realized in either Wisconsin or Montana. While most rate filings were checked for mathematical accuracy,
some were unchecked altogether. Moreover, one rate filing became
effective in Montana despite the rating bureau's failure to provide requested information, and additional information was provided in Wisconsin after seven years, during which time another rate filing remained
in effect. Absent active supervision, there can be no state-action immunity for what were otherwise private price-fixing arrangements.
And state judicial review cannot fill the void. See Patrick, supra, at
103-105. This Court's decision in Southern Motor Carriers Rate Con504us2$87L 04-05-96 17:44:16 PAGES OPINPGT

ference, Inc. v. United States, 471 U. S. 48, which involved a similar
negative option regime, is not to the contrary, since it involved the question whether the first part of the Midcal test was met. This case involves horizontal price fixing under a vague imprimatur in form and
agency inaction in fact, and it should be read in light of the gravity of
the antitrust offense, the involvement of private actors throughout, and
the clear absence of state supervision. Pp. 637-640.

2. The Court of Appeals should have the opportunity to reexamine
its determinations with respect to Connecticut and Arizona in order to
address whether it accorded proper deference to the Commission's factual findings as to the extent of state supervision in those States. P. 640.

companies, alleging horizontal price fixing in their fees fortitle searches and title examinations. One company settled

by consent decree, while five other firms continue to contestthe matter. The Commission charged the title companies
with violating $ 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act,38 Stat. 719, 15 U. S. C. $ 45(a)(1), which prohibits "[u]nfair
methods of competition in or affecting commerce." One ofthe principal defenses the companies assert is state-action
immunity from antitrust prosecution, as contemplated in theline of cases beginning with

Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341(1943). The Commission rejected this defense, In re Ticor

Title Ins. Co., 112 F. T. C. 344 (1989), and the firms soughtreview in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third

Title insurance is the business of insuring the record titleof real property for persons with some interest in the estate,

Opinion of the Court
policy, the insurance company or one of its agents performs
a title search and examination. The search produces a
chronological list of the public documents in the chain of title
to the real property. The examination is a critical analysis
or interpretation of the condition of title revealed by the documents disclosed through this search.

The title search and examination are major components of
the insurance company's services. There are certain variances from State to State and from policy to policy, but a
brief summary of the functions performed by the title companies can be given. The insurance companies exclude from
coverage defects uncovered during the search; that is, the
insurers conduct searches in order to inform the insured and
to reduce their own liability by identifying and excluding
known risks. The insured is protected from some losses resulting from title defects not discoverable from a search of
the public records, such as forgery, missing heirs, previous
marriages, impersonation, or confusion in names. They are
protected also against errors or mistakes in the search and
examination. Negligence need not be proved in order to recover. Title insurance also includes the obligation to defend
in the event that an insured is sued by reason of some defect
within the scope of the policy's guarantee.

The title insurance industry earned $1.35 billion in gross
revenues in 1982, and respondents accounted for 57 percent
of that amount. Four of respondents are the nation's largest
title insurance companies: Ticor Title Insurance Co., with
16.5 percent of the market; Chicago Title Insurance Co., with
12.8 percent; Lawyers Title Insurance Co., with 12 percent;
and SAFECO Title Insurance Co. (now operating under the
name Security Union Title Insurance Co.), with 10.3 percent.
Stewart Title Guarantee Co., with 5.4 percent of the market,
is the country's eighth largest title insurer, with a strong
position in the West and Southwest. App. to Pet. for Cert.

Opinion of the Court
The Commission issued an administrative complaint in1985. Horizontal price fixing was alleged in these terms:

" `Respondents have agreed on the prices to be chargedfor title search and examination services or settlement
services through rating bureaus in various states. Ex-amples of states in which one or more of the respondents have fixed prices with other respondents or othercompetitors for all or part of their search and examination services or settlement services are Arizona, Con-necticut, Idaho, Louisiana, Montana, New Jersey, New
Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Wyoming.' " 112 F. T. C., at 346.

The Commission did not challenge the insurers' practice ofsetting uniform rates for insurance against the risk of loss

from defective titles, but only the practice of setting uniform
rates for the title search, examination, and settlement, as-pects of the business which, the Commission alleges, do not

involve insurance.Before the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), respondents
defended against liability on three related grounds. First,they maintained that the challenged conduct is exempt
from antitrust scrutiny under the McCarran-Ferguson Act,59 Stat. 34, 15 U. S. C. $ 1012(b), which confers antitrust
immunity over the "business of insurance" to the extent regulated by state law. Second, they argued that their collec-tive ratemaking activities are exempt under the

NoerrPennington doctrine, which places certain "[ j]oint efforts toinfluence public officials" beyond the reach of the antitrust

laws. Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U. S. 657, 670
(1965); Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr
Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U. S. 127, 136 (1961). Third, respondents contended their activities are entitled to stateaction immunity, which permits anticompetitive conduct if
authorized and supervised by state officials. See California
Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 97 (1980); Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341 (1943). App.to Pet. for Cert. 218a. As to one State, Ohio, respondents

contended that the rates for title search, examination, andsettlement had not been set by a rating bureau.

Title insurance company rates and practices in 13 States
were the subject of the initial complaint. Before the matterwas decided by the ALJ, the Commission declined to pursue

its complaint with regard to fees in five of these States:Louisiana, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, and Wyoming.
Upon the recommendation of the ALJ, the Commission didnot pursue its complaint with regard to fees in two additional
States, Idaho and Ohio. This left six States in which the
Commission found antitrust violations, but in two of these
States, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the Commission conceded the issue on which certiorari was sought here, so the
regulatory regimes in these two States are not before us.
Four States remain in which violations were alleged: Connecticut, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Montana.

The ALJ held that the rates for search and examination
services had been fixed in these four States. For reasons we
need not pause to examine, the ALJ rejected the McCarranFerguson and Noerr-Pennington defenses. The ALJ then
turned his attention to the question of state-action immunity.
A summary of the ALJ's extensive findings on this point is
necessary for a full understanding of the decisions reached
at each level of the proceedings in the case.

Rating bureaus are private entities organized by title insurance companies to establish uniform rates for their members. The ALJ found no evidence that the collective setting
of title insurance rates through rating bureaus is a way of
pooling risk information. Indeed, he found no evidence that
any title insurer sets rates according to actuarial loss experience. Instead, the ALJ found that the usual practice is for
rating bureaus to set rates according to profitability studies
that focus on the costs of conducting searches and examinations. Uniform rates are set notwithstanding differences in

Opinion of the Court
efficiencies and costs among individual members. App. to
Pet. for Cert. 183a-184a.

The ALJ described the regulatory regimes for title insurance rates in the four States still at issue. In each one, the
title insurance rating bureau was licensed by the State and
authorized to establish joint rates for its members. Each of
the four States used what has come to be called a "negative
option" system to approve rate filings by the bureaus.
Under a negative option system, the rating bureau filed rates
for title searches and title examinations with the state insurance office. The rates became effective unless the State
rejected them within a specified period, such as 30 days. Although the negative option system provided a theoretical
mechanism for substantive review, the ALJ determined,
after making detailed findings regarding the operation of
each regulatory regime, that the rate filings were subject to
minimal scrutiny by state regulators.

In Connecticut the State Insurance Department has the
authority to audit the rating bureau and hold hearings regarding rates, but it has not done so. The Connecticut rating bureau filed only two major rate increases, in 1966 and
in 1981. The circumstances behind the 1966 rate increase
are somewhat obscure. The ALJ found that the Insurance
Department asked the rating bureau to submit additional information justifying the increase, and later approved the
rate increase although there is no evidence the additional
information was provided. In 1981 the Connecticut rating
bureau filed for a 20 percent rate increase. The factual
background for this rate increase is better developed though
the testimony was somewhat inconsistent. A state insurance official testified that he reviewed the rate increase with
care and discussed various components of the increase with
the rating bureau. The same official testified, however, that
he lacked the authority to question certain expense data he
considered quite high. Id., at 189a-195a.

Opinion of the Court
In Wisconsin the State Insurance Commissioner is required to examine the rating bureau at regular intervals and
authorized to reject rates through a process of hearings.
Neither has been done. The Wisconsin rating bureau made
major rate filings in 1971, 1981, and 1982. The 1971 rate
filing was approved in 1971 although supporting justification,
which had been requested by the State Insurance Commissioner, was not provided until 1978. The 1981 rate filing
requested an 11 percent rate increase. The increase was
approved after the office of the Insurance Commissioner
checked the supporting data for accuracy. No one in the
agency inquired into insurer expenses, though an official
testified that substantive scrutiny would not be possible
without that inquiry. The 1982 rate increase received but a
cursory reading at the office of the Insurance Commissioner.
The supporting materials were not checked for accuracy,
though in the absence of an objection by the agency, the rate
increase went into effect. Id., at 196a-200a.

In Arizona the Insurance Director was required to examine the rating bureau at least once every five years. It was
not done. In 1980 the State Insurance Department announced a comprehensive investigation of the rating bureau.
It was not conducted. The rating bureau spent most of its
time justifying its escrow rates. Following conclusion in
1981 of a federal civil suit challenging the joint fixing of escrow rates, the rating bureau went out of business without
having made any major rate filings, though it had proposed
minor rate adjustments. Id., at 200a-205a.

In Montana the rating bureau made its only major rate
filing in 1983. In connection with it, a representative of the
rating bureau met with officials of the State Insurance Department. He was told that the filed rates could go into
immediate effect though further profit data would have to be
provided. The ALJ found no evidence that the additional
data were furnished. Id., at 211a-214a.

Opinion of the Court
To complete the background, the ALJ observed that noneof the rating bureaus are now active. The respondents

abandoned them between 1981 and 1985 in response to nu-merous private treble-damages suits, so by the time the
Commission filed its formal complaint in 1985, the rating bureaus had been dismantled. Id., at 195a, 200a, 205a, 208a.The ALJ held that the case is not moot, though, because

nothing would preclude respondents from resuming theconduct challenged by the Commission.

Id., at 246a-247a.
See United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629, 632-633(1953).

These factual determinations established, the ALJ addressed the two-part test that must be satisfied for stateaction immunity under the antitrust laws, the test we set out
in California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U. S. 97 (1980). A state law or regulatory
scheme cannot be the basis for antitrust immunity unless,
first, the State has articulated a clear and affirmative policy
to allow the anticompetitive conduct, and second, the State
provides active supervision of anticompetitive conduct undertaken by private actors. Id., at 105. The Commission
having conceded that the first part of the test was satisfied
in the four States still at issue, the immunity question, beginning with the hearings before the ALJ and in all later proceedings, has turned upon the proper interpretation and
application of Midcal's active supervision requirement. The

ALJ found the active supervision test was met in Arizona
and Montana but not in Connecticut or Wisconsin. App. to
Pet. for Cert. 248a.

On review of the ALJ's decision, the Commission held that
none of the four States had conducted sufficient supervision,
so that the title companies were not entitled to immunity in
any of those jurisdictions. Id., at 47a. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit disagreed with the Commission,
adopting the approach of the First Circuit in New England
Motor Rate Bureau, Inc. v. FTC, 908 F. 2d 1064 (1990), which

504us2$87L 04-05-96 17:44:16 PAGES OPINPGT
632 FTC v. TICOR TITLE INS. CO.

Opinion of the Court
had held that the existence of a state regulatory program, if
staffed, funded, and empowered by law, satisfied the requirement of active supervision. Id., at 1071. Under this standard, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that
the active state supervision requirement was met in all four
States and held that the respondents' conduct was entitled
to state-action immunity in each of them. 922 F. 2d, at 1140.

We granted certiorari to consider two questions: First,
whether the Third Circuit was correct in its statement of the
law and in its application of law to fact, and second, whether
the Third Circuit exceeded its authority by departing from
the factual findings entered by the ALJ and adopted by the
Commission. Before this Court, the parties have confined
their briefing on the first of these questions to the regulatory
regimes of Wisconsin and Montana, and focused on the regulatory regimes of Connecticut and Arizona in briefing on the
second question. We now reverse the Court of Appeals
under the first question and remand for further proceedings
under the second.

II

The preservation of the free market and of a system of
free enterprise without price fixing or cartels is essential to
economic freedom. United States v. Topco Associates, Inc.,
405 U. S. 596, 610 (1972). A national policy of such a pervasive and fundamental character is an essential part of the
economic and legal system within which the separate States
administer their own laws for the protection and advancement of their people. Continued enforcement of the national
antitrust policy grants the States more freedom, not less, in
deciding whether to subject discrete parts of the economy
to additional regulations and controls. Against this background, in Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341 (1943), we upheld
a state-supervised, market sharing scheme against a Sherman Act challenge. We announced the doctrine that federal
antitrust laws are subject to supersession by state regula504us2$87L 04-05-96 17:44:16 PAGES OPINPGT

633Cite as: 504 U. S. 621 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
tory programs. Our decision was grounded in principles of
federalism. Id., at 350-352.

The principle of freedom of action for the States, adopted
to foster and preserve the federal system, explains the later
evolution and application of the Parker doctrine in our decisions in Midcal, supra, and Patrick v. Burget, 486 U. S. 94
(1988). In Midcal we invalidated a California statute forbidding licensees in the wine trade to sell below prices set
by the producer. There we announced the two-part test applicable to instances where private parties participate in a
price-fixing regime. "First, the challenged restraint must
be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as
state policy; second, the policy must be actively supervised
by the State itself." 445 U. S., at 105 (internal quotation
marks omitted). Midcal confirms that while a State may
not confer antitrust immunity on private persons by fiat, it
may displace competition with active state supervision if the
displacement is both intended by the State and implemented
in its specific details. Actual state involvement, not deference to private price-fixing arrangements under the general
auspices of state law, is the precondition for immunity from
federal law. Immunity is conferred out of respect for ongoing regulation by the State, not out of respect for the
economics of price restraint. In Midcal we found that the
intent to restrain prices was expressed with sufficient precision so that the first part of the test was met, but that the
absence of state participation in the mechanics of the price
posting was so apparent that the requirement of active supervision had not been met. Ibid.

The rationale was further elaborated in Patrick v. Burget.
In Patrick it had been alleged that private physicians participated in the State's peer review system in order to injure
or destroy competition by denying hospital privileges to a
physician who had begun a competing clinic. We referred
to the purpose of preserving the State's own administrative

Opinion of the Court
policies, as distinct from allowing private parties to foreclosecompetition, in the following passage:

"The active supervision requirement stems from the rec-ognition that where a private party is engaging in the
anticompetitive activity, there is a real danger that heis acting to further his own interests, rather than the
governmental interests of the State. . . . The require-ment is designed to ensure that the state-action doctrine
will shelter only the particular anticompetitive acts ofprivate parties that, in the judgment of the State, actually further state regulatory policies. To accomplish
this purpose, the active supervision requirement man-dates that the State exercise ultimate control over the

challenged anticompetitive conduct. . . . The mere pres-ence of some state involvement or monitoring does not
suffice. . . . The active supervision prong of the Midcaltest requires that state officials have and exercise power
to review particular anticompetitive acts of private parties and disapprove those that fail to accord with statepolicy. Absent such a program of supervision, there is

no realistic assurance that a private party's anticompeti-tive conduct promotes state policy, rather than merely
the party's individual interests." 486 U. S., at 100-101(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).

Because the particular anticompetitive conduct at issue in
Patrick had not been supervised by governmental actors, we
decided that the actions of the peer review committee werenot entitled to state-action immunity.

Id., at 106.
Our decisions make clear that the purpose of the active
supervision inquiry is not to determine whether the State
has met some normative standard, such as efficiency, in its
regulatory practices. Its purpose is to determine whether
the State has exercised sufficient independent judgment and
control so that the details of the rates or prices have been
established as a product of deliberate state intervention, not

Opinion of the Court
simply by agreement among private parties. Much as incausation inquiries, the analysis asks whether the State has

played a substantial role in determining the specifics of theeconomic policy. The question is not how well state regulation works but whether the anticompetitive scheme is the
State's own.Although the point bears but brief mention, we observe

that our prior cases considered state-action immunityagainst actions brought under the Sherman Act, and this
case arises under the Federal Trade Commission Act. TheCommission has argued at other times that state-action immunity does not apply to Commission action under $ 5 of the
Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 45. See U. S.
Bureau of Consumer Protection, Staff Report to the Federal
Trade Commission on Prescription Drug Price Disclosures,
Chs. VI(B) and (C) (1975); see also Note, The State Action
Exemption and Antitrust Enforcement under the Federal
Trade Commission Act, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 715 (1976). A leading treatise has expressed its skepticism of this view. See
1 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law || 218 (1978). We
need not determine whether the antitrust statutes can be
distinguished on this basis, because the Commission does not
assert any superior pre-emption authority in the instant
matter. We apply our prior cases to the one before us.

Respondents contend that principles of federalism justify
a broad interpretation of state-action immunity, but there is
a powerful refutation of their viewpoint in the briefs that
were filed in this case. The State of Wisconsin, joined by
Montana and 34 other States, has filed a brief as amici curiae on the precise point. These States deny that respondents' broad immunity rule would serve the States' best interests. We are in agreement with the amici submission.

If the States must act in the shadow of state-action immunity whenever they enter the realm of economic regulation,
then our doctrine will impede their freedom of action, not
advance it. The fact of the matter is that the States regu504us2$87L 04-05-96 17:44:16 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
late their economies in many ways not inconsistent with theantitrust laws. For example, Oregon may provide for peer

review by its physicians without approving anticompetitiveconduct by them. See

Patrick, 486 U. S., at 105. Or Michigan may regulate its public utilities without authorizing
monopolization in the market for electric light bulbs. See
Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U. S. 579, 596 (1976). So we
have held that state-action immunity is disfavored, much asare repeals by implication.

Lafayette v. Louisiana Power &
Light Co., 435 U. S. 389, 398-399 (1978). By adhering inmost cases to fundamental and accepted assumptions about

the benefits of competition within the framework of the antitrust laws, we increase the States' regulatory flexibility.

States must accept political responsibility for actions they
intend to undertake. It is quite a different matter, however,
for federal law to compel a result that the States do not intend but for which they are held to account. Federalism
serves to assign political responsibility, not to obscure it.
Neither federalism nor political responsibility is well served
by a rule that essential national policies are displaced by
state regulations intended to achieve more limited ends.
For States which do choose to displace the free market with
regulation, our insistence on real compliance with both parts
of the Midcal test will serve to make clear that the State is
responsible for the price fixing it has sanctioned and undertaken to control.

Respondents contend that these concerns are better addressed by the requirement that the States articulate a clear
policy to displace the antitrust laws with their own forms
of economic regulation. This contention misapprehends the
close relation between Midcal's two elements. Both are directed at ensuring that particular anticompetitive mechanisms operate because of a deliberate and intended state policy. See Patrick, supra, at 100. In the usual case, Midcal's
requirement that the State articulate a clear policy shows
little more than that the State has not acted through inad504us2$87L 04-05-96 17:44:16 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
vertence; it cannot alone ensure, as required by our prece-dents, that particular anticompetitive conduct has been approved by the State. It seems plain, moreover, in light ofthe amici curiae brief to which we have referred, that sole
reliance on the requirement of clear articulation will notallow the regulatory flexibility that these States deem necessary. For States whose object it is to benefit their citizensthrough regulation, a broad doctrine of state-action immunity may serve as nothing more than an attractive nuisancein the economic sphere. To oppose these pressures, sole reliance on the requirement of clear articulation could becomea rather meaningless formal constraint.

III
In the case before us, the Court of Appeals relied upon aformulation of the active supervision requirement articulated by the First Circuit:

" `Where . . . the state's program is in place, is staffedand funded, grants to the state officials ample power and

the duty to regulate pursuant to declared standards ofstate policy, is enforceable in the state's courts, and demonstrates some basic level of activity directed towardsseeing that the private actors carry out the state's policy
and not simply their own policy, more need not be estab-lished.' " 922 F. 2d, at 1136, quoting

New England
Motor Rate Bureau, Inc. v. FTC, 908 F. 2d, at 1071.

Based on this standard, the Third Circuit ruled that the ac-tive supervision requirement was met in all four States, and

held that the respondents' conduct was entitled to state-action immunity from antitrust liability. 922 F. 2d, at 1140.

While in theory the standard articulated by the First Cir-cuit might be applied in a manner consistent with our precedents, it seems to us insufficient to establish the requisitelevel of active supervision. The criteria set forth by the
First Circuit may have some relevance as the beginning

Opinion of the Court
point of the active state supervision inquiry, but the analysiscannot end there. Where prices or rates are set as an initial

matter by private parties, subject only to a veto if the Statechooses to exercise it, the party claiming the immunity must
show that state officials have undertaken the necessary steps
to determine the specifics of the price-fixing or ratesettingscheme. The mere potential for state supervision is not

an adequate substitute for a decision by the State. Underthese standards, we must conclude that there was no active
supervision in either Wisconsin or Montana.Respondents point out that in Wisconsin and Montana the
rating bureaus filed rates with state agencies and that in
both States the so-called negative option rule prevailed.
The rates became effective unless they were rejected within
a set time. It is said that as a matter of law in those States
inaction signified substantive approval. This proposition
cannot be reconciled, however, with the detailed findings, entered by the ALJ and adopted by the Commission, which
demonstrate that the potential for state supervision was not
realized in fact. The ALJ found, and the Commission
agreed, that at most the rate filings were checked for mathematical accuracy. Some were unchecked altogether. In
Montana, a rate filing became effective despite the failure of
the rating bureau to provide additional requested information. In Wisconsin, additional information was provided
after a lapse of seven years, during which time the rate filing
remained in effect. These findings are fatal to respondents'
attempts to portray the state regulatory regimes as providing the necessary component of active supervision. The
findings demonstrate that, whatever the potential for state
regulatory review in Wisconsin and Montana, active state
supervision did not occur. In the absence of active supervision in fact, there can be no state-action immunity for what
were otherwise private price-fixing arrangements. And as
in Patrick, the availability of state judicial review could not
fill the void. Because of the state agencies' limited role and

participation, state judicial review was likewise limited.See

Patrick, 486 U. S., at 103-105.
Our decision in Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. United States, 471 U. S. 48 (1985), though it too
involved a negative option regime, is not to the contrary.
The question there was whether the first part of the Midcaltest was met, the Government's contention being that a pricing policy is not an articulated one unless the practice is com-pelled. We rejected that assertion and undertook no real
examination of the active supervision aspect of the case, forthe Government conceded that the second part of the test
had been met. Id., at 62, 66. The concession was against
the background of a District Court determination that, although submitted rates could go into effect without further
state activity, the State had ordered and held ratemaking
hearings on a consistent basis, using the industry submissions as the beginning point. See United States v. Southern
Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc., 467 F. Supp. 471, 476-
477 (ND Ga. 1979). In the case before us, of course, the
Commission concedes the first part of the Midcal requirement and litigates the second; and there is no finding of substantial state participation in the ratesetting scheme.

This case involves horizontal price fixing under a vague
imprimatur in form and agency inaction in fact. No antitrust offense is more pernicious than price fixing. FTC v.
Superior Court Trial Lawyers Assn., 493 U. S. 411, 434, n. 16
(1990). In this context, we decline to formulate a rule that
would lead to a finding of active state supervision where in
fact there was none. Our decision should be read in light of
the gravity of the antitrust offense, the involvement of private actors throughout, and the clear absence of state supervision. We do not imply that some particular form of state
or local regulation is required to achieve ends other than
the establishment of uniform prices. Cf. Columbia v. Omni
Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499 U. S. 365 (1991) (city billboard
zoning ordinance entitled to state-action immunity). We do

not have before us a case in which governmental actors madeunilateral decisions without participation by private actors.

Cf. Fisher v. Berkeley, 475 U. S. 260 (1986) (private actorsnot liable without private action). And we do not here call
into question a regulatory regime in which sampling tech-niques or a specified rate of return allow state regulators
to provide comprehensive supervision without complete con-trol, or in which there was an infrequent lapse of state supervision. Cf. 324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy, 479 U. S. 335, 344,n. 6 (1987) (a statute specifying the margin between wholesale and retail prices may satisfy the active supervision re-quirement). In the circumstances of this case, however, we
conclude that the acts of respondents in the States of Mon-tana and Wisconsin are not immune from antitrust liability.

IV
In granting certiorari we undertook to review the furthercontention by the Commission that the Court of Appeals was

incorrect in disregarding the Commission's findings as to theextent of state supervision. The parties have focused their
briefing on this question on the regulatory schemes ofConnecticut and Arizona. We think the Court of Appeals
should have the opportunity to reexamine its determinationswith respect to these latter two States in light of the views
we have expressed.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia, concurring.
The Court's standard is in my view faithful to what ourcases have said about "active supervision." On the other

hand, I think The Chief Justice and Justice O'Connorare correct that this standard will be a fertile source of uncertainty and (hence) litigation, and will produce total aban504us2$87L 04-05-96 17:44:16 PAGES OPINPGT

donment of some state programs because private individuals
will not take the chance of participating in them. That is
true, moreover, not just in the "negative option" context, but
even in a context such as that involved in Patrick v. Burget,
486 U. S. 94 (1988): Private physicians invited to participate
in a state-supervised hospital peer review system may not
know until after their participation has occurred (and indeed
until after their trial has been completed) whether the
State's supervision will be "active" enough.

I am willing to accept these consequences because I see no
alternative within the constraints of our "active supervision"
doctrine, which has not been challenged here; and because I
am skeptical about the Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S. 341 (1943),
exemption for state-programmed private collusion in the
first place.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice O'Connor and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The Court holds today that to satisfy the "active supervision" requirement of state-action immunity from antitrust
liability, private parties acting pursuant to a regulatory
scheme enacted by a state legislature must prove that "the
State has played a substantial role in determining the specifics of the economic policy." Ante, at 635. Because this
standard is neither supported by our prior precedent nor
sound as a matter of policy, I dissent.

Immunity from antitrust liability under the state-action
doctrine was first established in Parker v. Brown, 317 U. S.
341 (1943). As noted by the majority, in Parker we relied
on principles of federalism in concluding that the Sherman
Act did not apply to state officials administering a regulatory
program enacted by the state legislature. We concluded
that state action is exempt from antitrust liability, because
in the Sherman Act Congress evidences no intent to "restrain state action or official action directed by a state." Id.,

at 351.1 "The Parker decision was premised on the assump-tion that Congress, in enacting the Sherman Act, did not

intend to compromise the States' ability to regulate theirdomestic commerce." Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. United States, 471 U. S. 48, 56 (1985) (foot-note omitted).

We developed our present analysis for state-action immu-nity for private actors in

California Retail Liquor DealersAssn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U. S. 97 (1980). We

held in Midcal that our prior precedent had granted state-action immunity from antitrust liability to conduct by private actors where a program was "clearly articulated andaffirmatively expressed as state policy [and] the policy [was]
actively supervised by the State itself." Id., at 105 (internalquotation marks and citation omitted). In

Midcal, we foundthe active supervision requirement was not met because

under the California statute at issue, which required liquorretailers to charge a certain percentage above a price
"posted" by area wholesalers, "[t]he State has no direct con-trol over wine prices, and it does not review the reasonableness of the prices set by wine dealers." Id., at 100. Wenoted that the state-action defense does not allow the States
to authorize what is nothing more than private price fixing.

that the active supervision requirement for state-action im-munity was not met, the state regulators lacked authority,

1 The Court states that "[c]ontinued enforcement of the national antitrust policy grants the States more freedom, not less, in deciding whether
to subject discrete parts of the economy to additional regulations and controls," ante, at 632. However, in Parker, we held that the Sherman Act
simply does not apply to conduct regulated by the State. The enforcement of the national antitrust policy, as embodied in the antitrust laws,
may grant individuals more freedom to compete in our free market system, but it does not implicate the freedom of the States in deciding
whether to regulate.

by the private actors facing antitrust liability.2 Our mostrecent formulation of the "active supervision" requirement

was announced in Patrick v. Burget, 486 U. S. 94 (1988),where we concluded that to satisfy the "active supervision"
requirement, "state officials [must] have and exercise powerto review particular anticompetitive acts of private parties
and disapprove those that fail to accord with state policy."
Id., at 101. Until today, therefore, we have never had occa-sion to determine whether a state regulatory program which

gave state officials authority--"power"--to review and regu-late prices or conduct, might still fail to meet the requirement for active state supervision because the State's regula-tion was not sufficiently detailed or rigorous.

Addressing this question, the Court of Appeals in this caseused the following analysis:

" `Where, as here, the state's program is in place, isstaffed and funded, grants to the state officials ample
power and the duty to regulate pursuant to declaredstandards of state policy, is enforceable in the state's
courts, and demonstrates some basic level of activity di-rected towards seeing that the private actors carry out
the state's policy and not simply their own policy, moreneed not be established.' " 922 F. 2d 1122, 1136 (CA3
1991), quoting New England Motor Rate Bureau, Inc.v. FTC, 908 F. 2d 1064, 1071 (CA1 1990).

The Court likens this test to doing away all together withthe active supervision requirement for immunity based on
state action. But the test used by the Court of Appeals is

2 In 324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy, 479 U. S. 335 (1987), we held that a New
York statute failed to shelter private actors from antitrust liability because the state legislation required retailers to charge 112% of the price
"posted" by wholesalers. The New York statute, like the California statute at issue in California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U. S. 97 (1980), gave no power to the state agency to review
or establish the reasonableness of the price schedules "posted" by the
wholesalers. 324 Liquor, supra, at 345.

much more closely attuned to our "have and exercise power"formulation in Patrick v. Burget than is the rule adopted by

the Court today. The Court simply does not say just howactive a State's regulators must be before the "active supervision" requirement will be satisfied. The only guidance itgives is that the inquiry should be one akin to causation in
a negligence case; does the State play "a substantial rolein determining the specifics of the economic policy."

Ante,at 635. Any other formulation, we are told, will remove

the active supervision requirement altogether as a practicalmatter.

I do not believe this to be the case.3 In the States at issuehere, the particular conduct was approved by a state agency.
The agency manifested this approval by raising no objectionto a required rate filing by the entity subject to regulation.
This is quite consistent with our statement that the activesupervision requirement serves mainly an "evidentiary function" as "one way of ensuring that the actor is engaging inthe challenged conduct pursuant to state policy."

Hallie v.Eau Claire, 471 U. S. 34, 46 (1985).

The Court insists that its newly required "active supervi-sion" will "increase the States' regulatory flexibility." Ante,
at 636. But if private actors who participate, through ajoint rate filing, in a State's "negative option" regulatory
scheme may be liable for treble damages if they cannot provethat the State approved the specifics of a filing, the Court
makes it highly unlikely that private actors will choose toparticipate in such a joint filing. This in turn

lessens theStates' regulatory flexibility, because as we have noted before, joint rate filings can improve the regulatory processby ensuring that the state agency has fewer filings to consider, allowing more resources to be expended on each filing.

3 The state regulatory programs in Midcal, supra, Patrick v. Burget,
486 U. S. 94 (1988), and 324 Liquor, supra, would all fail to provide immunity for lack of active supervision under the test adopted by the Court
of Appeals.

Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. United
States, supra, at 51. The view advanced by the Court of
Appeals does not sanction price fixing in areas regulated bya State "not inconsistent with the antitrust laws."

Ante, at
636. A State must establish, staff, and fund a program to
approve jointly set rates or prices in order for any activityundertaken by private individuals under that program to be

immune under the antitrust laws.4The Court rejects the test adopted by the Court of Appeals, stating that it cannot be the end of the inquiry. In-stead, the party seeking immunity must "show that state
officials have undertaken the necessary steps to determinethe specifics of the price-fixing or ratesetting scheme."
Ante, at 638.5 Such an inquiry necessarily puts the federalcourt in the position of determining the efficacy of a particular State's regulatory scheme, in order to determine whetherthe State has met the "requisite level of active supervision."
Ante, at 637. The Court maintains that the proper stateaction inquiry does not determine whether a State has met
some "normative standard" in its regulatory practices.
Ante, at 634. But the Court's focus on the actions taken by
state regulators, i. e., the way the State regulates, necessarily requires a judgment as to whether the State is sufficiently
active--surely a normative judgment.

4 In neither of the examples cited by the majority as instances of state
regulation not intended to authorize anticompetitive conduct would application of a less detailed active supervision test change the result. In Patrick v. Burget, supra, we concluded there was no immunity because the
State did not have the authority to review the anticompetitive action undertaken by the peer review committee; in Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co.,
428 U. S. 579 (1976), it is unlikely that the clear articulation requirement
under our current jurisprudence would be met with respect to the market
for light bulbs.

5 It is not clear, from the Court's formulation, whether this is a separate

test applicable only to negative option regulatory schemes, or whether
it applies more generally to issues of immunity under the state-action
doctrine.

646 FTC v. TICOR TITLE INS. CO.

O'Connor, J., dissenting
The Court of Appeals found--properly, in my view--thatwhile the States at issue here did not regulate respondents'

rates with the vigor petitioner would have liked, the States'supervision of respondents' conduct was active enough so as
to provide for immunity from antitrust liability. The Court
of Appeals, having concluded that the Federal Trade Com-mission applied an incorrect legal standard, reviewed the

facts found by the Commission in light of the correct stand-ard and reached a different conclusion. This does not constitute a rejection of the Commission's factual findings.I would therefore affirm the judgment below.

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Thomas joins,dissenting.
Notwithstanding its assertions to the contrary, the Court
has diminished the States' regulatory flexibility by creating
an impossible situation for those subject to state regulation.
Even when a State has a "clearly articulated policy" authorizing anticompetitive behavior--which the Federal Trade
Commission concedes was the case here--and even when the
State establishes a system to supervise the implementation
of that policy, the majority holds that a federal court may
later find that the State's supervision was not sufficiently
"substantial" in its "specifics" to insulate the anticompetitive
behavior from antitrust liability. Ante, at 635. Given the
threat of treble damages, regulated entities that have the
option of heeding the State's anticompetitive policy would be
foolhardy to do so; those that are compelled to comply are
less fortunate. The practical effect of today's decision will
likely be to eliminate so-called "negative option" regulation
from the universe of schemes available to a State that seeks
to regulate without exposing certain conduct to federal antitrust liability.

The Court does not dispute that each of the States at issue
in this case could have supervised respondents' joint ratemaking; rather, it argues that "the potential for state super504us2$87L 04-05-96 17:44:17 PAGES OPINPGT

647Cite as: 504 U. S. 621 (1992)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
vision was not realized in fact." Ante, at 638. Such anafter-the-fact evaluation of a State's exercise of its supervisory powers is extremely unfair to regulated parties. Liabil-ity under the antitrust laws should not turn on how enthusiastically a state official carried out his or her statutory
duties. The regulated entity has no control over the regula-tor, and very likely will have no idea as to the degree of

scrutiny that its filings may receive. Thus, a party couldengage in exactly the same conduct in two States, each of
which had exactly the same policy of allowing anticompeti-tive behavior and exactly the same regulatory structure, and
discover afterward that its actions in one State were immune
from antitrust prosecution, but that its actions in the other
resulted in treble-damages liability.

Moreover, even if a regulated entity could assure itself
that the State will undertake to actively supervise its rate
filings, the majority does not offer any guidance as to what
level of supervision will suffice. It declares only that the
State must "pla[y] a substantial role in determining the specifics of the economic policy." Ante, at 635. That standard
is not only ambiguous, but also runs the risk of being counterproductive. The more reasonable a filed rate, the less
likely that a State will have to play any role other than simply reviewing the rate for compliance with statutory criteria.
Such a vague and retrospective standard, combined with the
threat of treble damages if that standard is not satisfied,
makes "negative option" regulation an unattractive option
for both States and the parties they regulate.

Finally, it is important to remember that antitrust actions
can be brought by private parties as well as by government
prosecutors. The resources of state regulators are strained
enough without adding the extra burden of asking them to
serve as witnesses in civil litigation and respond to allegations that they did not do their job.

For these reasons, as well as those given by The Chief
Justice, I dissent.

BURLINGTON NORTHERN RAILROAD CO. v. FORD

et al.

certiorari to the supreme court of montana

No. 91-779. Argued April 20, 1992--Decided June 12, 1992
Respondents sued petitioner, their employer, under the Federal Employers' Liability Act in the state court in Yellowstone County, Montana.
That court denied petitioner's motions to change venue to Hill County,
where petitioner claimed to have its principal place of business in Montana. The State Supreme Court affirmed, ruling that Montana's venue
rules--which permit a plaintiff to sue a corporation incorporated in that
State only in the county of its principal place of business, but permit suit
in any county against a corporation, like petitioner, that is incorporated
elsewhere--do not work a discrimination violating the Fourteenth
Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.

Held: The distinction in treatment contained in Montana's venue rules

does not offend the Equal Protection Clause. Those rules neither deprive petitioner of a fundamental right nor classify along suspect lines
like race or religion, and are valid because they can be understood as
rationally furthering a legitimate state interest: adjustment of the disparate interests of parties to a lawsuit in the place of trial. Montana
could reasonably determine that only the convenience to a corporate
defendant of litigating in the county of its home office outweighs a plaintiff's interest in suing in the county of his choice. Petitioner has not
shown that the Montana venue rules' hinging on State of incorporation
rather than domicile makes them so underinclusive or overinclusive as
to be irrational. Besides, petitioner, being domiciled outside Montana,
would not benefit from a rule turning on domicile, and therefore cannot
complain of a rule hinging on State of incorporation. Power Manufacturing Co. v. Saunders, 274 U. S. 490, distinguished. Pp. 650-654.

250 Mont. 188, 819 P. 2d 169, affirmed.

Opinion of the Court
Joel I. Klein argued the cause for respondents. With him
on the brief was Robert S. Fain, Jr.*

Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
Montana's venue rules permit a plaintiff to sue a corporation incorporated in that State only in the county of its principal place of business, but permit suit in any county against
a corporation incorporated elsewhere. This case presents
the question whether the distinction in treatment offends
the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,
U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, $ 1. We hold that it does not.

Respondents William D. Ford and Thomas L. Johnson
were employed by petitioner Burlington Northern Railroad
Company, a corporation owing its existence to the laws of
Delaware and having a principal place of business in Fort
Worth, Texas. Ford and Johnson raised a claim under the
Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), 35 Stat. 65, as
amended, 45 U. S. C. $$ 51-60, and brought suit in the state
trial court for Yellowstone County, Montana, alleging injuries sustained while working at Burlington's premises in
Sheridan, Wyoming. In each case, Burlington moved to
change venue to Hill County, Montana, where it claimed to
have its principal place of business in that State. The trial
court denied each motion, and Burlington brought interlocutory appeals.

Legal Foundation by Daniel J. Popeo and Paul D. Kamenar; and for the

650 BURLINGTON NORTHERN R. CO. v. FORD

Opinion of the Court
The Supreme Court of Montana consolidated the two casesand affirmed the decisions of the trial court. 250 Mont. 188,

819 P. 2d 169 (1991). Under the Montana venue rules, thecourt said, a foreign corporation may be sued in any of Montana's counties. Id., at 190, 819 P. 2d, at 171. The courtrejected Burlington's argument that the State's venue rules
worked a discrimination violating the Fourteenth Amend-ment's Equal Protection Clause. The Montana venue rules,
the court explained, were subject merely to rational-basisreview,

id., at 193, 819 P. 2d, at 173, which was satisfied, atleast in these cases, by the consonance of the rules with federal policy, embodied in FELA, of facilitating recovery byinjured railroad workers,

id., at 194-195, 819 P. 2d, at 173-174. Besides, the court said, Montana's venue rules did not

even discriminate against Burlington, since Ford and John-son could have sued the corporation in the Federal District
Court for Montana, which sits in Yellowstone County, amongother places. Id., at 197, 819 P. 2d, at 175. We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 1070 (1992), and, although our reasoningdiffers from that of the State Supreme Court, now affirm.*

A Montana statute provides that "the proper place of trialfor all civil actions is the county in which the defendants or
any of them may reside at the commencement of the action."Mont. Code Ann. $ 25-2-118(1) (1991). But, "if none of the
defendants reside in the state, the proper place of trial is anycounty the plaintiff designates in the complaint." $ 25-2-
118(2). The Supreme Court of Montana has long held that acorporation does not "reside in the state" for venue purposes
unless Montana is its State of incorporation, see, e. g., Haugv. Burlington Northern R. Co., 236 Mont. 368, 371, 770 P. 2d
517, 519 (1989); Foley v. General Motors Corp., 159 Mont.469, 472-473, 499 P. 2d 774, 776 (1972); Hanlon v. Great

*The decision below is final for purposes of 28 U. S. C. $ 1257(a). See

(1926), and that a Montana corporation resides in the Mon-tana county in which it has its principal place of business,

see, e. g., Mapston v. Joint School District No. 8, 227 Mont.521, 523, 740 P. 2d 676, 677 (1987);

Platt v. Sears, Roebuck &
Co., 222 Mont. 184, 187, 721 P. 2d 336, 338 (1986). In combination, these venue rules, with exceptions not here relevant,permit a plaintiff to sue a domestic company in just the one

county where it has its principal place of business, while aplaintiff may sue a foreign corporation in any of the State's
56 counties. Burlington claims the distinction offends theEqual Protection Clause.

The Fourteenth Amendment forbids a State to "deny to
any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the
laws." U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, $ 1. Because the Montana
venue rules neither deprive Burlington of a fundamental
right nor classify along suspect lines like race or religion,
they do not deny equal protection to Burlington unless they
fail in rationally furthering legitimate state ends. See, e. g.,
United States v. Sperry Corp., 493 U. S. 52, 64 (1989); Dallas
v. Stanglin, 490 U. S. 19, 25 (1989).

Venue rules generally reflect equity or expediency in resolving disparate interests of parties to a lawsuit in the place
of trial. See, e. g., Citizens & Southern Nat. Bank v. Bougas, 434 U. S. 35, 44, n. 10 (1977); Denver & R. G. W. R. Co.
v. Trainmen, 387 U. S. 556, 560 (1967); Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U. S. 612, 623 (1964); F. James & G. Hazard, Civil
Procedure 47 (3d ed. 1985). The forum preferable to one
party may be undesirable to another, and the adjustment of
such warring interests is a valid state concern. Cf. United
States Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U. S. 166, 178
(1980). In striking the balance between them, a State may
have a number of choices, any of which would survive scrutiny, each of them passable under the standard tolerating
some play in the joints of governmental machinery. See
Bain Peanut Co. of Texas v. Pinson, 282 U. S. 499, 501 (1931).
Thus, we have no doubt that a State would act within its

504us2$88z 04-05-96 17:46:45 PAGES OPINPGT
652 BURLINGTON NORTHERN R. CO. v. FORD

Opinion of the Court
constitutional prerogatives if it were to give so much weightto the interests of plaintiffs as to allow them to sue in the

counties of their choice under all circumstances. It isequally clear that a State might temper such an "any county"
rule to the extent a reasonable assessment of defendants'
interests so justified.Here, Montana has decided that the any-county rule should

give way to a single-county rule where a defendant residesin Montana, arguably on the reasonable ground that a defendant should not be subjected to a plaintiff 's tactical ad-vantage of forcing a trial far from the defendant's residence.
At the same time, Montana has weighed the interest of a
defendant who does not reside in Montana differently, arguably on the equally reasonable ground that for most nonresident defendants the inconvenience will be great whether
they have to defend in, say, Billings or Havre. See Power
Manufacturing Co. v. Saunders, 274 U. S. 490, 498 (1927)
(Holmes, J., dissenting). Montana could thus have decided
that a nonresident defendant's interest in convenience is too
slight to outweigh the plaintiff 's interest in suing in the
forum of his choice.

Burlington does not, indeed, seriously contend that such
a decision is constitutionally flawed as applied to individual
nonresident defendants. Nor does it argue that such a rule
is unconstitutional even when applied to corporate defendants without a fixed place of business in Montana. Burlington does claim, however, that the rule is unconstitutional as
applied to a corporate defendant like Burlington that not
only has its home office in some other State or country, but
also has a place of business in Montana that would qualify
as its "principal place of business" if it were a Montana
corporation.

Burlington's claim fails. Montana could reasonably have
determined that a corporate defendant's home office is generally of greater significance to the corporation's convenience
in litigation than its other offices, that foreign corporations

653Cite as: 504 U. S. 648 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
are unlikely to have their principal offices in Montana, andthat Montana's domestic corporations will probably keep

headquarters within the State. We cannot say, at least noton this record, that any of these assumptions is irrational.
Cf. G. D. Searle & Co. v. Cohn, 455 U. S. 404, 410 (1982); Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. v. Brownell, 294 U. S. 580, 585(1935). And upon them Montana may have premised the

policy judgment, which we find constitutionally unimpeach-able, that only the convenience to a corporate defendant of
litigating in the county containing its home office is suffi-ciently significant to outweigh a plaintiff 's interest in suing
in the county of his choice.

Of course Montana's venue rules would have implemented
that policy judgment with greater precision if they had
turned on the location of a corporate defendant's principal
place of business, not on its State of incorporation. But this
is hardly enough to make the rules fail rational-basis review,
for "rational distinctions may be made with substantially less
than mathematical exactitude." New Orleans v. Dukes, 427
U. S. 297, 303 (1976); see Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp.,
426 U. S. 794, 814 (1976); Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas
Co., 220 U. S. 61, 78 (1911). Montana may reasonably have
thought that the location of a corporate defendant's principal
place of business would not be as readily verifiable as its
State of incorporation, that a rule hinging on the former
would invite wasteful sideshows of venue litigation, and that
obviating the sideshows would be worth the loss in precision.
These possibilities, of course, put Burlington a far cry away
from the point of discharging its burden of showing that the
underinclusiveness and overinclusiveness of Montana's venue
rules is so great that the rules can no longer be said rationally to implement Montana's policy judgment. See, e. g.,
Brownell, supra, at 584. Besides, Burlington, having headquarters elsewhere, would not benefit even from a scheme
based on domicile, and is therefore in no position to complain
of Montana's using State of incorporation as a surrogate for

domicile. See Roberts & Schaefer Co. v. Emmerson, 271U. S. 50, 53-55 (1926); cf. United States v. Raines, 362 U. S.

17, 21 (1960).Burlington is left with the argument that Power Manufacturing Co. v. Saunders, supra, controls this case. Butit does not. In

Saunders, we considered Arkansas' venuerules, which restricted suit against a domestic corporation to

those counties where it maintained a place of business, 274U. S., at 491-492, but exposed foreign corporations to suit in
any county, id., at 492. We held that the distinction lackeda rational basis and therefore deprived foreign corporate
defendants of the equal protection of the laws. Id., at 494.The statutory provision challenged in

Saunders, however,applied only to foreign corporations authorized to do business in Arkansas, ibid., so that most of the corporations sub-ject to its any-county rule probably had a place of business
in Arkansas. In contrast, most of the corporations subjectto Montana's any-county rule probably do not have their
principal place of business in Montana. Thus, Arkansas'special rule for foreign corporations was tailored with significantly less precision than Montana's, and, on the assump-tion that

Saunders is still good law, see American MotoristsIns. Co. v. Starnes, 425 U. S. 637, 645, n. 6 (1976), its holding

does not invalidate Montana's venue rules.In sum, Montana's venue rules can be understood as rationally furthering a legitimate state interest. The judg-ment of the Supreme Court of Montana is accordingly

Affirmed.

UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 91-712. Argued April 1, 1992--Decided June 15, 1992
Respondent, a citizen and resident of Mexico, was forcibly kidnaped from

his home and flown by private plane to Texas, where he was arrested
for his participation in the kidnaping and murder of a Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) agent and the agent's pilot. After concluding
that DEA agents were responsible for the abduction, the District Court
dismissed the indictment on the ground that it violated the Extradition
Treaty between the United States and Mexico (Extradition Treaty or
Treaty), and ordered respondent's repatriation. The Court of Appeals
affirmed. Based on one of its prior decisions, the court found that, since
the United States had authorized the abduction and since the Mexican Government had protested the Treaty violation, jurisdiction was
improper.

Held: The fact of respondent's forcible abduction does not prohibit his trial

in a United States court for violations of this country's criminal laws.
Pp. 659-670.

(a) A defendant may not be prosecuted in violation of the terms of an
extradition treaty. United States v. Rauscher, 119 U. S. 407. However, when a treaty has not been invoked, a court may properly exercise
jurisdiction even though the defendant's presence is procured by means
of a forcible abduction. Ker v. Illinois, 119 U. S. 436. Thus, if the Extradition Treaty does not prohibit respondent's abduction, the rule of
Ker applies and jurisdiction was proper. Pp. 659-662.

(b) Neither the Treaty's language nor the history of negotiations and
practice under it supports the proposition that it prohibits abductions
outside of its terms. The Treaty says nothing about either country refraining from forcibly abducting people from the other's territory or the
consequences if an abduction occurs. In addition, although the Mexican
Government was made aware of the Ker doctrine as early as 1906, and
language to curtail Ker was drafted as early as 1935, the Treaty's current version contains no such clause. Pp. 663-666.

(c) General principles of international law provide no basis for interpreting the Treaty to include an implied term prohibiting international
abductions. It would go beyond established precedent and practice to
draw such an inference from the Treaty based on respondent's argument
that abductions are so clearly prohibited in international law that there

was no reason to include the prohibition in the Treaty itself. It was
the practice of nations with regard to extradition treaties that formed
the basis for this Court's decision in Rauscher, supra, to imply a term
in the extradition treaty between the United States and England. Respondent's argument, however, would require a much larger inferential
leap with only the most general of international law principles to support it. While respondent may be correct that his abduction was
"shocking" and in violation of general international law principles, the
decision whether he should be returned to Mexico, as a matter outside
the Treaty, is a matter for the Executive Branch. Pp. 666-670.

Opinion of the Court
Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

The issue in this case is whether a criminal defendant, ab-ducted to the United States from a nation with which it has
an extradition treaty, thereby acquires a defense to the juris-diction of this country's courts. We hold that he does not,
and that he may be tried in federal district court for viola-tions of the criminal law of the United States.

Respondent, Humberto Alvarez-Machain, is a citizen andresident of Mexico. He was indicted for participating in the
kidnap and murder of United States Drug Enforcement Ad-ministration (DEA) special agent Enrique Camarena-Salazar
and a Mexican pilot working with Camarena, Alfredo Zavala-Avelar.

1 The DEA believes that respondent, a medical doctor, participated in the murder by prolonging Agent Camare-na's life so that others could further torture and interrogate

him. On April 2, 1990, respondent was forcibly kidnapedfrom his medical office in Guadalajara, Mexico, to be flown
by private plane to El Paso, Texas, where he was arrestedby DEA officials. The District Court concluded that DEA
agents were responsible for respondent's abduction, althoughthey were not personally involved in it. United States v.
Caro-Quintero, 745 F. Supp. 599, 602-604, 609 (CD Cal.1990).

1 Respondent is charged in a sixth superseding indictment with: conspiracy to commit violent acts in furtherance of racketeering activity (in violation of 18 U. S. C. $$ 371, 1959); committing violent acts in furtherance of
racketeering activity (in violation of $ 1959(a)(2)); conspiracy to kidnap a
federal agent (in violation of $$ 1201(a)(5), (c)); kidnap of a federal agent
(in violation of $ 1201(a)(5)); and felony murder of a federal agent (in violation of $$ 1111(a), 1114). App. 12-32.

2 Apparently, DEA officials had attempted to gain respondent's presence

in the United States through informal negotiations with Mexican officials,
but were unsuccessful. DEA officials then, through a contact in Mexico,
offered to pay a reward and expenses in return for the delivery of respondent to the United States. United States v. Caro-Quintero, 745 F. Supp.,

that his abduction constituted outrageous governmental conduct, and that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to try
him because he was abducted in violation of the extradition
treaty between the United States and Mexico. Extradition
Treaty, May 4, 1978, [1979] United States-United Mexican
States, 31 U. S. T. 5059, T. I. A. S. No. 9656 (Extradition
Treaty or Treaty). The District Court rejected the outrageous governmental conduct claim, but held that it lacked
jurisdiction to try respondent because his abduction violated
the Extradition Treaty. The District Court discharged respondent and ordered that he be repatriated to Mexico. 745
F. Supp., at 614.

The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of the indictment and the repatriation of respondent, relying on its decision in United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 939 F. 2d 1341
(CA9 1991), cert. pending, No. 91-670. 946 F. 2d 1466 (1991).
In Verdugo, the Court of Appeals held that the forcible
abduction of a Mexican national with the authorization or
participation of the United States violated the Extradition
Treaty between the United States and Mexico.3 Although
the Treaty does not expressly prohibit such abductions, the
Court of Appeals held that the "purpose" of the Treaty was
violated by a forcible abduction, 939 F. 2d, at 1350, which,
along with a formal protest by the offended nation, would
give a defendant the right to invoke the Treaty violation to
defeat jurisdiction of the District Court to try him.4 The
Court of Appeals further held that the proper remedy for

3 Rene Martin Verdugo-Urquidez was also indicted for the murder of
Agent Camarena. In an earlier decision, we held that the Fourth Amendment did not apply to a search by United States agents of VerdugoUrquidez' home in Mexico. United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U. S.
259 (1990).

4 The Court of Appeals remanded for an evidentiary hearing as to

whether Verdugo's abduction had been authorized by authorities in the
United States. United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 939 F. 2d, at 1362.

Opinion of the Court
such a violation would be dismissal of the indictment andrepatriation of the defendant to Mexico.

In the instant case, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Dis-trict Court's finding that the United States had authorized
the abduction of respondent, and that letters from the Mexi-can Government to the United States Government served as
an official protest of the Treaty violation. Therefore, theCourt of Appeals ordered that the indictment against respondent be dismissed and that respondent be repatriated toMexico. 946 F. 2d, at 1467. We granted certiorari, 502
U. S. 1024 (1992), and now reverse.Although we have never before addressed the precise
issue raised in the present case, we have previously consid-ered proceedings in claimed violation of an extradition treaty
and proceedings against a defendant brought before a courtby means of a forcible abduction. We addressed the former
issue in United States v. Rauscher, 119 U. S. 407 (1886); moreprecisely, the issue whether the Webster-Ashburton Treaty
of 1842, 8 Stat. 576, which governed extraditions betweenEngland and the United States, prohibited the prosecution
of defendant Rauscher for a crime other than the crime forwhich he had been extradited. Whether this prohibition,
known as the doctrine of specialty, was an intended part ofthe treaty had been disputed between the two nations for
some time. Rauscher, 119 U. S., at 411. Justice Miller de-livered the opinion of the Court, which carefully examined
the terms and history of the treaty; the practice of nationsin regards to extradition treaties; the case law from the
States; and the writings of commentators, and reached thefollowing conclusion:

"[A] person who has been brought within the jurisdic-tion of the court by virtue of proceedings under an extradition treaty, can only be tried for one of the offencesdescribed in that treaty, and for the offence with which
he is charged in the proceedings for his extradition, untila reasonable time and opportunity have been given him,

Opinion of the Court
after his release or trial upon such charge, to return tothe country from whose asylum he had been forcibly

taken under those proceedings." Id., at 430 (emphasisadded).

In addition, Justice Miller's opinion noted that any doubt asto this interpretation was put to rest by two federal statutes
which imposed the doctrine of specialty upon extraditiontreaties to which the United States was a party. Id., at 423.

Unlike the case before us today, the defendant in Rauscherhad been brought to the United States by way of an extradition treaty; there was no issue of a forcible abduction.In

Ker v. Illinois, 119 U. S. 436 (1886), also written byJustice Miller and decided the same day as Rauscher, we

addressed the issue of a defendant brought before the courtby way of a forcible abduction. Frederick Ker had been
tried and convicted in an Illinois court for larceny; his pres-ence before the court was procured by means of forcible abduction from Peru. A messenger was sent to Lima with theproper warrant to demand Ker by virtue of the extradition
treaty between Peru and the United States. The messen-ger, however, disdained reliance on the treaty processes, and
instead forcibly kidnaped Ker and brought him to the UnitedStates.

6 We distinguished Ker's case from Rauscher, on the

basis that Ker was not brought into the United States byvirtue of the extradition treaty between the United States

and Peru, and rejected Ker's argument that he had a right

5 Justice Gray, concurring, would have rested the decision on the basis
of these Acts of Congress alone. Rauscher, 119 U. S., at 433. Chief Justice Waite dissented, concluding that the treaty did not forbid trial on a
charge other than that on which extradition was granted, and that the
Acts of Congress did not change the "effect of the treaty." Id., at 436.

6 Although the opinion does not explain why the messenger failed to

present the warrant to the proper authorities, commentators have suggested that the seizure of Ker in the aftermath of a revolution in Peru
provided the messenger with no "proper authorities" to whom the warrant
could be presented. See Kester, Some Myths of United States Extradition Law, 76 Geo. L. J. 1441, 1451 (1988).

under the extradition treaty to be returned to this countryonly in accordance with its terms.

7 We rejected Ker's due

process argument more broadly, holding in line with "thehighest authorities" that "such forcible abduction is no sufficient reason why the party should not answer when broughtwithin the jurisdiction of the court which has the right to
try him for such an offence, and presents no valid objectionto his trial in such court."

Ker, supra, at 444.In Frisbie v. Collins, 342 U. S. 519, rehearing denied, 343

U. S. 937 (1952), we applied the rule in Ker to a case in whichthe defendant had been kidnaped in Chicago by Michigan
officers and brought to trial in Michigan. We upheld theconviction over objections based on the Due Process Clause
and the federal Kidnaping Act and stated:

"This Court has never departed from the rule an-nounced in

[Ker] that the power of a court to try a per-son for crime is not impaired by the fact that he had

been brought within the court's jurisdiction by reason ofa `forcible abduction.' No persuasive reasons are now
presented to justify overruling this line of cases. They
7 In the words of Justice Miller, the "treaty was not called into operation,
was not relied upon, was not made the pretext of arrest, and the facts
show that it was a clear case of kidnapping within the dominions of Peru,
without any pretence of authority under the treaty or from the government of the United States." Ker v. Illinois, 119 U. S., at 443.

Two cases decided during the Prohibition Era in this country have dealt
with seizures claimed to have been in violation of a treaty entered into
between the United States and Great Britain to assist the United States
in offshore enforcement of its prohibition laws, and to allow British passenger ships to carry liquor while in the waters of the United States. 43
Stat. 1761 (1924). The history of the negotiations leading to the treaty is
set forth in Cook v. United States, 288 U. S. 102, 111-118 (1933). In that
case we held that the treaty provision for seizure of British vessels operating beyond the 3-mile limit was intended to be exclusive, and that therefore liquor seized from a British vessel in violation of the treaty could not
form the basis of a conviction.

In Ford v. United States, 273 U. S. 593 (1927), the argument as to personal jurisdiction was deemed to have been waived.

662 UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN

Opinion of the Court
rest on the sound basis that due process of law is satisfied when one present in court is convicted of crime after
having been fairly apprized of the charges against him
and after a fair trial in accordance with constitutional
procedural safeguards. There is nothing in the Constitution that requires a court to permit a guilty person
rightfully convicted to escape justice because he was
brought to trial against his will." Frisbie, supra, at 522
(citation and footnote omitted).8

The only differences between Ker and the present case
are that Ker was decided on the premise that there was no
governmental involvement in the abduction, 119 U. S., at 443;
and Peru, from which Ker was abducted, did not object to
his prosecution.9 Respondent finds these differences to be
dispositive, as did the Court of Appeals in Verdugo, 939 F. 2d,
at 1346, contending that they show that respondent's prosecution, like the prosecution of Rauscher, violates the implied
terms of a valid extradition treaty. The Government, on the
other hand, argues that Rauscher stands as an "exception"
to the rule in Ker only when an extradition treaty is invoked,
and the terms of the treaty provide that its breach will limit
the jurisdiction of a court. Brief for United States 17.
Therefore, our first inquiry must be whether the abduction
of respondent from Mexico violated the Extradition Treaty
between the United States and Mexico. If we conclude that
the Treaty does not prohibit respondent's abduction, the rule
in Ker applies, and the court need not inquire as to how respondent came before it.

8 We have applied Ker to numerous cases where the presence of the
defendant was obtained by an interstate abduction. See, e. g., Mahon v.
Justice, 127 U. S. 700 (1888); Cook v. Hart, 146 U. S. 183 (1892); Pettibone
v. Nichols, 203 U. S. 192, 215-216 (1906).

9 Ker also was not a national of Peru, whereas respondent is a national

of the country from which he was abducted. Respondent finds this difference to be immaterial. Tr. of Oral Arg. 26.

663Cite as: 504 U. S. 655 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
In construing a treaty, as in construing a statute, we first
look to its terms to determine its meaning. Air France v.
Saks, 470 U. S. 392, 397 (1985); Valentine v. United States ex
rel. Neidecker, 299 U. S. 5, 11 (1936). The Treaty says nothing about the obligations of the United States and Mexico to
refrain from forcible abductions of people from the territory
of the other nation, or the consequences under the Treaty if
such an abduction occurs. Respondent submits that Article
22(1) of the Treaty, which states that it "shall apply to offenses specified in Article 2 [including murder] committed
before and after this Treaty enters into force," 31 U. S. T.,
at 5073-5074, evidences an intent to make application of the
Treaty mandatory for those offenses. However, the more
natural conclusion is that Article 22 was included to ensure
that the Treaty was applied to extraditions requested after
the Treaty went into force, regardless of when the crime of
extradition occurred.10

More critical to respondent's argument is Article 9 of the
Treaty, which provides:

"1. Neither Contracting Party shall be bound to deliver
up its own nationals, but the executive authority of the
requested Party shall, if not prevented by the laws of
that Party, have the power to deliver them up if, in its
discretion, it be deemed proper to do so.

"2. If extradition is not granted pursuant to paragraph
1 of this Article, the requested Party shall submit the
case to its competent authorities for the purpose of
prosecution, provided that Party has jurisdiction over
the offense." Id., at 5065.

10 This interpretation is supported by the second clause of Article 22,
which provides that "[r]equests for extradition that are under process on
the date of the entry into force of this Treaty, shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of 22 February, 1899, . . . ." Extradition Treaty, May 4, 1978, [1979] United States-United Mexican States,

664 UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN

Opinion of the Court
According to respondent, Article 9 embodies the terms of the
bargain which the United States struck: If the United States
wishes to prosecute a Mexican national, it may request that
individual's extradition. Upon a request from the United
States, Mexico may either extradite the individual or submit
the case to the proper authorities for prosecution in Mexico.
In this way, respondent reasons, each nation preserved its
right to choose whether its nationals would be tried in its
own courts or by the courts of the other nation. This preservation of rights would be frustrated if either nation were
free to abduct nationals of the other nation for the purposes
of prosecution. More broadly, respondent reasons, as did
the Court of Appeals, that all the processes and restrictions
on the obligation to extradite established by the Treaty
would make no sense if either nation were free to resort to
forcible kidnaping to gain the presence of an individual for
prosecution in a manner not contemplated by the Treaty.
Verdugo, supra, at 1350.

We do not read the Treaty in such a fashion. Article 9
does not purport to specify the only way in which one country may gain custody of a national of the other country for
the purposes of prosecution. In the absence of an extradition treaty, nations are under no obligation to surrender
those in their country to foreign authorities for prosecution.
Rauscher, 119 U. S., at 411-412; Factor v. Laubenheimer, 290
U. S. 276, 287 (1933); cf. Valentine v. United States ex rel.
Neidecker, supra, at 8-9 (United States may not extradite
a citizen in the absence of a statute or treaty obligation).
Extradition treaties exist so as to impose mutual obligations
to surrender individuals in certain defined sets of circumstances, following established procedures. See 1 J. Moore, A
Treatise on Extradition and Interstate Rendition $ 72 (1891).
The Treaty thus provides a mechanism which would not otherwise exist, requiring, under certain circumstances, the
United States and Mexico to extradite individuals to the

Opinion of the Court
other country, and establishing the procedures to be followedwhen the Treaty is invoked.

The history of negotiation and practice under the Treatyalso fails to show that abductions outside of the Treaty constitute a violation of the Treaty. As the Solicitor General
notes, the Mexican Government was made aware, as early as1906, of the

Ker doctrine, and the United States' position
that it applied to forcible abductions made outside of theterms of the United States-Mexico Extradition Treaty.

11

Nonetheless, the current version of the Treaty, signed in1978, does not attempt to establish a rule that would in any

way curtail the effect of Ker.12 Moreover, although lan-guage which would grant individuals exactly the right
sought by respondent had been considered and drafted as

11 In correspondence between the United States and Mexico growing out
of the 1905 Martinez incident, in which a Mexican national was abducted
from Mexico and brought to the United States for trial, the Mexican
Charge' wrote to the Secretary of State protesting that as Martinez' arrest
was made outside of the procedures established in the extradition treaty,
"the action pending against the man can not rest [on] any legal foundation." Letter of Balbino Davalos to Secretary of State, reprinted in Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States, H. R. Doc.
No. 1, 59th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, p. 1121 (1906). The Secretary of State
responded that the exact issue raised by the Martinez incident had been
decided by Ker, and that the remedy open to the Mexican Government,
namely, a request to the United States for extradition of Martinez' abductor, had been granted by the United States. Letter of Robert Bacon to
Mexican Charge', reprinted in Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of
the United States, H. R. Doc. No. 1, supra, at 1121-1122.

Respondent and the Court of Appeals stress a statement made in 1881
by Secretary of State James Blaine to the Governor of Texas to the effect
that the extradition treaty in its form at that time did not authorize unconsented to abductions from Mexico. Verdugo, 939 F. 2d, at 1354; Brief for
Respondent 14. This misses the mark, however, for the Government's
argument is not that the Treaty authorizes the abduction of respondent,
but that the Treaty does not prohibit the abduction.

12 The parties did expressly include the doctrine of specialty in Article

17 of the Treaty, notwithstanding the judicial recognition of it in United
States v. Rauscher, 119 U. S. 407 (1886). 31 U. S. T., at 5071-5072.

504us2$89I 04-08-96 07:14:11 PAGES OPINPGT
666 UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN

Opinion of the Court
early as 1935 by a prominent group of legal scholars sponsored by the faculty of Harvard Law School, no such clause
appears in the current Treaty.13

Thus, the language of the Treaty, in the context of its history, does not support the proposition that the Treaty prohibits abductions outside of its terms. The remaining question, therefore, is whether the Treaty should be interpreted
so as to include an implied term prohibiting prosecution
where the defendant's presence is obtained by means other
than those established by the Treaty. See Valentine, 299
U. S., at 17 ("Strictly the question is not whether there had
been a uniform practical construction denying the power, but
whether the power had been so clearly recognized that the
grant should be implied").

Respondent contends that the Treaty must be interpreted
against the backdrop of customary international law, and
that international abductions are "so clearly prohibited in
international law" that there was no reason to include such
a clause in the Treaty itself. Brief for Respondent 11. The
international censure of international abductions is further
evidenced, according to respondent, by the United Nations
Charter and the Charter of the Organization of American
States. Id., at 17. Respondent does not argue that these
sources of international law provide an independent basis for
the right respondent asserts not to be tried in the United
States, but rather that they should inform the interpretation
of the Treaty terms.

13 In Article 16 of the Draft Convention on Jurisdiction with Respect to
Crime, the Advisory Committee of the Research in International Law
proposed:

"In exercising jurisdiction under this Convention, no State shall prosecute
or punish any person who has been brought within its territory or a place
subject to its authority by recourse to measures in violation of international law or international convention without first obtaining the consent
of the State or States whose rights have been violated by such measures."
Harvard Research in International Law, 29 Am. J. Int'l L. 442 (Supp. 1935).

667Cite as: 504 U. S. 655 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
The Court of Appeals deemed it essential, in order for theindividual defendant to assert a right under the Treaty, that

the affected foreign government had registered a protest.
Verdugo, 939 F. 2d, at 1357 ("[I]n the kidnapping case there
must be a formal protest from the offended government after
the kidnapping"). Respondent agrees that the right exer-cised by the individual is derivative of the nation's right

under the Treaty, since nations are authorized, notwith-standing the terms of an extradition treaty, to voluntarily
render an individual to the other country on terms com-pletely outside of those provided in the treaty. The formal
protest, therefore, ensures that the "offended" nation actually objects to the abduction and has not in some way voluntarily rendered the individual for prosecution. Thus the
Extradition Treaty only prohibits gaining the defendant's
presence by means other than those set forth in the Treaty
when the nation from which the defendant was abducted
objects.

This argument seems to us inconsistent with the remainder of respondent's argument. The Extradition Treaty has
the force of law, and if, as respondent asserts, it is selfexecuting, it would appear that a court must enforce it on
behalf of an individual regardless of the offensiveness of the
practice of one nation to the other nation. In Rauscher, the
Court noted that Great Britain had taken the position in
other cases that the Webster-Ashburton Treaty included the
doctrine of specialty, but no importance was attached to
whether or not Great Britain had protested the prosecution
of Rauscher for the crime of cruel and unusual punishment
as opposed to murder.

More fundamentally, the difficulty with the support respondent garners from international law is that none of it
relates to the practice of nations in relation to extradition
treaties. In Rauscher, we implied a term in the WebsterAshburton Treaty because of the practice of nations with
regard to extradition treaties. In the instant case, respond504us2$89I 04-08-96 07:14:11 PAGES OPINPGT
668 UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ-MACHAIN

Opinion of the Court
ent would imply terms in the Extradition Treaty from the
practice of nations with regards to international law more
generally.14 Respondent would have us find that the Treaty
acts as a prohibition against a violation of the general principle of international law that one government may not "exercise its police power in the territory of another state." Brief
for Respondent 16. There are many actions which could be
taken by a nation that would violate this principle, including
waging war, but it cannot seriously be contended that an
invasion of the United States by Mexico would violate the
terms of the Extradition Treaty between the two nations.15

In sum, to infer from this Treaty and its terms that it
prohibits all means of gaining the presence of an individual

14 Similarly, the Court of Appeals in Verdugo reasoned that international
abductions violate the "purpose" of the Treaty, stating that "[t]he requirements extradition treaties impose constitute a means of safeguarding the
sovereignty of the signatory nations, as well as ensuring the fair treatment
of individuals." 939 F. 2d, at 1350. The ambitious purpose ascribed to
the Treaty by the Court of Appeals, we believe, places a greater burden
on its language and history than they can logically bear. In a broad sense,
most international agreements have the common purpose of safeguarding
the sovereignty of signatory nations, in that they seek to further peaceful
relations between nations. This, however, does not mean that the violation of any principle of international law constitutes a violation of this
particular treaty.

15 In the same category are the examples cited by respondent in which,

after a forcible international abduction, the offended nation protested the
abduction and the abducting nation then returned the individual to the
protesting nation. Brief for Respondent 18, citing, inter alia, 1 Bassiouni,
International Extradition: United States Law and Practice $ 5.4, pp. 235-
237 (2d rev. ed. 1987). These may show the practice of nations under
customary international law, but they are of little aid in construing the
terms of an extradition treaty, or the authority of a court to later try an
individual who has been so abducted. More to the point for our purposes
are cases such as The Richmond, 9 Cranch 102 (1815), and The Merino, 9
Wheat. 391 (1824), both of which hold that a seizure of a vessel in violation
of international law does not affect the jurisdiction of a United States
court to adjudicate rights in connection with the vessel. These cases are
discussed, and distinguished, in Cook v. United States, 288 U. S., at 122.

Opinion of the Court
outside of its terms goes beyond established precedent andpractice. In Rauscher, the implication of a doctrine of

specialty into the terms of the Webster-Ashburton Treaty,which, by its terms, required the presentation of evidence
establishing probable cause of the crime of extradition beforeextradition was required, was a small step to take. By contrast, to imply from the terms of this Treaty that it prohibitsobtaining the presence of an individual by means outside of
the procedures the Treaty establishes requires a much largerinferential leap, with only the most general of international
law principles to support it. The general principles cited byrespondent simply fail to persuade us that we should imply
in the United States-Mexico Extradition Treaty a term pro-hibiting international abductions.

Respondent and his amici may be correct that respond-ent's abduction was "shocking," Tr. of Oral Arg. 40, and that
it may be in violation of general international law principles.Mexico has protested the abduction of respondent through
diplomatic notes, App. 33-38, and the decision of whetherrespondent should be returned to Mexico, as a matter outside
of the Treaty, is a matter for the Executive Branch.16 We

16 The Mexican Government has also requested from the United States
the extradition of two individuals it suspects of having abducted respondent in Mexico, on charges of kidnaping. App. 39-66.

The advantage of the diplomatic approach to the resolution of difficulties
between two sovereign nations, as opposed to unilateral action by the
courts of one nation, is illustrated by the history of the negotiations leading to the treaty discussed in Cook v. United States, supra. The United
States was interested in being able to search British vessels that hovered
beyond the 3-mile limit and served as supply ships for motor launches,
which took intoxicating liquor from them into ports for further distribution in violation of prohibition laws. The United States initially proposed
that both nations agree to searches of the other's vessels beyond the 3-
mile limit; Great Britain rejected such an approach, since it had no prohibition laws and therefore no problem with United States vessels hovering
just beyond its territorial waters. The parties appeared to be at loggerheads; then this Court decided Cunard S. S. Co. v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 100
(1923), holding that our prohibition laws applied to foreign merchant ves504us2$89I 04-08-96 07:14:11 PAGES OPINPGT

Stevens, J., dissenting
conclude, however, that respondent's abduction was not in
violation of the Extradition Treaty between the United
States and Mexico, and therefore the rule of Ker v. Illinois
is fully applicable to this case. The fact of respondent's forcible abduction does not therefore prohibit his trial in a court
in the United States for violations of the criminal laws of the
United States.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

So ordered.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Blackmun and
Justice O'Connor join, dissenting.

The Court correctly observes that this case raises a question of first impression. See ante, at 659. The case is
unique for several reasons. It does not involve an ordinary
abduction by a private kidnaper, or bounty hunter, as in Ker
v. Illinois, 119 U. S. 436 (1886); nor does it involve the apprehension of an American fugitive who committed a crime in
one State and sought asylum in another, as in Frisbie v. Collins, 342 U. S. 519 (1952). Rather, it involves this country's
abduction of another country's citizen; it also involves a violation of the territorial integrity of that other country, with
which this country has signed an extradition treaty.

A Mexican citizen was kidnaped in Mexico and charged
with a crime committed in Mexico; his offense allegedly violated both Mexican and American law. Mexico has formally

sels as well as domestic within the territorial waters of the United States,
and that therefore the carrying of intoxicating liquors by foreign passenger ships violated those laws. A treaty was then successfully negotiated,
giving the United States the right to seizure beyond the 3-mile limit
(which it desired), and giving British passenger ships the right to bring
liquor into United States waters so long as the liquor supply was sealed
while in those waters (which Great Britain desired). Cook v. United
States, supra.

demanded on at least two separate occasions 1 that he be re-turned to Mexico and has represented that he will be prosecuted and, if convicted, punished for his offense.2 It is clearthat Mexico's demand must be honored if this official abduction violated the 1978 Extradition Treaty between theUnited States and Mexico. In my opinion, a fair reading
of the treaty in light of our decision in United States v.

quickly and unequivocally. Tr. of Oral Arg. 33; Brief for Respondent 3.
On April 18, 1990, Mexico requested an official report on the role of the
United States in the abduction, and on May 16, 1990, and July 19, 1990, it
sent diplomatic notes of protest from the Embassy of Mexico to the United
States Department of State. See Brief for United Mexican States as
Amicus Curiae (Mexican Amicus) 5-6; App. to Mexican Amicus 1a-24a.
In the May 16th note, Mexico said that it believed that the abduction was
"carried out with the knowledge of persons working for the U. S. government, in violation of the procedure established in the extradition treaty in
force between the two countries," id., at 5a, and in the July 19th note, it
requested the provisional arrest and extradition of the law enforcement
agents allegedly involved in the abduction. Id., at 9a-15a.

agent. For example, Rafael Caro-Quintero, a co-conspirator of AlvarezMachain in this case, has already been imprisoned in Mexico on a 40-year
sentence. See Brief for Lawyers Committee for Human Rights as Amicus Curiae 4.

against crime and, to this end, to mutually render better
assistance in matters of extradition." 4 From the preamble,

to give the specific words of the treaty a meaning consistent with the
shared expectations of the contracting parties." Air France v. Saks, 470
U. S. 392, 399 (1985). It is difficult to see how an interpretation that encourages unilateral action could foster cooperation and mutual assistance--the stated goals of the Treaty. See also Presidential Letter of
Transmittal attached to Senate Advice and Consent 3 (Treaty would
"make a significant contribution to international cooperation in law
enforcement").

Extradition treaties prevent international conflict by providing agreedupon standards so that the parties may cooperate and avoid retaliatory
invasions of territorial sovereignty. According to one writer, before extradition treaties became common, European states often granted asylum
to fugitives from other states, with the result that "a sovereign could
enforce the return of fugitives only by force of arms . . . . Extradition as
an inducement to peaceful relations and friendly cooperation between
states remained of little practical significance until after World War I."
M. Bassiouni, International Extradition and World Public Order 6 (1974).
This same writer explained that such treaties further the purpose of international law, which is "designed to protect the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of states, and [to] restrict impermissible state conduct." 1
M. Bassiouni, International Extradition: United States Law and Practice,
ch. 5, $ 2, p. 194 (2d rev. ed. 1987).

The object of reducing conflict by promoting cooperation explains why
extradition treaties do not prohibit informal consensual delivery of fugitives, but why they do prohibit state-sponsored abductions. See Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations (Restatement) $ 432, and Comments

cial provisions for political offenses and capital punishment,7and other details, the Treaty appears to have been designed

to cover the entire subject of extradition. Thus, Article 22,entitled "Scope of Application," states that the "Treaty shall
apply to offenses specified in Article 2 committed before andafter this Treaty enters into force," and Article 2 directs
that "[e]xtradition shall take place, subject to this Treaty, forwillful acts which fall within any of [the extraditable offenses
listed in] the clauses of the Appendix." 8 Moreover, as notedby the Court,

ante, at 663, Article 9 expressly provides thatneither contracting party is bound to deliver up its own nationals, although it may do so in its discretion, but if it doesnot do so, it "shall submit the case to its competent authorities for purposes of prosecution." 9The Government's claim that the Treaty is not exclusive,
but permits forcible governmental kidnaping, would trans-form these, and other, provisions into little more than verbiage. For example, provisions requiring "sufficient" evi-dence to grant extradition (Art. 3), withholding extradition
for political or military offenses (Art. 5), withholding extradi-tion when the person sought has already been tried (Art. 6),
withholding extradition when the statute of limitations forthe crime has lapsed (Art. 7), and granting the requested
country discretion to refuse to extradite an individual whowould face the death penalty in the requesting country (Art.
8), would serve little purpose if the requesting country couldsimply kidnap the person. As the Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit recognized in a related case, "[e]ach of theseprovisions would be utterly frustrated if a kidnapping were
held to be a permissible course of governmental conduct."United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 939 F. 2d 1341, 1349

comply with those procedures whenever it wishes to obtainjurisdiction over an individual who is located in another

treaty nation." Id., at 1351.It is true, as the Court notes, that there is no express
promise by either party to refrain from forcible abductions inthe territory of the other nation. See

ante, at 664, 665-666.Relying on that omission,
10 the Court, in effect, concludes

that the Treaty merely creates an optional method of obtain-ing jurisdiction over alleged offenders, and that the parties

silently reserved the right to resort to self-help wheneverthey deem force more expeditious than legal process.

11 If

the United States, for example, thought it more expedient totorture or simply to execute a person rather than to attempt

extradition, these options would be equally available becausethey, too, were not explicitly prohibited by the Treaty.

12

10 The Court resorts to the same method of analysis as did the dissent
in United States v. Rauscher, 119 U. S. 407 (1886). Chief Justice Waite
would only recognize an explicit provision, and in the absence of one, he
concluded that the treaty did not require that a person be tried only for
the offense for which he had been extradited: "The treaty requires a delivery up to justice, on demand, of those accused of certain crimes, but says
nothing about what shall be done with them after the delivery has been
made. It might have provided that they should not be tried for any other
offences than those for which they were surrendered, but it has not." Id.,
at 434. That approach was rejected by the Court in Rauscher and should
also be rejected by the Court here.

11 To make the point more starkly, the Court has, in effect, written into

Article 9 a new provision, which says: "Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and
2 of this Article, either Contracting Party can, without the consent of the
other, abduct nationals from the territory of one Party to be tried in the
territory of the other."

12 It is ironic that the United States has attempted to justify its unilateral action based on the kidnaping, torture, and murder of a federal agent
by authorizing the kidnaping of respondent, for which the American law
enforcement agents who participated have now been charged by Mexico.
See App. to Mexican Amicus 5a. This goes to my earlier point, see n. 4,
supra, that extradition treaties promote harmonious relations by providing for the orderly surrender of a person by one state to another, and
without such treaties, resort to force often followed.

That, however, is a highly improbable interpretation of aconsensual agreement,

13 which on its face appears to have

been intended to set forth comprehensive and exclusive rulesconcerning the subject of extradition.

14 In my opinion, "the

manifest scope and object of the treaty itself," Rauscher, 119U. S., at 422, plainly imply a mutual undertaking to respect

the territorial integrity of the other contracting party. Thatopinion is confirmed by a consideration of the "legal context"
in which the Treaty was negotiated.15 Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 699 (1979).

II
In Rauscher, the Court construed an extradition treatythat was far less comprehensive than the 1978 Treaty with

Mexico. The 1842 treaty with Great Britain determined theboundary between the United States and Canada, provided
for the suppression of the African slave trade, and also con13 This Court has previously described a treaty as generally "in its nature a contract between two nations," Foster v. Neilson, 2 Pet. 253, 314

the land. 2 Pet., at 314; 119 U. S., at 418-419.

14 Mexico's understanding is that "[t]he extradition treaty governs comprehensively the delivery of all persons for trial in the requesting state
`for an offense committed outside the territory of the requesting Party.' "
Brief for United Mexican States as Amicus Curiae, O. T. 1991, No. 91-670,
p. 6. And Canada, with whom the United States also shares a large border and with whom the United States also has an extradition treaty, understands the treaty to be "the exclusive means for a requesting government to obtain . . . a removal" of a person from its territory, unless a
nation otherwise gives its consent. Brief for Government of Canada as

tained one paragraph authorizing the extradition of fugitives
"in certain cases." 8 Stat. 576. In Article X, each nation
agreed to "deliver up to justice all persons" properly charged
with any one of seven specific crimes, including murder. 119
U. S., at 421.16 After Rauscher had been extradited for murder, he was charged with the lesser offense of inflicting cruel
and unusual punishment on a member of the crew of a vessel
on the high seas. Although the treaty did not purport to
place any limit on the jurisdiction of the demanding state
after acquiring custody of the fugitive, this Court held that
he could not be tried for any offense other than murder.17
Thus, the treaty constituted the exclusive means by which

16 Article X of the Treaty provided:
"It is agreed that the United States and Her Britannic Majesty shall,
upon mutual requisitions by them, or their ministers, officers, or authorities, respectively made, deliver up to justice all persons who, being
charged with the crime of murder, or assault with intent to commit murder, or piracy, or arson, or robbery, or forgery, or the utterance of forged
paper, committed within the jurisdiction of either, shall seek an asylum,
or shall be found, within the territories of the other: provided that this
shall only be done upon such evidence of criminality as, according to the
laws of the place where the fugitive or person so charged shall be found,
would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial, if the crime or
offence had there been committed: and the respective judges and other
magistrates of the two Governments shall have power, jurisdiction, and
authority, upon complaint made under oath, to issue a warrant for the
apprehension of the fugitive or person so charged, that he may be brought
before such judges or other magistrates, respectively, to the end that the
evidence of criminality may be heard and considered; and if, on such hearing, the evidence be deemed sufficient to sustain the charge, it shall be the
duty of the examining judge or magistrate to certify the same to the
proper Executive authority, that a warrant may issue for the surrender of
such fugitive. The expense of such apprehension and delivery shall be
borne and defrayed by the party who makes the requisition, and receives
the fugitive." 8 Stat. 576.

17 The doctrine defined by the Court in Rauscher--that a person can be

tried only for the crime for which he had been extradited--has come to be
known as the "doctrine of specialty."

the United States could obtain jurisdiction over a defendantwithin the territorial jurisdiction of Great Britain.

The Court noted that the treaty included several specificprovisions, such as the crimes for which one could be extradited, the process by which the extradition was to be carriedout, and even the evidence that was to be produced, and concluded that "the fair purpose of the treaty is, that the personshall be delivered up to be tried for that offence and for no
other." Id., at 423. The Court reasoned that it did notmake sense for the treaty to provide such specifics only to
have the person "pas[s] into the hands of the country whichcharges him with the offence, free from all the positive requirements and just implications of the treaty under whichthe transfer of his person takes place." Id., at 421. To interpret the treaty in a contrary way would mean that a coun-try could request extradition of a person for one of the seven
crimes covered by the treaty, and then try the person foranother crime, such as a political crime, which was clearly
not covered by the treaty; this result, the Court concluded,was clearly contrary to the intent of the parties and the purpose of the treaty.Rejecting an argument that the sole purpose of Article X
was to provide a procedure for the transfer of an individualfrom the jurisdiction of one sovereign to another, the Court
stated:

"No such view of solemn public treaties between thegreat nations of the earth can be sustained by a tribunal

called upon to give judicial construction to them."The opposite view has been attempted to be maintained in this country upon the ground that there is noexpress limitation in the treaty of the right of the country in which the offence was committed to try the personfor the crime alone for which he was extradited, and that
once being within the jurisdiction of that country, nomatter by what contrivance or fraud or by what pretence of establishing a charge provided for by the extra504us2$89I 04-08-96 07:14:12 PAGES OPINPGT

dition treaty he may have been brought within the ju-risdiction, he is, when here, liable to be tried for any

offence against the laws as though arrested here origi-nally. This proposition of the absence of express restriction in the treaty of the right to try him for otheroffences than that for which he was extradited, is met
by the manifest scope and object of the treaty itself."
Id., at 422.

Thus, the Extradition Treaty, as understood in the contextof cases that have addressed similar issues, suffices to protect the defendant from prosecution despite the absence ofany express language in the Treaty itself purporting to limit
this Nation's power to prosecute a defendant over whom ithad lawfully acquired jurisdiction.

18

Although the Court's conclusion in Rauscher was sup-ported by a number of judicial precedents, the holdings in

these cases were not nearly as uniform 19 as the consensusof international opinion that condemns one nation's violation
of the territorial integrity of a friendly neighbor.20 It is

18 In its opinion, the Court suggests that the result in Rauscher was
dictated by the fact that two federal statutes had imposed the doctrine of
specialty upon extradition treaties. Ante, at 660. The two cited statutes, however, do not contain any language purporting to limit the jurisdiction of the court; rather, they merely provide for protection of the accused pending trial.

19 In fact, both parties noted in their respective briefs several authorities

that had held that a person could be tried for an offense other than the
one for which he had been extradited. See Brief for United States in
United States v. Rauscher, O. T. 1885, No. 1249, pp. 6-10 (citing United
States v. Caldwell, 8 Blatchford 131 (SDNY 1871); United States v. Lawrence, 13 Blatchford 295 (SDNY 1876); Adriance v. Lagrave, 59 N. Y. 110

shocking that a party to an extradition treaty might believethat it has secretly reserved the right to make seizures of

citizens in the other party's territory.21 Justice Story foundit shocking enough that the United States would attempt to
justify an American seizure of a foreign vessel in a Spanishport:

"But, even supposing, for a moment, that our laws hadrequired an entry of The Apollon, in her transit, does
it follow that the power to arrest her was meant to begiven, after she had passed into the exclusive territory
of a foreign nation? We think not. It would be monstrous to suppose that our revenue officers were author-ized to enter into foreign ports and territories, for the

purpose of seizing vessels which had offended againstour laws. It cannot be presumed that congress would
voluntarily justify such a clear violation of the laws ofnations."

Law, in International Law at a Time of Perplexity 407 (Y. Dinstein & M.
Tabory eds. 1989).

21 When Abraham Sofaer, Legal Adviser of the State Department, was

questioned at a congressional hearing, he resisted the notion that such
seizures were acceptable: " `Can you imagine us going into Paris and seizing some person we regard as a terrorist . . . ? [H]ow would we feel if
some foreign nation--let us take the United Kingdom--came over here
and seized some terrorist suspect in New York City, or Boston, or Philadelphia, . . . because we refused through the normal channels of international, legal communications, to extradite that individual?' " Bill To

where our jurisdiction is complete, to our own waters, or to the ocean,

"It is . . . a breach of International Law for a State tosend its agents to the territory of another State to apprehend persons accused of having committed a crime.Apart from other satisfaction, the first duty of the offending State is to hand over the person in question tothe State in whose territory he was apprehended." 1

23

Commenting on the precise issue raised by this case, thechief reporter for the American Law Institute's Restatement
of Foreign Relations used language reminiscent of JusticeStory's characterization of an official seizure in a foreign jurisdiction as "monstrous":
jurisdiction, which is distinct from the ordinary maritime jurisdiction over
waters within the range of a common shot from our shores. And the
provisions in the Collection Act of 1799, which authorize a visitation of
vessels within four leagues of our coasts, are referred to in proof of the
assertion. But where is that right of visitation to be exercised? In a
foreign territory, in the exclusive jurisdiction of another sovereign? Certainly not; for the very terms of the act confine it to the ocean, where all
nations have a common right, and exercise a common sovereignty. And
over what vessels is this right of visitation to be exercised? By the very
words of the act, over our own vessels, and over foreign vessels bound to
our ports, and over no others. To have gone beyond this, would have
been an usurpation of exclusive sovereignty on the ocean, and an exercise
of an universal right of search, a right which has never yet been acknowledged by other nations, and would be resisted by none with more pertinacity than by the American." The Apollon, 9 Wheat., at 371-372.

23 See Restatement $ 432, Comment c ("If the unauthorized action includes abduction of a person, the state from which the person was abducted may demand return of the person, and international law requires
that he be returned").

"When done without consent of the foreign govern-ment, abducting a person from a foreign country is a

gross violation of international law and gross disrespectfor a norm high in the opinion of mankind. It is a
blatant violation of the territorial integrity of anotherstate; it eviscerates the extradition system (established
by a comprehensive network of treaties involving virtu-ally all states)."

24

In the Rauscher case, the legal background that supportedthe decision to imply a covenant not to prosecute for an offense different from that for which extradition had beengranted was far less clear than the rule against invading the
territorial integrity of a treaty partner that supports Mexi-co's position in this case.

25 If Rauscher was correctly decided--and I am convinced that it was--its rationale clearlydictates a comparable result in this case.

26

24 Henkin, A Decent Respect to the Opinions of Mankind, 25 John Marshall L. Rev. 215, 231 (1992) (footnote omitted).

25 Thus, the Restatement states in part:

"(2) A state's law enforcement officers may exercise their functions in
the territory of another state only with the consent of the other state,
given by duly authorized officials of that state.. . . . .

"c. Consequences of violation of territorial limits of law enforcement.
If a state's law enforcement officials exercise their functions in the territory of another state without the latter's consent, that state is entitled to
protest and, in appropriate cases, to receive reparation from the offending
state. If the unauthorized action includes abduction of a person, the state
from which the person was abducted may demand return of the person,
and international law requires that he be returned. If the state from
which the person was abducted does not demand his return, under the
prevailing view the abducting state may proceed to prosecute him under
its laws." $ 432, and Comment c.

26 Just as Rauscher had standing to raise the treaty violation issue, respondent may raise a comparable issue in this case. Certainly, if an individual who is not a party to an agreement between the United States and
another country is permitted to assert the rights of that country in our
courts, as is true in the specialty cases, then the same rule must apply to

A critical flaw pervades the Court's entire opinion. Itfails to differentiate between the conduct of private citizens,

which does not violate any treaty obligation, and conductexpressly authorized by the Executive Branch of the Government, which unquestionably constitutes a flagrant viola-tion of international law,

27 and in my opinion, also constitutes

a breach of our treaty obligations. Thus, at the outset of its
opinion, the Court states the issue as "whether a criminaldefendant, abducted to the United States from a nation with

which it has an extradition treaty, thereby acquires a defense
to the jurisdiction of this country's courts." Ante, at 657.That, of course, is the question decided in

Ker v. Illinois, 119
U. S. 436 (1886); it is not, however, the question presentedfor decision today.

The importance of the distinction between a court's exer-cise of jurisdiction over either a person or property that has
been wrongfully seized by a private citizen, or even by astate law enforcement agent, on the one hand, and the attempted exercise of jurisdiction predicated on a seizure by
federal officers acting beyond the authority conferred bytreaty, on the other hand, is explained by Justice Brandeis in

his opinion for the Court in Cook v. United States, 288 U. S.102 (1933). That case involved a construction of a Prohibition Era treaty with Great Britain that authorized Americanagents to board certain British vessels to ascertain whether
they were engaged in importing alcoholic beverages. A
the individual who has been a victim of this country's breach of an extradition treaty and who wishes to assert the rights of that country in our
courts after that country has already registered its protest.

27 "In the international legal order, treaties are concluded by states

against a background of customary international law. Norms of customary international law specify the circumstances in which the failure of one
party to fulfill its treaty obligations will permit the other to rescind the
treaty, retaliate, or take other steps." Va'zquez, Treaty-Based Rights and
Remedies of Individuals, 92 Colum. L. Rev. 1082, 1157 (1992).

British vessel was boarded 111/2 miles off the coast of Massa-chusetts, found to be carrying unmanifested alcoholic beverages, and taken into port. The Collector of Customs as-sessed a penalty which he attempted to collect by means of
libels against both the cargo and the seized vessel.The Court held that the seizure was not authorized by the
treaty because it occurred more than 10 miles off shore.28The Government argued that the illegality of the seizure was
immaterial because, as in Ker, the court's jurisdiction wassupported by possession even if the seizure was wrongful.
Justice Brandeis acknowledged that the argument would suc-ceed if the seizure had been made by a private party without
authority to act for the Government, but that a different ruleprevails when the Government itself lacks the power to seize.
Relying on Rauscher, and distinguishing Ker, he explained:

"Fourth. As the Mazel Tov was seized without war-rant of law, the libels were properly dismissed. The

Government contends that the alleged illegality of theseizure is immaterial. It argues that the facts proved
show a violation of our law for which the penalty of for-feiture is prescribed; that the United States may, by filing a libel for forfeiture, ratify what otherwise wouldhave been an illegal seizure; that the seized vessel having been brought into the Port of Providence, the federalcourt for Rhode Island acquired jurisdiction; and that,
moreover, the claimant by answering to the meritswaived any right to object to enforcement of the penalties. The argument rests upon misconceptions."It is true that where the United States, having possession of property, files a libel to enforce a forfeitureresulting from a violation of its laws, the fact that the
possession was acquired by a wrongful act is immaterial.
28 The treaty provided that the boarding rights could not be exercised
at a greater distance from the coast than the vessel could traverse in one
hour, and the seized vessel's speed did not exceed 10 miles an hour. Cook

Taylor v. United States, 3 How. 197, 205-206[(1845)]. The doctrine is not applicable here. The objection to the seizure is not that it was wrongful merelybecause made by one upon whom the Government had
not conferred authority to seize at the place where theseizure was made. The objection is that the Government itself lacked power to seize, since by the Treaty ithad imposed a territorial limitation upon its own authority. The Treaty fixes the conditions under which a `ves-sel may be seized and taken into a port of the United
States, its territories or possessions for adjudication inaccordance with' the applicable laws. Thereby, Great
Britain agreed that adjudication may follow a right-ful seizure. Our Government, lacking power to seize,
lacked power, because of the Treaty, to subject the ves-sel to our laws. To hold that adjudication may follow
a wrongful seizure would go far to nullify the purposeand effect of the Treaty. Compare

United States v.Rauscher, 119 U. S. 407." Cook v. United States, 288

U. S., at 120-122.
The same reasoning was employed by Justice Miller to ex-plain why the holding in

Rauscher did not apply to the Kercase. The arresting officer in Ker did not pretend to be acting in any official capacity when he kidnaped Ker. As Jus-tice Miller noted, "the facts show that it was a clear case of
kidnapping within the dominions of Peru, without any pre-tence of authority under the treaty or from the government

29 The exact opposite is true in this case, as

it was in Cook.30The Court's failure to differentiate between private abductions and official invasions of another sovereign's territoryalso accounts for its misplaced reliance on the 1935 proposal
made by the Advisory Committee on Research in Interna-tional Law. See

ante, at 665-666, and n. 13. As the text ofthat proposal plainly states, it would have rejected the rule

of the Ker case.31 The failure to adopt that recommendationdoes not speak to the issue the Court decides today. The

29 As the Illinois Supreme Court described the action:
"The arrest and detention of [Ker] was not by any authority of the general
government, and no obligation is implied on the part of the Federal or any
State government . . . . The invasion of the sovereignty of Peru, if any
wrong was done, was by individuals, perhaps some of them owing no allegiance to the United States, and not by the Federal government." Ker v.
Illinois, 110 Ill. 627, 643 (1884).

30 The Martinez incident discussed by the Court, see ante, at 665, n. 11,

also involved an abduction by a private party; the reference to the Ker
precedent was therefore appropriate in that case. On the other hand, the
letter written by Secretary of State Blaine to the Governor of Texas in
1881 unequivocally disapproved of abductions by either party to an extradition treaty. In 1984, Secretary of State Schultz expressed the same
opinion about an authorized kidnaping of a Canadian national. He remarked that, in view of the extradition treaty between the United States
and Canada, it was understandable that Canada was "outraged" by the
kidnaping and considered it to be "a violation of the treaty and of international law, as well as an affront to its sovereignty." See Leich, Contemporary Practice of the United States Relating to International Law, 78 Am.
J. Int'l L. 200, 208 (1984).

31 Article 16 of the draft provides:

"In exercising jurisdiction under this Convention, no State shall prosecute or punish any person who has been brought within its territory or
a place subject to its authority by recourse to measures in violation of
international law or international convention without first obtaining the
consent of the State or States whose rights have been violated by such
measures." Harvard Research in International Law, Draft Convention

Court's admittedly "shocking" disdain for customary andconventional international law principles, see ante, at 669, is

thus entirely unsupported by case law and commentary.

IV
As the Court observes at the outset of its opinion, there isreason to believe that respondent participated in an especially brutal murder of an American law enforcement agent.That fact, if true, may explain the Executive's intense interest in punishing respondent in our courts.32 Such an expla-nation, however, provides no justification for disregarding
the Rule of Law that this Court has a duty to uphold.33That the Executive may wish to reinterpret

33 As Justice Brandeis so wisely urged:

"In a government of laws, existence of the government will be imperilled
if it fails to observe the law scrupulously. Our Government is the potent,
the omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people
by its example. Crime is contagious. If the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law
unto himself; it invites anarchy. To declare that in the administration of
the criminal law the end justifies the means--to declare that the Government may commit crimes in order to secure the conviction of a private
criminal--would bring terrible retribution. Against that pernicious
doctrine this Court should resolutely set its face." Olmstead v. United
States, 277 U. S. 438, 485 (1928) (dissenting opinion).

34 Certainly, the Executive's view has changed over time. At one point,

the Office of Legal Counsel advised the administration that such seizures
were contrary to international law because they compromised the territorial integrity of the other nation and were only to be undertaken with the
consent of that nation. 4B Op. Off. Legal Counsel 549, 556 (1980). More
recently, that opinion was revised, and the new opinion concluded that the
President did have the authority to override customary international law.

allow for an action that the Treaty in no way authorizes
should not influence this Court's interpretation.35 Indeed,
the desire for revenge exerts "a kind of hydraulic pressure
. . . before which even well settled principles of law will
bend," Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U. S.
197, 401 (1904) (Holmes, J., dissenting), but it is precisely at
such moments that we should remember and be guided by
our duty "to render judgment evenly and dispassionately according to law, as each is given understanding to ascertain
and apply it." United States v. Mine Workers, 330 U. S. 258,
342 (1947) (Rutledge, J., dissenting). The way that we perform that duty in a case of this kind sets an example that
other tribunals in other countries are sure to emulate.

The significance of this Court's precedents is illustrated by
a recent decision of the Court of Appeal of the Republic of
South Africa. Based largely on its understanding of the import of this Court's cases--including our decision in Ker--
that court held that the prosecution of a defendant kidnaped
by agents of South Africa in another country must be dismissed. S v. Ebrahim, S. Afr. L. Rep. (Apr.- June 1991).36
The Court of Appeal of South Africa--indeed, I suspect most
courts throughout the civilized world--will be deeply disturbed by the "monstrous" decision the Court announces
today. For every nation that has an interest in preserving
the Rule of Law is affected, directly or indirectly, by a deci35 Cf. Perkins v. Elg, 307 U. S. 325 (1939) (construing treaty in accordance with historical construction and refusing to defer to change in Executive policy); Johnson v. Browne, 205 U. S. 309 (1907) (rejecting Executive's interpretation).

36 The South African court agreed with appellant that an "abduction represents a violation of the applicable rules of international law, that these
rules are part of [South African] law, and that this violation of the law
deprives the Court . . . of its competence to hear [appellant's] case . . . ."

a nation "to stretch, to misinterpret, and to misapply eventhe best of laws."

duty he establishes a precedent that will reach tohimself."

ANKENBRANDT, as next friend and mother ofL. R.,

et al. v. RICHARDS et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 91-367. Argued March 31, 1992--Decided June 15, 1992
Petitioner brought this suit on behalf of her daughters in the District

Court, alleging federal jurisdiction based on the diversity-of-citizenship
provision of 28 U. S. C. $ 1332, and seeking monetary damages for alleged torts committed against the girls by their father and his female
companion, the respondents here. The court granted respondents' motion to dismiss without prejudice, ruling in the alternative that it lacked
jurisdiction because the case fell within the "domestic relations" exception to diversity jurisdiction and that its decision to dismiss was justified
under the abstention principles announced in Younger v. Harris, 401
U. S. 37. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held:

1. A domestic relations exception to federal diversity jurisdiction
exists as a matter of statutory construction. Pp. 693-701.

(a) The exception stems from Barber v. Barber, 21 How. 582, 584,
in which the Court announced in dicta, without citation of authority or
discussion of foundation, that federal courts have no jurisdiction over
suits for divorce or the allowance of alimony. The lower federal courts
have ever since recognized a limitation on their jurisdiction based on
that statement, and this Court is unwilling to cast aside an understood
rule that has existed for nearly a century and a half. Pp. 693-695.

(b) An examination of Article III, $ 2, of the Constitution and of
Barber and its progeny makes clear that the Constitution does not mandate the exclusion of domestic relations cases from federal-court jurisdiction. Rather, the origins of the exception lie in the statutory requirements for diversity jurisdiction. De la Rama v. De la Rama, 201
U. S. 303, 307. Pp. 695-697.

(c) That the domestic relations exception exists is demonstrated by
the inclusion of the defining phrase, "all suits of a civil nature at common
law or in equity," in the pre-1948 versions of the diversity statute, by
Barber's implicit interpretation of that phrase to exclude divorce and
alimony actions, and by Congress' silent acceptance of this construction
for nearly a century. Considerations of stare decisis have particular
strength in this context, where the legislative power is implicated, and
Congress remains free to alter what this Court has done. Patterson v.

690 ANKENBRANDT v. RICHARDS

Syllabus
McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172-173. Furthermore, it may be
presumed that Congress amended the diversity statute in 1948 to replace the law/equity distinction with $ 1332's "all civil actions" phrase
with full cognizance of the Court's longstanding interpretation of the
prior statutes, and that, absent any indication of an intent to the contrary, Congress adopted that interpretation in reenacting the statute.
Pp. 697-701.

2. The domestic relations exception does not permit a district court
to refuse to exercise diversity jurisdiction over a tort action for damages. The exception, as articulated by this Court since Barber, encompasses only cases involving the issuance of a divorce, alimony, or child
custody decree. As so limited, the exception's validity must be reaffirmed, given the long passage of time without any expression of congressional dissatisfaction and sound policy considerations of judicial
economy and expertise. Because this lawsuit in no way seeks a divorce,
alimony, or child custody decree, the Court of Appeals erred by affirming the District Court's invocation of the domestic relations exception.
Federal subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to $ 1332 is proper in this
case. Pp. 701-704.

3. The District Court erred in abstaining from exercising jurisdiction under the Younger doctrine. Although this Court has extended
Younger abstention to the civil context, it has never applied the notions
of comity so critical to Younger where, as here, no proceeding was pending in state tribunals. Similarly, while it is not inconceivable that in
certain circumstances the abstention principles developed in Burford v.
Sun Oil Co., 319 U. S. 315, might be relevant in a case involving elements of the domestic relationship even when the parties do not seek
divorce, alimony, or child custody, such abstention is inappropriate here,
where the status of the domestic relationship has been determined as a
matter of state law, and in any event has no bearing on the underlying
torts alleged. Pp. 704-706.

Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the issue whether the federal courtshave jurisdiction or should abstain in a case involving alleged

torts committed by the former husband of petitioner andhis female companion against petitioner's children, when
the sole basis for federal jurisdiction is the diversity-of-citizenship provision of 28 U. S. C. $ 1332.

I
Petitioner Carol Ankenbrandt, a citizen of Missouri,brought this lawsuit on September 26, 1989, on behalf of her

daughters L. R. and S. R. against respondents Jon A. Rich-ards and Debra Kesler, citizens of Louisiana, in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.Alleging federal jurisdiction based on the diversity-ofcitizenship provision of $ 1332, Ankenbrandt's complaintsought monetary damages for alleged sexual and physical
abuse of the children committed by Richards and Kesler.Richards is the divorced father of the children and Kesler
his female companion.1 On December 10, 1990, the DistrictCourt granted respondents' motion to dismiss this lawsuit.

*Marcia Robinson Lowry, Steven R. Shapiro, and John A. Powell filed
a brief for the American Civil Liberties Union as amicus curiae urging
reversal.

federal-court action, on August 9, 1989, a juvenile court in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, entered a judgment under the State's child protection laws,

Code, Title X, Art. 1001 et seq. (1991), permanently terminating all of
Richards' parental rights because of the alleged abuse and permanently
enjoining him from any contact with the children. Neither the District
Court nor the Court of Appeals found it necessary to pass on the accuracy
of this representation in resolving the issues presented; nor do we.

Opinion of the Court
Citing In re Burrus, 136 U. S. 586, 593-594 (1890), for theproposition that "[t]he whole subject of the domestic relations of husband and wife, parent and child, belongs to thelaws of the States and not to the laws of the United States,"
the court concluded that this case fell within what has become known as the "domestic relations" exception to diver-sity jurisdiction, and that it lacked jurisdiction over the case.

The court also invoked the abstention principles announcedin

Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971), to justify its decision to dismiss the complaint without prejudice. No. 89-4244 (ED La., Dec. 10, 1990). The Court of Appeals affirmed

from exercising diversity jurisdiction over a tort action for
damages?" 2 and "(3) Did the District Court in this case err

2 The Courts of Appeals have generally diverged in cases involving
application of the domestic relations exception to tort suits brought in
federal court pursuant to diversity jurisdiction. See, e. g., Bennett v.
Bennett, 221 U. S. App. D. C. 90, 682 F. 2d 1039 (1982) (holding that the
exception does not bar a claim for damages but that it does bar claims for
injunctive relief); Cole v. Cole, 633 F. 2d 1083 (CA4 1980) (holding that the
exception does not apply in tort suits stemming from custody and visitation disputes); Drewes v. Ilnicki, 863 F. 2d 469 (CA6 1988) (holding that the
exception does not apply to a tort suit for intentional infliction of emotional
distress); Lloyd v. Loeffler, 694 F. 2d 489 (CA7 1982) (holding that the
exception does not apply to a tort claim for interference with the custody
of a child); McIntyre v. McIntyre, 771 F. 2d 1316 (CA9 1985) (holding that
the exception does not apply when the case does not involve questions of
parental status, interference with pending state domestic relations proceedings, an alteration of a state-court judgment, or the impingement of
the state court's supervision of a minor); Ingram v. Hayes, 866 F. 2d 368
(CA11 1988) (holding that the exception applies to divest a federal court
of jurisdiction over a tort action for intentional infliction of emotional
distress).

of Younger v. Harris?" 502 U. S. 1023 (1992). We addresseach of these issues in turn.

II
The domestic relations exception upon which the courtsbelow relied to decline jurisdiction has been invoked often

by the lower federal courts. The seeming authority fordoing so originally stemmed from the announcement in Barber v. Barber, 21 How. 582 (1859), that the federal courtshave no jurisdiction over suits for divorce or the allowance
of alimony. In that case, the Court heard a suit in equitybrought by a wife (by her next friend) in Federal District
Court pursuant to diversity jurisdiction against her formerhusband. She sought to enforce a decree from a New York
state court, which had granted a divorce and awarded heralimony. The former husband thereupon moved to Wisconsin to place himself beyond the New York courts' jurisdictionso that the divorce decree there could not be enforced
against him; he then sued for divorce in a Wisconsin court,representing to that court that his wife had abandoned him
and failing to disclose the existence of the New York decree.In a suit brought by the former wife in Wisconsin Federal
District Court, the former husband alleged that the courtlacked jurisdiction. The court accepted jurisdiction and
gave judgment for the divorced wife.On appeal, it was argued that the District Court lacked
jurisdiction on two grounds: first, that there was no diversityof citizenship because although divorced, the wife's citizenship necessarily remained that of her former husband; andsecond, that the whole subject of divorce and alimony, including a suit to enforce an alimony decree, was exclusively eccle-siastical at the time of the adoption of the Constitution and
that the Constitution therefore placed the whole subject ofdivorce and alimony beyond the jurisdiction of the United
States courts. Over the dissent of three Justices, the Courtrejected both arguments. After an exhaustive survey of

504us2$90F 04-05-96 19:35:56 PAGES OPINPGT
694 ANKENBRANDT v. RICHARDS

Opinion of the Court
the authorities, the Court concluded that a divorced wifecould acquire a citizenship separate from that of her former

husband and that a suit to enforce an alimony decree restedwithin the federal courts' equity jurisdiction. The Court
reached these conclusions after summarily dismissing the
former husband's contention that the case involved a subjectmatter outside the federal courts' jurisdiction. In so stating, however, the Court also announced the following limita-tion on federal jurisdiction:

"Our first remark is--and we wish it to be remembered--that this is not a suit asking the court for the
allowance of alimony. That has been done by a courtof competent jurisdiction. The court in Wisconsin was

asked to interfere to prevent that decree from beingdefeated by fraud.

"We disclaim altogether any jurisdiction in the courtsof the United States upon the subject of divorce, or for
the allowance of alimony, either as an original proceeding in chancery or as an incident to divorce a vinculo,or to one from bed and board."

Barber, supra, at 584.

As a general matter, the dissenters agreed with these statements, but took issue with the Court's holding that the in-stant action to enforce an alimony decree was within the

equity jurisdiction of the federal courts.

The statements disclaiming jurisdiction over divorce andalimony decree suits, though technically dicta, formed the

basis for excluding "domestic relations" cases from the juris-diction of the lower federal courts, a jurisdictional limitation
those courts have recognized ever since. The Barber Court,
however, cited no authority and did not discuss the foundation for its announcement. Since that time, the Court has
dealt only occasionally with the domestic relations limitation
on federal-court jurisdiction, and it has never addressed the
basis for such a limitation. Because we are unwilling to cast
aside an understood rule that has been recognized for nearly

695Cite as: 504 U. S. 689 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
a century and a half, we feel compelled to explain whywe will continue to recognize this limitation on federal

jurisdiction. A

Counsel argued in Barber that the Constitution prohibitedfederal courts from exercising jurisdiction over domestic relations cases. Brief for Appellant in Barber v. Barber, D. T.1858, No. 44, pp. 4-5. An examination of Article III,

Barberitself, and our cases since Barber makes clear that the Constitution does not exclude domestic relations cases fromthe jurisdiction otherwise granted by statute to the federal
courts.Article III, $ 2, of the Constitution provides in pertinent
part:

"Section 2. The judicial Power shall extend to allCases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made,or which shall be made, under their Authority;--to all
Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers andConsuls;--to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;--to Controversies to which the United Statesshall be a Party;--to Controversies between two or
more States;--between a State and Citizens of anotherState;--between Citizens of different States;--between
Citizens of the same State claiming Land under Grantsof different States, and between a State, or the Citizens
thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects."
This section delineates the absolute limits on the federalcourts' jurisdiction. But in articulating three different

terms to define jurisdiction--"Cases, in Law and Equity,""Cases," and "Controversies"--this provision contains no
limitation on subjects of a domestic relations nature. Nordid Barber purport to ground the domestic relations exception in these constitutional limits on federal jurisdiction.The Court's discussion of federal judicial power to hear suits

504us2$90F 04-05-96 19:35:56 PAGES OPINPGT
696 ANKENBRANDT v. RICHARDS

Opinion of the Court
of a domestic relations nature contains no mention of theConstitution, see

Barber, 21 How., at 584, and it is logical to
presume that the Court based its statement limiting suchpower on narrower statutory, rather than broader constitutional, grounds. Cf. Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida
Gulf Coast Building & Construction Trades Council, 485U. S. 568, 575 (1988).

Subsequent decisions confirm that Barber was not relyingon constitutional limits in justifying the exception. In one
such case, for instance, the Court stated the "long estab-lished rule" that federal courts lack jurisdiction over certain
domestic relations matters as having been based on the assumptions that "husband and wife cannot usually be citizens
of different States, so long as the marriage relation continues
(a rule which has been somewhat relaxed in recent cases),
and for the further reason that a suit for divorce in itself
involves no pecuniary value." De la Rama v. De la Rama,
201 U. S. 303, 307 (1906). Since Article III contains no monetary limit on suits brought pursuant to federal diversity jurisdiction, De la Rama's articulation of the "rule" in terms of
the statutory requirements for diversity jurisdiction further
supports the view that the exception is not grounded in the
Constitution.

Moreover, even while citing with approval the Barber language purporting to limit the jurisdiction of the federal
courts over domestic relations matters, the Court has heard
appeals from territorial courts involving divorce, see, e. g.,
De la Rama, supra; Simms v. Simms, 175 U. S. 162 (1899),
and has upheld the exercise of original jurisdiction by federal
courts in the District of Columbia to decide divorce actions,
see, e. g., Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U. S. 530, 581, n. 54
(1962). Thus, even were the statements in De la Rama referring to the statutory prerequisites of diversity jurisdiction alone not persuasive testament to the statutory origins
of the rule, by hearing appeals from legislative, or Article I,
courts, this Court implicitly has made clear its understanding

697Cite as: 504 U. S. 689 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
that the source of the constraint on jurisdiction from Barberwas not Article III; otherwise the Court itself would have

lacked jurisdiction over appeals from these legislative courts.See National Mut. Ins. Co. v. Tidewater Transfer Co., 337
U. S. 582, 643 (1949) (Vinson, C. J., dissenting) ("We can nomore review a legislative court's decision of a case which is
not among those enumerated in Art. III than we can hear acase from a state court involving purely state law questions"). We therefore have no difficulty concluding thatwhen the

Barber Court "disclaim[ed] altogether any jurisdic-tion in the courts of the United States upon the subject of

divorce," 21 How., at 584, it was not basing its statement onthe Constitution.

3

B
That Article III, $ 2, does not mandate the exclusion ofdomestic relations cases from federal-court jurisdiction, however, does not mean that such courts necessarily must retainand exercise jurisdiction over such cases. Other constitutional provisions explain why this is so. Article I, $ 8, cl. 9,for example, authorizes Congress "[t]o constitute Tribunals
inferior to the supreme Court" and Article III, $ 1, statesthat "[t]he judicial Power of the United States, shall be
vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts asthe Congress may from time to time ordain and establish."

The Court's cases state the rule that "if inferior federalcourts were created, [Congress was not] required to invest
them with all the jurisdiction it was authorized to bestowunder Art. III."

Palmore v. United States, 411 U. S. 389,401 (1973).

3 We read Ohio ex rel. Popovici v. Agler, 280 U. S. 379 (1930), as in
accord with this conclusion. In that case, the Court referenced the language in In re Burrus, 136 U. S. 586 (1890), regarding the domestic relations exception and then held that a state court was not precluded by the
Constitution and relevant federal statutes from exercising jurisdiction
over a divorce suit brought against the Roumanian vice-consul. See 280
U. S., at 383-384.

Opinion of the Court
This position has held constant since at least 1845, whenthe Court stated that "the judicial power of the United

States . . . is (except in enumerated instances, applicable ex-clusively to this Court) dependent for its distribution and
organization, and for the modes of its exercise, entirely upon
the action of Congress, who possess the sole power of creat-ing the tribunals (inferior to the Supreme Court) . . . and of

investing them with jurisdiction either limited, concurrent,or exclusive, and of withholding jurisdiction from them in the
exact degrees and character which to Congress may seemproper for the public good."

Cary v. Curtis, 3 How. 236, 245.
See Sheldon v. Sill, 8 How. 441 (1850); Plaquemines Tropical
Fruit Co. v. Henderson, 170 U. S. 511 (1898); Kline v. Burke
Constr. Co., 260 U. S. 226 (1922); Lockerty v. Phillips, 319
U. S. 182 (1943). We thus turn our attention to the relevant
jurisdictional statutes.

The Judiciary Act of 1789 provided that "the circuit courts
shall have original cognizance, concurrent with the courts of
the several States, of all suits of a civil nature at common
law or in equity, where the matter in dispute exceeds, exclusive of costs, the sum or value of five hundred dollars, and
. . . an alien is a party, or the suit is between a citizen of the
State where the suit is brought, and a citizen of another
State." Act of Sept. 24, 1789, $ 11, 1 Stat. 78 (emphasis
added). The defining phrase, "all suits of a civil nature at
common law or in equity," remained a key element of statutory provisions demarcating the terms of diversity jurisdiction until 1948, when Congress amended the diversity jurisdiction provision to eliminate this phrase and replace in its
stead the term "all civil actions." 1948 Judicial Code and
Judiciary Act, 62 Stat. 930, 28 U. S. C. $ 1332.

The Barber majority itself did not expressly refer to the
diversity statute's use of the limitation on "suits of a civil
nature at common law or in equity." The dissenters in Barber, however, implicitly made such a reference, for they suggested that the federal courts had no power over certain

Opinion of the Court
domestic relations actions because the court of chancerylacked authority to issue divorce and alimony decrees. Stating that "[t]he origin and the extent of [the federal courts']jurisdiction must be sought in the laws of the United States,
and in the settled rules and principles by which those lawshave bound them," the dissenters contended that "as the jurisdiction of the chancery in England does not extend to orembrace the subjects of divorce and alimony, and as the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States in chancery isbounded by that of the chancery in England, all power or
cognizance with respect to those subjects by the courts ofthe United States

in chancery is equally excluded." Barber,21 How., at 605 (Daniel, J., dissenting). Hence, in the dissenters' view, a suit seeking such relief would not fall withinthe statutory language "all suits of a civil nature at common
law or in equity." Because the Barber Court did not dis-agree with this reason for accepting the jurisdictional limitation over the issuance of divorce and alimony decrees, it maybe inferred fairly that the jurisdictional limitation recognized by the Court rested on this statutory basis and thatthe disagreement between the Court and the dissenters thus
centered only on the extent of the limitation.We have no occasion here to join the historical debate over
whether the English court of chancery had jurisdiction tohandle certain domestic relations matters, though we note
that commentators have found some support for the Barbermajority's interpretation.

4 Certainly it was not unprecedented at the time for the Court to infer, from what it under4 See, e. g., Vestal & Foster, Implied Limitations on the Diversity Jurisdiction of Federal Courts, 41 Minn. L. Rev. 1, 28 (1956); Atwood, Domestic

stood to be English chancery practice, some guide to themeaning of the 1789 Act's jurisdictional grant. See,

e. g.,
Robinson v. Campbell, 3 Wheat. 212, 221-222 (1818). Wethus are content to rest our conclusion that a domestic relations exception exists as a matter of statutory construction
not on the accuracy of the historical justifications on whichit was seemingly based, but rather on Congress' apparent

acceptance of this construction of the diversity jurisdictionprovisions in the years prior to 1948, when the statute limited jurisdiction to "suits of a civil nature at common lawor in equity." As the court in

Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin,
Krim & Ballon v. Rosenstiel, 490 F. 2d 509, 514 (CA2 1973),
observed: "More than a century has elapsed since the
Barber dictum without any intimation of Congressional
dissatisfaction. . . . Whatever Article III may or may not
permit, we thus accept the Barber dictum as a correct interpretation of the Congressional grant." Considerations of
stare decisis have particular strength in this context, where
"the legislative power is implicated, and Congress remains
free to alter what we have done." Patterson v. McLean
Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172-173 (1989).

When Congress amended the diversity statute in 1948 to
replace the law/equity distinction with the phrase "all civil
actions," we presume Congress did so with full cognizance
of the Court's nearly century-long interpretation of the prior
statutes, which had construed the statutory diversity jurisdiction to contain an exception for certain domestic relations
matters. With respect to the 1948 amendment, the Court
has previously stated that "no changes of law or policy are
to be presumed from changes of language in the revision
unless an intent to make such changes is clearly expressed."

well-known construction of the diversity statute, and where
Congress made substantive changes to the statute in other

respects, see 28 U. S. C. $ 1332 note, we presume, absent anyindication that Congress intended to alter this exception, see

ibid.; Advisory Committee's Note 3 to Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.2, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 555, that Congress "adopt[ed] that interpretation" when it reenacted the diversity statute. Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 580 (1978).5

III
In the more than 100 years since this Court laid the seedsfor the development of the domestic relations exception, the

lower federal courts have applied it in a variety of circum-stances. See,

e. g., cases cited in n. 1, supra. Many of theseapplications go well beyond the circumscribed situations

posed by Barber and its progeny. Barber itself disclaimedfederal jurisdiction over a narrow range of domestic relations
issues involving the granting of a divorce and a decree ofalimony, see 21 How., at 584, and stated the limits on federalcourt power to intervene prior to the rendering of suchorders:

"It is, that when a court of competent jurisdiction overthe subject-matter and the parties decrees a divorce,
and alimony to the wife as its incident, and is unable ofitself to enforce the decree summarily upon the husband,
that courts of equity will interfere to prevent the decreefrom being defeated by fraud. The interference, however, is limited to cases in which alimony has been de-creed; then only to the extent of what is due, and always
to cases in which no appeal is pending from the decreefor the divorce or for alimony."

Id., at 591.

The Barber Court thus did not intend to strip the federalcourts of authority to hear cases arising from the domestic

acceptance of the Court's earlier construction of the diversity statute in
the 1948 codification. See post, at 708-709 (opinion concurring in judgment). We see nothing remarkable in this decision. See, e. g., Flood v.
Kuhn, 407 U. S. 258, 283-284 (1972).

Opinion of the Court
relations of persons unless they seek the granting or modifi-cation of a divorce or alimony decree. The holding of the

case itself sanctioned the exercise of federal jurisdiction overthe enforcement of an alimony decree that had been properly
obtained in a state court of competent jurisdiction. Contrary to the Barber dissenters' position, the enforcement ofsuch validly obtained orders does not "regulate the domestic

relations of society" and produce an "inquisitorial authority"in which federal tribunals "enter the habitations and even
into the chambers and nurseries of private families, and in-quire into and pronounce upon the morals and habits and
affections or antipathies of the members of every household."
Id., at 602 (Daniel, J., dissenting). And from the conclusion
that the federal courts lacked jurisdiction to issue divorce
and alimony decrees, there was no dissent. See id., at 604
(Daniel, J., dissenting) (noting that "[u]pon questions of settlement or of contract connected with marriages, the court
of chancery will undertake the enforcement of such contracts, but does not decree alimony as such, and independently of such contracts"). See also Simms v. Simms, 175
U. S., at 167 (stating that "[i]t may therefore be assumed as
indubitable that the Circuit Courts of the United States have
no jurisdiction, either of suits for divorce, or of claims for
alimony, whether made in a suit for divorce, or by an original
proceeding in equity, before a decree for such alimony in a
state court").

Subsequently, this Court expanded the domestic relations
exception to include decrees in child custody cases. In a
child custody case brought pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus, for instance, the Court held void a writ issued by a Federal District Court to restore a child to the custody of the
father. "As to the right to the control and possession of this
child, as it is contested by its father and its grandfather, it
is one in regard to which neither the Congress of the United
States nor any authority of the United States has any special
jurisdiction." In re Burrus, 136 U. S., at 594.

703Cite as: 504 U. S. 689 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
Although In re Burrus technically did not involve a con-struction of the diversity statute, as we understand Barber

to have done, its statement that "[t]he whole subject of thedomestic relations of husband and wife, parent and child, belongs to the laws of the States and not to the laws of theUnited States,"

id., at 593-594, has been interpreted by thefederal courts to apply with equal vigor in suits brought

pursuant to diversity jurisdiction. See, e. g., Bennett v.Bennett, 221 U. S. App. D. C. 90, 93, 682 F. 2d 1039, 1042
(1982); Solomon v. Solomon, 516 F. 2d 1018, 1025 (CA3 1975);Hernstadt v. Hernstadt, 373 F. 2d 316, 317 (CA2 1967); see
generally 13B C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, FederalPractice and Procedure $ 3609, pp. 477-479, nn. 28-32 (1984).
This application is consistent with Barber's directive to limitfederal courts' exercise of diversity jurisdiction over suits
for divorce and alimony decrees. See Barber, 21 How., at584.

6 We conclude, therefore, that the domestic relations

exception, as articulated by this Court since Barber, diveststhe federal courts of power to issue divorce, alimony, and

child custody decrees. Given the long passage of time with-out any expression of congressional dissatisfaction, we have
no trouble today reaffirming the validity of the exception asit pertains to divorce and alimony decrees and child custody orders.Not only is our conclusion rooted in respect for this longheld understanding, it is also supported by sound policy con-siderations. Issuance of decrees of this type not infrequently involves retention of jurisdiction by the court and

6 The better reasoned views among the Courts of Appeals have similarly
stated the domestic relations exception as narrowly confined to suits for
divorce, alimony, or child custody decrees. See, e. g., McIntyre v. McIntyre, 771 F. 2d, at 1317 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) ("[T]he exception to jurisdiction arises in those cases where a federal court is asked to grant a
decree of divorce or annulment, or to grant custody or fix payments for
support"); Lloyd v. Loeffler, 694 F. 2d, at 492 (same); Bennett v. Bennett,
221 U. S. App. D. C., at 93, 682 F. 2d, at 1042 (same); Cole v. Cole, 633 F.

Opinion of the Court
deployment of social workers to monitor compliance. As amatter of judicial economy, state courts are more eminently

suited to work of this type than are federal courts, whichlack the close association with state and local government
organizations dedicated to handling issues that arise out ofconflicts over divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees.
Moreover, as a matter of judicial expertise, it makes far moresense to retain the rule that federal courts lack power to
issue these types of decrees because of the special proficiencydeveloped by state tribunals over the past century and a half
in handling issues that arise in the granting of such decrees.See

Lloyd v. Loeffler, 694 F. 2d 489, 492 (CA7 1982).By concluding, as we do, that the domestic relations exception encompasses only cases involving the issuance of a di-vorce, alimony, or child custody decree, we necessarily find
that the Court of Appeals erred by affirming the DistrictCourt's invocation of this exception. This lawsuit in no
way seeks such a decree; rather, it alleges that respondentsRichards and Kesler committed torts against L. R. and
S. R., Ankenbrandt's children by Richards. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to $ 1332 thus is proper in this
case.7 We now address whether, even though subject-matter jurisdiction might be proper, sufficient grounds exist
to warrant abstention from the exercise of that jurisdiction.

IV
The Court of Appeals, as did the District Court, statedabstention as an alternative ground for its holding. The

District Court quoted another federal court to the effect that" `[a]bstention, that doctrine designed to promote federalstate comity, is required when to render a decision would

7 The courts below offered no explanation, and we are aware of none,
why the domestic relations exception applies at all to respondent Kesler,
who would appear to stand in the same position with respect to Ankenbrandt as any other opponent in a tort suit brought in federal court pursuant to diversity jurisdiction.

Zaubi v. Hoejme, 530 F. Supp.
831, 836 (WD Pa. 1980)). It is axiomatic, however, that"[a]bstention from the exercise of federal jurisdiction is the

exception, not the rule." Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U. S. 800, 813 (1976). Absten-tion rarely should be invoked, because the federal courts

have a "virtually unflagging obligation . . . to exercise thejurisdiction given them."

Id., at 817.
The courts below cited Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37(1971), to support their holdings to abstain in this case. In

so doing, the courts clearly erred. Younger itself held that,
absent unusual circumstances, a federal court could not interfere with a pending state criminal prosecution. Id., at
54. Though we have extended Younger abstention to the
civil context, see, e. g., Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v.
Garden State Bar Assn., 457 U. S. 423 (1982); Ohio Civil
Rights Comm'n v. Dayton Christian Schools, Inc., 477 U. S.
619 (1986); Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco Inc., 481 U. S. 1 (1987), we
have never applied the notions of comity so critical to
Younger's "Our Federalism" when no state proceeding was
pending nor any assertion of important state interests made.
In this case, there is no allegation by respondents of any
pending state proceedings, and Ankenbrandt contends that
such proceedings ended prior to her filing this lawsuit. Absent any pending proceeding in state tribunals, therefore,
application by the lower courts of Younger abstention was
clearly erroneous.

It is not inconceivable, however, that in certain circumstances, the abstention principles developed in Burford v.
Sun Oil Co., 319 U. S. 315 (1943), might be relevant in a case
involving elements of the domestic relationship even when
the parties do not seek divorce, alimony, or child custody.
This would be so when a case presents "difficult questions of
state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public
import whose importance transcends the result in the case

then at bar." Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.,supra, at 814. Such might well be the case if a federal suit

were filed prior to effectuation of a divorce, alimony, or childcustody decree, and the suit depended on a determination of
the status of the parties. Where, as here, the status of thedomestic relationship has been determined as a matter of
state law, and in any event has no bearing on the underlyingtorts alleged, we have no difficulty concluding that

Burfordabstention is inappropriate in this case.

V
We thus conclude that the Court of Appeals erred by af-firming the District Court's rulings to decline jurisdiction

based on the domestic relations exception to diversity juris-diction and to abstain under the doctrine of Younger v. Harris, supra. The exception has no place in a suit such as thisone, in which a former spouse sues another on behalf of children alleged to have been abused. Because the allegationsin this complaint do not request the District Court to issue
a divorce, alimony, or child custody decree, we hold that the

8 Moreover, should Burford abstention be relevant in other circumstances, it may be appropriate for the court to retain jurisdiction to ensure
prompt and just disposition of the matter upon the determination by the
state court of the relevant issue. Cf. Kaiser Steel Corp. v. W. S. Ranch
Co., 391 U. S. 593, 594 (1968).

Though he acknowledges that our earlier cases invoking the domestic
relations exceptions speak in jurisdictional terms, Justice Blackmun
nevertheless would reinterpret them to support a special abstention doctrine for such cases. See post, at 713-716 (opinion concurring in judgment). Yet in briefly sketching his vision of how such a doctrine might
operate, Justice Blackmun offers no authoritative support for where
such an abstention doctrine might be found, no principled reason why we
should retroactively concoct an abstention doctrine out of whole cloth to
account for federal court practice in existence for 82 years prior to the
announcement of the first abstention doctrine in Railroad Comm'n of
Texas v. Pullman Co., 312 U. S. 496 (1941), and no persuasive reason why
articulation of such an abstention doctrine offers a sounder way of achieving the same result than our construction of the statute.

Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceed-ings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Blackmun, concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the Court that the District Court had juris-diction over petitioner's claims in tort. Moreover, I agree

that the federal courts should not entertain claims for di-vorce, alimony, and child custody. I am unable to agree,
however, that the diversity statute contains any "exception"for domestic relations matters. The Court goes to remarkable lengths to craft an exception that is simply not in thestatute and is not supported by the case law. In my view,
the longstanding, unbroken practice of the federal courts inrefusing to hear domestic relations cases is precedent at
most for continued discretionary abstention rather than man-datory limits on federal jurisdiction. For these reasons I
concur only in the Court's judgment.

I
The Court holds that the diversity statute contains an "ex-ception" for cases seeking the issuance of a divorce, alimony,

or child custody decree. Ante, at 701-704. Yet no such ex-ception appears in the statute. The diversity statute is not
ambiguous at all. It extends the jurisdiction of the districtcourts to "

all civil actions" between diverse parties involvingthe requisite amount in controversy. 28 U. S. C. $ 1332 (emphasis added).This Court has recognized that in the absence of a "clearly
expressed" intention to the contrary, the language of thestatute itself is ordinarily "conclusive." See,

e. g., ConsumerProduct Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U. S.

708 ANKENBRANDT v. RICHARDS

Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment
102, 108 (1980). The Court apparently discovers in the history of the diversity statute and this Court's own case law a
clearly expressed intention contrary to the words of the statute. First, the Court observes that the diversity statute
formerly extended only to "all suits of a civil nature at
common law or in equity" rather than to "all civil actions."
Ante, at 698. Then the Court interprets this Court's decision in Barber v. Barber, 21 How. 582 (1859), to read into this
"common law or equity" limitation an exclusion of matters,
such as actions for divorce and alimony, that were not cognizable in the English courts of common law and equity. Ante,
at 698-699. The Court points to what it regards as Congress' "apparent acceptance" of this construction of the
diversity statute. Ante, at 700. Finally, notwithstanding
Congress' replacement in 1948 of the "common law and equity" limitation with the phrase "all civil actions," the Court
considers this to be evidence that Congress adopted the prior
"well-known construction" of the diversity statute. Ibid.

I have great difficulty with the Court's approach. Starting at the most obvious point, I do not see how a language
change that, if anything, expands the jurisdictional scope of
the statute can be said to constitute evidence of approval of
a prior narrow construction.1 Any inaction on the part of
Congress in 1948 in failing expressly to mention domestic
relations matters in the diversity statute reflects the fact, as
is discussed below, that Congress likely had no idea until the

1 To be sure, this modification in language was part of a wholesale revision of the Judicial Code in 1948, and this Court has recognized that "no
changes of law or policy are to be presumed from changes of language in
the revision unless an intent to make such changes is clearly expressed."
Fourco Glass Co. v. Transmirra Products Corp., 353 U. S. 222, 227 (1957);
see Finley v. United States, 490 U. S. 545, 554 (1989). This principle may
negate an inference that the change in language expanded the scope of
the statute, but it does not affirmatively authorize an inference that Congress' recodification was designed to approve of prior constructions of
the statute.

Court's decision today that the diversity statute contained
an exception for domestic relations matters.

This leads to my primary concern: the Court's conclusion
that Congress understood Barber as an interpretation of the
diversity statute. Barber did not express any intent to construe the diversity statute--clearly, Barber "cited no authority and did not discuss the foundation for its announcement"
disclaiming jurisdiction over divorce and alimony matters.
Ante, at 694. As the Court puts it, it may only be "inferred"
that the basis for declining jurisdiction was the diversity
statute. Ante, at 699. It is inferred not from anything in
the Barber majority opinion. Rather, it is inferred from the
comments of a dissenting Justice and the absence of rebuttal
by the Barber majority. Ante, at 699.2 The Court today
has a difficult enough time arriving at this unlikely interpretation of the Barber decision. I cannot imagine that Congress ever assembled this construction on its own.

In any event, at least three subsequent decisions of this
Court seriously undermine any inference that Barber's recognition of a domestic relations "exception" traces to a "common law or equity" limitation of the diversity statute. In
Simms v. Simms, 175 U. S. 162 (1899), the Court heard an
appeal by a husband from the Supreme Court of the Territory of Arizona affirming the territorial District Court's dismissal of his bill for divorce and its award to his wife of
alimony and counsel fees pendente lite. The wife sought
dismissal of the appeal to this Court because the suit involved domestic relations. In contrast to Barber, the Court

2 Moreover, as the Court intimates, ante, at 699, and n. 4, there is good
reason to question the Barber dissent's interpretation of English practice.
The historical evidence, while not unequivocal, suggests that the English
chancery courts did in fact exercise some jurisdiction over matrimonial
matters. See, e. g., Lloyd v. Loeffler, 694 F. 2d 489, 491-492 (CA7 1982);
Spindel v. Spindel, 283 F. Supp. 797, 802-803, 806-809 (EDNY 1968); Atwood, Domestic Relations Cases in Federal Court: Toward a Principled

undertook an extensive review and discussion of the statu-tory bases for its jurisdiction over the appeal. It expressly

recognized that its appellate jurisdiction was confined to"those cases, and those cases only,

at law or in equity." 175
U. S., at 167 (emphasis added).3 Nevertheless, the Court in
Simms did not find the "common law or equity" limitation to
be a bar to jurisdiction.4 The Court distinguished Barber,
not on grounds that the jurisdictional statute in Barber waslimited to cases in law and equity while that in

Simms was
not--indeed, it could not be so distinguished. The Courtdistinguished

Barber on grounds that it involved domestic
relations matters in the States rather than in the Territories.It reasoned that the whole subject of domestic relations "belongs to the laws of the State, and not to the laws of the
United States," while "[i]n the Territories of the United
States, Congress has the entire dominion and sovereignty,
national and local." 175 U. S., at 167-168. Today the Court
infers an interpretation of Barber that the Court in Simms
plainly rejected.

The second decision undermining the Court's interpretation of Barber is De la Rama v. De la Rama, 201 U. S. 303
(1906), in which the Court took jurisdiction over an appeal

3 The Court stated:
"[T]he appellate jurisdiction of this court to review and reverse or affirm
the final judgments and decrees of the Supreme Court of a Territory includes those cases, and those cases only, at law or in equity, in which `the
matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, shall exceed the sum of five thousand
dollars.' " 175 U. S., at 167.

See also id., at 166 (citing the Act of Mar. 3, 1885, ch. 355, 23 Stat. 443,
limiting appellate jurisdiction from the territorial courts to "any suit at
law or in equity").

4 The Court concluded it could not review the question of divorce, because it involved "no matter of law, but mere questions of fact" and because, contrary to the statutory amount-in-controversy requirement, it involved "a matter the value of which could not be estimated in money."

The "common law or equity" limitation the Court now finds
so significant was not among those reasons.5 This was soeven though the appellate jurisdictional statute at issue

there extended to "all actions, cases, causes, and proceed-ings," 32 Stat. 695, opening the door for the Court easily to
have distinguished Barber on the grounds of the "commonlaw or equity" limitation in the diversity statute. Instead,

Barber, the Court pointed to the absence of
any need to defer to the States' regulation of the area ofdomestic relations in the context of an appeal from a nonstate, territorial court. 201 U. S., at 308.

The third decision is Ohio ex rel. Popovici v. Agler, 280
U. S. 379 (1930). In Popovici, a Roumanian vice consul was
sued by his wife in an Ohio state court for a divorce and
alimony. He defended by claiming that the Ohio state court
had no jurisdiction to grant the divorce, because federal statutes granted exclusive jurisdiction to the federal courts of
" `all suits and proceedings against . . . consuls or viceconsuls' " and " `all suits against consuls and vice-consuls.' "

5 The Court in De la Rama justified the exception "both by reason of
fact that the husband and wife cannot usually be citizens of different
States, so long as the marriage relation continues (a rule which has been
somewhat relaxed in recent cases), and for the further reason that a suit
for divorce in itself involves no pecuniary value." 201 U. S., at 307. The
first reason obviously was discounted by De la Rama itself and is of course
untenable today. The second reason can apply only to nonmonetary
divorce actions but not to actions for alimony above the amount-incontroversy limitation. The second reason, moreover, was disclaimed by
De la Rama itself in joint divorce and alimony actions. Id., at 310. At
any rate, in view of De la Rama's explanation, surely the Court is mistaken when it states it "has never addressed the basis" for the domestic
relations exception. Ante, at 694.

Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment
Id., at 382-383 (quoting the Act of Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, 36Stat. 1161, 1093). Rejecting this claim, Justice Holmes observed for a unanimous Court that the jurisdictional statutes"do not affect the present case if it be true as has been unquestioned for three-quarters of a century that the Courtsof the United States have no jurisdiction over divorce." 280
U. S., at 383. The Court traced this absence of jurisdictionnot to the diversity statute but apparently to the Constitution itself:

"If when the Constitution was adopted the common un-derstanding was that the domestic relations of husband

and wife and parent and child were matters reserved tothe States, there is no difficulty in construing the instrument accordingly and not much in dealing with the stat-utes. `Suits against consuls and vice-consuls' must be
taken to refer to ordinary civil proceedings and not toinclude what formerly would have belonged to the ecclesiastical Courts." Id., at 383-384.
I think it implausible to believe that, especially after Popovici, Congress could be said to have accepted this Court'sdecision in

Barber as simply a construction of the diversitystatute.
6 Accordingly, the Court is without a requisite foundation for ratifying what Congress intended. Cf. Flood v.
Kuhn, 407 U. S. 258, 283-284 (1972) (declining to overturn

6 The Court claims that "by hearing appeals from legislative, or Article
I, courts, this Court implicitly has made clear its understanding that the
source of the constraint on jurisdiction from Barber was not Article III;
otherwise the Court itself would have lacked jurisdiction over appeals
from these legislative courts." Ante, at 696-697. The Court, however,
overlooks the rule that "[w]hen questions of jurisdiction have been passed
on in prior decisions sub silentio, this Court has never considered itself
bound when a subsequent case finally brings the jurisdictional issue before
us." Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U. S. 528, 535, n. 5 (1974); see Pennhurst

prior precedent explicitly exempting professional baseballfrom antitrust laws where Congress "by its positive inaction"

has allowed prior decisions to stand).Even assuming the Court today correctly interprets Barber, its extension of any domestic relations "exception" to thediversity statute for child custody matters is not warranted
by any known principles of statutory construction. TheCourt relies on

In re Burrus, 136 U. S. 586 (1890), in whichthe Court denied the "jurisdiction" of a Federal District

Court to issue a writ of habeas corpus in favor of a father torecover the care and custody of his child from the child's
grandfather. That case did not involve the diversity statute,but rather the habeas corpus statute, and the Court expressly declined to address the diversity statute.7 Id., at597. To the Court today this is just a "technica[l]" distinction. Ante, at 703. I find it germane, because, to the bestof my knowledge, a court is not at liberty to craft exceptions
to statutes that are not at issue in a case.

II

A
To reject the Court's construction of the diversity statuteis not, however, necessarily to reject the federal courts' long7 If, in Barber, the Court might have been said plausibly to have relied
on limitations of the English chancery courts with respect to divorce and
alimony, it seems highly unlikely that the Court in Burrus might have
relied on a similar justification for child custody matters. The Court in
Burrus attached as an appendix to its opinion, 136 U. S., at 597, a "very
instructive" and "a very careful and a very able opinion," In the Matter
of Barry, from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern
District of New York. See In re Burrus, 136 U. S., at 594. That opinion
stated that child custody matters "res[t] solely in England on the common
law" and that such determinations "devolved upon the high courts of
equity and law." Id., at 609. See also Lehman v. Lycoming County
Children's Services Agency, 458 U. S. 502, 524 (1982) (dissenting opinion)
("Historically, the English common-law courts permitted parents to use
the habeas writ to obtain custody of a child as a way of vindicating their
own rights").

standing practice of declining to hear certain domestic rela-tions cases. My point today is that no coherent "jurisdictional" explanation for this practice emerges from our line ofsuch cases, and it is unreasonable to presume that Congress
divined and accepted one from these cases. To be sure, this
Court's old line of domestic relations cases disclaimed "juris-diction" over domestic relations matters well before the

growth and general acceptance in recent decades of moderndoctrines of federal abstention that distinguish the refusal to
exercise jurisdiction from disclaiming jurisdiction altogether.See generally C. Wright, Federal Courts 302-330 (1983)
(discussing growth of traditional abstention doctrines). See
also Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S. 536, 538-539 (1976)
(recognizing abstention in the context of the habeas corpus
statute where "considerations of comity and concerns for the
orderly administration of criminal justice require"). Nevertheless, the common concern reflected in these earlier cases
is, in modern terms, abstentional--and not jurisdictional--in
nature. These cases are premised not upon a concern for
the historical limitation of equity jurisdiction of the English
courts, but upon the virtually exclusive primacy at that time
of the States in the regulation of domestic relations. As
noted above, in Simms and De la Rama, this Court justified
its exercise of jurisdiction over actions for divorce and alimony not by any reference to the scope of equity jurisdiction
but by reference to the absence of any interest of the States
in appeals from courts in territories controlled by the National Government. Similarly, in cases wholly outside the
"common law or equity" limitation of the diversity statute,
the Court has denied federal court review. Ohio ex rel. Popovici v. Agler, 280 U. S. 379 (1930) (consuls and vice-consuls
statutes); In re Burrus, supra (habeas corpus). As the
Court once stated: "The whole subject of the domestic relations of husband and wife, parent and child, belongs to the
laws of the States and not to the laws of the United States."
Id., at 593-594.

Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment
Whether the interest of States remains a sufficient justifi-cation today for abstention is uncertain in view of the expansion in recent years of federal law in the domestic relationsarea.

8 I am confident, nonetheless, that the unbroken and

unchallenged practice of the federal courts since before theWar Between the States of declining to hear certain domestic relations cases provides the very rare justification for con-tinuing to do so. It is not without significance, moreover,
that, because of this historical practice of the federal courts,the States have developed specialized courts and institutions
in family matters, while Congress and the federal courtsgenerally have not done so. Absent a contrary command of
Congress, the federal courts properly should abstain, at leastfrom diversity actions traditionally excluded from the federal
courts, such as those seeking divorce, alimony, and childcustody.

The Court is correct that abstention "rarely should be in-voked." Ante, at 705. But rarer still--and by far the
greater affront to Congress--should be the occasions whenthis Court invents statutory exceptions that are simply not
there. It is one thing for this Court to defer to more thana century of practice unquestioned by Congress. It is quite

Like the diversity statute, the federal-question grant of jurisdiction in
Article III of the Constitution limits the judicial power in federal-question
cases to "Cases, in Law and Equity." Art. III, $ 2. Assuming this limitation applies with equal force in the constitutional context as the Court
finds today that it does in the statutory context, the Court's decision today
casts grave doubts upon Congress' ability to confer federal-question jurisdiction (as under 28 U. S. C. $ 1331) on the federal courts in any matters
involving divorces, alimony, and child custody.

another to defer on a pretext that Congress legislated what
in fact it never did. Although there is no occasion to resolve
the issue in definitive fashion in this case, I would suggest
that principles of abstention provide a more principled basis
for the Court's continued disinclination to entertain domestic
relations matters.9

B

Whether or not the domestic relations "exception" is properly grounded in principles of abstention or principles of
jurisdiction, I do not believe this case falls within the exception. This case only peripherally involves the subject
of "domestic relations." "Domestic relations" actions are
loosely classifiable into four categories. The first, or "core,"
category involves declarations of status, e. g., marriage, annulment, divorce, custody, and paternity. The second, or
"semicore," category involves declarations of rights or obligations arising from status (or former status), e. g., alimony,
child support, and division of property. The third category
consists of secondary suits to enforce declarations of status,
rights, or obligations. The final, catchall category covers
the suits not directly involving status or obligations arising
from status but that nonetheless generally relate to domestic
relations matters, e. g., tort suits between family or former
family members for sexual abuse, battering, or intentional
infliction of emotional distress. None of this Court's prior
cases that consider the domestic relations "exception" involves the type of periphery domestic relations claim at
issue here.

9 As this Court has previously observed that the various types of abstention are not "rigid pigeonholes," Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco Inc., 481 U. S. 1,
11, n. 9 (1987); New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council of New Orleans, 491 U. S. 350, 359 (1989), there is no need to affix a label to the
abstention principles I suggest. Nevertheless, I fully agree with the
Court that Younger abstention is inappropriate on the facts before us,
because of the absence of any pending state proceeding.

Petitioner does not seek a determination of status or obli-gations arising from status. Moreover, any federal court

determination of petitioner's claims will neither upset a priorstate court determination of status or obligations appurtenant to status nor pre-empt a pending state court determina-tion of this nature. Cf.

Moore v. Sims, 442 U. S. 415 (1979)(applying Younger abstention doctrine to prevent federal

court action seeking to enjoin pending state child custodyproceeding brought by state authorities). While petitioner's claims do not involve a federal question or statute--thepresence of which would strongly counsel against abstention,
see Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United
States, 424 U. S. 800, 815, n. 21 (1976)--petitioner's state-lawtort claims for money damages are easily cognizable in a

is the same. The judgment of the Court of Appeals must be

MORGAN v. ILLINOIS
certiorari to the supreme court of illinois
No. 91-5118. Argued January 21, 1992--Decided June 15, 1992
The trial of a capital offense in Illinois is conducted in two phases, with

the same jury determining both a defendant's guilt and whether the
death penalty should be imposed. In accordance with state law, the
trial court conducted the voir dire to select the jury for petitioner Morgan's capital murder trial. The State requested, pursuant to Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510, that the court ask the jurors whether
they would automatically vote against the death penalty no matter what
the facts of the case were. However, the court refused Morgan's request to ask if any jurors would automatically vote to impose the death
penalty regardless of the facts, stating that it had asked substantially
that question. In fact, every empaneled juror was asked generally
whether each could be fair and impartial, and most were asked whether
they could follow "instructions on the law." Morgan was convicted and
sentenced to death. The State Supreme Court affirmed, ruling that a
trial court is not required to include in voir dire a "life qualifying" or
"reverse-Witherspoon" question upon request.

Held: The trial court's refusal to inquire whether potential jurors would

automatically impose the death penalty upon convicting Morgan is inconsistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Pp. 725-739.

(a) Due process demands that a jury provided to a capital defendant
at the sentencing phase must stand impartial and indifferent to the
extent commanded by the Sixth Amendment. See, e. g., id., at 518.
Pp. 726-728.

(b) Based on this impartiality requirement, a capital defendant may
challenge for cause any prospective juror who will automatically vote
for the death penalty. Such a juror will fail in good faith to consider
the evidence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances as the instructions require. Cf., e. g., Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U. S. 412, 424.
Pp. 728-729.

(c) On voir dire a trial court must, at a defendant's request, inquire
into the prospective jurors' views on capital punishment. Part of the
guarantee of a defendant's right to an impartial jury is an adequate voir
dire to identify unqualified jurors. Morgan could not exercise intelligently his challenge for cause against prospective jurors who would unwaveringly impose death after a finding of guilt unless he was given the

720 MORGAN v. ILLINOIS

Syllabus
opportunity to identify such persons by questioning them at voir dire
about their views on the death penalty. Cf. Lockhart v. McCree, 476
U. S. 162, 170, n. 7. Absent that opportunity, his right not to be tried
by those who would always impose death would be rendered as nugatory and meaningless as the State's right, in the absence of questioning,
to strike those who never do so. Pp. 729-734.

(d) The trial court's voir dire was insufficient to satisfy Morgan's right
to make inquiry. The State's own request for questioning under Witherspoon and Witt belies its argument that the general fairness and "follow the law" questions asked by the trial court were enough to detect
those in the venire who would automatically impose death. Such jurors
could in all truth and candor respond affirmatively to both types of questions, personally confident that their dogmatic views are fair and impartial, while leaving the specific concern unprobed. More importantly,
the belief that death should be imposed ipso facto upon conviction reflects directly on an individual's inability to follow the law. Pp. 734-736.

(e) A juror to whom mitigating evidence is irrelevant is plainly saying
that such evidence is not worth consideration, a view which has long
been rejected by this Court and which finds no basis in Illinois statutory
or decisional law. Here, the instruction accords with the State's death
penalty statute, which requires that the jury be instructed to consider
any relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, lists certain relevant
mitigating factors, and directs the jury to consider whether the mitigating factors are "sufficient to preclude" the death penalty's imposition.
Since the statute plainly indicates that a lesser sentence is available in
every case where mitigating evidence exists, a juror who would invariably impose the death penalty would not give the mitigating evidence
the consideration the statute contemplates. Pp. 736-739.

Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court.
We decide here whether, during voir dire for a capital of-fense, a state trial court may, consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, refuse inquiryinto whether a potential juror would automatically impose
the death penalty upon conviction of the defendant.

I
The trial of a capital offense in Illinois is conducted in twophases. The defendant must first be convicted of firstdegree murder, as defined in Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, || 9-1(a)(Supp. 1990). Illinois law uses the same jury that decided
guilt to determine whether the death penalty shall be im-posed,

1 and upon conviction, a separate sentencing hearing

commences to determine the existence of aggravating andmitigating factors. || 9-1(d)(1). To be eligible for the death

penalty, the jury must find unanimously, || 9-1(g), and beyonda reasonable doubt, || 9-1(f), that the defendant was at least
18 years old at the time of the murder, and that at least 1 of10 enumerated aggravating factors exists, || 9-1(b). See,
e. g., || 9-1(b)(5) (murder for hire or by contract); || 9-1(b)(10)(premeditated murder by preconceived plan). If the jury
finds none of the statutory aggravating factors to exist, thedefendant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment. || 9-1(g).
"If there is a unanimous finding by the jury that one or more

D. Lyon.

1 The defendant may, however, elect to waive sentencing by the jury.

Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, || 9-1(d)(3) (Supp. 1990). The procedure and standards that guide a sentencing judge, || 9-1(h), are identical to those that
guide a jury, || 9-1(g).

of the factors set forth in subsection (b) exist, the jury shall
consider aggravating and mitigating factors as instructed by
the court and shall determine whether the sentence of death
shall be imposed." Ibid. As part of this balance, the jury
is instructed to consider mitigating factors existing in the
case, five of which are enumerated, but which are not exclusive. || 9-1(c). The State may also present evidence of
relevant aggravating factors beyond those enumerated by
statute. Ibid. "If the jury determines unanimously that
there are no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude the imposition of the death sentence, the court shall sentence the
defendant to death." || 9-1(g).

Petitioner Derrick Morgan was convicted in Cook County,
Illinois, of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. The
evidence at trial amply proved that petitioner was hired to
kill a narcotics dealer apparently competing with the El
Rukns, one of Chicago's violent inner-city gangs. For
$4,000, petitioner lured the dealer, who was a friend, into an
abandoned apartment and shot him in the head six times.
Upon consideration of factors in aggravation and mitigation,
the jury sentenced him to death.

Three separate venires were required to be called before
the jury was finally chosen. In accordance with Illinois law,
the trial court, rather than the attorneys, conducted voir
dire. People v. Gacy, 103 Ill. 2d 1, 36-37, 468 N. E. 2d 1171,
1184-1185 (1984). The State, having elected to pursue
capital punishment, requested inquiry permitted by Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510 (1968), to determine whether
any potential juror would in all instances refuse to impose
the death penalty upon conviction of the offense. Accordingly, the trial court, over opposition from the defense, questioned each venire whether any member had moral or religious principles so strong that he or she could not impose
the death penalty "regardless of the facts." App. 9, 78, 90.
Seventeen potential jurors were excused when they ex504us2$91K 04-08-96 07:15:12 PAGES OPINPGT

pressed substantial doubts about their ability to follow Illi-nois law in deciding whether to impose a sentence of death.

Id., at 9-22, 79-83, 90-94. All of the jurors eventuallyempaneled were also questioned individually under Witherspoon, each receiving and responding in the negative to thisquestion or a slight variation: "Would you automatically vote
against the death penalty no matter what the facts of thecase were?" App. 33; see

id., at 36, 41, 48, 55, 59, 64, 69, 76,88, 97, 103.

After seven members of the first venire had been ques-tioned, including three who eventually became jurors, petitioner's counsel requested the trial court to ask all prospective jurors the following question: "If you found DerrickMorgan guilty, would you automatically vote to impose the

death penalty no matter what the facts are?" Id., at 44.The trial court refused this request, stating that it had
"asked the question in a different vein substantially in thatnature."

Ibid.
Prior to the voir dire of the three venires, the trial courthad explained in general terms the dictates of Illinois procedure in capital trials, as outlined above. See id., at 24, 77-
78, 90. During voir dire, the trial court received from 9 ofthe 12 jurors empaneled an affirmative response to variations of this question: "Would you follow my instructions onthe law even though you may not agree?"

Id., at 30; see id.,
at 38, 43, 49, 56, 60, 64, 69, 107. However, the trial court didnot ask three of the jurors this question in any way. See

id., at 73-77, 83-89, 94-100. Every juror eventually empan-eled was asked generally whether each could be fair and impartial.2 Each juror responded appropriately to at least one

you might not agree?

56, 61, 65, 77, 100, 110. When empaneled, each member ofthe jury further swore an oath to "well and truly try the
issues joined herein and true deliverance make between thePeople of the State of Illinois and the defendant at the bar
and a true verdict render according to the law and the evi-dence." 1 Tr. 601-602; see

id., at 264, 370, 429, 507, 544,575-576.

On appeal, the Illinois Supreme Court affirmed petition-er's conviction and death sentence, rejecting petitioner's
claim that, pursuant to Ross v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 81(1988),

voir dire must include the "life qualifying" or"reverse-Witherspoon" question upon request. The Illinois

Supreme Court concluded that nothing requires a trial courtto question potential jurors so as to identify and exclude any
who would vote for the death penalty in every case afterconviction for a capital offense. 142 Ill. 2d 410, 470, 568

way to afford a defendant every possible safeguard. The `reverseWitherspoon' question may not be the only means of ensuring defendant
an impartial jury, but it is certainly the most direct. The best way to
ensure that a prospective juror would not automatically vote for the death
penalty is to ask." People v. Jackson, 145 Ill. 2d 43, 110, 582 N. E. 2d

scheme," Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U. S. 447, 464 (1984) (cita-tions omitted), and that no State is constitutionally required

by the Sixth Amendment or otherwise to provide for jurydetermination of whether the death penalty shall be imposed
on a capital defendant, ibid. Illinois has chosen, however,to delegate to the jury this task in the penalty phase of
capital trials in addition to its duty to determine guilt orinnocence of the underlying crime. The issue, therefore, is
whether petitioner is entitled to relief under the Due ProcessClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We conclude that he
is, and in the course of doing so we deal with four issues:whether a jury provided to a capital defendant at the sentencing phase must be impartial; whether such defendant isentitled to challenge for cause and have removed on the
ground of bias a prospective juror who will automaticallyvote for the death penalty irrespective of the facts or the
trial court's instructions of law; whether on voir dire thecourt must, on defendant's request, inquire into the prospective jurors' views on capital punishment; and whether the
voir dire in this case was constitutionally sufficient.

A
Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145 (1968), held that theFourteenth Amendment guaranteed a right of jury trial in

all state criminal cases which, were they tried in a federalcourt, would come within the Sixth Amendment's guarantee
of trial by jury. Prior to this decision applying the SixthAmendment's jury trial provision to the States, we recognized in Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717 (1961), and in Turnerv. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 466 (1965), that the Fourteenth
Amendment's Due Process Clause itself independently re-quired the impartiality of any jury empaneled to try a cause:

"Although this Court has said that the FourteenthAmendment does not demand the use of jury trials in a
State's criminal procedure, Fay v. New York, 332 U. S.261 [(1947)]; Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319 [(1937)],

Opinion of the Court
every State has constitutionally provided trial by jury.
See Columbia University Legislative Drafting Research
Fund, Index Digest of State Constitutions, 578-579
(1959). In essence, the right to jury trial guarantees to
the criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial,
`indifferent' jurors. The failure to accord an accused a
fair hearing violates even the minimal standards of due
process. In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257 [(1948)]; Tumey v.

Ohio, 273 U. S. 510 [(1927)]. `A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process.' In re Murchison, 349 U. S. 133, 136 [(1955)]. In the ultimate analysis, only the jury can strip a man of his liberty or his
life. In the language of Lord Coke, a juror must be
as `indifferent as he stands unsworne.' Co. Litt. 155b.
His verdict must be based upon the evidence developed
at the trial. Cf. Thompson v. City of Louisville, 362
U. S. 199 [(1960)]. This is true, regardless of the heinousness of the crime charged, the apparent guilt of the
offender or the station in life which he occupies. It was
so written into our law as early as 1807 by Chief Justice
Marshall in 1 Burr's Trial 416 (1807). `The theory of
the law is that a juror who has formed an opinion cannot
be impartial.' Reynolds v. United States, 98 U. S. 145,
155 [(1879)]." Irvin v. Dowd, supra, at 721-722 (footnote omitted).

In Turner v. Louisiana, we relied on this passage to delineate "the nature of the jury trial which the Fourteenth
Amendment commands when trial by jury is what the State
has purported to accord." 379 U. S., at 471. In short, as
reflected in the passage above, due process alone has long
demanded that, if a jury is to be provided the defendant,
regardless of whether the Sixth Amendment requires it, the
jury must stand impartial and indifferent to the extent commanded by the Sixth Amendment. Id., at 472, and n. 10; cf.
Groppi v. Wisconsin, 400 U. S. 505, 508-511 (1971).

728 MORGAN v. ILLINOIS

Opinion of the Court
Thus it is that our decisions dealing with capital sentenc-ing juries and presenting issues most analogous to that

which we decide here today, e. g., Witherspoon v. Illinois,391 U. S., at 518; Adams v. Texas, 448 U. S. 38, 40 (1980);
Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U. S. 412, 423 (1985); Ross v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S., at 85, have relied on the strictures dictatedby the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to ensure the impartiality of any jury that will undertake capital sentencing.See also Turner v. Murray, 476 U. S. 28, 36, and n. 9 (1986)
(plurality opinion). B

Witt held that "the proper standard for determining whena prospective juror may be excluded for cause because of his
or her views on capital punishment . . . is whether the juror'sviews would `prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instruc-tions and his oath.' " 469 U. S., at 424 (quoting

Adams v.Texas, supra, at 45). Under this standard, it is clear from

Witt and Adams, the progeny of Witherspoon, that a jurorwho in no case would vote for capital punishment, regardless
of his or her instructions, is not an impartial juror and mustbe removed for cause.

Thereafter, in Ross v. Oklahoma, supra, a state trial courtrefused to remove for cause a juror who declared he would
vote to impose death automatically if the jury found the de-fendant guilty. That juror, however, was removed by the
defendant's use of a peremptory challenge, and for that rea-son the death sentence could be affirmed. But in the course
of reaching this result, we announced our considered viewthat because the Constitution guarantees a defendant on
trial for his life the right to an impartial jury, 487 U. S., at85, the trial court's failure to remove the juror for cause was
constitutional error under the standard enunciated in Witt.We emphasized that "[h]ad [this juror] sat on the jury that
ultimately sentenced petitioner to death, and had petitionerproperly preserved his right to challenge the trial court's

Opinion of the Court
failure to remove [the juror] for cause, the sentence wouldhave to be overturned." 487 U. S., at 85 (citing Adams,

supra).We reiterate this view today. A juror who will automatically vote for the death penalty in every case will fail in goodfaith to consider the evidence of aggravating and mitigating
circumstances as the instructions require him to do. In-deed, because such a juror has already formed an opinion on
the merits, the presence or absence of either aggravating ormitigating circumstances is entirely irrelevant to such a
juror. Therefore, based on the requirement of impartialityembodied in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment, a capital defendant may challenge for cause anyprospective juror who maintains such views. If even one
such juror is empaneled and the death sentence is imposed,the State is disentitled to execute the sentence.

C
Illinois, in fact, raises no challenge to the foregoing pre-cepts, but argues instead that the trial court, in its discretion, may refuse direct inquiry into this matter, so long asits other questioning purports to assure the defendant a fair
and impartial jury able to follow the law. It is true that"

[v]oir dire `is conducted under the supervision of the court,and a great deal must, of necessity, be left to its sound discretion.' " Ristaino v. Ross, 424 U. S. 589, 594 (1976) (quotingConnors v. United States, 158 U. S. 408, 413 (1895)). The
Constitution, after all, does not dictate a catechism for voirdire, but only that the defendant be afforded an impartial
jury. Even so, part of the guarantee of a defendant's rightto an impartial jury is an adequate

voir dire to identifyunqualified jurors. Dennis v. United States, 339 U. S. 162,

171-172 (1950); Morford v. United States, 339 U. S. 258, 259(1950). "Voir dire plays a critical function in assuring the
criminal defendant that his [constitutional] right to an impar-tial jury will be honored. Without an adequate voir dire the

trial judge's responsibility to remove prospective jurors whowill not be able impartially to follow the court's instructions

and evaluate the evidence cannot be fulfilled." RosalesLopez v. United States, 451 U. S. 182, 188 (1981) (plurality
opinion). Hence, "[t]he exercise of [the trial court's] discretion, and the restriction upon inquiries at the request ofcounsel, [are] subject to the essential demands of fairness."

Aldridge v. United States, 283 U. S. 308, 310 (1931).5The adequacy of

voir dire is not easily the subject of appellate review, Rosales-Lopez, supra, at 188, but we have nothesitated, particularly in capital cases, to find that certain

inquiries must be made to effectuate constitutional protections, see, e. g., Turner v. Murray, supra, at 36-37; Ham v.
South Carolina, 409 U. S. 524, 526-527 (1973). Our holding
in Ham, for instance, was as follows:

"Since one of the purposes of the Due Process Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment is to insure these `essential
demands of fairness,' e. g., Lisenba v. California, 314
U. S. 219, 236 (1941), and since a principal purpose of the
adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment was to prohibit
the States from invidiously discriminating on the basis
of race, Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 81 (1873),
we think that the Fourteenth Amendment required the
judge in this case to interrogate the jurors upon the
subject of racial prejudice. South Carolina law permits
challenges for cause, and authorizes the trial judge to
conduct voir dire examination of potential jurors. The
State having created this statutory framework for the
selection of juries, the essential fairness required by the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that under the facts shown by this record the

5 See Mu'Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415, 425-426 (1991): "To be constitutionally compelled . . . it is not enough that such questions might be helpful.
Rather, the trial court's failure to ask these questions must render the
defendant's trial fundamentally unfair."

Opinion of the Court
petitioner be permitted to have the jurors interrogatedon the issue of racial bias." Id., at 526-527.

We have also come to recognize that the principles firstpropounded in Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510 (1968),
the reverse of which are at issue here, demand inquiry intowhether the views of prospective jurors on the death penalty
would disqualify them from sitting.6 At its inception, With-erspoon conferred no "right" on a State, but was in reality a
limitation of a State's making unlimited challenges for causeto exclude those jurors who "might hesitate" to return a verdict imposing death. Id., at 512-513; see Adams v. Texas,448 U. S., at 47-49. Upon consideration of the jury in

With-erspoon, drawn as it was from a venire from which the State

struck any juror expressing qualms about the death penalty,

6 Illinois argues that, because of the changed structure in death penalty
jurisprudence since Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972), Witherspoon
principles should no longer guide this area. But analogous arguments
have been previously raised and rejected. Adams v. Texas, 448 U. S. 38,
45-47 (1980). When considering the Texas death penalty scheme in light
of Witherspoon, we stated: "[J]urors in Texas must determine whether
the evidence presented by the State convinces them beyond reasonable
doubt that each of the three questions put to them must be answered in
the affirmative. In doing so, they must consider both aggravating and
mitigating circumstances, whether appearing in the evidence presented at
the trial on guilt or innocence or during the sentencing proceedings. Jurors will characteristically know that affirmative answers to the questions
will result in the automatic imposition of the death penalty, and each of
the jurors whose exclusion is challenged by petitioner was so informed.
In essence, Texas juries must be allowed to consider `on the basis of all
relevant evidence not only why a death sentence should be imposed, but
also why it should not be imposed.' Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262, 271
(1976) (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). This process is not
an exact science, and the jurors under the Texas bifurcated procedure
unavoidably exercise a range of judgment and discretion while remaining
true to their instructions and their oaths." Adams, supra, at 46 (citation
omitted). The balancing approach chosen by Illinois vests considerably
more discretion in the jurors considering the death penalty, and, with
stronger reason, Witherspoon's general principles apply. Cf. Turner v.
Murray, 476 U. S. 28, 34-35 (1986) (plurality opinion).

732 MORGAN v. ILLINOIS

Opinion of the Court
we found it "self-evident that, in its role as arbiter of the
punishment to be imposed, this jury fell woefully short of
that impartiality to which the petitioner was entitled under
the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments." 391 U. S., at 518.
To preserve this impartiality, Witherspoon constrained the
State's exercise of challenges for cause:

"[A] State may not entrust the determination of whether
a man should live or die to a tribunal organized to return
a verdict of death. Specifically, we hold that a sentence
of death cannot be carried out if the jury that imposed
or recommended it was chosen by excluding veniremen
for cause simply because they voiced general objections
to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction. No defendant can
constitutionally be put to death at the hands of a tribunal so selected." Id., at 520-523 (footnotes omitted).

See also Lockhart v. McCree, 476 U. S. 162, 179-180 (1986).
Witherspoon limited a State's power broadly to exclude jurors hesitant in their ability to sentence a defendant to death,
but nothing in that decision questioned "the power of a State
to execute a defendant sentenced to death by a jury from
which the only veniremen who were in fact excluded for
cause were those who made unmistakably clear . . . that they
would automatically vote against the imposition of capital
punishment without regard to any evidence that might be
developed at the trial of the case before them . . . ." 391
U. S., at 522, n. 21 (emphasis in original); see also id., at
513-514.

In Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U. S. 412 (1985), we revisited
footnote 21 of Witherspoon, and held affirmatively that
"the State may exclude from capital sentencing juries that
`class' of veniremen whose views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of their duties in accord504us2$91K 04-08-96 07:15:12 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ance with their instructions or their oaths." 469 U. S., at
424, n. 5; see also Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 595-596
(1978). Indeed, in Lockhart v. McCree we thereafter spoke
in terms of " `Witherspoon-excludables' " whose removal for
cause "serves the State's entirely proper interest in obtaining a single jury that could impartially decide all of the issues in [a capital] case." 476 U. S., at 180. From Witt,
moreover, it was but a very short step to observe as well
in Lockhart:

"[T]he State may challenge for cause prospective jurors
whose opposition to the death penalty is so strong that
it would prevent them from impartially determining a
capital defendant's guilt or innocence. Ipso facto, the
State must be given the opportunity to identify such
prospective jurors by questioning them at voir dire
about their views of the death penalty." 476 U. S., at
170, n. 7.

This passage in Lockhart expanded but briefly upon what
we had already recognized in Witt: "As with any other trial
situation where an adversary wishes to exclude a juror because of bias, then, it is the adversary seeking exclusion who
must demonstrate, through questioning, that the potential
juror lacks impartiality. It is then the trial judge's duty to
determine whether the challenge is proper." 469 U. S., at
423 (citation omitted; emphasis added).

We deal here with petitioner's ability to exercise intelligently his complementary challenge for cause against those
biased persons on the venire who as jurors would unwaveringly impose death after a finding of guilt. Were voir dire
not available to lay bare the foundation of petitioner's challenge for cause against those prospective jurors who would
always impose death following conviction, his right not to
be tried by such jurors would be rendered as nugatory and

meaningless as the State's right, in the absence of question-ing, to strike those who would never do so.

D
The only issue remaining is whether the questions pro-pounded by the trial court were sufficient to satisfy petitioner's right to make inquiry. As noted above, Illinois suggeststhat general fairness and "follow the law" questions, of the
like employed by the trial court here, are enough to detectthose in the venire who automatically would vote for the
death penalty.8 The State's own request for questioningunder

Witherspoon and Witt of course belies this argument.Witherspoon and its succeeding cases would be in large

measure superfluous were this Court convinced that suchgeneral inquiries could detect those jurors with views pre7 As the Fifth Circuit has observed obiter dictum: "All veniremen are
potentially biased. The process of voir dire is designed to cull from the
venire persons who demonstrate that they cannot be fair to either side of
the case. Clearly, the extremes must be eliminated--i. e., those who, in
spite of the evidence, would automatically vote to convict or impose the
death penalty or automatically vote to acquit or impose a life sentence."
Smith v. Balkcom, 660 F. 2d 573, 578 (1981) (emphasis in original), modified, 671 F. 2d 858, cert. denied, 459 U. S. 882 (1982).

8 Almost in passing the State also suggests that the "reverseWitherspoon" inquiry is inapposite because of a putative "quantitative difference." Illinois requires a unanimous verdict in favor of imposing
death, see supra, at 721-722; thus any one juror can nullify the imposition
of the death penalty. "Persons automatically for the death penalty would
not carry the same weight," Illinois argues, "because persons automatically for the death penalty would still need to persuade the remaining
eleven jurors to vote for the death penalty." Brief for Respondent 27.
The dissent chooses to champion this argument, post, at 750, although it
is clearly foreclosed by Ross v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 81, 85 (1988), where
we held that even one such juror on the panel would be one too many.
See supra, at 728-729. In any event, the measure of a jury is taken by
reference to the impartiality of each, individual juror. Illinois has chosen
to provide a capital defendant 12 jurors to decide his fate, and each of
these jurors must stand equally impartial in his or her ability to follow
the law.

venting or substantially impairing their duties in accordancewith their instructions and oath. But such jurors--whether

they be unalterably in favor of, or opposed to, the death pen-alty in every case--by definition are ones who cannot perform their duties in accordance with law, their protestationsto the contrary notwithstanding.

As to general questions of fairness and impartiality, suchjurors could in all truth and candor respond affirmatively,
personally confident that such dogmatic views are fair andimpartial, while leaving the specific concern unprobed.
More importantly, however, the belief that death should beimposed

ipso facto upon conviction of a capital offense re-flects directly on that individual's inability to follow the law.

See supra, at 729. Any juror who would impose death re-gardless of the facts and circumstances of conviction cannot
follow the dictates of law. See Turner v. Murray, 476 U. S.,at 34-35 (plurality opinion). It may be that a juror could,
in good conscience, swear to uphold the law and yet be un-aware that maintaining such dogmatic beliefs about the
death penalty would prevent him or her from doing so.9 Adefendant on trial for his life must be permitted on voir dire

9 That certain prospective jurors maintain such inconsistent beliefs--
that they can follow the law, but that they will always vote to impose
death for conviction of a capital offense--has been demonstrated, even in
this case. See n. 2, supra. Indeed, in Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U. S. 412
(1985), we set forth the following exchange, highlighting this inconsistency
in beliefs in regards to Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510 (1968):

"THE COURT: Wait a minute, ma'am. I haven't made up my mind
yet. Just have a seat. Let me ask you these things. Do you have any
prefixed ideas about this case at all?

"[A]: Not at all.
"THE COURT: Will you follow the law that I give you?
"[A]: I could do that.
"THE COURT: What I am concerned about is that you indicated that
you have a state of mind that might make you be unable to follow the law
of this State.

"[A]: I could not bring back a death penalty.

trial, that being whether to impose the death penalty.

Justice Scalia, in dissent, insists that Illinois is entitledto try a death penalty case with 1 or even 12 jurors who

upon inquiry announce that they would automatically vote toimpose the death penalty if the defendant is found guilty
of a capital offense, no matter what the so-called mitigatingfactors, whether statutory or nonstatutory, might be.

Post,at 742-746. But such jurors obviously deem mitigating evidence to be irrelevant to their decision to impose the deathpenalty: They not only refuse to give such evidence any
weight but are also plainly saying that mitigating evidenceis not worth their consideration and that they will not consider it. While Justice Scalia's jaundiced view of our de-cision today may best be explained by his rejection of the
line of cases tracing from Woodson v. North Carolina, 428U. S. 280 (1976), and

Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978), anddeveloping the nature and role of mitigating evidence in the

trial of capital offenses, see Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639,669-673 (1990) (

dence described in this Court's cases. See Turner v. Mur-ray, supra, at 34-35 (plurality opinion).

The Illinois death penalty statute provides that "[t]hecourt shall consider, or shall instruct the jury to consider any
aggravating and any mitigating factors which are relevant tothe imposition of the death penalty," Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38,
|| 9-1(c) (Supp. 1990), and lists certain mitigating factors thatthe legislature must have deemed relevant to such imposition, ibid.10 The statute explicitly directs the procedurecontrolling this jury deliberation:

"If there is a unanimous finding by the jury that one ormore of the factors [enumerated in aggravation] exist,
the jury shall consider aggravating and mitigating fac-tors as instructed by the court and shall determine
whether the sentence of death shall be imposed. If thejury determines unanimously that there are no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude the imposition of thedeath sentence, the court shall sentence the defendant
to death." || 9-1(g).
In accord with this statutory procedure, the trial judge inthis case instructed the jury:

"In deciding whether the Defendant should be sen-tenced to death, you should consider all the aggravating
10 Illinois Rev. Stat., ch. 38, || 9-1(c) (Supp. 1990), provides:
"Mitigating factors may include but need not be limited to the following:
"(1) the defendant has no significant history of prior criminal activity;
"(2) the murder was committed while the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, although not such as to
constitute a defense to prosecution;

"(3) the murdered individual was a participant in the defendant's homicidal conduct or consented to the homicidal act;

"(4) the defendant acted under the compulsion of threat or menace of the
imminent infliction of death or great bodily harm;

"(5) the defendant was not personally present during commission of the
act or acts causing death."

factors supported by the evidence and all the mitigatingfactors supported by the evidence.

. . . . .
"If you unanimously find, from your consideration ofall the evidence, that there are no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude imposition of the death sentence, thenyou should sign the verdict requiring the Court sentence
the Defendant to death." App. 122-123.
Any juror who states that he or she will automatically votefor the death penalty without regard to the mitigating evidence is announcing an intention not to follow the instruc-tions to consider the mitigating evidence and to decide if it is
sufficient to preclude imposition of the death penalty. Anycontrary reading of this instruction, or more importantly, the
controlling statute, renders the term "sufficient" meaning-less. The statute plainly indicates that a lesser sentence is
available in every case where mitigating evidence exists;thus any juror who would invariably impose the death penalty upon conviction cannot be said to have reached thisdecision based on all the evidence. While

Justice Scaliachooses to argue that such a "merciless juro[r]" is not a "lawless" one, post, at 751, he is in error, for such a juror will notgive mitigating evidence the consideration that the statute
contemplates. Indeed, the Illinois Supreme Court recog-nizes that jurors are not impartial if they would automatically vote for the death penalty, and that questioning inthe manner petitioner requests is a direct and helpful means
of protecting a defendant's right to an impartial jury. Seen. 3, supra. The State has not suggested otherwise in this
Court.Surely if in a particular Illinois case the judge, who imposes sentence should the defendant waive his right to jurysentencing under the statute, see n. 1,

supra, was to an-nounce that, to him or her, mitigating evidence is beside the

point and that he or she intends to impose the death penaltywithout regard to the nature or extent of mitigating evidence

if the defendant is found guilty of a capital offense, that judge
is refusing in advance to follow the statutory direction to
consider that evidence and should disqualify himself or herself. Any juror to whom mitigating factors are likewise irrelevant should be disqualified for cause, for that juror has
formed an opinion concerning the merits of the case without
basis in the evidence developed at trial. Accordingly, the
defendant in this case was entitled to have the inquiry made
that he proposed to the trial judge.

IV
Because the "inadequacy of voir dire" leads us to doubt
that petitioner was sentenced to death by a jury empaneled
in compliance with the Fourteenth Amendment, his sentence
cannot stand.11 Turner v. Murray, 476 U. S., at 37. Accordingly, the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court affirming
petitioner's death sentence is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this
opinion.

So ordered.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The Court today holds that a juror who will always impose
the death penalty for capital murder is not "impartial" in the
sense required by the Sixth Amendment; that the Constitution requires that voir dire directed to this specific "bias" be
provided upon the defendant's request; and that the more
general questions about "fairness" and ability to "follow the
law" that were asked during voir dire in this case were inadequate. Because these conclusions seem to me jointly and
severally wrong, I dissent.

Scalia, J., dissenting

I
The Court today reaffirms our oft-repeated holding thatthe Sixth Amendment (which is binding on the States

through the Fourteenth Amendment) does not require a jurytrial at the sentencing phase of a capital case.

Ante, at 726.See Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738, 745-746 (1990);

Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 647-649 (1990); Cabana v.Bullock, 474 U. S. 376, 385 (1986); Spaziano v. Florida, 468
U. S. 447, 464 (1984); see also McMillan v. Pennsylvania,477 U. S. 79, 93 (1986) (no right to jury sentencing in noncapital case). In a separate line of cases, however, we have saidthat the exclusion of persons who merely "express serious
reservations about capital punishment" from sentencing ju-ries violates the right to an "

impartial jury" under the SixthAmendment. Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510, 518

(1968); see also Adams v. Texas, 448 U. S. 38, 40 (1980); Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U. S. 412, 423 (1985). The two proposi-tions are, of course, contradictory: If capital sentencing is not

subject to the Sixth Amendment jury guarantee, then nei-ther is it subject to the subsidiary requirement that the requisite jury be impartial.The Court effectively concedes that the Sixth Amendment
does not apply here, relying instead upon the Due ProcessClause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which it says requires
that any sentencing jury be "impartial" to the same extentthat the Sixth Amendment requires a jury at the guilt phase
to be impartial. Ante, at 727. I agree with that. See
Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349, 358 (1977) (plurality opin-ion) (sentencing procedures must comply with the requirements of the Due Process Clause). I do not agree, however,that unconstitutional "partiality," for either Sixth Amendment or Fourteenth Amendment purposes, is established bythe fact that a juror's standard of judgment--which he applies to the defendant on trial as he would to all others--happens to be the standard least favorable to the defense.
Assume, for example, a criminal prosecution in which the

Scalia, J., dissenting
State plans to prove only elements of circumstantial evidence
x, y, and z. Surely counsel for the defendant cannot establish unconstitutional partiality (and hence obtain mandatoryrecusal) of a juror by getting him to state, on

voir dire, that
if, in a prosecution for this crime, elements x, y, and z were
shown, he would always vote to convict. Such an admissionwould simply demonstrate that particular juror's standard of

judgment regarding how evidence deserves to be weighed--and even though application of that standard will, of a certainty, cause the juror to vote to convict in the case at hand,the juror is not therefore "biased" or "partial" in the constitutionally forbidden sense. So also, it seems to me, with jurors' standards of judgment concerning appropriateness of
the death penalty. The fact that a particular juror thinks
the death penalty proper whenever capital murder is established does not disqualify him. To be sure, the law governing sentencing verdicts says that a jury may give less than
the death penalty in such circumstances, just as, in the hypothetical case I have propounded, the law governing guilt verdicts says that a jury may acquit despite proof of elements
x, y, and z. But in neither case does the requirement that a
more defense-favorable option be left available to the jury
convert into a requirement that all jurors must, on the facts
of the case, be amenable to entertaining that option.

A State in which the jury does the sentencing no more
violates the due process requirement of impartiality by
allowing the seating of jurors who favor the death penalty
than does a State with judge-imposed sentencing by permitting the people to elect (or the executive to appoint) judges
who favor the death penalty. Cf. United States v. Grinnell
Corp., 384 U. S. 563, 583 (1966); United States v. Richards,
737 F. 2d 1307, 1311 (CA4 1984), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 1106

tiality of a judge). Indeed, it is precisely because such indi-vidual juror "biases" are constitutionally permissible that

Witherspoon v. Illinois imposed the limitation that a Statemay not skew the makeup of the jury as a whole by excluding all death-scrupled jurors. 391 U. S., at 519-523.

II
In the Court's view, a juror who will always impose thedeath penalty upon proof of the required aggravating factors 1 "will fail in good faith to consider the evidence of ag-gravating and mitigating circumstances as the instructions

require him to do." Ante, at 729 (emphasis added); see alsoante, at 738-739. I would agree with that if it were true
that the instructions required jurors to deem certain evi-dence to be "mitigating" and to weigh that evidence in deciding the penalty. On that hypothesis, the juror's firm attach-ment to the death penalty would demonstrate an absence of
the constitutionally requisite impartiality, which requiresthat the decisionmaker be able "conscientiously [to] apply the
law and find the facts." Witt, supra, at 423; see also Lockhart v. McCree, 476 U. S. 162, 178 (1986); Adams, supra, at45. The hypothesis, however, is not true as applied to the

facts of the present case. Remarkably, the Court rests its

1 It is important to bear in mind that the juror who will ignore the
requirement of finding an aggravating factor is not at issue here. Petitioner does not contend that the voir dire question he seeks is necessary
because the death-inclined juror will not impartially make the strictly factual determination, at the first stage of Illinois' two-part sentencing procedure, that the defendant is eligible for the death penalty because one of
the statutorily required aggravating factors exists (in this case, the fact
that the murder was a contract killing). Obviously, the standard question
whether the juror can obey the court's instructions is enough to disclose
that difficulty. Petitioner's theory--which the Court accepts, ante, at
735-736--is that the special voir dire question is necessary to identify
those veniremen who, at the second, weighing stage, after having properly
found the aggravating factor, "will never find enough mitigation to preclude imposing death." Brief for Petitioner 8.

judgment upon a juror's inability to comply with instruc-tions, without bothering to describe the key instructions.

When one considers them, it is perfectly clear that they donot preclude a juror from taking the view that, for capital
murder, a death sentence is always warranted.The jury in this case was instructed that "[a]ggravating
factors are reasons why the Defendant should be sentencedto death"; that "[m]itigating factors are reasons why the Defendant should not be sentenced to death"; that the jury must"consider all the aggravating factors supported by the evidence and all the mitigating factors supported by the evi-dence"; and that the jury should impose a death sentence if
it found, "from [its] consideration of all the evidence, thatthere are no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude imposition of a death sentence," App. 122-123.2 The instructionsdid not in any way further define what constitutes a "mitigating" or an "aggravating" factor, other than to point out thatthe jury's finding, at the death-eligibility stage, that petitioner committed a contract killing was necessarily an aggra-vator. As reflected in these instructions, Illinois law permitted each juror to define for himself whether a particularitem of evidence was mitigating, in the sense that it provided
a "reaso[n] why the Defendant should not be sentenced todeath." Thus, it is simply not the case that Illinois law precluded a juror from taking the bright-line position that thereare no valid reasons why a defendant who has committed a
contract killing should not be sentenced to death. Such ajuror does not "fail . . . to consider the evidence,"

2 The Court attaches great weight to the use of the term "sufficient" in
these instructions and in the governing statute. The Court views this
term as implicitly establishing that the jurors must find some mitigation.
(How else, the Court reasons, could the jury determine whether there is
"sufficient" mitigation?) Ante, at 738. The inference is plainly fallacious:
A direction to a person to consider whether there are "sufficient" reasons
to do something does not logically imply that in some circumstance he
must find something to be a "reason," and must find that reason to be
"sufficient."

any mitigating factors which are relevant . . ."); he simplyfails to give it the effect the defendant desires.

Nor can the Court's exclusion of these death-inclined ju-rors be justified on the theory that--regardless of what Illinois law purports to permit--the Eighth Amendment pro-hibits a juror from always advocating a death sentence at
the weighing stage. Our cases in this area hold, not thatthe sentencer

must give effect to (or even that he must con-sider) the evidence offered by the defendant as mitigating,

but rather that he must "not be precluded from considering"it, Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604 (1978) (plurality opinion)
(emphasis added); Bell v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 637, 642 (1978) (plu-rality opinion) (same). See also

3 The Court notes that the Illinois statute lists certain potentially mitigating factors, see Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, || 9-1(c) (Supp. 1990), and therefore concludes that the legislature "must have deemed [them] relevant" to
the imposition of the death penalty. Ante, at 737. It is of course true
that the listed factors are "relevant" in the sense that a juror "may" find
them to be mitigating, || 9-1(c), and also in the sense that the defendant
must be allowed to introduce evidence concerning these factors. But the
statute's permissive and nonexhaustive list clearly does not establish what
the Court needs to show, viz., that jurors must deem these (or some other
factors) to be actually "mitigating." The fact that the jury has the discretion to deem evidence to be mitigating cannot establish that there is an
obligation to do so. Indeed, it is impossible in principle to distinguish
between a juror who does not believe that any factor can be mitigating
from one who believes that a particular factor--e. g., "extreme mental
or emotional disturbance," || 9-1(c)(2)--is not mitigating. (Presumably,
under today's decision a juror who thinks a "bad childhood" is never mitigating must also be excluded.) In any event, in deciding whether to vacate petitioner's sentence on account of juror impartiality--i. e., on the
basis that one or more of petitioner's jurors may have refused to follow
the instructions--we must be guided, not by the instructions that (perhaps) should have been given (a question of state law which we have no
authority to review), but by the instructions that were given.

must be.4 The "conscience of the community," id., at 519,also includes those jurors who are not swayed by mitigating evidence.The Court relies upon dicta contained in our opinion in
Ross v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 81 (1988). Ante, at 728-729.In that case, the defendant challenged for cause a juror who
stated during voir dire that he would automatically vote toimpose a death sentence if the defendant were convicted.
The trial court rejected the challenge, and Ross used a pe-remptory challenge to remove the juror. Although we
noted that the state appellate court had assumed that sucha juror would not be able to follow the law, 487 U. S., at 84-85
(citing Ross v. State, 717 P. 2d 117, 120 (Okla. Crim. App.1986)), we held that Ross was not deprived of an impartial
jury because none of the jurors who actually sat on the petitjury was partial. 487 U. S., at 86-88. In reaching that conclusion, however, we expressed the view that had the chal-lenged juror actually served, "the sentence would have to be
overturned." Id., at 85. The Court attaches great weightto this dictum, which it describes as "announc[ing] our considered view," ante, at 728. This is hyperbole. It is clearon the face of the opinion that the dictum was based entirely
on the fact that the state court had assumed that such a jurorwas unwilling to follow the law at the penalty phase--a point
we did not purport to examine independently. 487 U. S., at84-85. The

Ross dictum thus merely reflects the quite mod-est proposition that a juror who will not follow the law is

not impartial.Because Illinois would not violate due process by seating
a juror who will not be swayed by mitigating evidence at theweighing stage, the Constitution does not entitle petitioner
to identify such jurors during voir dire.

4 The Court's only response to this point is the suggestion that it somehow rests upon my rejecting the Woodson-Lockett line of cases. Ante, at
736. That is not so, as my quotations from over a dozen Woodson-Lockett
cases make painfully clear.

Even if I agreed with the Court, however, that jurors whowill always advocate a death sentence for capital murder are

not "impartial" and must be excused for cause, I would notagree with the further conclusion that the Constitution requires a trial court to make specific inquiries on this subjectduring

voir dire.In Mu'Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415 (1991), we surveyed

our cases concerning the requirements of voir dire and con-cluded that, except where interracial capital crimes are at
issue, trial courts "retai[n] great latitude in deciding whatquestions should be asked on

voir dire," id., at 424; see alsoRistaino v. Ross, 424 U. S. 589, 594 (1976). We emphasized

that our authority to require specific inquiries on voir dire isparticularly narrow with respect to state-court trials, where
we may not exercise supervisory authority and are "limitedto enforcing the commands of the United States Constitution," Mu'Min, 500 U. S., at 422. We concluded, as a generalmatter, that a defendant was entitled to specific questions
only if the failure to ask them would render his trial "funda-mentally unfair,"

id., at 426. Thus, we have held that absentsome "special circumstance," Turner, supra, at 37, a "generalized but thorough inquiry into the impartiality of the veni-remen" is a constitutionally adequate

voir dire. Ristaino,supra, at 598. Finally, we have long acknowledged that, in

light of the credibility determinations involved, a trial court'sfinding that a particular juror is impartial may "be overturned only for `manifest error,' " Patton v. Yount, 467 U. S.1025, 1031 (1984) (quoting Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, 723

(1961)); see also Mu'Min, supra, at 428.Were the Court today extending

Witherspoon's jury-balancing rule so as to require affirmatively that a capital

sentencing jury contain a mix of views on the death penalty,that requirement would of course constitute a "special circumstance" necessitating specific inquiry into the subject onvoir dire. But that is not what petitioner has sought, and it

is not what the Court purports to decree. Its theory, as Ihave described, is that a juror who will always impose the

death penalty for capital murder is one who "will fail in goodfaith to consider the evidence of aggravating and mitigating
circumstances as the instructions require him to do," ante,
at 729 (emphasis added). Even assuming (contrary to thereality) that that theory fits the facts of this case (

i. e., that
the instructions required jurors to be open to voting againstthe death penalty on the basis of allegedly mitigating circumstances), I see no reason why jurors who will defy this ele-ment of the instructions, like jurors who will defy other elements of the instructions, see, e. g., n. 1, supra, cannot be
identified by more general questions concerning fairness and
willingness to follow the law. In the present case, the trial
court on voir dire specifically asked nine of the jurors who
ultimately served whether they would follow the court's instructions even if they disagreed with them, and all nine answered affirmatively. Moreover, all the veniremen were informed of the nature of the case and were instructed that, if
selected, they would be required to follow the court's instructions; subsequently, all 12 jurors responded negatively to a
specific question whether there was any reason why they did
not think they could be fair and impartial in this case.
These questions, which were part of an extensive voir dire,
succeeded in identifying one juror who would be unable to
follow the court's instructions at the penalty phase: The juror
admitted that, because of the anger he felt over the murder
of his friend's parents, his sentiments in favor of the death
penalty were so strong that he did not believe he could be
fair to petitioner at the sentencing hearing. Taking appropriate account of the opportunity for the trial court to observe and evaluate the demeanor of the veniremen, I see no
basis for concluding that its finding that the 12 jurors were
impartial was manifestly erroneous.

The Court provides two reasons why a specific question
must be asked, but neither passes the most gullible scrutiny.

Scalia, J., dissenting
First, the Court states that general questions would be insufficient because "such jurors could in all truth and candor
respond affirmatively, personally confident that such dogmatic views are fair and impartial . . . ." Ante, at 735. In
other words, jurors who would always impose the death penalty would be violating the instructions without realizing
that that is what they are doing. It seems to me quite obvious that solution of this problem does not require a specific
question of each juror, but can be achieved by simply changing the instructions so that these well-intentioned jurors will
understand that an aggravators-always-outweigh-mitigators
view is prohibited. The record does not reflect that petitioner made any objection to the clarity of the instructions
in this regard.

Second, the Court asserts that the adequacy of general
voir dire questions is belied by "[t]he State's own request
for questioning under Witherspoon and Witt." Ante, at 734.
Without such questioning, we are told, "Witherspoon and its
succeeding cases would be in large measure superfluous."
Ibid. But Witherspoon did not, as this reasoning assumes,
give the State a right to exclude jurors ("[I]t is clear beyond
peradventure that Witherspoon is not a ground for challenging any prospective juror," Adams, 448 U. S., at 47-48), and
it is therefore quite impossible that anything we say on that
subject today could render the holding of Witherspoon "superfluous." What the Court describes, ante, at 733, as a
"very short step" from Witherspoon, Adams, and Witt, is in
fact a great leap over an unbridgeable chasm of logic. Witherspoon and succeeding cases held that the State was not constitutionally prevented from excluding jurors who would on
no facts impose death; from which the Court today concludes
that a State is constitutionally compelled to exclude jurors
who would, on the facts establishing the particular aggravated murder, invariably impose death. The Court's argument that because the Constitution requires one it must re504us2$91K 04-08-96 07:15:12 PAGES OPINPGT

quire the other obviously rests on a false premise.5 In anyevent, the mere fact that Illinois sees fit to request one or

another question on voir dire in order to discover one-result-only jurors cannot, as a logical matter, establish that more
general questioning is constitutionally inadequate to dothe job.

For similar reasons, I reject petitioner's argument that itis "fundamentally unfair" to allow Illinois to make specific

discovering (and excluding) those jurors who will alwaysvote in favor of death. Brief for Petitioner 14 (citing

Wardius v. Oregon, 412 U. S. 470 (1973)). Even if it were unfair,of course, the State should be given the option, which today's

opinion does not provide, of abandoning the Witherspoonqualification. (Where the death penalty statute does not
contain a unanimity requirement, I am confident prosecutorswould prefer that to the wholesale elimination of jurors
favoring the death penalty that will be the consequence oftoday's decision.) But in fact there is no unfairness in the
asymmetry. By reason of Illinois' death penalty unanimityrequirement, Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, || 9-1(g) (Supp. 1990), the
practical consequences of allowing the two types of jurors toserve are vastly different: A single death penalty opponent
can block that punishment, but 11 unwavering advocatescannot impose it. And more fundamentally, the asymmetry
is not unfair because, under Illinois law as reflected in the

5 If, as the Court claims, this case truly involved "the reverse" of the
principles established in Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510 (1968), and
the cases following it, ante, at 731, then it is difficult to understand why
petitioner would not be entitled to challenge, not just those jurors who
will "automatically" impose the death penalty, but also those whose sentiments on the subject are sufficiently strong that their faithful service as
jurors will be "substantially impaired"--the reformulated standard we
adopted in Adams v. Texas, 448 U. S. 38 (1980), and Wainwright v. Witt,
469 U. S. 412 (1985). The Court's failure to carry its premise to its logical
conclusion suggests its awareness that the premise is wrong.

statute and instructions in this case, the Witherspoon-disqualified juror is a lawless juror, whereas the juror to be

disqualified under the Court's new rule is not. In the firststage of Illinois' two-part sentencing hearing, jurors must
determine, on the facts, specified aggravating factors, and atthe second, weighing stage, they

must impose the death pen-alty for murder with particular aggravators if they find "no

mitigating factors sufficient to preclude [its] imposition."But whereas the finding of aggravation is mandatory, the
finding of mitigation is optional; what constitutes mitigationis not defined and is left up to the judgment of each juror.
Given that there will always be aggravators to be consideredat the weighing stage, the juror who says he will never vote
for the death penalty, no matter what the facts, is sayingthat he will not apply the law (the classic case of partiality)--
since the facts may show no mitigation. But the juror whosays that he will always vote for the death penalty is

notpromising to be lawless, since there is no case in which he is

by law compelled to find a mitigating fact "sufficiently miti-gating." The people of Illinois have decided, in other words,
that murder with certain aggravators will be punished bydeath, unless the jury chooses to extend mercy. That
scheme complies with our (ever-expanding) death penaltyjurisprudence as it existed yesterday. The Court has, in
effect, now added the new rule that no merciless jurors cansit.

* * *
Sixteen years ago, this Court decreed--by a sheer act ofwill, with no pretense of foundation in constitutional text or

American tradition--that the People (as in We, the People)cannot decree the death penalty, absolutely and categorically,
for any criminal act, even (presumably) genocide; the jurymust always be given the option of extending mercy.

of confusion that is our annually improvised Eighth Amend-ment, "death is different" jurisprudence, the Court strikes a

further blow against the People in its campaign against thedeath penalty. Not only must mercy be allowed, but now

only the merciful may be permitted to sit in judgment.Those who agree with the author of Exodus, or with Immanuel Kant,6 must be banished from American juries--not be-cause the People have so decreed, but because such jurors
do not share the strong penological preferences of this Court.In my view, that not only is not required by the Constitution
of the United States; it grossly offends it.

PATTERSON, TRUSTEE v. SHUMATE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 91-913. Argued April 20, 1992--Decided June 15, 1992
Respondent Shumate was a participant in his employer's pension plan,

which contained the antialienation provision required for tax qualification under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(ERISA). The District Court rejected his contention that his interest
in the plan should be excluded from his bankruptcy estate under

$ 541(c)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, which excludes property of the
debtor that is subject to a restriction on transfer enforceable under "applicable nonbankruptcy law." The court held, inter alia, that the latter
phrase embraces only state law, not federal law such as ERISA, and
that Shumate's interest in the plan did not qualify for protection as a
spendthrift trust under state law. The court ordered that Shumate's
interest in the plan be paid over to petitioner, as trustee of Shumate's
bankruptcy estate. The Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that the interest should be excluded from the bankruptcy estate under $ 541(c)(2).

Held: The plain language of the Bankruptcy Code and ERISA establishes

that an antialienation provision in a qualified pension plan constitutes a
restriction on transfer enforceable under "applicable nonbankruptcy
law" for purposes of $ 541(c)(2). Pp. 757-766.

(a) Plainly read, $ 541(c)(2) encompasses any relevant nonbankruptcy
law, including federal law such as ERISA. The section contains no limitation on "applicable nonbankruptcy law" relating to the source of the
law, and its text nowhere suggests that that phrase refers, as petitioner
contends, exclusively to state law. Other sections in the Bankruptcy
Code reveal that Congress knew how to restrict the scope of applicable
law to "state law" and did so with some frequency. Its use of the
broader phrase "applicable nonbankruptcy law" strongly suggests that
it did not intend to restrict $ 541(c)(2) in the manner petitioner contends. Pp. 757-759.

(b) The antialienation provision contained in this ERISA-qualified
plan satisfies the literal terms of $ 541(c)(2). The sections of ERISA
and the Internal Revenue Code requiring a plan to provide that benefits
may not be assigned or alienated clearly impose a "restriction on the
transfer" of a debtor's "beneficial interest" within $ 541(c)(2)'s meaning,
and the terms of the plan provision in question comply with those requirements. Moreover, the transfer restrictions are "enforceable," as

754 PATTERSON v. SHUMATE

Syllabus
required by $ 541(c)(2), since ERISA gives participants the right to sue
to enjoin acts that violate that statute or the plan's terms. Pp. 759-760.

(c) Given the clarity of the statutory text, petitioner bears an "exceptionally heavy" burden of persuasion that Congress intended to limit
the $ 541(c)(2) exclusion to restrictions on transfer that are enforceable
only under state spendthrift trust law. Union Bank v. Wolas, 502 U. S.
151, 155-156. He has not satisfied that burden, since his several challenges to the Court's interpretation of $ 541(c)(2)--that it is refuted by
contemporaneous legislative materials, that it renders superfluous the

$ 522(d)(10)(E) debtor's exemption for pension payments, and that it
frustrates the Bankruptcy Code's policy of ensuring a broad inclusion of
assets in the bankruptcy estate--are unpersuasive. Pp. 760-765.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Bankruptcy Code excludes from the bankruptcy es-tate property of the debtor that is subject to a restriction on

transfer enforceable under "applicable nonbankruptcy law."11 U. S. C. $ 541(c)(2). We must decide in this case whether
an antialienation provision contained in an ERISA-qualifiedpension plan constitutes a restriction on transfer enforceable
under "applicable nonbankruptcy law," and whether, accord-ingly, a debtor may exclude his interest in such a plan from
the property of the bankruptcy estate.

I
Respondent Joseph B. Shumate, Jr., was employed for over30 years by Coleman Furniture Corporation, where he ultimately attained the position of president and chairman of theboard of directors. Shumate and approximately 400 other
employees were participants in the Coleman Furniture Cor-poration Pension Plan (Plan). The Plan satisfied all applicable requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Secu-rity Act of 1974 (ERISA) and qualified for favorable tax
treatment under the Internal Revenue Code. In particular,Article 16.1 of the Plan contained the antialienation provision
required for qualification under $ 206(d)(1) of ERISA, 29U. S. C. $ 1056(d)(1) ("Each pension plan shall provide that
benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned oralienated"). App. 342. Shumate's interest in the Plan was
valued at $250,000. Id., at 93-94.In 1982, Coleman Furniture filed a petition for bankruptcy
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The case wasconverted to a Chapter 7 proceeding, and a trustee, Roy V.
Creasy, was appointed. Shumate himself encountered fi-nancial difficulties and filed a petition for bankruptcy in 1984.
His case, too, was converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding, andpetitioner John R. Patterson was appointed trustee.

Creasy terminated and liquidated the Plan, providing fulldistributions to all participants except Shumate. Patterson

Opinion of the Court
then filed an adversary proceeding against Creasy in theBankruptcy Court for the Western District of Virginia to

recover Shumate's interest in the Plan for the benefit ofShumate's bankruptcy estate. Shumate in turn asked the
United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, which already had jurisdiction over a related proceed-ing, to compel Creasy to pay Shumate's interest in the Plan

directly to him. The bankruptcy proceeding subsequentlywas consolidated with the District Court action. App. to
Pet. for Cert. 53a-54a.The District Court rejected Shumate's contention that his
interest in the Plan should be excluded from his bankruptcy
estate. The court held that $ 541(c)(2)'s reference to "nonbankruptcy law" embraced only state law, not federal law
such as ERISA. Creasy v. Coleman Furniture Corp., 83
B. R. 404, 406 (1988). Applying Virginia law, the court held
that Shumate's interest in the Plan did not qualify for protection as a spendthrift trust. Id., at 406-409. The District
Court also rejected Shumate's alternative argument that
even if his interest in the Plan could not be excluded from
the bankruptcy estate under $ 541(c)(2), he was entitled to an
exemption under 11 U. S. C. $ 522(b)(2)(A), which allows a
debtor to exempt from property of the estate "any property
that is exempt under Federal law." 83 B. R., at 409-410.
The District Court ordered Creasy to pay Shumate's interest
in the Plan over to his bankruptcy estate. App. to Pet. for
Cert. 54a-55a.

The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed.
943 F. 2d 362 (1991). The court relied on its earlier decision
in In re Moore, 907 F. 2d 1476 (1990), in which another
Fourth Circuit panel was described as holding, subsequent
to the District Court's decision in the instant case, that
"ERISA-qualified plans, which by definition have a nonalienation provision, constitute `applicable nonbankruptcy
law' and contain enforceable restrictions on the transfer of
pension interests." 943 F. 2d, at 365. Thus, the Court of

Opinion of the Court
Appeals held that Shumate's interest in the Plan should be
excluded from the bankruptcy estate under $ 541(c)(2). Ibid.
The court then declined to consider Shumate's alternative
argument that his interest in the Plan qualified for exemption under $ 522(b). Id., at 365-366.

We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 1057 (1992), to resolve
the conflict among the Courts of Appeals as to whether an
antialienation provision in an ERISA-qualified pension plan
constitutes a restriction on transfer enforceable under "applicable nonbankruptcy law" for purposes of the $ 541(c)(2)
exclusion of property from the debtor's bankruptcy estate.1

II

A

In our view, the plain language of the Bankruptcy Code
and ERISA is our determinant. See Toibb v. Radloff, 501
U. S. 157, 160 (1991). Section 541(c)(2) provides the following exclusion from the otherwise broad definition of "property of the estate" contained in $ 541(a)(1) of the Code:

"A restriction on the transfer of a beneficial interest of
the debtor in a trust that is enforceable under applicable
nonbankruptcy law is enforceable in a case under this
title." (Emphasis added.)

758 PATTERSON v. SHUMATE

Opinion of the Court
The natural reading of the provision entitles a debtor to ex-clude from property of the estate any interest in a plan or

trust that contains a transfer restriction enforceable underany relevant nonbankruptcy law. Nothing in $ 541 suggests
that the phrase "applicable nonbankruptcy law" refers, aspetitioner contends, exclusively to

state law. The text con-tains no limitation on "applicable nonbankruptcy law" relating to the source of the law.Reading the term "applicable nonbankruptcy law" in

$ 541(c)(2) to include federal as well as state law comportswith other references in the Bankruptcy Code to sources of
law. The Code reveals, significantly, that Congress, when itdesired to do so, knew how to restrict the scope of applicable
law to "state law" and did so with some frequency. See, e. g.,11 U. S. C. $ 109(c)(2) (entity may be a debtor under chapter 9
if authorized "by State law"); $ 522(b)(1) (election of exemp-tions controlled by "the State law that is applicable to the
debtor"); $ 523(a)(5) (a debt for alimony, maintenance, orsupport determined "in accordance with State or territorial
law" is not dischargeable); $ 903(1) ("[A] State law prescrib-ing a method of composition of indebtedness" of municipalities is not binding on nonconsenting creditors); see also$$ 362(b)(12) and 1145(a). Congress' decision to use the
broader phrase "applicable nonbankruptcy law" in $ 541(c)(2)strongly suggests that it did not intend to restrict the provision in the manner that petitioner contends.2

2 The phrase "applicable nonbankruptcy law" appears elsewhere in the
Code, and courts have construed those references to include federal law.
See, e. g., 11 U. S. C. $ 1125(d) (adequacy of disclosure statement not governed by any "otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law"); In re Stanley
Hotel, Inc., 13 B. R. 926, 931 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Colo. 1981) ($ 1125(d) includes
federal securities law); 11 U. S. C. $ 108(a) (referring to statute of limitations fixed by "applicable nonbankruptcy law"); In re Ahead By a Length,
Inc., 100 B. R. 157, 162-163 (Bkrtcy. Ct. SDNY 1989) ($ 108(a) includes
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act); Motor Carrier
Audit & Collection Co. v. Lighting Products, Inc., 113 B. R. 424, 425-426
(ND Ill. 1989) ($ 108(a) includes Interstate Commerce Act); 11 U. S. C.

759Cite as: 504 U. S. 753 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
The text of $ 541(c)(2) does not support petitioner's conten-tion that "applicable nonbankruptcy law" is limited to state

law. Plainly read, the provision encompasses any relevantnonbankruptcy law, including federal law such as ERISA.
We must enforce the statute according to its terms. See
United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235,241 (1989).

B
Having concluded that "applicable nonbankruptcy law" isnot limited to state law, we next determine whether the antialienation provision contained in the ERISA-qualified Planat issue here satisfies the literal terms of $ 541(c)(2).

Section 206(d)(1) of ERISA, which states that "[e]ach pen-sion plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan
may not be assigned or alienated," 29 U. S. C. $ 1056(d)(1),clearly imposes a "restriction on the transfer" of a debtor's
"beneficial interest" in the trust. The coordinate section ofthe Internal Revenue Code, 26 U. S. C. $ 401(a)(13), states as
a general rule that "[a] trust shall not constitute a qualifiedtrust under this section unless the plan of which such trust
is a part provides that benefits provided under the plan maynot be assigned or alienated," and thus contains similar restrictions. See also 26 CFR $ 1.401(a)-13(b)(1) (1991).Coleman Furniture's pension plan complied with these requirements. Article 16.1 of the Plan specifically stated: "Nobenefit, right or interest" of any participant "shall be subject

$ 108(b) (referring to time for filing pleadings, notices, etc., fixed by "applicable nonbankruptcy law"); Eagle-Picher Industries, Inc. v. United States,
290 U. S. App. D. C. 307, 321-322, 937 F. 2d 625, 639-640 (1991) ($ 108(b)
includes Federal Tort Claims Act). Although we express no view on the
correctness of these decisions, we note that our construction of $ 541(c)(2)'s
reference to "applicable nonbankruptcy law" as including federal law accords with prevailing interpretations of that phrase as it appears elsewhere in the Code. See Morrison-Knudsen Constr. Co. v. Director, Office
of Workers' Compensation Programs, 461 U. S. 624, 633 (1983) (recognizing principle "that a word is presumed to have the same meaning in all
subsections of the same statute").

Opinion of the Court
to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge,
encumbrance or charge, seizure, attachment or other legal,
equitable or other process." App. 342.

Moreover, these transfer restrictions are "enforceable," as
required by $ 541(c)(2). Plan trustees or fiduciaries are required under ERISA to discharge their duties "in accordance
with the documents and instruments governing the plan."
29 U. S. C. $ 1104(a)(1)(D). A plan participant, beneficiary, or
fiduciary, or the Secretary of Labor may file a civil action to
"enjoin any act or practice" which violates ERISA or the
terms of the plan. $$ 1132(a)(3) and (5). Indeed, this Court
itself vigorously has enforced ERISA's prohibition on the assignment or alienation of pension benefits, declining to recognize any implied exceptions to the broad statutory bar. See
Guidry v. Sheet Metal Workers Nat. Pension Fund, 493 U. S.
365 (1990).3

The antialienation provision required for ERISA qualification and contained in the Plan at issue in this case thus
constitutes an enforceable transfer restriction for purposes
of $ 541(c)(2)'s exclusion of property from the bankruptcy
estate.

III

Petitioner raises several challenges to this conclusion.
Given the clarity of the statutory text, however, he bears an
"exceptionally heavy" burden of persuading us that Congress
intended to limit the $ 541(c)(2) exclusion to restrictions on
transfer that are enforceable only under state spendthrift
trust law. Union Bank v. Wolas, 502 U. S. 151, 155-156
(1991).

3 The Internal Revenue Service at least on occasion has espoused the
view that the transfer of a beneficiary's interest in a pension plan to a
bankruptcy trustee would disqualify the plan from taking advantage of
the preferential tax treatment available under ERISA. See McLean v.
Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas Pension Fund, 762 F. 2d
1204, 1206 (CA4 1985); see also In re Moore, 907 F. 2d, at 1481.

Opinion of the Court

A
Petitioner first contends that contemporaneous legislativematerials demonstrate that $ 541(c)(2)'s exclusion of property

from the bankruptcy estate should not extend to a debtor'sinterest in an ERISA-qualified pension plan. Although
courts "appropriately may refer to a statute's legislative his-tory to resolve statutory ambiguity,"

Toibb v. Radloff, 501U. S., at 162, the clarity of the statutory language at issue in

this case obviates the need for any such inquiry. See ibid.;
United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S., at241; Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803, 809,

n. 3 (1989).4Even were we to consider the legislative materials to
which petitioner refers, however, we could discern no"clearly expressed legislative intention" contrary to the result reached above. See Consumer Product Safety Comm'nv. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U. S. 102, 108 (1980). In his
brief, petitioner quotes from House and Senate Reports ac-companying the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 that purportedly reflect "unmistakable" congressional intent to limit$ 541(c)(2)'s exclusion to pension plans that qualify under
state law as spendthrift trusts. Brief for Petitioner 38.Those reports contain only the briefest of discussions addressing $ 541(c)(2). The House Report states: "Paragraph(2) of subsection (c) . . . preserves restrictions on transfer
of a spendthrift trust to the extent that the restriction isenforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law." H. R.
Rep. No. 95-595, p. 369 (1977); see also S. Rep. No. 95-989,p. 83 (1978) ($ 541(c)(2) "preserves restrictions on a transfer
of a spendthrift trust"). A general introductory section to

4 Those Courts of Appeals that have limited "applicable nonbankruptcy
law" to state spendthrift trust law by ignoring the plain language of

$ 541(c)(2) and relying on isolated excerpts from the legislative history
thus have misconceived the appropriate analytical task. See, e. g., In re
Daniel, 771 F. 2d, at 1359-1360; In re Lichstrahl, 750 F. 2d, at 1490; In re
Graham, 726 F. 2d, at 1271-1272; In re Goff, 706 F. 2d, at 581-582.

504us2$92F 04-06-96 16:07:42 PAGES OPINPGT
762 PATTERSON v. SHUMATE

Opinion of the Court
the House Report contains the additional statement that thenew law "continues over the exclusion from property of the

estate of the debtor's interest in a spendthrift trust to theextent the trust is protected from creditors under applicable
State law." H. R. Rep. No. 95-595, p. 176. These meagerexcerpts reflect at best congressional intent to

include statespendthrift trust law within the meaning of "applicable nonbankruptcy law." By no means do they provide a sufficientbasis for concluding, in derogation of the statute's clear language, that Congress intended to exclude other state andfederal law from the provision's scope.

B
Petitioner next contends that our construction of$ 541(c)(2), pursuant to which a debtor may exclude his interest in an ERISA-qualified pension plan from the bankruptcyestate, renders $ 522(d)(10)(E) of the Bankruptcy Code superfluous. Brief for Petitioner 24-33. Under $ 522(d)(10)(E), adebtor who elects the federal exemptions set forth in $ 522(d)
may exempt from the bankruptcy estate his right to receive"a payment under a stock bonus, pension, profitsharing, annuity, or similar plan or contract . . . , to the extent reason-ably necessary for the support of the debtor and any dependent of the debtor." If a debtor's interest in a pension plancould be excluded in full from the bankruptcy estate, the
argument goes, then there would have been no reason forCongress to create a limited exemption for such interests
elsewhere in the statute.Petitioner's surplusage argument fails, however, for the
reason that $ 522(d)(10)(E) exempts from the bankruptcyestate a much broader category of interests than $ 541(c)(2)
excludes. For example, pension plans established bygovernmental entities and churches need not comply with
Subchapter I of ERISA, including the antialienation re-quirement of $ 206(d)(1). See 29 U. S. C. $$ 1003(b)(1) and (2);
26 CFR $ 1.401(a)-13(a) (1991). So, too, pension plans that

Opinion of the Court
qualify for preferential tax treatment under 26 U. S. C. $ 408(individual retirement accounts) are specifically excepted

from ERISA's antialienation requirement. See 29 U. S. C.$ 1051(6). Although a debtor's interest in these plans could
not be excluded under $ 541(c)(2) because the plans lacktransfer restrictions enforceable under "applicable nonbankruptcy law," that interest 5 nevertheless could be exemptedunder $ 522(d)(10)(E).

6 Once petitioner concedes that

$ 522(d)(10)(E)'s exemption applies to more than ERISA-qualified plans containing antialienation provisions, see Tr.

of Oral Arg. 10-11; Brief for Petitioner 31, his argument thatour reading of $ 541(c)(2) renders the exemption provision
superfluous must collapse. C

Finally, petitioner contends that our holding frustrates theBankruptcy Code's policy of ensuring a broad inclusion of
assets in the bankruptcy estate. See id., at 37; 11 U. S. C.$ 541(a)(1) (estate composed of "all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement ofthe case"). As an initial matter, we think that petitioner

5 We express no opinion on the separate question whether $ 522(d)(10)(E)
applies only to distributions from a pension plan that a debtor has an
immediate and present right to receive, or to the entire undistributed corpus of a pension trust. See, e. g., In re Harline, 950 F. 2d, at 675; Velis v.
Kardanis, 949 F. 2d, at 81-82. See also Arnopol, Including Retirement
Benefits in a Debtor's Bankruptcy Estate: A Proposal for Harmonizing
ERISA and the Bankruptcy Code, 56 Mo. L. Rev. 491, 535-536 (1991).

6 Even those courts that would have limited $ 541(c)(2) to state law acknowledge the breadth of the $ 522(d)(10)(E) exemption. See In re Goff,
706 F. 2d, at 587 (noting that $ 522(d)(10)(E) "reaches a broad array of
employment benefits, and exempts both qualified and unqualified pension
plans") (footnote omitted); In re Graham, 726 F. 2d, at 1272 (observing
that "the $ 522(d)(10)(E) exemption would apply to non-ERISA plans as
well as to qualified ERISA plans"). See also Arnopol, 56 Mo. L. Rev., at

504us2$92F 04-06-96 16:07:42 PAGES OPINPGT
764 PATTERSON v. SHUMATE

Opinion of the Court
mistakes an admittedly broad definition of includable property for a "policy" underlying the Code as a whole. In any
event, to the extent that policy considerations are even relevant where the language of the statute is so clear, we believe
that our construction of $ 541(c)(2) is preferable to the one
petitioner urges upon us.

First, our decision today ensures that the treatment of
pension benefits will not vary based on the beneficiary's
bankruptcy status. See Butner v. United States, 440 U. S.
48, 55 (1979) (observing that "[u]niform treatment of property interests" prevents "a party from receiving `a windfall
merely by reason of the happenstance of bankruptcy,' " quoting Lewis v. Manufacturers National Bank, 364 U. S. 603,
609 (1961)). We previously have declined to recognize any
exceptions to ERISA's antialienation provision outside the
bankruptcy context. See Guidry v. Sheet Metal Workers
Nat. Pension Fund, 493 U. S. 365 (1990) (labor union may
not impose constructive trust on pension benefits of union
official who breached fiduciary duties and embezzled funds).
Declining to recognize any exceptions to that provision
within the bankruptcy context minimizes the possibility that
creditors will engage in strategic manipulation of the bankruptcy laws in order to gain access to otherwise inaccessible
funds. See Seiden, Chapter 7 Cases: Do ERISA and the
Bankruptcy Code Conflict as to Whether a Debtor's Interest
in or Rights Under a Qualified Plan Can be Used to Pay
Claims?, 61 Am. Bankr. L. J. 301, 317 (1987) (noting inconsistency if "a creditor could not reach a debtor-participant's
plan right or interest in a garnishment or other collection
action outside of a bankruptcy case but indirectly could reach
the plan right or interest by filing a petition . . . to place the
debtor in bankruptcy involuntarily").

Our holding also gives full and appropriate effect to
ERISA's goal of protecting pension benefits. See 29 U. S. C.

$$ 1001(b) and (c). This Court has described that goal as one

765Cite as: 504 U. S. 753 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
of ensuring that "if a worker has been promised a definedpension benefit upon retirement--and if he has fulfilled

whatever conditions are required to obtain a vested benefit--he actually will receive it." Nachman Corp. v. Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 446 U. S. 359, 375 (1980).In furtherance of these principles, we recently declined in
Guidry, notwithstanding strong equitable considerations tothe contrary, to recognize an implied exception to ERISA's
antialienation provision that would have allowed a laborunion to impose a constructive trust on the pension benefits
of a corrupt union official. We explained:

"Section 206(d) reflects a considered congressional policychoice, a decision to safeguard a stream of income for

pensioners (and their dependents, who may be, andperhaps usually are, blameless), even if that decision
prevents others from securing relief for the wrongsdone them. If exceptions to this policy are to be made,
it is for Congress to undertake that task." 493 U. S.,at 376.

These considerations apply with equal, if not greater, forcein the present context.

Finally, our holding furthers another important policyunderlying ERISA: uniform national treatment of pension
benefits. See Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U. S.1, 9 (1987). Construing "applicable nonbankruptcy law" to
include federal law ensures that the security of a debtor'spension benefits will be governed by ERISA, not left to the
vagaries of state spendthrift trust law.

IV
In light of our conclusion that a debtor's interest in anERISA-qualified pension plan may be excluded from the

property of the bankruptcy estate pursuant to $ 541(c)(2),we need not reach respondent's alternative argument that

Scalia, J., concurring
his interest in the Plan qualifies for exemption under$ 522(b)(2)(A).

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia, concurring.
The Court's opinion today, which I join, prompts severalobservations.

When the phrase "applicable nonbankruptcy law" is con-sidered in isolation, the phenomenon that three Courts of
Appeals could have thought it a synonym for "state law" ismystifying. When the phrase is considered together with
the rest of the Bankruptcy Code (in which Congress choseto refer to state law as, logically enough, "state law"), the
phenomenon calls into question whether our legal culture has
so far departed from attention to text, or is so lacking inagreed-upon methodology for creating and interpreting text,

that it any longer makes sense to talk of "a government of
laws, not of men."

Speaking of agreed-upon methodology: It is good that the
Court's analysis today proceeds on the assumption that use
of the phrases "state law" and "applicable nonbankruptcy
law" in other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code is highly
relevant to whether "applicable nonbankruptcy law" means
"state law" in $ 541(c)(2), since consistency of usage within
the same statute is to be presumed. Ante, at 758, and n. 2.
This application of a normal and obvious principle of statutory construction would not merit comment, except that we
explicitly rejected it, in favor of a one-subsection-at-a-time
approach, when interpreting another provision of this very
statute earlier this Term. See Dewsnup v. Timm, 502 U. S.
410, 416-417 (1992); id., at 420-423 (Scalia, J., dissenting).
"[W]e express no opinion," our decision said, "as to whether
the words [at issue] have different meaning in other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code." Id., at 417, n. 3. I trust

ALLIED-SIGNAL, INC., as successor-in-interest

to BENDIX CORP. v. DIRECTOR, DIVISION

OF TAXATION

certiorari to the supreme court of new jersey

No. 91-615. Argued March 4, 1992--Reargued April 22, 1992--

Decided June 15, 1992

In order for a State to tax the multistate income of a nondomiciliary corporation, there must be, inter alia, a minimal connection between the interstate activities and the taxing State, Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes of Vt., 445 U. S. 425, 436-437, and a rational relation
between the income attributed to the taxing State and the intrastate
value of the corporate business, id., at 437. Rather than isolating the
intrastate income-producing activities from the rest of the business, a
State may tax a corporation on an apportioned sum of the corporation's
multistate business if the business is unitary. E. g., ASARCO Inc. v.
Idaho Tax Comm'n, 458 U. S. 307, 317. However, a State may not tax
the nondomiciliary corporation's income if it is derived from unrelated
business activity that constitutes a discrete business enterprise.
Exxon Corp. v. Department of Revenue of Wis., 447 U. S. 207, 224.
Petitioner is the successor-in-interest to the Bendix Corporation, a
Delaware corporation. In the late 1970's Bendix acquired 20.6% of the
stock of ASARCO Inc., a New Jersey corporation, and resold it to
ASARCO in 1981, generating a $211.5 million gain. After respondent
New Jersey tax official assessed Bendix for taxes on an apportioned
amount which included in the base the gain realized from the stock disposition, Bendix sued for a refund in State Tax Court. The parties
stipulated that, during the period that Bendix held its investment, it
and ASARCO were unrelated business enterprises each of whose activities had nothing to do with the other, and that, although Bendix held
two seats on ASARCO's board, it exerted no control over ASARCO.
Based on this record, the court held that the assessment was proper,
and the Appellate Division and the State Supreme Court both affirmed.
The latter court stated that the tests for determining a unitary business
are not controlled by the relationship between the taxpayer recipient
and the affiliate generator of the income that is the subject of the tax,
and concluded that Bendix essentially had a business function of corporate acquisitions and divestitures that was an integral operational
activity.

Held:

1. The unitary business principle remains an appropriate device for
ascertaining whether a State has transgressed constitutional limitations
in taxing a nondomiciliary corporation. Pp. 777-788.

(a) The principle that a State may not tax value earned outside its
borders rests on both Due Process and Commerce Clause requirements.
The unitary business rule is a recognition of the States' wide authority
to devise formulae for an accurate assessment of a corporation's intrastate value or income and the necessary limit on the States' authority
to tax value or income that cannot fairly be attributed to the taxpayer's
activities within a State. The indicia of a unitary business are functional integration, centralization of management, and economies of scale.
F. W. Woolworth Co. v. Taxation and Revenue Dept. of N. M., 458 U. S.
354, 364; Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U. S.
159, 179. Pp. 777-783.

(b) New Jersey and several amici have not persuaded this Court
to depart from the doctrine of stare decisis by overruling the cases
that announce and follow the unitary business standard. New Jersey's
sweeping theory--that all income of a corporation doing any business
in a State is, by virtue of common ownership, part of the corporation's
unitary business and apportionable--cannot be reconciled with the concept that the Constitution places limits on a State's power to tax value
earned outside its borders, and is far removed from the latitude that is
granted to States to fashion formulae for apportionment. This Court's
precedents are workable in practice. Any divergent results in applying
the unitary business principle exist because the variations in the unitary
theme are logically consistent with the underlying principles motivating
the approach and because the constitutional test is quite fact sensitive.
In contrast, New Jersey's proposal would disrupt settled expectations
in an area of the law in which the demands of the national economy
require stability. Pp. 783-786.

(c) The argument by other amici that the constitutional test for
determining apportionment should turn on whether the income arises
from transactions and activity in the regular course of the taxpayer's
trade or business, with such income including income from tangible and
intangible property if the acquisition, management, and disposition of
the property constitute integral parts of the taxpayer's regular trade or
business operations, does not benefit the State here. While the payor
and payee need not be engaged in the same unitary business, the capital
transaction must serve an operational rather than an investment function. Container Corp., supra, at 180, n. 19. The existence of a unitary
relation between the payor and the payee is but one justification for
apportionment. Pp. 786-788.

2. The stipulated factual record in this case makes clear that, under
this Court's precedents, New Jersey was not permitted to include the
gain realized on the sale of Bendix's ASARCO stock in its apportionable
tax base. There is no serious contention that any of the three Woolworth factors were present. Functional integration and economies of
scale could not exist because, as the parties stipulated, the companies
were unrelated business enterprises. Moreover, there was no centralization of management, since Bendix did not own enough ASARCO
stock to have the potential to operate ASARCO as an integrated division of a single unitary business and since even potential control is insufficient. Woolworth, supra, at 362. Contrary to the State Supreme
Court's view, the fact that an intangible asset was acquired pursuant to
a long-term corporate strategy of acquisitions and investment does not
turn an otherwise passive investment into an integral operational one.
See Container Corp., 463 U. S., at 180, n. 19. The fact that a transaction
was undertaken for a business purpose does not change its character.
Little is revealed about whether ASARCO was run as part of Bendix's
unitary business by the fact that Bendix may have intended to use the
proceeds of its gain to acquire another company. Nor can it be maintained that Bendix's shares amounted to a short-term investment of
working capital analogous to a bank account or a certificate of deposit.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
Among the limitations the Constitution sets on the powerof a single State to tax the multistate income of a nondomiciliary corporation are these: There must be "a `minimal con-nection' between the interstate activities and the taxing
State," Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes of Vt., 445U. S. 425, 436-437 (1980) (quoting Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair,
437 U. S. 267, 273 (1978)), and there must be a rational rela-tion between the income attributed to the taxing State and
the intrastate value of the corporate business. 445 U. S., at437. Under our precedents, a State need not attempt to isolate the intrastate income-producing activities from the restof the business; it may tax an apportioned sum of the corporation's multistate business if the business is unitary.

Opinion of the Court
(1982). A State may not tax a nondomiciliary corporation'sincome, however, if it is "derive[d] from `unrelated business

activity' which constitutes a `discrete business enterprise.' "Exxon Corp. v. Department of Revenue of Wis., 447 U. S.
207, 224 (1980) (quoting Mobil Oil, supra, at 442, 439). Thiscase presents the questions: (1) whether the unitary business
principle remains an appropriate device for ascertainingwhether a State has transgressed its constitutional limitations; and if so, (2) whether, under the unitary business prin-ciple, the State of New Jersey has the constitutional power
to include in petitioner's apportionable tax base certain in-come that, petitioner maintains, was not generated in the
course of its unitary business.

I
Petitioner Allied-Signal, Inc., is the successor-in-interestto the Bendix Corporation (Bendix). The present dispute

concerns Bendix's corporate business tax liability to theState of New Jersey for the fiscal year ending September 30,
1981. Although three items of income were contested ear-lier, the controversy in this Court involves only one item: the
gain of $211.5 million realized by Bendix on the sale of its20.6% stock interest in ASARCO Inc. (ASARCO). The case
was submitted below on stipulated facts, and we begin witha summary.

During the times in question, Bendix was a Delaware cor-poration with its commercial domicile and corporate headquarters in Michigan. Bendix conducted business in all 50States and 22 foreign countries. App. 154. Having started
business in 1929 as a manufacturer of aviation and automo-tive parts, from 1970 through 1981, Bendix was organized
in four major operating groups: automotive; aerospace/electronics; industrial/energy; and forest products.

Id., at154-155. Each operating group was under separate management, but the chief executive of each group reported tothe chairman and chief executive officer of Bendix. Id., at

504us2$93L 04-12-96 15:16:24 PAGES OPINPGT
774 ALLIED-SIGNAL, INC. v. DIRECTOR, DIV. OF TAXATION

Opinion of the Court
155. In this period Bendix's primary operations in New Jersey were the development and manufacture of aerospace
products. App. 161.

ASARCO is a New Jersey corporation with its principal
offices in New York. It is one of the world's leading producers of nonferrous metals, treating ore taken from its own
mines and ore it obtains from others. Id., at 163-164.
From December 1977 through November 1978, Bendix acquired 20.6% of ASARCO's stock by purchases on the open
market. Id., at 165. In the first half of 1981, Bendix sold
its stock back to ASARCO, generating a gain of $211.5 million. Id., at 172. The issue before us is whether New Jersey can tax an apportionable part of this income.

Our determination of the question whether the business
can be called "unitary," see infra, at 788-789, is all but
controlled by the terms of a stipulation between the taxpayer and the State. They stipulated: "During the period
that Bendix held its investment in ASARCO, Bendix and
ASARCO were unrelated business enterprises each of whose
activities had nothing to do with the other." App. 169.
Furthermore,

"[p]rior to and after its investment in Asarco, no business or activity of Bendix (in New Jersey or otherwise),
either directly or indirectly (other than the investment
itself ), was involved in the nonferrous metal production
business or any other business or activity (in New Jersey or otherwise) in which Asarco was involved. On its
part, Asarco had no business or activity (in New Jersey
or otherwise) which, directly or indirectly, was involved
in any of the businesses or activities (in New Jersey or
otherwise) in which Bendix was involved. None of
Asarco's activities, businesses or income (in New Jersey
or otherwise) were related to or connected with Bendix's
activities, business or income (in New Jersey or otherwise)." Id., at 164-165.

775Cite as: 504 U. S. 768 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
The stipulation gives the following examples of the inde-pendence of the businesses:

"There were no common management, officers, or em-ployees of Bendix and Asarco. There was no use by
Bendix of Asarco's corporate plant, offices or facilitiesand no use by Asarco of Bendix's corporate plant, offices
or facilities. There was no rent or lease of any propertyby Bendix from Asarco and no rent or lease of any property by Asarco from Bendix. Bendix and Asarco wereeach responsible for providing their own legal services,
contracting services, tax services, finance services and
insurance. Bendix and Asarco had separate personneland hiring policies . . . and separate pension and employee benefit plans. Bendix did not lend monies toAsarco and Asarco did not lend monies to Bendix.
There were no joint borrowings by Bendix and Asarco.Bendix did not guaranty any of Asarco's debt and Asarco
did not guaranty any of Bendix's debt. Asarco had no
representative on Bendix's Board of Directors. Bendixdid not pledge its Asarco stock. As far as can be determined there were no sales of product by Asarco itself toBendix or by Bendix to Asarco. There were certain
sales of product in the ordinary course of business byAsarco subsidiaries to Bendix but these sales were minute compared to Asarco's total sales . . . . These openmarket sales were at arms length prices and did not
come about due to the Bendix investment in Asarco.
There were no transfers of employees between Bendixand Asarco."

Id., at 169-171.

While Bendix held its ASARCO stock, ASARCO agreed
to recommend that two seats on the 14-member ASARCO
Board of Directors be filled by Bendix representatives. The
seats were filled by Bendix chief executive officer W. M.
Agee and a Bendix outside director. Id., at 168. Nonetheless, "Bendix did not exert any control over Asarco." Ibid.

The New Jersey Supreme Court held it was constitutional
to consider the gain realized from the sale of the ASARCO
stock as earned in Bendix's unitary business, drawing from
our decision in Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax
Bd., 463 U. S. 159, 166 (1983), the principle that "the context
for determining whether a unitary business exists has, as an
overriding consideration, the exchange or transfer of value,
which may be evidenced by functional integration, centralization of management, and economies of scale." 125 N. J.,
at 34, 592 A. 2d, at 543-544. The New Jersey Supreme
Court went on to state: "The tests for determining a unitary
business are not controlled, however, by the relationship between the taxpayer recipient and the affiliate generator of
the income that becomes the subject of State tax." Id., at
35, 592 A. 2d, at 544. Based upon Bendix documents setting
out corporate strategy, the court found that the acquisition
and sale of ASARCO "went well beyond . . . passive investments in business enterprises," id., at 36, 592 A. 2d, at 544,
and Bendix "essentially had a business function of corporate
acquisitions and divestitures that was an integral operational
activity." Ibid. As support for its conclusion that the proceeds from the sale of the ASARCO stock were attributable
to a unitary business, the New Jersey Supreme Court relied
in part on the fact that Bendix intended to use those pro504us2$93L 04-12-96 15:16:24 PAGES OPINPGT

ceeds in what later proved to be an unsuccessful bid toacquire Martin Marietta, a company whose aerospace business, it was hoped, would complement Bendix's aerospace/electronics business. Id., at 36, 592 A. 2d, at 545.

We granted certiorari. 502 U. S. 977 (1991). At the ini-tial oral argument in this case New Jersey advanced the
proposition that all income earned by a nondomiciliarycorporation could be apportioned by any State in which the
corporati on does busi ness. To understand better theconsequences of this theory we requested rebriefing and
reargument. Our order asked the parties to address threequestions:

"1. Should the Court overrule ASARCO Inc. v. Idaho
State Tax Comm'n, 458 U. S. 307 (1982), and F. W. Woolworth Co. v. Taxation and Revenue Dept. of New Mex-ico, 458 U. S. 354 (1982)?

"2. If ASARCO and Woolworth were overruled, shouldthe decision apply retroactively?
"3. If ASARCO and Woolworth were overruled, whatconstitutional principles should govern state taxation of
corporations doing business in several states?" 503U. S. 928 (1992).

Because we give a negative answer to the first question, seeinfra, at 783-786, we need not address the second and third.

II
The principle that a State may not tax value earned out-side its borders rests on the fundamental requirement of

both the Due Process and Commerce Clauses that there be"some definite link, some minimum connection, between a
state and the person, property or transaction it seeks to tax."
Miller Brothers Co. v. Maryland, 347 U. S. 340, 344-345(1954). The reason the Commerce Clause includes this limit

is self-evident: In a Union of 50 States, to permit each Stateto tax activities outside its borders would have drastic conse504us2$93L 04-12-96 15:16:24 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
quences for the national economy, as businesses could be sub-jected to severe multiple taxation. But the Due Process

Clause also underlies our decisions in this area. Althoughour modern due process jurisprudence rejects a rigid, formalistic definition of minimum connection, we have not abandoned the requirement that, in the case of a tax on an activ-ity, there must be a connection to the activity itself, rather

than a connection only to the actor the State seeks to tax,see

Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, ante, at 306-308. The constitutional question in a case such as Quill Corp. is whetherthe State has the authority to tax the corporation at all.

The present inquiry, by contrast, focuses on the guidelines
necessary to circumscribe the reach of the State's legitimate
power to tax. We are guided by the basic principle that the
State's power to tax an individual's or corporation's activities
is justified by the "protection, opportunities and benefits" the
State confers on those activities. Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney
Co., 311 U. S. 435, 444 (1940).

Because of the complications and uncertainties in allocating the income of multistate businesses to the several States,
we permit States to tax a corporation on an apportionable
share of the multistate business carried on in part in the
taxing State. That is the unitary business principle. It is
not a novel construct, but one that we approved within a
short time after the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment's
Due Process Clause. We now give a brief summary of its
development.

When States attempted to value railroad or telegraph
companies for property tax purposes, they encountered the
difficulty that what makes such a business valuable is the
enterprise as a whole, rather than the track or wires that
happen to be located within a State's borders. The Court
held that, consistent with the Due Process Clause, a State
could base its tax assessments upon "the proportionate part
of the value resulting from the combination of the means by
which the business was carried on, a value existing to an

appreciable extent throughout the entire domain of opera-tion." Adams Express Co. v. Ohio State Auditor, 165 U. S.

194, 220-221 (1897) (citing Western Union Telegraph Co. v.Attorney General of Massachusetts, 125 U. S. 530 (1888));
Massachusetts v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 141 U. S. 40(1891);

Maine v. Grand Trunk R. Co., 142 U. S. 217 (1891);Pittsburgh, C., C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Backus, 154 U. S. 421

(1894); Cleveland, C., C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Backus, 154 U. S.439 (1894); Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Taggart, 163 U. S.
1 (1896); Pullman's Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, 141U. S. 18 (1891).

Adams Express recognized that the principles that permita State to levy a tax on the capital stock of a railroad, telegraph, or sleeping car company by reference to its unitarybusiness also allow proportional valuation of a unitary business in enterprises of other sorts. As the Court explained:"The physical unity existing in the former is lacking in the
latter; but there is the same unity in the use of the entireproperty for the specific purpose, and there are the same
elements of value arising from such use." 165 U. S., at 221.The unitary business principle was later permitted for
state taxation of corporate income as well as property andcapital. Thus, in Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, 254 U. S. 113, 120-121 (1920), we explained:

"The profits of the corporation were largely earned bya series of transactions beginning with manufacture in

Connecticut and ending with sale in other States. Inthis it was typical of a large part of the manufacturing
business conducted in the State. The legislature in at-tempting to put upon this business its fair share of the
burden of taxation was faced with the impossibility ofallocating specifically the profits earned by the processes
conducted within its borders. It, therefore, adopted amethod of apportionment which, for all that appears in
this record, reached, and was meant to reach, only theprofits earned within the State."

780 ALLIED-SIGNAL, INC. v. DIRECTOR, DIV. OF TAXATION

Opinion of the Court
As these cases make clear, the unitary business rule is arecognition of two imperatives: the States' wide authority to

devise formulae for an accurate assessment of a corporation'sintrastate value or income; and the necessary limit on the
States' authority to tax value or income that cannot in fairness be attributed to the taxpayer's activities within theState. It is this second component, the necessity for a limiting principle, that underlies this case.As we indicated in

Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of
Taxes of Vt., 445 U. S., at 442: "Where the business activitiesof the dividend payor have nothing to do with the activities

of the recipient in the taxing State, due process considerations might well preclude apportionability, because there
would be no underlying unitary business." The constitutional question becomes whether the income "derive[s] from
`unrelated business activity' which constitutes a `discrete
business enterprise.' " Exxon Corp. v. Department of Revenue of Wis., 447 U. S., at 224 (quoting Mobil Oil, supra, at
442, 439).

Although Mobil Oil and Exxon made clear that the unitary business principle limits the States' taxing power, it
was not until our decisions in ASARCO Inc. v. Idaho Tax
Comm'n, 458 U. S. 307 (1982), and F. W. Woolworth Co. v.
Taxation and Revenue Dept. of N. M., 458 U. S. 354 (1982),
that we struck down a state attempt to include in the apportionable tax base income not derived from the unitary business. In those cases the States sought to tax unrelated
business activity.

The principal question in ASARCO concerned Idaho's attempt to include in the apportionable tax base of ASARCO
certain dividends received from, among other companies, the
Southern Peru Copper Corp. 458 U. S., at 309, 320. The
analysis is of direct relevance for us because we have held
that for constitutional purposes capital gains should be
treated as no different from dividends. Id., at 330. The
ASARCO in the 1982 case was the same company as the

Opinion of the Court
ASARCO here. It was one of four of Southern Peru's shareholders, owning 51.5% of its stock. Under an agreement
with the other shareholders, ASARCO was prevented from
dominating Southern Peru's board of directors. ASARCO
had the right to appoint 6 of Southern Peru's 13 directors,
while 8 votes were required for the passage of any resolution. Southern Peru was in the business of producing unrefined copper (a nonferrous ore), some of which it sold to its
shareholders. ASARCO purchased approximately 35% of
Southern Peru's output, at average representative trade
prices quoted in a trade publication and over which neither
Southern Peru nor ASARCO had any control. Id., at 320-
322. We concluded that "ASARCO's Idaho silver mining
and Southern Peru's autonomous business [were] insufficiently connected to permit the two companies to be classified as a unitary business." Id., at 322.

On the same day we decided ASARCO, we decided Woolworth. In that case, the taxpayer company was domiciled
in New York and operated a chain of retail variety stores in
the United States. In the company's apportionable state tax
base, New Mexico sought to include earnings from four subsidiaries operating in foreign countries. The subsidiaries
also engaged in chainstore retailing. 458 U. S., at 356-357.
We observed that although the parent company had the potential to operate the subsidiaries as integrated divisions of
a single unitary business, that potential was not significant
if the subsidiaries in fact comprise discrete business operations. Id., at 362. Following the indicia of a unitary business defined in Mobil Oil, we inquired whether any of the
three objective factors were present. The factors were: (1)
functional integration; (2) centralization of management; and
(3) economies of scale. 458 U. S., at 364. We found that
"[e]xcept for the type of occasional oversight--with respect
to capital structure, major debt, and dividends--that any
parent gives to an investment in a subsidiary," id., at 369,

782 ALLIED-SIGNAL, INC. v. DIRECTOR, DIV. OF TAXATION

Opinion of the Court
none of these factors was present. The subsidiaries werefound not to be part of a unitary business.

Ibid.
Our most recent case applying the unitary business princi-ple was

Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Bd.,
463 U. S. 159 (1983). The taxpayer there was a vertically
integrated corporation which manufactured custom-orderedpaperboard packaging.

Id., at 171. California sought to
tax income it received from its wholly owned and mostlyowned foreign subsidiaries, each of which was in the same

business as the parent. Id., at 171-172. The foreign sub-sidiaries were given a fair degree of autonomy: They purchased only 1% of their materials from the parent, and per-sonnel transfers from the parent to the subsidiaries were
rare. Id., at 172. We recognized, however:

"[I]n certain respects, the relationship between appellant and its subsidiaries was decidedly close. For exam-ple, approximately half of the subsidiaries' long-term

debt was either held directly, or guaranteed, by appellant. Appellant also provided advice and consultationregarding manufacturing techniques, engineering, design, architecture, insurance, and cost accounting to anumber of its subsidiaries, either by entering into technical service agreements with them or by informal ar-rangement. Finally, appellant occasionally assisted its
subsidiaries in their procurement of equipment, eitherby selling them used equipment of its own or by employing its own purchasing department to act as an agent
for the subsidiaries." Id., at 173.

Based on these facts, we found that the taxpayer had not
met its burden of showing by " ` "clear and cogent evidence" ' " that the State sought to tax extraterritorial values.

Opinion of the Court
In the course of our decision in Container Corp., wereaffirmed that the constitutional test focuses on functional

integration, centralization of management, and economies ofscale. 463 U. S., at 179 (citing

Woolworth, supra, at 364;
Mobil Oil, supra, at 438). We also reiterated that a unitary
business may exist without a flow of goods between the par-ent and subsidiary, if instead there is a flow of value between

the entities. 463 U. S., at 178. The principal virtue of theunitary business principle of taxation is that it does a better
job of accounting for "the many subtle and largely unquanti-fiable transfers of value that take place among the components of a single enterprise" than, for example, geographical
or transactional accounting. Id., at 164-165 (citing Mobil
Oil, 445 U. S., at 438-439).

Notwithstanding the Court's long experience in applying
the unitary business principle, New Jersey and several amici
curiae argue that it is not an appropriate means for distinguishing between income generated within a State and income generated without. New Jersey has not persuaded us
to depart from the doctrine of stare decisis by overruling
our cases that announce and follow the unitary business
standard. In deciding whether to depart from a prior decision, one relevant consideration is whether the decision is
"unsound in principle." Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 546 (1985). Another
is whether it is "unworkable in practice." Ibid. And, of
course, reliance interests are of particular relevance because
"[a]dherence to precedent promotes stability, predictability,
and respect for judicial authority." Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm'n, 502 U. S. 197, 202 (1991) (citing Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 265-266 (1986)). See
also Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, ante, at 316 (industry's
reliance justifies adherence to precedent); ante, at 320

of New Jersey and its amici.

784 ALLIED-SIGNAL, INC. v. DIRECTOR, DIV. OF TAXATION

Opinion of the Court
New Jersey contends that the unitary business principlemust be abandoned in its entirety, arguing that a nondomiciliary State should be permitted "to apportion all the incomeof a separate multistate corporate taxpayer." Brief for Respondent on Reargument 27. According to New Jersey, the
unitary business principle does not reflect economic reality,while its proposed theory does. We are not convinced.

New Jersey does not appear to dispute the basic proposi-tion that a State may not tax value earned outside its borders. It contends instead that all income of a corporationdoing any business in a State is, by virtue of common ownership, part of the corporation's unitary business and apportionable. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 25-26 (Apr. 22, 1992). New
Jersey's sweeping theory cannot be reconciled with the concept that the Constitution places limits on a State's power to
tax value earned outside of its borders. To be sure, our
cases give States wide latitude to fashion formulae designed
to approximate the in-state portion of value produced by a
corporation's truly multistate activity. But that is far removed from New Jersey's theory that any business in the
State, no matter how small or unprofitable, subjects all of
a corporation's out-of-state income, no matter how discrete,
to apportionment.

According to New Jersey, Brief for Respondent on Reargument 11, there is no logical distinction between short-term
investment of working capital, which all concede is apportionable, see Reply Brief for Petitioner on Reargument 4-5,
and n. 3; Tr. of Oral Arg. 7-8 (Apr. 22, 1992); Container Corp.,
supra, at 180, n. 19, and all other investments. The same
point was advanced by the dissent in ASARCO, 458 U. S., at
337 (opinion of O'Connor, J.). New Jersey's basic theory is
that multistate corporations like Bendix regard all of their
holdings as pools of assets, used for maximum long-term
profitability, and that any distinction between operational
and investment assets is artificial. We may assume, arguendo, that the managers of Bendix cared most about the

785Cite as: 504 U. S. 768 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
profits entry on a financial statement, but that state of mindsheds little light on the question whether in pursuing maximum profits they treated particular intangible assets asserving, on the one hand, an investment function, or, on the
other, an operational function. See Container Corp., supra,
at 180, n. 19. That is the relevant unitary business inquiry,one which focuses on the objective characteristics of the

asset's use and its relation to the taxpayer and its activitieswithin the taxing State. It is an inquiry to which our cases
give content, and which is necessary if the limits of the DueProcess and Commerce Clauses are to have substance in a
modern economy. In short, New Jersey's suggestion is not
in accord with the well-established and substantial case law
interpreting the Due Process and Commerce Clauses.

Our precedents are workable in practice; indeed, New Jersey conceded as much. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37-38 (Apr. 22,
1992). If lower courts have reached divergent results in
applying the unitary business principle to different factual
circumstances, that is because, as we have said, any number
of variations on the unitary business theme "are logically
consistent with the underlying principles motivating the approach," Container Corp., supra, at 167, and also because the
constitutional test is quite fact sensitive.

Indeed, if anything would be unworkable in practice, it
would be for us now to abandon our settled jurisprudence
defining the limits of state power to tax under the unitary
business principle. State legislatures have relied upon our
precedents by enacting tax codes which allocate intangible
nonbusiness income to the domiciliary State, see App. to
Brief for Petitioner on Reargument 1a-7a (collecting statutes). Were we to adopt New Jersey's theory, we would be
required either to invalidate those statutes or authorize what
would be certain double taxation. And, of course, we would
defeat the reliance interest of those corporations that have
structured their activities and paid their taxes based upon
the well-established rules we here confirm. Difficult ques504us2$93L 04-12-96 15:16:25 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tions respecting the retroactive effect of our decision wouldalso be presented. See

James B. Beam Distilling Co. v.
Georgia, 501 U. S. 529 (1991). New Jersey's proposal woulddisrupt settled expectations in an area of the law in which

the demands of the national economy require stability.

Not willing to go quite so far as New Jersey, some amici
curiae urge us to modify, rather than abandon, the unitary
business principle. See, e. g., Brief for Multistate Tax Com-mission as

Amicus Curiae; Brief for Multistate Tax Commission as Amicus Curiae on Reargument; Brief for ChevronCorporation as

Amicus Curiae. They urge us to hold that
the Constitution does not require a unitary business relation
between the payor and the payee in order for a State to
apportion the income the payee corporation receives from an
investment in the payor. Rather, they urge us to adopt as
the constitutional test the standard set forth in the business
income definition in $ 1(a) of the Uniform Division of Income
for Tax Purposes Act (UDITPA), 7A U. L. A. 331, 336 (1985).
Under UDITPA, "business income," which is apportioned, is
defined as: "income arising from transactions and activity in
the regular course of the taxpayer's trade or business and
includes income from tangible and intangible property if the
acquisition, management, and disposition of the property
constitute integral parts of the taxpayer's regular trade or
business operations." UDITPA $ 1(a). "Non-business income," which is allocated, is defined as "all income other than
business income." $ 1(e).

In the abstract, these definitions may be quite compatible
with the unitary business principle. See Container Corp.,
supra, at 167 (noting that most of the relevant provisions of
the California statute under which we sustained the challenged tax there were derived from UDITPA). Furthermore, the unitary business principle is not so inflexible that
as new methods of finance and new forms of business evolve
it cannot be modified or supplemented where appropriate.
It does not follow, though, that apportionment of all income

787Cite as: 504 U. S. 768 (1992)
Opinion of the Court
is permitted by the mere fact of corporate presence withinthe State; and New Jersey offers little more in support of

the decision of the State Supreme Court.We agree that the payee and the payor need not be engaged in the same unitary business as a prerequisite to apportionment in all cases. Container Corp. says as much.What is required instead is that the capital transaction serve

an operational rather than an investment function. 463U. S., at 180, n. 19. Hence, in

ASARCO, although we rejected the dissent's factual contention that the stock invest-ments there constituted "interim uses of idle funds `accumulated for the future operation of [the taxpayer's] . . . business
[operation],' " we did not dispute the suggestion that had that
been so the income would have been apportionable. 458
U. S., at 325, n. 21.

To be sure, the existence of a unitary relation between the
payor and the payee is one means of meeting the constitutional requirement. Thus, in ASARCO and Woolworth we
focused on the question whether there was such a relation.
We did not purport, however, to establish a general requirement that there be a unitary relation between the payor and
the payee to justify apportionment, nor do we do so today.

It remains the case that "[i]n order to exclude certain income from the apportionment formula, the company must
prove that `the income was earned in the course of activities unrelated to [those carried out in the taxing] State.' "
Exxon Corp. v. Department of Revenue of Wis., 447 U. S., at
223 (quoting Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes of
Vt., 445 U. S., at 439). The existence of a unitary relation
between payee and payor is one justification for apportionment, but not the only one. Hence, for example, a State may
include within the apportionable income of a nondomiciliary
corporation the interest earned on short-term deposits in a
bank located in another State if that income forms part of
the working capital of the corporation's unitary business,
notwithstanding the absence of a unitary relationship be504us2$93L 04-12-96 15:16:25 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tween the corporation and the bank. That circumstance, ofcourse, is not at all presented here. See infra this page

and 789. III

Application of the foregoing principles to the present caseyields a clear result: The stipulated factual record now before
us presents an even weaker basis for inferring a unitary busi-ness than existed in either ASARCO or Woolworth, making
this an a fortiori case. There is no serious contention thatany of the three factors upon which we focused in

Woolworthwere present. Functional integration and economies of

scale could not exist because, as the parties have stipulated,"Bendix and Asarco were unrelated business enterprises
each of whose activities had nothing to do with the other."App. 169. Moreover, because Bendix owned only 20.6% of
ASARCO's stock, it did not have the potential to operateASARCO as an integrated division of a single unitary business, and of course, even potential control is not sufficient.
Woolworth, 458 U. S., at 362. There was no centralizationof management.

Furthermore, contrary to the view expressed below by theNew Jersey Supreme Court, see 125 N. J., at 36-37, 592
A. 2d, at 544-545, the mere fact that an intangible asset wasacquired pursuant to a long-term corporate strategy of acquisitions and dispositions does not convert an otherwisepassive investment into an integral operational one. Indeed, in Container Corp. we noted the important distinctionbetween a capital transaction that serves an investment
function and one that serves an operational function. 463U. S., at 180, n. 19 (citing

Corn Products Refining Co. v. Commissioner, 350 U. S. 46, 50-53 (1955)). If that distinction isto retain its vitality, then, as we held in ASARCO, the fact

that a transaction was undertaken for a business purposedoes not change its character. 458 U. S., at 326. Idaho had
argued that intangible income could be treated as earned inthe course of a unitary business if the intangible property

Opinion of the Court
which produced that income is " `acquired, managed or dis-posed of for purposes relating or contributing to the taxpayer's business.' " Ibid. (quoting Brief for Appellee 4). In re-jecting the argument we observed:

"This definition of unitary business would destroy theconcept. The business of a corporation requires that it
earn money to continue operations and to provide a re-turn on its invested capital. Consequently

all of its operations, including any investment made, in some sensecan be said to be `for purposes related to or contributing

to the [corporation's] business.' When pressed to its
logical limit, this conception of the `unitary business'limitation becomes no limitation at all." 458 U. S., at

326.
Apart from semantics, we see no distinction between the
"purpose" test we rejected in ASARCO and the "ingrainedacquisition-divestiture policy" approach adopted by the New

Jersey Supreme Court. 125 N. J., at 36, 592 A. 2d, at 544.The hallmarks of an acquisition that is part of the taxpayer's
unitary business continue to be functional integration, cen-tralization of management, and economies of scale.

Container Corp. clarified that these essentials could respectivelybe shown by: transactions not undertaken at arm's length,

463 U. S., at 180, n. 19; a management role by the parent that
is grounded in its own operational expertise and operationalstrategy,

ibid.; and the fact that the corporations are engaged in the same line of business, id., at 178. It is undis-puted that none of these circumstances existed here.

The New Jersey Supreme Court also erred in relying on
the fact that Bendix intended to use the proceeds of its gain
from the sale of ASARCO to acquire Martin Marietta.
Even if we were to assume that Martin Marietta, once acquired, would have been operated as part of Bendix's unitary
business, that reveals little about whether ASARCO was run
as part of Bendix's unitary business. Nor can it be main504us2$93L 04-12-96 15:16:25 PAGES OPINPGT

tained that Bendix's shares of ASARCO stock, which it heldfor over two years, amounted to a short-term investment of

working capital analogous to a bank account or certificateof deposit. See

Container Corp., 463 U. S., at 180, n. 19;
ASARCO, 458 U. S., at 325, n. 21.

In sum, the agreed-upon facts make clear that under ourprecedents New Jersey was not permitted to include the gain

realized on the sale of Bendix's ASARCO stock in the for-mer's apportionable tax base.

The judgment of the New Jersey Supreme Court is re-versed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justice,
Justice Blackmun, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

In my view, petitioner has not shown by "clear and cogent
evidence" that its investment in ASARCO was not operationally related to the aerospace business petitioner conducted in New Jersey. Exxon Corp. v. Department of Revenue of Wis., 447 U. S. 207, 221 (1980) (internal quotation
marks omitted). Though I am largely in agreement with the
Court's analysis, I part company on the application of it here.

I agree with the Court that we cannot adopt New Jersey's
suggestion that the unitary business principle be replaced by
a rule allowing a State to tax a proportionate share of all
the income generated by any corporation doing business
there. See ante, at 784. Were we to adopt a rule allowing
taxation to depend upon corporate identity alone, as New
Jersey suggests, the entire due process inquiry would become fictional, as the identities of corporations would fracture in a corporate shell game to avoid taxation. Under
New Jersey's theory, for example, petitioner could avoid having its ASARCO investment taxed in New Jersey simply by
establishing a separate subsidiary to hold those earnings outside New Jersey. A constitutional principle meant to ensure

O'Connor, J., dissenting
that States tax only business activities they can reasonablyclaim to have helped support should depend on something

more than manipulations of corporate structure. See Mobil
Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes of Vt., 445 U. S. 425, 440
(1980) ("[T]he form of business organization may have nothing to do with the underlying unity or diversity of businessenterprise");

Fargo v. Hart, 193 U. S. 490 (1904) (refusing
to find unitary business even though single owner); Adams
Express Co. v. Ohio State Auditor, 165 U. S. 194, 222 (1897)
(same).New Jersey suggests that we should presume that all the

holdings of a single corporation are mutually interdependent
because common ownership will stabilize profits from the
commonly held businesses, generating flows of value between them that make them part of a unity. While it may
be true that many corporations attempt to diversify their
holdings to avoid business cycles, we have refused to presume a flow of value into an in-state business from the
potential benefits of being part of a larger multistate, multibusiness corporation. The reason for this is simple: Diversification may benefit the corporation as an entity without necessarily affecting the business activity in the taxing State
and without requiring any support from the taxing State.
See Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., 311 U. S. 435, 444 (1940)
(State may not tax where it has not "given anything for
which it can ask return").

I also agree with the Court that there need not be a unitary relationship between the underlying business of a taxpayer and the companies in which it invests in order for a
State to tax investment income. See ante, at 787. "[A]ctive operational control" of the investment income payor
by the taxpayer is certainly not required. ASARCO Inc. v.
Idaho Tax Comm'n, 458 U. S. 307, 343 (1982) (O'Connor, J.,
dissenting). Insofar as a requirement that the investment
payor and payee be unitary was suggested by our decisions

O'Connor, J., dissenting
nue Dept. of N. M., 458 U. S. 354 (1982), petitioner concedesthat was a "doctrinal foot fault." Reply Brief for Petitioner

on Reargument 4. Although a unitary relationship betweenthe investment income payor and payee would suffice to relate the investment income to the in-state business, such a
connection is not necessary. Taxation of investment incomereceived from a nondomiciliary taxpayer's investment in another corporation requires only that the investment incomebe sufficiently related to the taxpayer's in-state business, not
that the taxpayer's business and the corporation in which itinvests be unitary. Only when the State seeks to tax directly the income of a nondomiciliary taxpayer's subsidiary
or affiliate through combined reporting, see Container Corp.
of America v. Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U. S. 159, 169, and n. 7
(1983), must the underlying businesses of the taxpayer and
its affiliate or subsidiary be unitary. In any case, the key
question for purposes of due process is whether the income
that the State seeks to tax is, by the time it is realized, sufficiently related to a unitary business, part of which operates
in the taxing State.

In this connection, I agree with the Court that out-of-state
investments serving an operational function in the nondomiciliary taxpayer's in-state business are sufficiently related to
that business to be taxed. In particular, I agree that " `interim uses of idle funds "accumulated for the future operation of [the taxpayer's] business [operation]," ' " may be
taxed. Ante, at 787 (quoting ASARCO, supra, at 325, n. 21).
The Court, however, leaves "operational function" largely
undefined. I presume that the Court's test allows taxation
in at least those circumstances in which it is allowed by
the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act
(UDITPA). Ante, at 786. UDITPA counts as apportionable business income from "tangible and intangible property
if the acquisition, management, and disposition of the property constitute integral parts of the taxpayer's regular trade
or business operations." UDITPA $ 1(a), 7A U. L. A. 336

793Cite as: 504 U. S. 768 (1992)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
(1985) (emphasis added). Presumably, investment income
serves an operational function if it is, to give only some examples, intended to be used by the time it is realized for
making the business' anticipated payments; for expanding or
replacing plants and equipment; or for acquiring other unitary businesses that will serve the in-state business as stable
sources of supply or demand, or that will generate economies
of scale or savings in administration.

In its application of these principles to this case, however,
I diverge from the Court's analysis. The Court explains
that while "interest earned on short-term deposits in a bank
located in another State" may be taxed "if that income forms
part of the working capital of the corporation's unitary business," petitioner's longer term investment in ASARCO may
not be taxed. Ante, at 787. The Court finds the investment here not to be operational because it was not analogous
to a "short-term investment of working capital analogous to
a bank account or certificate of deposit." Ante, at 790.

Any distinction between short-term and long-term investments cannot be of constitutional dimension. Whether an
investment is short-term or long-term, what matters for due
process purposes is whether the investment is operationally
related to the in-state business. "The interim investment
of retained earnings prior to their commitment to a major
corporate project . . . merely recapitulates on a grander scale
the short-term investment of working capital prior to its
commitment to the daily financial needs of the company."
ASARCO, supra, at 338 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). I see
no distinction relevant to due process between investing
in a company in order to build capital to acquire a second
company related to the in-state business and, for example,
"leas[ing] for a term of years the areas of [the taxpayer's]
office buildings into which it intends ultimately to expand,"
which could hardly be claimed to set up a "separate and unrelated leasing business." 458 U. S., at 338, n. 6.

794 ALLIED-SIGNAL, INC. v. DIRECTOR, DIV. OF TAXATION

O'Connor, J., dissenting
The link between the ASARCO investment here and thein-state business is closer than the Court suggests. It is not

just that the ASARCO investment was made to benefit Bendix as a corporate entity. As the Court points out, any investment a corporation makes is intended to benefit the corporation in general. Ante, at 789. The proper question israther: Was the income New Jersey seeks to tax intended to

be used to benefit a unitary business of which Bendix's NewJersey operations were a part?

Petitioner has not carried the heavy burden of showingby clear and cogent evidence that the capital gains from
ASARCO were not operationally related to its in-state business. See Container Corp., supra, at 175. Though this
case comes to us on a stipulated record, there is no stipulation that the ASARCO capital gains were not intended to be
used to benefit a unitary business, part of which operated in
New Jersey. Instead, the record suggests that, by the time
the capital gains were realized, at least some of the income
was intended to be used in the attempt to acquire a corporation also engaged in the aerospace industry. App. 70-71, 81,
193. The acquisition of Martin Marietta, had it succeeded,
would have been part of petitioner's unitary aerospace business, part of which operated in New Jersey. Id., at 194. As
the New Jersey Supreme Court found: "[T]he purpose of acquiring Martin Marietta was to complement the aerospaceelectronics facets of Bendix business, some of which are located in New Jersey. . . . Even though the Martin Marietta
takeover never came to fruition, the fact that it served as
a goal for part of the capital generated by the sales of
ASARCO . . . stock nurtures the premise that Bendix's ingrained policy of acquisitions and divestitures projected the
existence of a unitary business." Bendix Corp. v. Director,
Div. of Taxation, 125 N. J. 20, 38, 592 A. 2d 536, 545 (1991).
We will, "if reasonably possible, defer to the judgment of
state courts in deciding whether a particular set of activities
constitutes a `unitary business.' " Container Corp., supra,

at 175. Because petitioner has failed to show by clear andcogent evidence that the income derived from the ASARCO

investment was not related to the operations of its unitaryaerospace business, part of which was in New Jersey, New
Jersey should be able to apportion and tax that income. Asthe Court holds that it may not, I must respectfully dissent.

No. 91-7051. Feijoo Tomala v. United States. C. A. 2dCir. Certiorari denied. Reported below: 946 F. 2d 883.

Justice White, with whom Justice Thomas joins, dissenting.
The issue in this case is whether the trial court erred in in-structing a jury that petitioner could be convicted for importing

illegal drugs if she consciously avoided knowledge that drugswere concealed in a suitcase she was carrying.

Petitioner, who had just arrived from Ecuador with her twoyoung daughters, was arrested at Kennedy International Airport
when a Customs inspector found three kilograms of cocaine in ahidden compartment of a suitcase. She was charged with importing cocaine into the United States in violation of 21 U. S. C.$ 952(a). At trial, petitioner defended on the theory that she had
been unwittingly duped into serving as a drug courier. She testi-fied that a woman had approached her at the Ecuador airport,
identified herself as Maria Alcivar, and asked her to deliver thesuitcase to Alcivar's sister, Georgina de Rodrigues. The woman
opened the suitcase to show petitioner that it contained severalnew dresses and explained that she was returning the dresses to
her sister because she had been unable to sell them in Ecuador.She provided petitioner with an incomplete New Jersey address
and a telephone number, which had a New Jersey area code fol-lowed by an eight-digit number.

The trial court charged the jury that the Government bore theburden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner knew
she possessed narcotics. But the court added:

" `[I]t is not necessary for the government to prove to anabsolute certainty that [petitioner] knew that she possessed

narcotics. [Petitioner's] knowledge may be established byproof beyond a reasonable doubt that [petitioner] was aware,
was aware of a high probability that the suitcase containednarcotics unless, despite this high probability, the facts show
that [petitioner] actually believed that the suitcase did notcontain narcotics.' " Brief for United States 6.

Petitioner's first trial ended in a hung jury. On retrial, she wasconvicted and sentenced to 60 months' imprisonment. The Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. 946 F. 2d 883 (1991)( judgment order).

Petitioner contends that the trial court erred in giving theinstruction quoted above because the Government had not argued

933ORDERS

that she consciously avoided knowledge that she was transportingdrugs and because the instruction allows a conviction on the basis
of recklessness or negligence, thereby vitiating the statutory re-quirement that the Government prove petitioner acted knowingly.
She urges that the outcome of her case would have been differenthad she been tried in another circuit. The Government concedes
as much, citing conflicting decisions by the Courts of Appeals forthe Ninth and Tenth Circuits, and suggests that we grant certiorari. See United States v. De Francisco-Lopez, 939 F. 2d 1405(CA10 1991); United States v. Sanchez-Robles, 927 F. 2d 1070
(CA9 1991).I agree with petitioner and the Government that the outcome
of a federal criminal prosecution should not depend upon the cir-cuit in which the case is tried. I therefore would grant certiorari
to resolve the conflict in the Courts of Appeals.

No. 91-7169. Fowner v. United States. C. A. 10th Cir.Certiorari denied. Reported below: 947 F. 2d 954.

Justice White, dissenting.
This case presents the question whether the weight of uningest-ible waste material should be included in calculating the weight

of a "mixture or substance" containing a detectable amount of acontrolled substance for purposes of $ 2D1.1 of the United States
Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (Nov. 1992). Peti-tioner was arrested in possession of 79.7 grams of methamphetamine, as well as approximately 24 gallons of a liquid mixturecontaining detectable amounts of a controlled substance. At trial,
an expert testified that the liquid was a waste byproduct of meth-amphetamine manufacturing. Petitioner claims that his sentence
should not have been based on the entire weight of the 24 gallonsof liquid because it is an uningestable waste. In the decision
below, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that it wasunnecessary to make a determination whether the liquid was
waste and intended to be discarded. Following Tenth Circuitprecedent, the Court of Appeals held that so long as the liquid
contained a detectable amount of a controlled substance, its entireweight was properly included in the calculation of the defendant's
sentence under the Guidelines. See also United States v. Dorrough, 927 F. 2d 498 (CA10 1991); United States v. Callihan, 915F. 2d 1462, 1463 (CA10 1990).

934 OCTOBER TERM, 1991

White, J., dissenting 504 U. S.
Several Courts of Appeals have followed a different rationale,holding that sentencing calculations may not be based on the total
weight of mixtures containing uningestable "waste" material. InUnited States v. Rolande-Gabriel, 938 F. 2d 1231 (CA11 1991), the
defendant had been arrested in possession of a liquid substancecontaining cocaine base, a cutting agent, and liquid waste. The
Court of Appeals there noted that the liquid waste did not facili-tate the use, marketing, or access of the drug, and concluded that
its use in sentencing calculations was irrational. Id., at 1237.The Court of Appeals therefore held that the weight of unusable
waste material should not be used for sentencing purposes. Simi-larly, in United States v. Jennings, 945 F. 2d 129 (1991), the Court
of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that it would be inappro-priate to sentence defendants on the basis of the entire weight of
an undistributable methamphetamine "cooking" mixture contain-ing a small amount of methamphetamine mixed with poisonous
unreacted chemicals and byproducts. See also United States v.Touby, 909 F. 2d 759, 773 (CA3 1990) (suggesting that, while
weight of cutting ingredients may properly be included in sentenc-ing calculation, weight of unconsumable manufacturing byproducts may not), aff 'd on other grounds, 500 U. S. 160 (1991).Several other Courts of Appeals, like the court below, have
taken a contrary approach. In United States v. Mahecha-Onofre,936 F. 2d 623 (CA1), cert. denied, 502 U. S. 1009 (1991), cocaine
had been chemically bonded to the acrylic material of which twosuitcases were constructed. When calculating the defendant's
sentence, the District Court included the total weight of the suit-cases, minus all metal parts. 936 F. 2d, at 625. The Court of
Appeals noted that, unlike blotter paper or cutting agents, thesuitcase material obviously could not be consumed and that the
cocaine had to be separated from the suitcase material before itcould be used; however, the court held, this distinction did not
make a difference for sentencing purposes. Id., at 626. Simi-larly, in United States v. Beltran-Felix, 934 F. 2d 1075 (1991),
cert. denied, 502 U. S. 1065 (1991), the Court of Appeals for theNinth Circuit held that, for purposes of sentencing under 21
U. S. C. $ 841(b)(1)(B), a solution containing methamphetamineneed not be a "marketable mixture" in a distributable state. In
United States v. Baker, 883 F. 2d 13 (1989), the Court of Appealsfor the Fifth Circuit followed an analogous course. Although
most of a liquid containing methamphetamine was waste material,

504ord$pt1 02-27-96 11:57:55 PGT*ORD1BV (Bound Volume)

935ORDERS
May 18, 1992504 U. S.
the Court of Appeals upheld the use of the weight of the wholesolution for sentencing purposes. Id., at 14, 15.

The issue is a recurring one. Because of the conflict, identicalconduct in violation of the same federal laws may give rise to
widely disparate sentences in different areas of the country. Iwould grant certiorari to resolve this conflict.

In Graham v. Collins, 950 F. 2d 1009 (1992) (en banc), cert.pending, No. 91-7580, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
rejected the claim advanced by the petitioner in this case by avote of 7 to 6. Obviously, the claim cannot be frivolous. At its
Conference on May 29, the Court will consider the petition forcertiorari in Graham, along with two other petitions raising the
same claim. In my opinion it is unseemly not to stay petitioner'sexecution until after that time so that his application and petition
receive at least the same consideration as will be given to thosewhose petitions for certiorari are now pending on the Conference

Justice White, dissenting.
Petitioner Larry Kinder presents three issues related to hisguilty plea and sentence for conspiring to possess methamphetamine with intent to distribute: (1) the burden of proof at thesentencing hearing; (2) District Court reliance on conduct made

the basis of counts dismissed pursuant to a plea bargain; and (3)Fifth Amendment self-incrimination implications of the acceptance of responsibility guideline, United States Sentencing Com-mission, Guidelines Manual $ 3E1.1 (Nov. 1992) (USSG). The
Courts of Appeals have come into conflict on each of these issues,which reflect important and recurring problems in procedures
under the Sentencing Guidelines. For the following reasons, Iwould grant the petition for certiorari as to each of these issues.

Petitioner was arrested following an undercover investigationinto major methamphetamine dealers in the area of Waco, Texas.
During the operation, petitioner expressed to an undercover offi-cer that he had not wanted to buy a large amount " `because he
had 17 ounces of methamphetamine on the street and had notcollected all of the money from the sale of [it].' " 946 F. 2d 362,
365 (CA5 1991). Instead, petitioner, with the assistance of hisbrother, David,

1 purchased approximately one-half pound (269

grams) of methamphetamine. Following his arrest, petitionerpleaded guilty to a one-count indictment of conspiring to possess

more than 100 grams of methamphetamine with intent to distrib-ute. 21 U. S. C. $$ 846 and 841(a)(1). In exchange for the plea,
the Government promised not to prosecute him for any additionaloffenses. At sentencing, however, when calculating the base offense level, the District Court included, upon recommendationby the Government, the noncharged 17 ounces (481.93 grams) of
methamphetamine of which petitioner had spoken. The DistrictCourt also declined to grant petitioner a downward adjustment
for acceptance of responsibility, in part because he refused toadmit to possession of this additional methamphetamine.

A
Before the Fifth Circuit, petitioner asserted that, when includ-ing the noncharged amounts of methamphetamine as relevant conduct which raised his base offense level from 26 to 30 points,the District Court relied on evidence lacking sufficient indicia of
reliability to meet the dictates of due process. See Townsend v.Burke, 334 U. S. 736, 741 (1948); USSG $ 6A1.3(a), p. s. (resolution
of disputed factors requires information with "sufficient indicia of

1 David Kinder's petition for certiorari, No. 91-6659, presented the same
issues raised by his brother here, and was denied on April 20, 1992, 503U. S. 987.

reliability to support its probable accuracy"). Petitioner arguedthat his statement was mere "puffery" that lacked corroboration,
emphasizing that he made such statements only to engender con-fidence in his distribution capabilities.

Like most Courts of Appeals, the Fifth Circuit requires districtcourts to determine their factual findings at sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence, which findings are reviewed on appealsolely for clear error. United States v. Angulo, 927 F. 2d 202,
205 (1991); see also United States v. Blanco, 888 F. 2d 907, 909(CA1 1989); United States v. Guerra, 888 F. 2d 247, 250-251 (CA2
1989), cert. denied, 494 U. S. 1090 (1990); United States v. Urrego-Linares, 879 F. 2d 1234, 1237-1238 (CA4), cert. denied, 493 U. S.
943 (1989); United States v. Carroll, 893 F. 2d 1502, 1506 (CA61990); United States v. White, 888 F. 2d 490, 499 (CA7 1989);
United States v. Frederick, 897 F. 2d 490, 491-493 (CA10), cert.denied, 498 U. S. 863 (1990); United States v. Alston, 895 F. 2d
1362, 1372-1373 (CA11 1990). However, at least one Circuit hasheld, United States v. Kikumura, 918 F. 2d 1084, 1098-1102 (CA3
1990), and two have suggested, United States v. Townley, 929F. 2d 365, 369-370 (CA8 1991); United States v. Restrepo, 946
F. 2d 654, 661, n. 12 (CA9 1991) (en banc), cert. denied, 503 U. S.961 (1992); Restrepo, 946 F. 2d, at 661-663 (Tang, J., concurring),
id., at 664-679 (Norris, J., dissenting), that a clear-and-convincing-evidence standard is appropriate when the relevant conduct offered at sentencing would dramatically increase the sentence.2Cf. id., at 663-664 (Pregerson, J., dissenting) (advocating beyondreasonable-doubt standard). However, even these Circuits recog-nize that the preponderance standard ordinarily pertains. See
United States v. McDowell, 888 F. 2d 285, 290-291 (CA3 1989);United States v. Sleet, 893 F. 2d 947, 949 (CA8 1990); United
States v. Wilson, 900 F. 2d 1350, 1353-1354 (CA9 1990).

2 Whether any Circuit would consider petitioner's heightened exposure
here "dramatic" is open to question. Petitioner had a criminal history cate-gory of IV. Brief in Opposition 4. Looking only to the increase in the

unadjusted base offense level from 26 to 30 shows an increase in his Guide-line range from 92-115 to 135-168 months of imprisonment. In real terms,
then, the District Court's acceptance of the controverted statement as proba-tive evidence for sentencing purposes exposed petitioner to roughly four
additional years' imprisonment--a 50% increase. Cf. United States v. Kiku-mura, 918 F. 2d 1084, 1102 (CA3 1990) (12-fold, 330-month departure from
the median of an applicable Guideline range).

White, J., dissenting946
In a marginal case, such a difference in the standard of reviewcould well prove dispositive, especially where, as in the Fifth
Circuit, "[a] defendant who objects to the use of information bearsthe burden of proving that it is `materially untrue, inaccurate or
unreliable.' " 946 F. 2d, at 366 (quoting Angulo, supra, at 205).The Sentencing Guidelines do not explicitly adopt a standard of
proof required for relevant conduct, and we have not visited thisissue since its new procedures took effect in November 1987. See
McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 91-93 (1986) (preponder-ance standard for sentencing enhancements satisfies due process).
The burden of proof at sentencing proceedings is an issue of dailyimportance to the district courts, with implications for all sentencing findings, whether they be the base offense level, specific of-fense characteristics, or any adjustments thereto, or even to those
facts found to warrant departure altogether. The resolution ofdisputed matters at sentencing obviously has serious implications
for both the defendant and the Government, as it controls thelength of sentence actually to be imposed. I would grant certiorari to clarify the applicable standards under the new sentenc-ing regime.

B
Petitioner also argued that the Government violated his pleaagreement not to prosecute him for additional offenses by recommending inclusion of the additional 17 ounces of methamphet-amine in sentencing.

3 The Fifth Circuit rejected this argument,

finding the Government to have kept its promise by prosecutingonly the 269 grams involved in the actual sale. "Inclusion of the

other 17 ounces in sentencing," the Fifth Circuit held, "is notequivalent to prosecution." 946 F. 2d, at 367 (citing United States
v. Rodriguez, 925 F. 2d 107, 112 (CA5 1991)); see also UnitedStates v. Kim, 896 F. 2d 678, 684 (CA2 1990); United States v.
Frierson, 945 F. 2d 650, 654-655 (CA3 1991), cert. denied, 503U. S. 952 (1992); United States v. Smallwood, 920 F. 2d 1231,

3 Petitioner's plea bargain in pertinent part stated: " `In exchange for Defendant's plea, the United States Attorney agrees to refrain from prosecut-ing Defendant for other Title 21, United States Code, violations of which the

United States is now aware, which may have been committed by the Defend-ant in the Western District of Texas. That is, this action now pending is
the extent of the Federal prosecution against the Defendant in the WesternDistrict of Texas based upon all facts at hand.' " Pet. for Cert. 15 (emphasis omitted).

White, J., dissenting 504 U. S.
1239-1240 (CA5), cert. denied, 501 U. S. 1238 (1991); United States
v. Jimenez, 928 F. 2d 356, 363-364 (CA10), cert. denied, 502 U. S.
854 (1991); United States v. Salazar, 909 F. 2d 1447, 1448-1449
(CA10 1990); United States v. Scroggins, 880 F. 2d 1204, 1212-1214
(CA11 1989). The Fifth Circuit also rejected petitioner's argument that the Government misrepresented that his base offense
level would be based only on 269 grams, finding instead that the
guilty plea was voluntary because the District Court informed
him of the maximum possible statutory punishment he faced. 946
F. 2d, at 367 (citing United States v. Pearson, 910 F. 2d 221, 223
(CA5 1990), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 1093 (1991)). To the contrary,
the Ninth Circuit has several times held that the Government
may not introduce counts dismissed as part of a plea bargain in
order to increase the sentence. United States v. Faulkner, 952
F. 2d 1066, 1069-1071 (1991); United States v. Fine, 946 F. 2d 650,
651-652 (1991); United States v. Castro-Cervantes, 927 F. 2d 1079,
1081-1082 (1991).

The issue is of considerable importance. Petitioner pleaded
guilty to conspiring to possess more than 100 grams of methamphetamine with intent to distribute, and with that plea he could
expect a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment,
with the possibility of a life term. 21 U. S. C. $ 841(b)(1)(A)(viii)
(1988 ed., Supp. II). As to this substantive count of conviction,
there is no distinction to be drawn between 269 grams and
751 grams of methamphetamine. But as to sentencing, the distinction is of the utmost importance, because where the exact
sentence will fall between 10 years and life depends largely on
the base offense level, USSG $ 2D1.1(a)(3), which derives solely
from the amounts listed in the Drug Quantity Table. Compare

$ 2D1.1(c)(7) (base offense level 30 for "[a]t least 700 G but less
than 1 KG of Methamphetamine") with $ 2D1.1(c)(9) (base offense
level 26 for "[a]t least 100 G but less than 400 G of Methamphetamine"). The question is whether a plea bargain that deletes
conduct from the offense of conviction nevertheless permits that
conduct to be fully punished in the sentence for the conviction
from which the conduct was supposedly deleted. Because this
substantial issue frequently recurs, and because of the apparent
conflict in the Circuits, I would grant certiorari on this issue
as well.

C
Finally, petitioner argued that the District Court erred in refusing to reduce his base offense level for acceptance of responsibility. See USSG $ 3E1.1. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the District
Court, finding, inter alia, that he "ha[s] denied [his] culpability
for any criminal conduct beyond the specific offense charged," and
specifically that he "continue[s] to deny any involvement in the
extra 17 ounces." 946 F. 2d, at 367. Petitioner protests that
requiring him to admit to incriminating conduct abridges the protections of the Fifth Amendment. The Fifth Circuit has disagreed with this assertion, see United States v. Mourning, 914
F. 2d 699, 706-707 (1990), as have the Fourth and Eleventh Circuits, see United States v. Gordon, 895 F. 2d 932, 936-937 (CA4),
cert. denied, 498 U. S. 846 (1990); United States v. Henry, 883
F. 2d 1010, 1011-1012 (CA11 1989). Firmly to the contrary are
the First, Second, and Ninth Circuits, which have determined
that conditioning the acceptance of responsibility reduction on
confession of uncharged conduct denies the defendant his right
against self-incrimination. United States v. Perez-Franco, 873
F. 2d 455 (CA1 1989); United States v. Oliveras, 905 F. 2d 623
(CA2 1990); United States v. Piper, 918 F. 2d 839, 840-841 (CA9
1990). See also United States v. Frierson, supra ($ 3E1.1 implicates Fifth Amendment protections, but defendant must invoke
the privilege and not simply lie in response to questioning regarding related conduct); United States v. Rogers, 899 F. 2d 917, 924
(CA10) (dictum approving Perez-Franco), cert. denied, 498 U. S.
839 (1990).

Amendments to this Guideline have not mended the split between the Circuits. Cf. Braxton v. United States, 500 U. S. 344
(1991). In any event, this is not a question of the mere application or simple interpretation of this Guideline, but is instead a
recurring issue of constitutional dimension, where the varying
conclusions of the Courts of Appeals determine the length of
sentence actually imposed. I would also grant certiorari on
this issue.

lies in the United States Court of Appeals or in this Court. Ithink it evident that the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction in such
a situation. Our cases have indicated that we narrowly view ourappellate jurisdiction in three-judge court cases pursuant to 28
U. S. C. $ 1253. See Gonzalez v. Automatic Employees CreditUnion, 419 U. S. 90, 96 (1974). We have thus declined to review
the actions, orders, and rulings of a single judge sitting on athree-judge court, see id., at 96, n. 14; dismissed an appeal of a
temporary restraining order by a single judge of a three-judgecourt for want of jurisdiction, see, e. g., Hicks v. Pleasure House,
Inc., 404 U. S. 1 (1971) (per curiam); and stated that a court ofappeals is not powerless to "give any guidance when a single
judge has erroneously invaded the province of a three-judgecourt," Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp. v. Epstein, 370 U. S.
713, 716 (1962) (per curiam). See also Schackman v. Arnebergh,387 U. S. 427 (1967) (per curiam). In light of these cases, I think
it clear that jurisdiction over a petition for mandamus in a casesuch as this rests in the first instance in the Court of Appeals.

I would grant the petition for writ of certiorari to resolve arecognized split among the Courts of Appeals on this issue.

Petitioner Samuel Waller and his stepfather, Gentry McKinney,were charged with 61 counts of structuring deposits to avoid
currency transaction reporting requirements and one count ofconspiring to commit those offenses. The District Court granted
petitioner's motion to sever his trial from that of McKinney. Inconnection with that motion, petitioner and the Government
agreed that McKinney would be tried by a jury prior to petition-er's trial. Petitioner agreed to waive his right to a jury trial and
to have a bench trial using the relevant evidence from McKinney'strial, as supplemented by any evidence adduced relative to petitioner's role in the offense.The same judge presided at both trials. McKinney was convicted on all counts in September 1989 and sentenced in December1989. As part of the sentencing record, the judge reviewed a
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) memorandum appended to
McKinney's presentence report. This memo alleged that McKin-ney and petitioner had been involved in drug trafficking and disclosed the full scope of criminal activity in which the Government
suspected petitioner and McKinney were involved. Petitionerwas later convicted after his bench trial in April 1990. Prior

to his sentencing in January 1991, petitioner received a copy ofhis presentence report, which also had the FBI memorandum
attached. Petitioner discovered that the District Court used thememo in McKinney's sentence and, consequently, that the judge
had read all of its prejudicial allegations about petitioner prior to
the time he presided at the bench trial.Petitioner moved for a new trial, alleging that the judge should

have disqualified himself, pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 455(a), becauseof the appearance of bias and partiality created by prior receipt
of the FBI memorandum and failure to disclose its existence prior
to bench trial. The District Court denied the motion because theprejudicial information about petitioner was not received from an

extrajudicial source, i. e., one independent of the prosecution ofpetitioner and McKinney. The judge acknowledged that the appearance of bias existed, but stated further that he did not believehe was in fact biased, that he either rejected or failed to recall
specific allegations from the memo during trial, and that he ignored any inadmissible evidence in adjudicating petitioner's guilt.

White, J., dissenting 504 U. S.
Relying on United States v. Monaco, 852 F. 2d 1143, 1147 (CA91988), cert. denied, 488 U. S. 1040 (1989), and United States v.
Winston, 613 F. 2d 221, 223 (CA9 1980), the Ninth Circuit affirmedin an unpublished opinion, holding that "[i]nformation obtained by
a judge through judicial duties in relation to one co-defendant . . .cannot serve to disqualify that judge from the subsequent trial of
another codefendant." App. to Pet. for Cert. A-4. The appellatecourt supported its conclusion by noting that the judge read the
memo more than five months prior to petitioner's bench trial andhad forgotten the significance and the specific allegations of the
memo; that a judge is presumed to ignore inadmissible evidencein deciding a case; and that petitioner agreed the judge could
consider evidence from McKinney's trial and was aware the judgewould have access to all information from those proceedings.
"Given these facts," the Ninth Circuit concluded, "we see no rea-sonable grounds for questioning [the trial judge's] impartiality
because of bias or prejudice." Id., at A-6.The Ninth Circuit explicitly rejected the First Circuit's contrary approach in United States v. Chantal, 902 F. 2d 1018 (1990),where the First Circuit emphasized that it "has repeatedly subscribed to what all commentators characterize as the correct viewthat . . . the source of the asserted bias/prejudice in a $ 455(a)
claim can originate explicitly in judicial proceedings," id., at 1022.See Panzardi-Alvarez v. United States, 879 F. 2d 975, 983-984
(CA1 1989); United States v. Kelley, 712 F. 2d 884, 889-890 (CA11983); United States v. Cepeda Penes, 577 F. 2d 754, 758 (CA1
1978); United States v. Cowden, 545 F. 2d 257, 265 (CA1 1976),cert. denied, 430 U. S. 909 (1977). The First Circuit has concluded
that the language of $ 455(a) is "automatic, mandatory and self-executing"; that "[i]t did away with the `duty to sit' doctrine";
and that "[i]t attacks the appearance of bias, not just bias in fact."Chantal, supra, at 1023. That the First Circuit would consider
appearances of judicial bias and prejudice originating in judicialproceedings conflicts not only with the Ninth Circuit, but also
with the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits. See UnitedStates v. Mitchell, 886 F. 2d 667, 671 (CA4 1989); United States
v. Merkt, 794 F. 2d 950, 960 (CA5 1986), cert. denied, 480 U. S.946 (1987); United States v. Sammons, 918 F. 2d 592, 599 (CA6
1990); McWhorter v. Birmingham, 906 F. 2d 674, 678 (CA11 1990).Here, the trial judge stated: " `I do believe that the appearance
of the question exists, and I think it is aggravated here by the factI allowed a waiver of the jury.' " Reply to Brief in Opposition 6

pretermitted any such consideration upon the conclusion that onlyextrajudicial sources can lead to reasonable questions about the
judge's impartiality, a rule that the First Circuit rejects.The statute itself gives no indication regarding the correct resolution of this recurring question. Because the Courts of Appealshave settled into differing interpretations of this statutory recusal

The Court once again declines to grant certiorari in a case inwhich the petitioners raise a subject of clear disagreement among

the Courts of Appeals. Once again, I dissent. The questionspresented concern whether Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983,
provides a cause of action for malicious prosecution and, if so,when the cause of action accrues.

Respondent was prosecuted for failing to repay a loan to pe-titioner First State Bank of Cleburne, Texas. The loan, for
more than $30,000, had been collateralized by the equipment andinventory of his stereo business. Respondent, who said that he
sold the inventory in the normal course of business, was indictedunder a provision of the Texas Penal Code that makes it a felony
to "remove" from the State collateral securing a debt. Tex. PenalCode Ann. $ 32.33 (1983). After three years of court appearances,
the charge was dismissed for insufficient evidence.Respondent sued the prosecuting attorneys, the county, the
bank, and certain bank employees, alleging that they conspiredto prosecute him maliciously in violation of state law and $ 1983.
The District Court dismissed the action as to the county and theprosecuting attorneys on immunity grounds and entered summary
judgment as to the remaining defendants on the ground that re-spondent's claims were time barred.

966 OCTOBER TERM, 1991

June 1, 1992 504 U. S.
The Court of Appeals reversed in relevant part.* Although itnoted that there has been considerable confusion in the Courts of
Appeals concerning the availability and contours of a $ 1983 mali-cious prosecution claim, see Brummett v. Camble[sic], 946 F. 2d
1178, 1180, n. 2 (CA5 1991) (collecting cases), the court observedthat recent Fifth Circuit cases "have assumed that malicious
prosecution violates $ 1983." Ibid. The court then held that re-spondent's claim was not time barred because a cause of action
for malicious prosecution under $ 1983 does not accrue until theunderlying prosecution has terminated in favor of the criminal
defendant. Id., at 1184.The Third, Sixth, and Tenth Circuits follow the rule that the
Fifth Circuit applied here. See Robinson v. Maruffi, 895 F. 2d649, 654 (CA10 1990); Rose v. Bartle, 871 F. 2d 331, 349 (CA3
1989); McCune v. Grand Rapids, 842 F. 2d 903, 907 (CA6 1988).However, the First Circuit has held that a malicious prosecution
claim accrues at the time of arrest and not when the allegedlyabusive proceeding comes to a conclusion, which may be years
later. Walden, III, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 576 F. 2d 945, 947, n. 5(1978). The Ninth Circuit's treatment of the question has been
inconsistent. Compare Cline v. Brusett, 661 F. 2d 108, 111 (1981)(following majority rule), with Gowin v. Altmiller, 663 F. 2d 820,
822 (1981) (following minority rule).Clearly, this is an area of law that requires our attention.
Therefore, I would grant certiorari to determine if a cause ofaction for malicious prosecution is available under $ 1983 and, if
it is, when the cause of action accrues.

cocaine dealer, but they got the wrong house. The question pre-sented is whether petitioner, the officer who drafted the search
warrant affidavit describing the house to be searched, is entitledto qualified immunity. Because the Court of Appeals applied the
wrong legal standard in answering that question, I would reversethe judgment and remand the case for further consideration.

Petitioner, a detective, received a tip from a confidential inform-ant that one Andres Villa had drugs in his home, one of several
small houses on an access road to a plant. The first building wasset back from the road, along a separate driveway. The informant did not count this structure when he told petitioner that Villalived in the second house on the right. Consequently, the warrant that petitioner obtained directed officers to go to the secondhouse on the right. The officers executing the warrant counted
differently, so they ended up at the wrong house.Respondents sued petitioner and others not party to this petition under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, alleging a violationof their Fourth Amendment rights. The District Court denied
petitioner's motion for summary judgment on grounds of qualifiedimmunity. The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding "that the
question in this case is whether a police officer in [petitioner's]position would reasonably have described the location with sufficient particularity to direct those executing the warrant to thecorrect house on the right" and "that it is for the jury to decide
whether [petitioner] acted reasonably . . . ." Navarro v. Barthel,952 F. 2d 331, 333 (CA9 1991) (per curiam).

The decision of the Court of Appeals was entered just a fewdays after our judgment in Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U. S. 224, 227
(1991), in which we explained that the appropriate inquiry waswhether a reasonable officer could have thought that he had acted
in accordance with the Constitution, and not whether an officerwould have acted otherwise (the standard applied by the Ninth
Circuit in Hunter and the present case). This distinction pro-vides "ample room for mistaken judgments," because qualified
immunity protects "all but the plainly incompetent or those whoknowingly violate the law." Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 343,
341 (1986), quoted in Hunter, supra, at 229.In Hunter we also reiterated the principle that questions of
immunity ordinarily should be decided by the court, not by thejury, 502 U. S., at 228, because "[t]he entitlement is an immunity
from suit rather than a mere defense to liability," Mitchell v.

Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 526 (1985). See Hunter, supra, at 227(collecting cases).

Because the Court of Appeals did not have the benefit of ourdecision in Hunter when it was deciding this case, I would summarily reverse the judgment and remand the case so the NinthCircuit may reexamine its decision in light of the correct legal
standards.

No. 108, Orig. Nebraska v. Wyoming et al. The Court byorder dated April 20, 1992 [503 U. S. 981], awarded the Special
Master interim compensation and reimbursement of expenses.The Court also allowed the parties and the proposed intervenors/
amici to comment further on the Special Master's suggestion ofa one-time special assessment of costs to the intervenors/amici.

Although different arguments have been advanced as to theappropriate amounts to be assessed, no party or proposed intervenor/amicus has objected to the propriety of including nonob-jecting amici in the assessment. We therefore do not reach the
issue, deeming the parties to have agreed with the procedure.The Special Master found that the proceedings were expanded
and made more costly by reason of amici participation, and theamici presumably acknowledge this to be the case. In light of
these considerations, the interim award to the Special Mastershall be paid as follows:

(1) the State of Colorado, a party to this original action, isassessed the amount of $25,000, the amount recommended by
the Special Master;
(2) the four proposed intervenors/amici, Basin ElectricPower Cooperative, Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District, the National Audubon Society, and the PlatteRiver Whooping Crane Critical Habitat Maintenance Trust,
are each assessed $5,000, an amount to which none have ob-jected; and
(3) the remaining award is to be paid 40% by Nebraska, 40%by Wyoming, and 20% by the United States.
Justice White would adopt the recommendation of the SpecialMaster respecting the allocation of his fees and expenses among
the parties and the amici. [For earlier order herein, see, e. g.,ante, p. 905.]

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
Because I do not believe that the Court has authority to assesscosts against nonparties, I respectfully dissent from the order to

the extent it provides for an assessment against amici curiae.1

liability"); Chance v. Board of Examiners, 70 F. R. D. 334, 340 (SDNY 1976).

I do not think that it is proper for the Court to justify its exerciseof this authority on the basis of the amici's failure to object,
especially when the assessment is for an interim payment to theSpecial Master in the course of an ongoing proceeding.

Justice White, dissenting.
The Court of Appeals held that the Interstate Agreement onDetainers Act (IAD), 18 U. S. C. App. $ 2, Art. IV(e), did not compel dismissal of the indictment against petitioner, who was takenfrom state custody in Massachusetts to Federal District Court on
a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum for arraignment on anunrelated crime and returned to state custody the same day. The
Courts of Appeals are divided as to the propriety of dismissalwhen technical violations of the IAD occur. Some courts take
the First Circuit's view that such violations do not merit dis-missal, see, e. g., United States v. Roy, 830 F. 2d 628, 636 (CA7
1987), cert. denied, 484 U. S. 1068 (1988); United States v. Roy,771 F. 2d 54, 60 (CA2 1985), cert. denied, 475 U. S. 1110 (1986);
Sassoon v. Stynchombe, 654 F. 2d 371, 374-375 (CA5 Unit B Aug.1981); but others do not, see, e. g., United States v. Thompson,
562 F. 2d 232, 234 (CA3 1977) (en banc), cert. denied, 436 U. S.949 (1978); United States v. Schrum, 638 F. 2d 214 (CA10 1981),
aff 'g 504 F. Supp. 23 (Kan. 1980). The Ninth Circuit has ex-pressly recognized this conflict, and sided with the position taken

One of the Court's duties is to do its best to see that the federallaw is not being applied differently in the various circuits around

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW--Continued.
II. Cruel and Unusual Punishment.

Death penalty--Weighing of invalid aggravating factors.--Trial court
committed Eighth Amendment error when it weighed as an aggravating
factor whether petitioner committed murder in a cold, calculated, and premeditated way, and that error went uncorrected by State Supreme Court
when it reviewed case. Sochor v. Florida, p. 527.

III. Discrimination Against Interstate Commerce.

1. Hazardous waste disposal fee--Out-of-state waste.--Alabama's imposition of a hazardous disposal fee on hazardous waste generated outside
State and disposed of at commercial facilities in State is a differential
treatment of out-of-state waste in violation of Commerce Clause. Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v. Hunt, p. 334.

2. Solid waste disposal--Out-of-state waste.--A Michigan law prohibiting private landfill operators from accepting solid waste that originates
outside of county in which their facilities are located unambiguously discriminates against interstate commerce and is appropriately characterized
as a protectionist measure that cannot withstand Commerce Clause scrutiny. Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Michigan Dept. of Natural
Resources, p. 353.

3. Use tax--Out-of-state mail-order house.--Enforcement of North Dakota statute requiring petitioner--an out-of-state mail-order house that
has neither outlets nor sales representatives in State--to collect and pay a
use tax on goods purchased for use within State places an unconstitutional
burden on interstate commerce. Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, p. 298.

IV. Due Process.

1. Death penalty--Voir dire.--Trial court's refusal to inquire, during
voir dire for a capital offense, whether potential jurors would automatically impose death penalty upon defendant's conviction was inconsistent
with Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Morgan v. Illinois,
p. 719.

2. Forced medication during trial--Trial rights.--Forced administration of antipsychotic medication during petitioner's capital murder trial
violated his due process rights because State failed to establish need for
medication and its medical appropriateness; it may also have impaired his
Sixth Amendment trial rights because of medication's effect on his appearance, testimony, and communication with counsel. Riggins v. Nevada,
p. 127.

3. Insanity acquittee--Standard for release.--Louisiana statute violated Due Process Clause where it allowed an insanity acquittee to be
committed to a mental institution until he was able to demonstrate that

he was not dangerous to himself and others, even though he did not suffer
from any mental illness. Foucha v. Louisiana, p. 71.

4. Use tax--Out-of-state mail-order house.--Due Process Clause does
not bar enforcement of North Dakota statute requiring petitioner--an outof-state mail-order house that has neither outlets nor sales representatives
in State--to collect and pay a use tax on goods purchased for use within
State; to extent that this Court's decisions have indicated that Clause requires a physical presence in a State, they are overruled. Quill Corp. v.
North Dakota, p. 298.

V. Equal Protection of the Laws.

Venue rules.--Montana's venue rules--which permit suit against a corporation incorporated in that State only in county of its principal place of
business, but permit suit in any county against a corporation incorporated
elsewhere--do not offend Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection
Clause. Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Ford, p. 648.

VI. Freedom of Expression and Association.

Write-in voting prohibition.--Hawaii's prohibition on write-in voting
does not unreasonably infringe upon its citizens' rights under First and
Fourteenth Amendments. Burdick v. Takushi, p. 428.

VII. Freedom of Speech.

Political speech--Polling places.--Tennessee Supreme Court's decision
that state law prohibiting solicitation of votes and display or distribution
of campaign materials within 100 feet of entrance to a polling place violated First and Fourteenth Amendments because 100-foot limit was not
narrowly tailored to protect, and was not least restrictive means to serve,
State's legitimate interest, is reversed. Burson v. Freeman, p. 191.

ment because Government failed to disclose to grand jury "substantial exculpatory evidence" in its possession. United States v. Williams,
p. 36.

3. Extortion--Hobbs Act--Inducement by public official.--An affirmative act of inducement by a public official, such as a demand, is not an
element of offense of extortion "under color of official right" prohibited by
Hobbs Act. Evans v. United States, p. 255.

4. Sentencing--Refusing to reduce sentence for substantial assistance.--Federal district courts have authority to review Government's refusal to file a motion requesting that a defendant's sentence be reduced
below statutory maximum because of his substantial assistance to Government and to grant a remedy if they find that refusal was based on an
unconstitutional motive; however, Wade failed to raise a claim of improper
motive. Wade v. United States, p. 188.

5. Stay of execution--Evidence of innocence.--Applicant was not entitled to a stay of execution where there was no basis for concluding that
he had produced substantial evidence of innocence. Coleman v. Thompson, p. 181.

for excusing a habeas petitioner's failure to develop a material fact in

alleged that her former spouse had abused their children; nor could court
abstain from entering judgment under abstention doctrine of Younger v.
