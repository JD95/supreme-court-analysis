CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 1993

VICTOR v. NEBRASKA
certiorari to the supreme court of nebraska
No. 92-8894. Argued January 18, 1994--Decided March 22, 1994*
The government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of

a charged offense. In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358. In upholding the first
degree murder convictions and death sentences of petitioners Sandoval
and Victor, the Supreme Courts of California and Nebraska, respectively, rejected contentions that due process was violated by the pattern
jury instructions defining "reasonable doubt" that were given in both
cases.

Held: Taken as a whole, the instructions in question correctly conveyed

the concept of reasonable doubt, and there is no reasonable likelihood
that the jurors understood the instructions to allow convictions based
on proof insufficient to meet the Winship standard. Pp. 5-23.

(a) The Constitution does not dictate that any particular form of
words be used in advising the jury of the government's burden of proof,
so long as "taken as a whole, the instructions correctly conve[y] the
concept of reasonable doubt," Holland v. United States, 348 U. S. 121,
140. In invalidating a charge declaring, among other things, that a reasonable doubt "must be such . . . as would give rise to a grave uncertainty," "is an actual substantial doubt," and requires "a moral certainty," the Court, in Cage v. Louisiana, 498 U. S. 39, 40, observed that

*Together with No. 92-9049, Sandoval v. California, on certiorari to
the Supreme Court of California.

2 VICTOR v. NEBRASKA

Syllabus
a reasonable juror could have interpreted the instruction to allow a
finding of guilt based on a degree of proof below that which is constitutionally required. However, in Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 72,
and n. 4, the Court made clear that the proper inquiry is not whether
the instruction "could have" been applied unconstitutionally, but
whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury did so apply it.
Pp. 5-6.

(b) The instructions given in Sandoval's case defined reasonable
doubt as, among other things, "not a mere possible doubt," but one "depending on moral evidence," such that the jurors could not say they
felt an abiding conviction, "to a moral certainty," of the truth of the
charge. Pp. 6-9.

(c) Sandoval's objection to the charge's use of the 19th century
phrases "moral evidence" and "moral certainty" is rejected. Although
the former phrase is not a mainstay of the modern lexicon, its meaning
today is consistent with its original meaning: evidence based on the
general observation of people, rather than on what is demonstrable. Its
use here is unproblematic because the instructions given correctly
pointed the jurors' attention to the facts of the case before them, not
(as Sandoval contends) the ethics or morality of his criminal acts. For
example, in the instruction declaring that "everything relating to human
affairs, and depending on moral evidence, is open to some possible or
imaginary doubt," moral evidence can only mean empirical evidence offered to prove matters relating to human affairs--the proof introduced
at trial. Similarly, whereas "moral certainty," standing alone, might
not be recognized by modern jurors as a synonym for "proof beyond a
reasonable doubt," its use in conjunction with the abiding conviction
language must be viewed as having impressed upon the jury the need
to reach the subjective state of near certitude of guilt, see Jackson v.
Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 315, and thus as not having invited conviction
on less than the constitutionally required proof. Moreover, in contrast
to the situation in Cage, there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury
here would have understood moral certainty to be disassociated from
the evidence in the case, since the instruction explicitly told the jurors,
among other things, that their conclusion had to be based upon such
evidence. Accordingly, although this Court does not condone the use of
the antiquated "moral certainty" phrase, its use in the context of the
instructions as a whole cannot be said to have rendered those instructions unconstitutional. Pp. 10-17.

(d) Sandoval's objection to the portion of the charge declaring that a
reasonable doubt is "not a mere possible doubt" is also rejected. That
the instruction properly uses "possible" in the sense of fanciful is made

Syllabus
clear by the fact that it also notes that everything "is open to some
possible or imaginary doubt." P. 17.

(e) The instructions given in Victor's case defined reasonable doubt
as, among other things, a doubt that will not permit an abiding conviction, "to a moral certainty," of the accused's guilt, and an "actual and
substantial doubt" that is not excluded by the "strong probabilities of
the case." Pp. 17-19.

(f) Victor's primary argument--that equating a reasonable doubt
with a "substantial doubt" overstated the degree of doubt necessary for
acquittal--is rejected. Any ambiguity is removed by reading the
phrase in question in context: The Victor charge immediately distinguished an "actual and substantial doubt" from one "arising from mere
possibility, from bare imagination, or from fanciful conjecture," and
thereby informed the jury that a reasonable doubt is something more
than a speculative one, which is an unexceptionable proposition. Cage,
supra, at 41, distinguished. Moreover, the instruction defined a reasonable doubt alternatively as a doubt that would cause a reasonable person
to hesitate to act, a formulation which this Court has repeatedly approved and which gives a commonsense benchmark for just how substantial a reasonable doubt must be. Pp. 19-21.

(g) The inclusion of the "moral certainty" phrase in the Victor charge
did not render the instruction unconstitutional. In contrast to the situation in Cage, a sufficient context to lend meaning to the phrase was
provided by the rest of the Victor charge, which equated a doubt sufficient to preclude moral certainty with a doubt that would cause a reasonable person to hesitate to act, and told the jurors that they must
have an abiding conviction of Victor's guilt, must be convinced of such
guilt "after full, fair, and impartial consideration of all the evidence,"
should be governed solely by that evidence in determining factual issues, and should not indulge in speculation, conjectures, or unsupported
inferences. Pp. 21-22.

(h) The reference to "strong probabilities" in the Victor charge does
not unconstitutionally understate the government's burden, since the
charge also informs the jury that the probabilities must be strong
enough to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See Dunbar v.
United States, 156 U. S. 185, 199. P. 22.

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.*
The government must prove beyond a reasonable doubtevery element of a charged offense.

In re Winship, 397 U. S.358 (1970). Although this standard is an ancient and honored aspect of our criminal justice system, it defies easy ex-plication. In these cases, we consider the constitutionality
of two attempts to define "reasonable doubt."

I
The beyond a reasonable doubt standard is a requirementof due process, but the Constitution neither prohibits trial

courts from defining reasonable doubt nor requires them todo so as a matter of course. Cf. Hopt v. Utah, 120 U. S. 430,
440-441 (1887). Indeed, so long as the court instructs thejury on the necessity that the defendant's guilt be proved
beyond a reasonable doubt, see Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S.307, 320, n. 14 (1979), the Constitution does not require that
any particular form of words be used in advising the jury ofthe government's burden of proof. Cf.

Taylor v. Kentucky,436 U. S. 478, 485-486 (1978). Rather, "taken as a whole,

the instructions [must] correctly conve[y] the concept of rea-sonable doubt to the jury." Holland v. United States, 348
U. S. 121, 140 (1954).In only one case have we held that a definition of reasonable doubt violated the Due Process Clause. Cage v. Louisiana, 498 U. S. 39 (1990) (per curiam). There, the jurorswere told:

" `[A reasonable doubt] is one that is founded upon a realtangible substantial basis and not upon mere caprice and
conjecture. It must be such doubt as would give riseto a grave uncertainty, raised in your mind by reasons
of the unsatisfactory character of the evidence or lackthereof. A reasonable doubt is not a mere possible

Opinion of the Court
doubt. It is an actual substantial doubt. It is a doubt
that a reasonable man can seriously entertain. What is
required is not an absolute or mathematical certainty,
but a moral certainty.' " Id., at 40 (emphasis added by

this Court in Cage).

We held that the highlighted portions of the instruction
rendered it unconstitutional:

"It is plain to us that the words `substantial' and `grave,'
as they are commonly understood, suggest a higher degree of doubt than is required for acquittal under the
reasonable doubt standard. When those statements are
then considered with the reference to `moral certainty,'
rather than evidentiary certainty, it becomes clear that
a reasonable juror could have interpreted the instruction to allow a finding of guilt based on a degree of proof
below that required by the Due Process Clause." Id.,
at 41.

In a subsequent case, we made clear that the proper inquiry is not whether the instruction "could have" been applied in an unconstitutional manner, but whether there is a
reasonable likelihood that the jury did so apply it. Estelle
v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 72, and n. 4 (1991). The constitutional question in the present cases, therefore, is whether
there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the
instructions to allow conviction based on proof insufficient to
meet the Winship standard. Although other courts have
held that instructions similar to those given at petitioners'
trials violate the Due Process Clause, see State v. Bryant,
334 N. C. 333, 432 S. E. 2d 291 (1993), cert. pending, No.
93-753; Morley v. Stenberg, 828 F. Supp. 1413 (Neb. 1993),
both the Nebraska and the California Supreme Courts held
that the instructions were constitutional. We granted certiorari, 509 U. S. 954 (1993), and now affirm both judgments.

Opinion of the Court

II
On October 14, 1984, petitioner Sandoval shot three men,
two of them fatally, in a gang-related incident in Los
Angeles. About two weeks later, he entered the home of a
man who had given information to the police about the murders and shot him dead; Sandoval then killed the man's wife
because she had seen him murder her husband. Sandoval
was convicted on four counts of first degree murder. The
jury found that Sandoval personally used a firearm in the
commission of each offense, and found the special circumstance of multiple murder. Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 12022.5
(West 1992) and Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 190.2(a)(3) (West
1988). He was sentenced to death for murdering the woman
and to life in prison without possibility of parole for the other
three murders. The California Supreme Court affirmed the
convictions and sentences. 4 Cal. 4th 155, 841 P. 2d 862
(1992).

The jury in Sandoval's case was given the following instruction on the government's burden of proof:

"A defendant in a criminal action is presumed to be
innocent until the contrary is proved, and in case of a
reasonable doubt whether his guilt is satisfactorily
shown, he is entitled to a verdict of not guilty. This
presumption places upon the State the burden of proving him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

"Reasonable doubt is defined as follows: It is not a
mere possible doubt; because everything relating to
human affairs, and depending on moral evidence, is open

to some possible or imaginary doubt. It is that state of
the case which, after the entire comparison and consideration of all the evidence, leaves the minds of the jurors
in that condition that they cannot say they feel an abiding conviction, to a moral certainty, of the truth of the
charge." App. in No. 92-9049, p. 49 (emphasis added)
(Sandoval App.).

8 VICTOR v. NEBRASKA

Opinion of the Court
The California Supreme Court rejected Sandoval's claim thatthe instruction, particularly the highlighted passages, violated the Due Process Clause. 4 Cal. 4th, at 185-186, 841P. 2d, at 878.

The instruction given in Sandoval's case has its genesis in
a charge given by Chief Justice Shaw of the MassachusettsSupreme Judicial Court more than a century ago:

"[W]hat is reasonable doubt? It is a term often used,
probably pretty well understood, but not easily defined.It is not mere possible doubt; because every thing relating to human affairs, and depending on moral evidence,
is open to some possible or imaginary doubt. It is thatstate of the case, which, after the entire comparison and

consideration of all the evidence, leaves the minds of ju-rors in that condition that they cannot say they feel an
abiding conviction, to a moral certainty, of the truth ofthe charge. The burden of proof is upon the prosecutor.
All the presumptions of law independent of evidence are
in favor of innocence; and every person is presumed tobe innocent until he is proved guilty. If upon such proof

there is reasonable doubt remaining, the accused is enti-tled to the benefit of it by an acquittal. For it is not
sufficient to establish a probability, though a strong onearising from the doctrine of chances, that the fact
charged is more likely to be true than the contrary; butthe evidence must establish the truth of the fact to a
reasonable and moral certainty; a certainty that convinces and directs the understanding, and satisfies thereason and judgment, of those who are bound to act

conscientiously upon it. This we take to be proof beyond reasonable doubt." Commonwealth v. Webster, 59
Mass. 295, 320 (1850).

The Webster charge is representative of the time when
"American courts began applying [the beyond a reasonable
doubt standard] in its modern form in criminal cases." Apo511us1$30J 11-03-97 16:58:40 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
daca v. Oregon, 406 U. S. 404, 412, n. 6 (1972) (plurality opinion). See also Perovich v. United States, 205 U. S. 86, 92
(1907) (approving Webster charge). In People v. Strong, 30
Cal. 151, 155 (1866), the California Supreme Court characterized the Webster instruction as "probably the most satisfactory definition ever given to the words `reasonable doubt'
in any case known to criminal jurisprudence." In People v.
Paulsell, 115 Cal. 6, 12, 46 P. 734 (1896), the court cautioned
state trial judges against departing from that formulation.
And in 1927, the state legislature adopted the bulk of the
Webster instruction as a statutory definition of reasonable
doubt. Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 1096 (West 1985); see California Jury Instructions, Criminal, No. 2.90 (4th ed. 1979). Indeed, the California Legislature has directed that "the court
may read to the jury section 1096 of this code, and no further
instruction on the subject of the presumption of innocence
or defining reasonable doubt need be given." $ 1096a. The
statutory instruction was given in Sandoval's case.

The California instruction was criticized in People v. Brigham, 25 Cal. 3d 283, 292-316, 599 P. 2d 100, 106-121 (1979)
(Mosk, J., concurring). Justice Mosk apparently did not
think the instruction was unconstitutional, but he "urge[d]
the Legislature to reconsider its codification." Id., at 293,
599 P. 2d, at 106. The California Assembly and Senate responded by requesting the committee on jury instructions of
the Los Angeles Superior Court "to study alternatives to
the definition of `reasonable doubt' set forth in Section 1096
of the Penal Code, and to report its findings and recommendations to the Legislature." Cal. Assem. Con. Res. No. 148,
1986 Cal. Stats. 5634. The committee recommended that
the legislature retain the statutory definition unmodified, see
Alternative Definitions of Reasonable Doubt: A Report of
the Committee on Standard Jury Instructions--Criminal to
the California Legislature (May 22, 1987), and $ 1096 has not
been changed.

10 VICTOR v. NEBRASKA

Opinion of the Court

A
Sandoval's primary objection is to the use of the phrases
"moral evidence" and "moral certainty" in the instruction.
As noted, this part of the charge was lifted verbatim from
Chief Justice Shaw's Webster decision; some understanding of the historical context in which that instruction was
written is accordingly helpful in evaluating its continuing
validity.

By the beginning of the Republic, lawyers had borrowed
the concept of "moral evidence" from the philosophers and
historians of the 17th and 18th centuries. See generally B.
Shapiro, "Beyond Reasonable Doubt" and "Probable Cause":
Historical Perspectives on the Anglo-American Law of Evidence, ch. 1 (1991). James Wilson, who was instrumental in
framing the Constitution and who served as one of the original Members of this Court, explained in a 1790 lecture on
law that "evidence . . . is divided into two species--demonstrative and moral." 1 Works of James Wilson 518 (J. Andrews ed. 1896). Wilson went on to explain the distinction
thus:

"Demonstrative evidence has for its subject abstract
and necessary truths, or the unchangeable relations of
ideas. Moral evidence has for its subject the real but
contingent truths and connections, which take place
among things actually existing. . . .. . . . .

"In moral evidence, there not only may be, but there
generally is, contrariety of proofs: in demonstrative evidence, no such contrariety can take place. . . . [T]o suppose that two contrary demonstrations can exist, is to
suppose that the same proposition is both true and false:
which is manifestly absurd. With regard to moral evidence, there is, for the most part, real evidence on both
sides. On both sides, contrary presumptions, contrary

testimonies, contrary experiences must be balanced."Id., at 518-519.

A leading 19th century treatise observed that "[m]atters offact are proved by moral evidence alone; . . . [i]n the ordinary
affairs of life, we do not require demonstrative evidence, . . .and to insist upon it would be unreasonable and absurd." 1
S. Greenleaf, Law of Evidence 3-4 (13th ed. 1876).The phrase "moral certainty" shares an epistemological
pedigree with moral evidence. See generally Shapiro, "ToA Moral Certainty": Theories of Knowledge and AngloAmerican Juries 1600-1850, 38 Hastings L. J. 153 (1986).Moral certainty was the highest degree of certitude based on
such evidence. In his 1790 lecture, James Wilson observed:

"In a series of moral evidence, the inference drawn inthe several steps is not necessary; nor is it impossible

that the premises should be true, while the conclusiondrawn from them is false.

". . . In moral evidence, we rise, by an insensiblegradation, from possibility to probability, and from
probability to the highest degree of moral certainty."1 Works of James Wilson,

supra, at 519.

At least one early treatise explicitly equated moral certaintywith proof beyond a reasonable doubt:

"Evidence which satisfies the minds of the jury of thetruth of the fact in dispute, to the entire exclusion of
every reasonable doubt, constitutes full proof of thefact. . . .

"Even the most direct evidence can produce nothingmore than such a high degree of probability as amounts
to moral certainty. From the highest degree it maydecline, by an infinite number of gradations, until

it produce in the mind nothing more than a mere pre-ponderance of assent in favour of the particular fact."

12 VICTOR v. NEBRASKA

Opinion of the Court
See also Greenleaf, supra, at 4 ("The most that can be affirmed of [things proved by moral evidence] is, that there is
no reasonable doubt concerning them").

Thus, when Chief Justice Shaw penned the Webster instruction in 1850, moral certainty meant a state of subjective
certitude about some event or occurrence. As the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court subsequently explained:

"Proof `beyond a reasonable doubt' . . . is proof `to a
moral certainty,' as distinguished from an absolute certainty. As applied to a judicial trial for crime, the two
phrases are synonymous and equivalent; each has been
used by eminent judges to explain the other; and each
signifies such proof as satisfies the judgment and consciences of the jury, as reasonable men, and applying
their reason to the evidence before them, that the crime
charged has been committed by the defendant, and so
satisfies them as to leave no other reasonable conclusion
possible." Commonwealth v. Costley, 118 Mass. 1, 24
(1875).

Indeed, we have said that "[p]roof to a `moral certainty'
is an equivalent phrase with `beyond a reasonable doubt.' "
Fidelity Mut. Life Assn. v. Mettler, 185 U. S. 308, 317 (1902),
citing Commonwealth v. Costley, supra. See also Wilson v.
United States, 232 U. S. 563, 570 (1914) (approving reasonable doubt instruction cast in terms of moral certainty);
Miles v. United States, 103 U. S. 304, 309, 312 (1881).

We recognize that the phrase "moral evidence" is not a
mainstay of the modern lexicon, though we do not think it
means anything different today than it did in the 19th century. The few contemporary dictionaries that define moral
evidence do so consistently with its original meaning. See,
e. g., Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary 1168 (2d
ed. 1979) ("based on general observation of people, etc.
rather than on what is demonstrable"); Collins English Dic511us1$30J 11-03-97 16:58:40 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tionary 1014 (3d ed. 1991) (similar); 9 Oxford English Diction-ary 1070 (2d ed. 1989) (similar).

Moreover, the instruction itself gives a definition of thephrase. The jury was told that "everything relating to
human affairs, and depending on moral evidence, is open to
some possible or imaginary doubt"--in other words, that ab-solute certainty is unattainable in matters relating to human

affairs. Moral evidence, in this sentence, can only mean em-pirical evidence offered to prove such matters--the proof introduced at trial.This conclusion is reinforced by other instructions given
in Sandoval's case. The judge informed the jurors that their
duty was "to determine the facts of the case from the evidence received in the trial and not from any other source."
Sandoval App. 38. The judge continued: "Evidence consists
of testimony of witnesses, writings, material objects, or anything presented to the senses and offered to prove the existence or non-existence of a fact." Id., at 40. The judge also
told the jurors that "you must not be influenced by pity for
a defendant or by prejudice against him," and that "[y]ou
must not be swayed by mere sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public opinion or public feeling."
Id., at 39. These instructions correctly pointed the jurors'
attention to the facts of the case before them, not (as Sandoval contends) the ethics or morality of Sandoval's criminal
acts. Accordingly, we find the reference to moral evidence
unproblematic.

We are somewhat more concerned with Sandoval's argument that the phrase "moral certainty" has lost its historical
meaning, and that a modern jury would understand it to
allow conviction on proof that does not meet the beyond a
reasonable doubt standard. Words and phrases can change
meaning over time: A passage generally understood in 1850
may be incomprehensible or confusing to a modern juror.
And although some contemporary dictionaries contain definitions of moral certainty similar to the 19th century under511us1$30J 11-03-97 16:58:40 PAGES OPINPGT
14 VICTOR v. NEBRASKA

Opinion of the Court
standing of the phrase, see Webster's Third New Inter-national Dictionary 1468 (1981) ("virtual rather than actual, immediate, or completely demonstrable"); 9 Oxford Eng-lish Dictionary,

supra, at 1070 ("a degree of probability so
great as to admit of no reasonable doubt"), we are willing to
accept Sandoval's premise that "moral certainty," standingalone, might not be recognized by modern jurors as a synonym for "proof beyond a reasonable doubt." But it doesnot necessarily follow that the California instruction is
unconstitutional.Sandoval first argues that moral certainty would be understood by modern jurors to mean a standard of proof lower
than beyond a reasonable doubt. In support of this proposition, Sandoval points to contemporary dictionaries that define moral certainty in terms of probability. E. g., Webster's
New Twentieth Century Dictionary, supra, at 1168 ("based
on strong probability"); Random House Dictionary of the
English Language 1249 (2d ed. 1983) ("resting upon convincing grounds of probability"). But the beyond a reasonable
doubt standard is itself probabilistic. "[I]n a judicial proceeding in which there is a dispute about the facts of some
earlier event, the factfinder cannot acquire unassailably accurate knowledge of what happened. Instead, all the factfinder can acquire is a belief of what probably happened."
In re Winship, 397 U. S., at 370 (Harlan, J., concurring) (emphasis in original). The problem is not that moral certainty
may be understood in terms of probability, but that a jury
might understand the phrase to mean something less than
the very high level of probability required by the Constitution in criminal cases.

Although in this respect moral certainty is ambiguous in
the abstract, the rest of the instruction given in Sandoval's
case lends content to the phrase. The jurors were told that
they must have "an abiding conviction, to a moral certainty,
of the truth of the charge." Sandoval App. 49. An instruction cast in terms of an abiding conviction as to guilt, without

Opinion of the Court
reference to moral certainty, correctly states the government's burden of proof. Hopt v. Utah, 120 U. S., at 439
("The word `abiding' here has the signification of settled and
fixed, a conviction which may follow a careful examination
and comparison of the whole evidence"); see Criminal Jury
Instructions: District of Columbia 46 (3d H. Greene & T.
Guidoboni ed. 1978). And the judge had already informed
the jury that matters relating to human affairs are proved
by moral evidence, see supra, at 13; giving the same meaning
to the word moral in this part of the instruction, moral certainty can only mean certainty with respect to human affairs.
As used in this instruction, therefore, we are satisfied that
the reference to moral certainty, in conjunction with the
abiding conviction language, "impress[ed] upon the factfinder
the need to reach a subjective state of near certitude of the
guilt of the accused." Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S., at 315.
Accordingly, we reject Sandoval's contention that the moral
certainty element of the California instruction invited the
jury to convict him on proof below that required by the Due
Process Clause.

Sandoval's second argument is a variant of the first. Accepting that the instruction requires a high level of confidence in the defendant's guilt, Sandoval argues that a juror
might be convinced to a moral certainty that the defendant
is guilty even though the government has failed to prove
his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. A definition of moral
certainty in a widely used modern dictionary lends support
to this argument, see American Heritage Dictionary 1173 (3d
ed. 1992) ("Based on strong likelihood or firm conviction,
rather than on the actual evidence"), and we do not gainsay
its force. As we have noted, "[t]he constitutional standard
recognized in the Winship case was expressly phrased as one
that protects an accused against a conviction except on `proof
beyond a reasonable doubt.' " Jackson v. Virginia, supra,
at 315 (emphasis in original). Indeed, in Cage we contrasted

511us1$30J 11-03-97 16:58:40 PAGES OPINPGT
16 VICTOR v. NEBRASKA

Opinion of the Court
"moral certainty" with "evidentiary certainty." 498 U. S.,at 41.

But the moral certainty language cannot be sequesteredfrom its surroundings. In the

Cage instruction, the jurors
were simply told that they had to be morally certain of the
defendant's guilt; there was nothing else in the instructionto lend meaning to the phrase. Not so here. The jury in

Sandoval's case was told that a reasonable doubt is "thatstate of the case which,

after the entire comparison and consideration of all the evidence, leaves the minds of the jurorsin that condition that they cannot say they feel an abiding

conviction, to a moral certainty, of the truth of the charge."
Sandoval App. 49 (emphasis added). The instruction thus
explicitly told the jurors that their conclusion had to be based
on the evidence in the case. Other instructions reinforced
this message. The jury was told "to determine the facts of
the case from the evidence received in the trial and not from
any other source." Id., at 38. The judge continued that
"you must not be influenced by pity for a defendant or by
prejudice against him. . . . You must not be swayed by mere
sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public
opinion or public feeling." Id., at 39. Accordingly, there is
no reasonable likelihood that the jury would have understood
moral certainty to be disassociated from the evidence in the
case.

We do not think it reasonably likely that the jury understood the words "moral certainty" either as suggesting a
standard of proof lower than due process requires or as
allowing conviction on factors other than the government's
proof. At the same time, however, we do not condone the
use of the phrase. As modern dictionary definitions of
moral certainty attest, the common meaning of the phrase
has changed since it was used in the Webster instruction, and
it may continue to do so to the point that it conflicts with
the Winship standard. Indeed, the definitions of reasonable
doubt most widely used in the federal courts do not contain

17Cite as: 511 U. S. 1 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
any reference to moral certainty. See Federal Judicial Cen-ter, Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions 28 (1988); 1 E. Devitt & C. Blackmar, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions$ 11.14 (3d ed. 1977). But we have no supervisory power
over the state courts, and in the context of the instructionsas a whole we cannot say that the use of the phrase rendered
the instruction given in Sandoval's case unconstitutional.

B
Finally, Sandoval objects to the portion of the charge inwhich the judge instructed the jury that a reasonable doubt

is "not a mere possible doubt." The Cage instruction in-cluded an almost identical reference to "not a mere possible
doubt," but we did not intimate that there was anythingwrong with that part of the charge. See 498 U. S., at 40.
That is because "[a] `reasonable doubt,' at a minimum, is onebased upon `reason.' "

Jackson v. Virginia, supra, at 317.A fanciful doubt is not a reasonable doubt. As Sandoval's

defense attorney told the jury: "Anything can be possible. . . . [A] planet could be made out of blue cheese. But that's
really not in the realm of what we're talking about." Sando-val App. 79 (excerpt from closing argument). That this is
the sense in which the instruction uses "possible" is madeclear from the final phrase of the sentence, which notes that
everything "is open to some possible or imaginary doubt."We therefore reject Sandoval's challenge to this portion of
the instruction as well. III

On December 26, 1987, petitioner Victor went to theOmaha home of an 82-year-old woman for whom he occasionally did gardening work. Once inside, he beat her with apipe and cut her throat with a knife, killing her. Victor was
convicted of first degree murder. A three-judge panel foundthe statutory aggravating circumstances that Victor had
previously been convicted of murder, Neb. Rev. Stat. $ 29-2523(1)(a) (1989), and that the murder in this case was espe511us1$30J 11-03-97 16:58:40 PAGES OPINPGT

cially heinous, atrocious, and cruel, $ 29-2523(1)(d). Findingnone of the statutory mitigating circumstances, the panel

sentenced Victor to death. The Nebraska Supreme Courtaffirmed the conviction and sentence.

State v. Victor, 235
Neb. 770, 457 N. W. 2d 431 (1990), cert. denied, 498 U. S.
1127 (1991).At Victor's trial, the judge instructed the jury that "[t]he

burden is always on the State to prove beyond a reasonabledoubt all of the material elements of the crime charged, and
this burden never shifts." App. in No. 92-8894, p. 8 (VictorApp.). The charge continued:

" `Reasonable doubt' is such a doubt as would cause areasonable and prudent person, in one of the graver and
more important transactions of life, to pause and hesi-tate before taking the represented facts as true and relying and acting thereon. It is such a doubt as will notpermit you, after full, fair, and impartial consideration
of all the evidence, to have an abiding conviction, to a
moral certainty, of the guilt of the accused. At thesame time, absolute or mathematical certainty is not required. You may be convinced of the truth of a factbeyond a reasonable doubt and yet be fully aware that
possibly you may be mistaken. You may find an ac-cused guilty upon the

strong probabilities of the case,
provided such probabilities are strong enough to excludeany doubt of his guilt that is reasonable. A reasonable

doubt is an actual and substantial doubt reasonably
arising from the evidence, from the facts or circum-stances shown by the evidence, or from the lack of evidence on the part of the State, as distinguished from a
doubt arising from mere possibility, from bare imagination, or from fanciful conjecture." Id., at 11 (emphasis
added).

On state postconviction review, the Nebraska Supreme
Court rejected Victor's contention that the instruction, par511us1$30J 11-03-97 16:58:40 PAGES OPINPGT

ticularly the emphasized phrases, violated the Due ProcessClause. 242 Neb. 306, 310-311, 494 N. W. 2d 565, 569 (1993).

Because the last state court in which review could be hadconsidered Victor's constitutional claim on the merits, it is
properly presented for our review despite Victor's failure toobject to the instruction at trial or raise the issue on direct
appeal. See, e. g., Ylst v. Nunnemaker, 501 U. S. 797, 801(1991).

The instruction given in Victor's case can be traced totwo separate lines of cases. Much of the charge is taken
from Chief Justice Shaw's Webster instruction. See Carrv.

State, 23 Neb. 749, 752-753, 37 N. W. 630, 631-632 (1888)(approving the use of

Webster). The rest derives from aseries of decisions approving instructions cast in terms of

an "actual doubt" that would cause a reasonable person tohesitate to act. See, e. g., Whitney v. State, 53 Neb. 287,
298, 73 N. W. 696, 699 (1898); Willis v. State, 43 Neb. 102,110-111, 61 N. W. 254, 256 (1894); Polin v. State, 14 Neb.
540, 546-547, 16 N. W. 898, 900-901 (1883). In 1968, acommittee appointed by the Nebraska Supreme Court developed model jury instructions; a court rule in effect at thetime Victor was tried directed that those instructions were
to be used where applicable. Nebraska Jury Instructions ix(1969) (N. J. I.). The model instruction on reasonable doubt,
N. J. I. 14.08, is the one given at Victor's trial. (Since Victorwas tried, a revised reasonable doubt instruction, N. J. I. 2d
Crim. 2.0 (1992), has been adopted, although the prior ver-sion may still be used.)

A
Victor's primary argument is that equating a reasonabledoubt with a "substantial doubt" overstated the degree of

doubt necessary for acquittal. We agree that this construc-tion is somewhat problematic. On the one hand, "substantial" means "not seeming or imaginary"; on the other, itmeans "that specified to a large degree." Webster's Third
New International Dictionary, at 2280. The former is un511us1$30J 11-03-97 16:58:40 PAGES OPINPGT
20 VICTOR v. NEBRASKA

Opinion of the Court
exceptionable, as it informs the jury only that a reasonabledoubt is something more than a speculative one; but the latter could imply a doubt greater than required for acquittalunder

Winship. Any ambiguity, however, is removed by
reading the phrase in the context of the sentence in which it
appears: "A reasonable doubt is an actual and substantialdoubt . . .

as distinguished from a doubt arising from mere
possibility, from bare imagination, or from fanciful conjec-ture." Victor App. 11 (emphasis added).

This explicit distinction between a substantial doubt anda fanciful conjecture was not present in the

Cage instruction.
We did say in that case that "the words `substantial' and
`grave,' as they are commonly understood, suggest a higher
degree of doubt than is required for acquittal under the reasonable doubt standard." 498 U. S., at 41. But we did not
hold that the reference to substantial doubt alone was sufficient to render the instruction unconstitutional. Cf. Taylor
v. Kentucky, 436 U. S., at 488 (defining reasonable doubt as a
substantial doubt, "though perhaps not in itself reversible
error, often has been criticized as confusing") (emphasis
added). Rather, we were concerned that the jury would
interpret the term "substantial doubt" in parallel with the
preceding reference to "grave uncertainty," leading to an
overstatement of the doubt necessary to acquit. In the
instruction given in Victor's case, the context makes clear
that "substantial" is used in the sense of existence rather
than magnitude of the doubt, so the same concern is not
present.

In any event, the instruction provided an alternative definition of reasonable doubt: a doubt that would cause a reasonable person to hesitate to act. This is a formulation we
have repeatedly approved, Holland v. United States, 348
U. S., at 140; cf. Hopt v. Utah, 120 U. S., at 439-441, and to
the extent the word "substantial" denotes the quantum of
doubt necessary for acquittal, the hesitate to act standard
gives a commonsense benchmark for just how substantial

21Cite as: 511 U. S. 1 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
such a doubt must be. We therefore do not think it reason-ably likely that the jury would have interpreted this instruction to indicate that the doubt must be anything other thana reasonable one.

B
Victor also challenges the "moral certainty" portion of theinstruction. In another case involving an identical instruction, the Nebraska Supreme Court distinguished Cage as fol-lows: "[U]nder the

Cage instruction a juror is to vote forconviction unless convinced to a moral certainty that there

exists a reasonable doubt, whereas under the questioned in-struction a juror is to vote for acquittal unless convinced to
a moral certainty that no reasonable doubt exists." State v.
Morley, 239 Neb. 141, 155, 474 N. W. 2d 660, 670 (1991); seealso 242 Neb., at 310-311, 494 N. W. 2d, at 569 (relying on

Morley). We disagree with this reading of Cage. Themoral certainty to which the

Cage instruction referred wasclearly related to the defendant's guilt; the problem in Cage

was that the rest of the instruction provided insufficient con-text to lend meaning to the phrase. But the Nebraska instruction is not similarly deficient.Instructing the jurors that they must have an abiding conviction of the defendant's guilt does much to alleviate anyconcerns that the phrase "moral certainty" might be misunderstood in the abstract. See supra, at 14-15. The instruc-tion also equated a doubt sufficient to preclude moral certainty with a doubt that would cause a reasonable person tohesitate to act. In other words, a juror morally certain of a
fact would not hesitate to rely on it; and such a fact can fairlybe said to have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Cf.
Hopt v. Utah, supra, at 439-440. The jurors were told thatthey must be convinced of Victor's guilt "after full, fair, and
impartial consideration of all the evidence." Victor App. 11.The judge also told them: "In determining any questions of
fact presented in this case, you should be governed solely bythe evidence introduced before you. You should not indulge

22 VICTOR v. NEBRASKA

Opinion of the Court
in speculation, conjectures, or inferences not supported bythe evidence."

Id., at 2. There is accordingly no reasonable likelihood that the jurors understood the reference to
moral certainty to allow conviction on a standard insufficient
to satisy Winship, or to allow conviction on factors other
than the government's proof. Though we reiterate that we
do not countenance its use, the inclusion of the "moral certainty" phrase did not render the instruction given in Victor's case unconstitutional.

C

Finally, Victor argues that the reference to "strong probabilities" in the instruction unconstitutionally understated the
government's burden. But in the same sentence, the instruction informs the jury that the probabilities must be
strong enough to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. We upheld a nearly identical instruction in
Dunbar v. United States, 156 U. S. 185, 199 (1895): "While
it is true that [the challenged instruction] used the words
`probabilities' and `strong probabilities,' yet it emphasized
the fact that those probabilities must be so strong as to exclude any reasonable doubt, and that is unquestionably the
law" (citing Hopt v. Utah, supra, at 439). That conclusion
has lost no force in the course of a century, and we therefore
consider Dunbar controlling on this point.

IV
The Due Process Clause requires the government to prove
a criminal defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and
trial courts must avoid defining reasonable doubt so as to
lead the jury to convict on a lesser showing than due process
requires. In these cases, however, we conclude that "taken
as a whole, the instructions correctly conveyed the concept
of reasonable doubt to the jury." Holland v. United States,
supra, at 140. There is no reasonable likelihood that the
jurors who determined petitioners' guilt applied the instruc511us1$30J 11-03-97 16:58:40 PAGES OPINPGT

tions in a way that violated the Constitution. The judg-ments in both cases are accordingly

Affirmed.
Justice Kennedy, concurring.
It was commendable for Chief Justice Shaw to pen an
instruction that survived more than a century, but, as the
Court makes clear, what once might have made sense tojurors has long since become archaic. In fact, some of the

phrases here in question confuse far more than they clarify.Though the reference to "moral certainty" is not much better, California's use of "moral evidence" is the most trou-bling, and to me seems quite indefensible. The derivation
of the phrase is explained in the Court's opinion, but evenwith this help the term is a puzzle. And for jurors who have
not had the benefit of the Court's research, the words will
do nothing but baffle.I agree that use of "moral evidence" in the California formulation is not fatal to the instruction here. I cannot understand, however, why such an unruly term should be used at
all when jurors are asked to perform a task that can be of
great difficulty even when instructions are altogether clear.
The inclusion of words so malleable, because so obscure,
might in other circumstances have put the whole instruction
at risk.

With this observation, I concur in full in the opinion of
the Court.

Justice Ginsburg, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.

I agree with the Court that the reasonable doubt instructions given in these cases, read as a whole, satisfy the Constitution's due process requirement. As the Court observes,
the instructions adequately conveyed to the jurors that they
should focus exclusively upon the evidence, see ante, at 13,
16, 21-22, and that they should convict only if they had an

"abiding conviction" of the defendant's guilt, see ante, at14, 21. I agree, further, with the Court's suggestion that

the term "moral certainty," while not in itself so misleadingas to render the instructions unconstitutional, should be
avoided as an unhelpful way of explaining what reasonabledoubt means. See

ante, at 16, 22.Similarly unhelpful, in my view, are two other features of

the instruction given in Victor's case. That instruction be-gins by defining reasonable doubt as "such a doubt as would
cause a reasonable and prudent person, in one of the graverand more important transactions of life, to pause and hesitate before taking the represented facts as true and relyingand acting thereon." App. in No. 92-8894, p. 11. A committee of distinguished federal judges, reporting to the Judi-cial Conference of the United States, has criticized this "hesitate to act" formulation

"because the analogy it uses seems misplaced. In thedecisions people make in the most important of their

own affairs, resolution of conflicts about past events doesnot usually play a major role. Indeed, decisions we
make in the most important affairs of our lives--choos-ing a spouse, a job, a place to live, and the like--generally involve a very heavy element of uncertainty andrisk-taking. They are wholly unlike the decisions jurors ought to make in criminal cases." Federal JudicialCenter, Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions 18-19 (1987)
(commentary on instruction 21).
More recently, Second Circuit Chief Judge Jon O. Newmanobserved:

"Although, as a district judge, I dutifully repeated [the`hesitate to act' standard] to juries in scores of criminal
trials, I was always bemused by its ambiguity. If thejurors encounter a doubt that would cause them to `hesitate to act in a matter of importance,' what are they todo then? Should they decline to convict because they

have reached a point of hesitation, or should they simplyhesitate, then ask themselves whether, in their own private matters, they would resolve the doubt in favor ofaction, and, if so, continue on to convict?" Beyond
"Reasonable Doubt," 68 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 201, 204 (1994)(James Madison Lecture, delivered at New York University Law School, Nov. 9, 1993).
Even less enlightening than the "hesitate to act" formula-tion is the passage of the

Victor instruction counseling: "[Thejury] may find an accused guilty upon the strong probabilities

of the case, provided such probabilities are strong enough
to exclude any doubt of his guilt that is reasonable." App.in No. 92-8894, p. 11. If the italicized words save this part

of the instruction from understating the prosecution's bur-den of proof, see ante, at 22, they do so with uninstructive
circularity. Jury comprehension is scarcely advanced whena court "defines" reasonable doubt as "doubt . . . that is
reasonable."These and similar difficulties have led some courts to question the efficacy of any reasonable doubt instruction. Atleast two of the Federal Courts of Appeals have admonished
their District Judges not to attempt a definition.* ThisCourt, too, has suggested on occasion that prevailing definitions of "reasonable doubt" afford no real aid. See, e. g.,Holland v. United States, 348 U. S. 121, 140 (1954) (" `[a]ttempts to explain the term "reasonable doubt" do not usuallyresult in making it any clearer to the minds of the jury' "),

*See, e. g., United States v. Adkins, 937 F. 2d 947, 950 (CA4 1991) ("This
circuit has repeatedly warned against giving the jury definitions of reasonable doubt, because definitions tend to impermissibly lessen the burden of
proof. . . . The only exception to our categorical disdain for definition is
when the jury specifically requests it."); United States v. Hall, 854 F. 2d
1036, 1039 (CA7 1988) (upholding District Court's refusal to provide definition, despite jury's request, because "at best, definitions of reasonable
doubt are unhelpful to a jury . . . . An attempt to define reasonable doubt
presents a risk without any real benefit.").

quoting Miles v. United States, 103 U. S. 304, 312 (1881);
Hopt v. Utah, 120 U. S. 430, 440-441 (1887) ("The rule may
be, and often is, rendered obscure by attempts at definition,which serve to create doubts instead of removing them.").

But we have never held that the concept of reasonable doubt
is undefinable, or that trial courts should not, as a matter ofcourse, provide a definition. Nor, contrary to the Court's

suggestion, see ante, at 5, have we ever held that the Consti-tution does not require trial courts to define reasonable
doubt.Because the trial judges in fact defined reasonable doubt
in both jury charges we review, we need not decide whether
the Constitution required them to do so. Whether or not
the Constitution so requires, however, the argument for defining the concept is strong. While judges and lawyers are
familiar with the reasonable doubt standard, the words "beyond a reasonable doubt" are not self-defining for jurors.
Several studies of jury behavior have concluded that "jurors
are often confused about the meaning of reasonable doubt"
when that term is left undefined. See Note, Defining Reasonable Doubt, 90 Colum. L. Rev. 1716, 1723 (1990) (citing
studies). Thus, even if definitions of reasonable doubt are
necessarily imperfect, the alternative--refusing to define the
concept at all--is not obviously preferable. Cf. Newman,
supra, at 205-206 ("I find it rather unsettling that we are
using a formulation that we believe will become less clear
the more we explain it.").

Fortunately, the choice need not be one between two kinds
of potential juror confusion--on one hand, the confusion that
may be caused by leaving "reasonable doubt" undefined, and
on the other, the confusion that might be induced by the
anachronism of "moral certainty," the misplaced analogy of
"hesitation to act," or the circularity of "doubt that is reasonable." The Federal Judicial Center has proposed a definition of reasonable doubt that is clear, straightforward, and
accurate. That instruction reads:

Opinion of Ginsburg, J.
"[T]he government has the burden of proving the de-fendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Some of you

may have served as jurors in civil cases, where you weretold that it is only necessary to prove that a fact is more
likely true than not true. In criminal cases, the govern-ment's proof must be more powerful than that. It must
be beyond a reasonable doubt."Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves
you firmly convinced of the defendant's guilt. Thereare very few things in this world that we know with
absolute certainty, and in criminal cases the law doesnot require proof that overcomes every possible doubt.
If, based on your consideration of the evidence, you arefirmly convinced that the defendant is guilty of the
crime charged, you must find him guilty. If on theother hand, you think there is a real possibility that he
is not guilty, you must give him the benefit of the doubtand find him not guilty." Federal Judicial Center, Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions, at 17-18 (instruction21).

This instruction plainly informs the jurors that the prosecu-tion must prove its case by more than a mere preponderance
of the evidence, yet not necessarily to an absolute certainty.The "firmly convinced" standard for conviction, repeated for
emphasis, is further enhanced by the juxtaposed prescriptionthat the jury must acquit if there is a "real possibility" that
the defendant is innocent. This model instruction surpassesothers I have seen in stating the reasonable doubt standard
succinctly and comprehensibly.I recognize, however, that this Court has no supervisory
powers over the state courts, see ante, at 17, and that thetest we properly apply in evaluating the constitutionality of
a reasonable doubt instruction is not whether we find it ex-emplary; instead, we inquire only whether there is a "reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instructio[n] toallow conviction based on proof insufficient to meet" the rea511us1$30P 11-03-97 16:58:41 PAGES OPINPGT

sonable doubt standard. See ante, at 6. On that under-standing, I join Parts II, III-B, and IV of the Court's opinion

and concur in its judgment.

Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Souter joinsin all but Part II, concurring in part and dissenting in part.

In Cage v. Louisiana, 498 U. S. 39 (1990), this Court, by a
per curiam opinion, found a jury instruction defining reason-able doubt so obviously flawed that the resulting state-court

judgment deserved summary reversal. The majority todaypurports to uphold and follow Cage, but plainly falters in its
application of that case. There is no meaningful differencebetween the jury instruction delivered at Victor's trial and
the jury instruction issued in Cage, save the fact that thejury instruction in Victor's case did not contain the two
words "grave uncertainty." But the mere absence of thesetwo words can be of no help to the State, since there is other
language in the instruction that is equally offensive to dueprocess. I therefore dissent from the Court's opinion and
judgment in No. 92-8894, Victor v. Nebraska.

I
Our democracy rests in no small part on our faith in theability of the criminal justice system to separate those who

are guilty from those who are not. This is a faith whichsprings fundamentally from the requirement that unless
guilt is established beyond all reasonable doubt, the accusedshall go free. It was not until 1970, however, in

In reWinship, 397 U. S. 358, that the Court finally and explicitly

held that "the Due Process Clause protects the accusedagainst conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable
doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime withwhich he is charged."

Id., at 364. In Winship, the Courtrecounted the long history of the reasonable-doubt standard,

noting that it "dates at least from our early years as a Na511us1$30F 11-03-97 16:58:41 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
tion." Id., at 361. The Court explained that any "society
that values the good name and freedom of every individual
should not condemn a man for commission of a crime when
there is a reasonable doubt about his guilt." Id., at 363-364.

Despite the inherent appeal of the reasonable-doubt standard, it provides protection to the innocent only to the extent
that the standard, in reality, is an enforceable rule of law.
To be a meaningful safeguard, the reasonable-doubt standard
must have a tangible meaning that is capable of being understood by those who are required to apply it. It must be
stated accurately and with the precision owed to those whose
liberty or life is at risk. Because of the extraordinarily high
stakes in criminal trials, "[i]t is critical that the moral force
of the criminal law not be diluted by a standard of proof
that leaves people in doubt whether innocent men are being
condemned." Id., at 364.

When reviewing a jury instruction that defines "reasonable doubt," it is necessary to consider the instruction as a
whole and to give the words their common and ordinary
meaning. Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 72 (1991). It is
not sufficient for the jury instruction merely to be susceptible to an interpretation that is technically correct. The important question is whether there is a "reasonable likelihood"
that the jury was misled or confused by the instruction, and
therefore applied it in a way that violated the Constitution.
Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, 380 (1990). Any jury instruction defining "reasonable doubt" that suggests an improperly high degree of doubt for acquittal or an improperly
low degree of certainty for conviction offends due process.
Either misstatement of the reasonable-doubt standard is
prejudicial to the defendant, as it "vitiates all the jury's findings," see Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275, 281 (1993)
(emphasis deleted), and removes the only constitutionally appropriate predicate for the jury's verdict.

30 VICTOR v. NEBRASKA

Opinion of Blackmun, J.

A
In a Louisiana trial court, Tommy Cage was convicted offirst-degree murder and sentenced to death. On appeal to

the Supreme Court of Louisiana, he argued, among otherthings, that the reasonable-doubt instruction used in the
guilt phase of his trial violated the Due Process Clause ofthe Fourteenth Amendment. See

State v. Cage, 554 So. 2d39 (1989). The instruction in relevant part provided:

"If you entertain a reasonable doubt as to any fact orelement necessary to constitute the defendant's guilt, it
is your duty to give him the benefit of that doubt andreturn a verdict of not guilty. Even where the evidence
demonstrates a probability of guilt, if it does not estab-lish such guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, you must acquit the accused. This doubt, however, must be a rea-sonable one; that is one that is founded upon a real
tangible substantial basis and not upon mere caprice andconjecture. It must be such a doubt as would give rise
to a grave uncertainty, raised in your mind by reasonsof the unsatisfactory character of the evidence or lack
thereof. A reasonable doubt is not a mere possibledoubt. It is an actual substantial doubt. It is a doubt
that a reasonable man can seriously entertain. What isrequired is not an absolute or mathematical certainty,
but a moral certainty." Id., at 41 (second emphasisadded; first and third emphases in original).

The Louisiana Supreme Court affirmed Cage's conviction,reasoning that, although some of the language "might overstate the requisite degree of uncertainty and confuse thejury," the charge as a whole was understandable to "reasonable persons of ordinary intelligence," and therefore consti-tutional.

Ibid.We granted certiorari and summarily reversed. Cage v.

Louisiana, 498 U. S. 39 (1990). The Court noted that someof the language in the instruction was adequate, but ruled

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
that the phrases "actual substantial doubt" and "grave un-certainty" suggested a "higher degree of doubt than is required for acquittal under the reasonable-doubt standard,"and that those phrases taken together with the reference to
"moral certainty," rather than "evidentiary certainty," rendered the instruction as a whole constitutionally defective.
Id., at 41.

Clarence Victor, petitioner in No. 92-8894, also was con-victed of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. The

instruction in his case reads as follows:

" `Reasonable doubt' is such a doubt as would cause a
reasonable and prudent person, in one of the graver andmore important transactions of life, to pause and hesitate before taking the represented facts as true and re-lying and acting thereon. It is such a doubt as will not
permit you, after full, fair, and impartial considerationof all the evidence, to have an abiding conviction, to a
moral certainty, of the guilt of the accused. At the
same time absolute or mathematical certainty is not re-quired.

You may be convinced of the truth of a fact
beyond a reasonable doubt and yet be fully aware that
possibly you may be mistaken. You may find an accused guilty upon the strong probabilities of the case,provided such probabilities are strong enough to exclude

any doubt of his guilt that is reasonable. A reasonabledoubt is an

actual and substantial doubt reasonably
arising from the evidence, from the facts or circumstances shown by the evidence, or from the lack of evi-dence on the part of the State, as distinguished from a

doubt arising from mere possibility, from bare imagination, or from fanciful conjecture." App. in No. 92-8894,
p. 11 (emphases added).

The majority's attempt to distinguish this instruction from
the one employed in Cage is wholly unpersuasive. Both instructions equate "substantial doubt" with reasonable doubt,

32 VICTOR v. NEBRASKA

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
and refer to "moral certainty" rather than "evidentiary cer-tainty." And although Victor's instruction does not contain

the phrase "grave uncertainty," the instruction contains lan-guage that has an equal potential to mislead, including the
invitation to the jury to convict based on the "strong proba-bilities" of the case and the overt effort to dissuade jurors
from acquitting when they are "fully aware that possiblythey may be mistaken." Nonetheless, the majority argues
that "substantial doubt" has a meaning in Victor's instruc-tion different from that in Cage's instruction, and that the
"moral certainty" language is sanitized by its context. Themajority's approach seems to me to fail under its own logic.

B
First, the majority concedes, as it must, that equating rea-sonable doubt with substantial doubt is "somewhat problematic" since one of the common definitions of "substantial" is" `that specified to a large degree.' " Ante, at 19. But the
majority insists that the jury did not likely interpret theword "substantial" in this manner because Victor's instruction, unlike Cage's instruction, used the phrase "substantialdoubt" as a means of distinguishing reasonable doubt from
mere conjecture. According to the majority, "[t]his explicitdistinction between a substantial doubt and a fanciful conjecture was not present in the Cage instruction," and thus, readin context, the use of "substantial doubt" in Victor's instruction is less problematic. Ante, at 20.A casual reading of the

Cage instruction reveals the major-ity's false premise. The Cage instruction plainly states that

a reasonable doubt is a doubt "founded upon a real tangiblesubstantial basis and not upon mere caprice and conjecture."
See 498 U. S., at 40. The Cage instruction also used the"substantial doubt" language to distinguish a reasonable
doubt from "a mere possible doubt." Ibid. (" `A reasonabledoubt is not a mere possible doubt.

It is an actual substan-tial doubt' "). Thus, the reason the Court condemned the

511us1$30F 11-03-97 16:58:41 PAGES OPINPGT

33Cite as: 511 U. S. 1 (1994)
Opinion of Blackmun, J.
"substantial doubt" language in Cage had nothing to do withthe absence of appropriate contrasting language; rather, the

Court condemned the language for precisely the reason itgave: "[T]he words `substantial' and `grave,' as they are commonly understood, suggest a higher degree of doubt than is
required for acquittal under the reasonable doubt standard."
Id., at 41. In short, the majority's speculation that the jury
in Victor's case interpreted "substantial" to mean somethingother than "that specified to a large degree" simply because

the word "substantial" is used at one point to distinguishmere conjecture is unfounded and is foreclosed by

Cage itself.
The majority further attempts to minimize the obvioushazards of equating "substantial doubt" with reasonable

doubt by suggesting that, in Cage, it was the combined use
of "substantial doubt" and "grave uncertainty," "in parallel,"that rendered the use of the phrase "substantial doubt" unconstitutional. Ante, at 20. This claim does not withstandscrutiny. The Court in

Cage explained that both "substantial doubt" and "grave uncertainty" overstated the degree ofdoubt necessary to acquit, and found that it was the use of

those words in conjunction with the misleading phrase"moral certainty" that violated due process. The Court's
exact words were:

"It is plain to us that the words `substantial' and `grave,'
as they are commonly understood, suggest a higher de-gree of doubt than is required for acquittal under the

reasonable doubt standard. When those statements are
then considered with the reference to `moral certainty,'rather than evidentiary certainty, it becomes clear that

a reasonable juror could have interpreted the instruction to allow a finding of guilt based on a degree of proof
below that required by the Due Process Clause." 498
U. S., at 41.

Clearly, the Court was not preoccupied with the relationship
between "substantial doubt" and "grave uncertainty." The

34 VICTOR v. NEBRASKA

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
Court instead endorsed the universal opinion of the Courts
of Appeals that equating reasonable doubt with "substantial
doubt" is improper and potentially misleading in that it overstates the degree of doubt required for acquittal under the
reasonable-doubt standard. See, e. g., Smith v. Bordenkircher, 718 F. 2d 1273, 1276 (CA4 1983) (noting agreement with
the "uniformly disapproving" view of the appellate courts
regarding the use of the "substantial doubt" language), cert.
denied, 466 U. S. 976 (1984); see also Taylor v. Kentucky,
436 U. S. 478, 488 (1978) ("[Equating `substantial doubt' with
reasonable doubt], though perhaps not in itself reversible
error, often has been criticized as confusing").*

In a final effort to distinguish the use of the phrase "substantial doubt" in this case from its use in Cage, the majority
states: "In any event, the instruction provided an alternative
definition of reasonable doubt: a doubt that would cause a
reasonable person to hesitate to act." Ante, at 20. The
Court reasons that since this formulation has been upheld in
other contexts, see Holland v. United States, 348 U. S. 121,
140 (1954), this "alternative" statement makes it unlikely
that the jury would interpret "substantial" to mean "to a
large degree."

To begin with, I note my general agreement with Justice
Ginsburg's observation that the "hesitate to act" language
is far from helpful, and may in fact make matters worse by
analogizing the decision whether to convict or acquit a defendant to the frequently high-risk personal decisions people
must make in their daily lives. See ante, at 24 (opinion

*Despite the overwhelming disapproval of the use of the phrase "substantial doubt" by appellate courts, some state trial courts continue to
employ the language when instructing jurors. See Bordenkircher, 718 F.
2d, at 1279 (dissenting opinion) ("As the majority has forthrightly pointed
out, a `good and substantial doubt' instruction has evoked a `uniformly
disapproving' response from appellate courts . . . . Evidently the slight
slaps on the wrist followed by affirmance of the convictions have not
served the hoped for end of correction of the error in futuro").

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
concurring in part and concurring in judgment). But evenassuming this "hesitate to act" language is in some way helpful to a jury in understanding the meaning of reasonabledoubt, the existence of an "alternative" and accurate definition of reasonable doubt somewhere in the instruction does
not render the instruction lawful if it is "reasonably likely"that the jury would rely on the faulty definition during its

deliberations. Boyde, 494 U. S., at 380. Cage itself con-tained proper statements of the law with respect to what is
required to convict or acquit a defendant, but this languagecould not salvage the instruction since it remained reasonably likely that, despite the proper statements of law, the
jury understood the instruction to require "a higher degree
of doubt than is required for acquittal under the reasonable
doubt standard." 498 U. S., at 41.

In my view, the predominance of potentially misleading
language in Victor's instruction made it likely that the jury
interpreted the phrase "substantial doubt" to mean that a
"large" doubt, as opposed to a merely reasonable doubt, is
required to acquit a defendant. It seems that a central purpose of the instruction is to minimize the jury's sense of responsibility for the conviction of those who may be innocent.
The instruction goes out of its way to assure jurors that
"[y]ou may be convinced of the truth of a fact beyond a reasonable doubt and yet be fully aware that possibly you may
be mistaken"; and then, after acquainting jurors with the
possibility that their consciences will be unsettled after convicting the defendant, the instruction states that the jurors
should feel free to convict based on the "strong probabilities
of the case." Viewed as a whole, the instruction is geared
toward assuring jurors that although they may be mistaken,
they are to make their decision on those "strong probabilities," and only a "substantial doubt" of a defendant's guilt
should deter them from convicting.

The majority dismisses the potentially harmful effects of
the "strong probabilities" language on the ground that a

511us1$30F 11-03-97 16:58:41 PAGES OPINPGT
36 VICTOR v. NEBRASKA

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
"nearly identical instruction" was upheld by the Court a cen-tury ago. See

ante, at 22, citing Dunbar v. United States,
156 U. S. 185, 199 (1895). But the instruction in Dunbar didnot equate reasonable doubt with "substantial doubt," nor

did it contain the phrase "moral certainty." As the majority
appreciates elsewhere in its opinion, challenged jury instruc-tions must be considered in their entirety.

Ante, at 5, quoting Holland, 348 U. S., at 140 (" `[T]aken as a whole, the in-structions [must] correctly conve[y] the concept of reasonable

doubt to the jury' "). Rather than examining the jury in-struction as a whole, the majority parses it, ignoring the relationship between the challenged phrases as well as their
cumulative effect.

Considering the instruction in its entirety, it seems fairly
obvious to me that the "strong probabilities" language increased the likelihood that the jury understood "substantial
doubt" to mean "to a large degree." Indeed, the jury could
have a reasonable doubt about a defendant's guilt but still
find that the "strong probabilities" are in favor of conviction.
Only when a reasonable doubt is understood to be a doubt
"to a large degree" does the "strong probabilities" language
begin to make sense. A Nebraska Federal District Court
recently observed: "The word `probability' brings to mind
terms such as `chance,' `possibility,' `likelihood' and `plausibility'--none of which appear to suggest the high level of certainty which is required to be convinced of a defendant's
guilt `beyond a reasonable doubt.' " Morley v. Stenberg, 828
F. Supp. 1413, 1422 (1993). All of these terms, however, are
consistent with the interpretation of "substantial doubt" as
a doubt "to a large degree." A jury could have a large and
reasonable doubt about a defendant's guilt but still find the
defendant guilty on "the strong probabilities of the case,"
believing it "likely" that the defendant committed the crime
for which he was charged.

To be sure, the instruction does qualify the "strong probabilities" language by noting that "the strong probabilities of

511us1$30F 11-03-97 16:58:41 PAGES OPINPGT

37Cite as: 511 U. S. 1 (1994)
Opinion of Blackmun, J.
the case" should be "strong enough to exclude any doubt ofhis guilt that is reasonable." But this qualification is useless

since a "doubt of his guilt that is reasonable" is immediatelydefined, in the very next sentence, as a "substantial doubt."
Thus, the supposed clarification only compounds the confusion by referring the jury to the "substantial doubt" phraseas a means of defining the "strong probabilities" language.

Finally, the instruction issued in Victor's case states thata reasonable doubt "is such a doubt as will not permit you,
after full, fair, and impartial consideration of all the evidence,to have an abiding conviction,

to a moral certainty, of the
guilt of the accused." In Cage, the Court disapproved of
the use of the phrase "moral certainty," because of the real
possibility that such language would lead jurors reasonably
to believe that they could base their decision to convict upon
moral standards or emotion in addition to or instead of evidentiary standards. The risk that jurors would understand
"moral certainty" to authorize convictions based in part on
value judgments regarding the defendant's behavior is particularly high in cases where the defendant is alleged to have
committed a repugnant or brutal crime. In Cage, we therefore contrasted "moral certainty" with "evidentiary certainty," and held that where "moral certainty" is used in conjunction with "substantial doubt" and "grave uncertainty,"
the Due Process Clause is violated. 498 U. S., at 41.

Just as in Cage, the "moral certainty" phrase in Victor's
instruction is particularly dangerous because it is used in
conjunction with language that overstates the degree of
doubt necessary to convict. This relationship between the
"moral certainty" language, which potentially understates
the degree of certainty required to convict, and the "substantial doubt," "strong probabilities," and "possibly you may be
mistaken" language which, especially when taken together,
overstates the degree of doubt necessary to acquit, also distinguishes Victor's instruction from the one challenged in
No. 92-9049, Sandoval v. California. See ante, at 7. The

38 VICTOR v. NEBRASKA

Opinion of Blackmun, J.
jury instruction defining reasonable doubt in Sandoval usedthe phrases "moral certainty" and "moral evidence," but the

phrases were not used in conjunction with language of thetype at issue here--language that easily may be interpreted
as overstating the degree of doubt required to acquit. Inother words, in Victor's instruction, unlike Sandoval's, all of
the misleading language is mutually reinforcing, both over-stating the degree of doubt necessary to acquit and understating the degree of certainty required to convict.This confusing and misleading state of affairs leads me ineluctably to the conclusion that, in Victor's case, there existsa reasonable likelihood that the jury believed that a lesser
burden of proof rested with the prosecution; and, moreover,it prevents me from distinguishing the jury instruction challenged in Victor's case from the one issued in Cage. As withthe Cage instruction, it simply cannot be said that Victor's
instruction accurately informed the jury as to the degree ofcertainty required for conviction and the degree of doubt
required for acquittal. Where, as here, a jury instructionattempts but fails to convey with clarity and accuracy the
meaning of reasonable doubt, the reviewing court shouldreverse the conviction and remand for a new trial. See
Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U. S., at 277-288. I would va-cate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nebraska and
remand the case. II

Although I concur in the Court's opinion in No. 92-9049,
Sandoval v. California, I dissent from the Court's affirm-ance of the judgment in that case. Adhering to my view

that the death penalty cannot be imposed fairly within theconstraints of our Constitution, see my dissent in

Callins v.Collins, 510 U. S. 1141, 1143 (1994), I would vacate the sentence of death in Sandoval. And, in view of my dissentin Callins, I also would vacate the sentence of death in
No. 92-8894, Victor v. Nebraska, even if I believed that theunderlying conviction withstood constitutional scrutiny.

39OCTOBER TERM, 1993
Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. GRANDERSON
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 92-1662. Argued January 10, 1994--Decided March 22, 1994
Respondent Granderson, a letter carrier, pleaded guilty to one count of

destruction of mail. The potential imprisonment range for that crime
was 0-6 months under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. The
District Court imposed no prison time, sentencing Granderson instead
to five years' probation and a fine. After Granderson tested positive
for cocaine, the court resentenced him under 18 U. S. C. $ 3565(a), which
provides that if a person serving a sentence of probation possesses illegal drugs, "the court shall revoke the sentence of probation and sentence the defendant to not less than one-third of the original sentence."
Accepting the Government's reading of the statute, the District Court
concluded that the phrase "original sentence" referred to the term of
probation actually imposed (60 months), rather than the 0-6 month
imprisonment range authorized by the Guidelines. Accordingly, that
court resentenced Granderson to 20 months' imprisonment. The Court
of Appeals upheld the revocation of Granderson's probation, but vacated
his new sentence. Invoking the rule of lenity, the court agreed with
Granderson that "original sentence" referred to the potential imprisonment range under the Guidelines, not to the actual probation sentence.
Because Granderson had already served 11 months of his revocation
sentence--more than the 6-months maximum under the Guidelines--the
court ordered him released from custody.

Held: The minimum revocation sentence under $ 3565(a)'s drug-possession

proviso is one-third the maximum of the originally applicable Guidelines
range of imprisonment, and the maximum revocation sentence is the
Guidelines maximum. Pp. 44-57.

(a) The Government is correct that the proviso mandates imprisonment, not renewed probation, as the required type of punishment. The
contrast in $$ 3565(a)(1) and (2) between "continu[ing]" and "revok[ing]"
probation as the alternative punishments for a defendant who violates
a probation condition suggests that a revocation sentence must be a
sentence of imprisonment, not a continuation of probation. Moreover,
it would be absurd to punish drug-possessing probationers by revoking
their probation and imposing a new term of probation no longer than
the original. However, the Government contends incorrectly that the

Syllabus
the term of probation. The statutory language appears to differentiate,
not to equate or amalgamate, "the sentence of probation" and "the original sentence." The Government's interpretation, furthermore, reads
the proviso's word "sentence" inconsistently. Pp. 44-47.

(b) Under Granderson's reading of the proviso, the "original sentence" that sets the duration of the revocation sentence is the applicable
Guidelines sentence of imprisonment, not the revoked term of probation.
That reading avoids both the linguistic anomalies presented by the Government's construction and the sentencing disparities that would attend
the Government's interpretation. Furthermore, contrary to the Government's arguments, Granderson's reading satisfies the statute's purpose by treating the class of drug possessors more severely than other
probation violators, and the proviso need not be interpreted in pari
materia with the discrete, differently worded provision prescribing revocation of the supervised release of drug possessors. Moreover, the
proviso's history furnishes additional cause to resist the Government's
interpretation, for it indicates that the proviso may not have received
Congress' careful attention and may have been composed with an obsolete federal sentencing regime in the drafters' minds. In these circumstances, where the text, structure, and statutory history fail to establish that the Government's position is unambiguously correct, the
rule of lenity operates to resolve the statutory ambiguity in Granderson's favor. Pp. 47-54.

(c) The benchmark for the revocation sentence under the proviso is
the maximum Guidelines sentence of imprisonment. Pp. 54-56.

(d) Because Granderson's maximum revocation sentence under the
proviso was 6 months, and because he had already served 11 months
imprisonment at the time the Court of Appeals issued its decision, that
court correctly ordered his release. Pp. 56-57.

Gregory S. Smith, by appointment of the Court, 510 U. S.806, argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief

was Stephanie Kearns.*

Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents a question of statutory interpretationregarding revocation of a federal sentence of probation.

The law at issue provides that if a person serving a sentenceof probation possesses illegal drugs, "the court shall revoke
the sentence of probation and sentence the defendant to notless than one-third of the original sentence." 18 U. S. C.

$ 3565(a). Congress did not further define the critical term"original sentence," nor are those words, unmodified, used
elsewhere in the Federal Criminal Code chapter on sen-tencing. Embedded in that context, the words "original
sentence" in $ 3565(a) are susceptible to at least threeinterpretations.

Read in isolation, the provision could be taken to mean thereimposition of a sentence of probation, for a period not less
than one-third of the original sentence of probation. Thisconstruction, however, is implausible, and has been urged by
neither party, for it would generally demand no increasedsanction, plainly not what Congress intended.

The Government, petitioner here, reads the provision todraw the time period from the initially imposed sentence of
probation, but to require incarceration, not renewed proba-tion, for not less than one-third of that period. On the Government's reading, accepted by the District Court, respond-ent Granderson would face a 20-month mandatory minimum
sentence of imprisonment.Granderson maintains that "original sentence" refers to
the sentence of incarceration he could have received initially,

42 UNITED STATES v. GRANDERSON

Opinion of the Court
in lieu of the sentence of probation, under the United StatesSentencing Guidelines. Granderson's construction calls for

a 2-month mandatory minimum. The Court of Appeals ac-cepted Granderson's interpretation, see 969 F. 2d 980 (CA11
1992); returns in other Circuits are divided.1The "original sentence" prescription of $ 3565(a) was a
late-hour addition to the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, asprawling enactment that takes up 364 pages in the Statutes
at Large. Pub. L. 100-690, 102 Stat. 4181-4545. The provi-sion appears not to have received Congress' careful attention. It may have been composed, we suggest below, withthe pre-1984 federal sentencing regime in the drafters'
minds; it does not easily adapt to the regime established bythe Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.

According the statute a sensible construction, we recog-nize, in common with all courts that have grappled with the
"original sentence" conundrum, that Congress prescribedimprisonment as the type of punishment for drug-possessing
probationers.2 As to the duration of that punishment, werest on the principle that " `the Court will not interpret a
federal criminal statute so as to increase the penalty . . .when such an interpretation can be based on no more than a

originally available under the United States Sentencing Guidelines), with

961 F. 2d 1399 (CA8 1992); United States v. Corpuz, 953 F. 2d 526 (CA9
1992) (all reading "original sentence" to refer to the term of the revoked
probation).

2 The interpretation offered by Justice Kennedy--a reduced sentence

of probation as the mandatory minimum--is notable for its originality.
No court that has essayed construction of the prescription at issue has
come upon the answer Justice Kennedy finds clear in "the text and
structure of the statute." Post, at 60, 68. But cf. post, at 67 (describing
the statute as "far from transparent").

guess as to what Congress intended.' " Bifulco v. UnitedStates, 447 U. S. 381, 387 (1980), quoting Ladner v. United

States, 358 U. S. 169, 178 (1958). We therefore adopt Grand-erson's interpretation and affirm the judgment of the Court
of Appeals.

I

Granderson, a letter carrier, pleaded guilty to one countof destruction of mail, in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 1703(a).

Under the Sentencing Guidelines, the potential imprisonment range, derived from the character of the offense andthe offender's criminal history category, was 0-6 months.

The District Court imposed no prison time, but sentencedGranderson to five years' probation and a $2,000 fine.

3 As a

standard condition of probation, Granderson was required tosubmit periodically to urinary testing for illegal drug use.

Several weeks after his original sentencing, Grandersontested positive for cocaine, and his probation officer petitioned for revocation of the sentence of probation. Findingthat Granderson had possessed cocaine, the District Court
revoked Granderson's sentence of probation and undertookto resentence him, pursuant to $ 3565(a), to incarceration for
"not less than one-third of the original sentence." The term
"original sentence," the District Court concluded, referredto the term of probation actually imposed (60 months) rather

than the imprisonment range authorized by the Guidelines(0-6 months). The court accordingly sentenced Granderson
to 20 months' imprisonment.The Court of Appeals upheld the revocation of the sentence of probation but vacated Granderson's new sentence.969 F. 2d 980 (CA11 1992). That court observed that the
probation revocation sentence of 20 months' imprisonment
imposed by the District Court was far longer than the sen3 The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, for the first time, classified probation as a sentence; before 1984, probation had been considered an alternative to a sentence. See S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 88 (1983).

Opinion of the Court
tence that could have been imposed either for the underlyingcrime of destroying mail (six months) or for the crime of

cocaine possession (one year). Id., at 983, and n. 2. TheCourt of Appeals called it "legal alchemy" to convert an
"original sentence" of " `conditional liberty,' " with a corre-spondingly long term, into a sentence of imprisonment with a
time span geared to the lesser restraint. Id., at 984, quoting
United States v. Gordon, 961 F. 2d 426, 432 (CA3 1992). In-voking the rule of lenity, 969 F. 2d, at 983, the court concluded that the phrase "original sentence" referred to "the[0-6 month] sentence of incarceration faced by Granderson
under the Guidelines," not to the 60-month sentence ofprobation,

id., at 984. Because Granderson had served 11months of his revocation sentence--more than the 6-month

maximum--the Court of Appeals ordered him released fromcustody. Id., at 985.

II
The text of $ 3565(a) reads:

"If the defendant violates a condition of probation at anytime prior to the expiration or termination of the term

of probation, the court may . . ."(1) continue him on probation, with or without extending the term or modifying [or] enlarging the condi-tions; or

"(2) revoke the sentence of probation and impose anyother sentence that was available . . . at the time of the
initial sentencing.
"Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, ifa defendant is found by the court to be in possession of

a controlled substance . . . the court shall revoke thesentence of probation and sentence the defendant to not
less than one-third of the original sentence." (Empha-sis added.)

The Government argues that the italicized proviso isunambiguous. The "original sentence" that establishes the

Opinion of the Court
benchmark for the revocation sentence, the Government as-serts, can only be the very sentence actually imposed,

i. e.,
the sentence of probation. In this case, the sentence of pro-bation was 60 months; "one-third of the original sentence"

is thus 20 months. But for two reasons, the Government
continues, Granderson's 20-month revocation sentence mustbe one of imprisonment rather than probation. First, the

contrast in subsections (1) and (2) between "continu[ing]"and "revok[ing]" probation suggests that a revocation sentence must be a sentence of imprisonment, not a continuationof probation. Second, the Government urges, it would be
absurd to "punish" drug-possessing probationers by revok-ing their probation and imposing a new term of probation no
longer than the original. Congress could not be taken to
have selected drug possessors, from the universe of all pro-bation violators, for more favorable treatment, the Government reasons, particularly not under a provision enacted as
part of a statute called "The Anti-Drug Abuse Act."

We agree, for the reasons stated by the Government, that
a revocation sentence must be a term of imprisonment. Otherwise the proviso at issue would make little sense.4 We do
not agree, however, that the term "original sentence" relates
to the duration of the sentence set for probation. The statute provides that if a probationer possesses drugs, "the court

4 Justice Kennedy's novel interpretation would authorize revocation
sentences under which drug possessors could profit from their violations.
The present case is an example. The District Court determined, just over
4 months into Granderson's 60-month sentence of probation, that Granderson had violated his conditions of probation by possessing drugs. If Justice Kennedy were correct that the proviso allows a revocation sentence
of probation, one-third as long as the sentence of probation originally imposed, then the District Court could have "punished" Granderson for his
cocaine possession by reducing his period of probation from 60 months to
just over 24 months. Justice Kennedy's interpretation would present
a similar anomaly whenever the drug-possessing probationer has served
less than two-thirds of the sentence of probation initially imposed. Surely
such an interpretation is implausible.

Opinion of the Court
shall revoke the sentence of probation and sentence the de-fendant to not less than one-third of the original sentence."

This language appears to differentiate, not to equate or amal-gamate, "the sentence of probation" and "the original sentence." See United States v. Penn, 17 F. 3d 70, 73 (CA4
1994) ("a sentence of probation does not equate to a sentenceof incarceration"). If Congress wished to convey the meaning pressed by the Government, it could easily have in-structed that the defendant

be incarcerated for a term "not
less than one-third of the original sentence of probation," or"not less than one-third of the revoked term of probation."

The Government's interpretation has a further textual difficulty. The Government reads the word "sentence," when
used as a verb in the proviso's phrase "sentence the defendant," to mean "sentence to imprisonment" rather than "sentence to probation." Yet, when the word "sentence" next
appears, this time as a noun ("original sentence"), the Government reads the word to mean "sentence of probation."
Again, had Congress designed the language to capture the
Government's construction, the proviso might have read:
"[T]he court shall revoke the sentence of probation and sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment whose length
is not less than one-third the length of the original sentence
of probation." Cf. Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U. S. 170,
177 (1993) ("it seems reasonable to give . . . a similar construction" to a word used as both a noun and a verb in a
single statutory sentence).

As the Court of Appeals commented, "[p]robation and imprisonment are not fungible"; they are sentences fundamentally different in character. 969 F. 2d, at 984. One-third of
a 60-month term of probation or "conditional liberty" is a
sentence scarcely resembling a 20-month sentence of imprisonment. The Government insists and, as already noted, we
agree, that the revocation sentence, measured as one-third of
the "original sentence," must be a sentence of imprisonment.
But that "must be" suggests that "original sentence" refers

Opinion of the Court
the resentencer back to an anterior sentence of imprison-ment, not a sentence of probation.

III
Granderson's reading of the $ 3565(a) proviso entails sucha reference back. The words "original sentence," he contends, refer back to $ 3565(a)(2), the prescription immediatelypreceding the drug-possession proviso: the "other sentence
that was available under subchapter A [the general sentenc-ing provisions] at the time of the initial sentencing." The
Guidelines sentence of imprisonment authorized by subchap-ter A was the "original sentence," Granderson argues, for it
was the presumptive sentence, the punishment that proba-tion, as a discretionary alternative, replaced. The Guidelines range of imprisonment available at Granderson's initialsentencing for destruction of mail was 0-6 months. Starting at the top of this range, Granderson arrives at twomonths as the minimum revocation sentence.

A
Granderson's interpretation avoids linguistic anomaliespresented by the Government's construction. First, Granderson's reading differentiates, as does the proviso, between"the sentence of probation" that the resentencer must revoke
and "the original sentence" that determines the duration ofthe revocation sentence. See supra, at 46. Second, Granderson's construction keeps constant the meaning of "sen-tence" in the phrases "sentence the defendant" and "original
sentence." See ibid. While the Government cannot easilyexplain how multiplying a sentence

of probation by one-thirdcan yield a sentence of imprisonment, Granderson's construction encounters no such shoal. See Gordon, 961 F. 2d,at 433 ("one-third of three years probation is one year probation, not one year imprisonment").5

5 The dissent notes that the term "original sentence" has been used in a
number of this Court's opinions and in other statutes and rules, in each
instance to refer to a sentence actually imposed. See post, at 72-73, and

48 UNITED STATES v. GRANDERSON

Opinion of the Court
Granderson's reading of the proviso also avoids the star-tling disparities in sentencing that would attend the Government's interpretation. A 20-month minimum sentencewould exceed not only the 6-month maximum punishment
under the Guidelines for Granderson's original offense; itwould also exceed the 1-year statutory maximum, see 21
U. S. C. $ 844(a), that Granderson could have received, hadthe Government prosecuted him for cocaine possession and
afforded him the full constitutional protections of a criminaltrial, rather than the limited protections of a revocation
hearing.6 Indeed, a 20-month sentence would exceed con-secutive sentences for destruction of mail and cocaine possession (18 months in all).Furthermore, 20 months is only the

minimum revocationsentence, on the Government's reading of the proviso. The

Government's interpretation would have allowed the Dis-trict Court to sentence Granderson to a term of imprisonment equal in length to the revoked term of probation. Thisprison term--five years--would be 10 times the exposure to
imprisonment Granderson faced under the Guidelines for his
nn. 4-5. None of those cases, statutes, or rules, however, involves an
interpretive problem such as the one presented here, where, if the "original sentence" is the sentence actually imposed, a "plain meaning" interpretation of the proviso leads to an absurd result. See supra, at 41, 45, and
n. 4.

The dissent observes, further, that other federal sentencing provisions
"us[e] the word `sentence' to refer to the punishment actually imposed on
a defendant." Post, at 71, n. 2. In each of the cited instances, however,
this reference is made clear by context, either by specifying the type of
sentence (e. g., "sentence to pay a fine," "sentence to probation," 18 U. S. C.

$ 3551(c)), or by using a variant of the phrase "impose sentence" (see

$$ 3553(a), (b), (c), (e); 3554-3558).

6 At a revocation hearing, in contrast to a full-scale criminal trial, the

matter is tried to the court rather than a jury; also, the standard of proof
has been held to be less stringent than the reasonable-doubt standard
applicable to criminal prosecutions. See 18 U. S. C. $ 3565(a); Fed. Rule
Crim. Proc. 32.1; United States v. Gordon, 961 F. 2d 426, 429 (CA3 1992)

original offense, and 5 times the applicable statutory maxi-mum for cocaine possession. It seems unlikely that Congress could have intended so to enlarge the District Court'sdiscretion. See Penn, 17 F. 3d, at 73.

7

B
Two of the Government's arguments against Granderson'sinterpretation are easily answered. First, the Government

observes that the purpose of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act wasto impose tough sanctions on drug abusers. See Brief for
United States 22-26 (listing new penalties and quoting state-ments from Members of Congress that they intended to punish drug offenders severely). But we cannot divine from thelegislators' many "get tough on drug offenders" statements
any reliable guidance to particular provisions. None of thelegislators' expressions, as the Government admits, focuses
on "the precise meaning of the provision at issue in thiscase."

Id., at 24, and n. 4; cf. Busic v. United States, 446U. S. 398, 408 (1980) ("[W]hile Congress had a general desire

to deter firearm abuses, that desire was not unbounded.Our task here is to locate one of the boundaries, and the
inquiry is not advanced by the assertion that Congresswanted no boundaries."). Under Granderson's interpretation, moreover, drug possessors are hardly favored. In7 The dissent suggests that the statutory maximum for the original offense (five years in this case, see 18 U. S. C. $ 1703(a)) is the maximum
revocation sentence. See post, at 77, n. 8. The District Court, however,
could not have imposed this sentence originally, without providing "the
specific reason" for departing from the Guidelines range, 18 U. S. C.

$ 3553(c), and explaining in particular why "an aggravating . . . circumstance [exists,] of a kind, or to a degree, [that was] not adequately taken
into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the
guidelines . . . ." $ 3553(b). Upward departures from the presumptive
Guidelines range to the statutory maximum are thus appropriate only in
exceptional cases. See infra, at 56, n. 14. The dissent's interpretation,
however, would allow district courts to impose the statutory maximum as
a revocation sentence in the routine exercise of their ordinary discretion.

Opinion of the Court
stead, they are singled out among probation violators forparticularly adverse treatment: They face mandatory, rather

than optional, terms of imprisonment.Next, the Government argues that the drug-possession
proviso must be construed in pari materia with the parallelprovision, added at the same time, governing revocation of
supervised release upon a finding of drug possession. In thelatter provision, the Government observes, Congress ordered a revocation sentence of "not less than one-third of theterm of supervised release," and it expressly provided that
the revocation sentence should be "serve[d] in prison." 18U. S. C. $ 3583(g). Correspondingly, the Government maintains, the probation revocation proviso should be construedto require a minimum prison term of one-third the term of
probation. The Government acknowledges that, while Con-gress spelled out "one-third of the term of supervised release," Congress did not similarly say "one-third of the termof probation." However, the Government attributes this
difference to the fact that, unlike probation under the cur-rent sentencing regime, supervised release is not itself an
"original sentence," it is only a component of a sentence that
commences with imprisonment.We are not persuaded that the supervised release revocation prescription should control construction of the probationrevocation proviso. Supervised release, in contrast to probation, is not a punishment in lieu of incarceration. Personsserving postincarceration terms of supervised release generally are more serious offenders than are probationers. But
terms of supervised release, because they follow up prisonterms, are often shorter than initial sentences of probation.

8 A probation term of 1-5 years is available for Class C and D felonies;
the corresponding term of supervised release is not more than 3 years.
For Class E felonies, a 1-5 year probation term is available, but not more
than a 1-year term of supervised release. For misdemeanors, a probation
term of not more than 5 years is available; the corresponding term of

51Cite as: 511 U. S. 39 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
Thus, under the Government's in pari materia approach,drug possessors whose original offense warranted the more

serious sanction of prison plus supervised release wouldoften receive shorter revocation sentences than would drugpossessing probationers.The Government counters that Congress might have intended to punish probationers more severely because theywere "extended special leniency." Reply Brief for United
States 13, n. 14. A sentence of probation, however, even if"lenient," ordinarily reflects the judgment that the offense
and offender's criminal history were not so serious as to war-rant imprisonment. In sum, probation

sans imprisonment
and supervised release following imprisonment are sentencesof unlike character. This fact weighs heavily against the argument that the discrete, differently worded probation andsupervised release revocation provisions should be construed
in pari materia. C

The history of the probation revocation proviso's enact-ment gives us additional cause to resist the Government's
interpretation. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act, in which the pro-viso was included, was a large and complex measure, described by one Member of the House of Representatives as"more like a telephone book than a piece of legislation." 134
Cong. Rec. 33290 (1988) (remarks of Rep. Conte). The proviso seems first to have appeared in roughly its present formas a Senate floor amendment offered after both the House

and the Senate had passed the bill. See id., at 24924-24925(House passage, Sept. 22);

id., at 30826 (Senate passage, Oct.
14); id., at 30945 (proviso included in lengthy set of amend-ments proposed by Sen. Nunn, Oct. 14). No conference report addresses the provision, nor are we aware of any postsupervised release is not more than 1 year. See 18 U. S. C. $$ 3561(b),
3583(b).

Opinion of the Court
conference discussion of the issue.9 The proviso thus seems
to have been inserted into the Anti-Drug Abuse Act without
close inspection. Cf. United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336,
344 (1971) (applying rule of lenity, noting that statutory provision "was a last-minute Senate amendment" to a long and
complex bill and "was hastily passed, with little discussion,
no hearings, and no report").

Another probation-related provision of the Anti-Drug
Abuse Act, proposed shortly before the proviso, casts further
doubt on the Government's reading. That provision amends
the prohibition against using or carrying an explosive in the
commission of a federal felony, to provide in part: "Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court shall not place
on probation or suspend the sentence of any person convicted of a violation of this subsection . . . ." Pub. L. 100-
690, $ 6474(b), 102 Stat. 4380, codified at 18 U. S. C. $ 844(h)
(emphasis added). This provision, notwithstanding its 1988
date of enactment, is intelligible only under pre-1984 law:
The 1984 Sentencing Reform Act had abolished suspended
sentences, and the phrase "place on probation" had yielded
to the phrase "impose a sentence of probation."

Granderson's counsel suggested at oral argument, see Tr.
of Oral Arg. 22-23, 29-31, 36-41, that the proviso's drafters
might similarly have had in mind the pre-1984 sentencing
regime, in particular, the pre-1984 practice of imposing a sentence of imprisonment, suspending its execution, and placing
the defendant on probation. See 18 U. S. C. $ 3651 (1982)
(for any offense "not punishable by death or life imprison9 Debate over the conference bill took place in the middle of the night,

(House vote taken at 1 a.m.), with Congress anxious to adjourn and return
home for the 1988 elections that were little more than two weeks away.
Section-by-section analyses were produced after conference in both the
Senate and the House, but neither publication casts much light on the
proviso. See id., at 32707 (Senate); id., at 33236 (House).

Opinion of the Court
ment," the court may "suspend the imposition or execution
of sentence and place the defendant on probation for such
period and upon such terms and conditions as the court
deems best"). The proviso would fit the suspension-ofexecution scheme precisely: The "original sentence" would
be the sentence imposed but not executed, and one-third of
that determinate sentence would be the revocation sentence.
In that application, the proviso would avoid incongruities
presented in Granderson's and the Government's interpretations of the words "original sentence": An imposed, albeit
unexecuted, term of imprisonment would be an actual, rather
than a merely available, sentence, and one-third of that
sentence would be a term of imprisonment, not probation.
If Granderson could demonstrate that the proviso's drafters in fact drew the prescription to match the pre-1984
suspension-of-execution scheme, Granderson's argument
would be all the more potent: The closest post-1984 analogue
to the suspended sentence is the Guidelines sentence of imprisonment that could have been implemented, but was held
back in favor of a probation sentence.10

We cannot say with assurance that the proviso's drafters
chose the term "original sentence" with a view toward pre1984 law.11 The unexacting process by which the proviso
was enacted, however, and the evident anachronism in another probation-related section of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act,
leave us doubtful that it was Congress' design to punish
drug-possessing probationers with the extraordinarily disproportionate severity the Government urges.

10 See Cunningham, Levi, Green, & Kaplan, Plain Meaning and Hard
Cases, 103 Yale L. J. 1561, 1579-1581 (1994).

11 The chief difficulty with such an interpretation is that pre-1984 law

recognized two kinds of suspended sentences, each of which could lead to
probation. While suspension of the execution of sentence, as mentioned,
neatly fits Granderson's theory, suspension of the imposition of sentence
fits the theory less well: In that situation, no determinate "original sentence" would be at hand for precise calculation of the revocation sentence.

54 UNITED STATES v. GRANDERSON

Opinion of the Court
In these circumstances--where text, structure, and his-tory fail to establish that the Government's position is unambiguously correct--we apply the rule of lenity and resolvethe ambiguity in Granderson's favor. See, e. g., Bass, 404
U. S., at 347-349. We decide that the "original sentence"that sets the duration of the revocation sentence is the applicable Guidelines sentence of imprisonment, not the revokedterm of probation.

IV
We turn, finally, to the Government's argument thatGranderson's theory, and the Court of Appeals' analysis, are

fatally flawed because the Guidelines specify not a term but arange--in this case, 0-6 months. Calculating the minimum
revocation sentence as one-third of that range, the manda-tory minimum term of imprisonment would be 0-2 months,
the Government asserts, which would permit a perverse re-sult: A resentencing court could revoke a drug possessor's
sentence of probation, and then impose no sentence at all.Recognizing this curiosity, lower courts have used not 0-6
months as their starting place, but the top of that range, as

12 Justice Kennedy suggests that our interpretation of the proviso
"read[s] a criminal statute against a criminal defendant," post, at 67, and
that to the extent the rule of lenity is applicable, it would "deman[d] the
interpretation" advanced in his opinion--that the proviso establishes a
mandatory minimum sentence of probation, one-third as long as the sentence of probation initially imposed, post, at 69. We note that Granderson, the criminal defendant in this case, does not urge the interpretation
Justice Kennedy presents. More to the point, both of Justice Kennedy's assertions presuppose that his interpretation of the proviso is a
permissible one. For reasons set out above, we think it is not. See
supra, at 45, and n. 4.

Justice Scalia suggests that on our interpretation of the proviso, the
mandatory minimum revocation sentence should include a fine as well as
a term of imprisonment. See post, at 58. The term of probation, however, was imposed in lieu of a sentence of imprisonment, not in lieu of a
fine. Revocation of the sentence of probation, we think, implies replacing
the sentence of probation with a sentence of imprisonment, but does not
require changing an unrevoked sentence earlier imposed.

the "original sentence," which yields 2 months as the mini-mum revocation sentence. The Government complains that

no court has explained why the top, rather than the middleor the bottom of the range, is the appropriate point of
reference.13The reason for starting at the top of the range, however,
is evident: No other solution yields as sensible a response tothe "original sentence" conundrum. Four measures of the
minimum revocation sentence could be hypothesized as pos-sibilities, if the applicable Guidelines range is the starting
point: The sentence could be calculated as (1) one-third ofthe Guidelines maximum, (2) one-third of the Guidelines minimum, (3) one-third of some point between the minimum andmaximum, such as the midpoint, or (4) one-third of the range
itself. The latter two possibilities can be quickly eliminated.Selecting a point between minimum and maximum, whether
the midpoint or some other point, would be purely arbitrary.Calculating the minimum revocation sentence as one-third of
the Guidelines range, in practical application, yields the sameresult as setting the minimum revocation sentence at onethird of the Guidelines minimum: To say, for example, that a
2-4 month sentence is the minimum revocation sentence iseffectively to say that a 2-month sentence is the minimum.

Using the Guidelines minimum in cases such as the pres-ent one (0-6 month range), as already noted, would yield a

The Court of Appeals in the present case was not required to identify the
minimum term, because Granderson had served five months more than the
top of the Guidelines range by the time the opinion was issued. See 969

minimum revocation sentence of zero, a result incompatible
with the apparent objective of the proviso--to assure that
those whose probation is revoked for drug possession serve
a term of imprisonment. The maximum Guidelines sentence
as the benchmark for the revocation sentence, on the other

V
We decide, in sum, that the drug-possession proviso of

$ 3565(a) establishes a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment, but we reject the Government's contention that
the proviso unambiguously calls for a sentence based on the
term of probation rather than the originally applicable
Guidelines range of imprisonment. Granderson's interpretation, if not flawless, is a securely plausible reading of the
statutory language, and it avoids the textual difficulties and
sentencing disparities we identified in the Government's position. In these circumstances, in common with the Court
of Appeals, we apply the rule of lenity and resolve the ambiguity in Granderson's favor. The minimum revocation sentence, we hold, is one-third the maximum of the originally

14 The Government observes that "in appropriate circumstances" the
sentencing court may depart upward from the presumptive Guidelines
range, limited in principle only by the statutory maximum. See 18
U. S. C. $ 3553(b). According to the Government, it follows that if the
"original sentence" is the "maximum available sentence," then the statutory maximum rather than the top of the presumptive Guidelines range is
the appropriate basis for the revocation sentence. Brief for United States
22. The short answer to the Government's argument is that for cases in
which the sentencing judge considers an upward departure warranted, a
sentence of probation, rather than one of imprisonment, is a most unlikely
prospect. It makes scant sense, then, to assume that an "original sentence" for purposes of probation revocation is a sentence beyond the presumptively applicable Guidelines range.

applicable Guidelines range,15 and the maximum revocationsentence is the Guidelines maximum.

In this case, the maximum revocation sentence is sixmonths. Because Granderson had served 11 months imprisonment by the time the Court of Appeals issued its decision,that court correctly ordered his release. The judgment of
the Court of Appeals is therefore

Affirmed.

Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment.
My view of this case is close to, but not precisely, that of
Justice Kennedy. I agree with him, for the reasons hewell expresses, that the only linguistically tenable interpretation of 18 U. S. C. $ 3565(a) establishes as a floor a sentenceone-third of the sentence originally imposed, but leaves the
district court free to impose any greater sentence availablefor the offense under the United States Code and the
Sentencing Guidelines. Wherein I differ is that I do not be-lieve (as he does) that only the probation element of the original sentence is to be considered--i. e., as he puts it, "that`original sentence' refers to the sentence of probation a
defendant in fact received at the initial sentencing." Post,at 61 (emphasis added). (

The Chief Justice also espouses

15 At oral argument the Government suggested that its own interpretation is more lenient than Granderson's, in those rare cases in which the
court has departed downward from the Guidelines to impose a sentence of
probation. In United States v. Harrison, 815 F. Supp. 494 (DC 1993), for
example, the court, on the Government's motion, had departed downward
from a 97-121 month Guidelines range and a 10-year statutory mandatory
minimum to impose only a sentence of probation. When the Government
moved to revoke probation for drug possession, the court held that the
statute required basing the revocation sentence upon the term of probation rather than the Guidelines range, and, in the alternative, that even if
the statute were ambiguous, the rule of lenity would so require. Having
found $ 3565(a)'s drug-possession proviso ambiguous, we agree that the
rule of lenity would support a shorter sentence, whether on Harrison's
analysis, or on the theory that the "applicable Guidelines range" is the
maximum of a Guidelines range permitting a sentence of probation.

this view, see post, at 71.) It seems to me that the term
must refer to the entire original sentence; where that includes a fine in addition to the probation, the fine also is
included. Thus, one-third of a sentence consisting of three
years' probation and a $3,000 fine would be not merely one
year's probation but a $1,000 fine as well. Even the majority, to maintain some measure of consistency in its strained
interpretation of "original sentence," ought to consider, in
addition to "the applicable Guidelines sentence of imprisonment," ante, at 54, the equally applicable range of fines set
forth in the Guidelines, see United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 5E1.2(c)(3) (Nov. 1993) (USSG).*

*The Court's reply to this is that since "[t]he term of probation . . . was
imposed in lieu of a sentence of imprisonment, not in lieu of a fine," its
revocation "implies replacing the sentence of probation with a sentence of
imprisonment." Ante, at 54, n. 12. I do not know why an implication
would inhere in the proviso which contradicts the body of $ 3565(a)(2) to
which the proviso is attached. The latter provides that the court may
"revoke the sentence of probation and impose any other sentence that
was available . . . at the time of the initial sentencing" (emphasis added).
Presumably the Court would concede that "any other sentence" includes
a fine--in which case its discernment of some implication that revoked
probation may be replaced by only prison time must be wrong.

Justice Kennedy makes a similar defense. He refuses to consider the
fine component because "[t]he proviso instructs the district court to `revoke the sentence of probation,' but says nothing about the fine imposed
at the initial sentencing," post, at 61. There is, however, clearly no requirement that only what has been revoked can be the baseline for measuring the requisite minimum--for even the unrevoked (because already
served) portion of the probation period counts. Justice Kennedy's argument reduces, therefore, to the contention that for some unexplained
reason the requisite minimum replacement for the revoked "probation
component" of the original sentence can be measured only by that same
component. This imperative is not to be found in the language of the
statute; to the contrary, interchangeability of fines and probation is suggested by the body of $ 3565(a)(2) quoted above. Here, it seems to me,
Justice Kennedy simply abandons the text and adopts an intuited limitation remarkably similar to those for which he criticizes the Court and
the dissent.

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
Both under my analysis, and under Justice Kennedy's,there exists a problem of comparing the incomparable that

ought to be acknowledged. Since Granderson's original sen-tence was 60 months' probation

plus a $2,000 fine, I must, in
order to concur in today's judgment, conclude, as I do, that
the five extra months of prison (beyond the Guidelines' 6-month maximum imposable for the original offense) which

Granderson has served are worth at least $667 (one-third theoriginal fine) and that 11 months in prison are the equivalent
of 20 months' probation plus a $667 fine--because otherwiseI would have to consider imposing some or all of the $5,000
maximum fine imposable for the original offense, see USSG

$ 5E1.2(c)(3), or indeed consider departing upward from the
applicable Guidelines range, see 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(b), towards
the 5-year imprisonment that is the statutory maximum for
the offense, see 18 U. S. C. $ 1703(a). And Justice Kennedy, even if he takes only the probation into account for
purposes of determining the "original sentence," must still
conclude, it seems to me, that 11 months in prison is at least
the equivalent of 20 months' probation--because otherwise
he would have to consider imposing some or all of the available $5,000 fine or departing upward from the Guidelines.

It is no easy task to determine how many days' imprisonment equals how many dollars' fine equals how many months'
probation. Comparing the incommensurate is always a
tricky business. See, e. g., Bendix Autolite Corp. v. Midwesco Enterprises, Inc., 486 U. S. 888, 897 (1988) (Scalia, J.,
concurring in judgment). I frankly doubt that those who
drafted and adopted this language intended to impose that
task upon us; but I can neither pronounce the results reached
by a straightforward reading of the statute utterly absurd
nor discern any other self-evident disposition for which they
are an obviously mistaken replacement. Cf. Green v. Bock
Laundry Machine Co., 490 U. S. 504, 527 (1989) (Scalia, J.,

double curse of producing neither textually faithful resultsnor plausibly intended ones. It is best, as usual, to apply

the statute as written, and to let Congress make the neededrepairs. That repairs are needed is perhaps the only thing
about this wretchedly drafted statute that we can all agreeupon.

For these reasons, I concur in the judgment of the Court.
Justice Kennedy, concurring in the judgment.
The Court's holding that the drug proviso in 18 U. S. C.$ 3565(a) calls for a mandatory minimum sentence of two

months in prison rests upon two premises: first, that theterm "original sentence" means the maximum Guidelines
sentence that the district court could have, but did not, im-pose at the initial sentencing; and, second, that the verb "sentence" means only "sentence to imprisonment." Neitherpremise is correct. As close analysis of the text and structure of the statute demonstrates, the proviso requires a man-datory minimum sentence of a probation term one-third the
length of the initial term of probation. I concur in the judg-ment only because Granderson, under my reading of the statute, was entitled to release from prison.

I
Section 3565(a) provides, in relevant part:

"If the defendant violates a condition of probation at anytime prior to the expiration or termination of the term

of probation, the court may . . ."(1) continue him on probation, with or without extending the term or modifying or enlarging the condi-tions; or

"(2) revoke the sentence of probation and impose anyother sentence that was available under subchapter A at
the time of the initial sentencing."Notwithstanding any other provision of this section,
if a defendant is found by the court to be in possession

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
of a controlled substance, thereby violating the conditionimposed by section 3563(a)(3), the court shall revoke the

sentence of probation and sentence the defendant to notless than one-third of the original sentence." (Emphasis added.)
The Court construes the term "original sentence" to referto the maximum sentence of imprisonment available under

the Guidelines at the initial sentencing. I accept, in sub-stantial part,

The Chief Justice's critique of the Court'sstrained interpretation, and agree with him that "original

sentence" refers to the sentence of probation a defendant infact received at the initial sentencing. It is true that the
term "original sentence," standing alone, could be read toencompass the entire original sentence, including any fine
imposed. When considered in context, however, it is prefer-able to construe the term to refer only to the original sentence of probation. The proviso instructs the district courtto "revoke the sentence of probation," but says nothing about
the fine imposed at the initial sentencing. Given this, thesubsequent reference to "one-third of the original sentence"
is better read to mean the probation component of the origi-nal sentence, and not the whole sentence.

I disagree with both the Court and The Chief Justice,however, in their conclusion that the verb "sentence" in the
proviso means only "sentence to imprisonment." Given thestatutory text and structure, the verb "sentence" can mean
either "sentence to probation" or "sentence to imprison-ment." It follows, in my view, that the drug proviso calls
for a mandatory minimum sentence equal to a probationterm one-third the length of the original term of probation.

Before 1984, fines and imprisonment were the only sen-tences in the federal system; probation, by contrast, was an
alternative to sentencing. See 18 U. S. C. $ 3651 (1982). Inthe Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Congress altered this
understanding and made probation a kind of sentence. See$ 3561(a) (defendant "may be sentenced to a term of proba511us1$31L 11-03-97 17:00:28 PAGES OPINPGT

tion"); United States Sentencing Commission, GuidelinesManual ch. 7, pt. A2(a), p. 321 (Nov. 1993) (USSG) ("[T]he

Sentencing Reform Act recognized probation as a sentencein itself "). Probation no longer entails some deviation from
a presumptive sentence of imprisonment, as the facts of this
case illustrate. Granderson's conviction for destruction ofmail, when considered in light of his criminal history category, placed him in Zone A of the Guidelines SentencingTable, which carries a presumptive sentence of 0 to 6 months.
The Sentencing Guidelines authorize a sentence of probationfor defendants falling within Zone A, see USSG $ 5B1.1(a)(1),
and set a maximum probation term of five years for the subset of Zone A defendants of which Granderson is a member,
see $ 5B1.2(a)(1). For defendants like Granderson, then,
probation is a sentence available at the initial sentencing,
no less so than a sentence of imprisonment. See 18 U. S. C.

$ 3553(a)(4) (the court, in determining sentence, "shall consider . . . the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range
established for the applicable category of offense . . . as set
forth in the guidelines") (emphasis added). Because the
term "to sentence," if left unadorned, can bear any one of
three meanings, Congress took care, as a general matter, to
specify the type of punishment called for when it used "sentence" as a verb in Chapter 227 of Title 18, the sentencing
provisions of the criminal code. See, e. g., $ 3561(a) ("sentenced to a term of probation"), $ 3572(e) ("sentenced to
pay a fine"), $ 3583(a) ("impos[e] a sentence to a term of
imprisonment").

Congress was less careful when drafting the provision now
before us, which does not specify whether the district court
should impose a fine, imprisonment, or another term of probation when revoking the original term of probation on account of drug possession. The Government brushes aside
this significant ambiguity, contending that "the language of
the statute, in context," demonstrates that Congress "plainly
intended" to require imprisonment. Brief for United States

14, 15. The Government is correct to say that we must ex-amine the context of the proviso to ascertain its meaning.

See Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803, 809(1989). Close attention to that context, however, leads me
to conclude that Congress did not intend to require imprisonment upon revocation of the original term of probation.Congress enacted the drug proviso as $ 7303(a)(2) of the

Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (1988 Act). Pub. L. 100-690,102 Stat. 4181, 4464. Section 7303(b)(2) of the 1988 Act,
which concerns defendants serving a term of supervised re-lease, provides that "[i]f the defendant is found by the court
to be in the possession of a controlled substance, the court
shall terminate the term of supervised release and require
the defendant to serve in prison not less than one-third of
the term of supervised release." 102 Stat. 4464, codified at
18 U. S. C. $ 3583(g) (emphasis added).

Sections 7303(a)(2) and (b)(2) are, as the Government puts
it, "parallel and closely related." Brief for United States 26.
Both pertain to the consequences of drug possession for
defendants under some form of noncustodial supervision.
They differ, of course, in one fundamental respect: Section
7303(b)(2) explicitly provides for a revocation sentence of
imprisonment, while $ 7303(a)(2) does not. The difference
is significant. " `[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress
acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or
exclusion.' " Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U. S. 395,
404 (1991), quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16,
23 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). The presumption loses some of its force when the sections in question are
dissimilar and scattered at distant points of a lengthy and
complex enactment. But in this case, given the parallel
structure of $$ 7303(a)(2) and (b)(2) and the fact that Congress enacted both provisions in the same section of the same
Act, the presumption is strong. The disparate use of the

511us1$31L 11-03-97 17:00:28 PAGES OPINPGT
64 UNITED STATES v. GRANDERSON

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
term "to serve in prison" is compelling evidence that Congress intended to mandate incarceration as a revocation punishment in $ 7303(b)(2), but not in $ 7303(a)(2) (the $ 3565(a)
drug proviso).

The Government interposes a structural argument of its
own. Before enactment of the drug proviso in the 1988 Act,

$ 3565(a) consisted only of subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2), which,
for all relevant purposes, took the same form as they do now.
Those provisions grant courts two options for defendants
who violate probation conditions that do not involve drugs
or guns. Section 3565(a)(1) permits a court to continue the
defendant on probation, with or without extending the term
or modifying or enlarging the conditions. As an alternative,

$ 3565(a)(2) permits a court to "revoke the sentence of probation and impose any other sentence that was available . . . at
the time of the initial sentencing." According to the Government, the two provisions make clear that the consequence
of revocation under $ 3565(a)(2) is that, in light of $ 3565(a)(1),
the court must impose a sentence other than probation,
namely imprisonment. The meaning borne by the phrase
"revoke the sentence of probation" in $ 3565(a)(2), the Government concludes, must carry over when the same phrase
appears in the drug proviso.

This argument, which the Court accepts, see ante, at 45,
is not convincing. The conclusion that $ 3565(a)(2) demands
imprisonment upon revocation of the original sentence of
probation does not rest upon anything inherent in the phrase
"revoke the sentence of probation." Rather, it follows from
the structure of $$ 3565(a)(1) and (a)(2). Congress set off
subsection (a)(2) as an alternative to subsection (a)(1), which
provides for every conceivable probation option. Thus, in
order to make sense of the statutory scheme, $ 3565(a)(2)
should be read to require a punishment of something other
than probation: imprisonment. That consequence, however,
is due to the juxtaposition of subsection (a)(2) with subsec511us1$31L 11-03-97 17:00:28 PAGES OPINPGT

65Cite as: 511 U. S. 39 (1994)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
tion (a)(1), not to Congress' use of the phrase "revoke the
sentence of probation" in $ 3565(a)(2). Taken by itself, that
phrase requires termination of the original sentence of probation, but does not indicate the kind of sentence that must
be imposed in its place. The meaning assumed by the
phrase "revoke the sentence of probation" in the particular
context of $ 3565(a)(2), then, does not travel when the same
phrase appears in a different context.

The Government's argument that "revoke the sentence of
probation," standing alone, must import a sentence of imprisonment also fails to account for how similar language is
used in $ 7303(b)(2) of the 1988 Act. That provision, as noted
above, states that "the court shall terminate the term of
supervised release and require the defendant to serve in
prison not less than one-third of the term of supervised release" if a defendant is found in possession of drugs. 18
U. S. C. $ 3583(g) (emphasis added). The statutory text suggests that a subsequent sentence of imprisonment is not implicit in the phrase "the court shall terminate the term of
supervised release"; had it been, Congress would not have
felt it necessary to mandate imprisonment in an explicit manner. So there is little reason to think that Congress believed
imprisonment to be implicit in the parallel phrase "the court
shall revoke the sentence of probation" in the $ 3565(a) drug
proviso, $ 7303(a)(2) of the 1988 Act.

The Government's view suffers from a final infirmity. The
term "original sentence" refers to the sentence of probation
imposed at the initial sentencing. So if the proviso imposed
a minimum punishment of incarceration, the length of incarceration must be tied to the length of the revoked sentence
of probation. That would be an odd result. " `[I]mprisonment is an `intrinsically different' form of punishment' " than
probation. Blanton v. North Las Vegas, 489 U. S. 538, 542
(1989), quoting Muniz v. Hoffman, 422 U. S. 454, 477 (1975).
Without belaboring the point, probation is a form of "condi511us1$31L 11-03-97 17:00:28 PAGES OPINPGT

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
tional liberty," Black v. Romano, 471 U. S. 606, 611 (1985),
while imprisonment is nothing of the sort. Transforming a
sentence of probation into a prison term via some mathematical formula would, in the words of one court to have considered this issue, constitute a form of "legal alchemy." United
States v. Gordon, 961 F. 2d 426, 433 (CA3 1992). In all
events, it is not what one would expect in the ordinary
course.

The Chief Justice is correct, of course, to say that it
would not be irrational for Congress to tie a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment to the length of the original
probation term. Post, at 75. He is also correct to observe
that Congress would have been within its powers to write
such a result into law, and that Congress indeed provided for
a similar result in $ 7303(b)(2) of the 1988 Act, 18 U. S. C.

$ 3583(g). Post, at 76. But these observations do not speak
to the only relevant question: whether Congress did so in
the text of the $ 3565(a) drug proviso, viewed in light of the
statutory structure. For all of the above reasons, in my
view it did not.

In sum, the drug proviso does not mandate incarceration,
but rather must be read to permit a revocation sentence of
probation. Concluding that the mandatory minimum sentence is a term of imprisonment would be inconsistent with
this reading, and would also lead to the anomaly of tying the
length of the mandated prison term to the original term of
probation. It follows that the mandatory minimum sentence
required by the drug proviso is a probation term equal to
one-third the length of the original term of probation.
Given that Congress did not eliminate the possibility of incarceration (for example, by drafting the proviso to require
a "sentence of probation"), the proviso gives the district
court the discretion to impose any prison term otherwise
available under the other portions of $ 3565(a), which is more

II
It is unfortunate that Congress has drafted a criminal stat-ute that is far from transparent; more unfortunate that the

Court has interpreted it to require imprisonment when thetext and structure call for a different result; but most unfortunate that the Court has chosen such a questionable path toreach its destination. I speak of the Court's speculation that
Congress drafted the $ 3565(a) drug proviso with the pre-1984 federal sentencing regime in mind. See

ante, at 52-53.Reading the proviso to require Granderson to serve a 2-

month mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment, theCourt reasons, "would fit the [pre-1984] scheme precisely."
Ante, at 53. And viewing the proviso in that light, theCourt adds, would avoid problems with both Granderson's
and the Government's interpretations. See ibid. Althoughthe Court purports not to place much reliance upon this venture in interpretive archaeology, its extended discussion ofthe matter suggests otherwise.

This interpretive technique, were it to take hold, would bequite a novel addition to the traditional rules that govern
our interpretation of criminal statutes. Some Members ofthe Court believe that courts may look to "the language and
structure, legislative history, and motivating policies" whenreading a criminal statute in a manner adverse to a criminal
defendant. See United States v. R. L. C., 503 U. S. 291, 305(1992) (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Others would eschew reliance upon legislative history andnebulous motivating policies when construing criminal statutes. See id., at 308-310 (Scalia, J., concurring). But, tomy knowledge, none of us has ever relied upon some vague
intuition of what Congress "might . . . have had in mind"(ante, at 52) when drafting a criminal law. And I am certain
that we have not read a criminal statute against a criminaldefendant by attributing to Congress a mindset that reflects
a statutory framework that Congress itself had discardedover four years earlier.

68 UNITED STATES v. GRANDERSON

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
Of course, the Court thinks it has done Granderson andprobationers like him a great favor with its guesswork: Assuming that the drug proviso mandates incarceration, theCourt's intuitions lead it to conclude that the mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment here is 2, rather than 20,
months. But in its rush to achieve what it views as justicein this case, the Court has missed a broader point: The statute, by word and design, does not mandate a punishment ofimprisonment on revocation. In my respectful submission,
had the Court adhered to the text and structure of the stat-ute Congress enacted and the President signed, rather than
given effect to its own intuitions of what might have been on
Congress' mind at the time, it would have come to a different
conclusion. See Deal v. United States, 508 U. S. 129, 136-
137 (1993). And the fortuity that Granderson himself does
not contend that the proviso permits a revocation sentence
of probation, see ante, at 54, n. 12, is no reason to overlook
that option here, given that our interpretation of the statute
binds all probationers, not just Granderson. Cf. Elder v.
Holloway, 510 U. S. 510, 514-516, and n. 3 (1994).

Perhaps the result the Court reaches today may be sensible as a matter of policy, and may even reflect what some in
Congress hoped to accomplish. That result, however, does
not accord with the text of the statute Congress saw fit to
enact. Put in simple terms, if indeed Congress intended to
require the mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment
the Court surmises, Congress fired a blank. See Puerto
Rico Dept. of Consumer Affairs v. ISLA Petroleum Corp.,
485 U. S. 495, 501 (1988) ("[U]nenacted approvals, beliefs,
and desires are not laws"). It is beyond our province to rescue Congress from its drafting errors, and to provide for
what we might think, perhaps along with some Members
of Congress, is the preferred result. See Smith v. United
States, 508 U. S. 223, 247, n. 4 (1993) (Scalia, J., dissenting)

Group, Div. of Cadence Industries Corp., 493 U. S. 120, 126
(1989) ("Our task is to apply the text, not to improve upon
it"); United States v. Locke, 471 U. S. 84, 95 (1985) ("[T]he
fact that Congress might have acted with greater clarity or
foresight does not give courts a carte blanche to redraft statutes in an effort to achieve that which Congress is perceived
to have failed to do"). This admonition takes on a particular
importance when the Court construes criminal laws. "[B]ecause of the seriousness of criminal penalties, and because
criminal punishment usually represents the moral condemnation of the community, legislatures and not courts should define criminal activity," United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336,
348 (1971), and set the punishments therefor, see Bifulco v.
United States, 447 U. S. 381 (1980).

Under any of the three interpretations set forth in the
opinions filed today, there are bound to be cases where the
mandatory sentence will make little sense or appear anomalous when compared with sentences imposed in similar cases.
Some incongruities, however, are inherent in any statute
providing for mandatory minimum sentences.

In my view, it is not necessary to invoke the rule of lenity
here, for the text and structure of the statute yield but one
proper answer. But assuming, as the Court does, that the
rule comes into play, I would have thought that it demands
the interpretation set forth above. For these reasons, I concur only in the judgment.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Thomas
joins, dissenting.

The Court today interprets the term "original sentence,"
as it appears in 18 U. S. C. $ 3565(a), to mean "the maximum
sentence, under the relevant Sentencing Guidelines range,
which a defendant could have received, but did not, when
initially sentenced." I think this interpretation ignores the

most natural meaning of these two words, and I therefore
dissent.

Section 3565(a) does not indicate on its face whether a defendant found in violation of probation must be sentenced to
prison or resentenced to another term of probation. I agree
with the Court that $ 3565(a) must be read to require imposition of a term of imprisonment; otherwise, as the Court explains, the proviso would be senseless.1 See ante, at 45; In
re Chapman, 166 U. S. 661, 667 (1897) ("[N]othing is better
settled than that statutes should receive a sensible construction, such as will effectuate the legislative intention, and, if
possible, so as to avoid an unjust or an absurd conclusion").
If the Court had stopped there, I would have been happy to
join its opinion. Having correctly resolved one ambiguity in

$ 3565(a), however, the Court proceeds to find another, regarding the meaning of the term "original sentence," where
none exists. The Court thus ultimately concludes, incorrectly in my view, that the rule of lenity should be applied.

The Court believes that the Government's reading of

$ 3565(a) is not "unambiguously correct." Ante, at 54. As
we have explained, however, the rule of lenity should not be
applied "merely because it [is] possible to articulate a construction more narrow than that urged by the Government."
Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 108 (1990). Instead
we have reserved lenity for those situations where, after
"[a]pplying well-established principles of statutory construction," Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 410
(1991), there still remains "a grievous ambiguity or uncer1 The option of imposing a fine after revocation is also foreclosed. As a
matter of common usage, the prepositional phrase following a noun need
not be repeated when the noun appears again in the same sentence.
Thus, $ 3565(a) reads: "[T]he court shall revoke the sentence of probation
and sentence the defendant to not less than one-third of the original sentence [of probation]." (Emphasis added.) "[N]ot less than one-third" of
a term of probation is a period of time. A fine cannot follow revocation,
then, because a fine is measured in money, not time.

tainty in the language and structure of the Act," Chapmanv. United States, 500 U. S. 453, 463 (1991) (internal quotation

marks and citation omitted).The term "original sentence" is not defined in the statute.
A basic principle of statutory construction provides thatwhere words in a statute are not defined, they "must be
given their ordinary meaning." Id., at 462; see also Smithv.

United States, 508 U. S. 223, 228 (1993) ("When a word isnot defined by statute, we normally construe it in accord

with its ordinary or natural meaning").Whether one consults a dictionary or common sense, the
meaning of "original sentence" is plain: The term refers tothe initial judgment imposing punishment on a defendant.
"Original" is commonly understood to mean "initial" or "firstin order." See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1592 (1971) (Webster's) (defining "original" as "of or re-lating to a rise or beginning . . . initial, primary"); Black's
Law Dictionary 1099 (6th ed. 1990) (defining "original" as"[p]rimitive" or "first in order"). "Sentence," in turn, is ordinarily meant in the context of criminal law to refer to thejudgment or order "by which a court or judge imposes punishment or penalty upon a person found guilty." Webster's2068; see also Black's Law Dictionary, supra, at 1362 (defining "sentence" as "[t]he judgment . . . imposing the punish-ment to be inflicted, usually in the form of a fine, incarceration, or probation").2 In the context of $ 3565(a), the term"original sentence" thus must refer to the sentence of probation a defendant actually received when initially sentenced.It cannot, therefore, mean what the Court says it means: the
maximum sentence which a defendant could have received,but did not.

The Court's interpretation thus founders, I believe, be-cause the word "sentence" does not ordinarily, or even occa2 Federal sentencing law also consistently uses the word "sentence" to
refer to the punishment actually imposed on a defendant. See, e. g., 18
U. S. C. $$ 3551(b) and (c), 3553(a), (b), (c), and (e), and 3554-3558.

sionally, refer to a range of available punishment. Nor does
the modifying word "original" support the Court's interpretation, because "original" is nowhere defined as "potential"
or "available," nor can it be so construed. Yet under the
Court's interpretation of the term "original sentence," if we
know that "sentence" itself does not mean an available range
of punishment, then "original" must be twisted to mean what
we know it cannot--i. e., "potential" or "available." 3

This Court has on many occasions demonstrated its clear
understanding of the term "original sentence." See, e. g.,
Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U. S. 624, 639, and n. 11 (1988) (using
term "original sentence" to refer to sentence of imprisonment initially imposed and suspended); Tuten v. United
States, 460 U. S. 660, 666-667, and n. 11 (1983) (using term
"original sentence" to refer to period of probation imposed
by sentencing court when youthful defendant was initially
sentenced); United States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U. S. 117, 135
(1980), and id., at 148 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (both using
term "original sentence" to refer to sentence imposed upon
defendant at conclusion of first trial); North Carolina v.
Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 713, and n. 1 (1969), and id., at 743
(Black, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (same);
Pennsylvania ex rel. Sullivan v. Ashe, 302 U. S. 51, 53 (1937)

3 Congress itself, in the subsections preceding and following the provision at issue here, distinguishes between "original" and "available." Sections 3565(a)(2) and (b) provide that under certain circumstances, a court
can or must "revoke the sentence of probation and impose any other sentence that was available . . . at the time of the initial sentencing." (Emphasis added.) If "original" and "available" were in fact synonymous, or
if "sentence" could mean an available range of punishment, Congress could
have simply stated in $$ 3565(a)(2) and (b) that upon revocation of probation, a court can or must "impose the original sentence." See United
States v. Sosa, 997 F. 2d 1130, 1133 (CA5 1993) ("The statute taken as a
whole demonstrates that Congress knew how to refer to the sentence the
defendant could have received at the time of the initial sentencing. Instead, . . . Congress used the term `original sentence,' which plainly refers
to the sentence imposed on the defendant for his original crime").

(same). As these and numerous other opinions show,4 wehave until today invariably used "original sentence" just as

one would expect: to refer to the punishment imposed upona defendant when he was first sentenced, and to distinguish
that initial sentence from a sentence the defendant received
after some intervening event--such as a new trial, see
Pearce, supra, or a revocation of probation, see Hicks,
supra.5The Court's heretofore firm grasp on the meaning of "original sentence" should not be cause for wonder or surprise.Whether alone or in combination, the definitions of "original"
and "sentence" simply do not seem open to serious debate.Once the term "original sentence" is accorded its ordinary
meaning, the operation of $ 3565(a) becomes perfectly clear.6

4 The term "original sentence" appears in at least 50 prior opinions.
Rather than citing them all, suffice it to say that a review of these opinions
reveals that the term is not once used to refer to the range of punishment
potentially applicable when a defendant was first sentenced.

5 Although the term "original sentence" does not appear in other provisions of the Federal Criminal Code chapter on sentencing, it does appear
in other federal statutes and rules. In each instance, the term refers to
the sentence initially imposed upon a defendant. See, e. g., Fed. Rule
Crim. Proc. 35(a)(2) (directing sentencing courts to correct sentences upon
remand from a court of appeals if, after further sentencing proceedings,
"the court determines that the original sentence was incorrect"); 10
U. S. C. $ 863 (providing that upon rehearing in a court-martial, "no sentence in excess of or more severe than the original sentence may be imposed"). The term is similarly used in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.
See, e. g., United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual

$ 4A1.2(k) (Nov. 1993) (using term "original sentence" to refer to sentence
previously imposed upon defendant); $ 7B1.4, comment., n. 4 (same).

6 The Court suggests that if "original sentence" is given its ordinary

meaning, the statute will have to be interpreted to require the absurd
result that a revocation sentence be another term of probation. See ante,
at 47-48, n. 5. I do not see at all how or why the latter proposition follows
from the former. The Court rightly rejects interpreting the statute to
require reimposition of probation because that would be a senseless reading, and it would be senseless regardless of what the term "original sentence" means. See ante, at 44-45. It is thus beyond me why the Court

511us1$31H 11-03-97 17:00:28 PAGES OPINPGT
74 UNITED STATES v. GRANDERSON

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
It follows, from another elementary canon of construction,that the plain language of $ 3565(a) should control. See

Moskal, 498 U. S., at 108. As we stated in Consumer Prod-uct Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U. S. 102, 108
(1980), "[a]bsent a clearly expressed legislative intention tothe contrary, [the statutory] language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive." 7The Court offers several reasons for rejecting the most
natural reading of $ 3565(a). None of them persuades. TheCourt begins by suggesting that if Congress meant for the
sentence of probation to be used to calculate the length ofincarceration, it could have stated so more clearly. See
ante, at 46. Although perhaps true, Congress could havejust as easily, if it wished, stated in clear terms that the
sentence of incarceration should be calculated based on themaximum available sentence under the Guidelines range.
Indeed, as I have already noted, supra, at 72, n. 3, Congressstated something very similar in the subsections preceding
and following the one at issue, where it provided that uponrevocation of probation, a court can or must impose any sentence that was "available" when the defendant was initiallysentenced. See $$ 3565(a)(2) and (b);

United States v. Sosa,
997 F. 2d 1130, 1133 (CA5 1993); United States v. Byrkett,
961 F. 2d 1399, 1400-1401 (CA8 1992) ("If Congress, in refer-ring to the `original sentence,' meant the Guidelines range

seems to think that according the term "original sentence" its most natural reading would require it to readopt a reading of the statute that it
justifiably discarded as senseless.

7 The Court suggests that the legislative history of $ 3565(a) casts doubt

upon the Government's interpretation. Yet even the Court recognizes
that the legislative history is, at best, inconclusive. See ante, at 49
("None of the legislators' expressions . . . focuses on `the precise meaning
of the provision at issue in this case' ") (quoting Brief for United States
24, and n. 4); see also ante, at 51-53, and n. 11. Where the language of a
statute is clear, that language, rather than "isolated excerpts from the
legislative history," should be followed. Patterson v. Shumate, 504 U. S.
753, 761, and n. 4 (1992).

applicable at the time of the initial sentencing, it would havesimply said, `any other sentence that was available . . . at

the time of the initial sentencing,' as it did" in $$ 3565(a)(2)and (b)).

The Court also asserts that its reading of the term avoids
according two different meanings to the word "sentence."Yet under the Court's own interpretation, the word "sentence" when used as a verb refers to the imposition of a fixedperiod of incarceration; but when the word "sentence" next
appears, as a noun, the Court concludes that it refers to arange of available punishment. Thus it is the Court's reading of the statute that fails " `to give . . . a similar construction' " to a word used as both a noun and a verb in a
single statutory sentence. See ante, at 46 (quoting Reves v.
Ernst & Young, 507 U. S. 170, 177 (1993)). Under what I
think is the correct reading of the statute, all that changes
is what the defendant will be (or was) sentenced to--prison
or probation; the word "sentence" itself does not change
meanings.

The Court next contends that " `[p]robation and imprisonment are not fungible,' " ante, at 46 (citation omitted), and
that its interpretation of the statute avoids the "shoal" supposedly encountered when explaining "how multiplying a
sentence of probation by one-third can yield a sentence of
imprisonment," ante, at 47. Probation and imprisonment,
however, need not be fungible for this statute to make sense.
They need only both be subsumed under the term "sentence," which, for the reasons previously stated, they are.
See Black's Law Dictionary, at 1362 (defining "sentence" as
a judgment imposing punishment, which may include "a fine,
incarceration, or probation"). While tying the length of imprisonment to the length of the original sentence of probation might seem harsh to the Court, surely it is not an irrational method of calculation. Indeed, the Court does not
question that Congress could have tied the length of imprisonment to the length of the original sentence of probation.

76 UNITED STATES v. GRANDERSON

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
Congress in fact prescribed a similar method of calculation
in a parallel provision of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988,
18 U. S. C. $ 3583(g), which was added at the same time as

$ 3565(a) and which also sets out the punishment for defendants found in possession of a controlled substance. Section
3583(g) explicitly provides: "If the defendant is found by
the court to be in the possession of a controlled substance,
the court shall terminate the term of supervised release and
require the defendant to serve in prison not less than onethird of the term of supervised release." Considering that

$$ 3565(a) and 3583(g) were enacted at the same time and
are directed at precisely the same problem, it seems quite
reasonable to construe them in pari materia to call for parallel treatment of drug offenders under noncustodial supervision. Whatever the differences between supervised release
and probation, surely supervised release is more like probation than it is like imprisonment. That Congress explicitly
chose in $ 3583(g) to tie the length of imprisonment to the
length of supervised release suggests quite strongly that
Congress meant in $ 3565(a) to use length of the original sentence of probation as the basis for calculation. At the very
least, the method of calculation prescribed in $ 3583(g) removes the imaginary "shoal" which blocks the Court's way
to a sensible construction of $ 3565(a).

The Court refuses to read these provisions in pari materia because a sentence of probation is normally--but not necessarily--longer than a period of supervised release. See
ante, at 50-51, and n. 8. Simply because the end result of
the calculation might be different in some cases, however, is
not a persuasive reason for refusing to recognize the obvious
similarity in the methods of calculation. Nor is it irrational
for Congress to have decided that, in general, those defendants who have already been incarcerated should return to
prison for a shorter time than those who have served no time
in prison.

Here, as in other portions of its opinion, the Court ex-presses concern with the apparent harshness of the result if

"original sentence" is interpreted to mean the sentence ofprobation initially imposed on a defendant.

8 In some cases

the result may indeed appear harsh. Yet harsh punishment,in itself, is neither a legitimate ground for invalidating a statute nor cause for injecting ambiguity into a statute that issusceptible to principled statutory construction. See

Calla-nan v. United States, 364 U. S. 587, 596 (1961) ("The rule

[of lenity] comes into operation at the end of the process ofconstruing what Congress has expressed, not at the beginning as an overriding consideration of being lenient towrongdoers"). A straightforward reading of $ 3565(a) may

as to raise a reasonable doubt about Congress' intent."

The Court's interpretation of $ 3565(a), finally, creates anincurable uncertainty: It offers no sound basis for choosing

8 The Court expresses disbelief that Congress could have intended to
authorize punishment for drug-possessing probationers so much more severe than the punishment authorized for the probationer's original offense.
Ante, at 48-49. I think the Court misses two points. First, as the Court
itself seems to recognize, the maximum punishment authorized for respondent's original offense is not the Guidelines range, but the maximum
statutory sentence. See 18 U. S. C. $$ 1703(a), 3553(b), 3559(a)(4), and
3581(b)(4). In respondent's case, the punishment authorized for his original offense is therefore exactly equal to the punishment authorized for his
probation violation--five years' imprisonment. See $ 1703(a). Second,
Congress provided for equally harsh revocation sentences in the subsections preceding and following $ 3565(a). By allowing sentencing courts to
impose "any other sentence that was available . . . at the time of the initial
sentencing," $$ 3565(a)(2) and (b), Congress authorized these courts to
impose the maximum statutory sentence upon revocation of probation.
Thus, if respondent's probation had been revoked pursuant to $$ 3565(a)(2)
or (b), he would have faced the same maximum revocation sentence he
faces under $ 3565(a)--five years' imprisonment.

which point in the Guidelines range should serve as the basisfor calculating a revocation sentence. After describing the

four possible reference points within the range, the Courtselects the maximum available sentence. It rejects selecting a point in the middle of the available range, because todo so "would be purely arbitrary."

Ante, at 55. Yet theCourt does not explain why choosing the top end of the range

is any less arbitrary, or any more "sensible," than picking apoint in the middle of the range. Indeed, the Court's selection smacks of awarding a consolation prize to the Govern-ment simply out of concern that the Government was mistakenly done out of victory in the main event. And choosingthe

maximum possible sentence under the Guidelines hardlyseems consistent with the rule of lenity which the Court purports to apply.9A straightforward reading of $ 3565(a) creates no similar
uncertainty. Because I think the language of $ 3565(a) isclear, I would apply it. Accordingly, I would reverse the
Court of Appeals.

9 The Government suggests that if "original sentence" does not refer to
the sentence of probation imposed, then it might just as readily refer to
the statutory sentence. The Court rejects this suggestion because imposing the maximum statutory sentence would require an upward departure
from the Guidelines range, and probation "is a most unlikely prospect" in
any case involving an upward departure. Ante, at 56, n. 14. Thus, according to the Court, it "makes scant sense" to assume that "original sentence" is the statutory maximum sentence. Ibid. By the same reasoning, however, it makes little sense to assume that the maximum Guidelines
sentence is the "original sentence," as probation is an "unlikely prospect"
in any case where a defendant would otherwise receive the maximum
available sentence under the Guidelines. Indeed, if the plausibility of the
potential sentence is the Court's guide, one would think the Court would
choose the bottom of the Guidelines range as its benchmark.

79OCTOBER TERM, 1993
Syllabus

POWELL v. NEVADA
certiorari to the supreme court of nevada
No. 92-8841. Argued February 22, 1994--Decided March 30, 1994
Petitioner Powell was arrested on November 3, 1989, for felony child

abuse. Not until November 7, however, did a Magistrate find probable
cause to hold him for a preliminary hearing. The child in question subsequently died of her injuries, and Powell was charged additionally with
her murder. At the trial, the state prosecutor presented prejudicial
statements Powell had made to the police on November 7. The jury
found him guilty and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the Nevada
Supreme Court, sua sponte, raised the question whether the 4-day delay
in judicial confirmation of probable cause violated the Fourth Amendment, in view of County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44, which
held that a judicial probable-cause determination must generally be
made within 48 hours of a warrantless arrest, and that, absent extraordinary circumstances, a longer delay is unconstitutional. The state court
decided that McLaughlin was inapplicable to Powell's case, because his
prosecution commenced prior to the rendition of that decision.

Held: The Nevada Supreme Court erred in failing to recognize that

McLaughlin's 48-hour rule must be applied retroactively, for under
Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 328, "a . . . rule for the conduct of
criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or
federal, . . . not yet final" when the rule is announced. Although the
4-day delay here was presumptively unreasonable under McLaughlin,
it does not necessarily follow that Powell must be set free or gain other
relief. Several questions remain open for decision on remand, including
the appropriate remedy for a delay in determining probable cause (an
issue not resolved by McLaughlin), the consequence of Powell's failure
to raise the federal question, and whether introduction at trial of what

Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
In Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103 (1975), we held that the
Fourth Amendment's shield against unreasonable seizuresrequires a prompt judicial determination of probable cause

following an arrest made without a warrant and ensuing de-tention.

County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44
(1991), established that "prompt" generally means within 48hours of the warrantless arrest; absent extraordinary circumstances, a longer delay violates the Fourth Amendment.
In the case now before us, the Supreme Court of Nevadastated that

McLaughlin does not apply to a prosecution commenced prior to the rendition of that decision. We hold thatthe Nevada Supreme Court misread this Court's precedent:

"[A] . . . rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be
applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, . . . not yet
final" when the rule is announced. Griffith v. Kentucky, 479

Opinion of the Court

I
Petitioner Kitrich Powell was arrested on Friday, Novem-ber 3, 1989, for felony child abuse of his girlfriend's 4-yearold daughter, in violation of Nev. Rev. Stat. $ 200.508 (1991).That afternoon, the arresting officer prepared a sworn declaration describing the cause for and circumstances of the ar-rest. Not until November 7, 1989, however, did a Magistrate find probable cause to hold Powell for a preliminaryhearing. That same day, November 7, Powell made statements to the police, prejudicial to him, which the prosecutorlater presented at Powell's trial. Powell was not personally
brought before a Magistrate until November 13, 1989. Bythat time, the child had died of her injuries, and Powell was
charged additionally with her murder.A jury found Powell guilty of first-degree murder and, following a penalty hearing, sentenced him to death. On ap-peal to the Nevada Supreme Court, Powell argued that the
State had violated Nevada's "initial appearance" statute byfailing to bring him before a magistrate within 72 hours, and
that his conviction should therefore be reversed.The Nevada statute governing appearances before a magistrate provides:

"If an arrested person is not brought before a magis-trate within 72 hours after arrest, excluding nonjudicial

days, the magistrate:"(a) Shall give the prosecuting attorney an opportunity to explain the circumstances leading to the delay;and

"(b) May release the arrested person if he determinesthat the person was not brought before a magistrate without unnecessary delay." Nev. Rev. Stat. $ 171.178(3)(1991).

Powell emphasized that 10 days had elapsed between his ar-rest on November 3, 1989, and his November 13 initial appearance before a Magistrate. In view of the incriminating

Opinion of the Court
statements he made on November 7, Powell contended, theunlawful delay was prejudicial to him. Under Nevada law,

Powell asserted, vindication of his right to a speedy firstappearance required that his conviction be reversed, and
that he be set free. Appellant's Opening Brief in No. 22348
(Nev.), p. 85.The district attorney maintained before the Nevada Supreme Court that there had been no fatal violation of Neva-da's initial appearance statute. First, the district attorney
urged, the confirmation of probable cause by a Magistrate onNovember 7 occurred within 72 hours of the November 3
arrest (excluding the intervening weekend). This probablecause finding, the district attorney contended, satisfied the
72-hour prescription of Nev. Rev. Stat. $ 171.178. In any
event, the district attorney continued, under Nevada law, an
accused waives his right to a speedy arraignment when he
voluntarily waives his right to remain silent and his right to
counsel. Powell did so, the district attorney said, when he
made his November 7 statements, after he was read his Miranda rights and waived those rights. See Respondent's
Answering Brief in No. 22348 (Nev.), pp. 56-60. In reply,
Powell vigorously contested the district attorney's portrayal
of the probable-cause determination as tantamount to an initial appearance sufficient to satisfy Nev. Rev. Stat. $ 171.178's
72-hour prescription. Powell pointed out that he "was
neither present [n]or advised of the magistrate's finding."
Appellant's Reply Brief in No. 22348 (Nev.), p. 1.

The Nevada Supreme Court concluded, in accord with the
district attorney's assertion, that Powell had waived his
right under state law to a speedy arraignment. 108 Nev.
700, 705, 838 P. 2d 921, 924-925 (1992). If the Nevada Supreme Court had confined the decision to that point, its opinion would have resolved no federal issue. But the Nevada
Supreme Court said more. Perhaps in response to the district attorney's contention that the Magistrate's November 7
probable-cause notation satisfied Nev. Rev. Stat. $ 171.178 (a

Opinion of the Court
contention the State now disavows), the Nevada SupremeCourt, sua sponte, raised a federal concern. That court detoured from its state-law analysis to inquire whether the No-vember 3 to November 7, 1989, delay in judicial confirmation
of probable cause violated the Fourth Amendment under thisCourt's precedents.

County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44 (1991),the Nevada Supreme Court recognized, made specific the
probable-cause promptness requirement of Gerstein v. Pugh,420 U. S. 103 (1975);

McLaughlin instructed that a delay ex-ceeding 48 hours presumptively violates the Fourth Amendment. Merging the speedy initial appearance required byNevada statute and the prompt probable-cause determination required by the Fourth Amendment, the Nevada Su-preme Court declared: "The

McLaughlin case renders [Nev.Rev. Stat. $ ]171.178(3) unconstitutional insofar [as] it permits

an initial appearance up to seventy-two hours after arrestand instructs that non-judicial days be excluded from the calculation of those hours." 108 Nev., at 705, 838 P. 2d, at 924.While instructing that, henceforth, probable-cause determinations be made within 48 hours of a suspect's arrest, theNevada Supreme Court held

McLaughlin inapplicable "tothe case at hand," because that recent precedent postdated

Powell's arrest. 108 Nev., at 705, n. 1, 838 P. 2d, at 924, n. 1.McLaughlin announced a new rule, the Nevada Supreme
Court observed, and therefore need not be applied retroac-tively. 108 Nev., at 705, n. 1, 838 P. 2d, at 924, n. 1.

Powell petitioned for our review raising the questionwhether a state court may decline to apply a recently rendered Fourth Amendment decision of this Court to a casepending on direct appeal. We granted certiorari, 510 U. S.
811 (1993), and now reject the state court's prospectivitydeclaration.

Powell's arrest was not validated by a magistrate untilfour days elapsed. That delay was presumptively unreason511US1$32Z 06-11-96 20:26:40 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
able under McLaughlin's 48-hour rule. The State so concedes. Appellee's Answer to Petition for Rehearing in No.
22348 (Nev.), p. 7; Tr. of Oral Arg. 28. The State further
concedes that the Nevada Supreme Court's retroactivity
analysis was incorrect. See ibid. We held in Griffith v.
Kentucky, 479 U. S., at 328, that "a new rule for the conduct
of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all
cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet
final." Griffith stressed two points. First, "the nature of
judicial review . . . precludes us from `[s]imply fishing one
case from the stream of appellate review, using it as a vehicle
for pronouncing new constitutional standards, and then permitting a stream of similar cases subsequently to flow by
unaffected by that new rule.' " Id., at 323 (quoting Mackey
v. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 679 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment)). Second, "selective application of
new rules violates the principle of treating similarly situated
defendants the same." Griffith, supra, at 323. Assuming,
arguendo, that the 48-hour presumption announced in McLaughlin qualifies as a "new rule," cf. Teague v. Lane, 489
U. S. 288, 299-310 (1989), Griffith nonetheless entitles Powell
to rely on McLaughlin for this simple reason: Powell's conviction was not final when McLaughlin was announced.

It does not necessarily follow, however, that Powell must
"be set free," 108 Nev., at 705, n. 1, 838 P. 2d, at 924, n. 1, or
gain other relief, for several questions remain open for decision on remand. In particular, the Nevada Supreme Court
has not yet closely considered the appropriate remedy for a
delay in determining probable cause (an issue not resolved
by McLaughlin), or the consequences of Powell's failure to
raise the federal question, or the district attorney's argument that introduction at trial of what Powell said on November 7, 1989, was "harmless" in view of a similar, albeit
shorter, statement Powell made on November 3, prior to his
arrest. See Brief for Respondent 22. Expressing no opin511US1$32Z 06-11-96 20:26:40 PAGES OPINPGT

Court erred in failing to recognize that Griffith v. Kentucky
calls for retroactive application of McLaughlin's 48-hour
rule.

* * *
For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Nevada
Supreme Court is vacated, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice joins,
dissenting.

After concluding that the Nevada Supreme Court erred by
failing to follow our decision in Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S.

*Justice Thomas would reach out and decide the first of these questions, though it is not presented in the petition for review. He would rule
inappropriate "suppression of [Powell's November 7] statement . . . because the statement was not a product of the McLaughlin violation."
Post, at 89. It is "settled law," he maintains, post, at 88, that if probable
cause in fact existed for Powell's detention, then McLaughlin's 48-hour
rule, though violated, triggers no suppression remedy. Quite the opposite, Justice Thomas recognizes, is "settled law" regarding search warrants: A court's postsearch validation of probable cause will not render
the evidence admissible. See Vale v. Louisiana, 399 U. S. 30, 35, 34 (1970)
(absent circumstances justifying a warrantless search, it is "constitutional
error [to] admi[t] into evidence the fruits of the illegal search," "even
though the authorities ha[d] probable cause to conduct it").

Justice Thomas maintains, however, that our precedents, especially
New York v. Harris, 495 U. S. 14 (1990), already establish that no suppression is required in Powell's case. In Harris, we held that violation of the
Fourth Amendment's rule against warrantless arrests in a dwelling, see
Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573 (1980), generally does not lead to the
suppression of a postarrest confession. But Powell does not complain of
police failure to obtain a required arrest warrant. He targets a different
constitutional violation--failure to obtain authorization from a magistrate
for a significant period of pretrial detention. Whether a suppression remedy applies in that setting remains an unresolved question. Because the
issue was not raised, argued, or decided below, we should not settle it here.

Thomas, J., dissenting
314 (1987), the Court remands this case without decidingwhether the ultimate judgment below, despite the error, was

correct. In my view, the lower court's judgment upholdingpetitioner's conviction was correct under settled legal principles, and therefore should be affirmed.

I
The petition for certiorari in this case presented a singlequestion for review--namely, whether a particular decision

of this Court concerning criminal procedure should applyretroactively to all cases pending on direct review. This
question was well settled at the time the petition was filed,and had been since our decision in Griffith, in which we
stated that "a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecu-tions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final." 479 U. S.,at 328. The Nevada Supreme Court made a statement to
the contrary in a footnote in its opinion. See infra, at 87.Notwithstanding this obvious mistake,

Griffith's rule of ret-roactivity had generated little or no confusion among the

lower courts. In my view, under these circumstances, thewrit was improvidently granted.

According to this Court's Rule 10.1, "[a] petition for a writof certiorari will be granted only when there are special and
important reasons therefor." Not only were there no spe-cial or important reasons favoring review in this case, but,
as Justice Stewart once wrote: "The only remarkable thingabout this case is its presence in this Court. For the case
involves no more than the application of well-settled princi-ples to a familiar situation, and has little significance except
for the [parties]." Butz v. Glover Livestock CommissionCo., 411 U. S. 182, 189 (1973) (dissenting opinion). As the
Court has observed in the past, "it is very important thatwe be consistent in not granting the writ of certiorari except
in cases involving principles the settlement of which is ofimportance to the public as distinguished from that of the

parties, and in cases where there is a real and embarrassingconflict of opinion and authority between the circuit courts

of appeal." Layne & Bowler Corp. v. Western Well Works,
Inc., 261 U. S. 387, 393 (1923). We make poor use of judicial
resources when, as here, we take a case merely to reaffirm
(without revisiting) settled law. See generally Estelle v.
Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 115 (1976) (Stevens, J., dissenting);
United States v. Shannon, 342 U. S. 288, 294-295 (1952)(opinion of Frankfurter, J.).

Now that we have invested time and resources in fullbriefing and oral argument, however, we must decide how
properly to dispose of the case. The Court vacates and remands because the Nevada Supreme Court erred, not in its
judgment, but rather in its "prospectivity declaration."
Ante, at 83. The "declaration" to which the Court refers is
the state court's statement that our decision in County of
Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44 (1991), does "not apply
retroactively." 108 Nev. 700, 705, n. 1, 838 P. 2d 921, 924,
n. 1 (1992). The Court correctly rules that McLaughlin
does apply retroactively. See Griffith, supra. Rather than
remanding, I believe that the Court in this instance can and
should definitively resolve the case before us: "Our job . . . is
to review judgments, not to edit opinions . . . ." Phillips
Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U. S. 797, 823 (1985) (Stevens,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). See also
K mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 485 U. S. 176, 185 (1988); Black
v. Cutter Laboratories, 351 U. S. 292, 297 (1956).

Of course, when there is a need for further factfinding or
for proceedings best conducted in the lower courts, or where
the ultimate question to be decided depends on debatable
points of law that have not been briefed or argued, we regularly determine that the best course is to remand. See, e. g.,
Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 574 (1988) (vacating
award of attorney's fees and remanding for recalculation of
fee award). Those concerns, however, do not require a remand in this case. In defense of the judgment below, re511US1$32Z 06-11-96 20:26:40 PAGES OPINPGT

Thomas, J., dissenting
spondent and its amici have properly raised a number ofarguments, see Blum v. Bacon, 457 U. S. 132, 137, n. 5 (1982),

which have been fully briefed. As I explain below, at leastone of those arguments provides a ground for decision that
would require only the application of settled law to the undis-puted facts in the record before us. Under these circumstances, remanding will merely require the needless expendi-ture of further judicial resources on a claim that lacks merit.

II
While in petitioner's care on November 2, 1989, 4-year-oldMelea Allen suffered massive head and spinal injuries.

When petitioner took her to the hospital the following day,November 3, she was comatose and suffering respiratory failure. Petitioner told doctors and nurses that she had fallenfrom his shoulders during play. When emergency room personnel discovered that Melea also had numerous bruises andlacerations on her body--injuries that suggested she had
been abused repeatedly--they called the police. Petitionerspoke to the officers who responded to the call and again
explained that the child's injuries were the result of an acci-dental fall.

Several hours later, the police arrested petitioner for childabuse. Within an hour of the arrest, officers prepared a declaration of arrest that recited the above facts to establishprobable cause. Petitioner was still in custody on November 7, when, after receiving Miranda warnings, he agreed togive a second statement to the police. He repeated the
same version of events he had given at the hospital beforehis arrest, but in slightly more detail. On that same day, a
Magistrate, relying on the facts recited in the declaration ofarrest described above, determined that petitioner's arrest
had been supported by probable cause. The next day Meleadied, and petitioner was charged with first-degree murder.

Petitioner contends that respondent's delay in securing aprompt judicial determination of probable cause to arrest

89Cite as: 511 U. S. 79 (1994)
Thomas, J., dissenting
him for child abuse violated the rule that a probable-cause
determination must, absent extenuating circumstances, be
made by a judicial officer within 48 hours of a warrantless
arrest. McLaughlin, supra. The McLaughlin error, petitioner argues, required suppression of the custodial statement he made on November 7, which was introduced against
him at trial.

Against that argument, respondent and its amici raise
several contentions: first, that suppression of evidence would
never be an appropriate remedy for a McLaughlin violation;
second, that the statement at issue here was not a product
of the McLaughlin error, or at least that the connection between the McLaughlin violation and the statement is so attenuated that suppression is not required; third, that suppression is inappropriate under Illinois v. Krull, 480 U. S.
340 (1987), because the officers acted in good-faith reliance
on a state statute that authorized delays of up to 72 hours
(excluding weekends and holidays) in presenting a defendant
to a magistrate; and finally, that even if the statement should
have been suppressed, admitting it at trial was harmless
error. Even assuming, arguendo, that suppression is a
proper remedy for McLaughlin errors, see ante, at 85, n.,
I believe that, on the facts of this case, suppression of petitioner's statement would not be appropriate because the
statement was not a product of the McLaughlin violation.

Our decisions make clear "that evidence will not be excluded as `fruit' [of an unlawful act] unless the illegality is at
least the `but for' cause of the discovery of the evidence."
Segura v. United States, 468 U. S. 796, 815 (1984). As Segura suggests, "but for" causation is a necessary, but not
sufficient, condition for suppression: "[W]e have declined to
adopt a per se or but for rule that would make inadmissible
any evidence . . . which somehow came to light through a
chain of causation that began with a [violation of the Fourth
or Fifth Amendment]." New York v. Harris, 495 U. S. 14, 17

Thomas, J., dissenting
(1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). See also UnitedStates v. Ceccolini, 435 U. S. 268, 276 (1978).

Contrary to petitioner's arguments, the violation ofMcLaughlin (as opposed to his arrest and custody) bore no
causal relationship whatsoever to his November 7 statement.The timing of the probable-cause determination would have
affected petitioner's statement only if a proper hearing at orbefore the 48-hour mark would have resulted in a finding of
no probable cause. Yet, as the Magistrate found, the policehad probable cause to suspect petitioner of child abuse, cf.
Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213 (1983), and there is no sugges-tion that the delay in securing a determination of probable
cause permitted the police to gather additional evidence tobe presented to the Magistrate. On the contrary, the Magistrate based his determination on the facts included in thedeclaration of arrest that was completed within an hour of
petitioner's arrest. Thus, if the probable-cause determina-tion had been made within 48 hours as required by McLaughlin, the same information would have been presented,the same result would have obtained, and none of the circumstances of petitioner's custody would have been altered.Moreover, it cannot be argued that the

McLaughlin errorsomehow made petitioner's custody unlawful and thereby

rendered the statement the product of unlawful custody. Be-cause the arresting officers had probable cause to arrest petitioner, he was lawfully arrested at the hospital. Cf. Harris,
supra, at 18.1 The presumptively unconstitutional delay in

1 The fact that the arrest was supported by probable cause and was not
investigatory in nature fully distinguishes this case from our decisions in
Taylor v. Alabama, 457 U. S. 687 (1982), Brown v. Illinois, 422 U. S. 590
(1975), and Dunaway v. New York, 442 U. S. 200 (1979). Where probable
cause for an arrest is lacking, as it was in each of those cases, evidence
obtained as a result of the Fourth Amendment violation "bear[s] a sufficiently close relationship to the underlying illegality [to require suppression]." New York v. Harris, 495 U. S. 14, 19 (1990). The presence of
probable cause, by contrast, validates the arrest and attendant custody,
despite " `technical' violations of Fourth Amendment rights" that may

securing a judicial determination of probable cause during aperiod of lawful custody did not render that custody illegal.

We have never suggested that lawful custody becomes un-lawful due to a failure to obtain a prompt judicial finding of
probable cause--that is, probable cause does not disappearif not judicially determined within 48 hours. Cf.

UnitedStates v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U. S. 711, 722 (1990) ("[A]

person does not become immune from detention because ofa timing violation").

In short, the statement does not even meet the thresholdrequirement of being a "product" of the McLaughlin violation.2 Petitioner's statement, "while the product of an arhave occurred during either. Brown, supra, at 611 (Powell, J., concurring
in part). See also Harris, supra, at 18 (holding that even though the
police violated the rule of Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573 (1980), by
arresting a suspect in his house without a warrant, the resulting custody
was lawful because the arrest was supported by probable cause, and that
therefore the suspect's subsequent custodial statement was admissible).

As the Court notes, ante, at 85, n., a different rule applies to search
warrants. In that context, we have insisted that, absent exigent circumstances, police officers obtain a search warrant, even if they had probable
cause to conduct the search, see, e. g., Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403
U. S. 443, 454-455 (1971), and we have required suppression of all fruits
of an unlawful search, unless an exception to the exclusionary rule applies.
See generally Illinois v. Krull, 480 U. S. 340, 347-349 (1987). The same
rule has not been applied to arrests. "[W]hile the Court has expressed a
preference for the use of arrest warrants when feasible, it has never invalidated an arrest supported by probable cause solely because the officers
failed to secure a warrant." Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103, 113 (1975)
(citations omitted). Nor has the Court required suppression of voluntary
custodial statements made after an arrest supported by probable cause
based solely on the officers' failure to obtain a warrant. See Harris,
supra. Petitioner's statement was the product of his arrest and custody,
and there is no reason to think that the rules we have developed in the
search warrant context should apply in this case.

2 Thus, conventional attenuation principles are inapplicable in this case,

for as we pointed out in Harris, "attenuation analysis is only appropriate
where, as a threshold matter, courts determine that `the challenged evidence is in some sense the product of illegal governmental activity.' " 495
U. S., at 19 (quoting United States v. Crews, 445 U. S. 463, 471 (1980)).

OREGON WASTE SYSTEMS, INC. v. DEPARTMENTOF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF THE

STATE OF OREGON et al.
certiorari to the supreme court of oregon
No. 93-70. Argued January 18, 1994--Decided April 4, 1994*
Oregon imposes a $2.25 per ton surcharge on the in-state disposal of solid

waste generated in other States and an $0.85 per ton fee on the disposal
of waste generated within Oregon. Petitioners sought review of the
out-of-state surcharge in the State Court of Appeals, challenging the
administrative rule establishing the surcharge and its enabling statutes
under, inter alia, the Commerce Clause. The court upheld the statutes
and rule, and the State Supreme Court affirmed. Despite the Oregon
statutes' explicit reference to out-of-state waste's geographical location,
the court reasoned, the surcharge's express nexus to actual costs incurred by state and local government rendered it a facially constitutional "compensatory fee."

Held: Oregon's surcharge is facially invalid under the negative Commerce

Clause. Pp. 98-108.

(a) The first step in analyzing a law under the negative Commerce
Clause is to determine whether it discriminates against, or regulates
evenhandedly with only incidental effects on, interstate commerce. If
the restriction is discriminatory--i. e., favors in-state economic interests
over their out-of-state counterparts--it is virtually per se invalid. By
contrast, nondiscriminatory regulations are valid unless the burden
imposed on interstate commerce is "clearly excessive in relation to the
putative local benefits." Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 142.
Oregon's surcharge is obviously discriminatory on its face. It subjects
waste from other States to a fee almost three times greater than the

whether the fee applies is whether or not the waste was generated out

Syllabus

standard for these cases. Thus, the surcharge must be invalidated unless respondents can show that it advances a legitimate local purpose
that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives. Neither of respondents' justifications passes strict scrutiny.
For the surcharge to be justified as a "compensatory tax" necessary to
make shippers of out-of-state waste pay their "fair share" of disposal
costs, it must be the rough equivalent of an identifiable and substantially
similar surcharge on intrastate commerce. However, respondents have
failed to identify a specific charge on intrastate commerce equal to or
exceeding the surcharge; the $0.85 per ton fee on in-state waste is only
about one-third of the challenged surcharge. Even assuming that various other means of general taxation, such as state income taxes, could
serve as a roughly equivalent intrastate burden, respondents' argument
fails because the levies are not imposed on substantially equivalent
events: Taxes on earning income and utilizing Oregon landfills are entirely different kinds of taxes. Nor can the surcharge be justified by
respondents' argument that Oregon has a valid interest in spreading the
costs of the disposal of Oregon waste, but not out-of-state waste, to all
Oregonians. Because Oregon's scheme necessarily results in shippers
of out-of-state waste bearing the full costs of disposal with shippers of
Oregon waste bearing less than the full cost, it necessarily incorporates
an illegitimate protectionist objective. Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502
U. S. 437, 454. Recharacterizing the surcharge as "resource protectionism"--discouraging the importation of out-of-state waste in order to
conserve more landfill space for in-state waste--hardly advances respondents' cause. A State may not accord its own inhabitants a preferred right of access over consumers in other States to its natural resources. Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 627. Sporhase v.

Two Terms ago, in Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v.Hunt, 504 U. S. 334 (1992), we held that the negative Commerce Clause prohibited Alabama from imposing a higherfee on the disposal in Alabama landfills of hazardous waste
from other States than on the disposal of identical wastefrom Alabama. In reaching that conclusion, however, we
left open the possibility that such a differential surchargemight be valid if based on the costs of disposing of waste
from other States. Id., at 346, n. 9. Today, we must decidewhether Oregon's purportedly cost-based surcharge on the
in-state disposal of solid waste generated in other Statesviolates the Commerce Clause.

ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF ORE.

Opinion of the Court

Oregon Department of Environmental Quality oversees theState's regulatory scheme by developing and executing plans

for the management, reduction, and recycling of solid wastes.To fund these and related activities, Oregon levies a wide
range of fees on landfill operators. See, e. g., Ore. Rev. Stat.$$ 459.235(3), 459.310 (1991). In 1989, the Oregon Legislature imposed an additional fee, called a "surcharge," on"every person who disposes of solid waste generated out-ofstate in a disposal site or regional disposal site." $ 459.297(1)(effective Jan. 1, 1991). The amount of that surcharge was
left to respondent Environmental Quality Commission (Com-mission) to determine through rulemaking, but the legislature did require that the resulting surcharge "be based onthe costs to the State of Oregon and its political subdivisions
of disposing of solid waste generated out-of-state which arenot otherwise paid for" under specified statutes. $ 459.298.
At the conclusion of the rulemaking process, the Commissionset the surcharge on out-of-state waste at $2.25 per ton.
Ore. Admin. Rule 340-97-120(7) (Sept. 1993).In conjunction with the out-of-state surcharge, the legislature imposed a fee on the in-state disposal of waste gener-ated within Oregon. See Ore. Rev. Stat. $$ 459A.110(1), (5)
(1991). The in-state fee, capped by statute at $0.85 per ton(originally $0.50 per ton), is considerably lower than the fee
imposed on waste from other States. $$ 459A.110(5) and459A.115. Subsequently, the legislature conditionally extended the $0.85 per ton fee to out-of-state waste, in additionto the $2.25 per ton surcharge, $ 459A.110(6), with the proviso that if the surcharge survived judicial challenge, the$0.85 per ton fee would again be limited to in-state waste.
1991 Ore. Laws, ch. 385, $$ 91-92.2

2 As a result, shippers of out-of-state solid waste currently are being
charged $3.10 per ton to dispose of such waste in Oregon landfills, as compared to the $0.85 per ton fee charged to dispose of Oregon waste in those
same landfills. We refer hereinafter only to the $2.25 surcharge, because

Opinion of the Court
The anticipated court challenge was not long in coming.Petitioners, Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. (Oregon Waste),

and Columbia Resource Company (CRC), joined by GilliamCounty, Oregon, sought expedited review of the out-of-state
surcharge in the Oregon Court of Appeals. Oregon Wasteowns and operates a solid waste landfill in Gilliam County, at
which it accepts for final disposal solid waste generated inOregon and in other States. CRC, pursuant to a 20-year
contract with Clark County, in neighboring WashingtonState, transports solid waste via barge from Clark County
to a landfill in Morrow County, Oregon. Petitioners chal-lenged the administrative rule establishing the out-of-state
surcharge and its enabling statutes under both state law andthe Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.
The Oregon Court of Appeals upheld the statutes and rule.Gilliam County v. Department of Environmental Quality,
114 Ore. App. 369, 837 P. 2d 965 (1992).The State Supreme Court affirmed. Gilliam County v.
Department of Environmental Quality of Oregon, 316 Ore.99, 849 P. 2d 500 (1993). As to the Commerce Clause, the
court recognized that the Oregon surcharge resembled theAlabama fee invalidated in

Chemical Waste Management,Inc. v. Hunt, 504 U. S. 334 (1992), in that both prescribed

higher fees for the disposal of waste from other States. Nev-ertheless, the court viewed the similarity as superficial only.
Despite the explicit reference in $ 459.297(1) to out-of-statewaste's geographic origin, the court reasoned, the Oregon
surcharge is not facially discriminatory "[b]ecause of [its] ex-press nexus to actual costs incurred [by state and local government]." 316 Ore., at 112, 849 P. 2d, at 508. That nexusdistinguished

Chemical Waste, supra, by rendering the sur-charge a "compensatory fee," which the court viewed as

"prima facie reasonable," that is to say, facially constitu-tional. 316 Ore., at 112, 849 P. 2d, at 508. The court read

our case law as invalidating compensatory fees only if theyare " `manifestly disproportionate to the services rendered.' "

Ibid. (quoting Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., 306 U. S. 583, 599(1939)). Because Oregon law restricts the scope of judicial
review in expedited proceedings to deciding the facial legal-ity of administrative rules and the statutes underlying them,
Ore. Rev. Stat. $ 183.400 (1991), the Oregon court deemeditself precluded from deciding the factual question whether
the surcharge on out-of-state waste was disproportionate.316 Ore., at 112, 849 P. 2d, at 508.

States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.3 We nowreverse.

The Commerce Clause provides that "[t]he Congress shallhave Power . . . [t]o regulate Commerce . . . among the several States." Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3. Though phrased as a grantof regulatory power to Congress, the Clause has long been
understood to have a "negative" aspect that denies theStates the power unjustifiably to discriminate against or burden the interstate flow of articles of commerce. See, e. g.,
Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U. S. 437, 454 (1992); Welton v.
Missouri, 91 U. S. 275 (1876). The Framers granted Congress plenary authority over interstate commerce in "theconviction that in order to succeed, the new Union would

have to avoid the tendencies toward economic Balkanization
that had plagued relations among the Colonies and lateramong the States under the Articles of Confederation."

Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U. S. 322, 325-326 (1979). Seegenerally The Federalist No. 42 (J. Madison). "This principle that our economic unit is the Nation, which alone has thegamut of powers necessary to control of the economy, . . . has

as its corollary that the states are not separable economicunits."

H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U. S. 525,
537-538 (1949).Consistent with these principles, we have held that the first

step in analyzing any law subject to judicial scrutiny under
the negative Commerce Clause is to determine whether it"regulates evenhandedly with only `incidental' effects on interstate commerce, or discriminates against interstate com-merce."

Hughes, supra, at 336. See also Chemical Waste,
504 U. S., at 340-341. As we use the term here, "discrimina-tion" simply means differential treatment of in-state and

out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and
burdens the latter. If a restriction on commerce is discriminatory, it is virtually per se invalid. Id., at 344, n. 6. See
also Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 624 (1978).
By contrast, nondiscriminatory regulations that have only
incidental effects on interstate commerce are valid unless
"the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive
in relation to the putative local benefits." Pike v. Bruce
Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970).

In Chemical Waste, we easily found Alabama's surcharge
on hazardous waste from other States to be facially discriminatory because it imposed a higher fee on the disposal of
out-of-state waste than on the disposal of identical in-state
waste. 504 U. S., at 342. We deem it equally obvious here
that Oregon's $2.25 per ton surcharge is discriminatory on
its face. The surcharge subjects waste from other States to
a fee almost three times greater than the $0.85 per ton
charge imposed on solid in-state waste. The statutory
determinant for which fee applies to any particular shipment of solid waste to an Oregon landfill is whether or not
the waste was "generated out-of-state." Ore. Rev. Stat.

$ 459.297(1) (1991). It is well established, however, that a
law is discriminatory if it " `tax[es] a transaction or incident
more heavily when it crosses state lines than when it occurs
entirely within the State.' " Chemical Waste, supra, at 342

U. S. 266, 286 (1987).4Respondents argue, and the Oregon Supreme Court held,
that the statutory nexus between the surcharge and "the[otherwise uncompensated] costs to the State of Oregon and
its political subdivisions of disposing of solid waste generatedout-of-state," Ore. Rev. Stat. $ 459.298 (1991), necessarily
precludes a finding that the surcharge is discriminatory. Wefind respondents' narrow focus on Oregon's compensatory

Chemical Waste, the purpose of, or justification for, a lawhas no bearing on whether it is facially discriminatory. See

504 U. S., at 340-341. See also Philadelphia, supra, at 626.Consequently, even if the surcharge merely recoups the costs
of disposing of out-of-state waste in Oregon, the fact remainsthat the differential charge favors shippers of Oregon waste
over their counterparts handling waste generated in otherStates. In making that geographic distinction, the surcharge patently discriminates against interstate commerce.

amount that it cannot be considered discriminatory, even though the surcharge expressly applies only to waste generated in other States. Post,

degree of a differential burden or charge on interstate commerce "measures only the extent of the discrimination" and "is of no relevance to the
determination whether a State has discriminated against interstate commerce." Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U. S. 437, 455 (1992). See also, e. g.,

Our cases require that justifications for discriminatoryrestrictions on commerce pass the "strictest scrutiny."
Hughes, 441 U. S., at 337. The State's burden of justificationis so heavy that "facial discrimination by itself may be a fatal
defect." Ibid. See also Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. Tully,466 U. S. 388, 406-407 (1984);

Maryland v. Louisiana, 451U. S. 725, 759-760 (1981).

At the outset, we note two justifications that respondentshave

not presented. No claim has been made that the dis-posal of waste from other States imposes higher costs on

Oregon and its political subdivisions than the disposal of in-state waste.

5 Also, respondents have not offered any safety

or health reason unique to nonhazardous waste from other
States for discouraging the flow of such waste into Oregon.
Cf. Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131 (1986) (upholding ban onimportation of out-of-state baitfish into Maine because such

baitfish were subject to parasites completely foreign toMaine baitfish). Consequently, respondents must come forward with other legitimate reasons to subject waste fromother States to a higher charge than is levied against waste
from Oregon.

5 In fact, the Commission fixed the $2.25 per ton cost of disposing of solid
waste in Oregon landfills without reference to the origin of the waste, 3
Record 665-690, and Oregon's economic consultant recognized that the per
ton costs are the same for both in-state and out-of-state waste. Id., at
731-732, 744. Of course, if out-of-state waste did impose higher costs on
Oregon than in-state waste, Oregon could recover the increased cost
through a differential charge on out-of-state waste, for then there would
be a "reason, apart from its origin, why solid waste coming from outside
the [State] should be treated differently." Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, 504 U. S. 353, 361 (1992).

102 OREGON WASTE SYSTEMS, INC. v. DEPARTMENT OF

ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF ORE.

Opinion of the Court

Respondents offer two such reasons, each of which weaddress below.

A
Respondents' principal defense of the higher surcharge onout-of-state waste is that it is a "compensatory tax" necessary to make shippers of such waste pay their "fair share" ofthe costs imposed on Oregon by the disposal of their waste
in the State. In Chemical Waste we noted the possibilitythat such an argument might justify a discriminatory surcharge or tax on out-of-state waste. See 504 U. S., at 346,n. 9. In making that observation, we implicitly recognized
the settled principle that interstate commerce may be madeto " `pay its way.' " Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady,
430 U. S. 274, 281 (1977). See also Maryland, supra, at 754."It was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve
those engaged in interstate commerce from their just shareof state tax burden[s]."

Western Live Stock v. Bureau ofRevenue, 303 U. S. 250, 254 (1938). See also Henneford v.

Silas Mason Co., 300 U. S. 577 (1937). Nevertheless, one ofthe central purposes of the Clause was to prevent States
from "exacting more than a just share" from interstate com-merce. Department of Revenue of Wash. v. Association of
Wash. Stevedoring Cos., 435 U. S. 734, 748 (1978) (emphasisadded). See also

Northwestern States Portland Cement Co.v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450, 462 (1959).

At least since our decision in Hinson v. Lott, 8 Wall. 148(1869), these principles have found expression in the "compensatory" or "complementary" tax doctrine. Though ourcases sometimes discuss the concept of the compensatory tax
as if it were a doctrine unto itself, it is merely a specificway of justifying a facially discriminatory tax as achieving
a legitimate local purpose that cannot be achieved throughnondiscriminatory means. See

Chemical Waste, supra, at346, n. 9 (referring to the compensatory tax doctrine as a

"justif[ication]" for a facially discriminatory tax). Underthat doctrine, a facially discriminatory tax that imposes on

Opinion of the Court
interstate commerce the rough equivalent of an identifiableand "substantially similar" tax on intrastate commerce does

not offend the negative Commerce Clause. Maryland,supra, at 758-759. See also Tyler Pipe Industries, Inc. v.
Washington State Dept. of Revenue, 483 U. S. 232, 242-243(1987);

Armco, 467 U. S., at 643.To justify a charge on interstate commerce as a compensatory tax, a State must, as a threshold matter, "identif[y] . . .the [intrastate tax] burden for which the State is attempting to compensate." Maryland, supra, at 758. Once thatburden has been identified, the tax on interstate commerce
must be shown roughly to approximate--but not exceed--the amount of the tax on intrastate commerce. See,

e. g.,Alaska v. Arctic Maid, 366 U. S. 199, 204-205 (1961). Finally, the events on which the interstate and intrastate taxesare imposed must be "substantially equivalent"; that is, they
must be sufficiently similar in substance to serve as mutuallyexclusive "prox[ies]" for each other.

Armco, supra, at 643.
As Justice Cardozo explained for the Court in Henneford,
under a truly compensatory tax scheme "the stranger fromafar is subject to no greater burdens as a consequence of

ownership than the dweller within the gates. The one paysupon one activity or incident, and the other upon another,
but the sum is the same when the reckoning is closed." 300U. S., at 584.

6 The Oregon Supreme Court, though terming the out-of-state surcharge
a "compensatory fee," relied for its legal standard on our "user fee" cases.
See 316 Ore. 99, 112, 849 P. 2d 500, 508 (1993) (citing, for example,
Evansville-Vanderburgh Airport Authority Dist. v. Delta Airlines, Inc.,
405 U. S. 707 (1972), and Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., 306 U. S. 583 (1939)).
The compensatory tax cases cited in the text, rather than the user fee
cases, are controlling here, as the latter apply only to "charge[s] imposed
by the State for the use of state-owned or state-provided transportation
or other facilities and services." Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana,
453 U. S. 609, 621 (1981). Because it is undisputed that, as in Chemical
Waste, the landfills in question are owned by private entities, including
Oregon Waste, the out-of-state surcharge is plainly not a user fee. Nev511us1$33N 11-04-97 19:32:37 PAGES OPINPGT
104 OREGON WASTE SYSTEMS, INC. v. DEPARTMENT OF

ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF ORE.

Opinion of the Court

Although it is often no mean feat to determine whether achallenged tax is a compensatory tax, we have little difficulty

concluding that the Oregon surcharge is not such a tax. Or-egon does not impose a specific charge of at least $2.25 per
ton on shippers of waste generated in Oregon, for which theout-of-state surcharge might be considered compensatory.
In fact, the only analogous charge on the disposal of Oregonwaste is $0.85 per ton, approximately one-third of the
amount imposed on waste from other States. See Ore. Rev.Stat. $$ 459A.110(5), 459A.115 (1991). Respondents' failure
to identify a specific charge on intrastate commerce equalto or exceeding the surcharge is fatal to their claim. See
Maryland, 451 U. S., at 758.Respondents argue that, despite the absence of a specific
$2.25 per ton charge on in-state waste, intrastate commercedoes pay its share of the costs underlying the surcharge
through general taxation.7 Whether or not that is true isdifficult to determine, as "[general] tax payments are received for the general purposes of the [government], and are,upon proper receipt, lost in the general revenues." Flast v.
Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, 128 (1968) (Harlan, J., dissenting). Evenassuming, however, that various other means of general taxation, such as income taxes, could serve as an identifiableintrastate burden roughly equivalent to the out-of-state surcharge, respondents' compensatory tax argument fails be-cause the in-state and out-of-state levies are not imposed on
substantially equivalent events.

ertheless, even if the surcharge could somehow be viewed as a user fee,
it could not be sustained as such, given that it discriminates against interstate commerce. See Evansville, supra, at 717; Guy v. Baltimore, 100
U. S. 434 (1880). Cf. Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. County of Kent, 510 U. S.
355, 369 (1994) (A user fee is valid only to the extent it "does not discriminate against interstate commerce").

7 We would note that respondents, like the dissent, post, at 112, ignore

the fact that shippers of waste from other States in all likelihood pay
income taxes in other States, a portion of which might well be used to
pay for waste reduction activities in those States.

Opinion of the Court
The prototypical example of substantially equivalent tax-able events is the sale and use of articles of trade. See Henneford, supra. In fact, use taxes on products purchased outof state are the only taxes we have upheld in recent memory
under the compensatory tax doctrine. See ibid. Typifyingour recent reluctance to recognize new categories of compensatory taxes is Armco, where we held that manufacturingand wholesaling are not substantially equivalent events.
467 U. S., at 643. In our view, earning income and disposingof waste at Oregon landfills are even less equivalent than
manufacturing and wholesaling. Indeed, the very fact thatin-state shippers of out-of-state waste, such as Oregon
Waste, are charged the out-of-state surcharge even thoughthey pay Oregon income taxes refutes respondents' argument that the respective taxable events are substantiallyequivalent. See ibid. We conclude that, far from being
substantially equivalent, taxes on earning income and utiliz-ing Oregon landfills are "entirely different kind[s] of tax[es]."
Washington v. United States, 460 U. S. 536, 546, n. 11 (1983).We are no more inclined here than we were in

Respondents' final argument is that Oregon has an interestin spreading the costs of the in-state disposal of Oregon

waste to all Oregonians. That is, because all citizens of Ore8 Furthermore, permitting discriminatory taxes on interstate commerce

106 OREGON WASTE SYSTEMS, INC. v. DEPARTMENT OF

ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF ORE.

Opinion of the Court

gon benefit from the proper in-state disposal of waste fromOregon, respondents claim it is only proper for Oregon to

require them to bear more of the costs of disposing of suchwaste in the State through a higher general tax burden. At
the same time, however, Oregon citizens should not be re-quired to bear the costs of disposing of out-of-state waste,
respondents claim. The necessary result of that limited costshifting is to require shippers of out-of-state waste to bear
the full costs of in-state disposal, but to permit shippers ofOregon waste to bear less than the full cost.

We fail to perceive any distinction between respondents'contention and a claim that the State has an interest in reducing the costs of handling in-state waste. Our cases con-demn as illegitimate, however, any governmental interest
that is not "unrelated to economic protectionism," Wyoming,502 U. S., at 454, and regulating interstate commerce in such
a way as to give those who handle domestic articles of com-merce a cost advantage over their competitors handling similar items produced elsewhere constitutes such protectionism.See

New Energy, 486 U. S., at 275.9 To give controlling ef-fect to respondents' characterization of Oregon's tax scheme

as seemingly benign cost spreading would require us to over-look the fact that the scheme necessarily incorporates a protectionist objective as well. Cf. Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v.
Dias, 468 U. S. 263, 273 (1984) (rejecting Hawaii's attempt tojustify a discriminatory tax exemption for local liquor pro9 We recognize that "[t]he Commerce Clause does not prohibit all state
action designed to give its residents an advantage in the marketplace, but
only action of that description in connection with the State's regulation
of interstate commerce." New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S.
269, 278 (1988). Cf. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 470 U. S. 869, 877,
n. 6 (1985). Here, as in New Energy, we confront a patently discriminatory law that is plainly connected to the regulation of interstate commerce.
We therefore have no occasion to decide whether Oregon could validly
accomplish its limited cost spreading through the "market participant"
doctrine, Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794, 806-810 (1976),
or other means unrelated to any regulation of interstate commerce.

Opinion of the Court
ducers as conferring a benefit on them, as opposed to burden-ing out-of-state liquor producers).

Respondents counter that if Oregon is engaged in any formof protectionism, it is "resource protectionism," not economic
protectionism. It is true that by discouraging the flow of
out-of-state waste into Oregon landfills, the higher surchargeon waste from other States conserves more space in those

landfills for waste generated in Oregon. Recharacterizingthe surcharge as resource protectionism hardly advances
respondents' cause, however. Even assuming that landfillspace is a "natural resource," "a State may not accord its
own inhabitants a preferred right of access over consumers
in other States to natural resources located within its borders." Philadelphia, 437 U. S., at 627. As we held more
than a century ago, "if the State, under the guise of exerting
its police powers, should [impose a burden] . . . applicable
solely to articles [of commerce] . . . produced or manufactured
in other States, the courts would find no difficulty in holding
such legislation to be in conflict with the Constitution of
the United States." Guy v. Baltimore, 100 U. S. 434, 443
(1880).

Our decision in Sporhase v. Nebraska ex rel. Douglas, 458
U. S. 941 (1982), is not to the contrary. There we held that
a State may grant a "limited preference" for its citizens in
the utilization of ground water. Id., at 956. That holding
was premised on several different factors tied to the simple
fact of life that "water, unlike other natural resources, is essential for human survival." Id., at 952. Sporhase therefore provides no support for respondents' position that
States may erect a financial barrier to the flow of waste from
other States into Oregon landfills. See Fort Gratiot, 504
U. S., at 364-365, and n. 6. However serious the shortage
in landfill space may be, post, at 108, "[n]o State may attempt
to isolate itself from a problem common to the several States
by raising barriers to the free flow of interstate trade."

ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF ORE.

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting

We recognize that the States have broad discretion to con-figure their systems of taxation as they deem appropriate.

See, e. g., Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S.609, 622-623 (1981);

Boston Stock Exchange v. State TaxComm'n, 429 U. S. 318, 336-337 (1977). All we intimate

here is that their discretion in this regard, as in all others,is bounded by any relevant limitations of the Federal Constitution, in these cases the negative Commerce Clause. Be-cause respondents have offered no legitimate reason to subject waste generated in other States to a discriminatorysurcharge approximately three times as high as that imposed
on waste generated in Oregon, the surcharge is facially in-valid under the negative Commerce Clause. Accordingly,
the judgment of the Oregon Supreme Court is reversed, andthe cases are remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Blackmun joins, dissenting.

Landfill space evaporates as solid waste accumulates.State and local governments expend financial and political

capital to develop trash control systems that are efficient,lawful, and protective of the environment. The State of
Oregon responsibly attempted to address its solid wastedisposal problem through enactment of a comprehensive regulatory scheme for the management, disposal, reduction,and recycling of solid waste. For this Oregon should be
applauded. The regulatory scheme included a fee chargedon out-of-state solid waste. The Oregon Legislature directed the Environmental Quality Commission to determinethe appropriate surcharge "based on the costs . . . of disposing of solid waste generated out-of-state." Ore. Rev. Stat.$ 459.298 (1991). The Commission arrived at a surcharge
of $2.25 per ton, compared to the $0.85 per ton charged on

in-state solid waste. Ore. Admin. Rule 340-97-110(3) (Sept.1993).

1 The surcharge works out to an increase of about

$0.14 per week for the typical out-of-state solid waste pro-ducer.

2 Brief for Respondents 26-27, n. 16. This seems a

small price to pay for the right to deposit your "garbage,rubbish, refuse . . . ; sewage sludge, septic tank and cesspool

pumpings or other sludge; . . . manure, . . . dead animals,
[and] infectious waste" on your neighbors. Ore. Rev. Stat.$ 459.005(27) (1991).

Nearly 20 years ago, we held that a State cannot ban allout-of-state waste disposal in protecting themselves from
hazardous or noxious materials brought across the State'sborders.

Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617 (1978).
Two Terms ago in Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v.
Hunt, 504 U. S. 334 (1992), in striking down the State of Alabama's $72 per ton fee on the disposal of out-of-state hazardous waste, the Court left open the possibility that such a fee
could be valid if based on the costs of disposing of waste
from other States. Id., at 346, n. 9. Once again, however,
as in Philadelphia and Chemical Waste Management, the
Court further cranks the dormant Commerce Clause ratchet
against the States by striking down such cost-based fees, and
by so doing ties the hands of the States in addressing the
vexing national problem of solid waste disposal. I dissent.

1 The surcharge is composed of the following identified costs: $0.58--
statewide activities for reducing environmental risks and improving solid
waste management; $0.66--reimbursements to the State for tax credits
and other public subsidies; $0.05--solid waste reduction activities related
to the review and certification of waste reduction and recycling plans;
$0.72--increased environmental liability; $0.20--lost disposal capacity;
$0.03--publicly supported infrastructure; and $0.01--nuisance impacts
from transportation. Pet. for Cert. in No. 93-108, p. 4.

2 The $2.25 per ton fee imposed on out-of-state waste exceeds the $0.85

per ton fee imposed on in-state waste by $1.40 per ton. One ton equals
2,000 pounds. Assuming that the hypothetical nonresident generates 200
pounds of garbage per month (1/10 of a ton), the nonresident's garbage bill
would increase by $0.14 per month.

110 OREGON WASTE SYSTEMS, INC. v. DEPARTMENT OF

ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF ORE.

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting

Americans generated nearly 196 million tons of municipal
solid waste in 1990, an increase from 128 million tons in 1975.
See U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, Characterization of Municipal Solid Waste in the United States: 1992 Update, p. ES-3. Under current projections, Americans will
produce 222 million tons of garbage in the year 2000. Ibid.
Generating solid waste has never been a problem. Finding
environmentally safe disposal sites has. By 1991, it was
estimated that 45 percent of all solid waste landfills in the
Nation had reached capacity. 56 Fed. Reg. 50980 (1991).
Nevertheless, the Court stubbornly refuses to acknowledge
that a clean and healthy environment, unthreatened by the
improper disposal of solid waste, is the commodity really at
issue in cases such as these, see, e. g., Chemical Waste Management, supra, at 350 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting), and
Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Michigan Dept. of
Natural Resources, 504 U. S. 353, 368 (1992) (Rehnquist,
C. J., dissenting).

Notwithstanding the identified shortage of landfill space in
the Nation, the Court notes that it has "little difficulty,"
ante, at 104, concluding that the Oregon surcharge does not
operate as a compensatory tax, designed to offset the loss of
available landfill space in the State caused by the influx of
out-of-state waste. The Court reaches this nonchalant conclusion because the State has failed "to identify a specific
charge on intrastate commerce equal to or exceeding the surcharge." Ibid. (emphasis added). The Court's myopic focus
on "differential fees" ignores the fact that in-state producers
of solid waste support the Oregon regulatory program
through state income taxes and by paying, indirectly, the numerous fees imposed on landfill operators and the dumping
fee on in-state waste. Ore. Rev. Stat. $ 459.005 et seq. (1991).

We confirmed in Sporhase v. Nebraska ex rel. Douglas,
458 U. S. 941 (1982), that a State may enact a comprehensive
regulatory system to address an environmental problem or

a threat to natural resources within the confines of the Commerce Clause. In the context of threatened ground water
depletion, we stated that "[o]bviously, a State that imposes
severe withdrawal and use restrictions on its own citizens is
not discriminating against interstate commerce when it
seeks to prevent the uncontrolled transfer of water out of
the State." Id., at 955-956. The same point could be made
about a "clean and safe environment" in these cases: Where
a State imposes restrictions on the ability of its own citizens
to dispose of solid waste in an effort to promote a "clean and
safe environment," it is not discriminating against interstate
commerce by preventing the uncontrolled transfer of out-ofstate solid waste into the State.

The availability of safe landfill disposal sites in Oregon did
not occur by chance. Through its regulatory scheme, the
State of Oregon inspects landfill sites, monitors waste
streams, promotes recycling, and imposes an $0.85 per ton
disposal fee on in-state waste, Ore. Rev. Stat. $ 459.005 et seq.
(1991), all in an effort to curb the threat that its residents
will harm the environment and create health and safety
problems through excessive and unmonitored solid waste disposal. Depletion of a clean and safe environment will follow
if Oregon must accept out-of-state waste at its landfills without a sharing of the disposal costs. The Commerce Clause
does not require a State to abide this outcome where the
"natural resource has some indicia of a good publicly
produced and owned in which a State may favor its own
citizens in times of shortage." Sporhase, supra, at 957. A
shortage of available landfill space is upon us, 56 Fed. Reg.
50980 (1991), and with it comes the accompanying health and
safety hazards flowing from the improper disposal of solid
wastes. We have long acknowledged a distinction between
economic protectionism and health and safety regulation
promulgated by Oregon. See H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v.
Du Mond, 336 U. S. 525, 533 (1949).

112 OREGON WASTE SYSTEMS, INC. v. DEPARTMENT OF

ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF ORE.

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting

Far from neutralizing the economic situation for Oregonproducers and out-of-state producers, the Court's analysis

turns the Commerce Clause on its head. Oregon's neighborswill operate under a competitive advantage against their
Oregon counterparts as they can now produce solid waste
with reckless abandon and avoid paying concomitant statetaxes to develop new landfills and clean up retired landfill

sites. While I understand that solid waste is an article ofcommerce,

Philadelphia, 437 U. S., at 622-623, it is not a
commodity sold in the marketplace; rather it is disposedof at a cost to the State. Petitioners do not buy garbage to

put in their landfills; solid waste producers pay petitioners
to take their waste. Oregon solid waste producers do not
compete with out-of-state businesses in the sale of solid
waste. Thus, the fees do not alter the price of a product
that is competing with other products for common purchasers. If anything, striking down the fees works to the disadvantage of Oregon businesses. They alone will have to
pay the "nondisposal" fees associated with solid waste: landfill siting, landfill cleanup, insurance to cover environmental
accidents, and transportation improvement costs associated
with out-of-state waste being shipped into the State. While
we once recognized that " `the collection and disposal of solid
wastes should continue to be primarily the function of State,
regional, and local agencies,' " id., at 621, n. 4, quoting 42
U. S. C. $ 6901(a)(4) (1976 ed.), the Court today leaves States
with only two options: become a dumper and ship as much
waste as possible to a less populated State, or become a dumpee, and stoically accept waste from more densely populated States.

The Court asserts that the State has not offered "any
safety or health reason[s]" for discouraging the flow of solid
waste into Oregon. Ante, at 101. I disagree. The availability of environmentally sound landfill space and the proper
disposal of solid waste strike me as justifiable "safety or
health" rationales for the fee. As far back as the turn of the

113Cite as: 511 U. S. 93 (1994)
Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
century, the Court recognized that control over the collection
and disposal of solid waste was a legitimate, nonarbitrary
exercise of police powers to protect health and safety. See,
e. g., California Reduction Co. v. Sanitary Reduction Works,
199 U. S. 306 (1905) (holding that exclusive privilege to one
company to dispose of the garbage in the city and county of
San Francisco was not void as taking the property of householders for public use without compensation); and Gardner
v. Michigan, 199 U. S. 325 (1905) (holding that property
rights of individuals must be subordinated to the general
good and if the owner of garbage suffers any loss by its destruction he is compensated therefor in the common benefit
secured by the regulation requiring that all garbage be
destroyed).

In exercising its legitimate police powers in regulating
solid waste disposal, Oregon is not "needlessly obstruct[ing]
interstate trade or attempt[ing] to place itself in a position
of economic isolation." Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131, 151
(1986) (internal quotation marks omitted) (upholding Maine's
ban on the importation of live baitfish on the ground that
it serves the legitimate governmental interest in protecting
Maine's indigenous fish population from parasites prevalent
in out-of-state baitfish). Quite to the contrary, Oregon accepts out-of-state waste as part of its comprehensive solid
waste regulatory program and it "retains broad regulatory
authority to protect the health and safety of its citizens and
the integrity of its natural resources." Ibid. Moreover,
Congress also has recognized taxes as an effective method
of discouraging consumption of natural resources in other
contexts. Cf. 26 U. S. C. $$ 4681, 4682 (1988 ed., Supp. IV)
(tax on ozone-depleting chemicals); 26 U. S. C. $ 4064 (1988
ed. and Supp. IV) (gas guzzler excise tax). Nothing should
change the analysis when the natural resource--landfill
space--was created or regulated by the State in the first
place.

114 OREGON WASTE SYSTEMS, INC. v. DEPARTMENT OF

ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF ORE.

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting

In its sweeping ruling, the Court makes no distinction be-tween publicly and privately owned landfills. It rejects the

argument that our "user fee" cases apply in this contextsince the landfills owned by the petitioners are private and
our user fee analysis applies only to " `charge[s] imposed by
the State for the use of a state-owned or state-providedtransportation or other facilities and services.' "

Ante, at
103, n. 6, quoting Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana,453 U. S. 609, 621 (1981). Rather than stopping there, however, the majority goes on to note that even if the Oregonsurcharge could be viewed as a user fee, "it could not be
sustained as such, given that it discriminates against interstate commerce." Ante, at 104, n. 6, citing EvansvilleVanderburgh Airport Authority Dist. v. Delta Airlines, Inc.,
405 U. S. 707, 717 (1972). There is no need to make this
dubious assertion. We specifically left unanswered the
question whether a state or local government could regulate
disposal of out-of-state solid waste at landfills owned by the
government in Philadelphia, supra, at 627, n. 6.

We will undoubtedly be faced with this question directly
in the future as roughly 80 percent of landfills receiving municipal solid waste in the United States are state or locally
owned. U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, Subtitle D Study: Phase 1
Report, p. 4-7 (Oct. 1986) (Table 4-2). We noted in SouthCentral Timber Development, Inc. v. Wunnicke, 467 U. S.
82, 93 (1984): "[I]f a State is acting as a market participant,
rather than as a market regulator, the dormant Commerce
Clause places no limitation on its activities." See also Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U. S. 437, 459 (1992). Similarly, if
the State owned and operated a park or recreational facility,
it would be allowed to charge differential fees for in-state
and out-of-state users of the resource. See, e. g., Baldwin v.
Fish and Game Comm'n of Mont., 436 U. S. 371 (1978) (upholding Montana's higher nonresident elk hunting license
fees to compensate the State for conservation expenditures

from taxes which only residents pay). More recently we up-held such differential fees under a reasonableness standard

in Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. County of Kent, 510 U. S. 355(1994), despite the fact that the fees were not precisely tied
to the costs of the services provided at the publicly owned
airport. We relied on our Commerce Clause analysis from
Evansville, supra. We stated in Evansville:

"At least so long as the toll is based on some fair approximation of use or privilege for use, . . . and is neitherdiscriminatory against interstate commerce nor excessive in comparison with the governmental benefit conferred, it will pass constitutional muster, even thoughsome other formula might reflect more exactly the relative use of the state facilities by individual users." Id.,at 716-717.

I think that the $2.25 per ton fee that Oregon imposes onout-of-state waste works out to a similar "fair approximation" of the privilege to use its landfills. Even the Courtconcedes that our precedents do not demand anything beyond "substantia[l] equivalen[cy]" between the fees chargedon in-state and out-of-state waste.

Ante, at 103 (internal
quotation marks omitted). The $0.14 per week fee imposedon out-of-state waste producers qualifies as "substantially

equivalent" under the reasonableness standard of Northwest
Airlines and Evansville.The Court begrudgingly concedes that interstate commerce may be made to "pay its way," ante, at 102 (internalquotation marks omitted), yet finds Oregon's nominal surcharge to exact more than a " `just share' " from interstate
commerce, ibid. It escapes me how an additional $0.14 per
week cost for the average solid waste producer constitutes
anything but the type of "incidental effects on interstate
commerce" endorsed by the majority. Ante, at 99. Evenhanded regulations imposing such incidental effects on interstate commerce must be upheld unless "the burden imposed

on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the puta-tive local benefits." Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S.

137, 142 (1970). If the majority finds $0.14 per week beyondthe pale, one is left to wonder what the Court possibly could
have contemplated when it stated:

" `[I]n the absence of conflicting legislation by Congress,there is a residuum of power in the state to make laws

governing matters of local concern which neverthelessin some measure affect interstate commerce or even, to
some extent, regulate it.' " Hunt v. Washington StateApple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333, 350 (1977),
quoting Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona ex rel. Sulli-van, 325 U. S. 761, 767 (1945).

Surely $0.14 per week falls within even the most crabbeddefinition of "affect" or "regulate." Today the majority has
rendered this "residuum of power" a nullity.The State of Oregon is not prohibiting the export of solid
waste from neighboring States; it is only asking that thoseneighbors pay their fair share for the use of Oregon landfill
sites. I see nothing in the Commerce Clause that compelsless densely populated States to serve as the low-cost dumping grounds for their neighbors, suffering the attendant risksthat solid waste landfills present. The Court, deciding otherwise, further limits the dwindling options available toStates as they contend with the environmental, health,
safety, and political challenges posed by the problem of solidwaste disposal in modern society.

For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.

BROWN et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 92-1988. Argued March 1, 1994--Decided April 4, 1994
Respondents were members of a class whose money damages claims were

settled in a suit filed against petitioner title insurance companies. The
class was certified under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1)(A)
and (b)(2), which do not permit class members to opt out of a class.
When respondent Brown subsequently filed the present action on behalf
of Arizona and Wisconsin title insurance consumers, the District Court
granted petitioners summary judgment on the ground that respondents
were bound by the earlier judgment. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that it would violate due process to accord res judicata effect to a
judgment involving money damages claims where a plaintiff to the previous suit had not been afforded a right to opt out.

Held: Because deciding this case would require the Court to resolve a

constitutional question that may be entirely hypothetical, the writ is
dismissed as improvidently granted. The Court would not have to
reach the question whether absent class members have a constitutional
right to opt out of actions involving money damages if it turned out that
classes in such actions can be certified only under Rule 23(b)(3), which
permits opt out. However, the determination that respondents' class
fit within Rules 23(b)(1)(A) and (b)(2) is conclusive upon these parties,
and the alternative of using the Federal Rules instead of the Constitution as a means of imposing an opt-out requirement on this settlement
is no longer available. Further, it is not clear that our resolution of the
constitutional question will make any difference even to these litigants.

from petitioners during a future 1-year period, and payment
of attorney's fees and costs of the lawsuit. The District
Court provisionally certified the settlement class (as stipulated by the class representatives and petitioners) under
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1) and (b)(2), and provisionally accepted the settlement.

At the ensuing final settlement hearing, the State of Wisconsin objected to the proposed settlement both as a class
member and as parens patriae for its resident class members, claiming that the action could not be certified under
Rule 23(b)(2) because the relief sought in the complaints was
primarily monetary. Wisconsin also claimed (and was joined
in this by the State of Arizona, both as a class member and
as parens patriae) that due process required that the proposed class members have an opportunity to opt out of the

class. The District Court ultimately rejected these objections, certified the classes under Rules 23(b)(1)(A) and
(b)(2),* and accepted the settlement. The Third Circuit affirmed without opinion, In re Real Estate Title and Settlement Services Antitrust Litigation, 815 F. 2d 695 (1987)
( judgment order), and we denied certiorari, 485 U. S. 909
(1988).

In 1990, respondent Brown filed the present action in District Court in Arizona on behalf of Arizona and Wisconsin
title insurance consumers, alleging that petitioners had conspired to fix rates for title-search services in those States in
violation of the federal antitrust laws. The District Court
granted petitioners summary judgment on the ground,
among others, that respondents, as parties to the MDL No.
633 suit, were bound by the judgment entered pursuant to
the settlement. The Ninth Circuit reversed, accepting respondents' contention that it would violate due process to
accord res judicata effect to a judgment in a class action that
involved money damages claims (or perhaps that involved
primarily money damages claims) against a plaintiff in the
previous suit who had not been afforded a right to opt out on
those claims. 982 F. 2d 386, 392 (1992). Before the Ninth
Circuit, respondents did not (and indeed could not) challenge
whether the class in the MDL No. 633 litigation was properly
certified under Rules 23(b)(1)(A) and (b)(2). And in this
Court, petitioners present only a single question--viz.,
"[w]hether a federal court may refuse to enforce a prior federal class action judgment, properly certified under Rule 23,

*Certification under Rule 23(b)(1)(A) requires that the prosecution of
separate actions would create a risk of "inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class."
Certification under Rule 23(b)(2) requires that "the party opposing the
class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the
class, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding
declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole."

on grounds that absent class members have a constitutionaldue process right to opt out of any class action which asserts

monetary claims on their behalf." Pet. for Cert. i.

II
That certified question is of no general consequence if,whether or not absent class members have a constitutional

right to opt out of such actions, they have a right to do sounder the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Such a right
would exist if, in actions seeking monetary damages, classescan be certified only under Rule 23(b)(3), which permits optout, and not under Rules 23(b)(1) and (b)(2), which do not.See Rules 23(c)(2) and (c)(3). That is at least a substantial
possibility--and we would normally resolve that preliminarynonconstitutional question before proceeding to the constitutional claim. See New York City Transit Authority v.
Beazer, 440 U. S. 568, 582-583 (1979). The law of res judi-cata, however, prevents that question from being litigated

here. It was conclusively determined in the MDL No. 633litigation that respondents' class fit within Rules 23(b)(1)(A)
and (b)(2); even though that determination may have beenwrong, it is conclusive upon these parties, and the alternative
of using the Federal Rules instead of the Constitution as themeans of imposing an opt-out requirement for this settlement is no longer available.The most obvious consequence of this unavailability is,
as we have suggested, that our resolution of the posited con-stitutional question may be quite unnecessary in law, and
of virtually no practical consequence in fact, except withrespect to these particular litigants. Another consequence,
less apparent, is that resolving the constitutional question onthe assumption of proper certification under the Rules may
lead us to the wrong result. If the Federal Rules, whichgenerally are not affirmatively enacted into law by Congress,
see 28 U. S. C. $$ 2072(a), (b), 2074(a), are not entitled to thatgreat deference as to constitutionality which we accord fed511us1$34z 06-11-96 17:19:05 PAGES OPINPGT

eral statutes, see, e. g., Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U. S. 57, 64(1981);

Walters v. National Assn. of Radiation Survivors,
473 U. S. 305, 319-320 (1985), they at least come with the
imprimatur of the rulemaking authority of this Court. In
deciding the present case, we must assume either that the
lack of opt-out opportunity in these circumstances was de-creed by the Rules or that it was not (though the parties

are bound by an erroneous holding that it was). If we makethe former assumption we may approve, in the mistaken
deference to prior Supreme Court action and congressionalacquiescence, action that neither we nor Congress would
independently think constitutional. If we make the latterassumption, we may announce a constitutional rule that is
good for no other federal class action. Neither option is
attractive.

The one reason to proceed is to achieve justice in this particular case. Even if the constitutional question presented
is hypothetical as to everyone else, it would seem to be of
great practical importance to these litigants. But that is
ordinarily not sufficient reason for our granting certiorari--
even when unnecessary constitutional pronouncements are
not in the picture. Moreover, as matters have developed it
is not clear that our resolution of the constitutional question
will make any difference even to these litigants. On the day
we granted certiorari we were informed that the parties had
reached a settlement designed to moot the petition, which
now awaits the approval of the District Court.

In these circumstances, we think it best to dismiss the writ
as improvidently granted.

Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.

We granted certiorari to consider one specific question:
"Whether a federal court may refuse to enforce a prior federal class action judgment, properly certified under Rule 23,
on grounds that absent class members have a constitutional

due process right to opt out of any class action which assertsmonetary claims on their behalf." Pet. for Cert. i. The

Court decides not to answer this question based on its specu-lation about a nonconstitutional ground for decision that is
neither presented on this record nor available to these parties. From that decision I respectfully dissent.Respondents are members of a class that reached a final

settlement with petitioners in an antitrust action styledMDL No. 633.

In re Real Estate Title and Settlement
Services Antitrust Litigation, 1986-1 Trade Cases || 67,149,p. 62,921 (ED Pa. 1986), aff 'd, 815 F. 2d 695 (CA3 1987), cert.

denied, 485 U. S. 909 (1988). Respondents subsequently
brought this action against petitioners, asserting some of the
same claims. The District Court held that respondents had
been adequately represented in the MDL No. 633 action, and
granted summary judgment for petitioners because, given
the identity of parties and claims, the MDL No. 633 settlement was res judicata. App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a-28a. The
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. 982 F. 2d
386 (1992). The court agreed that respondents had been adequately represented in the MDL No. 633 action, id., at 390-
391, but held that respondents could nevertheless relitigate
the same claims against petitioners: "Because [respondents]
had no opportunity to opt out of the MDL No. 633 litigation,
we hold there would be a violation of minimal due process if
[respondents'] damage claims were held barred by res judicata." Id., at 392.

The Court concludes that the correctness of the Ninth Circuit's constitutional interpretation "is of no general consequence if, . . . in actions seeking monetary damages, classes
can be certified only under Rule 23(b)(3), which permits optout, and not under Rules 23(b)(1) and (b)(2), which do not."
Ante, at 121. In other words, the Court declines to answer
the constitutional question because the MDL No. 633 action
might not have been properly certified--an issue that was
litigated to a final determination in petitioners' favor more

than five years ago, and on which we denied certiorari. Thenonconstitutional ground for decision about which the Court

speculates is therefore unavailable to respondents. The con-stitutional ground on which the Court of Appeals relied, the
one we granted certiorari to review and the parties have
briefed and argued, was necessary to the decision in thiscase. Our prudential rule of avoiding constitutional questions has no application in these circumstances, and theCourt errs in relying on it.

The Court's assertion that "our resolution of the positedconstitutional question may be . . . of virtually no practical
consequence in fact," ibid., is unsound. The lower courts
have consistently held that the presence of monetary damages claims does not preclude class certification under Rules
23(b)(1)(A) and (b)(2). See 7A C. Wright, A. Miller, &
M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure, Civil 2d $ 1775,
pp. 463-470 (1986 and Supp. 1992). Whether or not those
decisions are correct (a question we need not, and indeed
should not, decide today), they at least indicate that there
are a substantial number of class members in exactly the
same position as respondents. Under the Ninth Circuit's
rationale in this case, every one of them has the right to
go into federal court and relitigate their claims against the
defendants in the original action. The individuals, corporations, and governments that have successfully defended
against class actions or reached appropriate settlements, but
are now subject to relitigation of the same claims with
individual class members, will rightly dispute the Court's
characterization of the constitutional rule in this case as
inconsequential.

The Court is likewise incorrect in suggesting that a decision in this case "may be quite unnecessary in law." Ante,
at 121. Unless and until a contrary rule is adopted, courts
will continue to certify classes under Rules 23(b)(1) and (b)(2)
notwithstanding the presence of damages claims; the constitutional opt-out right announced by the court below will be

O'Connor, J., dissenting
implicated in every such action, at least in the Ninth Circuit.Moreover, because the decision below is based on the Due

Process Clause, presumably it applies to the States; althoughwe held in

Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U. S. 797
(1985), that there is a constitutional right to opt out of class
actions brought in state court, that holding was expressly"limited to those class actions which seek to bind known

plaintiffs concerning claims wholly or predominately formoney judgments."

Id., at 811, n. 3. The Ninth Circuit's
rule, by contrast, applies whenever "substantial damageclaims" are asserted. See 982 F. 2d, at 392. The resolution

of a constitutional issue with such broad-ranging consequences is both necessary and appropriate.

Finally, I do not agree with the Court's suggestion that
the posture of the case could "lead us to the wrong result"
with respect to the question whether the Due Process Clause
requires an opt-out right in federal class actions involving
claims for money damages. See ante, at 121-122. As the
case comes to us, we must assume that the MDL No. 633
class was properly certified under Rule 23, notwithstanding
the presence of claims for monetary relief. But this assumption, coupled with whatever presumption of constitutionality
to which the Rules are entitled, will not lead us to "approve
. . . action that neither we nor Congress would independently
think constitutional." Ante, at 122. Either an opt-out
right is constitutionally required, or it is not. We can decide
this issue while reserving the question of how the Rules
should be construed. While it might be convenient, and it
would certainly accord with our usual practice, to decide the
nonconstitutional question first, that option is not available
to us in this case. The only question, then, is whether we
should dismiss the writ as improvidently granted. In my
view, the importance of the constitutional question, as well
as the significant expenditures of resources by the litigants,
amici, and this Court, outweighs the prudential concerns on
which the Court relies.

Syllabus

J. E. B. v. ALABAMA ex rel. T. B.
certiorari to the court of civil appeals of alabama

No. 92-1239. Argued November 2, 1993--Decided April 19, 1994
At petitioner's paternity and child support trial, respondent State used

9 of its 10 peremptory challenges to remove male jurors. The court
empaneled an all-female jury after rejecting petitioner's claim that the
logic and reasoning of Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79--in which this
Court held that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits peremptory strikes based solely on race--extend to forbid gender-based peremptory challenges. The jury found petitioner to
be the father of the child in question and the trial court ordered him to
pay child support. The Alabama Court of Civil Appeals affirmed.

Held: The Equal Protection Clause prohibits discrimination in jury selection on the basis of gender, or on the assumption that an individual will
be biased in a particular case solely because that person happens to be
a woman or a man. Respondent's gender-based peremptory challenges
cannot survive the heightened equal protection scrutiny that this Court
affords distinctions based on gender. Respondent's rationale--that its
decision to strike virtually all males in this case may reasonably have
been based on the perception, supported by history, that men otherwise
totally qualified to serve as jurors might be more sympathetic and receptive to the arguments of a man charged in a paternity action, while
women equally qualified might be more sympathetic and receptive to
the arguments of the child's mother--is virtually unsupported and is
based on the very stereotypes the law condemns. The conclusion that
litigants may not strike potential jurors solely on the basis of gender
does not imply the elimination of all peremptory challenges. So long
as gender does not serve as a proxy for bias, unacceptable jurors may
still be removed, including those who are members of a group or class
that is normally subject to "rational basis" review and those who exhibit
characteristics that are disproportionately associated with one gender.

Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court.
In Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), this Court heldthat the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment governs the exercise of peremptory challenges by aprosecutor in a criminal trial. The Court explained that although a defendant has "no right to a `petit jury composedin whole or in part of persons of his own race,' " id., at 85,
quoting Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303, 305 (1880),the "defendant does have the right to be tried by a jury
whose members are selected pursuant to nondiscriminatorycriteria," 476 U. S., at 85-86. Since

Batson, we have reaf-firmed repeatedly our commitment to jury selection procedures that are fair and nondiscriminatory. We have recog-nized that whether the trial is criminal or civil, potential
jurors, as well as litigants, have an equal protection right tojury selection procedures that are free from state-sponsored
group stereotypes rooted in, and reflective of, historical prej-udice. See

Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400 (1991); Edmonsonv. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614 (1991); Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U. S. 42 (1992).Although premised on equal protection principles that
apply equally to gender discrimination, all our recent cases

Opinion of the Court
defining the scope of Batson involved alleged racial discrimi-nation in the exercise of peremptory challenges. Today we

are faced with the question whether the Equal ProtectionClause forbids intentional discrimination on the basis of gender, just as it prohibits discrimination on the basis of race.We hold that gender, like race, is an unconstitutional proxy
for juror competence and impartiality.

I
On behalf of relator T. B., the mother of a minor child,respondent State of Alabama filed a complaint for paternity

and child support against petitioner J. E. B. in the DistrictCourt of Jackson County, Alabama. On October 21, 1991,
the matter was called for trial and jury selection began.The trial court assembled a panel of 36 potential jurors, 12
males and 24 females. After the court excused three jurorsfor cause, only 10 of the remaining 33 jurors were male. The
State then used 9 of its 10 peremptory strikes to removemale jurors; petitioner used all but one of his strikes to remove female jurors. As a result, all the selected jurorswere female.

Before the jury was empaneled, petitioner objected to theState's peremptory challenges on the ground that they were
exercised against male jurors solely on the basis of gender,in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. App. 22. Petitioner argued that the logic andreasoning of Batson v. Kentucky, which prohibits peremptory strikes solely on the basis of race, similarly forbids in-tentional discrimination on the basis of gender. The court
rejected petitioner's claim and empaneled the all-female jury.App. 23. The jury found petitioner to be the father of the
child, and the court entered an order directing him to paychild support. On postjudgment motion, the court reaffirmed its ruling that Batson does not extend to gender-based peremptory challenges. App. 33. The Alabama

Opinion of the Court
the Equal Protection Clause, particularly where, as here, thediscrimination serves to ratify and perpetuate invidious, archaic, and overbroad stereotypes about the relative abilitiesof men and women.

II
Discrimination on the basis of gender in the exercise ofperemptory challenges is a relatively recent phenomenon.

Gender-based peremptory strikes were hardly practicableduring most of our country's existence, since, until the 20th
century, women were completely excluded from jury serv-ice.

2 So well entrenched was this exclusion of women that

in 1880 this Court, while finding that the exclusion ofAfrican-American men from juries violated the Fourteenth

Amendment, expressed no doubt that a State "may confinethe selection [of jurors] to males." Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S., at 310; see also Fay v. New York, 332 U. S.261, 289-290 (1947).

Many States continued to exclude women from jury serv-ice well into the present century, despite the fact that women
attained suffrage upon ratification of the Nineteenth Amend-ment in 1920.

3 States that did permit women to serve on

juries often erected other barriers, such as registration re-quirements and automatic exemptions, designed to deter

women from exercising their right to jury service. See, e. g.,

2 There was one brief exception. Between 1870 and 1871, women were
permitted to serve on juries in Wyoming Territory. They were no longer
allowed on juries after a new chief justice who disfavored the practice was
appointed in 1871. See Abrahamson, Justice and Juror, 20 Ga. L. Rev.
257, 263-264 (1986).

3 In 1947, women still had not been granted the right to serve on juries

in 16 States. See Rudolph, Women on Juries--Voluntary or Compulsory?,
44 J. Am. Jud. Soc. 206 (1961). As late as 1961, three States, Alabama,
Mississippi, and South Carolina, continued to exclude women from jury
service. See Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U. S. 57, 62 (1961). Indeed, Alabama
did not recognize women as a "cognizable group" for jury-service purposes
until after the 1966 decision in White v. Crook, 251 F. Supp. 401 (MD Ala.)
(three-judge court).

Opinion of the Court
Fay v. New York, 332 U. S., at 289 ("[I]n 15 of the 28 stateswhich permitted women to serve [on juries in 1942], they

might claim exemption because of their sex"); Hoyt v. Flor-ida, 368 U. S. 57 (1961) (upholding affirmative registration
statute that exempted women from mandatory jury service).The prohibition of women on juries was derived from the
English common law which, according to Blackstone, right-fully excluded women from juries under "the doctrine of
propter defectum sexus, literally, the `defect of sex.' "
United States v. De Gross, 960 F. 2d 1433, 1438 (CA9 1992)(en banc), quoting 2 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *362.

this country, supporters of the exclusion of women from ju-ries tended to couch their objections in terms of the ostensible need to protect women from the ugliness and depravityof trials. Women were thought to be too fragile and virginal
to withstand the polluted courtroom atmosphere. See Bailey v. State, 215 Ark. 53, 61, 219 S. W. 2d 424, 428 (1949)("Criminal court trials often involve testimony of the foulest

kind, and they sometimes require consideration of indecentconduct, the use of filthy and loathsome words, references to
intimate sex relationships, and other elements that wouldprove humiliating, embarrassing and degrading to a lady");

4 In England there was at least one deviation from the general rule that
only males could serve as jurors. If a woman was subject to capital punishment, or if a widow sought postponement of the disposition of her husband's estate until birth of a child, a writ de ventre inspiciendo permitted
the use of a jury of matrons to examine the woman to determine whether
she was pregnant. But even when a jury of matrons was used, the examination took place in the presence of 12 men, who also composed part of
the jury in such cases. The jury of matrons was used in the United States
during the Colonial period, but apparently fell into disuse when the medical profession began to perform that function. See Note, Jury Service for
Women, 12 U. Fla. L. Rev. 224, 224-225 (1959).

well as nature herself, has always recognized a wide differ-ence in the respective spheres and destinies of man and
woman. Man is, or should be, woman's protector and de-fender. The natural and proper timidity and delicacy which
belongs to the female sex evidently unfits it for many of theoccupations of civil life. . . . The paramount destiny and mission of woman are to fulfil the noble and benign offices ofwife and mother. This is the law of the Creator"). Cf.
Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677, 684 (1973) (pluralityopinion) (This "attitude of `romantic paternalism' . . . put
women, not on a pedestal, but in a cage").This Court in Ballard v. United States, 329 U. S. 187
(1946), first questioned the fundamental fairness of denyingwomen the right to serve on juries. Relying on its supervisory powers over the federal courts, it held that women maynot be excluded from the venire in federal trials in States
where women were eligible for jury service under local law.In response to the argument that women have no superior
or unique perspective, such that defendants are denied a fairtrial by virtue of their exclusion from jury panels, the
Court explained:

"It is said . . . that an all male panel drawn from thevarious groups within a community will be as truly representative as if women were included. The thought isthat the factors which tend to influence the action of
women are the same as those which influence the actionof men--personality, background, economic status--and
not sex. Yet it is not enough to say that women when
sitting as jurors neither act nor tend to act as a class.Men likewise do not act like a class. . . . The truth is

that the two sexes are not fungible; a community madeup exclusively of one is different from a community composed of both; the subtle interplay of influence one on

the other is among the imponderables. To insulate thecourtroom from either may not in a given case make an

iota of difference. Yet a flavor, a distinct quality is lostif either sex is excluded."

Id., at 193-194 (footnotes
omitted).

Fifteen years later, however, the Court still was unwilling
to translate its appreciation for the value of women's contribution to civic life into an enforceable right to equal treatment under state laws governing jury service. In Hoyt v.
Florida, 368 U. S., at 61, the Court found it reasonable, "[d]espite the enlightened emancipation of women," to exempt
women from mandatory jury service by statute, allowing
women to serve on juries only if they volunteered to serve.
The Court justified the differential exemption policy on the
ground that women, unlike men, occupied a unique position
"as the center of home and family life." Id., at 62.

In 1975, the Court finally repudiated the reasoning of Hoyt
and struck down, under the Sixth Amendment, an affirmative registration statute nearly identical to the one at issue
in Hoyt. See Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522 (1975).5
We explained: "Restricting jury service to only special
groups or excluding identifiable segments playing major
roles in the community cannot be squared with the constitutional concept of jury trial." Id., at 530. The diverse and
representative character of the jury must be maintained
" `partly as assurance of a diffused impartiality and partly
because sharing in the administration of justice is a phase
of civic responsibility.' " Id., at 530-531, quoting Thiel v.
Southern Pacific Co., 328 U. S. 217, 227 (1946) (Frankfurter,

5 Taylor distinguished Hoyt by explaining that that case "did not involve
a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury drawn from a fair cross
section of the community," 419 U. S., at 534. The Court now, however,
has stated that Taylor "in effect" overruled Hoyt. See Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828, n. 1 (1991).

Taylor relied on Sixth Amendment principles, but theopinion's approach is consistent with the heightened equal

protection scrutiny afforded gender-based classifications.Since

Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71 (1971), this Court consist-ently has subjected gender-based classifications to heightened scrutiny in recognition of the real danger that govern-ment policies that professedly are based on reasonable
considerations in fact may be reflective of "archaic and over-broad" generalizations about gender, see

Schlesinger v. Bal-lard, 419 U. S. 498, 506-507 (1975), or based on "outdated

misconceptions concerning the role of females in the homerather than in the `marketplace and world of ideas.' " Craig
v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 198-199 (1976). See also Cleburnev.

Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432, 441 (1985)(differential treatment of the sexes "very likely reflect[s]

outmoded notions of the relative capabilities of men andwomen").

Despite the heightened scrutiny afforded distinctionsbased on gender, respondent argues that gender discrimination in the selection of the petit jury should be permitted,though discrimination on the basis of race is not. Respondent suggests that "gender discrimination in this country . . .has never reached the level of discrimination" against
African-Americans, and therefore gender discrimination,
unlike racial discrimination, is tolerable in the courtroom.Brief for Respondent 9.

While the prejudicial attitudes toward women in this country have not been identical to those held toward racial minor-ities, the similarities between the experiences of racial minorities and women, in some contexts, "overpower thosedifferences." Note, Beyond

Opinion of the Court
(1992). As a plurality of this Court observed in Frontierov.

Richardson, 411 U. S., at 685:

"[T]hroughout much of the 19th century the position ofwomen in our society was, in many respects, comparable

to that of blacks under the pre-Civil War slave codes.Neither slaves nor women could hold office, serve on
juries, or bring suit in their own names, and marriedwomen traditionally were denied the legal capacity to
hold or convey property or to serve as legal guardiansof their own children. . . . And although blacks were
guaranteed the right to vote in 1870, women were
denied even that right--which is itself `preservativeof other basic civil and political rights'--until adoption

of the Nineteenth Amendment half a century later."(Footnote omitted.)

Certainly, with respect to jury service, African-Americansand women share a history of total exclusion, a history which
came to an end for women many years after the embarrassingchapter in our history came to an end for African-Americans.

We need not determine, however, whether women or racialminorities have suffered more at the hands of discriminatory
state actors during the decades of our Nation's history. Itis necessary only to acknowledge that "our Nation has had a
long and unfortunate history of sex discrimination," id., at
684, a history which warrants the heightened scrutiny weafford all gender-based classifications today. Under our

equal protection jurisprudence, gender-based classificationsrequire "an exceedingly persuasive justification" in order to
survive constitutional scrutiny. See Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256, 273 (1979). See also
Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 724
(1982); Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 450 U. S. 455, 461 (1981).

Thus, the only question is whether discrimination on the
basis of gender in jury selection substantially furthers the
State's legitimate interest in achieving a fair and impartial

trial.6 In making this assessment, we do not weigh the
value of peremptory challenges as an institution against our
asserted commitment to eradicate invidious discrimination
from the courtroom.7 Instead, we consider whether peremptory challenges based on gender stereotypes provide
substantial aid to a litigant's effort to secure a fair and impartial jury.8

Far from proffering an exceptionally persuasive justification for its gender-based peremptory challenges, respondent
maintains that its decision to strike virtually all the males
from the jury in this case "may reasonably have been based
upon the perception, supported by history, that men otherwise totally qualified to serve upon a jury in any case might

6 Because we conclude that gender-based peremptory challenges are not
substantially related to an important government objective, we once again
need not decide whether classifications based on gender are inherently
suspect. See Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U. S., at 724, n. 9; Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S. 7, 13 (1975); Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510
U. S. 17, 26, n. (1993) (Ginsburg, J., concurring) ("[I]t remains an open
question whether `classifications based on gender are inherently suspect' ")
(citations omitted).

7 Although peremptory challenges are valuable tools in jury trials, they

"are not constitutionally protected fundamental rights; rather they are but
one state-created means to the constitutional end of an impartial jury and
a fair trial." Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U. S. 42, 57 (1992).

8 Respondent argues that we should recognize a special state interest in

this case: the State's interest in establishing the paternity of a child born
out of wedlock. Respondent contends that this interest justifies the use
of gender-based peremptory challenges, since illegitimate children are
themselves victims of historical discrimination and entitled to heightened
scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.

What respondent fails to recognize is that the only legitimate interest
it could possibly have in the exercise of its peremptory challenges is securing a fair and impartial jury. See Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co.,
500 U. S. 614, 620 (1991) ("[The] sole purpose [of the peremptory challenge]
is to permit litigants to assist the government in the selection of an impartial trier of fact"). This interest does not change with the parties or the
causes. The State's interest in every trial is to see that the proceedings
are carried out in a fair, impartial, and nondiscriminatory manner.

We shall not accept as a defense to gender-based peremp-tory challenges "the very stereotype the law condemns."

Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S., at 410. Respondent's rationale,not unlike those regularly expressed for gender-based
strikes, is reminiscent of the arguments advanced to justifythe total exclusion of women from juries.

10 Respondent of9 Respondent cites one study in support of its quasi-empirical claim that
women and men may have different attitudes about certain issues justifying the use of gender as a proxy for bias. See R. Hastie, S. Penrod, &
N. Pennington, Inside the Jury 140 (1983). The authors conclude: "Neither student nor citizen judgments for typical criminal case materials have
revealed differences between male and female verdict preferences. . . .
The picture differs [only] for rape cases, where female jurors appear to
be somewhat more conviction-prone than male jurors." The majority of
studies suggest that gender plays no identifiable role in jurors' attitudes.
See, e. g., V. Hans & N. Vidmar, Judging the Jury 76 (1986) ("[I]n the
majority of studies there are no significant differences in the way men and
women perceive and react to trials; yet a few studies find women more
defense-oriented, while still others show women more favorable to the
prosecutor"). Even in 1956, before women had a constitutional right to
serve on juries, some commentators warned against using gender as a
proxy for bias. See F. Busch, Law and Tactics in Jury Trials $ 143, p. 207
(1949) ("In this age of general and specialized education, availed of generally by both men and women, it would appear unsound to base a peremptory challenge in any case upon the sole ground of sex . . .").

10 A manual formerly used to instruct prosecutors in Dallas, Texas, provided the following advice: " `I don't like women jurors because I can't
trust them. They do, however, make the best jurors in cases involving
crimes against children. It is possible that their "women's intuition" can
help you if you can't win your case with the facts.' " Alschuler, The Supreme Court and the Jury: Voir Dire, Peremptory Challenges, and the
Review of Jury Verdicts, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 153, 210 (1989). Another
widely circulated trial manual speculated:

"If counsel is depending upon a clearly applicable rule of law and if he
wants to avoid a verdict of `intuition' or `sympathy,' if his verdict in

Opinion of the Court
fers virtually no support for the conclusion that gender alone
is an accurate predictor of juror's attitudes; yet it urges this
Court to condone the same stereotypes that justified the
wholesale exclusion of women from juries and the ballot
box.11 Respondent seems to assume that gross generalizations that would be deemed impermissible if made on the

amount is to be proved by clearly demonstrated blackboard figures for
example, generally he would want a male juror.. . . . .

"[But] women . . . are desired jurors when plaintiff is a man. A woman
juror may see a man impeached from the beginning of the case to the end,
but there is at least the chance [with] the woman juror (particularly if the
man happens to be handsome or appealing) [that] the plaintiff's derelictions in and out of court will be overlooked. A woman is inclined to forgive sin in the opposite sex; but definitely not her own." 3 M. Belli, Modern Trials $$ 51.67 and 51.68, pp. 446-447 (2d ed. 1982).

11 Even if a measure of truth can be found in some of the gender stereotypes used to justify gender-based peremptory challenges, that fact alone
cannot support discrimination on the basis of gender in jury selection.
We have made abundantly clear in past cases that gender classifications
that rest on impermissible stereotypes violate the Equal Protection
Clause, even when some statistical support can be conjured up for the
generalization. See, e. g., Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636, 645
(1975) (holding unconstitutional a Social Security Act classification authorizing benefits to widows but not to widowers despite the fact that the
justification for the differential treatment was "not entirely without empirical support"); Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 201 (1976) (invalidating an
Oklahoma law that established different drinking ages for men and
women, although the evidence supporting the age differential was "not
trivial in a statistical sense"). The generalization advanced by Alabama
in support of its asserted right to discriminate on the basis of gender is,
at the least, overbroad, and serves only to perpetuate the same "outmoded
notions of the relative capabilities of men and women," Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432, 441 (1985), that we have invalidated in other contexts. See Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677
(1973); Stanton v. Stanton, supra; Craig v. Boren, supra; Mississippi
Univ. for Women v. Hogan, supra. The Equal Protection Clause, as interpreted by decisions of this Court, acknowledges that a shred of truth may
be contained in some stereotypes, but requires that state actors look beyond the surface before making judgments about people that are likely
to stigmatize as well as to perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination.

basis of race are somehow permissible when made on the
basis of gender.

Discrimination in jury selection, whether based on race or
on gender, causes harm to the litigants, the community, and
the individual jurors who are wrongfully excluded from participation in the judicial process. The litigants are harmed
by the risk that the prejudice that motivated the discriminatory selection of the jury will infect the entire proceedings.
See Edmonson, 500 U. S., at 628 (discrimination in the courtroom "raises serious questions as to the fairness of the proceedings conducted there"). The community is harmed by
the State's participation in the perpetuation of invidious
group stereotypes and the inevitable loss of confidence in our
judicial system that state-sanctioned discrimination in the
courtroom engenders.

When state actors exercise peremptory challenges in reliance on gender stereotypes, they ratify and reinforce prejudicial views of the relative abilities of men and women. Because these stereotypes have wreaked injustice in so many
other spheres of our country's public life, active discrimination by litigants on the basis of gender during jury selection
"invites cynicism respecting the jury's neutrality and its obligation to adhere to the law." Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S., at
412. The potential for cynicism is particularly acute in cases
where gender-related issues are prominent, such as cases involving rape, sexual harassment, or paternity. Discriminatory use of peremptory challenges may create the impression
that the judicial system has acquiesced in suppressing full
participation by one gender or that the "deck has been
stacked" in favor of one side. See id., at 413 ("The verdict
will not be accepted or understood [as fair] if the jury is chosen by unlawful means at the outset").

In recent cases we have emphasized that individual jurors
themselves have a right to nondiscriminatory jury selection

procedures.12 See Powers, supra, Edmonson, supra, and
Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U. S. 42 (1992). Contrary to respondent's suggestion, this right extends to both men andwomen. See

Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458
U. S, at 723 (that a state practice "discriminates against
males rather than against females does not exempt it from
scrutiny or reduce the standard of review"); cf. Brief for Respondent 9 (arguing that men deserve no protection from
gender discrimination in jury selection because they are not
victims of historical discrimination). All persons, when
granted the opportunity to serve on a jury, have the right
not to be excluded summarily because of discriminatory and
stereotypical presumptions that reflect and reinforce pat12 Given our recent precedent, the doctrinal basis for Justice Scalia's
dissenting opinion is a mystery. Justice Scalia points out that the discrimination at issue in this case was directed at men, rather than women,
but then acknowledges that the Equal Protection Clause protects both
men and women from intentional discrimination on the basis of gender.
See post, at 157, citing Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S.,
at 723-724. He also appears cognizant of the fact that classifications
based on gender must be more than merely rational, see post, at 160-161;
they must be supported by an "exceedingly persuasive justification,"
Hogan, 458 U. S., at 724. Justice Scalia further admits that the Equal
Protection Clause, as interpreted by decisions of this Court, governs the
exercise of peremptory challenges in every trial, and that potential jurors,
as well as litigants, have an equal protection right to nondiscriminatory
jury selection procedures. See post, at 158-160, citing Batson, Powers,
Edmonson, and McCollum. Justice Scalia does not suggest that we
overrule these cases, nor does he attempt to distinguish them. He intimates that discrimination on the basis of gender in jury selection may be
rational, see post, at 157, but offers no "exceedingly persuasive justification" for it. Indeed, Justice Scalia fails to advance any justification for
his apparent belief that the Equal Protection Clause, while prohibiting
discrimination on the basis of race in the exercise of peremptory challenges, allows discrimination on the basis of gender. His dissenting opinion thus serves as a tacit admission that, short of overruling a decade of
cases interpreting the Equal Protection Clause, the result we reach today
is doctrinally compelled.

terns of historical discrimination.13 Striking individualjurors on the assumption that they hold particular views

simply because of their gender is "practically a brand uponthem, affixed by the law, an assertion of their inferiority."
Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S., at 308. It denigratesthe dignity of the excluded juror, and, for a woman, reinvokes a history of exclusion from political participation.14The message it sends to all those in the courtroom, and all
those who may later learn of the discriminatory act, is thatcertain individuals, for no reason other than gender, are presumed unqualified by state actors to decide important ques-tions upon which reasonable persons could disagree.

15

13 It is irrelevant that women, unlike African-Americans, are not a numerical minority and therefore are likely to remain on the jury if each side
uses its peremptory challenges in an equally discriminatory fashion. Cf.
United States v. Broussard, 987 F. 2d, at 220 (declining to extend Batson
to gender; noting that "[w]omen are not a numerical minority," and therefore are likely to be represented on juries despite the discriminatory use
of peremptory challenges). Because the right to nondiscriminatory jury
selection procedures belongs to the potential jurors, as well as to the litigants, the possibility that members of both genders will get on the jury
despite the intentional discrimination is beside the point. The exclusion
of even one juror for impermissible reasons harms that juror and undermines public confidence in the fairness of the system.

14 The popular refrain is that all peremptory challenges are based on

stereotypes of some kind, expressing various intuitive and frequently erroneous biases. See post, at 161. But where peremptory challenges are
made on the basis of group characteristics other than race or gender (like
occupation, for example), they do not reinforce the same stereotypes about
the group's competence or predispositions that have been used to prevent
them from voting, participating on juries, pursuing their chosen professions, or otherwise contributing to civic life. See Babcock, A Place in the
Palladium, Women's Rights and Jury Service, 61 U. Cinn. L. Rev. 1139,
1173 (1993).

15 Justice Scalia argues that there is no "discrimination and dishonor"

in being subject to a race- or gender-based peremptory strike. Post, at
160. Justice Scalia's argument has been rejected many times, see, e. g.,
Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, 410 (1991), and we reject it once again. The
only support Justice Scalia offers for his conclusion is the fact that raceand gender-based peremptory challenges have a long history in this coun511us1$35F 11-08-97 19:55:03 PAGES OPINPGT

IV
Our conclusion that litigants may not strike potential ju-rors solely on the basis of gender does not imply the elimination of all peremptory challenges. Neither does it conflictwith a State's legitimate interest in using such challenges in
its effort to secure a fair and impartial jury. Parties stillmay remove jurors who they feel might be less acceptable
than others on the panel; gender simply may not serve as aproxy for bias. Parties may also exercise their peremptory
challenges to remove from the venire any group or class ofindividuals normally subject to "rational basis" review. See
Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S., at 439-442; Clark v. Jeter, 486 U. S. 456, 461 (1988). Even strikes
based on characteristics that are disproportionately associ-ated with one gender could be appropriate, absent a showing
of pretext.16If conducted properly, voir dire can inform litigants about
potential jurors, making reliance upon stereotypical and pej-orative notions about a particular gender or race both unnecessary and unwise. Voir dire provides a means of discover-ing actual or implied bias and a firmer basis upon which the

try. Post, at 159 (discriminatory peremptory challenges have "coexisted
with the Equal Protection Clause for 120 years"); post, at 160 (there was
a "106-year interlude between our holding that exclusion from juries on
the basis of race was unconstitutional, [Strauder], and our holding that
peremptory challenges on the basis of race were unconstitutional, [Batson]"). We do not dispute that this Court long has tolerated the discriminatory use of peremptory challenges, but this is not a reason to continue
to do so. Many of "our people's traditions," see post, at 163, such as de
jure segregation and the total exclusion of women from juries, are now
unconstitutional even though they once coexisted with the Equal Protection Clause.

16 For example, challenging all persons who have had military experience would disproportionately affect men at this time, while challenging
all persons employed as nurses would disproportionately affect women.
Without a showing of pretext, however, these challenges may well not be
unconstitutional, since they are not gender or race based. See Hernandez
v. New York, 500 U. S. 352 (1991).

parties may exercise their peremptory challenges intelli-gently. See, e. g., Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U. S.

539, 602 (1976) (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (voirdire "facilitate[s] intelligent exercise of peremptory challenges and [helps] uncover factors that would dictate disqual-ification for cause");

United States v. Witt, 718 F. 2d 1494,1497 (CA10 1983) ("Without an adequate foundation [laid by

voir dire], counsel cannot exercise sensitive and intelligentperemptory challenges").

The experience in the many jurisdictions that have barredgender-based challenges belies the claim that litigants and
trial courts are incapable of complying with a rule barringstrikes based on gender. See n. 1,

supra (citing state andfederal jurisdictions that have extended Batson to gender).

17

As with race-based Batson claims, a party alleging genderdiscrimination must make a prima facie showing of inten17 Respondent argues that Alabama's method of jury selection would
make the extension of Batson to gender particularly burdensome. In Alabama, the "struck-jury" system is employed, a system which requires
litigants to strike alternately until 12 persons remain, who then constitute
the jury. See Ala. Rule Civ. Proc. 47 (1990). Respondent suggests that,
in some cases at least, it is necessary under this system to continue striking persons from the venire after the litigants no longer have an articulable reason for doing so. As a result, respondent contends, some litigants
may be unable to come up with gender-neutral explanations for their
strikes.

We find it worthy of note that Alabama has managed to maintain its
struck-jury system even after the ruling in Batson, despite the fact that
there are counties in Alabama that are predominately African-American.
In those counties, it presumably would be as difficult to come up with
race-neutral explanations for peremptory strikes as it would be to advance
gender-neutral explanations. No doubt the voir dire process aids litigants
in their ability to articulate race-neutral explanations for their peremptory
challenges. The same should be true for gender. Regardless, a State's
choice of jury-selection methods cannot insulate it from the strictures
of the Equal Protection Clause. Alabama is free to adopt whatever
jury-selection procedures it chooses so long as they do not violate the
Constitution.

476 U. S., at 97. When an explanation is required, it neednot rise to the level of a "for cause" challenge; rather, it
merely must be based on a juror characteristic other thangender, and the proffered explanation may not be pretextual.
See Hernandez v. New York, 500 U. S. 352 (1991).Failing to provide jurors the same protection against gender discrimination as race discrimination could frustrate thepurpose of

Batson itself. Because gender and race are over-lapping categories, gender can be used as a pretext for racial

discrimination.18 Allowing parties to remove racial minori-ties from the jury not because of their race, but because of
their gender, contravenes well-established equal protectionprinciples and could insulate effectively racial discrimination
from judicial scrutiny. V

18 The temptation to use gender as a pretext for racial discrimination
may explain why the majority of the lower court decisions extending Batson to gender involve the use of peremptory challenges to remove minority women. All four of the gender-based peremptory cases to reach the
Federal Courts of Appeals and cited in n. 1, supra, involved the striking
of minority women.

19 This Court almost a half century ago stated:

"The American tradition of trial by jury, considered in connection with
either criminal or civil proceedings, necessarily contemplates an impartial
jury drawn from a cross-section of the community. . . . This does not mean,
of course, that every jury must contain representatives of all the economic,
social, religious, racial, political and geographical groups of the community;
frequently such complete representation would be impossible. But it does
mean that prospective jurors shall be selected by court officials without
systematic and intentional exclusion of any of these groups. Recognition
must be given to the fact that those eligible for jury service are to be
found in every stratum of society. Jury competence is an individual
rather than a group or class matter. That fact lies at the very heart of

only furthers the goals of the jury system. It reaffirms thepromise of equality under the law--that all citizens, regardless of race, ethnicity, or gender, have the chance to take partdirectly in our democracy. Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S., at 407
("Indeed, with the exception of voting, for most citizens thehonor and privilege of jury duty is their most significant opportunity to participate in the democratic process"). Whenpersons are excluded from participation in our democratic
processes solely because of race or gender, this promise ofequality dims, and the integrity of our judicial system is
jeopardized.In view of these concerns, the Equal Protection Clause
prohibits discrimination in jury selection on the basis of gen-der, or on the assumption that an individual will be biased
in a particular case for no reason other than the fact that theperson happens to be a woman or happens to be a man. As
with race, the "core guarantee of equal protection, ensuringcitizens that their State will not discriminate . . . , would be
meaningless were we to approve the exclusion of jurors onthe basis of such assumptions, which arise solely from the
jurors' [gender]." Batson, 476 U. S., at 97-98.The judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals of Alabama is
reversed, and the case is remanded to that court for furtherproceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor, concurring.
I agree with the Court that the Equal Protection Clauseprohibits the government from excluding a person from jury

service on account of that person's gender. Ante, at 135-137. The State's proffered justifications for its genderbased peremptory challenges are far from the " `exceedinglypersuasive' " showing required to sustain a gender-based

and discriminations which are abhorrent to the democratic ideals of trial

ante, at 137-140. I therefore join the
Court's opinion in this case. But today's important blowagainst gender discrimination is not costless. I write separately to discuss some of these costs, and to express my belief that today's holding should be limited to the government's use of gender-based peremptory strikes.

Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), itself was a sig-nificant intrusion into the jury selection process.

Batson
minihearings are now routine in state and federal trialcourts, and

Batson appeals have proliferated as well. Demographics indicate that today's holding may have an even
greater impact than did Batson itself. In further constitutionalizing jury selection procedures, the Court increases the
number of cases in which jury selection--once a sideshow--
will become part of the main event.

For this same reason, today's decision further erodes the
role of the peremptory challenge. The peremptory challenge is "a practice of ancient origin" and is "part of our common law heritage." Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co.,
500 U. S. 614, 639 (1991) (O'Connor, J., dissenting). The
principal value of the peremptory is that it helps produce
fair and impartial juries. Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202,
218-219 (1965); Babcock, Voir Dire: Preserving "Its Wonderful Power," 27 Stan. L. Rev. 545, 549-558 (1975). "Peremptory challenges, by enabling each side to exclude those jurors
it believes will be most partial toward the other side, are a
means of eliminat[ing] extremes of partiality on both sides,
thereby assuring the selection of a qualified and unbiased
jury." Holland v. Illinois, 493 U. S. 474, 484 (1990) (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
The peremptory's importance is confirmed by its persistence:
It was well established at the time of Blackstone and continues to endure in all the States. Id., at 481.

Moreover, "[t]he essential nature of the peremptory challenge is that it is one exercised without a reason stated, with511us1$35J 11-08-97 19:55:03 PAGES OPINPGT

O'Connor, J., concurring
out inquiry and without being subject to the court's control."
Swain, 380 U. S., at 220. Indeed, often a reason for it cannot
be stated, for a trial lawyer's judgments about a juror's sym-pathies are sometimes based on experienced hunches and educated guesses, derived from a juror's responses at voir dire
or a juror's " `bare looks and gestures.' " Ibid. That a triallawyer's instinctive assessment of a juror's predisposition

cannot meet the high standards of a challenge for cause doesnot mean that the lawyer's instinct is erroneous. Cf. V.
Starr & M. McCormick, Jury Selection 522 (1993) (nonverbalcues can be better than verbal responses at revealing a juror's disposition). Our belief that experienced lawyers will
often correctly intuit which jurors are likely to be the least
sympathetic, and our understanding that the lawyer will
often be unable to explain the intuition, are the very reason
we cherish the peremptory challenge. But, as we add, layer
by layer, additional constitutional restraints on the use of the
peremptory, we force lawyers to articulate what we know is
often inarticulable.

In so doing we make the peremptory challenge less discretionary and more like a challenge for cause. We also increase the possibility that biased jurors will be allowed onto
the jury, because sometimes a lawyer will be unable to provide an acceptable gender-neutral explanation even though
the lawyer is in fact correct that the juror is unsympathetic.
Similarly, in jurisdictions where lawyers exercise their
strikes in open court, lawyers may be deterred from using
their peremptories, out of the fear that if they are unable to
justify the strike the court will seat a juror who knows that
the striking party thought him unfit. Because I believe the
peremptory remains an important litigator's tool and a fundamental part of the process of selecting impartial juries,
our increasing limitation of it gives me pause.

Nor is the value of the peremptory challenge to the litigant
diminished when the peremptory is exercised in a genderbased manner. We know that like race, gender matters. A

plethora of studies make clear that in rape cases, for ex-ample, female jurors are somewhat more likely to vote

to convict than male jurors. See R. Hastie, S. Penrod, &N. Pennington, Inside the Jury 140-141 (1983) (collecting and summarizing empirical studies). Moreover, though
there have been no similarly definitive studies regarding, forexample, sexual harassment, child custody, or spousal or

child abuse, one need not be a sexist to share the intuitionthat in certain cases a person's gender and resulting life
experience will be relevant to his or her view of the case." `Jurors are not expected to come into the jury box and leave
behind all that their human experience has taught them.' "
Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625, 642 (1980). Individuals are
not expected to ignore as jurors what they know as men--
or women.

Today's decision severely limits a litigant's ability to act
on this intuition, for the import of our holding is that any
correlation between a juror's gender and attitudes is irrelevant as a matter of constitutional law. But to say that gender makes no difference as a matter of law is not to say that
gender makes no difference as a matter of fact. I previously
have said with regard to Batson: "That the Court will not
tolerate prosecutors' racially discriminatory use of the peremptory challenge, in effect, is a special rule of relevance, a
statement about what this Nation stands for, rather than a
statement of fact." Brown v. North Carolina, 479 U. S. 940,
941-942 (1986) (opinion concurring in denial of certiorari).
Today's decision is a statement that, in an effort to eliminate
the potential discriminatory use of the peremptory, see
Batson, 476 U. S., at 102 (Marshall, J., concurring), gender is
now governed by the special rule of relevance formerly reserved for race. Though we gain much from this statement,
we cannot ignore what we lose. In extending Batson to
gender we have added an additional burden to the state
and federal trial process, taken a step closer to eliminating
the peremptory challenge, and diminished the ability of liti511us1$35J 11-08-97 19:55:03 PAGES OPINPGT

gants to act on sometimes accurate gender-based assump-tions about juror attitudes.

These concerns reinforce my conviction that today's deci-sion should be limited to a prohibition on the government's
use of gender-based peremptory challenges. The Equal
Protection Clause prohibits only discrimination by stateactors. In

Edmonson, supra, we made the mistake of concluding that private civil litigants were state actors whenthey exercised peremptory challenges; in

Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U. S. 42, 50-55 (1992), we compounded the mistakeby holding that criminal defendants were also state actors.

Our commitment to eliminating discrimination from the legal
process should not allow us to forget that not all that occurs
in the courtroom is state action. Private civil litigants are
just that--private litigants. "The government erects the
platform; it does not thereby become responsible for all that
occurs upon it." Edmonson, 500 U. S., at 632 (O'Connor,
J., dissenting).

Clearly, criminal defendants are not state actors. "From
arrest, to trial, to possible sentencing and punishment, the
antagonistic relationship between government and the accused is clear for all to see. . . . [T]he unique relationship
between criminal defendants and the State precludes attributing defendants' actions to the State . . . ." McCollum,
supra, at 67 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). The peremptory
challenge is " `one of the most important of the rights secured
to the accused.' " Swain, 380 U. S., at 219 (emphasis added);
Goldwasser, Limiting a Criminal Defendant's Use of Peremptory Challenges: On Symmetry and the Jury in a Criminal
Trial, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 808, 826-833 (1989). Limiting the
accused's use of the peremptory is "a serious misordering of
our priorities," for it means "we have exalted the right of
citizens to sit on juries over the rights of the criminal defendant, even though it is the defendant, not the jurors, who faces
imprisonment or even death." McCollum, supra, at 61-62
(Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
Accordingly, I adhere to my position that the Equal Pro-tection Clause does not limit the exercise of peremptory

challenges by private civil litigants and criminal defendants.This case itself presents no state action dilemma, for here
the State of Alabama itself filed the paternity suit on behalf
of petitioner. But what of the next case? Will we, in thename of fighting gender discrimination, hold that the battered wife--on trial for wounding her abusive husband--is astate actor? Will we preclude her from using her peremptory challenges to ensure that the jury of her peers containsas many women members as possible? I assume we will,
but I hope we will not.

Justice Kennedy, concurring in the judgment.
I am in full agreement with the Court that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits gender discrimination in the exercise of peremptory challenges. I write to explain my understanding of why our precedents lead to that conclusion.

Though in some initial drafts the Fourteenth Amendment
was written to prohibit discrimination against "persons because of race, color or previous condition of servitude," the
Amendment submitted for consideration and later ratified
contained more comprehensive terms: "No State shall . . .
deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." See Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S. 112,
172-173 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting
in part); B. Kendrick, Journal of the Joint Committee of Fifteen on Reconstruction, 39th Congress, 1865-1867, pp. 90-91,
97-100 (1914). In recognition of the evident historical fact
that the Equal Protection Clause was adopted to prohibit
government discrimination on the basis of race, the Court
most often interpreted it in the decades that followed in accord with that purpose. In Strauder v. West Virginia, 100
U. S. 303 (1880), for example, the Court invalidated a West
Virginia law prohibiting blacks from serving on juries. In
so doing, the decision said of the Equal Protection Clause:

152 J. E. B. v. ALABAMA ex rel. T. B.

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
"What is this but declaring that the law in the States shallbe the same for the black as for the white."

Id., at 307.
And while the Court held that the State could not confinejury service to whites, it further noted that the State could

confine jury service "to males, to freeholders, to citizens, to
persons within certain ages, or to persons having educationalqualifications."

Id., at 310. See also Yick Wo v. Hopkins,
118 U. S. 356, 373-374 (1886).As illustrated by the necessity for the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, much time passed before the Equal ProtectionClause was thought to reach beyond the purpose of prohibiting racial discrimination and to apply as well to discrimination based on sex. In over 20 cases beginning in 1971, however, we have subjected government classifications based on
sex to heightened scrutiny. Neither the State nor any Member of the Court questions that principle here. And though
the intermediate scrutiny test we have applied may not provide a very clear standard in all instances, see Craig v.
Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 221 (1976) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting),
our case law does reveal a strong presumption that gender
classifications are invalid. See, e. g., Mississippi Univ. for
Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718 (1982).

There is no doubt under our precedents, therefore, that
the Equal Protection Clause prohibits sex discrimination in
the selection of jurors. Duren v. Missouri, 439 U. S. 357
(1979); Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522 (1975). The only
question is whether the Clause also prohibits peremptory
challenges based on sex. The Court is correct to hold that
it does. The Equal Protection Clause and our constitutional
tradition are based on the theory that an individual possesses rights that are protected against lawless action by the
government. The neutral phrasing of the Equal Protection
Clause, extending its guarantee to "any person," reveals its
concern with rights of individuals, not groups (though group
disabilities are sometimes the mechanism by which the State
violates the individual right in question). "At the heart of

the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection lies the sim-ple command that the Government must treat citizens as individuals, not as simply components of a racial [or] sexual . . .class."

Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 602
(1990) (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (emphasis deleted; internal
quotation marks omitted). For purposes of the Equal Pro-tection Clause, an individual denied jury service because of

a peremptory challenge exercised against her on account ofher sex is no less injured than the individual denied jury
service because of a law banning members of her sex fromserving as jurors. Cf.,

e. g., Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400,
409-410 (1991); Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U. S. 429, 431-432
(1984); Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 346-347 (1880).
The injury is to personal dignity and to the individual's right
to participate in the political process. Powers, supra, at 410.
The neutrality of the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee is
confirmed by the fact that the Court has no difficulty in finding a constitutional wrong in this case, which involves males
excluded from jury service because of their gender.

The importance of individual rights to our analysis
prompts a further observation concerning what I conceive
to be the intended effect of today's decision. We do not prohibit racial and gender bias in jury selection only to encourage it in jury deliberations. Once seated, a juror should not
give free rein to some racial or gender bias of his or her own.
The jury system is a kind of compact by which power is
transferred from the judge to jury, the jury in turn deciding
the case in accord with the instructions defining the relevant
issues for consideration. The wise limitation on the authority of courts to inquire into the reasons underlying a jury's
verdict does not mean that a jury ought to disregard the
court's instructions. A juror who allows racial or gender
bias to influence assessment of the case breaches the compact
and renounces his or her oath.

In this regard, it is important to recognize that a juror sits
not as a representative of a racial or sexual group but as an

individual citizen. Nothing would be more pernicious to thejury system than for society to presume that persons of different backgrounds go to the jury room to voice prejudice.Cf. Metro Broadcasting, supra, at 618 (

O'Connor, J., dis-senting). The jury pool must be representative of the community, but that is a structural mechanism for preventingbias, not enfranchising it. See, e. g., Ballard v. United
States, 329 U. S. 187, 193 (1946); Thiel v. Southern PacificCo., 328 U. S. 217 (1946). "Jury competence is an individual
rather than a group or class matter. That fact lies at thevery heart of the jury system." Id., at 220. Thus, the Constitution guarantees a right only to an impartial jury, not toa jury composed of members of a particular race or gender.
See Holland v. Illinois, 493 U. S. 474 (1990); Strauder, 100U. S., at 305.

* * *
For these reasons, I concur in the judgment of the Courtholding that peremptory strikes based on gender violate the

Equal Protection Clause.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, dissenting.
I agree with the dissent of Justice Scalia, which I havejoined. I add these words in support of its conclusion. Accepting Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), as correctlydecided, there are sufficient differences between race and
gender discrimination such that the principle of Batsonshould not be extended to peremptory challenges to potential
jurors based on sex.That race and sex discrimination are different is acknowledged by our equal protection jurisprudence, which accordsdifferent levels of protection to the two groups. Classifications based on race are inherently suspect, triggering "strictscrutiny," while gender-based classifications are judged
under a heightened, but less searching, standard of review.

society, warranting in some situations a greater need forprotection, whereas the population is divided almost equally

between men and women. Furthermore, while substantialdiscrimination against both groups still lingers in our society,
racial equality has proved a more challenging goal to achieveon many fronts than gender equality. See,

e. g., D. Kirp,M. Yudof, & M. Franks, Gender Justice 137 (1986).

Batson, which involved a black defendant challenging theremoval of black jurors, announced a sea change in the jury
selection process. In balancing the dictates of equal protec-tion and the historical practice of peremptory challenges,
long recognized as securing fairness in trials, the Court
concluded that the command of the Equal Protection Clausewas superior. But the Court was careful that its rule not

"undermine the contribution the challenge generally makesto the administration of justice." 476 U. S., at 98-99.

Batson is best understood as a recognition that race lies at thecore of the commands of the Fourteenth Amendment. Not

surprisingly, all of our post-Batson cases have dealt withthe use of peremptory strikes to remove black or racially
identified venirepersons, and all have described Batson as
fashioning a rule aimed at preventing purposeful discrimina-tion against a cognizable racial group.* As

Justice O'Connor once recognized, Batson does not apply "[o]utside theuniquely sensitive area of race."

Brown v. North Carolina,
479 U. S. 940, 942 (1986) (opinion concurring in denial ofcertiorari).

Under the Equal Protection Clause, these differencesmean that the balance should tilt in favor of peremptory
challenges when sex, not race, is the issue. Unlike the

Court, I think the State has shown that jury strikes on thebasis of gender "substantially further" the State's legitimate

interest in achieving a fair and impartial trial through thevenerable practice of peremptory challenges.

Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202, 212-220 (1965) (tracing the "very old
credentials" of peremptory challenges); Batson, supra, at118-120 (Burger, C. J., dissenting);

post, at 161-162 (Scalia,
J., dissenting). The two sexes differ, both biologically and,to a diminishing extent, in experience. It is not merely

"stereotyping" to say that these differences may produce adifference in outlook which is brought to the jury room. Accordingly, use of peremptory challenges on the basis of sex isgenerally not the sort of derogatory and invidious act which
peremptory challenges directed at black jurors may be.

Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion recognizes several of the costs associated with extending Batson to genderbased peremptory challenges--lengthier trials, an increase
in the number and complexity of appeals addressing jury selection, and a "diminished . . . ability of litigants to act on
sometimes accurate gender-based assumptions about juror
attitudes." Ante, at 149-150. These costs are, in my view,
needlessly imposed by the Court's opinion, because the Constitution simply does not require the result that it reaches.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

Today's opinion is an inspiring demonstration of how thoroughly up-to-date and right-thinking we Justices are in matters pertaining to the sexes (or as the Court would have
it, the genders), and how sternly we disapprove the male
chauvinist attitudes of our predecessors. The price to be
paid for this display--a modest price, surely--is that most of
the opinion is quite irrelevant to the case at hand. The
hasty reader will be surprised to learn, for example, that this
lawsuit involves a complaint about the use of peremptory
challenges to exclude men from a petit jury. To be sure,

petitioner, a man, used all but one of his peremptory strikesto remove women from the jury (he used his last challenge

to strike the sole remaining male from the pool), but thevalidity of his strikes is not before us. Nonetheless, the
Court treats itself to an extended discussion of the historicexclusion of women not only from jury service, but also from
service at the bar (which is rather like jury service, in thatit involves going to the courthouse a lot). See

ante, at 131-136. All this, as I say, is irrelevant, since the case involves

state action that allegedly discriminates against men. Theparties do not contest that discrimination on the basis of sex

men rather than women, see, e. g., Mississippi Univ. forWomen v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 723-724 (1982)) is all that
was needed.The Court also spends time establishing that the use of
sex as a proxy for particular views or sympathies is unwiseand perhaps irrational. The opinion stresses the lack of statistical evidence to support the widely held belief that, atleast in certain types of cases, a juror's sex has some statistically significant predictive value as to how the juror will be-have. See

ante, at 137-139, and n. 9. This assertion seemsto place the Court in opposition to its earlier Sixth Amendment "fair cross-section" cases. See, e. g., Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.

1 Throughout this opinion, I shall refer to the issue as sex discrimination
rather than (as the Court does) gender discrimination. The word "gender" has acquired the new and useful connotation of cultural or attitudinal
characteristics (as opposed to physical characteristics) distinctive to the
sexes. That is to say, gender is to sex as feminine is to female and masculine to male. The present case does not involve peremptory strikes exercised on the basis of femininity or masculinity (as far as it appears, effeminate men did not survive the prosecution's peremptories). The case
involves, therefore, sex discrimination plain and simple.

and result"). But times and trends do change, and unisex isunquestionably in fashion. Personally, I am less inclined to

demand statistics, and more inclined to credit the percep-tions of experienced litigators who have had money on the
line. But it does not matter. The Court's fervent defenseof the proposition

il n'y a pas de diffe'rence entre les hommeset les femmes (it stereotypes the opposite view as hateful

"stereotyping") turns out to be, like its recounting of thehistory of sex discrimination against women, utterly irrelevant. Even if sex was a remarkably good predictor in cer-tain cases, the Court would find its use in peremptories unconstitutional. See ante, at 139, n. 11; cf. ante, at 148-149
(O'Connor, J., concurring).Of course the relationship of sex to partiality

would have
been relevant if the Court had demanded in this case what itordinarily demands: that the complaining party have suffered some injury. Leaving aside for the moment the real-ity that the defendant himself had the opportunity to strike
women from the jury, the defendant would have some causeto complain about the prosecutor's striking male jurors if
male jurors tend to be more favorable toward defendants in
paternity suits. But if men and women jurors are (as theCourt thinks) fungible, then the only arguable injury from

the prosecutor's "impermissible" use of male sex as the basisfor his peremptories is injury to the stricken juror, not to
the defendant. Indeed, far from having suffered harm, peti-tioner, a state actor under our precedents, see

Georgia v.
McCollum, 505 U. S. 42, 50-51 (1992); cf. Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614, 626-627 (1991), has himself
actually inflicted harm on female jurors.2 The Court today

2 I continue to agree with Justice O'Connor that McCollum and Edmondson erred in making civil litigants and criminal defendants state
actors for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause. I do not, however,
share her belief that correcting that error while continuing to consider the
exercise of peremptories by prosecutors a denial of equal protection will
make things right. If, in accordance with common perception but con511us1$35K 11-08-97 19:55:03 PAGES OPINPGT

presumably supplies petitioner with a cause of action byapplying the uniquely expansive third-party standing analysis of Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, 415 (1991), accordingpetitioner a remedy because of the wrong done to male jurors. This case illustrates why making restitution to Paulwhen it is Peter who has been robbed is such a bad idea.
Not only has petitioner, by implication of the Court's ownreasoning, suffered no harm, but the scientific evidence presented at trial established petitioner's paternity with 99.92%accuracy. Insofar as petitioner is concerned, this is a case
of harmless error if there ever was one; a retrial will donothing but divert the State's judicial and prosecutorial resources, allowing either petitioner or some other malefactorto go free.

The core of the Court's reasoning is that peremptory chal-lenges on the basis of any group characteristic subject to
heightened scrutiny are inconsistent with the guarantee ofthe Equal Protection Clause. That conclusion can be
reached only by focusing unrealistically upon individualexercises of the peremptory challenge, and ignoring the totality of the practice. Since all groups are subject to theperemptory challenge (and will be made the object of it,
depending upon the nature of the particular case) it is hardto see how any group is denied equal protection. See

id., at423-424 (
Scalia, J., dissenting); Batson v. Kentucky, 476U. S. 79, 137-138 (1986) (

Rehnquist, J., dissenting). Thatexplains why peremptory challenges coexisted with the

Equal Protection Clause for 120 years. This case is a per-fect example of how the system as a whole is evenhanded.
While the only claim before the Court is petitioner's com-plaint that the prosecutor struck male jurors, for every man

trary to the Court's unisex creed, women really will decide some cases
differently from men, allowing defendants alone to strike jurors on the
basis of sex will produce--and will be seen to produce--juries intentionally weighted in the defendant's favor: no women jurors, for example, in a
rape prosecution. That is not a desirable outcome.

Scalia, J., dissenting
struck by the government petitioner's own lawyer struck awoman. To say that men were singled out for discriminatory treatment in this process is preposterous. The situa-tion would be different if both sides systematically struck
individuals of one group, so that the strikes evinced groupbased animus and served as a proxy for segregated venirelists. See

Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202, 223-224 (1965).
The pattern here, however, displays not a systemic sex-basedanimus but each side's desire to get a jury favorably disposed

to its case. That is why the Court's characterization of re-spondent's argument as "reminiscent of the arguments advanced to justify the total exclusion of women from juries,"
ante, at 138, is patently false. Women were categorically
excluded from juries because of doubt that they were competent; women are stricken from juries by peremptory challenge because of doubt that they are well disposed to the
striking party's case. See Powers, supra, at 424 (Scalia,
J., dissenting). There is discrimination and dishonor in the
former, and not in the latter--which explains the 106-year
interlude between our holding that exclusion from juries on
the basis of race was unconstitutional, Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303 (1880), and our holding that peremptory
challenges on the basis of race were unconstitutional, Batson
v. Kentucky, supra.

Although the Court's legal reasoning in this case is largely
obscured by anti-male-chauvinist oratory, to the extent such
reasoning is discernible it invalidates much more than sexbased strikes. After identifying unequal treatment (by separating individual exercises of peremptory challenge from
the process as a whole), the Court applies the "heightened
scrutiny" mode of equal protection analysis used for sexbased discrimination, and concludes that the strikes fail
heightened scrutiny because they do not substantially further an important government interest. The Court says
that the only important government interest that could be
served by peremptory strikes is "securing a fair and impar511us1$35K 11-08-97 19:55:03 PAGES OPINPGT

tial jury," ante, at 137, and n. 8.3 It refuses to accept re-spondent's argument that these strikes further that interest

by eliminating a group (men) which may be partial to maledefendants, because it will not accept any argument based
on " `the very stereotype the law condemns.' " Ante, at 138
(quoting Powers, 499 U. S., at 410). This analysis, entirelyeliminating the only allowable argument, implies that sexbased strikes do not even rationally further a legitimate gov-ernment interest, let alone pass heightened scrutiny. That
places all peremptory strikes based on any group character-istic at risk, since they can all be denominated "stereotypes."
Perhaps, however (though I do not see why it should be so),only the stereotyping of groups entitled to heightened or
strict scrutiny constitutes "the very stereotype the law condemns"--so that other stereotyping (e. g., wide-eyed blondesand football players are dumb) remains OK. Or perhaps

when the Court refers to "impermissible stereotypes," ante,
at 139, n. 11, it means the adjective to be limiting rather than
descriptive--so that we can expect to learn from the Court's
peremptory/stereotyping jurisprudence in the future which
stereotypes the Constitution frowns upon and which it does
not.

Even if the line of our later cases guaranteed by today's
decision limits the theoretically boundless Batson principle
to race, sex, and perhaps other classifications subject to
heightened scrutiny (which presumably would include religious belief, see Larson v. Valente, 456 U. S. 228, 244-246
(1982)), much damage has been done. It has been done, first
and foremost, to the peremptory challenge system, which

3 It does not seem to me that even this premise is correct. Wise observers have long understood that the appearance of justice is as important as
its reality. If the system of peremptory strikes affects the actual impartiality of the jury not a bit, but gives litigants a greater belief in that
impartiality, it serves a most important function. See, e. g., 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *353. In point of fact, that may well be its greater
value.

loses its whole character when (in order to defend against
"impermissible stereotyping" claims) "reasons" for strikes
must be given. The right of peremptory challenge " `is, as
Blackstone says, an arbitrary and capricious right; and it
must be exercised with full freedom, or it fails of its full
purpose.' " Lewis v. United States, 146 U. S. 370, 378 (1892),
quoting Lamb v. State, 36 Wis. 424, 427 (1874). See also
Lewis, supra, at 376; United States v. Marchant, 12 Wheat.
480, 482 (1827) (Story, J.); 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries
*353. The loss of the real peremptory will be felt most
keenly by the criminal defendant, see Georgia v. McCollum,
505 U. S. 42 (1992), whom we have until recently thought
"should not be held to accept a juror, apparently indifferent, whom he distrusted for any reason or for no reason."
Lamb, supra, at 426. And make no mistake about it: there
really is no substitute for the peremptory. Voir dire (though
it can be expected to expand as a consequence of today's
decision) cannot fill the gap. The biases that go along with
group characteristics tend to be biases that the juror himself does not perceive, so that it is no use asking about them.
It is fruitless to inquire of a male juror whether he harbors
any subliminal prejudice in favor of unwed fathers.

And damage has been done, secondarily, to the entire justice system, which will bear the burden of the expanded
quest for "reasoned peremptories" that the Court demands.
The extension of Batson to sex, and almost certainly beyond,
cf. Batson, 476 U. S., at 124 (Burger, C. J., dissenting), will
provide the basis for extensive collateral litigation, which especially the criminal defendant (who litigates full time and
cost free) can be expected to pursue. While demographic
reality places some limit on the number of cases in which
race-based challenges will be an issue, every case contains a
potential sex-based claim. Another consequence, as I have
mentioned, is a lengthening of the voir dire process that
already burdens trial courts.

Scalia, J., dissenting
The irrationality of today's strike-by-strike approach toequal protection is evident from the consequences of extending it to its logical conclusion. If a fair and impartialtrial is a prosecutor's only legitimate goal; if adversarial trial
stratagems must be tested against that goal in abstractionfrom their role within the system as a whole; and if, so tested, sex-based stratagems do not survive heightened scru-tiny--then the prosecutor presumably violates the Constitution when he selects a male or female police officer to testifybecause he believes one or the other sex might be more convincing in the context of the particular case, or because hebelieves one or the other might be more appealing to a predominantly male or female jury. A decision to stress oneline of argument or present certain witnesses before a
mostly female jury--for example, to stress that the defend-ant victimized women--becomes, under the Court's reasoning, intentional discrimination by a state actor on the basisof gender.

* * *In order, it seems to me, not to eliminate any real denial
of equal protection, but simply to pay conspicuous obeisanceto the equality of the sexes, the Court imperils a practice
that has been considered an essential part of fair jury trialsince the dawn of the common law. The Constitution of the
United States neither requires nor permits this vandalizingof our people's traditions.

For these reasons, I dissent.

CENTRAL BANK OF DENVER, N. A. v. FIRSTINTERSTATE BANK OF DENVER, N. A.,

et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 92-854. Argued November 30, 1993--Decided April 19, 1994
As this Court has interpreted it, $ 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of

1934 imposes private civil liability on those who commit a manipulative
or deceptive act in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.
Following a public building authority's default on certain bonds secured
by landowner assessment liens, respondents, as purchasers of the bonds,
filed suit against the authority, the bonds' underwriters, the developer
of the land in question, and petitioner bank, as the indenture trustee for
the bond issues. Respondents alleged that the first three defendants
had violated $ 10(b) in connection with the sale of the bonds, and that
petitioner was "secondarily liable under $ 10(b) for its conduct in aiding
and abetting the [other defendants'] fraud." The District Court
granted summary judgment to petitioner, but the Court of Appeals reversed in light of Circuit precedent allowing private aiding and abetting
actions under $ 10(b).

Held: A private plaintiff may not maintain an aiding and abetting suit

under $ 10(b). Pp. 170-192.

(a) This case is resolved by the statutory text, which governs what
conduct is covered by $ 10(b). See, e. g., Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder,
425 U. S. 185, 197, 199. That text--which makes it "unlawful for any
person, directly or indirectly, . . . [t]o use or employ, in connection with
the purchase or sale of any security . . . , any manipulative or deceptive
device or contrivance"--prohibits only the making of a material misstatement (or omission) or the commission of a manipulative act, and
does not reach those who aid and abet a violation. The "directly or
indirectly" phrase does not cover aiding and abetting, since liability for
aiding and abetting would extend beyond persons who engage, even
indirectly, in a proscribed activity to include those who merely give
some degree of aid to violators, and since the "directly or indirectly"
language is used in numerous 1934 Act provisions in a way that does
not impose aiding and abetting liability. Pp. 170-178.

(b) Even if the $ 10(b) text did not answer the question at issue, the
same result would be reached by inferring how the 1934 Congress would
have addressed the question had it expressly included a $ 10(b) private

right of action in the 1934 Act. See Musick, Peeler & Garrett v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, 508 U. S. 286, 294. None of the express private
causes of action in the federal securities laws imposes liability on aiders
and abettors. It thus can be inferred that Congress likely would not
have attached such liability to a private $ 10(b) cause of action. See id.,
at 297. Pp. 178-180.

(c) Contrary to respondents' contention, the statutory silence cannot
be interpreted as tantamount to an explicit congressional intent to impose $ 10(b) aiding and abetting liability. Congress has not enacted a
general civil aiding and abetting tort liability statute, but has instead
taken a statute-by-statute approach to such liability. Nor did it provide
for aiding and abetting liability in any of the private causes of action in
the 1933 and 1934 securities Acts, but mandated it only in provisions
enforceable in actions brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Pp. 180-185.

(d) The parties' competing arguments based on other post-1934
legislative developments--respondents' contentions that congressional
acquiescence in their position is demonstrated by 1983 and 1988
Committee Reports making oblique references to $ 10(b) aiding and
abetting liability and by Congress' failure to enact a provision denying
such liability after the lower courts began interpreting $ 10(b) to include
it, and petitioner's assertion that Congress' failure to pass 1957, 1958,
and 1960 bills expressly creating such liability reveals an intent not to
cover it--deserve little weight in the interpretive process, would not
point to a definitive answer in any event, and are therefore rejected.
Pp. 185-188.

(e) The SEC's various policy arguments in support of the aiding and
abetting cause of action--e. g., that the cause of action deters secondary
actors from contributing to fraudulent activities and ensures that defrauded plaintiffs are made whole--cannot override the Court's interpretation of the Act's text and structure because such arguments do
not show that adherence to the text and structure would lead to a result
so bizarre that Congress could not have intended it. Demarest v.
Manspeaker, 498 U. S. 184, 191. It is far from clear that Congress in
1934 would have decided that the statutory purposes of fair dealing and
efficiency in the securities markets would be furthered by the imposition
of private aider and abettor liability, in light of the uncertainty and
unpredictability of the rules for determining such liability, the potential
for excessive litigation arising therefrom, and the resulting difficulties
and costs that would be experienced by client companies and investors.
Pp. 188-190.

(f) The Court rejects the suggestion that a private civil $ 10(b) aiding
and abetting cause of action may be based on 18 U. S. C. $ 2, a general

The logical consequence of the SEC's approach would be the implication
of a civil damages cause of action for every criminal statute passed for

must answer a question reserved in two earlier decisions:whether private civil liability under $ 10(b) extends as well

to those who do not engage in the manipulative or deceptivepractice, but who aid and abet the violation. See Herman &
MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375, 379, n. 5 (1983);
Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185, 191-192, n. 7(1976).

I
In 1986 and 1988, the Colorado Springs-Stetson Hills Pub-lic Building Authority (Authority) issued a total of $26 million in bonds to finance public improvements at Stetson Hills,a planned residential and commercial development in Colorado Springs. Petitioner Central Bank of Denver served asindenture trustee for the bond issues.

The bonds were secured by landowner assessment liens,which covered about 250 acres for the 1986 bond issue and
about 272 acres for the 1988 bond issue. The bond cove-nants required that the land subject to the liens be worth at
least 160% of the bonds' outstanding principal and interest.The covenants required AmWest Development, the developer of Stetson Hills, to give Central Bank an annual reportcontaining evidence that the 160% test was met.

In January 1988, AmWest provided Central Bank with anupdated appraisal of the land securing the 1986 bonds and of
the land proposed to secure the 1988 bonds. The 1988 ap-praisal showed land values almost unchanged from the 1986
appraisal. Soon afterwards, Central Bank received a letterfrom the senior underwriter for the 1986 bonds. Noting
that property values were declining in Colorado Springs andthat Central Bank was operating on an appraisal over 16
months old, the underwriter expressed concern that the160% test was not being met.

Central Bank asked its in-house appraiser to review theupdated 1988 appraisal. The in-house appraiser decided
that the values listed in the appraisal appeared optimisticconsidering the local real estate market. He suggested that

INTERSTATE BANK OF DENVER, N. A.

Opinion of the Court

Central Bank retain an outside appraiser to conduct an inde-pendent review of the 1988 appraisal. After an exchange of

letters between Central Bank and AmWest in early 1988,Central Bank agreed to delay independent review of the appraisal until the end of the year, six months after the June
1988 closing on the bond issue. Before the independent re-view was complete, however, the Authority defaulted on the

1988 bonds.Respondents First Interstate Bank of Denver and Jack K.
Naber had purchased $2.1 million of the 1988 bonds. Afterthe default, respondents sued the Authority, the 1988 underwriter, a junior underwriter, an AmWest director, and Central Bank for violations of $ 10(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. The complaint alleged that the Authority, the
underwriter defendants, and the AmWest director had violated $ 10(b). The complaint also alleged that Central Bank
was "secondarily liable under $ 10(b) for its conduct in aiding
and abetting the fraud." App. 26.

The United States District Court for the District of Colorado granted summary judgment to Central Bank. The
United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A. v. Pring,
969 F. 2d 891 (1992).

The Court of Appeals first set forth the elements of the

$ 10(b) aiding and abetting cause of action in the Tenth Circuit: (1) a primary violation of $ 10(b); (2) recklessness by the
aider and abettor as to the existence of the primary violation;
and (3) substantial assistance given to the primary violator
by the aider and abettor. Id., at 898-903.

Applying that standard, the Court of Appeals found that
Central Bank was aware of concerns about the accuracy of
the 1988 appraisal. Central Bank knew both that the sale
of the 1988 bonds was imminent and that purchasers were
using the 1988 appraisal to evaluate the collateral for the
bonds. Under those circumstances, the court said, Central
Bank's awareness of the alleged inadequacies of the updated,

Opinion of the Court
but almost unchanged, 1988 appraisal could support a findingof extreme departure from standards of ordinary care. The

court thus found that respondents had established a genuineissue of material fact regarding the recklessness element of
aiding and abetting liability. Id., at 904. On the separate
question whether Central Bank rendered substantial assist-ance to the primary violators, the Court of Appeals found

that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that CentralBank had rendered substantial assistance by delaying the
independent review of the appraisal. Ibid.Like the Court of Appeals in this case, other federal courts
have allowed private aiding and abetting actions under

$ 10(b). The first and leading case to impose the liability
was Brennan v. Midwestern United Life Ins. Co., 259 F.
Supp. 673 (ND Ind. 1966), aff 'd, 417 F. 2d 147 (CA7 1969),
cert. denied, 397 U. S. 989 (1970). The court reasoned that
"[i]n the absence of a clear legislative expression to the contrary, the statute must be flexibly applied so as to implement
its policies and purposes." 259 F. Supp., at 680-681. Since
1966, numerous courts have taken the same position. See,
e. g., Cleary v. Perfectune, Inc., 700 F. 2d 774, 777 (CA1 1983);
Kerbs v. Fall River Industries, Inc., 502 F. 2d 731, 740
(CA10 1974).

After our decisions in Santa Fe Industries, Inc. v. Green,
430 U. S. 462 (1977), and Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425
U. S. 185 (1976), where we paid close attention to the statutory text in defining the scope of conduct prohibited by

$ 10(b), courts and commentators began to question whether
aiding and abetting liability under $ 10(b) was still available.
Professor Fischel opined that the "theory of secondary liability [under $ 10(b) was] no longer viable in light of recent Supreme Court decisions strictly interpreting the federal securities laws." Secondary Liability Under Section 10(b) of the
Securities Act of 1934, 69 Calif. L. Rev. 80, 82 (1981). In
1981, the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan

will continue to exist under 10(b)." Benoay v. Decker, 517F. Supp. 490, 495, aff 'd, 735 F. 2d 1363 (CA6 1984). The same

year, the Ninth Circuit stated that the "status of aiding andabetting as a basis for liability under the securities laws
[was] in some doubt." Little v. Valley National Bank of
Arizona, 650 F. 2d 218, 220, n. 3. The Ninth Circuit laternoted that "[a]iding and abetting and other `add-on' theories

of liability have been justified by reference to the broad pol-icy objectives of the securities acts. . . . The Supreme Court
has rejected this justification for an expansive reading of thestatutes and instead prescribed a strict statutory construction approach to determining liability under the acts." SECv.

Seaboard Corp., 677 F. 2d 1301, 1311, n. 12 (1982). TheFifth Circuit has stated: "[I]t is now apparent that openended readings of the duty stated by Rule 10b-5 threatento rearrange the congressional scheme. The added layer of
liability . . . for aiding and abetting . . . is particularly prob-lematic. . . . There is a powerful argument that . . . aider and
abettor liability should not be enforceable by private partiespursuing an implied right of action."

Akin v. Q-L Invest-ments, Inc., 959 F. 2d 521, 525 (1992). Indeed, the Seventh

Circuit has held that the defendant must have committed amanipulative or deceptive act to be liable under $ 10(b), a
requirement that in effect forecloses liability on those whodo no more than aid or abet a 10b-5 violation. See, e. g.,
Barker v. Henderson, Franklin, Starnes & Holt, 797 F. 2d490, 495 (1986).

We granted certiorari to resolve the continuing confusionover the existence and scope of the $ 10(b) aiding and abetting action. 508 U. S. 959 (1993).

may bring administrative actions and injunctive proceedingsto enforce a variety of statutory prohibitions. Private plaintiffs may sue under the express private rights of action con-tained in the Acts. They may also sue under private rights
of action we have found to be implied by the terms of $$ 10(b)and 14(a) of the 1934 Act.

INTERSTATE BANK OF DENVER, N. A.

Opinion of the Court

Rule 10b-5, adopted by the SEC in 1942, casts the proscrip-tion in similar terms:

"It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indi-rectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of
interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any facility ofany national securities exchange,

"(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice todefraud,
"(b) To make any untrue statement of a material factor to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to
make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or"(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or de-ceit upon any person,

"in connection with the purchase or sale of any secu-rity." 17 CFR $ 240.10b-5 (1993).

In our cases addressing $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, we haveconfronted two main issues. First, we have determined the
scope of conduct prohibited by $ 10(b). See, e. g., Dirks v.
SEC, 463 U. S. 646 (1983); Aaron v. SEC, 446 U. S. 680 (1980);
Chiarella v. United States, 445 U. S. 222 (1980); Santa Fe
Industries, Inc. v. Green, 430 U. S. 462 (1977); Ernst & Ernst
v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S. 185 (1976). Second, in cases where
the defendant has committed a violation of $ 10(b), we havedecided questions about the elements of the 10b-5 private

liability scheme: for example, whether there is a right to con-tribution, what the statute of limitations is, whether there is
a reliance requirement, and whether there is an in pari delicto defense. See Musick, Peeler & Garrett v. Employers
Ins. of Wausau, 508 U. S. 286 (1993); Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind,
Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U. S. 350 (1991); Basic
Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S. 224 (1988); Bateman Eichler, Hill
Richards, Inc. v. Berner, 472 U. S. 299 (1985); see also Blue
Chip Stamps, supra; Schlick v. Penn-Dixie Cement Corp.,

507 F. 2d 374 (CA2 1974); cf. Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v.
Sandberg, 501 U. S. 1083 (1991) ($ 14); Schreiber v. Burlington Northern, Inc., 472 U. S. 1 (1985) (same).The latter issue, determining the elements of the 10b-5

private liability scheme, has posed difficulty because Congress did not create a private $ 10(b) cause of action and hadno occasion to provide guidance about the elements of a private liability scheme. We thus have had "to infer how the1934 Congress would have addressed the issue[s] had the
10b-5 action been included as an express provision in the1934 Act."

Musick, Peeler, supra, at 294.
With respect, however, to the first issue, the scope of conduct prohibited by $ 10(b), the text of the statute controls
our decision. In $ 10(b), Congress prohibited manipulative
or deceptive acts in connection with the purchase or sale of
securities. It envisioned that the SEC would enforce the
statutory prohibition through administrative and injunctive
actions. Of course, a private plaintiff now may bring suit
against violators of $ 10(b). But the private plaintiff may
not bring a 10b-5 suit against a defendant for acts not prohibited by the text of $ 10(b). To the contrary, our cases
considering the scope of conduct prohibited by $ 10(b) in
private suits have emphasized adherence to the statutory
language, " `[t]he starting point in every case involving construction of a statute.' " Ernst & Ernst, supra, at 197 (quoting Blue Chip Stamps, 421 U. S., at 756 (Powell, J., concurring)); see Chiarella, supra, at 226; Santa Fe Industries,
supra, at 472. We have refused to allow 10b-5 challenges
to conduct not prohibited by the text of the statute.

In Ernst & Ernst, we considered whether negligent acts
could violate $ 10(b). We first noted that "[t]he words `manipulative or deceptive' used in conjunction with `device or
contrivance' strongly suggest that $ 10(b) was intended to
proscribe knowing or intentional misconduct." 425 U. S., at
197. The SEC argued that the broad congressional purposes behind the Act--to protect investors from false and

Opinion of the Court

misleading practices that might injure them--suggested that$ 10(b) should also reach negligent conduct.

Id., at 198. We
rejected that argument, concluding that the SEC's interpre-tation would "add a gloss to the operative language of the

statute quite different from its commonly accepted meaning." Id., at 199.In

Santa Fe Industries, another case involving "the reach
and coverage of $ 10(b)," 430 U. S., at 464, we consideredwhether $ 10(b) "reached breaches of fiduciary duty by a majority against minority shareholders without any charge ofmisrepresentation or lack of disclosure."

Id., at 470 (internal quotation marks omitted). We held that it did not, reaffirming our decision in Ernst & Ernst and emphasizing that
the "language of $ 10(b) gives no indication that Congress
meant to prohibit any conduct not involving manipulation or
deception." 430 U. S., at 473.

Later, in Chiarella, we considered whether $ 10(b) is violated when a person trades securities without disclosing inside information. We held that $ 10(b) is not violated under
those circumstances unless the trader has an independent
duty of disclosure. In reaching our conclusion, we noted
that "not every instance of financial unfairness constitutes
fraudulent activity under $ 10(b)." 445 U. S., at 232. We
stated that "the 1934 Act cannot be read more broadly than
its language and the statutory scheme reasonably permit,"
and we found "no basis for applying . . . a new and different
theory of liability" in that case. Id., at 234 (internal quotation marks omitted). "Section 10(b) is aptly described as a
catchall provision, but what it catches must be fraud. When
an allegation of fraud is based upon nondisclosure, there can
be no fraud absent a duty to speak." Id., at 234-235.

Adherence to the text in defining the conduct covered by

$ 10(b) is consistent with our decisions interpreting other
provisions of the securities Acts. In Pinter v. Dahl, 486
U. S. 622 (1988), for example, we interpreted the word
"seller" in $ 12(1) of the 1933 Act by "look[ing] first at the

Opinion of the Court
language of $ 12(1)." Id., at 641. Ruling that a seller is onewho solicits securities sales for financial gain, we rejected

the broader contention, "grounded in tort doctrine," thatpersons who participate in the sale can also be deemed sellers. Id., at 649. We found "no support in the statutory language or legislative history for expansion of $ 12(1)," id., at650, and stated that "[t]he ascertainment of congressional

intent with respect to the scope of liability created by a par-ticular section of the Securities Act must rest primarily on
the language of that section." Id., at 653.Last Term, the Court faced a similar issue, albeit outside the
securities context, in a case raising the question whether
knowing participation in a breach of fiduciary duty is actionable under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of

1974 (ERISA). Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508 U. S. 248
(1993). The petitioner in Mertens said that the knowing participation cause of action had been available in the common law
of trusts and should be available under ERISA. We rejected
that argument and noted that no provision in ERISA "explicitly require[d] [nonfiduciaries] to avoid participation (knowing
or unknowing) in a fiduciary's breach of fiduciary duty." Id.,
at 254. While plaintiffs had a remedy against nonfiduciaries
at common law, that was because "nonfiduciaries had a duty to
the beneficiaries not to assist in the fiduciary's breach." Id.,
at 255, n. 5. No comparable duty was set forth in ERISA.

Our consideration of statutory duties, especially in cases
interpreting $ 10(b), establishes that the statutory text controls the definition of conduct covered by $ 10(b). That
bodes ill for respondents, for "the language of Section 10(b)
does not in terms mention aiding and abetting." Brief for
SEC as Amicus Curiae 8 (hereinafter Brief for SEC). To
overcome this problem, respondents and the SEC suggest
(or hint at) the novel argument that the use of the phrase
"directly or indirectly" in the text of $ 10(b) covers aiding
and abetting. See Brief for Respondents 15 ("Inclusion of
those who act `indirectly' suggests a legislative purpose fully

Opinion of the Court

consistent with the prohibition of aiding and abetting");Brief for SEC 8 ("[W]e think that when read in context

[$ 10(b)] is broad enough to encompass liability for such `indi-rect' violations").

The federal courts have not relied on the "directly or indirectly" language when imposing aiding and abetting liabilityunder $ 10(b), and with good reason. There is a basic flaw

with this interpretation. According to respondents and theSEC, the "directly or indirectly" language shows that "Congress . . . intended to reach all persons who engage, even ifonly indirectly, in proscribed activities connected with securities transactions." Ibid. The problem, of course, is that
aiding and abetting liability extends beyond persons who engage, even indirectly, in a proscribed activity; aiding and
abetting liability reaches persons who do not engage in the
proscribed activities at all, but who give a degree of aid to
those who do. A further problem with respondents' interpretation of the "directly or indirectly" language is posed by
the numerous provisions of the 1934 Act that use the term
in a way that does not impose aiding and abetting liability.
See $ 7(f )(2)(C), 15 U. S. C. $ 78g(f )(2)(C) (direct or indirect
ownership of stock); $ 9(b)(2)-(3), 15 U. S. C. $ 78i(b)(2)-(3)
(direct or indirect interest in put, call, straddle, option, or
privilege); $ 13(d)(1), 15 U. S. C. $ 78m(d)(1) (direct or indirect
ownership); $ 16(a), 15 U. S. C. $ 78p(a) (direct or indirect
ownership); $ 20, 15 U. S. C. $ 78t (direct or indirect control
of person violating Act). In short, respondents' interpretation of the "directly or indirectly" language fails to support
their suggestion that the text of $ 10(b) itself prohibits aiding
and abetting. See 5B A. Jacobs, Litigation and Practice
Under Rule 10b-5 $ 40.07, p. 2-465 (rev. 1993).

Congress knew how to impose aiding and abetting liability
when it chose to do so. See, e. g., Act of Mar. 4, 1909, $ 332,
35 Stat. 1152, as amended, 18 U. S. C. $ 2 (general criminal
aiding and abetting statute); Packers and Stockyards Act,
1921, ch. 64, $ 202, 42 Stat. 161, as amended, 7 U. S. C. $ 192(g)

Opinion of the Court
(1988 ed. and Supp. IV) (civil aiding and abetting provision);
see generally infra, at 181-185. If, as respondents seem to
say, Congress intended to impose aiding and abetting liability, we presume it would have used the words "aid" and
"abet" in the statutory text. But it did not. Cf. Pinter v.
Dahl, 486 U. S., at 650 ("When Congress wished to create
such liability, it had little trouble doing so"); Blue Chip
Stamps, 421 U. S., at 734 ("When Congress wished to provide
a remedy to those who neither purchase nor sell securities,
it had little trouble in doing so expressly").

We reach the uncontroversial conclusion, accepted even by
those courts recognizing a $ 10(b) aiding and abetting cause
of action, that the text of the 1934 Act does not itself reach
those who aid and abet a $ 10(b) violation. Unlike those
courts, however, we think that conclusion resolves the case.
It is inconsistent with settled methodology in $ 10(b) cases to
extend liability beyond the scope of conduct prohibited by
the statutory text. To be sure, aiding and abetting a wrongdoer ought to be actionable in certain instances. Cf. Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 876(b) (1977). The issue, however, is not whether imposing private civil liability on aiders
and abettors is good policy but whether aiding and abetting
is covered by the statute.

As in earlier cases considering conduct prohibited by

$ 10(b), we again conclude that the statute prohibits only the
making of a material misstatement (or omission) or the commission of a manipulative act. See Santa Fe Industries, 430
U. S., at 473 ("language of $ 10(b) gives no indication that
Congress meant to prohibit any conduct not involving manipulation or deception"); Ernst & Ernst, 425 U. S., at 214
("When a statute speaks so specifically in terms of manipulation and deception . . . , we are quite unwilling to extend
the scope of the statute"). The proscription does not include
giving aid to a person who commits a manipulative or deceptive act. We cannot amend the statute to create liability for

Opinion of the Court

acts that are not themselves manipulative or deceptivewithin the meaning of the statute.

III
Because this case concerns the conduct prohibited by$ 10(b), the statute itself resolves the case, but even if it did

not, we would reach the same result. When the text of$ 10(b) does not resolve a particular issue, we attempt to
infer "how the 1934 Congress would have addressed theissue had the 10b-5 action been included as an express provision in the 1934 Act." Musick, Peeler, 508 U. S., at 294.For that inquiry, we use the express causes of action in the
securities Acts as the primary model for the $ 10(b) action.The reason is evident: Had the 73d Congress enacted a private $ 10(b) right of action, it likely would have designed itin a manner similar to the other private rights of action in
the securities Acts. See id., at 294-297.In Musick, Peeler, for example, we recognized a right to
contribution under $ 10(b). We held that the express rightsof contribution contained in $$ 9 and 18 of the Acts were
"important . . . feature[s] of the federal securities laws andthat consistency require[d] us to adopt a like contribution
rule for the right of action existing under Rule 10b-5." Id.,at 297. In

Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U. S., at 243, we de-cided that a plaintiff in a 10b-5 action must prove that he

relied on the defendant's misrepresentation in order to re-cover damages. In so holding, we stated that the "analogous express right of action"--$ 18(a) of the 1934 Act--"includes a reliance requirement." Ibid. And in Blue Chip
Stamps, we held that a 10b-5 plaintiff must have purchasedor sold the security to recover damages for the defendant's
misrepresentation. We said that "[t]he principal expressnonderivative private civil remedies, created by Congress
contemporaneously with the passage of $ 10(b), . . . areby their terms expressly limited to purchasers or sellers of
securities." 421 U. S., at 735-736.

179Cite as: 511 U. S. 164 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
Following that analysis here, we look to the express pri-vate causes of action in the 1933 and 1934 Acts. See,

e. g.,
Musick, Peeler, supra, at 295-297; Blue Chip Stamps, supra,at 735-736. In the 1933 Act, $ 11 prohibits false statements

or omissions of material fact in registration statements; it
identifies the various categories of defendants subject toliability for a violation, but that list does not include aiders

and abettors. 15 U. S. C. $ 77k. Section 12 prohibits thesale of unregistered, nonexempt securities as well as the sale
of securities by means of a material misstatement or omis-sion; and it limits liability to those who offer or sell the security. 15 U. S. C. $ 77l. In the 1934 Act, $ 9 prohibits any
person from engaging in manipulative practices such as wash
sales, matched orders, and the like. 15 U. S. C. $ 78i. Section 16 regulates short-swing trading by owners, directors,
and officers. 15 U. S. C. $ 78p. Section 18 prohibits any
person from making misleading statements in reports filed
with the SEC. 15 U. S. C. $ 78r. And $ 20A, added in 1988,
prohibits any person from engaging in insider trading. 15
U. S. C. $ 78t-1.

This survey of the express causes of action in the securities Acts reveals that each (like $ 10(b)) specifies the conduct
for which defendants may be held liable. Some of the express causes of action specify categories of defendants who
may be liable; others (like $ 10(b)) state only that "any person" who commits one of the prohibited acts may be held
liable. The important point for present purposes, however,
is that none of the express causes of action in the 1934 Act
further imposes liability on one who aids or abets a violation.
Cf. 7 U. S. C. $ 25(a)(1) (1988 ed. and Supp. IV) (Commodity
Exchange Act's private civil aiding and abetting provision).

From the fact that Congress did not attach private aiding
and abetting liability to any of the express causes of action
in the securities Acts, we can infer that Congress likely
would not have attached aiding and abetting liability to

$ 10(b) had it provided a private $ 10(b) cause of action. See

Opinion of the Court

Musick, Peeler, supra, at 297 ("[C]onsistency requires us toadopt a like contribution rule for the right of action existing

under Rule 10b-5"). There is no reason to think that Con-gress would have attached aiding and abetting liability only
to $ 10(b) and not to any of the express private rights ofaction in the Act. In

Blue Chip Stamps, we noted that itwould be "anomalous to impute to Congress an intention to

expand the plaintiff class for a judicially implied cause ofaction beyond the bounds it delineated for comparable express causes of action." 421 U. S., at 736. Here, it wouldbe just as anomalous to impute to Congress an intention in
effect to expand the defendant class for 10b-5 actions beyondthe bounds delineated for comparable express causes of
action.Our reasoning is confirmed by the fact that respondents'
argument would impose 10b-5 aiding and abetting liabilitywhen at least one element critical for recovery under 10b-5
is absent: reliance. A plaintiff must show reliance on thedefendant's misstatement or omission to recover under
10b-5. Basic Inc. v. Levinson, supra, at 243. Were we toallow the aiding and abetting action proposed in this case,
the defendant could be liable without any showing that theplaintiff relied upon the aider and abettor's statements or
actions. See also Chiarella, 445 U. S., at 228 (omissionactionable only where duty to disclose arises from specific
relationship between two parties). Allowing plaintiffs tocircumvent the reliance requirement would disregard the
careful limits on 10b-5 recovery mandated by our earliercases.

IV
Respondents make further arguments for imposition of$ 10(b) aiding and abetting liability, none of which leads us to

a different answer. A

The text does not support their point, but respondents andsome

amici invoke a broad-based notion of congressional

Opinion of the Court
intent. They say that Congress legislated with an under-standing of general principles of tort law and that aiding and

abetting liability was "well established in both civil and crim-inal actions by 1934." Brief for SEC 10. Thus, "Congress
intended to include" aiding and abetting liability in the 1934
Act. Id., at 11. A brief history of aiding and abetting lia-bility serves to dispose of this argument.

Aiding and abetting is an ancient criminal law doctrine.See

United States v. Peoni, 100 F. 2d 401, 402 (CA2 1938); 1
M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 615 (1736). Though there is nofederal common law of crimes, Congress in 1909 enacted

what is now 18 U. S. C. $ 2, a general aiding and abetting
statute applicable to all federal criminal offenses. Act of
Mar. 4, 1909, $ 332, 35 Stat. 1152. The statute decrees that
those who provide knowing aid to persons committing federal crimes, with the intent to facilitate the crime, are themselves committing a crime. Nye & Nissen v. United States,
336 U. S. 613, 619 (1949).

The Restatement of Torts, under a concert of action principle, accepts a doctrine with rough similarity to criminal aiding and abetting. An actor is liable for harm resulting to a
third person from the tortious conduct of another "if he . . .
knows that the other's conduct constitutes a breach of duty
and gives substantial assistance or encouragement to the
other . . . ." Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 876(b) (1977);
see also W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser
and Keeton on Law of Torts 322-324 (5th ed. 1984). The
doctrine has been at best uncertain in application, however.
As the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
noted in a comprehensive opinion on the subject, the leading
cases applying this doctrine are statutory securities cases,
with the common-law precedents "largely confined to isolated acts of adolescents in rural society." Halberstam v.
Welch, 705 F. 2d 472, 489 (1983). Indeed, in some States, it
is still unclear whether there is aiding and abetting tort liability of the kind set forth in $ 876(b) of the Restatement.

Opinion of the Court

See, e. g., FDIC v. S. Prawer & Co., 829 F. Supp. 453, 457(Me. 1993) (in Maine, "[i]t is clear . . . that aiding and abetting

liability did not exist under the common law, but was entirelya creature of statute");

In re Asbestos School Litigation, No.
83-0268, 1991 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 10471, *34 (ED Pa., July 18,

Assn., 639 F. Supp. 643, 653 (ED Va. 1986) (aiding and abetting tort based on Restatement $ 876 "not expressly recog-nized by the state courts of the Commonwealth" of Virginia);

(1989) (aiding and abetting tort liability is issue "of first impression in Montana").

More to the point, Congress has not enacted a general civil
aiding and abetting statute--either for suits by the Government (when the Government sues for civil penalties or injunctive relief) or for suits by private parties. Thus, when
Congress enacts a statute under which a person may sue and
recover damages from a private defendant for the defendant's violation of some statutory norm, there is no general
presumption that the plaintiff may also sue aiders and abettors. See, e. g., Electronic Laboratory Supply Co. v. Cullen,
977 F. 2d 798, 805-806 (CA3 1992).

Congress instead has taken a statute-by-statute approach
to civil aiding and abetting liability. For example, the Internal Revenue Code contains a full section governing aiding
and abetting liability, complete with description of scienter
and the penalties attached. 26 U. S. C. $ 6701 (1988 ed. and
Supp. IV). The Commodity Exchange Act contains an explicit aiding and abetting provision that applies to private
suits brought under that Act. 7 U. S. C. $ 25(a)(1) (1988 ed.
and Supp. IV); see also, e. g., 12 U. S. C. $ 93(b)(8) (1988 ed.
and Supp. IV) (National Bank Act defines violations to include "aiding or abetting"); 12 U. S. C. $ 504(h) (1988 ed. and

are remediable only in actions brought by the SEC. See,

brokers and dealers who aid and abet various violations of

With this background in mind, we think respondents' argument based on implicit congressional intent can be taken in
one of three ways. First, respondents might be saying that
aiding and abetting should attach to all federal civil statutes,
even laws that do not contain an explicit aiding and abetting
provision. But neither respondents nor their amici cite, and
we have not found, any precedent for that vast expansion of
federal law. It does not appear Congress was operating on
that assumption in 1934, or since then, given that it has been
quite explicit in imposing civil aiding and abetting liability
in other instances. We decline to recognize such a comprehensive rule with no expression of congressional direction to
do so.

Second, on a more narrow ground, respondents' congressional intent argument might be interpreted to suggest that
the 73d Congress intended to include aiding and abetting
only in $ 10(b). But nothing in the text or history of $ 10(b)
even implies that aiding and abetting was covered by the
statutory prohibition on manipulative and deceptive conduct.

Third, respondents' congressional intent argument might
be construed as a contention that the 73d Congress intended
to impose aiding and abetting liability for all of the express

Opinion of the Court

causes of action contained in the 1934 Act--and thus wouldhave imposed aiding and abetting liability in $ 10(b) actions

had it enacted a private $ 10(b) right of action. As we haveexplained, however, none of the express private causes of
action in the Act imposes aiding and abetting liability, and
there is no evidence that Congress intended that liability forthe express causes of action.

Even assuming, moreover, a deeply rooted background ofaiding and abetting tort liability, it does not follow that
Congress intended to apply that kind of liability to the pri-vate causes of action in the securities Acts. Cf.

Mertens,
508 U. S., at 254 (omission of knowing participation liability
in ERISA "appears all the more deliberate in light of the
fact that `knowing participation' liability on the part of both
cotrustees and third persons was well established under
the common law of trusts"). In addition, Congress did not
overlook secondary liability when it created the private
rights of action in the 1934 Act. Section 20 of the 1934 Act
imposes liability on "controlling person[s]"--persons who
"contro[l] any person liable under any provision of this chapter or of any rule or regulation thereunder." 15 U. S. C.

$ 78t(a). This suggests that "[w]hen Congress wished to create such [secondary] liability, it had little trouble doing so."
Pinter v. Dahl, 486 U. S., at 650; cf. Touche Ross & Co. v.
Redington, 442 U. S. 560, 572 (1979) ("Obviously, then, when
Congress wished to provide a private damages remedy, it
knew how to do so and did so expressly"); see also Fischel,
69 Calif. L. Rev., at 96-98. Aiding and abetting is "a method
by which courts create secondary liability" in persons other
than the violator of the statute. Pinter v. Dahl, supra, at
648, n. 24. The fact that Congress chose to impose some
forms of secondary liability, but not others, indicates a deliberate congressional choice with which the courts should not
interfere.

We note that the 1929 Uniform Sale of Securities Act contained a private aiding and abetting cause of action. And at

Opinion of the Court
the time Congress passed the 1934 Act, the blue sky laws of11 States and the Territory of Hawaii provided a private

right of action against those who aided a fraudulent or illegalsale of securities. See Abrams, The Scope of Liability
Under Section 12 of the Securities Act of 1933: "Participa-tion" and the Pertinent Legislative Materials, 15 Ford. Urb.
L. J. 877, 945, and n. 423 (1987) (listing provisions). Con-gress enacted the 1933 and 1934 Acts against this backdrop,
but did not provide for aiding and abetting liability in any ofthe private causes of action it authorized.

In sum, it is not plausible to interpret the statutory silenceas tantamount to an implicit congressional intent to impose

$ 10(b) aiding and abetting liability.

B
When Congress reenacts statutory language that has beengiven a consistent judicial construction, we often adhere to

that construction in interpreting the reenacted statutory lan-guage. See,

e. g., Keene Corp. v. United States, 508 U. S.200, 212-213 (1993); Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 567

(1988); Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 580-581 (1978). Con-gress has not reenacted the language of $ 10(b) since 1934,
however, so we need not determine whether the other condi-tions for applying the reenactment doctrine are present.
Cf. Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U. S. 517, 527-532 (1994).Nonetheless, the parties advance competing arguments
based on other post-1934 legislative developments to supporttheir differing interpretations of $ 10(b). Respondents note
that 1983 and 1988 Committee Reports, which make obliquereferences to aiding and abetting liability, show that those
Congresses interpreted $ 10(b) to cover aiding and abetting.H. R. Rep. No. 100-910, pp. 27-28 (1988); H. R. Rep. No. 355,
p. 10 (1983). But "[w]e have observed on more than one oc-casion that the interpretation given by one Congress (or a
committee or Member thereof) to an earlier statute is oflittle assistance in discerning the meaning of that statute."

Opinion of the Court

Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio v. Betts, 492U. S. 158, 168 (1989); see

Weinberger v. Rossi, 456 U. S. 25, 35
(1982); Consumer Product Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania,
Inc., 447 U. S. 102, 118, and n. 13 (1980).

Respondents observe that Congress has amended the
securities laws on various occasions since 1966, when courtsfirst began to interpret $ 10(b) to cover aiding and abetting,

but has done so without providing that aiding and abettingliability is not available under $ 10(b). From that, respondents infer that these Congresses, by silence, have acquiescedin the judicial interpretation of $ 10(b). We disagree. This
Court has reserved the issue of 10b-5 aiding and abetting
liability on two previous occasions. Herman & MacLean v.
Huddleston, 459 U. S., at 379, n. 5; Ernst & Ernst, 425 U. S.,
at 191-192, n. 7. Furthermore, our observations on the acquiescence doctrine indicate its limitations as an expression
of congressional intent. "It does not follow . . . that Congress' failure to overturn a statutory precedent is reason for
this Court to adhere to it. It is `impossible to assert with
any degree of assurance that congressional failure to act represents' affirmative congressional approval of the [courts']
statutory interpretation. . . . Congress may legislate, moreover, only through the passage of a bill which is approved by
both Houses and signed by the President. See U. S. Const.,
Art. I, $ 7, cl. 2. Congressional inaction cannot amend a duly
enacted statute." Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491
U. S. 164, 175, n. 1 (1989) (quoting Johnson v. Transportation
Agency, Santa Clara Cty., 480 U. S. 616, 672 (1987) (Scalia,

(1940) (Frankfurter, J.) ("[W]e walk on quicksand when we
try to find in the absence of corrective legislation a controlling legal principle").

Central Bank, for its part, points out that in 1957, 1959,
and 1960, bills were introduced that would have amended the
securities laws to make it "unlawful . . . to aid, abet, counsel,
command, induce, or procure the violation of any provision"

of the 1934 Act. S. 1179, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. $ 22 (1959);
see also S. 3770, 86th Cong., 2d Sess. $ 20 (1960); S. 2545, 85th
Cong., 1st Sess. $ 20 (1957). These bills prompted "industry
fears that private litigants, not only the SEC, may find in
this section a vehicle by which to sue aiders and abettors,"
and the bills were not passed. SEC Legislation: Hearings
before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency on S. 1178, S. 1179, S. 1180, S. 1181, and
S. 1182, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 288, 370 (1959). According to
Central Bank, these proposals reveal that those Congresses
interpreted $ 10(b) not to cover aiding and abetting. We
have stated, however, that failed legislative proposals are "a
particularly dangerous ground on which to rest an interpretation of a prior statute." Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U. S. 633, 650 (1990). "Congressional inaction lacks persuasive significance because several
equally tenable inferences may be drawn from such inaction,
including the inference that the existing legislation already
incorporated the offered change." Ibid. (internal quotation
marks omitted); see United States v. Wise, 370 U. S. 405,
411 (1962).

It is true that our cases have not been consistent in rejecting arguments such as these. Compare Flood v. Kuhn, 407
U. S. 258, 281-282 (1972), with Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation, supra, at 650; compare Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U. S. 353, 381-382
(1982), with Aaron v. SEC, 446 U. S., at 694, n. 11. As a
general matter, however, we have stated that these arguments deserve little weight in the interpretive process.
Even were that not the case, the competing arguments here
would not point to a definitive answer. We therefore reject
them. As we stated last Term, Congress has acknowledged
the 10b-5 action without any further attempt to define it.

statute. Id., at 291-292. That issue is our concern here,and we adhere to the statutory text in resolving it.

C
The SEC points to various policy arguments in support ofthe 10b-5 aiding and abetting cause of action. It argues, for

example, that the aiding and abetting cause of action deterssecondary actors from contributing to fraudulent activities
and ensures that defrauded plaintiffs are made whole. Brieffor SEC 16-17.

Policy considerations cannot override our interpretation ofthe text and structure of the Act, except to the extent that
they may help to show that adherence to the text and struc-ture would lead to a result "so bizarre" that Congress could
not have intended it. Demarest v. Manspeaker, 498 U. S.184, 191 (1991); cf.

Pinter v. Dahl, 486 U. S., at 654 ("[W]eneed not entertain Pinter's policy arguments");

Santa FeIndustries, 430 U. S., at 477 (language sufficiently clear to be

dispositive). That is not the case here.Extending the 10b-5 cause of action to aiders and abettors
no doubt makes the civil remedy more far reaching, but itdoes not follow that the objectives of the statute are better
served. Secondary liability for aiders and abettors exactscosts that may disserve the goals of fair dealing and efficiency in the securities markets.As an initial matter, the rules for determining aiding and
abetting liability are unclear, in "an area that demands cer-tainty and predictability."

Pinter v. Dahl, 486 U. S., at 652.That leads to the undesirable result of decisions "made on an

ad hoc basis, offering little predictive value" to those whoprovide services to participants in the securities business.
Ibid. "[S]uch a shifting and highly fact-oriented dispositionof the issue of who may [be liable for] a damages claim for
violation of Rule 10b-5" is not a "satisfactory basis for a ruleof liability imposed on the conduct of business transactions."

shares, 501 U. S., at 1106 ("The issues would be hazy, theirlitigation protracted, and their resolution unreliable. Given

a choice, we would reject any theory . . . that raised suchprospects"). Because of the uncertainty of the governing
rules, entities subject to secondary liability as aiders and
abettors may find it prudent and necessary, as a businessjudgment, to abandon substantial defenses and to pay settlements in order to avoid the expense and risk of going to trial.In addition, "litigation under Rule 10b-5 presents a danger of vexatiousness different in degree and in kind fromthat which accompanies litigation in general."

Blue Chip
Stamps, supra, at 739; see Virginia Bankshares, supra, at
1105; S. Rep. No. 792, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., p. 21 (1934) (attorney's fees provision is protection against strike suits). Litigation under 10b-5 thus requires secondary actors to expend
large sums even for pretrial defense and the negotiation of
settlements. See 138 Cong. Rec. S12605 (Aug. 12, 1992) (remarks of Sen. Sanford) (asserting that in 83% of 10b-5 cases
major accounting firms pay $8 in legal fees for every $1 paid
in claims).

This uncertainty and excessive litigation can have ripple
effects. For example, newer and smaller companies may
find it difficult to obtain advice from professionals. A professional may fear that a newer or smaller company may not
survive and that business failure would generate securities
litigation against the professional, among others. In addition, the increased costs incurred by professionals because of
the litigation and settlement costs under 10b-5 may be
passed on to their client companies, and in turn incurred by
the company's investors, the intended beneficiaries of the
statute. See Winter, Paying Lawyers, Empowering Prosecutors, and Protecting Managers: Raising the Cost of Capital
in America, 42 Duke L. J. 945, 948-966 (1993).

We hasten to add that competing policy arguments in favor
of aiding and abetting liability can also be advanced. The
point here, however, is that it is far from clear that Congress

Opinion of the Court

in 1934 would have decided that the statutory purposeswould be furthered by the imposition of private aider and

abettor liability. D

At oral argument, the SEC suggested that 18 U. S. C. $ 2is "significant" and "very important" in this case. Tr. of
Oral Arg. 41, 43. At the outset, we note that this contentionis inconsistent with the SEC's argument that recklessness is
a sufficient scienter for aiding and abetting liability. Crimi-nal aiding and abetting liability under $ 2 requires proof that
the defendant "in some sort associate[d] himself with theventure, that he participate[d] in it as in something that he
wishe[d] to bring about, that he [sought] by his action tomake it succeed."

Nye & Nissen, 336 U. S., at 619 (internalquotation marks omitted). But recklessness, not intentional

wrongdoing, is the theory underlying the aiding and abettingallegations in the case before us.

Furthermore, while it is true that an aider and abettor of acriminal violation of any provision of the 1934 Act, including

$ 10(b), violates 18 U. S. C. $ 2, it does not follow that a pri-vate civil aiding and abetting cause of action must also exist.
We have been quite reluctant to infer a private right of ac-tion from a criminal prohibition alone; in

Cort v. Ash, 422U. S. 66, 80 (1975), for example, we refused to infer a private

right of action from "a bare criminal statute." And we havenot suggested that a private right of action exists for all
injuries caused by violations of criminal prohibitions. See
Touche Ross, 442 U. S., at 568 ("[Q]uestion of the existenceof a statutory cause of action is, of course, one of statutory

construction"). If we were to rely on this reasoning now,we would be obliged to hold that a private right of action
exists for every provision of the 1934 Act, for it is a criminalviolation to violate any of its provisions. 15 U. S. C. $ 78ff.
And thus, given 18 U. S. C. $ 2, we would also have to holdthat a civil aiding and abetting cause of action is available
for every provision of the Act. There would be no logical

Opinion of the Court
stopping point to this line of reasoning: Every criminal stat-ute passed for the benefit of some particular class of persons

would carry with it a concomitant civil damages cause ofaction.

This approach, with its far-reaching consequences, wouldwork a significant shift in settled interpretive principles regarding implied causes of action. See, e. g., Transamerica
Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U. S. 11 (1979). Weare unwilling to reverse course in this case. We decline to

rely only on 18 U. S. C. $ 2 as the basis for recognizing a pri-vate aiding and abetting right of action under $ 10(b).

V
Because the text of $ 10(b) does not prohibit aiding andabetting, we hold that a private plaintiff may not maintain

an aiding and abetting suit under $ 10(b). The absence of$ 10(b) aiding and abetting liability does not mean that secondary actors in the securities markets are always free fromliability under the securities Acts. Any person or entity,
including a lawyer, accountant, or bank, who employs a ma-nipulative device or makes a material misstatement (or omission) on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies maybe liable as a primary violator under 10b-5, assuming

all ofthe requirements for primary liability under Rule 10b-5 are

met. See Fischel, 69 Calif. L. Rev., at 107-108. In anycomplex securities fraud, moreover, there are likely to be
multiple violators; in this case, for example, respondentsnamed four defendants as primary violators. App. 24-25.

Respondents concede that Central Bank did not commit amanipulative or deceptive act within the meaning of $ 10(b).
Tr. of Oral Arg. 31. Instead, in the words of the complaint,Central Bank was "secondarily liable under $ 10(b) for its
conduct in aiding and abetting the fraud." App. 26. Be-cause of our conclusion that there is no private aiding and
abetting liability under $ 10(b), Central Bank may not be heldliable as an aider and abettor. The District Court's grant

of summary judgment to Central Bank was proper, and thejudgment of the Court of Appeals is

Reversed.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Blackmun, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

The main themes of the Court's opinion are that the textof $ 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange

Act), 15 U. S. C. $ 78j(b), does not expressly mention aidingand abetting liability, and that Congress knows how to legislate. Both propositions are unexceptionable, but neither isreason to eliminate the private right of action against aiders
and abettors of violations of $ 10(b) and the Securities andExchange Commission's (SEC's) Rule 10b-5. Because the
majority gives short shrift to a long history of aider andabettor liability under $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, and because
its rationale imperils other well-established forms of second-ary liability not expressly addressed in the securities laws, I
respectfully dissent.In

hundreds of judicial and administrative proceedings inevery Circuit in the federal system, the courts and the SEC

have concluded that aiders and abettors are subject to lia-bility under $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. See 5B A. Jacobs, Litigation and Practice Under Rule 10b-5 $ 40.02 (rev. ed.1993) (citing cases). While we have reserved decision on the
legitimacy of the theory in two cases that did not present it,all 11 Courts of Appeals to have considered the question
have recognized a private cause of action against aiders andabettors under $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.

and abetting decisions relied upon principles borrowed from
tort law; in those cases, judges closer to the times and climate of the 73d Congress than we concluded that holding
aiders and abettors liable was consonant with the Exchange
Act's purpose to strengthen the antifraud remedies of the
common law.2 One described the aiding and abetting theory,
grounded in "general principles of tort law," as a "logical
and natural complement" to the private $ 10(b) action that
furthered the Exchange Act's purpose of "creation and maintenance of a post-issuance securities market that is free from
fraudulent practices." Brennan v. Midwestern United Life
Ins. Co., 259 F. Supp. 673, 680 (ND Ind. 1966) (borrowing

Diamanthuset, Inc., 950 F. 2d 1478, 1483 (CA9 1991); Farlow v. Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., 956 F. 2d 982, 986 (CA10 1992); Schneberger v.
Wheeler, 859 F. 2d 1477, 1480 (CA11 1988). The only court not to have
squarely recognized aiding and abetting in private $ 10(b) actions has done
so in an action brought by the SEC, see Dirks v. SEC, 681 F. 2d 824, 844
(CADC), rev'd on other grounds, 463 U. S. 646 (1983), and has suggested
that such a claim was available in private actions, see Zoelsch v. Arthur
Andersen & Co., 824 F. 2d 27, 35-36 (CADC 1987). The Seventh Circuit's
test differs markedly from the other Circuits' in that it requires that the
aider and abettor "commit one of the `manipulative or deceptive' acts prohibited under section 10(b) and rule 10b-5." Robin v. Arthur Young &
Co., 915 F. 2d 1120, 1123 (CA7 1990).

2 When $ 10(b) was enacted, aiding and abetting liability was widely, albeit not universally, recognized in the law of torts and in state legislation
prohibiting misrepresentation in the marketing of securities. See, e. g., 1
T. Cooley, Law of Torts 244 (3d ed. 1906) ("All who actively participate in
any manner in the commission of a tort, or who command, direct, advise,
encourage, aid or abet its commission, are jointly and severally liable
therefor"). Section 16(1) of the Uniform Sale of Securities Act, 9 U. L. A.
385 (1932), conferred a right to sue aiders and abettors of securities fraud,
as did the blue sky laws of 11 States. See Abrams, The Scope of Liability
Under Section 12 of the Securities Act of 1933: "Participation" and the
Pertinent Legislative Materials, 15 Ford. Urb. L. J. 877, 945 (1987). The
courts' reliance on common-law tort principles in defining the scope of
liability under $ 10(b) was by no means an anomaly. See, e. g., American
Soc. of Mechanical Engineers, Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corp., 456 U. S. 556,
565-574 (1982).

formulation from the Restatement of Torts $ 876(b) (1939)),
later opinion, 286 F. Supp. 702 (1968), aff 'd, 417 F. 2d 147

Pettit v. American Stock Exchange, 217 F. Supp. 21, 28
(SDNY 1963).

The Courts of Appeals have usually applied a familiar
three-part test for aider and abettor liability, patterned on
the Restatement of Torts formulation, that requires (i) the
existence of a primary violation of $ 10(b) or Rule 10b-5, (ii)
the defendant's knowledge of (or recklessness as to) that primary violation, and (iii) "substantial assistance" of the violation by the defendant. See, e. g., Cleary v. Perfectune, Inc.,
700 F. 2d 774, 776-777 (CA1 1983); IIT, An Int'l Investment
Trust v. Cornfeld, 619 F. 2d 909, 922 (CA2 1980). If indeed
there has been "continuing confusion" concerning the private
right of action against aiders and abettors, that confusion has
not concerned its basic structure, still less its "existence."
See ante, at 170. Indeed, in this case, petitioner assumed
the existence of a right of action against aiders and abettors,
and sought review only of the subsidiary questions whether
an indenture trustee could be found liable as an aider and
abettor absent a breach of an indenture agreement or other
duty under state law, and whether it could be liable as an
aider and abettor based only on a showing of recklessness.
These questions, it is true, have engendered genuine disagreement in the Courts of Appeals.3 But instead of simply
addressing the questions presented by the parties, on which
the law really was unsettled, the Court sua sponte directed

in cases in which defendant has no disclosure duty, 969 F. 2d 891, 902-903

the parties to address a question on which even the petitioner justifiably thought the law was settled, and reaches
out to overturn a most considerable body of precedent.4

Many of the observations in the majority's opinion would
be persuasive if we were considering whether to recognize a
private right of action based upon a securities statute
enacted recently. Our approach to implied causes of action,
as to other matters of statutory construction, has changed
markedly since the Exchange Act's passage in 1934. At that
time, and indeed until quite recently, courts regularly assumed, in accord with the traditional common-law presumption, that a statute enacted for the benefit of a particular
class conferred on members of that class the right to sue
violators of that statute.5 Moreover, shortly before the Exchange Act was passed, this Court instructed that such
"remedial" legislation should receive "a broader and more
liberal interpretation than that to be drawn from mere dictionary definitions of the words employed by Congress."
Piedmont & Northern R. Co. v. ICC, 286 U. S. 299, 311

current approach to implied causes of action, ante, at 176-
177, to a statute enacted when courts commonly read stat4 "As I have said before, `the adversary process functions most effectively when we rely on the initiative of lawyers, rather than the activism

utes of this kind broadly to accord with their remedial purposes and regularly approved rights to sue despite statutory
silence.

Even had $ 10(b) not been enacted against a backdrop of
liberal construction of remedial statutes and judicial favor
toward implied rights of action, I would still disagree with
the majority for the simple reason that a "settled construction of an important federal statute should not be disturbed
unless and until Congress so decides." Reves v. Ernst &

policy of respect for consistent judicial and administrative
interpretations leaves it to elected representatives to assess
settled law and to evaluate the merits and demerits of changing it.7 Even when there is no affirmative evidence of rati6 None of the cases the majority relies upon to support its strict construction of $ 10(b), ante, at 173-175, even arguably involved a settled

7 Of course, when a decision of this Court upsets settled law, Congress

may step in to reinstate the old law, cf. Securities Exchange Act $ 27A, as
added by Pub. L. 102-242, $ 476, 105 Stat. 2236, 2387, codified at 15 U. S. C.

full plate. Moreover, congressional efforts to address the problems posed
by judicial decisions that disrupt settled law frequently create special difficulties of their own. See, e. g., Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 1 F. 3d

Here, however, the available evidence suggests congressional
approval of aider and abettor liability in private $ 10(b) ac-tions. In its comprehensive revision of the Exchange Act in

Ins. Co., 259 F. Supp. 673, 680 (ND Ind. 1966), had been on the books
almost a decade and several Courts of Appeals had recognized aider and
abettor liability in private actions brought under $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.
See Kerbs v. Fall River Industries, Inc., 502 F. 2d 731, 739-740 (CA10

Defendants in Securities Law Fraud Cases: Aiding and Abetting, Conspiracy, In Pari Delicto, Indemnification, and Contribution, 120 U. Pa. L.
Rev. 597, 620-638 (1972). We have noted the significance of the 1975
amendments in another case involving a "consistent line of judicial
decisions" on the implied right of action under $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.
See Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U. S. 375, 384-386 (1983).
Those amendments emerged from " `the most searching reexamination of
the competitive, statutory, and economic issues facing the securities markets, the securities industry, and, of course, public investors, since the
1930's.' " Id., at 385, n. 20 (quoting H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 94-229, p. 91

Congress' more recent visits to the securities laws also suggest approval
of the aiding and abetting theory in private $ 10(b) actions. The House

and abetting liability intact draws further strength from the
fact that the SEC itself has consistently understood $ 10(b)
to impose aider and abettor liability since shortly after the
rule's promulgation. See Ernst & Young, 494 U. S., at 75
(Stevens, J., concurring). In short, one need not agree as
an original matter with the many decisions recognizing the
private right against aiders and abettors to concede that the
right fits comfortably within the statutory scheme, and that
it has become a part of the established system of private
enforcement. We should leave it to Congress to alter that
scheme.

The Court would be on firmer footing if it had been shown
that aider and abettor liability "detracts from the effectiveness of the 10b-5 implied action or interferes with the effective operation of the securities laws." See Musick, Peeler &
Garrett v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, 508 U. S. 286, 298
(1993). However, the line of decisions recognizing aider and
abettor liability suffers from no such infirmities. The language of both $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 encompasses "any person" who violates the Commission's antifraud rules, whether
"directly or indirectly"; we have read this "broad" language
"not technically and restrictively, but flexibly to effectuate
its remedial purposes." Affiliated Ute Citizens of Utah v.
United States, 406 U. S. 128, 151 (1972). In light of the encompassing language of $ 10(b), and its acknowledged purpose to strengthen the antifraud remedies of the common
law, it was certainly no wild extrapolation for courts to
conclude that aiders and abettors should be subject to the

Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988, Pub. L.
100-704, 102 Stat. 4681, contains an express "acknowledgment," Musick,

private action under $ 10(b).9 Allowing aider and abettorclaims in private $ 10(b) actions can hardly be said to impose

unfair legal duties on those whom Congress has opted toleave unregulated: Aiders and abettors of $ 10(b) and Rule
10b-5 violations have always been subject to criminal liabil-ity under 18 U. S. C. $ 2. See 15 U. S. C. $ 78ff (criminal liability for willful violations of securities statutes and rulespromulgated under them). Although the Court canvasses
policy arguments against aider and abettor liability, ante, at188-190, it does not suggest that the aiding and abetting theory has had such deleterious consequences that we shoulddispense with it on those grounds.

10 The agency charged

with primary responsibility for enforcing the securities lawsdoes not perceive such drawbacks, and urges retention of the

private right to sue aiders and abettors. See Brief for SECas

Amicus Curiae 5-17.As framed by the Court's order redrafting the questions

presented, this case concerns only the existence and scope ofaiding and abetting liability in suits brought by private parties under $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. The majority's rationale,

9 In a similar context we recognized a private right of action against
secondary violators of a statutory duty despite the absence of a provision
explicitly covering them. See Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith,
Inc. v. Curran, 456 U. S., at 394 ("Having concluded that exchanges can
be held accountable for breaching their statutory duties to enforce their
own rules prohibiting price manipulation, it necessarily follows that those
persons who are participants in a conspiracy to manipulate the market in
violation of those rules are also subject to suit by futures traders who can
prove injury from these violations").

10 Indeed, the Court anticipates, ante, at 191, that many aiders and abettors will be subject to liability as primary violators. For example, an
accountant, lawyer, or other person making oral or written misrepresentations (or omissions, if the person owes a duty to the injured purchaser or
seller, cf. Dirks v. SEC, 463 U. S. 646, 654-655 (1983)) in connection with
the purchase or sale of securities may be liable for a primary violation of

$ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. See, e. g., Akin v. Q-L Investments, Inc., 959
F. 2d 521, 525-526 (CA5 1992).

however, sweeps far beyond even those important issues.The majority leaves little doubt that the Exchange Act does

not even permit the SEC to pursue aiders and abettors incivil enforcement actions under $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. See
ante, at 177 (finding it dispositive that "the text of the 1934Act does not itself reach those who aid and abet a $ 10(b)
violation"). Aiding and abetting liability has a long pedi-gree in civil proceedings brought by the SEC under $ 10(b)
and Rule 10b-5, and has become an important part of theSEC's enforcement arsenal.

11 Moreover, the majority's approach to aiding and abetting at the very least casts seriousdoubt, both for private and SEC actions, on

other forms ofsecondary liability that, like the aiding and abetting theory,

have long been recognized by the SEC and the courts butare not expressly spelled out in the securities statutes.

11 See, e. g., SEC v. Coffey, 493 F. 2d 1304, 1316 (CA6 1974); Ruder, 120
U. Pa. L. Rev., at 625-626, nn. 124 and 125. The SEC reports that it
asserted aiding and abetting claims in 15 percent of its civil enforcement
proceedings in fiscal year 1992, and that elimination of aiding and abetting
liability would "sharply diminish the effectiveness of Commission actions."
Brief for SEC as Amicus Curiae 18, n. 15.

12 The Court's rationale would sweep away the decisions recognizing

that a defendant may be found liable in a private action for conspiring to
violate $ 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. See, e. g., U. S. Industries, Inc. v. Touche
Ross & Co., 854 F. 2d 1223, 1231 (CA10 1988); SEC v. Coffey, 493 F. 2d

sub nom. Bard v. Dasho, 389 U. S. 977 (1967). See generally Kuehnle, 14
J. Corp. L., at 343-348. Secondary liability is as old as the implied right
of action under $ 10(b) itself; the very first decision to recognize a private
cause of action under the section and rule, Kardon v. National Gypsum
Co., 69 F. Supp. 512 (ED Pa. 1946), involved an alleged conspiracy. See
also Fry v. Schumaker, 83 F. Supp. 476, 478 (ED Pa. 1947) (Kirkpatrick,
C. J.). In addition, many courts, concluding that $ 20(a)'s "controlling person" provisions, 15 U. S. C. $ 78t, are not the exclusive source of secondary
liability under the Exchange Act, have imposed liability in $ 10(b) actions
based upon respondeat superior and other common-law agency principles.

Stevens, J., dissenting
The principle the Court espouses today--that liability maynot be imposed on parties who are not within the

scope of $ 10(b)'s plain language--is inconsistent with long-established SEC and judicial precedent.

As a general principle, I agree, "the creation of new rightsought to be left to legislatures, not courts."

Musick, Peeler,508 U. S., at 291. But judicial restraint does not always

favor the narrowest possible interpretation of rights derivedfrom federal statutes. While we are now properly reluctant
to recognize private rights of action without an instructionfrom Congress, we should also be reluctant to lop off rights
of action that have been recognized for decades, even if thejudicial methodology that gave them birth is now out of
favor. Caution is particularly appropriate here, because thejudicially recognized right in question accords with the longstanding construction of the agency Congress has assignedto enforce the securities laws. Once again the Court has
refused to build upon a " `secure foundation . . . laid byothers,' "

McDERMOTT, INC. v. AmCLYDE et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 92-1479. Argued January 11, 1994--Decided April 20, 1994
When petitioner McDermott, Inc., attempted to use a crane purchased

from respondent AmClyde to move an offshore oil and gas production
platform, a prong of the crane's hook broke, damaging both the platform
and the crane itself. The malfunction may have been caused by McDermott's negligent operation of the crane, by AmClyde's faulty design or
construction, by a defect in the hook supplied by respondent River Don
Castings, Ltd., or by one or more of the three companies that supplied
supporting steel slings. McDermott brought suit in admiralty against
respondents and the three "sling defendants," but settled with the latter
for $1 million. The case then went to trial, and the jury assessed McDermott's loss at $2.1 million, allocating 32% of the damages to AmClyde, 38% to River Don, and 30% jointly to petitioner and the sling
defendants. Among other things, the District Court entered judgment
against AmClyde for $672,000 (32% of $2.1 million) and against River
Don for $798,000 (38% of $2.1 million). Holding that the contract between McDermott and AmClyde precluded any recovery against the
latter and that the trial judge had improperly denied respondents' motion to reduce the judgment against them pro tanto by the settlement
amount, the Court of Appeals reversed the judgment against AmClyde
entirely and reduced the judgment against River Don to $470,000, which
it computed by determining McDermott's full award to be $1.47 million
($2.1 million minus 30% attributed to McDermott/sling defendants), and
then by deducting the $1 million settlement.

Held: The nonsettling defendants' liability should be calculated with reference to the jury's allocation of proportionate responsibility, not by giving
them a credit for the dollar amount of the settlement. Pp. 207-221.

(a) Supported by a consensus among maritime nations, scholars, and
judges, the Court, in United States v. Reliable Transfer Co., 421 U. S.
397, 409, adopted a rule requiring that damages in an admiralty suit be
assessed on the basis of proportionate fault when such an allocation
can reasonably be made. No comparable consensus has developed with
respect to the issue in this case. Although it is generally agreed that
nonsettling joint tortfeasors are entitled to a credit when the plaintiff
settles with one of the other defendants, there is a divergence of views

203Cite as: 511 U. S. 202 (1994)

about how that credit should be determined. The American Law Institute (ALI) has identified three principal alternatives for doing so: (1)
pro tanto setoff with a right of contribution against the settling defendant; (2) pro tanto setoff without contribution; and (3) the "proportionate
share approach," whereby the settlement diminishes the injured party's
claim against nonsettling tortfeasors by the amount of the equitable
share of the obligation of the settling tortfeasor. Pp. 207-211.

(b) ALI Option 3, the proportionate share approach, best answers the
question presented in this case. Option 1 is clearly inferior to the other
two alternatives, because it discourages settlement and leads to unnecessary ancillary litigation. As between Options 2 and 3, the proportionate share approach is more consistent with the proportionate fault
approach of Reliable Transfer, supra, because a litigating defendant ordinarily pays only its proportionate share of the judgment. Conversely,
Option 2, even when supplemented with hearings to determine the good
faith of the settlement, is likely to lead to inequitable apportionments of
liability, contrary to Reliable Transfer. Moreover, although Option 2
sometimes seems to better promote settlement than Option 3, it must
ultimately be seen to have no clear advantage in that regard, since,
under the proportionate share approach, factors such as the parties' desire to avoid litigation costs, to reduce uncertainty, and to maintain ongoing commercial relationships should ensure nontrial dispositions in
the vast majority of cases. Similarly, Option 2 has no clear advantage
with respect to judicial economy unless it is adopted without the requirement of a good-faith hearing, a course which no party or amicus
advocates because of the large potential for unfairness to nonsettling
defendants, who might have to pay more than their fair share of the
damages. Pp. 211-217.

(c) Respondents' argument that the proportionate share approach violates the "one satisfaction rule"--which, as applied by some courts,
reduces a plaintiff's recovery against a nonsettling defendant in order
to ensure that the plaintiff does not secure more than necessary to compensate him for his loss--is rejected, since the law contains no rigid
rule against overcompensation, and, indeed, several doctrines, such as
the collateral benefits rule, recognize that making tortfeasors pay for
the damage they cause can be more important than preventing overcompensation. The argument that the proportionate share approach is inconsistent with Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 443
U. S. 256, is also rejected, since Edmonds was primarily a statutory
construction case, did not address the question at issue here or even
involve a settlement, and can be read as merely reaffirming the wellestablished principle of joint and several liability, which was in no way

A construction accident in the Gulf of Mexico gave riseto this admiralty case. In advance of trial, petitioner, the

trial. A jury assessed petitioner's loss at $2.1 million andallocated 32% of the damages to respondent AmClyde and
38% to respondent River Don Castings, Ltd. (River Don).The question presented is whether the liability of the nonsettling defendants should be calculated with reference to thejury's allocation of proportionate responsibility, or by giving
the nonsettling defendants a credit for the dollar amount ofthe settlement. We hold that the proportionate approach is

a structural steel base affixed to the floor of the Gulf of Mex-ico, a prong of the crane's main hook broke, causing massive
damage to the deck and to the crane itself. The malfunctionmay have been caused by petitioner's negligent operation of
the crane, by AmClyde's faulty design or construction, by adefect in the hook supplied by River Don, or by one or more

defendant's fault is obscure. Perhaps it thought doing so would prevent
a contribution action against the sling defendants and thus relieve McDermott of its indemnity obligation.

206 McDERMOTT, INC. v. AmCLYDE

Opinion of the Court
F. 2d 1068, 1070 (CA5 1993). The jury found that the totaldamages to the deck amounted to $2.1 million and, in answer

to special interrogatories, allocated responsibility among therespective parties: 32% to AmClyde, 38% to River Don, and
30% jointly to McDermott and the sling defendants.5 Thecourt denied a motion by respondents to reduce the judgment pro tanto by the $1 million settlement, and entered
judgment against AmClyde for $672,000 (32% of $2.1 million)and against River Don for $798,000 (38% of $2.1 million).

Even though the sum of those judgments plus the settlementproceeds exceeded the total damages found by the jury, the
District Court concluded that petitioner had not received adouble recovery because the settlement had covered both
crane damages and deck damages.6The Court of Appeals held that a contractual provision
precluded any recovery against AmClyde and that the trialjudge had improperly denied a

pro tanto settlement credit.
It reversed the judgment against AmClyde entirely and reduced the judgment against River Don to $470,000. It ar-rived at that figure by making two calculations. First, it

determined that petitioner's "full damage[s] award is $1.47million ($2.1 million jury verdict less 30% attributed to
McDermott/sling defendants)." 979 F. 2d, at 1081. Next,it deducted the "$1 million received in settlement to reach

5 The special interrogatory treated McDermott and the sling defendants
as a single entity and called for a percentage figure that covered them
both. This combined treatment reflected McDermott's acceptance of responsibility for the damages caused by the sling defendants.

6 The trial judge also noted that "[t]o hold as the defendants request

would result in the settling defendants, who were at the most thirty percent (30%) responsible for the accident (no separate contributory negligence, if any, finding was made as to McDermott), paying One Million
Dollars ($1,000,000.00) while the defendants who insisted on a trial and
were found to be seventy percent (70%) liable would pay Four Hundred

$470,000." Ibid. It treated this figure as the maximumthat could be recovered from the nonsettling defendants.

Because it was less than River Don's liability as found by thejury (38% of $2.1 million or $798,000), it directed the entry
of judgment against River Don in that amount. Ibid.

Because we have not previously considered how a settle-ment with less than all of the defendants in an admiralty

case should affect the liability of nonsettling defendants, andbecause the Courts of Appeals have adopted different approaches to this important question, we granted certiorari.509 U. S. 921 (1993).

Although Congress has enacted significant legislation in
the field of admiralty law,7 none of those statutes providesus with any "policy guidance" or imposes any limit on our

authority to fashion the rule that will best answer the ques-tion presented by this case. See

Miles v. Apex Marine
Corp., 498 U. S. 19, 27 (1990). We are, nevertheless, in famil-iar waters because "the Judiciary has traditionally taken the

lead in formulating flexible and fair remedies in the law mari-time."

United States v. Reliable Transfer Co., 421 U. S. 397,
409 (1975).

In the Reliable Transfer case we decided to abandon a
rule that had been followed for over a century in assessing
damages when both parties to a collision are at fault. We
replaced the divided damages rule, which required an equal
division of property damage whatever the relative degree of
fault may have been, with a rule requiring that damages be
assessed on the basis of proportionate fault when such an
allocation can reasonably be made. Although the old rule
avoided the difficulty of determining comparative degrees of

negligence, we concluded that it was "unnecessarily crude
and inequitable" and that "[p]otential problems of proof in
some cases hardly require adherence to an archaic and unfair
rule in all cases." Id., at 407. Thus the interest in certainty and simplicity served by the old rule was outweighed
by the interest in fairness promoted by the proportionate
fault rule.

Our decision in Reliable Transfer was supported by a consensus among the world's maritime nations and the views
of respected scholars and judges. See id., at 403-405. No
comparable consensus has developed with respect to the
issue in the case before us today. It is generally agreed that
when a plaintiff settles with one of several joint tortfeasors,
the nonsettling defendants are entitled to a credit for that
settlement. There is, however, a divergence among respected scholars and judges about how that credit should be
determined. Indeed, the American Law Institute (ALI) has
identified three principal alternatives and, after noting that
"[e]ach has its drawbacks and no one is satisfactory," decided
not to take a position on the issue. Restatement (Second)
of Torts $ 886A, pp. 343-344 (1977). The ALI describes the
three alternatives as follows:

"(1) The money paid extinguishes any claim that the
injured party has against the party released and the
amount of his remaining claim against the other tortfeasor is reached by crediting the amount received; but the
transaction does not affect a claim for contribution by
another tortfeasor who has paid more than his equitable
share of the obligation." Id., at 343.

"(2) The money paid extinguishes both any claims on
the part of the injured party and any claim for contribution by another tortfeasor who has paid more than his
equitable share of the obligation and seeks contribution." Ibid. (As in alternative (1), the amount of the

injured party's claim against the other tortfeasors is cal511us1$37I 11-03-97 17:39:47 PAGES OPINPGT

culated by subtracting the amount of the settlementfrom the plaintiff 's damages.)

"(3) The money paid extinguishes any claim that theinjured party has against the released tortfeasor and
also diminishes the claim that the injured party hasagainst the other tortfeasors by the amount of the equitable share of the obligation of the released tortfeasor."
Id., at 344.8

The first two alternatives involve the kind of "pro tanto"credit that respondents urge us to adopt. The difference

between the two versions of the pro tanto approach is therecognition of a right of contribution against a settling defendant in the first but not the second. The third alterna-tive, supported by petitioner, involves a credit for the settling defendants' "proportionate share" of responsibility forthe total obligation. Under this approach, no suits for contribution from the settling defendants are permitted, nor arethey necessary, because the nonsettling defendants pay no
more than their share of the judgment.

8 The three alternatives sketched by the ALI correspond to three detailed model Acts proposed by the National Conference of Commissioners
on Uniform State Laws. Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act
(1939 Act), 12 U. L. A. 57-59 (1975) (ALI Option 1); Revised Uniform
Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act (1955 Revised Act), id., at 63-107
(ALI Option 2); Uniform Comparative Fault Act (1977 Act), 12 U. L. A.
45-61 (1993 Supp.) (ALI Option 3). Although the three ALI options are
the most plausible, a number of others are possible. So, for example, in
addition to arguing for the pro tanto rule, respondents suggest that we
consider a rule that allows the nonsettling defendants to elect before trial
either the pro tanto or the proportionate share rule. Although respondents claim support for their proposal in Texas and New York statutes,
those statutes enact regimes quite different from that proposed by respondents. Texas Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. $ 33.012(b) (Supp. 1994)
(nonsettling defendant can choose pro tanto rule or reduction of damages
by fixed proportion of total damages without regard to relative fault); N. Y.
Gen. Oblig. Law $ 15-108 (McKinney 1989) (pro tanto rule or proportionate
share rule, whichever favors nonsettling defendants). We are unwilling
to consider a rule that has yet to be applied in any jurisdiction.

Opinion of the Court
The proportionate share approach 9 would make River Donresponsible for precisely its share of the damages, $798,000

(38% of $2.1 million).10 A simple application of the pro tantoapproach would allocate River Don $1.1 million in damages
($2.1 million total damages minus the $1 million settle-ment).

11 The Court of Appeals, however, made a different

9 In this opinion, we use the phrase "proportionate share approach" to
denote ALI Option 3. We have deliberately avoided use of the term "pro
rata," which is often used to describe this approach, see, e. g., T. Schoenbaum, Admiralty and Maritime Law $ 4-15, p. 153 (1987), because that
term is also used to describe an equal allocation among all defendants
without regard to their relative responsibility for the loss. See In re Masters Mates & Pilots Pension Plan and IRAP Litigation, 957 F. 2d 1020,
1028 (CA2 1992); Silver, Contribution Under the Securities Acts: The Pro
Rata Method Revisited, 1992/1993 Ann. Survey Am. L. 273. Others have
used different terms to describe the approach adopted here. Ibid. ("proportionate method"); Kornhauser & Revesz, Settlements Under Joint and
Several Liability, 68 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 427, 438 (1993) ("apportioned share
set-off rule"); Polinsky & Shavell, Contribution and Claim Reduction
Among Antitrust Defendants: An Economic Analysis, 33 Stan. L. Rev. 447
(1981) ("claim reduction").

10 It might be thought that, since AmClyde is immune from damages,

River Don's liability should be $1.47 million (McDermott's $2.1 million loss
minus 30% of $2.1 million, the share of liability attributed to the settling
defendants and McDermott). This calculation would make River Don
responsible not only for its own 38% share, but also for the 32% of the
damages allocated by the jury to AmClyde. This result could be seen
as mandated by principles of joint and several liability and by Edmonds
v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 443 U. S. 256 (1979). See infra,
at 220-221. Nevertheless, McDermott has not requested that River Don
pay any more than its 38% share of the damages. AmClyde is immune
from damages because its contract with McDermott provided that free
replacement of defective parts "shall constitute fulfillment of all liabilities
. . . whether based upon Contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise." 979
F. 2d 1068, 1075 (CA5 1993) (emphasis omitted). The best way of viewing
this contractual provision is as a quasi settlement in advance of any tort
claims. Viewed as such, the proportionate credit in this case properly
takes into account both the 30% of liability apportioned to the settling
defendants (and McDermott) and the 32% allocated to AmClyde. This
leaves River Don with $798,000 or 38% of the damages.

11 For simplicity, we ignore AmClyde, which was found to be immune

from damages by the Court of Appeals. Id., at 1075-1076. No party

calculation. Because McDermott "accepted responsibilityfor any part the sling played in causing the damage," 979

F. 2d, at 1070, the Court of Appeals treated the 30% of liabil-ity apportioned to "McDermott/sling defendants" as if that
30% had been caused solely by McDermott's own negligence.
Id., at 1081. The Court of Appeals, therefore, gave RiverDon a double credit, first reducing the total loss by the

McDermott/sling defendants' proportionate share andthen applying the full pro tanto reduction to that amount.
This double credit resulted in an award of only $470,000 ($2.1million minus 30% of $2.1 million minus $1 million).

III
In choosing among the ALI's three alternatives, three con-siderations are paramount: consistency with the proportionate fault approach of United States v. Reliable Transfer, 421U. S. 397 (1975), promotion of settlement, and judicial economy. ALI Option 1, pro tanto setoff with right of contribu-tion against the settling defendant, is clearly inferior to the
other two, because it discourages settlement and leads tounnecessary ancillary litigation. It discourages settlement,
because settlement can only disadvantage the settling de-fendant.

13 If a defendant makes a favorable settlement, in

appeals that holding. Although AmClyde spent a considerable amount
replacing the defective hook, River Don does not argue that that amount
should be included in the calculation of its liability.

12 Whether the Court of Appeals correctly applied the pro tanto rule in

the context of McDermott's acceptance of responsibility for the sling damages is a difficult question. Fortunately, since we adopt the proportionate
share approach, we need not answer it.

Opinion of the Court
which it pays less than the amount a court later determinesis its share of liability, the other defendant (or defendants)

can sue the settling defendant for contribution. The set-tling defendant thereby loses the benefit of its favorable settlement. In addition, the claim for contribution burdens thecourts with additional litigation. The plaintiff can mitigate
the adverse effect on settlement by promising to indemnifythe settling defendant against contribution, as McDermott
did here. This indemnity, while removing the disincentiveto settlement, adds yet another potential burden on the
courts, an indemnity action between the settling defendantand plaintiff.

The choice between ALI Options 2 and 3, between the protanto rule without contribution against the settling tortfeasor and the proportionate share approach, is less clear. Theproportionate share rule is more consistent with Reliable
Transfer, because a litigating defendant ordinarily pays onlyits proportionate share of the judgment. Under the pro
tanto approach, however, a litigating defendant's liabilitywill frequently differ from its equitable share, because a settlement with one defendant for less than its equitable sharerequires the nonsettling defendant to pay more than its
share.14 Such deviations from the equitable apportionment

14 Suppose, for example, that a plaintiff sues two defendants, each
equally responsible, and settles with one for $250,000. At trial, the nonsettling defendant is found liable, and plaintiff's damages are assessed at
$1 million. Under the pro tanto rule, the nonsettling defendant would be
liable for 75% of the damages ($750,000, which is $1 million minus
$250,000). The litigating defendant is thus responsible for far more than
its proportionate share of the damages. It is also possible for the pro
tanto rule to result in the nonsettlor paying less than its apportioned
share, if, as in this case, the settlement is greater than the amount later
determined by the court to be the settlors' equitable share. For a more
complex example illustrating the potential for unfairness under the pro
tanto rule when the parties are not equally at fault, see Kornhauser &
Revesz, 68 N. Y. U. L. Rev., at 455-456 (pro tanto rule can lead to defendant responsible for 75% of damages paying only 37.5% of loss, while 25%
responsible defendant pays 31.25%).

of damages will be common, because settlements seldom reflect an entirely accurate prediction of the outcome of a trial.
Moreover, the settlement figure is likely to be significantly
less than the settling defendant's equitable share of the loss,
because settlement reflects the uncertainty of trial and provides the plaintiff with a "war chest" with which to finance
the litigation against the remaining defendants. Courts and
legislatures have recognized this potential for unfairness and
have required "good-faith hearings" as a remedy.15 When
such hearings are required, the settling defendant is protected against contribution actions only if it shows that the
settlement is a fair forecast of its equitable share of the judgment.16 Nevertheless, good-faith hearings cannot fully remove the potential for inequitable allocation of liability.17
First, to serve their protective function effectively, such
hearings would have to be minitrials on the merits, but in
practice they are often quite cursory.18 More fundamentally,
even if the judge at a good-faith hearing were able to make
a perfect forecast of the allocation of liability at trial, there
might still be substantial unfairness when the plaintiff 's suc15 In re Masters Mates & Pilots Pension Plan and IRAP Litigation,

cess at trial is uncertain.19 In sum, the pro tanto approach,even when supplemented with good-faith hearings, is likely

to lead to inequitable apportionments of liability, contrary toReliable Transfer.

The effect of the two rules on settlements is more ambigu-ous. Sometimes the

20 This beneficial effect, however, is a conse19 Suppose again, as in footnote 14, that plaintiff sues two equally culpable defendants for $1 million and settles with one for $250,000. At the
good-faith hearing, the settling defendant persuasively demonstrates that
the settlement is in good faith, because it shows that its share of liability
is 50% and that plaintiff has only a 50% chance of prevailing at trial. The
settlement thus reflects exactly the settling defendant's expected liability.
If plaintiff prevails at trial, the nonsettling defendant will again be liable
for 75% of the judgment even though its equitable share is only 50%. The
only way to avoid this inequity is for the judge at the good-faith hearing
to disallow any settlement for less than $500,000, that is, any settlement
which takes into account the uncertainty of recovery at trial. Such a
policy, however, carries a grave cost. It would make settlement extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible, in most cases. As a result, every jurisdiction that conducts a good-faith inquiry into the amount of the settlement takes into account the uncertainty of recovery at trial. Miller, 887

20 Illustration of the beneficial effects of the pro tanto rule requires substantial simplifying assumptions. Suppose, for example, that all parties
are risk neutral, that litigation is costless, and that there are only two
defendants. In addition, suppose everyone agrees that the damages are
$100, that if one defendant is found liable, the other one will also be found
liable, and that if the defendants are liable, each will be apportioned 50%
of the damages. And suppose, as frequently happens, that the plaintiff is
more optimistic about his chances of prevailing than the defendants: Plaintiff thinks his chances of winning are 60%, whereas the defendants think
the plaintiff's chances are only 50%. In this case, under the proportionate
setoff rule, settlement is unlikely, because the plaintiff would be reluctant
to accept less than $30 (60% times 50% of $100) from each defendant,
whereas neither defendant would be disposed to offer more than $25 (50%
times 50% of $100). On the other hand, under the pro tanto rule, the
plaintiff would be willing to accept a $25 settlement offer, because he
would believe he had a 60% chance of recovering $75 ($100 minus the $25
settlement) at trial from the other defendant. Accepting the $25 settlement offer would give the plaintiff an expected recovery of $70 ($25 plus

Opinion of the Court
quence of the inequity discussed above. The rule encour-ages settlements by giving the defendant that settles first an

opportunity to pay less than its fair share of the damages,thereby threatening the nonsettling defendant with the prospect of paying more than its fair share of the loss. By disadvantaging the party that spurns settlement offers, the pro
tanto rule puts pressure on all defendants to settle.21 While
public policy wisely encourages settlements, such additional
pressure to settle is unnecessary. The parties' desire to
avoid litigation costs, to reduce uncertainty, and to maintain
ongoing commercial relationships is sufficient to ensure nontrial dispositions in the vast majority of cases.22 Under the
proportionate share approach, such factors should ensure a
similarly high settlement rate. The additional incentive to
settlement provided by the pro tanto rule comes at too high
a price in unfairness.23 Furthermore, any conclusion that
the pro tanto rule generally encourages more settlements
requires many simplifying assumptions, such as low litigation costs. Recognition of the reality that a host of practical

expect if he went to trial against both defendants. For a more thorough

The pro tanto rule, if adopted without the require-ment of a good-faith hearing, would be easier to administer,
because the relative fault 25 of the settling defendant wouldnot have to be adjudicated either at a preliminary hearing
or at trial. Nevertheless, because of the large potential forunfairness, no party or

amicus in this suit advocates the protanto rule untamed by good-faith hearings. Once the pro

share approach best promotes judicial economy. Undereither approach, the relative fault of the parties will have to

24 An excellent discussion of the effect of the various rules on settlement
is Kornhauser & Revesz, Settlement Under Joint and Several Liability, 68
N. Y. U. L. Rev. 427 (1993). After considering the effects of strategic
behavior, litigation costs, and whether the probabilities of the defendants'
being found liable at trial are "independent" or "correlated," they conclude
that "neither rule is consistently better than the other." Id., at 492. In
addition, in comparing the pro tanto and proportionate share rules, they
generally assume that the pro tanto rule is implemented without goodfaith hearings. Good-faith hearings, however, "mak[e] the pro tanto setoff rule relatively less desirable from the perspective of inducing settlements than the apportioned [i. e. proportionate] share set-off rule." Id.,
at 476. Moreover, the pro tanto rule contains a unique disincentive to
settlement in cases, like this one, in which the settlement covers more
items of damage than the litigated judgment. McDermott argued that
the settlement covered damage both to the crane and to the deck, whereas
the judgment against River Don related only to the deck. The Court of
Appeals refused to apportion the settlement between deck damages and
crane damages and to credit River Don only with that portion related to
deck damages. 979 F. 2d, at 1080. This refusal to apportion will greatly
discourage settlement, because parties like McDermott will be unable to
recover their full damages if they settle with one party.

25 By referring to the relative fault of the parties, we express no disapproval of the lower courts' use of relative "causation" to allocate damages.

be determined. Under the pro tanto approach, the settling
defendant's share of responsibility will have to be ascertained at a separate, pretrial hearing. Under the proportionate share approach, the allocation will take place at trial.
The pro tanto approach will, therefore, save judicial time
only if the good-faith hearing is quicker than the allocation
of fault at trial. Given the cursory nature of most good-faith
hearings, this may well be true. On the other hand, there
is reason to believe that reserving the apportionment of liability for trial may save more time. First, the remaining
defendant (or defendants) may settle before trial, thus making any determination of relative culpability unnecessary.
In addition, the apportionment of damages required by the
proportionate share rule may require little or no additional
trial time. The parties will often need to describe the
settling defendant's role in order to provide context for the
dispute. Furthermore, a defendant will often argue the
"empty chair" in the hope of convincing the jury that the
settling party was exclusively responsible for the damage.
The pro tanto rule thus has no clear advantage with respect
to judicial economy.26

In sum, although the arguments for the two approaches
are closely matched, we are persuaded that the proportionate share approach is superior, especially in its consistency
with Reliable Transfer.

26 A further cost of the pro tanto rule would be incurred in cases in
which the settlement covered more items of damage than the judgment.
See n. 24, supra. To avoid discouraging settlement, the judge would have
to figure out what proportion of the settlement related to damages covered
by the judgment and what percentage related to damages covered only by
the settlement. Presumably this allocation would be done by comparing
the settling defendant's liability for the damages to be covered by the
judgment to those not so covered. Ascertaining the liability of a settling
defendant for damages not otherwise litigated at trial would be at least as
difficult as ascertaining an absent defendant's responsibility for damages
already the subject of litigation.

218 McDERMOTT, INC. v. AmCLYDE

Opinion of the Court

IV
Respondents advance two additional arguments againstthe proportionate share approach: that it violates the "one

satisfaction rule" and that it is inconsistent with Edmonds v.
Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 443 U. S. 256 (1979).In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the "one satisfaction

rule" barred a plaintiff from litigating against one joint tort-feasor, if he had settled with and released another.

27 This

version of the one satisfaction rule has been thoroughly re-pudiated.

28 Respondents do not ask that the one satisfaction rule be applied with its original strictness, but rather inthe milder form in which some courts still invoke it to reduce

a plaintiff 's recovery against a nonsettling defendant in orderto ensure that the plaintiff does not secure more than necessary to compensate him for his loss.29 As a preliminary mat-ter, it is far from clear that there was any danger of supercompensatory damages here. First, there is the question ofthe crane damages, which were not covered by the judgment
against River Don. In addition, even limiting considerationto deck damages, the jury fixed plaintiff 's losses at $2.1 million. Plaintiff received $1 million in settlement from thesling defendants. Under the proportionate share approach,
plaintiff would receive an additional $798,000 from RiverDon. In total, plaintiff would recover only $1.798 million,
over $300,000 less than its damages. The one satisfactionrule comes into play only if one assumes that the percent
share of liability apportioned to McDermott and the slingdefendants really represented McDermott's contributory

Opinion of the Court
fault, and that it would be overcompensatory for McDermott
to receive more than the percentage of the total loss allocated to the defendants, here $1.47 million (70% of $2.1
million).

Even if the Court of Appeals were correct in finding that
the proportionate share approach would overcompensate McDermott, we would not apply the one satisfaction rule. The
law contains no rigid rule against overcompensation. Several doctrines, such as the collateral benefits rule,30 recognize
that making tortfeasors pay for the damage they cause can
be more important than preventing overcompensation. In
this case, any excess recovery is entirely attributable to the
fact that the sling defendants may have made an unwise settlement. It seems probable that in most cases in which
there is a partial settlement, the plaintiff is more apt to accept less than the proportionate share that the jury might
later assess against the settling defendant, because of the
uncertainty of recovery at the time of settlement negotiations and because the first settlement normally improves the
plaintiff 's litigating posture against the nonsettlors. In such
cases, the entire burden of applying a proportionate share
rule would rest on the plaintiff, and the interest in avoiding
overcompensation would be absent. More fundamentally,
we must recognize that settlements frequently result in the
plaintiff 's getting more than he would have been entitled to
at trial. Because settlement amounts are based on rough
estimates of liability, anticipated savings in litigation costs,
and a host of other factors, they will rarely match exactly

30 See 4 F. Harper, F. James, & O. Gray, Law of Torts $ 25.22 (2d ed.
1986) (injured person can recover full damages from tortfeasor, even when
he has already been made whole by insurance or other compensatory payment); Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 920A(2) (1977). The one satisfaction rule once applied to compensatory payments by nonparties as well,
thus preventing or diminishing recovery in many situations in which the
collateral benefits rules would now permit full judgment against the tortfeasor. W. Prosser, Law of Torts $ 109, pp. 1105-1107 (1941).

220 McDERMOTT, INC. v. AmCLYDE

Opinion of the Court
the amounts a trier of fact would have set. It seems to usthat a plaintiff 's good fortune in striking a favorable bargain

with one defendant gives other defendants no claim to payless than their proportionate share of the total loss. In fact,
one of the virtues of the proportionate share rule is that,unlike the

pro tanto rule, it does not make a litigating de-fendant's liability dependent on the amount of a settlement

negotiated by others without regard to its interests.Respondents also argue that the proportionate share rule
is inconsistent with Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale Trans-atlantique, 443 U. S. 256 (1979). In that case, we refused to
reduce the judgment against a shipowner by the proportion-ate fault attributed to a stevedore whose liability was limited
by the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' CompensationAct. Instead, the Court allowed the plaintiff to collect from
the shipowner the entirety of his damages, after adjustingfor the plaintiff 's own negligence. There is no inconsistency
between that result and the rule announced in this opinion.
Edmonds was primarily a statutory construction case andrelated to special interpretive questions posed by the 1972

amendments to the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers'Compensation Act. Both parties acknowledge that this case
must be resolved by judge-made rules of law. Moreover,
Edmonds did not address the issue in this case, the effect ofa settlement on nonsettling defendants. Indeed, there was

no settlement in that case. Instead, one can read that opin-ion as merely reaffirming the well-established principle of
joint and several liability. As the Court pointed out, thatprinciple was in no way abrogated by

Reliable Transfer'sproportionate fault approach. Edmonds, 443 U. S., at 271-

272, n. 30. In addition, as the Commissioners on UniformState Laws have noted, there is no tension between joint
and several liability and a proportionate share approach tosettlements.

31 Joint and several liability applies when there

Opinion of the Court
has been a judgment against multiple defendants. It canresult in one defendant's paying more than its apportioned

share of liability when the plaintiff 's recovery from other de-fendants is limited by factors beyond the plaintiff 's control,
such as a defendant's insolvency. When the limitations onthe plaintiff 's recovery arise from outside forces, joint and
several liability makes the other defendants, rather than aninnocent plaintiff, responsible for the shortfall.

Ibid.32 Un-like the rule in Edmonds, the proportionate share rule announced in this opinion applies when there has been a settle-ment. In such cases, the plaintiff 's recovery against the
settling defendant has been limited not by outside forces, butby its own agreement to settle. There is no reason to allocate any shortfall to the other defendants, who were not par-ties to the settlement. Just as the other defendants are not
entitled to a reduction in liability when the plaintiff negoti-ates a generous settlement, see

supra, at 219-220, so theyare not required to shoulder disproportionate liability when

the plaintiff negotiates a meager one.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, andthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with

this opinion. It is so ordered.

UNITED STATES v. IRVINE et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 92-1546. Argued December 6, 1993--Decided April 20, 1994
As a result of Sally Ordway Irvine's 1979 disclaimer of five-sixteenths of

her interest in the corpus of a recently terminated trust that had been
created by her grandfather in 1917, each of her five children received
one-sixteenth of her share of the distributed trust principal. Her disclaimer was effective under Minnesota law even though she had learned
of her contingent interest in the trust at least as early as 1931 when
she became 21, but the Internal Revenue Service determined that the
disclaimer brought about a gratuitous transfer that was subject to federal gift tax under Internal Revenue Code $$ 2501(a)(1) and 2511(a).
Mrs. Irvine died after she paid the tax and accrued interest, and respondents, representing her estate, filed this refund action. Arguing
that the transaction was not excepted from gift tax under Treasury
Regulation $ 25.2511-1(c)(2) (Regulation), the Government relied on
Jewett v. Commissioner, 455 U. S. 305, in which this Court construed
the 1958 version of the Regulation to provide that the disclaimer of a
remainder interest in a trust effects a taxable gift to the beneficiary
of the disclaimer unless the disclaimant acts within a reasonable time
after learning of the transfer that created the interest being disclaimed.
Respondents attempted to distinguish Jewett as having dealt with a
trust established in 1939, after the creation of the gift tax by the Revenue Act of 1932 (Act). The District Court ruled for respondents on
cross-motions for summary judgment. The Court of Appeals affirmed,
holding that the Regulation's express terms rendered it inapplicable to
the trust in question; that state law therefore governed, and the federal
gift tax did not apply because Mrs. Irvine's disclaimer was indisputably
valid under state law; and that taxation of the transfer effected by
the disclaimer would violate the Act's prohibition of retroactive gift
taxation.

Held: The disclaimer of a remainder interest in a trust is subject to federal gift taxation when the creation of the interest (but not the disclaimer) occurred before enactment of the gift tax. Pp. 232-242.

(a) Although the Internal Revenue Code's gift tax provisions embrace
all gratuitous transfers of property having significant value, the Regulation affords an exception by providing that a disclaimer of property

Syllabus
transferred from a decedent's estate does not result in a gift if it is
unequivocal and effective under local law, and made "within a reasonable
time after knowledge of the existence of the transfer." The Jewett
Court held that "the transfer" in the 1958 version of the Regulation
refers to the creation of the interest being disclaimed, with the "reasonable time" therefore beginning to run upon knowledge of the creation
of the trust. Pp. 232-234.

(b) If the Regulation applies to Mrs. Irvine's disclaimer, her act resulted in taxable gifts. The knowledge and capacity to act, which are
presupposed by the requirement that a tax-free disclaimer be made
within a reasonable time of the disclaimant's knowledge of the transfer
of the interest to her, were present in this instance at least as early as
Mrs. Irvine's 21st birthday in 1931. Although there is no bright-line
rule for timeliness in the absence of a statute or regulation providing
one, Mrs. Irvine's delay for at least 47 years in making her disclaimer
could not possibly be thought reasonable. Pp. 234-236.

(c) Respondents' arguments that the Regulation is inapposite by its
own terms to the facts of this case need not be resolved here, for the
result of the Regulation's inapplicability would not be, as respondents
claim, a freedom from gift taxation on a theory of borrowed state law.
State property transfer rules do not translate into federal taxation rules
because the principles underlying the two look to different objects. In
order to defeat the claims of a disclaimant's creditors in the disclaimed
property, the state rules apply the legal fiction that an effective disclaimer of a testamentary gift cancels the transfer to the disclaimant ab
initio and substitutes a single transfer from the original donor to the
disclaimant's beneficiary. In contrast, Congress enacted the gift tax as
a supplement to the federal estate tax and a means of curbing estate
tax avoidance. Since the reasons for defeating a disclaimant's creditors
would furnish no reasons for defeating the gift tax, the Court in Jewett,
supra, at 317, was undoubtedly correct to hold that Congress had not
meant to incorporate state-law fictions as touchstones of taxability when
it enacted the Act. Absent such a legal fiction, the federal gift tax is
not struck blind by a disclaimer. Pp. 236-240.

(d) Taxation of the transfer following Mrs. Irvine's disclaimer would
not violate $ 501(b) of the Act, which provided that it would "not apply
to a transfer made on or before the date of the enactment of this Act
[June 6, 1932]." Section 501 merely prohibited application of the gift
tax statute to transfers antedating the enactment of the Act; it did not
prohibit taxation where, as here, interests created before the Act were
transferred after enactment. Pp. 240-241.

In Jewett v. Commissioner, 455 U. S. 305 (1982), we con-strued the 1958 version of Treasury Regulation $ 25.2511-

1(c) to provide that the disclaimer of a remainder interestin a trust effects a taxable gift unless the disclaimant
acts within a reasonable time after learning of the transferthat created the interest. This case presents the question
whether the rule is the same, under current Treasury Regu-lation $ 25.2511-1(c)(2) (Regulation), when the creation of the
interest (but not the disclaimer) occurred before enactmentof the federal gift tax provisions of the Revenue Act of 1932.
We hold that it is. I

In 1917, Lucius P. Ordway established an irrevocable inter

unmarried surviving spouses of the children and by grand-children. The trust was to terminate upon the death of the

corpus would be distributed to Mr. Ordway's surviving
grandchildren and the issue of any grandchildren who had
died before termination. When the trust terminated on
June 27, 1979, the corpus was subject to division into 13
equal shares among 12 grandchildren living and the issue of
one who had died. Prior to distribution, on August 23, 1979,
one of the grandchildren, Sally Ordway Irvine, filed a disclaimer of five-sixteenths of her interest in the trust principal. Mrs. Irvine had learned of her contingent interest in
the trust at least as early as 1931 when she reached the age
of 21, and she had begun receiving a share of the annual trust
income after her father's death in 1966. Her disclaimer was
nonetheless effective under a Minnesota statute on the books
at the time, which permitted the disclaimer of a future interest at any time within six months of the event finally identifying the disclaimant and causing her interest to become indefeasibly fixed.1 As a result of her disclaimer, each of Mrs.
Irvine's five children received one-sixteenth of her share of
the distributed trust principal.

Mrs. Irvine reported the disclaimer in a federal gift tax
return, but did not treat it as resulting in a taxable gift.
The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined on audit

tax under Treas. Reg. $ 25.2511-1(c) 4 because it was notmade "within a reasonable time after [Mrs. Irvine's] knowledge" of her grandfather's transfer creating her interest inthe trust estate. Mrs. Irvine responded with an amended
return treating the disclaimer as a taxable gift, on which
she paid the resulting tax of $7,468,671, plus $2,086,627.51 inaccrued interest on the deficiency.

5 She then claimed a refund of the tax and interest, which the Internal Revenue
Service denied.

4 The following is the relevant text of the 1958 regulation then in effect:
"The gift tax also applies to gifts indirectly made. Thus, all transactions whereby property or property rights or interests are gratuitously
passed or conferred upon another, regardless of the means or device employed, constitute gifts subject to tax. See further $ 25.2512-8. Where
the law governing the administration of the decedent's estate gives a beneficiary, heir, or next-of-kin a right to completely and unqualifiedly refuse
to accept ownership of property transferred from a decedent (whether the
transfer is effected by the decedent's will or by the law of descent and
distribution of intestate property), a refusal to accept ownership does not
constitute the making of a gift if the refusal is made within a reasonable
time after knowledge of the existence of the transfer. The refusal must
be unequivocable [sic] and effective under the local law. There can be no
refusal of ownership of property after its acceptance. Where the local
law does not permit such a refusal, any disposition by the beneficiary, heir,
or next-of-kin whereby ownership is transferred gratuitously to another
constitutes the making of a gift by the beneficiary, heir, or next-of-kin.
In any case where a refusal is purported to relate to only a part of the
property, the determination of whether or not there has been a complete
and unqualified refusal to accept ownership will depend on all of the facts
and circumstances in each particular case, taking into account the recognition and effectiveness of such a purported refusal under the local law. In
the absence of facts to the contrary, if a person fails to refuse to accept a
transfer to him of ownership of a decedent's property within a reasonable
time after learning of the existence of the transfer, he will be presumed
to have accepted the property. . . ." Treas. Reg. $ 25.2511-1(c), 26 CFR

$ 25.2511-1(c) (1959).

5 Mrs. Irvine was also assessed additional gift tax and penalties in connection with an unrelated gift made in 1980 because her amended gift tax
return for the third quarter of 1979 reduced the amount of unified credit
available to her in the following year. See 26 U. S. C. $ 2505 (1988 ed. and
Supp. IV). That assessment is not at issue here.

Opinion of the Court
After Mrs. Irvine's death in 1987, respondents, represent-ing her estate, filed this action for refund of the tax and

interest in the United States District Court for the Districtof Minnesota. The Government continued to maintain that
the partial disclaimer brought about a transfer subject tofederal gift tax because Mrs. Irvine had not made it, as the
Regulation requires, "within a reasonable time after knowl-edge of the [earlier] transfer" that created her interest in the
trust estate. The Government relied on Jewett v. Commissioner, 455 U. S. 305 (1982), in which this Court held that the"transfer" referred to in Treas. Reg. $ 25.2511-1(c), 26 CFR

$ 25.2511-1(c) (1959) (promulgated in 1958), knowledge ofwhich starts the clock ticking, occurs at the creation of the
interest being disclaimed, not when its extent is finally ascer-tained or it becomes possessory.

Jewett, supra, at 311-312.Respondents tried to distinguish Jewett as having dealt

with a trust established in 1939, after the creation of the gifttax by the Revenue Act of 1932 (Act), whereas the Ordway
trust had been created before the Act, in 1917. Respond-ents also argued that the "reasonable time" limitation did
not apply because the pre-Act, 1917 transfer creating thetrust was not a "taxable transfer" of an interest, absent
which the Regulation was inapplicable.6 On cross-motions

6 The 1958 version of the Regulation was in force throughout the period
from Mrs. Irvine's disclaimer to her unsuccessful claim for a refund. The
parties agree, however, that the current (1986) version of the Regulation
supersedes the earlier version and governs this case. See 26 U. S. C.

$ 7805(b) (Secretary of the Treasury "may prescribe the extent, if any, to
which any ruling or regulation, relating to the internal revenue laws, shall
be applied without retroactive effect"); Automobile Club of Mich. v. Commissioner, 353 U. S. 180, 184 (1957) (Treasury Regulations may be retroactively applied unless doing so constitutes an abuse of the Secretary's
discretion).

The relevant regulation is now Treas. Reg. $ 25.2511-1(c)(2), 26 CFR

$ 25.2511-1(c)(2) (1993), which provides in relevant part:

"In the case of taxable transfers creating an interest in the person disclaiming made before January 1, 1977, where the law governing the administration of the decedent's estate gives a beneficiary, heir, or next-of-kin a
right completely and unqualifiedly to refuse to accept ownership of prop511us1$39M 11-03-97 17:42:53 PAGES OPINPGT
230 UNITED STATES v. IRVINE

Opinion of the Court
for summary judgment, the District Court held that impos-ing the gift tax on Mrs. Irvine's disclaimer would amount to

retroactive application of the gift tax in violation of the Act'sprovision that "[t]he tax shall not apply to a transfer made
on or before the date of the enactment of this Act [June 6,1932]." Revenue Act of 1932, ch. 209, $ 501(b), 47 Stat. 245.
The District Court cited Ordway v. United States, 89-1USTC || 13,802 (1989), in which the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Florida had reached thesame conclusion, on virtually identical facts, in a case involving a partial disclaimer by another beneficiary of theOrdway trust.

A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the EighthCircuit reversed. 936 F. 2d 343 (1991). It rejected the
view that the Regulation is inapplicable to a trust createdbefore enactment of the gift tax statute simply because the
Regulation reaches only " `taxable transfers creating aninterest in the person disclaiming made before January 1,
1977.' " Id., at 347 (emphasis in original). The Court ofAppeals held that the transfer creating the trust was "taxerty transferred from a decedent (whether the transfer is effected by the
decedent's will or by the law of descent and distribution), a refusal to
accept ownership does not constitute the making of a gift if the refusal is
made within a reasonable time after knowledge of the existence of the
transfer. The refusal must be unequivocal and effective under the local
law. There can be no refusal of ownership of property after its acceptance. In the absence of the facts to the contrary, if a person fails to refuse
to accept the transfer to him of ownership of a decedent's property within
a reasonable time after learning of the existence of the transfer, he will
be presumed to have accepted the property. Where the local law does
not permit such a refusal, any disposition by the beneficiary, heir, or nextof-kin whereby ownership is transferred gratuitously to another constitutes the making of a gift by the beneficiary, heir, or next-of-kin. In any
case where a refusal is purported to relate to only a part of the property,

completed gift for Federal gift tax purposes regardless ofwhether a gift tax is imposed on the completed gift.' " 936
F. 2d, at 347-348. The court adopted the reasoning of its
sister court for the Eleventh Circuit in Ordway v. United
States, 908 F. 2d 890 (1990), which held that a "taxable transfer" occurs within the meaning of the Regulation wheneverthere is " `any transaction in which an interest in property is

gratuitously passed or conferred upon another,' even if thattransaction was not subject to the gift tax."

Id., at 895
(citation omitted). Applying the Regulation, the Court of
Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that Mrs. Irvine's disclaimer was subject to gift tax because she did not make it
within a reasonable time after she learned of her interest in
the trust. Finally, the divided panel also upheld application
of the Act against the claim of retroactivity, holding it to be
irrelevant that the trust antedated the 1932 enactment of the
Act, since the tax was being imposed on the transfer brought
about by the 1979 disclaimer, not on the inter vivos transfer
that created the trust in 1917. 936 F. 2d, at 346.

Respondents' suggestion for rehearing en banc was
granted, however, and the panel opinion was vacated. Unlike the panel, the en banc court affirmed the District Court,
holding the Regulation inapplicable because its terms expressly limit its scope to "taxable transfers . . . made before
January 1, 1977." 981 F. 2d 991 (CA8 1992). The creation
of the Ordway trust in 1917 was not a "taxable transfer," the
court reasoned, because the federal gift tax provisions had
yet to be enacted: "It is fundamental that for a transfer to
be taxable there must be an applicable tax in existence when
the transfer is made. No such federal tax existed on January 16, 1917, when . . . Mrs. Irvine's interest was created."
Id., at 994. Given the inapplicability of the Regulation and
its "reasonable time" requirement for tax-free disclaimer, the
majority held that state law governed the effect of a dis511us1$39M 11-03-97 17:42:53 PAGES OPINPGT

valid under Minnesota law, the court held that the federalgift tax did not apply. Finally, the majority rejected the
panel's analysis of retroactive application, indicating thattaxation of the transfer effected by the disclaimer would violate the Act's prohibition of retroactive gift taxation. Id.,at 994.

In a concurring opinion, id., at 996-998, Judge Loken alsoconcluded the Regulation was inapplicable, not because of its
limitation to "taxable transfers," but because it is limited tointerests in "property transferred from a decedent . . . by
the decedent's will or by the law of descent and distribution,"whereas the Ordway trust came from an inter vivos transfer.
Judge Loken shared the majority view, however, that be-cause the Regulation was inapplicable, the federal gift tax
consequences of the disclaimer were a function of state law.The dissent took the position of the majority in the panel
opinion, and of the Eleventh Circuit in Ordway v. United
States, supra. See 981 F. 2d, at 998-1002.The conflict prompted us to grant certiorari to determine

whether a disclaimer made after enactment of the gift taxstatute, of an interest created before enactment, is necessarily free of any consequent federal gift taxation. 508 U. S.971 (1993). We hold that it is not, and reverse.

phasized that this comprehensive language was chosen toembrace all gratuitous transfers, by whatever means, of

property and property rights of significant value. See, e. g.,
Dickman v. Commissioner, 465 U. S. 330, 333-335 (1984);
Jewett v. Commissioner, 455 U. S., at 309-310; Smith v.
Shaughnessy, 318 U. S. 176, 180 (1943). We held in Jewett,
supra, at 310, that "the statutory language . . . unquestionably encompasses an indirect transfer, effected by meansof a disclaimer, of a contingent future interest in a trust,"

the practical effect of such a transfer being "to reduce theexpected size of [the taxpayer's] taxable estate and to confer
a gratuitous benefit upon the natural objects of [her]bounty . . . ."

Treasury Reg. $ 25.2511-1(c)(1) 9 restates the gift tax'sbroad scope by providing that the tax is payable on "any
transaction in which an interest in property is gratuitouslypassed or conferred upon another, regardless of the means
or device employed . . . ." The Regulation (subsection
1(c)(2)), on the other hand, affords an exception to the general rule of taxability, by providing that a disclaimer of property transferred by a decedent's will or the law of descent
and distribution does not result in a gift if it is unequivocal
and effective under local law, and made "within a reasonable
time after knowledge of the existence of the transfer." As

9 "The gift tax also applies to gifts indirectly made. Thus, any transaction in which an interest in property is gratuitously passed or conferred
upon another, regardless of the means or device employed, constitutes a
gift subject to tax. See further $ 25.2512-8 relating to transfers for insufficient consideration. However, in the case of a taxable transfer creating
an interest in the person disclaiming made after December 31, 1976, this
paragraph (c)(1) shall not apply to the donee if, as a result of a qualified
disclaimer by the donee, the property passes to a different donee. Nor
shall it apply to a donor if, as a result of a qualified disclaimer by the
donee, a completed transfer of an interest in property is not effected. See

234 UNITED STATES v. IRVINE

Opinion of the Court
already noted, the Jewett Court held that "the transfer" inthe 1958 version of the Regulation refers to the creation of

the interest being disclaimed, with the "reasonable time"therefore beginning to run upon knowledge of the creation
of the trust. See supra, at 229.

III

A
On one point there cannot be any serious dispute, for it isclear that if the Regulation applies to Mrs. Irvine's disclaimer, her act resulted in taxable gifts. The knowledgeand capacity to act, which are presupposed by the requirement that a tax-free disclaimer be made within a reasonabletime of the disclaimant's knowledge of the transfer of the
interest to her, were present in this instance at least as earlyas Mrs. Irvine's 21st birthday in 1931.

10 We need not decide

whether a disclaimer good for gift tax purposes could be re-quired to have been made before enactment of the gift tax,

for Mrs. Irvine did not disclaim shortly after enactment ofthe Act, and the timeliness determination in this case would
be the same whether the reasonable time was calculatedfrom Mrs. Irvine's first knowledge of the interest (1931) or
from the enactment of the federal gift tax statute (1932).Moreover, we understand the Government to have conceded
that it would not have contested the timeliness of a dis-claimer made within a reasonable time after the enactment
of the Act. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12.The determination of the amount of "reasonable time" that
remained after Mrs. Irvine learned of the interest andreached majority status must be based upon the gift tax's
purpose to curb avoidance of the estate tax. We have al10 Arguably, occasion and capacity occurred under applicable Minnesota
law in 1928 when Mrs. Irvine became 18 years old, the age of majority

ready observed, supra, at 233, that "the practical effect of [a
disclaimer like this one is] to reduce the expected size of [the
disclaimant's] taxable estate and to confer a gratuitous benefit upon the natural objects of [her] bounty . . . ." Jewett,
455 U. S., at 310. Accordingly, as the Court said in Jewett,
" `[a]n important, if not the main, purpose of the gift tax was
to prevent or compensate for avoidance of death taxes by
taxing the gifts of property inter vivos which, but for the
gifts, would be subject in its original or converted form
to the tax laid upon transfers at death.' " Ibid. (quoting
Estate of Sanford v. Commissioner, 308 U. S. 39, 44 (1939)).
Hence the capacious language of Internal Revenue Code

$$ 2501(a)(1) and 2511(a), which encompasses all gratuitous
transfers of property and property rights of significant value.
See supra, at 232-233.

"[T]he passage of time is crucial to the scheme of the gift
tax." Jewett, supra, at 316, n. 17 (internal quotation marks
and citation omitted). The opportunity to disclaim, and
thereby to avoid gift as well as estate taxation, should not
be so long as to provide a virtually unlimited opportunity to
consider estate planning consequences. While a decision to
disclaim even at the earliest opportunity may be made with
appreciation of potential estate tax consequences, the passage of time puts the prospective disclaimant in a correspondingly superior position to determine whether her need
to enjoy the property (and incur a tax for a subsequent gift
of it or an increased estate tax if she retains it) outweighs
the favorable estate and gift tax consequences of a disclaimer. Although there is no bright-line rule for timeliness
in the absence of a statute or regulation providing one, Mrs.
Irvine's delay for at least 47 years after the clock began running, until she reached age 68, could not possibly be thought
reasonable. By the date of her disclaimer, Mrs. Irvine was
in a position to make a fairly precise determination of the
advantage to be gained by a transfer diminishing her estate

Opinion of the Court
and its eventual taxation. If her decision were treated as
timely, the requirement for a timely election would have no
bite at all.

B

Respondents would avoid this result on two alternative
grounds. They argue first that by its own terms, the Regulation does not apply on the facts of this case, with the consequence that taxability under the Internal Revenue Code
turns on the efficacy of the disclaimer under state law. Second, respondents argue that even if the disclaimer would result in an otherwise taxable transfer in the absence of the
governing Regulation, the tax on transfer of an interest created by an instrument antedating the enactment of the gift
tax statute would be barred by the statutory prohibition of
retroactive application.

1

The question of the Regulation's applicability under its
own terms need not be resolved here, for the result of its
inapplicability would not be freedom from gift taxation on a
theory of borrowed state law or on any other rationale. The
arguments for inapplicability may therefore be shortly
stated, each having been raised at one point or another in
the prior litigation of this case.

The first argument turns on the Regulation's application
to disclaimers of interests created by what it terms "taxable
transfers," a phrase that on its face presupposes some source
of taxability for the transfer. There was, however, no gift
tax when the trust, including its remainder interests, was
created in 1917, and the gift tax provisions of the Act did
not render preenactment transfers taxable.11 The language
is, to say the least, troublesome to the Government's position
that the Regulation applies. The Government responds to

11 See Revenue Act of 1932, ch. 209, $ 501(b), 47 Stat. 245 (nonretroactivity provision).

Opinion of the Court
the trouble by citing Treas. Reg. $ 25.2518-2(c)(3) 12 (adoptedin 1986, as was the Regulation), which deals with the new

regime (not applicable here) for disclaimers of interests cre-ated after December 31, 1976,

13 and defines "taxable transfer" for its purposes as covering transfers on which no taxis actually imposed (

e. g., because a gift is chargeable againstthe current lifetime exemption, 26 U. S. C. $ 2503(b)). If this

definition is thought to beg the question, the Governmentfalls back to the argument that the predecessor regulation
was not limited in application to interests derived from tax-able transfers, and there was no intent in 1986 to narrow the
scope covered by the 1958 version of the Regulation in anysuch way.

The second argument rests on the Regulation's provisionthat "the transfer" to which it applies is subject to a timely,
tax-free disclaimer "whether the transfer is effected by thedecedent's will or by the law of descent and distribution,"
but only "where the law governing the administration of thedecedent's estate" gives the recipient of the transferred interest a right to refuse it.14 As against these descriptions ofthe transfer's testamentary character, the text says nothing
indicating that a taxable transfer from anyone other than adecedent may create an interest subject to a disclaimer free
of gift tax. If the text is given its strict reading, then, ithas no application to the interest in question here, which
came into being not from a decedent's transfer by will orfrom application of the law of descent and distribution, but

12 Treasury Reg. $ 25.2518-2(c)(3), 26 CFR $ 25.2518-2(c)(3) (1993), provides in relevant part: "With respect to inter vivos transfers, a taxable
transfer occurs when there is a completed gift for Federal gift tax purposes regardless of whether a gift tax is imposed on the completed gift."

13 Under the new regime, tax-free disclaimers of interests created by

post-1976 transfers may generally be made within nine months after the
disclaimant has learned of the interest and reached the age of 21. See 26
U. S. C. $ 2518; Treas. Reg. $$ 25.2518-1, 25.2518-2, 26 CFR $$ 25.2518-1,

Even assuming the soundness of one or both of these argu-ments that the Regulation is inapposite, however, the disclaimer would not escape federal gift taxation by referenceto state law rules giving effect to the disclaimer as causing a
transfer to the beneficiary next in line. Any such reasoningwould run counter to our holding in

Jewett. In rejecting theargument that the 1958 version of the Regulation was being

applied retroactively to the taxpayer's disadvantage in thatcase, the Jewett Court repudiated the "assumption that [the
taxpayer] had a `right' to renounce the interest without taxconsequences that was `taken away' by the 1958 Regulation.
[The taxpayer] never had such a right." Jewett, 455 U. S.,at 317. Only then did the

Jewett Court go on to determinethat the disclaimer at issue did not fall within the exemption

from the gift tax provided by the Regulation, and was conse-quently taxable. Id., at 312-316. The Court followed the
general and longstanding rule in federal tax cases that al-though state law creates legal interests and rights in property, federal law determines whether and to what extentthose interests will be taxed. See,

e. g., Burnet v. Harmel,287 U. S. 103, 110 (1932); Morgan v. Commissioner, 309 U. S.

78, 80-81 (1940); United States v. Mitchell, 403 U. S. 190, 197(1971). The Court put it this way in United States v. Pelzer,
312 U. S. 399, 402-403 (1941):

"[T]he revenue laws are to be construed in the light oftheir general purpose to establish a nationwide scheme

of taxation uniform in its application. Hence their pro15 In direct contrast, the disclaimed interest in Jewett was created by a

visions are not to be taken as subject to state control orlimitation unless the language or necessary implication

of the section involved makes its application dependenton state law."

Cases like Jewett and this one illustrate as well as any whyit is that state property transfer rules do not translate into
federal taxation rules. Under state property rules, an effec-tive disclaimer of a testamentary gift

16 is generally treated

as relating back to the moment of the original transfer of theinterest being disclaimed, having the effect of canceling the

transfer to the disclaimant ab initio and substituting a singletransfer from the original donor to the beneficiary of the disclaimer. See, e. g., Schoonover v. Osborne, 193 Iowa 474,478, 187 N. W. 20, 22 (1922);

Seifner v. Weller, 171 S. W. 2d617, 624 (Mo. 1943); Albany Hosp. v. Hanson, 214 N. Y. 435,

445, 108 N. E. 812, 815 (1915); Burritt v. Silliman, 13 N. Y.93, 97-98 (1855); Perkins v. Isley, 224 N. C. 793, 798, 32
S. E. 2d 588, 591 (1945); see also 3 American Law of Property$ 14.15 (A. Casner ed. 1952). Although a state-law right to
disclaim with such consequences might be thought to followfrom the common-law principle that a gift is a bilateral transaction, requiring not only a donor's intent to give, but also adonee's acceptance, see,

e. g., Wallace v. Moore, 219 Ga. 137,139, 132 S. E. 2d 37, 39 (1963); Gottstein v. Hedges, 210 Iowa

272, 275, 228 N. W. 93, 94 (1929); Pirie v. Le Saulnier, 161Wis. 503, 507, 154 N. W. 993, 994 (1915);

Blanchard v. Shel-don, 43 Vt. 512, 514 (1871), state-law tolerance for delay in

disclaiming reflects a less theoretical concern. An impor16 See Brown v. Routzahn, 63 F. 2d 914, 916 (CA6 1933); 3 American
Law of Property $ 14.15 (A. Casner ed. 1952). As to interests created by
intestate succession, state laws generally refused to give effect to disclaimers; the traditional rule is that "title to the property of an intestate
passes by force of the rules of law . . . and that those so entitled by law
have no power to prevent the vesting of title in themselves." Hardenbergh v. Commissioner, 198 F. 2d 63, 66 (CA8), cert. denied, 344 U. S.

240 UNITED STATES v. IRVINE

Opinion of the Court
tant consequence of treating a disclaimer as an ab initio de-feasance is that the disclaimant's creditors are barred from

reaching the disclaimed property. See, e. g., Gottstein v.Hedges, supra. The ab initio disclaimer thus operates as
a legal fiction obviating a more straightforward rule defeat-ing the claims of a disclaimant's creditors in the property
disclaimed.The principles underlying the federal gift tax treatment of
disclaimers look to different objects, however. As we havealready stated, Congress enacted the gift tax as a supplement to the estate tax and a means of curbing estate taxavoidance. See

supra, at 234-235. Since the reasons fordefeating a disclaimant's creditors would furnish no reasons

for defeating the gift tax as well, the Jewett Court was un-doubtedly correct to hold that Congress had not meant to
incorporate state-law fictions as touchstones of taxabilitywhen it enacted the Act. Absent such a legal fiction, the
federal gift tax is not struck blind by a disclaimer. Andas we have already stated,

supra, at 233, without the excep-tion afforded in the Regulation,

17 the gift tax statute provides a general rule of taxability for disclaimers such asMrs. Irvine's.

IV
Presumably to ward off any attack on the federal gift taxresting on the possibility that its retroactive application

would violate due process, see Untermyer v. Anderson, 276U. S. 440 (1928), $ 501(b) of the Act provided that it would
"not apply to a transfer made on or before the date of theenactment of this Act [June 6, 1932]." Revenue Act of 1932,
ch. 209, $ 501(b), 47 Stat. 245. The same provision has insubstance been carried forward to this day.

Opinion of the Court
otherwise be authorized, taxation of the transfer followingMrs. Irvine's disclaimer would violate this limitation. The

language that respondents use to frame this claim revealsthe flaw in their position. Respondents argue that "[t]he
government's interpretation of the 1986 Regulation to apply
to interests created before enactment of the Act [i. e., to re-sult in taxability] would be a retroactive application of the

Act clearly contrary to Congressional intent." Brief forRespondents 26. But $ 501 merely prohibited application of
the gift tax statute to transfers antedating the enactment ofthe Act; it did not prohibit taxation when interests created
before the Act were transferred after enactment. Suchpostenactment transfers are all that happened on the occasion of Mrs. Irvine's disclaimer. The critical events, the
transfers of fractional portions of Mrs. Irvine's remainder toher children, occurred after enactment of the gift tax, though

the interests transferred were created before that date. To
argue otherwise, that the transfer to be taxed antedated the
Act, would be to cling to the legal fiction that the disclaimer
related back to the moment in 1917 when Lucius P. Ordway
established the trust. This fiction may be indulged under
state law as a device to regulate creditors' rights, but the
Jewett Court clearly held that Congress enacted no such fantasy.19 In sum, the retroactivity argument is sufficiently answered by our statement in United States v. Jacobs, 306 U. S.
363, 367 (1939), that a tax "does not operate retroactively
merely because some of the facts or conditions upon which
its application depends came into being prior to the enactment of the tax."

19 While respondents do not take the further step of arguing that $ 502
should be read to embody the fiction because due process would otherwise
be violated, they do argue that taxation here would violate due process
because Mrs. Irvine would not have been allowed to make a tax-free disclaimer within a reasonable time after adoption of the Act. But those
facts are not presented here, as Mrs. Irvine did not disclaim until 1979.

V
The Commissioner's assessment of federal gift tax on
Mrs. Irvine's 1979 disclaimer was authorized by the statute.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Blackmun took no part in the decision of this
case.

Justice Scalia, concurring in part and concurring in the
judgment.

I join the judgment of the Court, and its opinion except
for Part III-A. It seems to me that the basis for the "reasonable time" limitation in the Regulation cannot be, as the
Court says, ante, at 235, the need to deprive the beneficiary
of "a virtually unlimited opportunity to consider estate planning consequences." Considering estate planning consequences (not a malum in se) is nowhere condemned by the
tax laws, and I would see no basis for the Treasury Department's arbitrarily declaring a disclaimer to be a gift solely
in order to deter such consideration. The Secretary undoubtedly has broad discretion to determine the meaning of
the term "transfer" as it is used in the gift tax statute, and
undoubtedly may indulge an antagonism to estate planning
in choosing among permissible meanings. But "disclaimer
after opportunity for estate tax planning" is simply not a
permissible meaning.

The justification for the "reasonable time" limitation must,
as always, be a textual one. It consists, in my view, of the
fact that the failure to make a reasonably prompt disclaimer
of a known bequest is an implicit acceptance. Qui tacet,
consentire videtur. Thus, a later disclaimer, which causes
the property to go to someone else by operation of law, is
effectively a transfer to that someone else. (The implication
from nondisclaimer is much weaker when the interest is a

contingent one, but Jewett v. Commissioner, 455 U. S. 305(1982), resolved that issue--perhaps incorrectly.) While

Syllabus

LANDGRAF v. USI FILM PRODUCTS et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 92-757. Argued October 13, 1993--Decided April 26, 1994
After a bench trial in petitioner Landgraf's suit under Title VII of the

Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII), the District Court found that she
had been sexually harassed by a co-worker at respondent USI Film
Products, but that the harassment was not so severe as to justify her
decision to resign her position. Because the court found that her employment was not terminated in violation of Title VII, she was not entitled to equitable relief, and because Title VII did not then authorize any
other form of relief, the court dismissed her complaint. While her appeal was pending, the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (1991 Act or Act) became
law, $ 102 of which includes provisions that create a right to recover
compensatory and punitive damages for intentional discrimination violative of Title VII (hereinafter $ 102(a)), and authorize any party to demand a jury trial if such damages are claimed (hereinafter $ 102(c)). In
affirming, the Court of Appeals rejected Landgraf's argument that her
case should be remanded for a jury trial on damages pursuant to $ 102.

Held: Section 102 does not apply to a Title VII case that was pending on

appeal when the 1991 Act was enacted. Pp. 250-286.

(a) Since the President vetoed a 1990 version of the Act on the
ground, among others, of perceived unfairness in the bill's elaborate
retroactivity provision, it is likely that the omission of comparable language in the 1991 Act was not congressional oversight or unawareness,
but was a compromise that made the Act possible. That omission is
not dispositive here because it does not establish precisely where the
compromise was struck. For example, a decision to reach only cases
still pending, and not those already finally decided, might explain Congress' failure to provide in the 1991 Act, as it had in the 1990 bill, that
certain sections would apply to proceedings pending on specified preenactment dates. Pp. 250-257.

(b) The text of the 1991 Act does not evince any clear expression of
congressional intent as to whether $ 102 applies to cases arising before
the Act's passage. The provisions on which Landgraf relies for such an
expression--$ 402(a), which states that, "[e]xcept as otherwise specifically provided, this Act and the amendments made by this Act shall
take effect upon enactment," and $$ 402(b) and 109(c), which provide for
prospective application in limited contexts--cannot bear the heavy

weight she would place upon them by negative inference: Her statutory
argument would require the Court to assume that Congress chose a
surprisingly indirect route to convey an important and easily expressed
message. Moreover, the relevant legislative history reveals little to
suggest that Members of Congress believed that an agreement had
been tacitly reached on the controversial retroactivity issue or that
Congress understood or intended the interplay of the foregoing sections to have the decisive effect Landgraf assigns them. Instead, the
history conveys the impression that legislators agreed to disagree about
whether and to what extent the Act would apply to preenactment
conduct. Pp. 257-263.

(c) In order to resolve the question left open by the 1991 Act, this
Court must focus on the apparent tension between two seemingly
contradictory canons for interpreting statutes that do not specify
their temporal reach: the rule that a court must apply the law in effect
at the time it renders its decision, see Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U. S. 696, 711, and the axiom that statutory retroactivity is
not favored, see Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204,
208. Pp. 263-265.

(d) The presumption against statutory retroactivity is founded upon
elementary considerations of fairness dictating that individuals should
have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly. It is deeply rooted in this Court's jurisprudence and
finds expression in several constitutional provisions, including, in the
criminal context, the Ex Post Facto Clause. In the civil context, prospectivity remains the appropriate default rule unless Congress has
made clear its intent to disrupt settled expectations. Pp. 265-273.

(e) Thus, when a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the
events giving rise to the suit, a court's first task is to determine whether
Congress has expressly prescribed the statute's proper reach. If Congress has done so, there is no need to resort to judicial default rules.
Where the statute in question unambiguously applies to preenactment
conduct, there is no conflict between the antiretroactivity presumption
and the principle that a court should apply the law in effect at the time
of decision. Even absent specific legislative authorization, application
of a new statute to cases arising before its enactment is unquestionably
proper in many situations. However, where the new statute would
have a genuinely retroactive effect--i. e., where it would impair rights
a party possessed when he acted, increase his liability for past conduct,
or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed--
the traditional presumption teaches that the statute does not govern
absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result. Bradley did
not displace the traditional presumption. Pp. 273-280.

Syllabus
(f) Application of the foregoing principles demonstrates that, absent
guiding instructions from Congress, $ 102 is not the type of provision
that should govern cases arising before its enactment, but is instead
subject to the presumption against statutory retroactivity. Section
102(b)(1), which authorizes punitive damages in certain circumstances,
is clearly subject to the presumption, since the very labels given "punitive" or "exemplary" damages, as well as the rationales supporting
them, demonstrate that they share key characteristics of criminal sanctions, and therefore would raise a serious question under the Ex Post
Facto Clause if retroactively imposed. While the $ 102(a)(1) provision
authorizing compensatory damages is not so easily classified, it is also
subject to the presumption, since it confers a new right to monetary
relief on persons like Landgraf, who were victims of a hostile work environment but were not constructively discharged, and substantially increases the liability of their employers for the harms they caused, and
thus would operate "retrospectively" if applied to preenactment conduct. Although a jury trial right is ordinarily a procedural change of
the sort that would govern in trials conducted after its effective date
regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred, the jury trial option set out in $ 102(c)(1) must fall with the attached damages provisions
because $ 102(c) makes a jury trial available only "[i]f a complaining
party seeks compensatory or punitive damages." Pp. 280-286.

Opinion of the Court
Products (USI) plant in Tyler, Texas. She worked the 11p.m. to 7 a.m. shift operating a machine that produced plastic

bags. A fellow employee named John Williams repeatedlyharassed her with inappropriate remarks and physical contact. Petitioner's complaints to her immediate supervisor
brought her no relief, but when she reported the incidentsto the personnel manager, he conducted an investigation,

reprimanded Williams, and transferred him to another de-partment. Four days later petitioner quit her job.

Petitioner filed a timely charge with the Equal Employ-ment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commission).
The Commission determined that petitioner had likely beenthe victim of sexual harassment creating a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e et seq., but concluded that her em-ployer had adequately remedied the violation. Accordingly,

the Commission dismissed the charge and issued a notice ofright to sue.

On July 21, 1989, petitioner commenced this action againstUSI, its corporate owner, and that company's successor in
interest.2 After a bench trial, the District Court found thatWilliams had sexually harassed petitioner causing her to suffer mental anguish. However, the court concluded that shehad not been constructively discharged. The court said:

"Although the harassment was serious enough toestablish that a hostile work environment existed for
Landgraf, it was not so severe that a reasonable per-son would have felt compelled to resign. This is particularly true in light of the fact that at the time Land-graf resigned from her job, USI had taken steps . . . to
eliminate the hostile working environment arising fromthe sexual harassment. Landgraf voluntarily resigned

2 Respondent Quantum Chemical Corporation owned the USI plant
when petitioner worked there. Respondent Bonar Packaging, Inc., subsequently purchased the operation.

from her employment with USI for reasons unrelated tothe sexual harassment in question." App. to Pet. for

Cert. B-3-4.
Because the court found that petitioner's employment wasnot terminated in violation of Title VII, she was not entitled to equitable relief, and because Title VII did not thenauthorize any other form of relief, the court dismissed her
complaint.On November 21, 1991, while petitioner's appeal was pending, the President signed into law the Civil Rights Act of1991. The Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's argument
that her case should be remanded for a jury trial on damagespursuant to the 1991 Act. Its decision not to remand rested
on the premise that "a court must `apply the law in effect atthe time it renders its decision, unless doing so would result
in manifest injustice or there is statutory direction or legisla-tive history to the contrary.'

Bradley [v. School Bd. ofRichmond, 416 U. S. 696, 711 (1974)]." 968 F. 2d 427, 432

(CA5 1992). Commenting first on the provision for a jurytrial in $ 102(c), the court stated that requiring the defendant
"to retry this case because of a statutory change enactedafter the trial was completed would be an injustice and a
waste of judicial resources. We apply procedural rules topending cases, but we do not invalidate procedures followed
before the new rule was adopted." Id., at 432-433. Thecourt then characterized the provision for compensatory and
punitive damages in $ 102 as "a seachange in employer liabil-ity for Title VII violations" and concluded that it would be
unjust to apply this kind of additional and unforeseeable obli-gation to conduct occurring before the effective date of the
Act. Id., at 433. Finding no clear error in the DistrictCourt's factual findings, the Court of Appeals affirmed the
judgment for respondents.We granted certiorari and set the case for argument with
Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., post, p. 298. Our orderlimited argument to the question whether $ 102 of the 1991

Opinion of the Court
Act applies to cases pending when it became law. 507 U. S.908 (1993). Accordingly, for purposes of our decision, we

assume that the District Court and the Court of Appealsproperly applied the law in effect at the time of the discriminatory conduct and that the relevant findings of factwere correct. We therefore assume that petitioner was the
victim of sexual harassment violative of Title VII, but thatthe law did not then authorize any recovery of damages even
though she was injured. We also assume, arguendo, that ifthe same conduct were to occur today, petitioner would be
entitled to a jury trial and that the jury might find that shewas constructively discharged, or that her mental anguish or
other injuries would support an award of damages againsther former employer. Thus, the controlling question is
whether the Court of Appeals should have applied the lawin effect at the time the discriminatory conduct occurred, or
at the time of its decision in July 1992.

II
Petitioner's primary submission is that the text of the 1991Act requires that it be applied to cases pending on its enactment. Her argument, if accepted, would make the entireAct (with two narrow exceptions) applicable to conduct that
occurred, and to cases that were filed, before the Act's effec-tive date. Although only $ 102 is at issue in this case, we
preface our analysis with a brief description of the scope ofthe 1991 Act.

The 1991 Act is in large part a response to a series ofdecisions of this Court interpreting the Civil Rights Acts of
1866 and 1964. Section 3(4), 105 Stat. 1071, note following42 U. S. C. $ 1981, expressly identifies as one of the Act's purposes "to respond to recent decisions of the Supreme Courtby expanding the scope of relevant civil rights statutes in
order to provide adequate protection to victims of discrimi-nation." That section, as well as a specific finding in $ 2(2),
identifies Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U. S. 642

(1989), as a decision that gave rise to special concerns.3 Sec-tion 105 of the Act, entitled "Burden of Proof in Disparate

Impact Cases," is a direct response to Wards Cove.Other sections of the Act were obviously drafted with "recent decisions of the Supreme Court" in mind. Thus, $ 101
(which is at issue in Rivers, post, p. 298) amended the 1866Civil Rights Act's prohibition of racial discrimination in the

"mak[ing] and enforce[ment] [of] contracts," 42 U. S. C. $ 1981(1988 ed., Supp. IV), in response to

Patterson v. McLean
Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164 (1989); $ 107 responds to Price
Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228 (1989), by setting forth
standards applicable in "mixed motive" cases; $ 108 respondsto

Martin v. Wilks, 490 U. S. 755 (1989), by prohibiting certain challenges to employment practices implementing consent decrees; $ 109 responds to EEOC v. Arabian American
Oil Co., 499 U. S. 244 (1991), by redefining the term "employee" as used in Title VII to include certain United States
citizens working in foreign countries for United States employers; $ 112 responds to Lorance v. AT&T Technologies,
Inc., 490 U. S. 900 (1989), by expanding employees' rights to
challenge discriminatory seniority systems; $ 113 responds to
West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S. 83
(1991), by providing that an award of attorney's fees may
include expert fees; and $ 114 responds to Library of Congress v. Shaw, 478 U. S. 310 (1986), by allowing interest on
judgments against the United States.

A number of important provisions in the Act, however,
were not responses to Supreme Court decisions. For example, $ 106 enacts a new prohibition against adjusting test

scope and effectiveness of Federal civil rights protections," and $ 3(2)

U. S. 642 (1989)." We take note of the express references to that case
because it is the focus of $ 402(b), on which petitioner places particular
reliance. See infra, at 258-263.

the House of Representatives and certain employees of theLegislative Branch; and $$ 301-325 establish special procedures to protect Senate employees from discrimination.Among the provisions that did not directly respond to
any Supreme Court decision is the one at issue in this case,$ 102.

Entitled "Damages in Cases of Intentional Discrimina-tion," $ 102 provides in relevant part:

"(a) Right of Recovery.--"(1) Civil Rights.--In an action brought by a complaining party under section 706 or 717 of the CivilRights Act of 1964 (42 U. S. C. 2000e-5) against a respondent who engaged in unlawful intentional discrimi-nation (not an employment practice that is unlawful because of its disparate impact) prohibited under section703, 704, or 717 of the Act (42 U. S. C. 2000e-2 or 2000e-
3), and provided that the complaining party cannot re-cover under section 1977 of the Revised Statutes (42
U. S. C. 1981), the complaining party may recover com-pensatory and punitive damages . . . in addition to any
relief authorized by section 706(g) of the Civil RightsAct of 1964, from the respondent.

. . . . .
"(c) Jury Trial.--If a complaining party seeks compensa-tory or punitive damages under this section--

"(1) any party may demand a trial by jury."
Before the enactment of the 1991 Act, Title VII affordedonly "equitable" remedies. The primary form of monetary relief available was backpay.4 Title VII's backpay rem4 We have not decided whether a plaintiff seeking backpay under Title
VII is entitled to a jury trial. See, e. g., Lytle v. Household Mfg., Inc.,
494 U. S. 545, 549, n. 1 (1990) (assuming without deciding no right to jury
trial); Teamsters v. Terry, 494 U. S. 558, 572 (1990) (same). Because peti511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT

edy,5 modeled on that of the National Labor Relations Act,29 U. S. C. $ 160(c), is a "make-whole" remedy that resembles

compensatory damages in some respects. See Albemarle
Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 418-422 (1975). However,
the new compensatory damages provision of the 1991 Act is
"in addition to," and does not replace or duplicate, the back-pay remedy allowed under prior law. Indeed, to prevent

double recovery, the 1991 Act provides that compensatorydamages "shall not include backpay, interest on backpay, or
any other type of relief authorized under section 706(g) ofthe Civil Rights Act of 1964." $ 102(b)(2).

Section 102 significantly expands the monetary relief po-tentially available to plaintiffs who would have been entitled
to backpay under prior law. Before 1991, for example, monetary relief for a discriminatorily discharged employee gen-erally included "only an amount equal to the wages the employee would have earned from the date of discharge to the
date of reinstatement, along with lost fringe benefits such as
vacation pay and pension benefits." United States v. Burke,
504 U. S. 229, 239 (1992). Under $ 102, however, a Title VII
plaintiff who wins a backpay award may also seek compensatory damages for "future pecuniary losses, emotional pain,
suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment
of life, and other nonpecuniary losses." $ 102(b)(3). In adtioner does not argue that she had a right to jury trial even under pre-1991
law, again we need not address this question.

5 "If the court finds that the respondent has intentionally engaged in . . .

an unlawful employment practice charged in the complaint, the court may
. . . order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, which may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or
without back pay . . . or any other equitable relief as the court deems
appropriate. Back pay liability shall not accrue from a date more than
two years prior to the filing of a charge with the Commission. Interim
earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or
persons discriminated against shall operate to reduce the back pay otherwise allowable." Civil Rights Act of 1964, $ 706(g), as amended, 42
U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(g) (1988 ed., Supp. IV).

Opinion of the Court
dition, when it is shown that the employer acted "with malice
or with reckless indifference to the [plaintiff 's] federally protected rights," $ 102(b)(1), a plaintiff may recover punitive
damages.6

Section 102 also allows monetary relief for some forms of
workplace discrimination that would not previously have justified any relief under Title VII. As this case illustrates,
even if unlawful discrimination was proved, under prior law
a Title VII plaintiff could not recover monetary relief unless
the discrimination was also found to have some concrete effect on the plaintiff 's employment status, such as a denied
promotion, a differential in compensation, or termination.
See Burke, 504 U. S., at 240. ("[T]he circumscribed remedies available under Title VII [before the 1991 Act] stand in
marked contrast not only to those available under traditional
tort law, but under other federal anti-discrimination statutes,
as well"). Section 102, however, allows a plaintiff to recover
in circumstances in which there has been unlawful discrimination in the "terms, conditions, or privileges of employment," 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1),7 even though the discrimination did not involve a discharge or a loss of pay. In short,
to further Title VII's "central statutory purposes of eradicating discrimination throughout the economy and making persons whole for injuries suffered through past discrimination," Albemarle Paper Co., 422 U. S., at 421, $ 102 of the

6 Section 102(b)(3) imposes limits, varying with the size of the employer,
on the amount of compensatory and punitive damages that may be
awarded to an individual plaintiff. Thus, the sum of such damages
awarded a plaintiff may not exceed $50,000 for employers with between
14 and 100 employees; $100,000 for employers with between 101 and 200
employees; $200,000 for employers with between 200 and 500 employees;
and $300,000 for employers with more than 500 employees.

7 See Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U. S. 17, 21 (1993) (discrimination in "terms, conditions, or privileges of employment" actionable under
Title VII "is not limited to `economic' or `tangible' discrimination") (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).

1991 Act effects a major expansion in the relief available tovictims of employment discrimination.

In 1990, a comprehensive civil rights bill passed bothHouses of Congress. Although similar to the 1991 Act in
many other respects, the 1990 bill differed in that it con-tained language expressly calling for application of many of
its provisions, including the section providing for damagesin cases of intentional employment discrimination, to cases
arising before its (expected) enactment.8 The President ve8 The relevant section of the Civil Rights Act of 1990, S. 2104, 101st
Cong., 1st Sess. (1990), provided:

toed the 1990 legislation, however, citing the bill's "unfairretroactivity rules" as one reason for his disapproval.

9 Congress narrowly failed to override the veto. See 136 Cong.Rec. S16589 (Oct. 24, 1990) (66 to 34 Senate vote in favor

of override).The absence of comparable language in the 1991 Act cannot realistically be attributed to oversight or to unawarenessof the retroactivity issue. Rather, it seems likely that one
of the compromises that made it possible to enact the 1991version was an agreement

not to include the kind of explicitretroactivity command found in the 1990 bill.

The omission of the elaborate retroactivity provision of the1990 bill--which was by no means the only source of political
controversy over that legislation--is not dispositive becauseit does not tell us precisely where the compromise was struck
in the 1991 Act. The Legislature might, for example, havesettled in 1991 on a less expansive form of retroactivity that,
unlike the 1990 bill, did not reach cases already finally de-cided. See n. 8,

supra. A decision to reach only cases stillpending might explain Congress' failure to provide in the

vested, where the time for seeking further judicial review of such judgment has otherwise expired pursuant to title 28 of the United States Code,
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the Federal Rules of Appellate
Procedure, shall be vacated in whole or in part if justice requires pursuant
to rule 60(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or other appropriate authority, and consistent with the constitutional requirements of
due process of law."

22, 1990), reprinted in 136 Cong. Rec. S16418, S16419 (Oct. 22, 1990). The
President's veto message referred to the bill's "retroactivity" only briefly;
the Attorney General's Memorandum to which the President referred was
no more expansive, and may be read to refer only to the bill's special
provision for reopening final judgments, see n. 8, supra, rather than its
provisions covering pending cases. See Memorandum of the Attorney

Opinion of the Court
1991 Act, as it had in 1990, that certain sections would applyto proceedings pending on specific preenactment dates. Our

first question, then, is whether the statutory text on whichpetitioner relies manifests an intent that the 1991 Act should
be applied to cases that arose and went to trial before itsenactment.

III
Petitioner's textual argument relies on three provisions ofthe 1991 Act: $$ 402(a), 402(b), and 109(c). Section 402(a),

the only provision of the Act that speaks directly to the ques-tion before us, states:

"Except as otherwise specifically provided, this Actand the amendments made by this Act shall take effect
upon enactment."
That language does not, by itself, resolve the question beforeus. A statement that a statute will become effective on a

certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has anyapplication to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.

10

10 The history of prior amendments to Title VII suggests that the
"effective-upon-enactment" formula would have been an especially inapt
way to reach pending cases. When it amended Title VII in the Equal
Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, Congress explicitly provided:

"The amendments made by this Act to section 706 of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 shall be applicable with respect to charges pending with the
Commission on the date of enactment of this Act and all charges filed
thereafter." Pub. L. 92-261, $ 14, 86 Stat. 113. In contrast, in amending
Title VII to bar discrimination on the basis of pregnancy in 1978, Congress provided:

"Except as provided in subsection (b), the amendment made by this Act
shall be effective on the date of enactment." $ 2(a), 92 Stat. 2076.

The only Courts of Appeals to consider whether the 1978 amendments
applied to pending cases concluded that they did not. See Schwabenbauer
v. Board of Ed. of School Dist. of Olean, 667 F. 2d 305, 310, n. 7 (CA2
1981); Condit v. United Air Lines, Inc., 631 F. 2d 1136, 1139-1140 (CA4

Opinion of the Court
Petitioner does not argue otherwise. Rather, she contendsthat the introductory clause of $ 402(a) would be superfluous

unless it refers to $$ 402(b) and 109(c), which provide for pro-spective application in limited contexts.

The parties agree that $ 402(b) was intended to exempta single disparate impact lawsuit against the Wards Cove
Packing Company. Section 402(b) provides:

"(b) Certain Disparate Impact Cases.--Notwith-standing any other provision of this Act, nothing in this

Act shall apply to any disparate impact case for which acomplaint was filed before March 1, 1975, and for which
an initial decision was rendered after October 30, 1983."
Section 109(c), part of the section extending Title VII tooverseas employers, states:

"(c) Application of Amendments.--The amend-ments made by this section shall not apply with respect
to conduct occurring before the date of the enactment ofthis Act."

According to petitioner, these two subsections are the "otherprovisions" contemplated in the first clause of $ 402(a), and
together create a strong negative inference that all sectionsof the Act not specifically declared prospective apply to
pending cases that arose before November 21, 1991.Before addressing the particulars of petitioner's argument,
we observe that she places extraordinary weight on two com-paratively minor and narrow provisions in a long and complex statute. Applying the entire Act to cases arising frompreenactment conduct would have important consequences,
including the possibility that trials completed before its enble to case arising before enactment); Sikora v. American Can Co., 622
F. 2d 1116, 1119-1124 (CA3 1980) (same). If we assume that Congress
was familiar with those decisions, cf. Cannon v. University of Chicago,
441 U. S. 677, 698-699 (1979), its choice of language in $ 402(a) would
imply nonretroactivity.

Opinion of the Court
actment would need to be retried and the possibility thatemployers would be liable for punitive damages for conduct

antedating the Act's enactment. Purely prospective appli-cation, on the other hand, would prolong the life of a remedial
scheme, and of judicial constructions of civil rights statutes,
that Congress obviously found wanting. Given the highstakes of the retroactivity question, the broad coverage of

the statute, and the prominent and specific retroactivity pro-visions in the 1990 bill, it would be surprising for Congress
to have chosen to resolve that question through negative in-ferences drawn from two provisions of quite limited effect.

Petitioner, however, invokes the canon that a court should
give effect to every provision of a statute and thus avoid
redundancy among different provisions. See, e. g., Mackey
v. Lanier Collection Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U. S. 825,
837, and n. 11 (1988). Unless the word "otherwise" in

$ 402(a) refers to either $ 402(b) or $ 109(c), she contends, the
first five words in $ 402(a) are entirely superfluous. Moreover, relying on the canon "[e]xpressio unius est exclusio
alterius," see Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U. S. 163, 168 (1993),
petitioner argues that because Congress provided specifically for prospectivity in two places ($$ 109(c) and 402(b)), we
should infer that it intended the opposite for the remainder
of the statute.

Petitioner emphasizes that $ 402(a) begins: "Except as
otherwise specifically provided." A scan of the statute for
other "specific provisions" concerning effective dates reveals
that $$ 402(b) and 109(c) are the most likely candidates.
Since those provisions decree prospectivity, and since

$ 402(a) tells us that the specific provisions are exceptions,

$ 402(b) should be considered as prescribing a general rule of
retroactivity. Petitioner's argument has some force, but we
find it most unlikely that Congress intended the introductory
clause to carry the critically important meaning petitioner
assigns it. Had Congress wished $ 402(a) to have such a de511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
terminate meaning, it surely would have used language com-parable to its reference to the predecessor Title VII damages

provisions in the 1990 legislation: that the new provisions"shall apply to all proceedings pending on or commenced
after the date of enactment of this Act." S. 2104, 101st
Cong., 1st Sess. $ 15(a)(4) (1990).It is entirely possible that Congress inserted the "otherwise specifically provided" language not because it under-stood the "takes effect" clause to establish a rule of retroactivity to which only two "other specific provisions" wouldbe exceptions, but instead to assure that any specific timing
provisions in the Act would prevail over the general "takeeffect on enactment" command. The drafters of a complicated piece of legislation containing more than 50 separate
sections may well have inserted the "except as otherwiseprovided" language merely to avoid the risk of an inadvertent conflict in the statute.11 If the introductory clause of

$ 402(a) was intended to refer specifically to $$ 402(b), 109(c),
or both, it is difficult to understand why the drafters chose
the word "otherwise" rather than either or both of the appropriate section numbers.

We are also unpersuaded by petitioner's argument that
both $$ 402(b) and 109(c) merely duplicate the "take effect
upon enactment" command of $ 402(a) unless all other provisions, including the damages provisions of $ 102, apply to
pending cases. That argument depends on the assumption
that all those other provisions must be treated uniformly
for purposes of their application to pending cases based
on preenactment conduct. That thesis, however, is by no

11 There is some evidence that the drafters of the 1991 Act did not devote
particular attention to the interplay of the Act's "effective date" provisions. Section 110, which directs the EEOC to establish a "Technical Assistance Training Institute" to assist employers in complying with antidiscrimination laws and regulations, contains a subsection providing that it
"shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act." $ 110(b).
That provision and $ 402(a) are unavoidably redundant.

Opinion of the Court
means an inevitable one. It is entirely possible--indeed,
highly probable--that, because it was unable to resolve the
retroactivity issue with the clarity of the 1990 legislation,
Congress viewed the matter as an open issue to be resolved
by the courts. Our precedents on retroactivity left doubts
about what default rule would apply in the absence of congressional guidance, and suggested that some provisions
might apply to cases arising before enactment while others
might not.12 Compare Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204 (1988), with Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U. S. 696 (1974). See also Bennett v. New Jersey,
470 U. S. 632 (1985). The only matters Congress did not
leave to the courts were set out with specificity in $$ 109(c)
and 402(b). Congressional doubt concerning judicial retroactivity doctrine, coupled with the likelihood that the routine
"take effect upon enactment" language would require courts
to fall back upon that doctrine, provide a plausible explanation for both $$ 402(b) and 109(c) that makes neither provision redundant.

Turning to the text of $ 402(b), it seems unlikely that the
introductory phrase ("Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Act") was meant to refer to the immediately preceding subsection. Since petitioner does not contend that any
other provision speaks to the general effective date issue, the
logic of her argument requires us to interpret that phrase to
mean nothing more than "Notwithstanding $ 402(a)." Petitioner's textual argument assumes that the drafters selected
the indefinite word "otherwise" in $ 402(a) to identify two

12 This point also diminishes the force of petitioner's "expressio unius"
argument. Once one abandons the unsupported assumption that Congress expected that all of the Act's provisions would be treated alike, and
takes account of uncertainty about the applicable default rule, $$ 109(c)
and 402(b) do not carry the negative implication petitioner draws from
them. We do not read either provision as doing anything more than definitively rejecting retroactivity with respect to the specific matters covered by its plain language.

specific subsections and the even more indefinite term "anyother provision" in $ 402(b) to refer to nothing more than

$ 402(b)'s next-door neighbor--$ 402(a). Here again, peti-tioner's statutory argument would require us to assume that
Congress chose a surprisingly indirect route to convey animportant and easily expressed message concerning the Act's
effect on pending cases.The relevant legislative history of the 1991 Act reinforces
our conclusion that $$ 402(a), 109(c), and 402(b) cannot bearthe weight petitioner places upon them. The 1991 bill as
originally introduced in the House contained explicit retroac-tivity provisions similar to those found in the 1990 bill.

13

However, the Senate substitute that was agreed upon omit-ted those explicit retroactivity provisions.

14 The legislative

history discloses some frankly partisan statements about themeaning of the final effective date language, but those statements cannot plausibly be read as reflecting any generalagreement.

15 The history reveals no evidence that Mem13 See, e. g., H. R. 1, 102d Cong., 1st Sess. $ 113 (1991), reprinted in 137
Cong. Rec. H3924-H3925 (Jan. 3, 1991). The prospectivity proviso to the
section extending Title VII to overseas employers was first added to legislation that generally was to apply to pending cases. See H. R. 1, 102d
Cong., 1st Sess. $ 119(c) (1991), reprinted in 137 Cong. Rec. H3925-H3926
(June 5, 1991). Thus, at the time its language was introduced, the provision that became $ 109(c) was surely not redundant.

14 On the other hand, two proposals that would have provided explicitly

for prospectivity also foundered. See 137 Cong. Rec. S3021, S3023 (Mar.
12, 1991); id., at 13255, 13265-13266.

15 For example, in an "interpretive memorandum" introduced on behalf

of seven Republican sponsors of S. 1745, the bill that became the 1991 Act,
Senator Danforth stated that "[t]he bill provides that, unless otherwise
specified, the provisions of this legislation shall take effect upon enactment
and shall not apply retroactively." Id., at 29047 (emphasis added). Senator Kennedy responded that it "will be up to the courts to determine the
extent to which the bill will apply to cases and claims that were pending
on the date of enactment." Ibid. (citing Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U. S. 696 (1974)). The legislative history reveals other partisan
statements on the proper meaning of the Act's "effective date" provisions.
Senator Danforth observed that such statements carry little weight as
legislative history. As he put it:

Opinion of the Court
bers believed that an agreement had been tacitly struck onthe controversial retroactivity issue, and little to suggest

that Congress understood or intended the interplay of$$ 402(a), 402(b), and 109(c) to have the decisive effect petitioner assigns them. Instead, the history of the 1991 Actconveys the impression that legislators agreed to disagree
about whether and to what extent the Act would apply topreenactment conduct.

Although the passage of the 1990 bill may indicate that amajority of the 1991 Congress also favored retroactive application, even the will of the majority does not become lawunless it follows the path charted in Article I, $ 7, cl. 2, of
the Constitution. See INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 946-951(1983). In the absence of the kind of unambiguous directive
found in $ 15 of the 1990 bill, we must look elsewhere forguidance on whether $ 102 applies to this case.

IV
It is not uncommon to find "apparent tension" betweendifferent canons of statutory construction. As Professor

Llewellyn famously illustrated, many of the traditional can-ons have equal opposites.

16 In order to resolve the question

left open by the 1991 Act, federal courts have labored to

"[A] court would be well advised to take with a large grain of salt floor
debate and statements placed in the Congressional Record which
purport to create an interpretation for the legislation that is before us."
137 Cong. Rec. S15325 (Oct. 29, 1991).

16 See Llewellyn, Remarks on the Theory of Appellate Decision and the

Rules or Canons about How Statutes are to be Construed, 3 Vand. L. Rev.
395 (1950). Llewellyn's article identified the apparent conflict between
the canon that

"[a] statute imposing a new penalty or forfeiture, or a new liability or
disability, or creating a new right of action will not be construed as having
a retroactive effect"

and the countervailing rule that

"[r]emedial statutes are to be liberally construed and if a retroactive
interpretation will promote the ends of justice, they should receive such
construction." Id., at 402 (citations omitted).

Opinion of the Court
reconcile two seemingly contradictory statements found inour decisions concerning the effect of intervening changes in

the law. Each statement is framed as a generally applicablerule for interpreting statutes that do not specify their temporal reach. The first is the rule that "a court is to apply
the law in effect at the time it renders its decision," Bradley,416 U. S., at 711. The second is the axiom that "[r]etroactivity is not favored in the law," and its interpretive corollarythat "congressional enactments and administrative rules will
not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their lan-guage requires this result."

Bowen, 488 U. S., at 208.
We have previously noted the "apparent tension" between
those expressions. See Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical
Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U. S. 827, 837 (1990); see also Bennett,
470 U. S., at 639-640. We found it unnecessary in Kaiser to
resolve that seeming conflict "because under either view,
where the congressional intent is clear, it governs," and the
prejudgment interest statute at issue in that case evinced
"clear congressional intent" that it was "not applicable to
judgments entered before its effective date." 499 U. S., at
837-838. In the case before us today, however, we have concluded that the 1991 Act does not evince any clear expression
of intent on $ 102's application to cases arising before the
Act's enactment. We must, therefore, focus on the apparent
tension between the rules we have espoused for handling
similar problems in the absence of an instruction from
Congress.

We begin by noting that there is no tension between the
holdings in Bradley and Bowen, both of which were unanimous decisions. Relying on another unanimous decision--
Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham, 393 U. S. 268
(1969)--we held in Bradley that a statute authorizing the
award of attorney's fees to successful civil rights plaintiffs
applied in a case that was pending on appeal at the time the
statute was enacted. Bowen held that the Department of
Health and Human Services lacked statutory authority to

promulgate a rule requiring private hospitals to refundMedicare payments for services rendered before promulgation of the rule. Our opinion in Bowen did not purport tooverrule Bradley or to limit its reach. In this light, we turn
to the "apparent tension" between the two canons mindful ofanother canon of unquestionable vitality, the "maxim not to
be disregarded that general expressions, in every opinion,are to be taken in connection with the case in which those
expressions are used." Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264,399 (1821).

As Justice Scalia has demonstrated, the presumptionagainst retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence, and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older thanour Republic.

17 Elementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an opportunity to knowwhat the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly;

settled expectations should not be lightly disrupted.18 Forthat reason, the "principle that the legal effect of conduct
should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existedwhen the conduct took place has timeless and universal appeal." Kaiser, 494 U. S., at 855 (Scalia, J., concurring). In

17 See Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U. S. 827,

Van Kleeck, 7 Johns. *477, *503 (N. Y. 1811) ("It is a principle of the English common law, as ancient as the law itself, that a statute, even of its
omnipotent parliament, is not to have a retrospective effect") (Kent, C. J.);

Jurisprudence, 20 Minn. L. Rev. 775 (1936).

18 See General Motors Corp. v. Romein, 503 U. S. 181, 191 (1992) ("Retroactive legislation presents problems of unfairness that are more serious
than those posed by prospective legislation, because it can deprive citizens
of legitimate expectations and upset settled transactions"); Munzer, A

rule of law . . . is a defeasible entitlement of persons to have their behavior

Opinion of the Court
a free, dynamic society, creativity in both commercial andartistic endeavors is fostered by a rule of law that gives people confidence about the legal consequences of their actions.It is therefore not surprising that the antiretroactivity
principle finds expression in several provisions of our Consti-tution. The

Ex Post Facto Clause flatly prohibits retroac-tive application of penal legislation.

19 Article I, $ 10, cl. 1,

prohibits States from passing another type of retroactivelegislation, laws "impairing the Obligation of Contracts."

The Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause prevents the Legis-lature (and other government actors) from depriving private
persons of vested property rights except for a "public use"and upon payment of "just compensation." The prohibitions
on "Bills of Attainder" in Art. I, $$ 9-10, prohibit legislaturesfrom singling out disfavored persons and meting out summary punishment for past conduct. See, e. g., United Statesv.

Brown, 381 U. S. 437, 456-462 (1965). The Due ProcessClause also protects the interests in fair notice and repose

that may be compromised by retroactive legislation; a justi-fication sufficient to validate a statute's prospective application under the Clause "may not suffice" to warrant its retro-active application.

Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co.,428 U. S. 1, 17 (1976).

These provisions demonstrate that retroactive statutesraise particular concerns. The Legislature's unmatched
powers allow it to sweep away settled expectations suddenlyand without individualized consideration. Its responsivity
to political pressures poses a risk that it may be tempted touse retroactive legislation as a means of retribution against
unpopular groups or individuals. As Justice Marshall ob-served in his opinion for the Court in

Weaver v. Graham,450 U. S. 24 (1981), the Ex Post Facto Clause not only en19 Article I contains two Ex Post Facto Clauses, one directed to Congress ($ 9, cl. 3), the other to the States ($ 10, cl. 1). We have construed
the Clauses as applicable only to penal legislation. See Calder v. Bull, 3

The Constitution's restrictions, of course, are of limitedscope. Absent a violation of one of those specific provisions,

the potential unfairness of retroactive civil legislation is nota sufficient reason for a court to fail to give a statute its
intended scope.21 Retroactivity provisions often serve en20 See Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 513-514 (1989) ("Legislatures are primarily policymaking bodies that promulgate rules to govern future conduct. The constitutional prohibitions against the enactment of ex post facto laws and bills of attainder reflect a valid concern
about the use of the political process to punish or characterize past conduct
of private citizens. It is the judicial system, rather than the legislative
process, that is best equipped to identify past wrongdoers and to fashion
remedies that will create the conditions that presumably would have existed had no wrong been committed") (Stevens, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment); James v. United States, 366 U. S. 213, 247, n. 3
(1961) (retroactive punitive measures may reflect "a purpose not to prevent dangerous conduct generally but to impose by legislation a penalty
against specific persons or classes of persons").

James Madison argued that retroactive legislation also offered special
opportunities for the powerful to obtain special and improper legislative
benefits. According to Madison, "[b]ills of attainder, ex post facto laws,
and laws impairing the obligation of contracts" were "contrary to the first
principles of the social compact, and to every principle of sound legislation," in part because such measures invited the "influential" to "speculat[e] on public measures," to the detriment of the "more industrious and
less informed part of the community." The Federalist No. 44, p. 301 (J.
Cooke ed. 1961). See Hochman, The Supreme Court and the Constitutionality of Retroactive Legislation, 73 Harv. L. Rev. 692, 693 (1960) (a retroactive statute "may be passed with an exact knowledge of who will benefit
from it").

21 In some cases, however, the interest in avoiding the adjudication of

constitutional questions will counsel against a retroactive application.
For if a challenged statute is to be given retroactive effect, the regulatory
interest that supports prospective application will not necessarily also sustain its application to past events. See Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. R. A. Gray & Co., 467 U. S. 717, 730 (1984); Usery v. Turner

tirely benign and legitimate purposes, whether to respond to
emergencies, to correct mistakes, to prevent circumvention
of a new statute in the interval immediately preceding its
passage, or simply to give comprehensive effect to a new law
Congress considers salutary. However, a requirement that
Congress first make its intention clear helps ensure that
Congress itself has determined that the benefits of retroactivity outweigh the potential for disruption or unfairness.

While statutory retroactivity has long been disfavored, deciding when a statute operates "retroactively" is not always
a simple or mechanical task. Sitting on Circuit, Justice
Story offered an influential definition in Society for Propagation of the Gospel v. Wheeler, 22 F. Cas. 756 (No. 13,156) (CC
NH 1814), a case construing a provision of the New Hampshire Constitution that broadly prohibits "retrospective"
laws both criminal and civil.22 Justice Story first rejected
the notion that the provision bars only explicitly retroactive
legislation, i. e., "statutes . . . enacted to take effect from a
time anterior to their passage." Id., at 767. Such a construction, he concluded, would be "utterly subversive of all
the objects" of the prohibition. Ibid. Instead, the ban on
retrospective legislation embraced "all statutes, which,
though operating only from their passage, affect vested

that Congress has ample power to provide for retroactive application of

$ 102.

22 Article 23 of the New Hampshire Bill of Rights provides: "Retrospective laws are highly injurious, oppressive and unjust. No such laws,
therefore, should be made, either for the decision of civil causes or the
punishment of offenses." At issue in the Society case was a new statute
that reversed a common-law rule by allowing certain wrongful possessors
of land, upon being ejected by the rightful owner, to obtain compensation
for improvements made on the land. Justice Story held that the new statute impaired the owner's rights and thus could not, consistently with Article 23, be applied to require compensation for improvements made before
the statute's enactment. See 22 F. Cas., at 766-769.

rights and past transactions." Ibid. "Upon principle," Jus-tice Story elaborated,

"every statute, which takes away or impairs vestedrights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new
obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new dis-ability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past, must be deemed retrospective . . . ." Ibid.(citing

Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386 (1798), and Dash v. VanKleeck, 7 Johns. *477 (N. Y. 1811)).

Though the formulas have varied, similar functional concep-tions of legislative "retroactivity" have found voice in this
Court's decisions and elsewhere.23A statute does not operate "retrospectively" merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedatingthe statute's enactment, see

`retrospective' are synonymous in judicial usage . . . . They describe acts
which operate on transactions which have occurred or rights and obligations which existed before passage of the act").

regulation may upset the reasonable expectations that prompted those
affected to acquire property; a new law banning gambling harms the person who had begun to construct a casino before the law's enactment or

Opinion of the Court
whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences
to events completed before its enactment. The conclusion
that a particular rule operates "retroactively" comes at the
end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection
between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past
event. Any test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases, and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity. However, retroactivity is a matter on which judges tend
to have "sound . . . instinct[s]," see Danforth v. Groton Water
Co., 178 Mass. 472, 476, 59 N. E. 1033, 1034 (1901) (Holmes,
J.), and familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations offer sound guidance.

Since the early days of this Court, we have declined to
give retroactive effect to statutes burdening private rights
unless Congress had made clear its intent. Thus, in United
States v. Heth, 3 Cranch 399 (1806), we refused to apply a
federal statute reducing the commissions of customs collectors to collections commenced before the statute's enactment
because the statute lacked "clear, strong, and imperative"
language requiring retroactive application, id., at 413 (opinion of Paterson, J.). The presumption against statutory retroactivity has consistently been explained by reference to
the unfairness of imposing new burdens on persons after the
fact. Indeed, at common law a contrary rule applied to statutes that merely removed a burden on private rights by repealing a penal provision (whether criminal or civil); such

spent his life learning to count cards. See Fuller 60 ("If every time a
man relied on existing law in arranging his affairs, he were made secure
against any change in legal rules, the whole body of our law would be
ossified forever"). Moreover, a statute "is not made retroactive merely
because it draws upon antecedent facts for its operation." Cox v. Hart,
260 U. S. 427, 435 (1922). See Reynolds v. United States, 292 U. S. 443,
444-449 (1934); Chicago & Alton R. Co. v. Tranbarger, 238 U. S. 67, 73
(1915).

repeals were understood to preclude punishment for acts an-tedating the repeal. See, e. g., United States v. Chambers,

291 U. S. 217, 223-224 (1934); Gulf, C. & S. F. R. Co. v. Den-nis, 224 U. S. 503, 506 (1912); United States v. Tynen, 11 Wall.

5 Cranch 281, 284 (1809). But see 1 U. S. C. $ 109 (repealingcommon-law rule).

The largest category of cases in which we have appliedthe presumption against statutory retroactivity has involved
new provisions affecting contractual or property rights, mat-ters in which predictability and stability are of prime importance.25 The presumption has not, however, been limited tosuch cases. At issue in Chew Heong v. United States, 112
U. S. 536 (1884), for example, was a provision of the "Chinese
Restriction Act" of 1882 barring Chinese laborers from reen-tering the United States without a certificate prepared when

they exited this country. We held that the statute did notbar the reentry of a laborer who had left the United States
before the certification requirement was promulgated. Jus-tice Harlan's opinion for the Court observed that the law in
effect before the 1882 enactment had accorded laborers aright to reenter without a certificate, and invoked the "uniformly" accepted rule against "giv[ing] to statutes a retro25 See, e. g., United States v. Security Industrial Bank, 459 U. S. 70,

v. Lessee of Carroll, 16 How. 275 (1854). While the great majority of our
decisions relying upon the antiretroactivity presumption have involved intervening statutes burdening private parties, we have applied the presumption in cases involving new monetary obligations that fell only on the
government. See United States v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., 276 U. S. 160
(1928); White v. United States, 191 U. S. 545 (1903).

spective operation, whereby rights previously vested are in-juriously affected, unless compelled to do so by language so

clear and positive as to leave no room to doubt that such wasthe intention of the legislature." Id., at 559.

Our statement in Bowen that "congressional enactmentsand administrative rules will not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result,"488 U. S., at 208, was in step with this long line of cases.

26

Bowen itself was a paradigmatic case of retroactivity inwhich a federal agency sought to recoup, under cost limit

regulations issued in 1984, funds that had been paid to hospi-tals for services rendered earlier, see

id., at 207; our searchfor clear congressional intent authorizing retroactivity was

consistent with the approach taken in decisions spanningtwo centuries.

The presumption against statutory retroactivity had spe-cial force in the era in which courts tended to view legislative
interference with property and contract rights circum-spectly. In this century, legislation has come to supply the
dominant means of legal ordering, and circumspection hasgiven way to greater deference to legislative judgments.
See Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U. S., at15-16; Home Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U. S.
398, 436-444 (1934). But while the constitutional impedi-ments to retroactive civil legislation are now modest, prospectivity remains the appropriate default rule. Becauseit accords with widely held intuitions about how statutes
ordinarily operate, a presumption against retroactivity willgenerally coincide with legislative and public expectations.
Requiring clear intent assures that Congress itself hasaffirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable price

to pay for the countervailing benefits. Such a requirementallocates to Congress responsibility for fundamental policy

judgments concerning the proper temporal reach of statutes,and has the additional virtue of giving legislators a predictable background rule against which to legislate.

B
Although we have long embraced a presumption againststatutory retroactivity, for just as long we have recognized

that, in many situations, a court should "apply the law ineffect at the time it renders its decision," Bradley, 416 U. S.,
at 711, even though that law was enacted after the eventsthat gave rise to the suit. There is, of course, no conflict
between that principle and a presumption against retroac-tivity when the statute in question is unambiguous. Chief
Justice Marshall's opinion in United States v. Schooner
Peggy, 1 Cranch 103 (1801), illustrates this point. Becausea treaty signed on September 30, 1800, while the case was

pending on appeal, unambiguously provided for the restora-tion of captured property "not yet definitively condemned,"
id., at 107 (emphasis in original), we reversed a decree en-tered on September 23, 1800, condemning a French vessel
that had been seized in American waters. Our applicationof "the law in effect" at the time of our decision in

SchoonerPeggy was simply a response to the language of the statute.

Id., at 109.Even absent specific legislative authorization, application
of new statutes passed after the events in suit is unquestion-ably proper in many situations. When the intervening statute authorizes or affects the propriety of prospective relief,application of the new provision is not retroactive. Thus, in
American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council, 257 U. S. 184 (1921), we held that $ 20 of the Clayton Act,enacted while the case was pending on appeal, governed the

propriety of injunctive relief against labor picketing. In re-manding the suit for application of the intervening statute,

274 LANDGRAF v. USI FILM PRODUCTS

Opinion of the Court
we observed that "relief by injunction operates in futuro,"and that the plaintiff had no "vested right" in the decree

entered by the trial court. 257 U. S., at 201. See also, e. g.,Hall v. Beals, 396 U. S. 45, 48 (1969); Duplex Printing Press
Co. v. Deering, 254 U. S. 443, 464 (1921).We have regularly applied intervening statutes conferring
or ousting jurisdiction, whether or not jurisdiction lay whenthe underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed.
Thus, in Bruner v. United States, 343 U. S. 112, 116-117(1952), relying on our "consisten[t]" practice, we ordered an
action dismissed because the jurisdictional statute under
which it had been (properly) filed was subsequently repealed.27 See also Hallowell v. Commons, 239 U. S. 506,508-509 (1916);

Assessors v. Osbornes, 9 Wall. 567, 575 (1870).Conversely, in
Andrus v. Charlestone Stone Products Co.,
436 U. S. 604, 607-608, n. 6 (1978), we held that, becausea statute passed while the case was pending on appeal

had eliminated the amount-in-controversy requirement for
federal-question cases, the fact that respondent had failed toallege $10,000 in controversy at the commencement of the

action was "now of no moment." See also United States v.
Alabama, 362 U. S. 602, 604 (1960) (per curiam); Stephens
v. Cherokee Nation, 174 U. S. 445, 478 (1899). Applicationof a new jurisdictional rule usually "takes away no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal that is to hear the
case." Hallowell, 239 U. S., at 508. Present law normallygoverns in such situations because jurisdictional statutes

"speak to the power of the court rather than to the rights orobligations of the parties,"

Republic Nat. Bank of Miami,
506 U. S., at 100 (Thomas, J., concurring).

27 In Bruner, we specifically noted:
"This jurisdictional rule does not affect the general principle that a statute is not to be given retroactive effect unless such construction is required by explicit language or by necessary implication. Compare United
States v. St. Louis, S. F. & T. R. Co., 270 U. S. 1, 3 (1926), with Smallwood
v. Gallardo, 275 U. S. 56, 61 (1927)." 343 U. S., at 117, n. 8.

Opinion of the Court
Changes in procedural rules may often be applied in suits
arising before their enactment without raising concerns
about retroactivity. For example, in Ex parte Collett, 337
U. S. 55, 71 (1949), we held that 28 U. S. C. $ 1404(a) governed
the transfer of an action instituted prior to that statute's
enactment. We noted the diminished reliance interests in
matters of procedure. 337 U. S., at 71.28 Because rules of
procedure regulate secondary rather than primary conduct,
the fact that a new procedural rule was instituted after the
conduct giving rise to the suit does not make application of
the rule at trial retroactive. Cf. McBurney v. Carson, 99
U. S. 567, 569 (1879).29

28 While we have strictly construed the Ex Post Facto Clause to prohibit
application of new statutes creating or increasing punishments after the
fact, we have upheld intervening procedural changes even if application
of the new rule operated to a defendant's disadvantage in the particular
case. See, e. g., Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282, 293-294 (1977); see
also Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37 (1990); Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U. S.
167 (1925).

29 Of course, the mere fact that a new rule is procedural does not mean

that it applies to every pending case. A new rule concerning the filing of
complaints would not govern an action in which the complaint had already
been properly filed under the old regime, and the promulgation of a new
rule of evidence would not require an appellate remand for a new trial.
Our orders approving amendments to federal procedural rules reflect the
commonsense notion that the applicability of such provisions ordinarily
depends on the posture of the particular case. See, e. g., Order Amending
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 495 U. S. 969 (1990) (amendments
applicable to pending cases "insofar as just and practicable"); Order
Amending Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 456 U. S. 1015 (1982) (same);
Order Amending Bankruptcy Rules and Forms, 421 U. S. 1021 (1975)
(amendments applicable to pending cases "except to the extent that in the
opinion of the court their application in a particular proceeding then pending would not be feasible or would work injustice"). Contrary to Justice
Scalia's suggestion, post, at 290, we do not restrict the presumption
against statutory retroactivity to cases involving "vested rights." (Neither is Justice Story's definition of retroactivity, quoted supra, at 269, so
restricted.) Nor do we suggest that concerns about retroactivity have no
application to procedural rules.

Opinion of the Court
Petitioner relies principally upon Bradley v. School Bd.
of Richmond, 416 U. S. 696 (1974), and Thorpe v. Housing
Authority of Durham, 393 U. S. 268 (1969), in support of
her argument that our ordinary interpretive rules support
application of $ 102 to her case. In Thorpe, we held that an
agency circular requiring a local housing authority to give
notice of reasons and opportunity to respond before evicting
a tenant was applicable to an eviction proceeding commenced
before the regulation issued. Thorpe shares much with both
the "procedural" and "prospective-relief " cases. See supra,
at 273-275. Thus, we noted in Thorpe that new hearing procedures did not affect either party's obligations under the
lease agreement between the housing authority and the petitioner, 393 U. S., at 279, and, because the tenant had "not yet
vacated," we saw no significance in the fact that the housing
authority had "decided to evict her before the circular was
issued," id., at 283. The Court in Thorpe viewed the new
eviction procedures as "essential to remove a serious impediment to the successful protection of constitutional rights."
Ibid.30 Cf. Youakim v. Miller, 425 U. S. 231, 237 (1976) (per
curiam) (citing Thorpe for propriety of applying new law to
avoiding necessity of deciding constitutionality of old one).

Our holding in Bradley is similarly compatible with the
line of decisions disfavoring "retroactive" application of statutes. In Bradley, the District Court had awarded attorney's fees and costs, upon general equitable principles, to
parents who had prevailed in an action seeking to desegregate the public schools of Richmond, Virginia. While the

30 Thorpe is consistent with the principle, analogous to that at work in
the common-law presumption about repeals of criminal statutes, that the
government should accord grace to private parties disadvantaged by an
old rule when it adopts a new and more generous one. Cf. DeGurules v.
INS, 833 F. 2d 861, 862-863 (CA9 1987). Indeed, Thorpe twice cited
United States v. Chambers, 291 U. S. 217 (1934), which ordered dismissal
of prosecutions pending when the National Prohibition Act was repealed.
See Thorpe, 393 U. S., at 281, n. 38; id., at 282, n. 40.

Opinion of the Court
case was pending before the Court of Appeals, Congress en-acted $ 718 of the Education Amendments of 1972, which authorized federal courts to award the prevailing parties inschool desegregation cases a reasonable attorney's fee. The
Court of Appeals held that the new fee provision did not
authorize the award of fees for services rendered before theeffective date of the amendments. This Court reversed.

We concluded that the private parties could rely on $ 718 tosupport their claim for attorney's fees, resting our decision
"on the principle that a court is to apply the law in effect atthe time it renders its decision, unless doing so would result
in manifest injustice or there is statutory direction or legislative history to the contrary." 416 U. S., at 711.

Although that language suggests a categorical presumption in favor of application of all new rules of law, we now
make it clear that Bradley did not alter the well-settled presumption against application of the class of new statutes that
would have genuinely "retroactive" effect. Like the new
hearing requirement in Thorpe, the attorney's fee provision
at issue in Bradley did not resemble the cases in which we
have invoked the presumption against statutory retroactivity. Attorney's fee determinations, we have observed, are
"collateral to the main cause of action" and "uniquely separable from the cause of action to be proved at trial." White
v. New Hampshire Dept. of Employment Security, 455 U. S.
445, 451-452 (1982). See also Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678,
695, n. 24 (1978). Moreover, even before the enactment of

$ 718, federal courts had authority (which the District Court
in Bradley had exercised) to award fees based upon equitable
principles. As our opinion in Bradley made clear, it would
be difficult to imagine a stronger equitable case for an attorney's fee award than a lawsuit in which the plaintiff parents
would otherwise have to bear the costs of desegregating
their children's public schools. See 416 U. S., at 718 (noting
that the plaintiffs had brought the school board "into compliance with its constitutional mandate") (citing Brown v. Board

Opinion of the Court
of Education, 347 U. S. 483, 494 (1954)). In light of the prioravailability of a fee award, and the likelihood that fees would

be assessed under pre-existing theories, we concluded thatthe new fee statute simply "d[id] not impose an additional or
unforeseeable obligation" upon the school board. Bradley,416 U. S., at 721.

In approving application of the new fee provision, Bradleydid not take issue with the long line of decisions applying
the presumption against retroactivity. Our opinion distin-guished, but did not criticize, prior cases that had applied
the antiretroactivity canon. See id., at 720 (citing Greene v.
United States, 376 U. S. 149, 160 (1964); Claridge Apartments Co. v. Commissioner, 323 U. S. 141, 164 (1944), andUnion Pacific R. Co. v. Laramie Stock Yards Co., 231 U. S.

190, 199 (1913)). The authorities we relied upon in Bradleylend further support to the conclusion that we did not intend
to displace the traditional presumption against applying stat-utes affecting substantive rights, liabilities, or duties to conduct arising before their enactment. See Kaiser, 494 U. S.,at 849-850 (

Scalia, J., concurring). Bradley relied onThorpe and on other precedents that are consistent with a

presumption against statutory retroactivity, including deci-sions involving explicitly retroactive statutes, see 416 U. S.,
at 713, n. 17 (citing, inter alia, Freeborn v. Smith, 2 Wall. 160(1865)),

31 the retroactive application of intervening judicial

decisions, see 416 U. S., at 713-714, n. 17 (citing, inter alia,
Patterson v. Alabama, 294 U. S. 600, 607 (1935)),32 statutes

31 In Bradley, we cited Schooner Peggy for the "current law" principle,
but we recognized that the law at issue in Schooner Peggy had expressly
called for retroactive application. See 416 U. S., at 712, n. 16 (describing
Schooner Peggy as holding that Court was obligated to "apply the terms
of the convention," which had recited that it applied to all vessels not yet
"definitively condemned") (emphasis in convention).

32 At the time Bradley was decided, it was by no means a truism to point

out that rules announced in intervening judicial decisions should normally
be applied to a case pending when the intervening decision came down.
In 1974, our doctrine on judicial retroactivity involved a substantial measure of discretion, guided by equitable standards resembling the Bradley

of a criminal statute, 416 U. S., at 713, n. 17 (citing UnitedStates v. Chambers, 291 U. S. 217 (1934)). Moreover, in none

97, 106-107 (1971); Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618, 636 (1965). While
it was accurate in 1974 to say that a new rule announced in a judicial
decision was only presumptively applicable to pending cases, we have
since established a firm rule of retroactivity. See Harper v. Virginia
Dept. of Taxation, 509 U. S. 86 (1993); Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314
(1987).

Opinion of the Court
When a case implicates a federal statute enacted after theevents in suit, the court's first task is to determine whether

Congress has expressly prescribed the statute's properreach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need
to resort to judicial default rules. When, however, the stat-ute contains no such express command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect,
i. e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed whenhe acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or

impose new duties with respect to transactions alreadycompleted. If the statute would operate retroactively, our
traditional presumption teaches that it does not governabsent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.

V
We now ask whether, given the absence of guiding instruc-tions from Congress, $ 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 is

the type of provision that should govern cases arising beforeits enactment. As we observed

supra, at 260-261, and n. 12,there is no special reason to think that all the diverse provisions of the Act must be treated uniformly for such purposes.To the contrary, we understand the instruction that the provisions are to "take effect upon enactment" to mean thatcourts should evaluate each provision of the Act in light of
ordinary judicial principles concerning the application of newrules to pending cases and preenactment conduct.

Two provisions of $ 102 may be readily classified accordingto these principles. The jury trial right set out in $ 102(c)(1)
is plainly a procedural change of the sort that would ordi-narily govern in trials conducted after its effective date. If

$ 102 did no more than introduce a right to jury trial in Title
to remand to agency under Thorpe for administrative findings required by
new regulation because administrative record was already adequate for
judicial review); Hall v. Beals, 396 U. S. 45, 48 (1969) (in action for injunctive relief from state election statute, citing Thorpe as authority for considering intervening amendment of statute).

VII cases, the provision would presumably apply to casestried after November 21, 1991, regardless of when the underlying conduct occurred.34 However, because $ 102(c) makesa jury trial available only "[i]f a complaining party seeks
compensatory or punitive damages," the jury trial optionmust stand or fall with the attached damages provisions.

Section 102(b)(1) is clearly on the other side of the line.That subsection authorizes punitive damages if the plaintiff
shows that the defendant "engaged in a discriminatory prac-tice or discriminatory practices with malice or with reckless
indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrievedindividual." The very labels given "punitive" or "exemplary" damages, as well as the rationales that support them,demonstrate that they share key characteristics of criminal sanctions. Retroactive imposition of punitive damageswould raise a serious constitutional question. See Turner
Elkhorn, 428 U. S., at 17 (Court would "hesitate to approvethe retrospective imposition of liability on any theory of deterrence . . . or blameworthiness"); De Veau v. Braisted, 363U. S. 144, 160 (1960) ("The mark of an

ex post facto law isthe imposition of what can fairly be designated punishment

for past acts"). See also Louis Vuitton S. A. v. SpencerHandbags Corp., 765 F. 2d 966, 972 (CA2 1985) (retroactive
application of punitive treble damages provisions of Trade-mark Counterfeiting Act of 1984 "would present a potential
ex post facto problem"). Before we entertained that ques-tion, we would have to be confronted with a statute that
explicitly authorized punitive damages for preenactment con-duct. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 contains no such explicit command.The provision of $ 102(a)(1) authorizing the recovery of
compensatory damages is not easily classified. It does not

34 As the Court of Appeals recognized, however, the promulgation of a
new jury trial rule would ordinarily not warrant retrial of cases that had
previously been tried to a judge. See n. 29, supra. Thus, customary
practice would not support remand for a jury trial in this case.

make unlawful conduct that was lawful when it occurred; aswe have noted, supra, at 252-255, $ 102 only reaches discriminatory conduct already prohibited by Title VII. Concernsabout a lack of fair notice are further muted by the fact that
such discrimination was in many cases (although not thisone) already subject to monetary liability in the form of
backpay. Nor could anyone seriously contend that the com-pensatory damages provisions smack of a "retributive" or
other suspect legislative purpose. Section 102 reflects Con-gress' desire to afford victims of discrimination more complete redress for violations of rules established more than ageneration ago in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. At least
with respect to its compensatory damages provisions, then,$ 102 is not in a category in which objections to retroactive
application on grounds of fairness have their greatest force.Nonetheless, the new compensatory damages provision
would operate "retrospectively" if it were applied to con-duct occurring before November 21, 1991. Unlike certain
other forms of relief, compensatory damages are quintes-sentially backward looking. Compensatory damages may be
intended less to sanction wrongdoers than to make victimswhole, but they do so by a mechanism that affects the liabilities of defendants. They do not "compensate" by distribut-ing funds from the public coffers, but by requiring particular
employers to pay for harms they caused. The introductionof a right to compensatory damages is also the type of legal
change that would have an impact on private parties' plan-ning.

35 In this case, the event to which the new damages

35 As petitioner and amici suggest, concerns of unfair surprise and upsetting expectations are attenuated in the case of intentional employment
discrimination, which has been unlawful for more than a generation. However, fairness concerns would not be entirely absent if the damages provisions of $ 102 were to apply to events preceding its enactment, as the facts
of this case illustrate. Respondent USI's management, when apprised of
the wrongful conduct of petitioner's co-worker, took timely action to remedy the problem. The law then in effect imposed no liability on an employer who corrected discriminatory work conditions before the conditions

provision relates is the discriminatory conduct of respondents' agent John Williams; if applied here, that provision
would attach an important new legal burden to that conduct.
The new damages remedy in $ 102, we conclude, is the kind
of provision that does not apply to events antedating its enactment in the absence of clear congressional intent.

In cases like this one, in which prior law afforded no relief,

$ 102 can be seen as creating a new cause of action, and its
impact on parties' rights is especially pronounced. Section
102 confers a new right to monetary relief on persons like
petitioner who were victims of a hostile work environment
but were not constructively discharged, and the novel prospect of damages liability for their employers. Because Title
VII previously authorized recovery of backpay in some
cases, and because compensatory damages under $ 102(a) are
in addition to any backpay recoverable, the new provision
also resembles a statute increasing the amount of damages
available under a preestablished cause of action. Even
under that view, however, the provision would, if applied in
cases arising before the Act's effective date, undoubtedly impose on employers found liable a "new disability" in respect
to past events. See Society for Propagation of the Gospel,
22 F. Cas., at 767. The extent of a party's liability, in the
civil context as well as the criminal, is an important legal

became so severe as to result in the victim's constructive discharge. Assessing damages against respondents on a theory of respondeat superior
would thus entail an element of surprise. Even when the conduct in question is morally reprehensible or illegal, a degree of unfairness is inherent
whenever the law imposes additional burdens based on conduct that occurred in the past. Cf. Weaver, 450 U. S., at 28-30 (Ex Post Facto Clause
assures fair notice and governmental restraint, and does not turn on "an
individual's right to less punishment"). The new damages provisions of

$ 102 can be expected to give managers an added incentive to take preventive measures to ward off discriminatory conduct by subordinates before
it occurs, but that purpose is not served by applying the regime to preenactment conduct.

consequence that cannot be ignored.36 Neither in Bradleyitself, nor in any case before or since in which Congress had

not clearly spoken, have we read a statute substantially in-creasing the monetary liability of a private party to apply to
conduct occurring before the statute's enactment. See Winfree v. Northern Pacific R. Co., 227 U. S. 296, 301 (1913) (stat-ute creating new federal cause of action for wrongful death

36 The state courts have consistently held that statutes changing or abolishing limits on the amount of damages available in wrongful-death actions
should not, in the absence of clear legislative intent, apply to actions arising before their enactment. See, e. g., Dempsey v. State, 451 A. 2d 273
(R. I. 1982) ("Every court which has considered the issue . . . has found
that a subsequent change as to the amount or the elements of damage in

It will frequently be true, as petitioner and amici forcefully argue here, that retroactive application of a new statute
would vindicate its purpose more fully.38 That consider37 We have sometimes said that new "remedial" statutes, like new "procedural" ones, should presumptively apply to pending cases. See, e. g.,
Ex parte Collett, 337 U. S., at 71, and n. 38 ("Clearly, $ 1404(a) is a remedial
provision applicable to pending actions"); Beazell, 269 U. S., at 171 (Ex
Post Facto Clause does not limit "legislative control of remedies and
modes of procedure which do not affect matters of substance"). While
that statement holds true for some kinds of remedies, see supra, at 273-
274 (discussing prospective relief), we have not classified a statute introducing damages liability as the sort of "remedial" change that should
presumptively apply in pending cases. "Retroactive modification" of
damages remedies may "normally harbo[r] much less potential for mischief
than retroactive changes in the principles of liability," Hastings v. Earth
Satellite Corp., 628 F. 2d 85, 93 (CADC), cert. denied, 449 U. S. 905 (1980),
but that potential is nevertheless still significant.

38 Petitioner argues that our decision in Franklin v. Gwinnett County

Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60 (1992), supports application of $ 102 to her
case. Relying on the principle that "where legal rights have been invaded, and a federal statute provides for a general right to sue for such
invasion, federal courts may use any available remedy to make good the
wrong,' " id., at 66 (quoting Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684 (1946)), we
held in Franklin that the right of action under Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972 included a claim for damages. Petitioner argues
that Franklin supports her position because, if she cannot obtain damages
pursuant to $ 102, she will be left remediless despite an adjudged violation
of her right under Title VII to be free of workplace discrimination. However, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is not a statute to which we
would apply the "traditional presumption in favor of all available remedies." 503 U. S., at 72. That statute did not create a "general right to
sue" for employment discrimination, but instead specified a set of "circumscribed remedies." See United States v. Burke, 504 U. S. 229, 240 (1992).
Until the 1991 amendment, the Title VII scheme did not allow for dam511us1$40I 11-04-97 19:35:17 PAGES OPINPGT

ation, however, is not sufficient to rebut the presumptionagainst retroactivity. Statutes are seldom crafted to pursue

a single goal, and compromises necessary to their enactmentmay require adopting means other than those that would
most effectively pursue the main goal. A legislator whosupported a prospective statute might reasonably oppose
retroactive application of the same statute. Indeed, there isreason to believe that the omission of the 1990 version's express retroactivity provisions was a factor in the passage ofthe 1991 bill. Section 102 is plainly not the sort of provision
that must be understood to operate retroactively because acontrary reading would render it ineffective.

The presumption against statutory retroactivity isfounded upon sound considerations of general policy and
practice, and accords with long held and widely shared ex-pectations about the usual operation of legislation. We are
satisfied that it applies to $ 102. Because we have found noclear evidence of congressional intent that $ 102 of the Civil
Rights Act of 1991 should apply to cases arising before itsenactment, we conclude that the judgment of the Court of
Appeals must be affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Aluminum & Chemical Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U. S. 827, 840(1990) (

Scalia, J., concurring). The Court, however, is will-ing to let that clear statement be supplied, not by the text

of the law in question, but by individual legislators who par-ticipated in the enactment of the law, and even legislators in
an earlier Congress which tried and failed to enact a similarlaw. For the Court not only combs the floor debate and
Committee Reports of the statute at issue, the Civil RightsAct of 1991 (1991 Act), Pub. L. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071, see
ante, at 262-263, but also reviews the procedural history ofan earlier, unsuccessful, attempt by a different Congress to
enact similar legislation, the Civil Rights Act of 1990, S. 2104,101st Cong., 1st Sess. (1990), see

ante, at 255-257, 263.This effectively converts the "clear statement" rule into a

"discernible legislative intent" rule--and even that under-states the difference. The Court's rejection of the floor
statements of certain Senators because they are "franklypartisan" and "cannot plausibly be read as reflecting any general agreement," ante, at 262, reads like any other exercisein the soft science of legislative historicizing,

by any distinctive "clear statement" requirement. If it is a"clear statement" we are seeking, surely it is not enough to

insist that the statement can "plausibly be read as reflectinggeneral agreement"; the statement must clearly reflect
general agreement. No legislative history can do that, ofcourse, but only the text of the statute itself. That has been
the meaning of the "clear statement" retroactivity rule fromthe earliest times. See,

e. g., United States v. Heth, 3Cranch 399, 408 (1806) (Johnson, J.) ("Unless, therefore, the

words make that imperative"); see also Bonjorno, supra, at842-844 (concurring opinion) (collecting cases applying the
clear statement test). I do not deem that clear rule to bechanged by the Court's dicta regarding legislative history in
the present case.The 1991 Act does not expressly state that it operates retroactively, but petitioner contends that its specification ofprospective-only application for two sections, $$ 109(c) and
402(b), implies that its other provisions are retroactive.More precisely, petitioner argues that since $ 402(a) states
that "[e]xcept as otherwise specifically provided, [the 1991Act] shall take effect upon enactment"; and since $$ 109(c)
and 402(b) specifically provide that those sections shall oper-ate only prospectively; the term "shall take effect upon enactment" in $ 402(a) must mean retroactive effect. Theshort response to this refined and subtle argument is that
refinement and subtlety are no substitute for clear state-ment. "[S]hall take effect upon enactment" is presumed to
mean "shall have prospective effect upon enactment," andthat presumption is too strong to be overcome by any negative inference derived from $$ 109(c) and 402(b).2

2 Petitioner suggests that in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S.
1 (1989), the Court found the negative implication of language sufficient to
satisfy the "clear statement" requirement for congressional subjection of
the States to private suit, see Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473
U. S. 234, 242 (1985). However, in that case it was the express inclusion
of States in the definition of potentially liable "person[s]," see 42 U. S. C.

$ 9601(21), as reinforced by the limitation of States' liability in certain
limited circumstances, see $ 9601(20)(D), that led the Court to find a plain
statement of liability. See 491 U. S., at 11 (noting the "cascade of plain

II
The Court's opinion begins with an evaluation of petition-er's argument that the text of the statute dictates its retroactive application. The Court's rejection of that argumentcannot be as forceful as it ought, so long as it insists upon
compromising the clarity of the ancient and constant assump-tion that legislation is prospective, by attributing a comparable pedigree to the nouveau Bradley presumption in favor ofapplying the law in effect at the time of decision. See

Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U. S. 696, 711-716 (1974).As I have demonstrated elsewhere and need not repeat here,

Bradley and Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham, 393U. S. 268 (1969), simply misread our precedents and invented
an utterly new and erroneous rule. See generally Bon-jorno, supra, at 840 (

Scalia, J., concurring).Besides embellishing the pedigree of the

Bradley-Thorpepresumption, the Court goes out of its way to reaffirm the

holdings of those cases. I see nothing to be gained by over-ruling them, but neither do I think the indefensible should
needlessly be defended. And Thorpe, at least, is really inde-fensible. The regulation at issue there required that "before instituting an eviction proceeding local housing authori-ties . . . should inform the tenant . . . of the reasons for the
eviction . . . ." Thorpe, supra, at 272, and n. 8 (emphasisadded). The Court imposed that requirement on an eviction
proceeding instituted 18 months before the regulation is-sued. That application was plainly retroactive and was
wrong. The result in Bradley presents a closer question;application of an attorney's fees provision to ongoing litigation is arguably not retroactive. If it were retroactive, how-ever, it would surely not be saved (as the Court suggests)
by the existence of another theory under which attorney'sfees might have been discretionarily awarded, see

My last, and most significant, disagreement with theCourt's analysis of this case pertains to the meaning of retroactivity. The Court adopts as its own the definition craftedby Justice Story in a case involving a provision of the New
Hampshire Constitution that prohibited "retrospective"laws: a law is retroactive only if it "takes away or impairs
vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creates a newobligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability,
in respect to transactions or considerations already past."Society for Propagation of the Gospel v. Wheeler, 22 F. Cas.
756, 767 (No. 13,156) (CC NH 1814) (Story, J.).One might expect from this "vested rights" focus that the
Court would hold all changes in rules of procedure (as op-posed to matters of substance) to apply retroactively. And
one would draw the same conclusion from the Court's formu-lation of the test as being "whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed beforeits enactment"--a test borrowed directly from our

Ex PostFacto Clause jurisprudence, see, e. g., Miller v. Florida, 482

U. S. 423, 430 (1987), where we have adopted a substantive-procedural line, see id., at 433 ("[N]o ex post facto violation
occurs if the change in the law is merely procedural"). Infact, however, the Court shrinks from faithfully applying the
test that it has announced. It first seemingly defends theprocedural-substantive distinction that a "vested rights" theory entails, ante, at 275 ("Because rules of procedure regu-late secondary rather than primary conduct, the fact that a
new procedural rule was instituted after the conduct givingrise to the suit does not make application of the rule at trial
retroactive"). But it soon acknowledges a broad and ill-defined (indeed, utterly undefined) exception: "[T]he mere
fact that a new rule is procedural does not mean that it ap-plies to every pending case." Ante, at 275, n. 29. Under
this exception, "a new rule concerning the filing of com-plaints would not govern an action in which the complaint

had already been properly filed," ibid., and "the promulga-tion of a new jury trial rule would ordinarily not warrant

retrial of cases that had previously been tried to a judge,"
ante, at 281, n. 34. It is hard to see how either of these
refusals to allow retroactive application preserves any
"vested right." " `No one has a vested right in any givenmode of procedure.' "

Ex parte Collett, 337 U. S. 55, 71
(1949), quoting Crane v. Hahlo, 258 U. S. 142, 147 (1922).The seemingly random exceptions to the Court's "vested

rights" (substance-vs.-procedure) criterion must be made, Isuggest, because that criterion is fundamentally wrong. It
may well be that the upsetting of "vested substantive rights"
was the proper touchstone for interpretation of New Hampshire's constitutional prohibition, as it is for interpretation of
the United States Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clauses, see
ante, at 275, n. 28. But I doubt that it has anything to do
with the more mundane question before us here: absent clear
statement to the contrary, what is the presumed temporal
application of a statute? For purposes of that question, a
procedural change should no more be presumed to be retroactive than a substantive one. The critical issue, I think,
is not whether the rule affects "vested rights," or governs
substance or procedure, but rather what is the relevant activity that the rule regulates. Absent clear statement otherwise, only such relevant activity which occurs after the
effective date of the statute is covered. Most statutes are
meant to regulate primary conduct, and hence will not be
applied in trials involving conduct that occurred before their
effective date. But other statutes have a different purpose
and therefore a different relevant retroactivity event. A
new rule of evidence governing expert testimony, for example, is aimed at regulating the conduct of trial, and the event
relevant to retroactivity of the rule is introduction of the
testimony. Even though it is a procedural rule, it would unquestionably not be applied to testimony already taken--
reversing a case on appeal, for example, because the new

Scalia, J., concurring in judgments
rule had not been applied at a trial which antedated thestatute.

The inadequacy of the Court's "vested rights" approachbecomes apparent when a change in one of the incidents of
trial alters substantive entitlements. The opinion classifies
attorney's fees provisions as procedural and permits "retro-active" application (in the sense of application to cases involving preenactment conduct). See ante, at 277-278. Itseems to me, however, that holding a person liable for attorney's fees affects a "substantive right" no less than holdinghim liable for compensatory or punitive damages, which the
Court treats as affecting a vested right. If attorney's fees
can be awarded in a suit involving conduct that antedated
the fee-authorizing statute, it is because the purpose of the
fee award is not to affect that conduct, but to encourage suit
for the vindication of certain rights--so that the retroactivity event is the filing of suit, whereafter encouragement is
no longer needed. Or perhaps because the purpose of the
fee award is to facilitate suit--so that the retroactivity event
is the termination of suit, whereafter facilitation can no
longer be achieved.

The "vested rights" test does not square with our consistent practice of giving immediate effect to statutes that alter
a court's jurisdiction. See, e. g., Bruner v. United States,
343 U. S. 112, 116-117, and n. 8 (1952); Hallowell v. Commons, 239 U. S. 506 (1916); cf. Ex parte McCardle, 7 Wall.
506, 514 (1869); Insurance Co. v. Ritchie, 5 Wall. 541, 544-545
(1867); see also King v. Justices of the Peace of London, 3
Burr. 1456, 97 Eng. Rep. 924 (K. B. 1764). The Court explains this aspect of our retroactivity jurisprudence by noting that "a new jurisdictional rule" will often not involve
retroactivity in Justice Story's sense because it " `takes away
no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal that is
to hear the case.' " Ante, at 274, quoting Hallowell, supra,
at 508. That may be true sometimes, but surely not always.

cases are explained, I think, by the fact that the purposeof provisions conferring or eliminating jurisdiction is to permit or forbid the exercise of judicial power--so that the rele-vant event for retroactivity purposes is the moment at which
that power is sought to be exercised. Thus, applying ajurisdiction-eliminating statute to undo past judicial action
would be applying it retroactively; but applying it to preventany judicial action after the statute takes effect is applying
it prospectively.Finally, statutes eliminating previously available forms of
prospective relief provide another challenge to the Court'sapproach. Courts traditionally withhold requested injunctions that are not authorized by then-current law, even ifthey were authorized at the time suit commenced and at the
time the primary conduct sought to be enjoined was firstengaged in. See,

e. g., American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council, 257 U. S. 184 (1921); Duplex

Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 254 U. S. 443, 464 (1921). Thereason, which has nothing to do with whether it is possible
to have a vested right to prospective relief, is that "[o]bvi-ously, this form of relief operates only in futuro," ibid.
Since the purpose of prospective relief is to affect the futurerather than remedy the past, the relevant time for judging
its retroactivity is the very moment at which it is ordered.3

3 A focus on the relevant retroactivity event also explains why the presumption against retroactivity is not violated by interpreting a statute
to alter the future legal effect of past transactions--so-called secondary
retroactivity, see Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 219-
220 (1988) (Scalia, J., concurring) (citing McNulty, Corporations and the
Intertemporal Conflict of Laws, 55 Calif. L. Rev. 12, 58-60 (1967)); cf. Cox
v. Hart, 260 U. S. 427, 435 (1922). A new ban on gambling applies to
existing casinos and casinos under construction, see ante, at 269-270, n. 24,
even though it "attaches a new disability" to those past investments. The

Blackmun, J., dissenting
I do not maintain that it will always be easy to determine,from the statute's purpose, the relevant event for assessing

its retroactivity. As I have suggested, for example, a statu-tory provision for attorney's fees presents a difficult case.
Ordinarily, however, the answer is clear--as it is in both
Landgraf and Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., post, p. 298.Unlike the Court, I do not think that any of the provisions

at issue is "not easily classified," ante, at 281. They are alldirected at the regulation of primary conduct, and the occurrence of the primary conduct is the relevant event.

Justice Blackmun, dissenting.
Perhaps from an eagerness to resolve the "apparent ten-sion," see Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp. v. Bonjorno,

494 U. S. 827, 837 (1990), between Bradley v. School Bd. ofRichmond, 416 U. S. 696 (1974), and Bowen v. Georgetown
Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204 (1988), the Court rejects the"most logical reading," Kaiser, 494 U. S., at 838, of the Civil
Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat. 1071 (Act), and resorts to apresumption against retroactivity. This approach seems to
me to pay insufficient fidelity to the settled principle that the"starting point for interpretation of a statute `is the language
of the statute itself,' " Kaiser, 494 U. S., at 835, quoting Consumer Product Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447U. S. 102, 108 (1980), and extends the presumption against

retroactive legislation beyond its historical reach andpurpose.

A straightforward textual analysis of the Act indicatesthat $ 102's provision of compensatory damages and its attendant right to a jury trial apply to cases pending on appealon the date of enactment. This analysis begins with $ 402(a)
of the Act, 105 Stat. 1099: "Except as otherwise specificallyprovided, this Act and the amendments made by this Act

relevant retroactivity event is the primary activity of gambling, not the
primary activity of constructing casinos.

shall take effect upon enactment." Under the "settled rule
that a statute must, if possible, be construed in such fashion
that every word has operative effect," United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 36 (1992), citing United States
v. Menasche, 348 U. S. 528, 538-539 (1955), $ 402(a)'s qualifying clause, "[e]xcept as otherwise specifically provided,"
cannot be dismissed as mere surplusage or an "insurance policy" against future judicial interpretation. Cf. Gersman v.
Group Health Assn., Inc., 975 F. 2d 886, 890 (CADC 1992).
Instead, it most logically refers to the Act's two sections
"specifically provid[ing]" that the statute does not apply to
cases pending on the date of enactment: (a) $ 402(b), 105 Stat.
1099, which provides, in effect, that the Act did not apply to
the then-pending case of Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio,
490 U. S. 642 (1989), and (b) $ 109(c), 105 Stat. 1078, which
states that the Act's protections of overseas employment
"shall not apply with respect to conduct occurring before the
date of the enactment of this Act." Self-evidently, if the
entire Act were inapplicable to pending cases, $$ 402(b) and
109(c) would be "entirely redundant." Kungys v. United
States, 485 U. S. 759, 778 (1988) (plurality opinion). Thus,
the clear implication is that, while $$ 402(b) and 109(c) do not
apply to pending cases, other provisions--including $ 102--
do.1 " `Absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to

the contrary, [this] language must . . . be regarded as conclusive.' " Kaiser, 494 U. S., at 835, quoting Consumer Product
Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U. S., at 108.
The legislative history of the Act, featuring a welter of conflicting and "some frankly partisan" floor statements, ante,
at 262, but no committee report, evinces no such contrary

1 It is, of course, an "unexceptional" proposition that "a particular statute may in some circumstances implicitly authorize retroactive [application]." Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S. 204, 223 (1988)

legislative intent.2 Thus, I see no reason to dismiss as "un-likely," ante, at 259, the most natural reading of the statute,

in order to embrace some other reading that is also "possi-ble," ante, at 260.

Even if the language of the statute did not answer theretroactivity question, it would be appropriate under our
precedents to apply $ 102 to pending cases.3 The well-established presumption against retroactive legislation,
which serves to protect settled expectations, is grounded ina respect for vested rights. See,

e. g., Smead, The RuleAgainst Retroactive Legislation: A Basic Principle of Jurisprudence, 20 Minn. L. Rev. 775, 784 (1936) (retroactivity

2 Virtually every Court of Appeals to consider the application of the 1991
Act to pending cases has concluded that the legislative history provides
no reliable guidance. See, e. g., Gersman v. Group Health Assn., Inc., 975
F. 2d 886 (CADC 1992); Mozee v. American Commercial Marine Service
Co., 963 F. 2d 929 (CA7 1992).

The absence in the Act of the strong retroactivity language of the vetoed 1990 legislation, which would have applied the new law to final judgments as well as to pending cases, see H. R. 4000, 101st Cong., 2d Sess.,

$ 15(b)(3) (1990), reprinted at 136 Cong. Rec. H6829 (Aug. 3, 1990) (providing that "any final judgment entered prior to the date of the enactment of
this Act as to which the rights of any of the parties thereto have become
fixed and vested . . . shall be vacated in whole or in part if justice requires"
and the Constitution permits), is not instructive of Congress' intent with
respect to pending cases alone. Significantly, Congress also rejected language that put pending claims beyond the reach of the 1990 or 1991 Act.
See id., at H6747 (Michel-LaFalce amendment to 1990 Act) ("The amendments made by this Act shall not apply with respect to claims arising
before the date of enactment of this Act"); id., at H6768 (Michel-LaFalce
amendment rejected); 137 Cong. Rec. S3023 (daily ed. Mar. 12, 1991) (Sen.
Dole's introduction of S. 611, which included the 1990 Act's retroactivity
provision); id., at 13255, 13265-13266 (introduction and defeat of Michel
substitute for H. R. 1).

3 Directly at issue in this case are compensatory damages and the right

to a jury trial. While there is little unfairness in requiring an employer
to compensate the victims of intentional acts of discrimination, or to have
a jury determine those damages, the imposition of punitive damages for
preenactment conduct represents a more difficult question, one not
squarely addressed in this case and one on which I express no opinion.

doctrine developed as an "inhibition against a constructionwhich . . . would violate vested rights"). This presumption

need not be applied to remedial legislation, such as $ 102,that does not proscribe any conduct that was previously
legal. See Sampeyreac v. United States, 7 Pet. 222, 238(1833) ("Almost every law, providing a new remedy, affects
and operates upon causes of action existing at the time thelaw is passed");

Hastings v. Earth Satellite Corp., 628 F. 2d85, 93 (CADC) ("Modification of remedy merely adjusts the

extent, or method of enforcement, of liability in instances inwhich the possibility of liability previously was known"),

a law "affecting and changing vested rights" is "not under-stood to apply to

remedial statutes, which may be of a retro-spective nature, provided they do not impair contracts, or

disturb absolute vested rights").At no time within the last generation has an employer had
a vested right to engage in or to permit sexual harassment;" `there is no such thing as a vested right to do wrong.' "
Freeborn v. Smith, 2 Wall. 160, 175 (1865). See also 2 N.Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction $ 41.04, p. 349
(4th rev. ed. 1986) (procedural and remedial statutes that donot take away vested rights are presumed to apply to pending actions). Section 102 of the Act expands the remediesavailable for acts of intentional discrimination, but does not
alter the scope of the employee's basic right to be free fromdiscrimination or the employer's corresponding legal duty.
There is nothing unjust about holding an employer responsi-ble for injuries caused by conduct that has been illegal for
almost 30 years.Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

Syllabus

RIVERS et al. v. ROADWAY EXPRESS, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 92-938. Argued October 13, 1993--Decided April 26, 1994
Petitioners filed a complaint under, inter alia, 42 U. S. C. $ 1981, alleging

that respondent, their employer, had fired them on baseless charges because of their race and because they had insisted on the same procedural
protections in disciplinary proceedings that were afforded white employees. Before the trial, this Court issued Patterson v. McLean
Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 171, holding that $ 1981's prohibition against
racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts does
not apply to conduct that occurs after the formation of a contract and
that does not interfere with the right to enforce established contract
obligations. The District Court relied on Patterson in dismissing petitioners' discriminatory discharge claims. While their appeal was pending, the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (1991 Act or Act) became law, $ 101 of
which defines $ 1981's "make and enforce contracts" phrase to embrace
all phases and incidents of the contractual relationship, including discriminatory contract terminations. The Court of Appeals ruled, among
other things, that $ 1981 as interpreted in Patterson, not as amended by

$ 101, governed the case.

Held: Section 101 does not apply to a case that arose before it was enacted. Pp. 303-314.

(a) Landgraf v. USI Film Products, ante, p. 244, in which this Court
concluded that $ 102 of the 1991 Act does not apply to cases arising before its enactment, requires rejection of two of petitioners' submissions
in this case: their negative implication argument based on $$ 402(a),
109(c), and 402(b), see ante, at 257-263, and their argument that Bradley
v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U. S. 696, controls here, rather than the
presumption against statutory retroactivity. Pp. 303-304.

(b) The fact that $ 101 was enacted in response to Patterson does not
supply sufficient evidence of a clear congressional intent to overcome
the presumption against statutory retroactivity. Even assuming that

$ 101 reflects disapproval of Patterson's $ 1981 interpretation, and that
most legislators believed that the case was incorrectly decided and represented a departure from the previously prevailing understanding of

$ 1981's reach, the Act's text does not support petitioners' argument that

$ 101 was intended to "restore" that prior understanding as to cases
arising before the Act's passage. In contrast to the 1990 civil rights

bill that was vetoed by the President, the 1991 Act neither declares its
intent to "restor[e]" protections that were limited by Patterson and
other decisions nor provides that its $ 1981 amendment applies to all
proceedings "pending on or commenced after" the date Patterson was
decided, but describes its function as "expanding" the scope of relevant
civil rights statutes in order to provide adequate protection to discrimination victims. Taken by itself, the fact that $ 101 is framed as a gloss
on $ 1981's original "make and enforce contracts" language does not
demonstrate an intent to apply the new definition to past acts. Altering statutory definitions, or adding new definitions of terms previously
undefined, is a common way of amending statutes, and simply does not
answer the retroactivity question. The 1991 Act's legislative history
does not bridge the textual gap, since the statements that most strongly
support retroactivity are found in the debates on the 1990 bill, and the
statements relating specifically to $ 101 are conflicting and unreliable.
Pp. 304-309.

(c) Contrary to petitioners' argument, this Court's decisions do not
espouse a "presumption" in favor of the retroactive application of restorative statutes even in the absence of clear congressional intent. Frisbie v. Whitney, 9 Wall. 187, and Freeborn v. Smith, 2 Wall. 160, distinguished. A restorative purpose may be relevant to whether Congress
specifically intended a new statute to govern past conduct, but an intent
to act retroactively in such cases must be based on clear evidence and
may not be presumed. Since neither $ 101 nor the statute of which it is
a part contains such evidence, and since the section creates substantive
liabilities that had no legal existence before the 1991 Act was passed,

$ 101 does not apply to preenactment conduct. Rather, Patterson
provides the authoritative interpretation of the phrase "make and enforce contracts" in $ 1981 before the 1991 amendment went into effect.
Pp. 309-314.

Opinion of the Court

I
Petitioners Rivers and Davison were employed by re-spondent Roadway Express, Inc., as garage mechanics. On

the morning of August 22, 1986, a supervisor directed themto attend disciplinary hearings later that day. Because they
had not received the proper notice guaranteed by theircollective-bargaining agreement, petitioners refused to attend. They were suspended for two days, but filed griev-ances and were awarded two days' backpay. Respondent
then held another disciplinary hearing, which petitioners alsorefused to attend, again on the ground that they had not
received proper notice. Respondent thereupon dischargedthem.

On December 22, 1986, petitioners filed a complaint alleg-ing that respondent had discharged them because of their
race in violation of 42 U. S. C. $ 1981.1 They claimed, interalia, that they had been fired on baseless charges because of
their race and because they had insisted on the same proce-dural protections afforded white employees.

On June 15, 1989, before the trial commenced, this Courtannounced its decision in

Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,491 U. S. 164. Patterson held that $ 1981 "does not apply to

conduct which occurs after the formation of a contract andwhich does not interfere with the right to enforce established contract obligations." Id., at 171. Relying on Pat-terson, the District Court held that none of petitioners' discriminatory discharge claims were covered by $ 1981, anddismissed their claims under that section. After a bench
trial on petitioners' Title VII claims, the District Courtfound that petitioners had been discharged for reasons other
than their race, and entered judgment for respondent.

1 Petitioners' amended complaint also alleged claims against respondent
under the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Stat. 157, as
amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 185(a), and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e et seq., as well as claims
against their union. Those claims are not before us.

302 RIVERS v. ROADWAY EXPRESS, INC.

Opinion of the Court
On appeal, petitioners contended that the District Court
had misconstrued their complaint: They had not merely
claimed discriminatory discharge, but more specifically had
alleged that respondent had retaliated against them, because
of their race, for attempting to enforce their procedural
rights under the collective-bargaining agreement. Because
that allegation related to "enforcement" of the labor contract,
petitioners maintained, it stated a $ 1981 claim even under
Patterson's construction of the statute. While petitioners'
appeal was pending, the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (1991 Act
or Act) became law. Section 101 of that Act provides that

$ 1981's prohibition against racial discrimination in the making and enforcement of contracts applies to all phases and
incidents of the contractual relationship, including discriminatory contract terminations.2 Petitioners accordingly filed

2 The full text of $ 101, which is entitled "Prohibition Against All Racial
Discrimination in the Making And Enforcement of Contracts," reads as
follows:

"Section 1977 of the Revised Statutes (42 U. S. C. 1981) is amended--
"(1) by inserting `(a)' before `All persons within'; and
"(2) by adding at the end the following new subsections:
"(b) For purposes of this section, the term `make and enforce contracts'
includes the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions
of the contractual relationship.

"(c) The rights protected by this section are protected against impairment by nongovernmental discrimination and impairment under color of
State law."

Prior to the 1991 amendment, $ 1981 provided:

"All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the
same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to
sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws
and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by
white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties,
taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other."

The history of $ 1981, which is sometimes cited as $ 1977 of the Revised
Statutes, is set forth in Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 168-170, and
n. 8 (1976).

Opinion of the Court
a supplemental brief advancing the argument that the newstatute applied in their case. The Court of Appeals agreed

with petitioners' first contention but not the second. Ac-cordingly, it ruled that $ 1981 as interpreted in Patterson,
not as amended by $ 101, governed the case and remandedfor a jury trial limited to petitioners' discrimination-incontract-enforcement claim. See Harvis v. Roadway Express, Inc., 973 F. 2d 490 (CA6 1992).We granted certiorari, 507 U. S. 908 (1993), on the sole

question whether $ 101 of the 1991 Act applies to cases pend-ing when it was enacted and set the case for argument with
Landgraf v. USI Film Products, ante, p. 244.

II
In Landgraf, we concluded that $ 102 of the 1991 Act doesnot apply to cases that arose before its enactment. The reasons supporting that conclusion also apply to $ 101, and re-quire rejection of two of petitioners' submissions in this case.
First, these petitioners, like the petitioner in Landgraf,rely heavily on a negative implication argument based on

$$ 402(a), 109(c), and 402(b) of the Act. That argument, how-ever, is no more persuasive as to the application of $ 101 to
preenactment conduct than as to that of $ 102. See ante,at 257-263.

Second, petitioners argue that the case is governed by
Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U. S. 696 (1974),rather than the presumption against statutory retroactivity.

We are persuaded, however, that the presumption is evenmore clearly applicable to $ 101 than to $ 102. Section 102
altered the liabilities of employers under Title VII by sub-jecting them to expanded monetary liability, but it did not
alter the normative scope of Title VII's prohibition on work-place discrimination. In contrast, because $ 101 amended

$ 1981 to embrace all aspects of the contractual relationship,including contract terminations, it enlarged the category of
conduct that is subject to $ 1981 liability.

304 RIVERS v. ROADWAY EXPRESS, INC.

Opinion of the Court
Moreover, $ 1981 (and hence $ 101) is not limited to employ-ment; because it covers all contracts, see, e. g., Runyon v.

McCrary, 427 U. S. 160 (1976), Tillman v. Wheaton-HavenRecreation Assn., Inc., 410 U. S. 431 (1973), a substantial
part of $ 101's sweep does not overlap Title VII. In short,$ 101 has the effect not only of increasing liability but also of
establishing a new standard of conduct.3 Accordingly, forreasons we stated in

Landgraf, the important new legal obli-gations $ 101 imposes bring it within the class of laws that

are presumptively prospective.

III
Petitioners rely heavily on an argument that was not ap-plicable to $ 102 of the 1991 Act, the section at issue in

Land-graf. They contend that $ 101 should apply to their case because it was "restorative" of the understanding of $ 1981 thatprevailed before our decision in

Patterson. Petitioners ad-vance two variations on this theme: Congress' evident purpose to "restore" pre-Patterson law indicates that it affirm-atively intended $ 101 to apply to cases arising before its
enactment; 4 moreover, there is a "presumption in favor ofapplication of restorative statutes" to cases arising before
their enactment. Brief for Petitioners 37.

A
Congress' decision to alter the rule of law established inone of our cases--as petitioners put it, to "legislatively overrul[e]," see id., at 38--does not, by itself, reveal whetherCongress intends the "overruling" statute to apply retroac3 Even in the employment context, $ 1981's coverage is broader than
Title VII's, for Title VII applies only to employers with 15 or more employees, see 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e(b), whereas $ 1981 has no such limitation.

4 See Brief for Petitioners 35 ("Congress sought to restore what it and

virtually all the lower courts thought had been the reach of $ 1981 prior
to Patterson").

Opinion of the Court
tively to events that would otherwise be governed by the
judicial decision.5 A legislative response does not necessarily indicate that Congress viewed the judicial decision as
"wrongly decided" as an interpretive matter. Congress may
view the judicial decision as an entirely correct reading of
prior law--or it may be altogether indifferent to the decision's technical merits--but may nevertheless decide that
the old law should be amended, but only for the future.
Of course, Congress may also decide to announce a new
rule that operates retroactively to govern the rights of parties whose rights would otherwise be subject to the rule
announced in the judicial decision. Because retroactivity
raises special policy concerns, the choice to enact a statute
that responds to a judicial decision is quite distinct from the
choice to make the responding statute retroactive.

Petitioners argue that the structure and legislative history
of $ 101 indicate that Congress specifically intended to "restore" prior law even as to parties whose rights would otherwise have been determined according to Patterson's interpretation of $ 1981. Thus, $ 101 operates as a gloss on the
terms "make and enforce contracts," the original language
of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 that was before this Court in
Patterson. Petitioners also point to evidence in the 1991
Act's legislative history indicating legislators' distress with
Patterson's construction of $ 1981 and their view that our
decision had narrowed a previously established understand5 Congress frequently "responds" to judicial decisions construing statutes, and does so for a variety of reasons. According to one commentator,
between 1967 and 1990, the Legislature "overrode" our decisions at an
average of "ten per Congress." Eskridge, Overriding Supreme Court
Statutory Interpretation Decisions, 101 Yale L. J. 331, 338 (1991). Seldom
if ever has Congress responded to so many decisions in a single piece of
legislation as it did in the Civil Rights Act of 1991. See Landgraf v. USI

ing of that provision.6 Taken together, petitioners argue,this evidence shows that it was Congress' sense that

Patterson had cut back the proper scope of $ 1981, and that the new
legislation would restore its proper scope. Regardless of
whether that sense was right or wrong as a technical legal
matter, petitioners maintain, we should give it effect by
applying $ 101's broader definition of what it means to "make
and enforce" a contract, rather than Patterson's congressionally disapproved reading, to cases pending upon $ 101's
enactment.

We may assume, as petitioners argue, that $ 101 reflects
congressional disapproval of Patterson's interpretation of

6 Thus, for example, the Senate Report on the 1990 civil rights bill that
was passed by Congress but vetoed by the President stated:

"The Patterson decision sharply cut back on the scope and effectiveness
of section 1981, with profoundly negative consequences both in the employment context and elsewhere. As a result of the decision, the more
than 11 million employees in firms that are not covered by Title VII lack
any protection against racial harassment and other forms of race discrimination on the job.. . . . .

"Since Patterson was announced, more than 200 claims of race discrimination have been dismissed by federal courts as a result of the decision.

Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. (March 9, 1990). Many persons subjected to blatant bigotry lack any means to obtain relief.. . . . .

"The Committee finds that there is a compelling need for legislation to
overrule the Patterson decision and ensure that federal law prohibits all
race discrimination in contracts." S. Rep. No. 101-315, pp. 12-14 (1990).

Congress' concern with the effects of the Patterson decision in specific
cases, including cases in which plaintiffs had won judgments only to have
them reversed after Patterson came down, see S. Rep. No. 315, at 13-14,
doubtless explains why the 1990 legislation contained a special provision
for the reopening of judgments. See Civil Rights Act of 1990, S. 2104,
101st Cong., 2d Sess., $ 15(b)(3) (1990); see also Landgraf, ante, at 255-256,
n. 8. Petitioners do not argue that the 1991 Act should be read to reach
cases finally decided.

$ 1981. We may even assume that many or even most legis-lators believed that Patterson was not only incorrectly decided but also represented a departure from the previouslyprevailing understanding of the reach of $ 1981. Those assumptions would readily explain why Congress might have
wanted to legislate retroactively, thereby providing relief forthe persons it believed had been wrongfully denied a $ 1981

remedy. Even on those assumptions, however, we cannotfind in the 1991 Act any clear expression of congressional
intent to reach cases that arose before its enactment.The 1990 civil rights bill that was vetoed by the President
contained an amendment to $ 1981, identical to $ 101 of the1991 Act, that assuredly would have applied to pending
cases. See Civil Rights Act of 1990, S. 2104, 101st Cong.,
2d Sess., $ 12 (1990). See also Landgraf, ante, at 255-256,n. 8. In its statement of purposes, the bill unambiguously

declared that it was intended to "respond to the SupremeCourt's recent decisions by

restoring the civil rights protections that were dramatically limited by those decisions,"S. 2104, $ 2(b)(1) (emphasis added), and the section responding to Patterson was entitled "Restoring Prohibition AgainstAll Racial Discrimination in the Making and Enforcement of Contracts." Id., $ 12 (emphasis added).7 More di-rectly, $ 15(a)(6) of the 1990 bill expressly provided that the

7 We do not suggest that Congress' use of the word "restore" necessarily
bespeaks an intent to restore retroactively. For example, Congress
might, in response to a judicial decision that construed a criminal statute
narrowly, amend the legislation to broaden its scope; the preamble or legislative history of the amendment might state that it was intended to "restore" the statute to its originally intended scope. In such a situation,
there would be no need to read Congress' use of the word "restore" as an
attempt to circumvent the Ex Post Facto Clause. Instead, "to restore"
might sensibly be read as meaning "to correct, from now on." The 1990
bill did not suffer from such ambiguity, however, for it contained other
provisions that made pellucidly clear that Congress contemplated the
broader, retroactive kind of "restoration."

Opinion of the Court
amendment to $ 1981 "shall apply to all proceedings pendingon or commenced after" the date of the Patterson decision.

The statute that was actually enacted in 1991 contains nocomparable language. Instead of a reference to "restoring"
pre-existing rights, its statement of purposes describes theAct's function as "

expanding the scope of relevant civilrights statutes in order to provide adequate protection to

victims of discrimination." 1991 Act, $ 3(4), 105 Stat. 1071(emphasis added). Consistently with that revised statement
of purposes, the Act lacks any direct reference to cases aris-ing before its enactment, or to the date of the Patterson decision. Taken by itself, the fact that $ 101 is framed as a glosson $ 1981's original "make and enforce contracts" does not
demonstrate an intent to apply the new definition to pastacts. Altering statutory definitions, or adding new definitions of terms previously undefined, is a common way ofamending statutes, and simply does not answer the retroactivity question. Thus, the text of the Act does not supportthe argument that $ 101 of the 1991 Act was intended to
"restore" prior understandings of $ 1981 as to cases arisingbefore the 1991 Act's passage.

The legislative history of the 1991 Act does not bridge thegap in the text. The statements that most strongly support
such coverage are found in the debates on the 1990 bill. Seen. 6, supra. Such statements are of questionable relevance
to the 1991 Act, however, because the 1990 provision con-tained express retroactivity provisions that were omitted
from the 1991 legislation. The statements relating specifi-cally to $ 101 of the 1991 Act do not provide reliable evidence
on whether Congress intended to "restore" a broader mean-ing of $ 1981 with respect to pending cases otherwise governed by Patterson's construction of the scope of the phrase"make and enforce contracts."

8 Thus, the fact that $ 101

was enacted in response to Patterson does not supply suffi-cient evidence of a clear congressional intent to overcome

the presumption against statutory retroactivity.

B
A lack of clear congressional intent would not be disposi-tive if, as petitioners argue, $ 101 is the kind of restorative

statute that should presumptively be applied to pendingcases. Petitioners maintain that restorative statutes do not
implicate fairness concerns relating to retroactivity at leastwhen, as is the case in this litigation, the new statute simply
enacts a rule that the parties believed to be the law whenthey acted.

9 Indeed, amici in support of petitioners contend, fairness concerns positively favor application of $ 101to pending cases because the effect of the Patterson decision

of $ 1981. Compare, e. g., 137 Cong. Rec. H9526 (Nov. 7, 1991) (remarks
of Rep. Edwards), with id., at H9543 (Nov. 7, 1991) (remarks of Rep.
Hyde). The history also includes some debate over the proper test for
courts to apply--specifically, the "Bradley" presumption or the "Bowen"
presumption, see Landgraf, ante, at 263-265--to determine the applicability of the various provisions of the Act to pending cases. Compare, e. g.,
137 Cong. Rec. 30340 (1991) (remarks of Sen. Kennedy) (citing Bradley
test), with id., at 29043-29044 (remarks of Sen. Danforth) (favoring Bowen
test). As we noted in Landgraf, ante, at 262-263, the legislative history
reveals that retroactivity was recognized as an important and controversial issue, but that history falls far short of providing evidence of an agreement among legislators on the subject.

9 They point out that respondent has no persuasive claim to unfair

surprise, because, at the time the allegedly discriminatory discharge occurred, the Sixth Circuit precedent held that $ 1981 could support a claim
for discriminatory contract termination. See, e. g., Cooper v. North Olmstead, 795 F. 2d 1265, 1270, n. 3 (1986); Leonard v. City of Frankfort Elec.
and Water Plant Bd., 752 F. 2d 189, 195 (1985). See also Mozee v. American Commercial Marine Service Co., 963 F. 2d 929, 941 (CA7 1992) (Cudahy, J., dissenting); Gersman v. Group Health Assn., Inc., 975 F. 2d 886,
907-908 (CADC 1992) (Wald, J., dissenting), cert. pending, No. 92-1190.
We note, however, that this argument would not apply to any cases arising
after Patterson was decided but before the 1991 Act's enactment.

Opinion of the Court
was to cut off, after the fact, rights of action under $ 1981
that had been widely recognized in the lower courts, and
under which many victims of discrimination had won damages judgments prior to Patterson. See Brief for NAACP
et al. as Amici Curiae 7-14.

Notwithstanding the equitable appeal of petitioners' argument, we are convinced that it cannot carry the day. Our
decisions simply do not support the proposition that we have
espoused a "presumption" in favor of retroactive application
of restorative statutes. Petitioners invoke Frisbie v. Whitney, 9 Wall. 187 (1870), which involved a federal statute that
enabled Frisbie and others to acquire property they had occupied and thought they owned prior to 1862, when, in another case, this Court held that the original grant of title by
the Mexican Government was void.10 The new law in effect
"restored" rights that Frisbie reasonably and in good faith
thought he possessed before the surprising announcement of
our decision. In the Frisbie case, however, the question
was whether Congress had the power to enact legislation
that had the practical effect of restoring the status quo
retroactively. As the following passage from Frisbie
demonstrates, there was no question about Congress' actual intent:

"We say the benefits it designed to confer, because we
entertain no doubt of the intention of Congress to secure to persons situated as Frisbie was, the title to their
lands, on compliance with the terms of the act, and if
this has not been done it is solely because Congress

10 See United States v. Vallejo, 1 Black 541 (1862). In his dissent in that
case, Justice Grier stated that he could not "agree to confiscate the property of some thousand of our fellow-citizens, who have purchased under
this title and made improvements to the value of many millions, on suspicions first raised here as to the integrity of a grant universally acknowledged to be genuine in the country where it originated." Id., at 555-556

had no power to enact the law in question." Id., at 192(emphasis in original).

Petitioners also point to Freeborn v. Smith, 2 Wall. 160(1865). There, a statute admitting Nevada to the Union had
failed to provide for jurisdiction over cases arising from Ne-vada Territory that were pending before this Court when
Nevada achieved statehood. We upheld against constitu-tional attack a subsequent statute explicitly curing the "accidental impediment" to our jurisdiction over such cases. See
id., at 173-175.In the case before us today, however, we do not question

the power of Congress to apply its definition of the term"make and enforce contracts" to cases arising before the 1991
Act became effective, or, indeed, to those that were pendingon June 15, 1989, when Patterson was decided. The question is whether Congress has manifested such an intent.Unlike the narrow error-correcting statutes at issue in

Fris-bie and Freeborn, $ 101 is plainly not the sort of provision

that must be read to apply to pending cases "because a con-trary reading would render it ineffective." Landgraf, ante,
at 286. Section 101 is readily comprehensible, and entirelyeffective, even if it applies only to conduct occurring after
its effective date. A restorative purpose may be relevant towhether Congress specifically intended a new statute to govern past conduct, but we do not "presume" an intent to actretroactively in such cases.

11 We still require clear evidence

of intent to impose the restorative statute "retroactively."Section 101, and the statute of which it is a part, does not

contain such evidence."The principle that statutes operate only prospectively,
while judicial decisions operate retrospectively, is familiar to

11 See N. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction $ 27.04, p. 472
(5th ed. 1993) ("The usual purpose of a special interpretive statute is to
correct a judicial interpretation of a prior law which the legislature considers inaccurate. Where such statutes are given any effect, the effect is

every law student," United States v. Security Industrial
Bank, 459 U. S. 70, 79 (1982), and this case illustrates the
second half of that principle as well as the first. Even
though applicable Sixth Circuit precedents were otherwise
when this dispute arose, the District Court properly applied
Patterson to this case. See Harper v. Virginia Dept. of
Taxation, 509 U. S. 86, 97 (1993) ("When this Court applies
a rule of federal law to the parties before it, that rule is the
controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given
full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review
and as to all events, regardless of whether such events predate or postdate our announcement of the rule"). See also
Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., 215 U. S. 349, 372 (1910) ("Judicial decisions have had retrospective operation for near a
thousand years") (Holmes, J., dissenting). The essence of
judicial decisionmaking--applying general rules to particular situations--necessarily involves some peril to individual
expectations because it is often difficult to predict the precise application of a general rule until it has been distilled in
the crucible of litigation. See L. Fuller, Morality of Law
56 (1964) ("No system of law--whether it be judge-made or
legislatively enacted--can be so perfectly drafted as to leave
no room for dispute").

Patterson did not overrule any prior decision of this
Court; rather, it held and therefore established that the prior
decisions of the Courts of Appeals which read $ 1981 to cover
discriminatory contract termination were incorrect. They
were not wrong according to some abstract standard of interpretive validity, but by the rules that necessarily govern our
hierarchical federal court system. Cf. Brown v. Allen, 344
U. S. 443, 540 (1953) (Jackson, J., concurring in result). It is
this Court's responsibility to say what a statute means, and
once the Court has spoken, it is the duty of other courts to
respect that understanding of the governing rule of law. A
judicial construction of a statute is an authoritative state511us1$41I 11-08-97 19:58:21 PAGES OPINPGT

313Cite as: 511 U. S. 298 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
ment of what the statute meant before as well as after thedecision of the case giving rise to that construction.

12 Thus,

Patterson provides the authoritative interpretation of thephrase "make and enforce contracts" in the Civil Rights Act

of 1866 before the 1991 amendment went into effect on November 21, 1991. That interpretation provides the baseline
for our conclusion that the 1991 amendment would be "retroactive" if applied to cases arising before that date.

Congress, of course, has the power to amend a statute that
it believes we have misconstrued. It may even, within
broad constitutional bounds, make such a change retroactive
and thereby undo what it perceives to be the undesirable
past consequences of a misinterpretation of its work product.
No such change, however, has the force of law unless it
is implemented through legislation. Even when Congress
intends to supersede a rule of law embodied in one of our
decisions with what it views as a better rule established in
earlier decisions, its intent to reach conduct preceding the
"corrective" amendment must clearly appear. We cannot
say that such an intent clearly appears with respect to $ 101.
For this reason, and because it creates liabilities that had no
legal existence before the Act was passed, $ 101 does not
apply to preenactment conduct.

12 When Congress enacts a new statute, it has the power to decide when
the statute will become effective. The new statute may govern from the
date of enactment, from a specified future date, or even from an expressly
announced earlier date. But when this Court construes a statute, it is
explaining its understanding of what the statute has meant continuously
since the date when it became law. In statutory cases the Court has no
authority to depart from the congressional command setting the effective
date of a law that it has enacted. Thus, it is not accurate to say that the
Court's decision in Patterson "changed" the law that previously prevailed
in the Sixth Circuit when this case was filed. Rather, given the structure
of our judicial system, the Patterson opinion finally decided what $ 1981
had always meant and explained why the Courts of Appeals had misinterpreted the will of the enacting Congress.

Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is af-firmed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings

[For opinion of Justice Scalia concurring in the judg-ment, see ante, p. 286.]
Justice Blackmun, dissenting.
For the reasons stated in my dissent in Landgraf v. USIFilm Products, ante, p. 294, I also dissent in this case.

Here, just as in Landgraf, the most natural reading of theCivil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat. 1071, and this Court's
precedents is that $ 101 applies to cases pending on appealon the statute's enactment date, at least where application of
the new provision would not disturb the parties' vestedrights or settled expectations. This is such a case.

In 1986, when respondent Roadway Express, Inc., discharged petitioners Maurice Rivers and Robert C. Davison
from their jobs as garage mechanics, 42 U. S. C. $ 1981, whichgives all persons the same right to "make and enforce contracts," 1 was widely understood to apply to the discrimina-tory enforcement and termination of employment contracts.
See Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421 U. S. 454,
459-460 (1975) ("Although this Court has not specifically so
held, it is well settled among the Federal Courts of Ap-peals--and we now join them--that $ 1981 affords a federal

remedy against discrimination in private employment on thebasis of race"). This understanding comports with $ 101 of
the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat. 1072, providing that"the term `make and enforce contracts' includes the making,
performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and

1 Until the 1991 amendment, $ 1981 stated: "All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State
and Territory to make and enforce contracts . . . as is enjoyed by white
citizens . . . ."

the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and condi-tions of the contractual relationship." The majority seemingly accepts petitioners' argument that if this Court wereto apply $ 101 to their case, "respondent has no persuasive
claim to unfair surprise, because, at the time the allegedly
discriminatory discharge occurred, the Sixth Circuit prece-dent held that $ 1981 could support a claim for discriminatory

contract termination." Ante, at 309, n. 9.Nonetheless, applying a new, supercharged version of our
traditional presumption against retroactive legislation, theCourt concludes that petitioners, whose claim was pending
when this Court announced Patterson v. McLean Credit
Union, 491 U. S. 164 (1989), are bound by that decision,
which limited $ 1981 to contract formation. Patterson's
tenure was--or surely should have been--brief, as $ 101 was
intended to overrule Patterson and to deny it further effect.
The Court's holding today, however, prolongs the life of that
congressionally repudiated decision. See Estate of Reynolds v. Martin, 985 F. 2d 470, 475-476 (CA9 1993) (denying
application of $ 101 to cases pending at its enactment would
allow repudiated decisions, including Patterson, to "live on
in the federal courts for . . . years").

Although the Court's opinions in this case and in Landgraf
do bring needed clarity to our retroactivity jurisprudence,
they do so only at the expense of stalling the intended application of remedial and restorative legislation. In its effort
to reconcile the "apparent tension," Kaiser Aluminum &
Chemical Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U. S. 827, 837 (1990), between Bradley v. School Bd. of Richmond, 416 U. S. 696
(1974), and Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hospital, 488 U. S.
204 (1988), the Court loses sight of the core purpose of its
retroactivity doctrine, namely, to respect and effectuate new
laws to the extent consistent with congressional intent and
with the vested rights and settled expectations of the parties. In Bradley, a unanimous Court applied an intervening statute allowing reasonable attorney's fees for school511us1$41F 11-08-97 19:58:21 PAGES OPINPGT
316 RIVERS v. ROADWAY EXPRESS, INC.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
desegregation plaintiffs to a case pending on appeal on thestatute's effective date. The Court observed that the statute merely created an "additional basis or source for theBoard's potential obligation to pay attorneys' fees." 416
U. S., at 721.2 Just as the school board in Bradley was onnotice that it could be liable for attorney's fees, the employer
in this case was on notice--from the prevailing interpretation of $ 1981--that it could be liable for damages for a ra-cially discriminatory contract termination. Indeed, in this

case, the employer's original liability stemmed from the veryprovision that petitioners now seek to enforce.

In Bowen, by contrast, the Court unanimously interpretedauthorizing statutes not to permit the Secretary of Health
and Human Services retroactively to change the rules forcalculating hospitals' reimbursements for past services provided under Medicare. Although Bowen properly turned on
the textual analysis of the applicable statutes, neither citing
Bradley nor resorting to presumptions on retroactivity, its
broad dicta disfavored the retroactive application of congressional enactments and administrative rules. See 488 U. S.,
at 208. Bowen is consistent, however, with the Court's analysis in Bennett v. New Jersey, 470 U. S. 632 (1985), appraising
the "[p]ractical considerations," id., at 640, that counsel
against retroactive changes in federal grant programs and
noting that such changes would deprive recipients of "fixed,
predictable standards." Ibid. Bowen also accords with
Bradley's concern for preventing the injustice that would result from the disturbance of the parties' reasonable reliance.
Thus, properly understood, Bradley establishes a presump2 Here, of course, $ 101 creates a basis or source--in addition to Title
VII--for the prohibition on racial discrimination in the enforcement of
employment contracts. Title VII makes it illegal for an employer "to fail
or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color,
religion, sex, or national origin." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1).

tion that new laws apply to pending cases in the absenceof manifest injustice, and Bowen and Bennett stand for the

corresponding presumption against applying new laws whendoing so would cause the very injustice Bradley is designed
to avoid.3Applying these principles here, "[w]hen a law purports to
restore the status quo in existence prior to an interveningSupreme Court decision, the application of that law to conduct occurring prior to the decision would obviously not frus-trate the expectations of the parties concerning the legal
consequences of their actions at that time." Gersman v.
Group Health Assn., Inc., 975 F. 2d 886, 907 (CADC 1992)(dissenting opinion). While $ 101 undoubtedly expands the

scope of $ 1981 to prohibit conduct that was not illegal under
Patterson,4 in the present context $ 101 provides a remedyfor conduct that was recognized as illegal when it occurred,

both under $ 1981 and under Title VII. Thus, as far as re-spondent is concerned, the law in effect when it dismissed
petitioners' claim differs little from the law as amended bythe Civil Rights Act of 1991, and application of $ 101 in this
case would neither alter the expectations of the parties nordisturb previously vested rights. Because I believe that the
most faithful reading of our precedents makes this the appro-priate inquiry, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of
Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings.

3 An inquiry into the vested rights and settled expectations of the parties is fairer and more sensitive than a mechanical reliance on a substance/
procedure dichotomy. See Gersman v. Group Health Assn., Inc., 975
F. 2d 886, 906 (CADC 1992) (Wald, J., dissenting); Mozee v. American
Commercial Marine Service Co., 963 F. 2d 929, 940-941 (CA7 1992) (Cudahy, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing).

4 Not all conduct proscribed by $ 101 was also unlawful under Title VII

or other civil rights laws. For example, $ 101, unlike Title VII, see 42
U. S. C. $ 2000e(b), applies to small employers, and even outside the employment context, see, e. g., Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160 (1976).

Syllabus

STANSBURY v. CALIFORNIA
certiorari to the supreme court of california

No. 93-5770. Argued March 30, 1994--Decided April 26, 1994
When California police first questioned petitioner Stansbury as a possible

witness to the rape and murder of a 10-year-old girl, they had another
suspect. However, Stansbury became a suspect during the interview,
when he told police that, on the night of the murder, he drove a car
matching the one seen where the girl's body was found. After he also
admitted to prior convictions for rape, kidnaping, and child molestation,
officers stopped the interview, advised him of his rights under Miranda
v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, and arrested him. The trial court denied his
pretrial motion to suppress his statements to the police, reasoning that
he was not "in custody" for purposes of Miranda until the officers began
to suspect him. He was convicted of, inter alia, first-degree murder
and sentenced to death. In affirming, the State Supreme Court concluded that one of the relevant factors in determining whether Stansbury was in custody was whether the investigation was focused on him.
Agreeing that suspicion focused on him only when he mentioned the car,
the court found that Miranda did not bar the admission of statements
made before that point.

Held: Because the initial determination of custody depends on the objective circumstances of the interrogation, an officer's subjective and undisclosed view concerning whether the interrogee is a suspect is irrelevant
to the assessment whether that person is in custody. See, e. g., Beckwith v. United States, 425 U. S. 341. Numerous statements in the State
Supreme Court's opinion are open to the interpretation that the court
regarded the officers' subjective beliefs regarding Stansbury's status as
a suspect as significant in and of themselves, rather than as relevant
only to the extent they influenced the objective conditions surrounding
his interrogation. The State Supreme Court should consider in the first
instance whether objective circumstances show that Stansbury was in
custody during the entire interrogation.

This case concerns the rules for determining whether aperson being questioned by law enforcement officers is held

in custody, and thus entitled to the warnings required by
Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). We hold, not forthe first time, that an officer's subjective and undisclosed

view concerning whether the person being interrogated is asuspect is irrelevant to the assessment whether the person

Ten-year-old Robyn Jackson disappeared from a play-ground in Baldwin Park, California, at around 6:30 p.m. on
September 28, 1982. Early the next morning, about 10miles away in Pasadena, Andrew Zimmerman observed a
large man emerge from a turquoise American sedan andthrow something into a nearby flood control channel. Zimmerman called the police, who arrived at the scene and dis-covered the girl's body in the channel. There was evidence
that she had been raped, and the cause of death was deter-mined to be asphyxia complicated by blunt force trauma to
the head.Lieutenant Thomas Johnston, a detective with the Los

icide. From witnesses interviewed on the day the body wasdiscovered, he learned that Robyn had talked to two ice

cream truck drivers, one being petitioner Robert EdwardStansbury, in the hours before her disappearance. Given
these contacts, Johnston thought Stansbury and the other
driver might have some connection with the homicide orknowledge thereof, but for reasons unimportant here Johnston considered only the other driver to be a leading suspect.After the suspect driver was brought in for interrogation,
Johnston asked Officer Lee of the Baldwin Park Police De-partment to contact Stansbury to see if he would come in for
questioning as a potential witness.

Lee and three other plainclothes officers arrived at Stansbury's trailer home at about 11:00 that evening. The officers
surrounded the door and Lee knocked. When Stansbury answered, Lee told him the officers were investigating a homicide to which Stansbury was a possible witness and asked if
he would accompany them to the police station to answer
some questions. Stansbury agreed to the interview and accepted a ride to the station in the front seat of Lee's police
car.

At the station, Lieutenant Johnston, in the presence of
another officer, questioned Stansbury about his whereabouts
and activities during the afternoon and evening of September 28. Neither Johnston nor the other officer issued Miranda warnings. Stansbury told the officers (among other
things) that on the evening of the 28th he spoke with the
victim at about 6:00, returned to his trailer home after work
at 9:00, and left the trailer at about midnight in his housemate's turquoise, American-made car. This last detail
aroused Johnston's suspicions, as the turquoise car matched
the description of the one Andrew Zimmerman had observed
in Pasadena. When Stansbury, in response to a further
question, admitted to prior convictions for rape, kidnaping,
and child molestation, Johnston terminated the interview
and another officer advised Stansbury of his Miranda rights.

Stansbury declined to make further statements, requested
an attorney, and was arrested. Respondent State of California charged Stansbury with first-degree murder and other
crimes.

Stansbury filed a pretrial motion to suppress all statements made at the station, and the evidence discovered as a
result of those statements. The trial court denied the motion in relevant part, ruling that Stansbury was not "in custody"--and thus not entitled to Miranda warnings--until he
mentioned that he had taken his housemate's turquoise car
for a midnight drive. Before that stage of the interview,
the trial court reasoned, "the focus in [Lieutenant Johnston's]
mind certainly was on the other ice cream [truck] driver,"
Tr. 2368; only "after Mr. Stansbury made the comment . . .
describing the . . . turquoise-colored automobile" did Johnston's suspicions "shif[t] to Mr. Stansbury," ibid. Based
upon its conclusion that Stansbury was not in custody until
Johnston's suspicions had focused on him, the trial court
permitted the prosecution to introduce in its case in chief
the statements Stansbury made before that time. At trial,
the jury convicted Stansbury of first-degree murder, rape,
kidnaping, and lewd act on a child under the age of 14, and
fixed the penalty for the first-degree murder at death.

The California Supreme Court affirmed. Before determining whether Stansbury was in custody during the interview at the station, the court set out what it viewed as the
applicable legal standard:

"In deciding the custody issue, the totality of the circumstances is relevant, and no one factor is dispositive. However, the most important considerations include (1) the
site of the interrogation, (2) whether the investigation
has focused on the subject, (3) whether the objective indicia of arrest are present, and (4) the length and form
of questioning." 4 Cal. 4th 1017, 1050, 846 P. 2d 756,
775 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Per Curiam
The court proceeded to analyze the second factor in detail,
in the end accepting the trial court's factual determination
"that suspicion focused on [Stansbury] only when he mentioned that he had driven a turquoise car on the night of the
crime." Id., at 1052, 846 P. 2d, at 776. The court "conclude[d] that [Stansbury] was not subject to custodial interrogation before he mentioned the turquoise car," and thus
approved the trial court's ruling that Miranda v. Arizona
did not bar the admission of statements Stansbury made before that point. 4 Cal. 4th, at 1054, 846 P. 2d, at 777-778.

We granted certiorari. 510 U. S. 943 (1993).

II
We held in Miranda that a person questioned by law enforcement officers after being "taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way"
must first "be warned that he has a right to remain silent,
that any statement he does make may be used as evidence
against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an
attorney, either retained or appointed." 384 U. S., at 444.
Statements elicited in noncompliance with this rule may not
be admitted for certain purposes in a criminal trial. Compare id., at 492, 494, with Harris v. New York, 401 U. S. 222
(1971). An officer's obligation to administer Miranda warnings attaches, however, "only where there has been such
a restriction on a person's freedom as to render him `in
custody.' " Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U. S. 492, 495 (1977)
(per curiam); see also Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U. S. 292,
296 (1990). In determining whether an individual was in
custody, a court must examine all of the circumstances
surrounding the interrogation, but "the ultimate inquiry is
simply whether there [was] a `formal arrest or restraint on
freedom of movement' of the degree associated with a formal
arrest." California v. Beheler, 463 U. S. 1121, 1125 (1983)
(per curiam) (quoting Mathiason, supra, at 495).

Our decisions make clear that the initial determination ofcustody depends on the objective circumstances of the interrogation, not on the subjective views harbored by either theinterrogating officers or the person being questioned. In
Beckwith v. United States, 425 U. S. 341 (1976), for example,
the defendant, without being advised of his Miranda rights,made incriminating statements to Government agents during an interview in a private home. He later asked that
Miranda "be extended to cover interrogation in noncustodial circumstances after a police investigation has fo-cused on the suspect." 425 U. S., at 345 (internal quotation

marks omitted). We found his argument unpersuasive, explaining that it "was the compulsive aspect of custodial interrogation, and not the strength or content of the government's
suspicions at the time the questioning was conducted, which
led the Court to impose the Miranda requirements with
regard to custodial questioning." Id., at 346-347 (internal
quotation marks omitted). As a result, we concluded that
the defendant was not entitled to Miranda warnings: "Although the `focus' of an investigation may indeed have been
on Beckwith at the time of the interview . . . , he hardly
found himself in the custodial situation described by the Miranda Court as the basis for its holding." 425 U. S., at 347.

Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420 (1984), reaffirmed the
conclusions reached in Beckwith. Berkemer concerned the
roadside questioning of a motorist detained in a traffic stop.
We decided that the motorist was not in custody for purposes
of Miranda even though the traffic officer "apparently decided as soon as [the motorist] stepped out of his car that
[the motorist] would be taken into custody and charged with
a traffic offense." 468 U. S., at 442. The reason, we explained, was that the officer "never communicated his intention to" the motorist during the relevant questioning. Ibid.
The lack of communication was crucial, for under Miranda
"[a] policeman's unarticulated plan has no bearing on the
question whether a suspect was `in custody' at a particular

Per Curiam
time"; rather, "the only relevant inquiry is how a reasonable
man in the suspect's position would have understood his situation." 468 U. S., at 442. Other cases of ours have been
consistent in adhering to this understanding of the custody
element of Miranda. See, e. g., Mathiason, supra, at 495
("Nor is the requirement of warnings to be imposed simply
because . . . the questioned person is one whom the police
suspect. Miranda warnings are required only where there
has been such a restriction on a person's freedom as to render him `in custody' "); Beheler, supra, at 1124, n. 2 ("Our
holding in Mathiason reflected our earlier decision in [Beckwith], in which we rejected the notion that the `in custody'
requirement was satisfied merely because the police interviewed a person who was the `focus' of a criminal investigation"); Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U. S. 420, 431 (1984) ("The
mere fact that an investigation has focused on a suspect does
not trigger the need for Miranda warnings in noncustodial
settings, and the probation officer's knowledge and intent
have no bearing on the outcome of this case") (citation omitted); cf. Pennsylvania v. Bruder, 488 U. S. 9, 11, n. 2 (1988).

It is well settled, then, that a police officer's subjective
view that the individual under questioning is a suspect, if
undisclosed, does not bear upon the question whether the
individual is in custody for purposes of Miranda. See F.
Inbau, J. Reid, & J. Buckley, Criminal Interrogation and Confessions 232, 236, 297-298 (3d ed. 1986). The same principle
obtains if an officer's undisclosed assessment is that the person being questioned is not a suspect. In either instance,
one cannot expect the person under interrogation to probe
the officer's innermost thoughts. Save as they are communicated or otherwise manifested to the person being questioned, an officer's evolving but unarticulated suspicions do
not affect the objective circumstances of an interrogation or
interview, and thus cannot affect the Miranda custody inquiry. "The threat to a citizen's Fifth Amendment rights

Per Curiam
that Miranda was designed to neutralize has little to do with
the strength of an interrogating officer's suspicions." Berkemer, supra, at 435, n. 22.

An officer's knowledge or beliefs may bear upon the custody issue if they are conveyed, by word or deed, to the individual being questioned. Cf. Michigan v. Chesternut, 486
U. S. 567, 575, n. 7 (1988) (citing United States v. Mendenhall,
446 U. S. 544, 554, n. 6 (1980) (opinion of Stewart, J.)). Those
beliefs are relevant only to the extent they would affect how
a reasonable person in the position of the individual being
questioned would gauge the breadth of his or her " `freedom
of action.' " Berkemer, supra, at 440. Even a clear statement from an officer that the person under interrogation is
a prime suspect is not, in itself, dispositive of the custody
issue, for some suspects are free to come and go until the
police decide to make an arrest. The weight and pertinence
of any communications regarding the officer's degree of suspicion will depend upon the facts and circumstances of the
particular case. In sum, an officer's views concerning the
nature of an interrogation, or beliefs concerning the potential
culpability of the individual being questioned, may be one
among many factors that bear upon the assessment whether
that individual was in custody, but only if the officer's views
or beliefs were somehow manifested to the individual under
interrogation and would have affected how a reasonable person in that position would perceive his or her freedom to
leave. (Of course, instances may arise in which the officer's
undisclosed views are relevant in testing the credibility of
his or her account of what happened during an interrogation;
but it is the objective surroundings, and not any undisclosed
views, that control the Miranda custody inquiry.)

We decide on this state of the record that the California
Supreme Court's analysis of whether Stansbury was in custody is not consistent in all respects with the foregoing principles. Numerous statements in the court's opinion are open

to the interpretation that the court regarded the officers'
subjective beliefs regarding Stansbury's status as a suspect
(or nonsuspect) as significant in and of themselves, rather
than as relevant only to the extent they influenced the objective conditions surrounding his interrogation. See 4 Cal.
4th, at 1050, 846 P. 2d, at 775 ("whether the investigation
ha[d] focused on the" person being questioned is among the
"most important considerations" in assessing whether the
person was in custody). So understood, the court's analysis
conflicts with our precedents. The court's apparent conclusion that Stansbury's Miranda rights were triggered by virtue of the fact that he had become the focus of the officers'
suspicions, see 4 Cal. 4th, at 1052, 1054, 846 P. 2d, at 776,
777-778; cf., e. g., State v. Blanding, 69 Haw. 583, 586-587,
752 P. 2d 99, 101 (1988); State v. Hartman, 703 S. W. 2d 106,

v. Herdon, 42 Cal. App. 3d 300, 307, n. 10, 116 Cal. Rptr. 641,
645, n. 10 (1974), is incorrect as well. Our cases make clear,
in no uncertain terms, that any inquiry into whether the interrogating officers have focused their suspicions upon the
individual being questioned (assuming those suspicions remain undisclosed) is not relevant for purposes of Miranda.
See generally 1 W. LaFave & J. Israel, Criminal Procedure

$6.6(a), pp. 489-490 (1984).

The State acknowledges that Lieutenant Johnston's and
the other officers' subjective and undisclosed suspicions (or
lack thereof) do not bear upon the question whether Stansbury was in custody, for purposes of Miranda, during the
station house interview. It main. tains, however, that the objective facts in the record support a finding that Stansbury
was not in custody until his arrest. Stansbury, by contrast,
asserts that the objective circumstances show that he was in
custody during the entire interrogation. We think it appropriate for the California Supreme Court to consider this
question in the first instance. We therefore reverse its

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 92-1639. Argued January 19, 1994--Decided May 2, 1994
Respondent Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) sued petitioners, the

city of Chicago and its mayor, alleging that they were violating the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) and implementing regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by
using landfills not licensed to accept hazardous wastes as disposal sites
for the toxic municipal waste combustion (MWC) ash that is left as a
residue when the city's resource recovery incinerator burns household
waste and nonhazardous industrial waste to produce energy. Although
it was uncontested that, with respect to the ash, petitioners had not
adhered to any of the RCRA Subtitle C requirements addressing hazardous wastes, the District Court granted them summary judgment on
the ground that $ 3001(i) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, a provision
within RCRA, excluded the ash from those requirements. The Court
of Appeals disagreed and reversed, but, while certiorari was pending
in this Court, the EPA issued a memorandum directing its personnel,
in accordance with the agency's view of $ 3001(i), to treat MWC ash as
exempt from Subtitle C regulation. On remand following this Court's
vacation of the judgment, the Court of Appeals reinstated its previous
opinion, holding that, because the statute's plain language is dispositive,
the EPA memorandum did not affect its analysis.

Held: Section 3001(i) does not exempt the MWC ash generated by petitioners' facility from Subtitle C regulation as hazardous waste. Although a pre-$ 3001(i) EPA regulation provided a "waste stream" exemption covering household waste from generation through treatment
to final disposal of residues, petitioners' facility would not have come
within that exemption because it burned something in addition to household waste; the facility would have been considered a Subtitle C hazardous waste generator, but not a (more stringently regulated) Subtitle C hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facility, since
all the waste it took in was nonhazardous. Section 3001(i) cannot be
interpreted as extending the pre-existing waste-stream exemption to
the product of a combined household/nonhazardous-industrial treatment
facility such as petitioners'. Although the section is entitled "Clarification of household waste exclusion," its plain language--"A resource

of [Subtitle C] regulation . . . if . . . such facility . . . receives and burns
only . . . household waste . . . and [nonhazardous industrial] waste . . ."--
establishes that its exemption is limited to the facility itself, not the ash
that the facility generates. The statutory text's prominent omission
of any reference to generation, not the single reference thereto in the
legislative history, is the authoritative expression of the law. The enacted text requires rejection of the Government's plea for deference
to the EPA's interpretation, which goes beyond the scope of whatever
ambiguity $ 3001(i) contains. Pp. 331-339.

330 CHICAGO v. ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND

Opinion of the Court
Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
We are called upon to decide whether, pursuant to $ 3001(i)
of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA)), as added, 98 Stat. 3252,
42 U. S. C. $ 6921(i), the ash generated by a resource recovery facility's incineration of municipal solid waste is exempt
from regulation as a hazardous waste under Subtitle C of
RCRA.

I

Since 1971, petitioner city of Chicago has owned and operated a municipal incinerator, the Northwest Waste-toEnergy Facility, that burns solid waste and recovers energy,
leaving a residue of municipal waste combustion (MWC) ash.
The facility burns approximately 350,000 tons of solid waste
each year and produces energy that is both used within the
facility and sold to other entities. The city has disposed of
the combustion residue--110,000 to 140,000 tons of MWC ash
per year--at landfills that are not licensed to accept hazardous wastes.

In 1988, respondent Environmental Defense Fund (EDF)
filed a complaint against petitioners, the city of Chicago and
its mayor, under the citizen suit provisions of RCRA, 42
U. S. C. $ 6972, alleging that they were violating provisions
of RCRA and of implementing regulations issued by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Respondent alleged that the MWC ash generated by the facility was toxic
enough to qualify as a "hazardous waste" under EPA's regulations, 40 CFR pt. 261 (1993). It was uncontested that,
with respect to the ash, petitioners had not adhered to any
of the requirements of Subtitle C, the portion of RCRA
addressing hazardous wastes. Petitioners contended that

Opinion of the Court
RCRA $ 3001(i), 42 U. S. C. $ 6921(i), excluded the MWC ashfrom those requirements. The District Court agreed with

that contention, see Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v.Chicago, 727 F. Supp. 419, 424 (1989), and subsequently
granted petitioners' motion for summary judgment.The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the "ash
generated from the incinerators of municipal resource re-covery facilities is subject to regulation as a hazardous waste
under Subtitle C of RCRA." Environmental Defense

Solicitor General to present the views of the United States.
Chicago v. Environmental Defense Fund, Inc., 504 U. S. 906(1992). On September 18, 1992, while that invitation was

outstanding, the Administrator of EPA issued a memoran-dum to EPA Regional Administrators, directing them, in accordance with the agency's view of $ 3001(i), to treat MWCash as exempt from hazardous waste regulation under Subtitle C of RCRA. Thereafter, we granted the city's petition,vacated the decision, and remanded the case to the Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit for further considerationin light of the memorandum.

On remand, the Court of Appeals reinstated its previousopinion, holding that, because the statute's plain language

directed hazardous waste generators to comply with han-dling, recordkeeping, storage, and monitoring requirements,

see 40 CFR pt. 262 (1993). TSDF's, however, are subject tomuch more stringent regulation than either generators or
transporters, including a 4- to 5-year permitting process, see42 U. S. C. $ 6925; 40 CFR pt. 270 (1993); U. S. Environmental
Protection Agency Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, The Nation's Hazardous Waste Management Program at a Crossroads, The RCRA Implementation Study
49-50 (July 1990), burdensome financial assurance requirements, stringent design and location standards, and, perhaps
most onerous of all, responsibility to take corrective action
for releases of hazardous substances and to ensure safe closure of each facility, see 42 U. S. C. $ 6924; 40 CFR pt. 264
(1993). "[The] corrective action requirement is one of the
major reasons that generators and transporters work diligently to manage their wastes so as to avoid the need to
obtain interim status or a TSD permit." 3 Environmental
Law Practice Guide $ 29.06[3][d] (M. Gerrard ed. 1993) (hereinafter Practice Guide).

hazardous waste designations for solid wastes appeared in
1980, see 45 Fed. Reg. 33084, they contained certain exceptions from normal coverage, including an exclusion for
"household waste," defined as "any waste material . . . derived from households (including single and multiple residences, hotels and motels)," id., at 33120, codified as amended
at 40 CFR $ 261.4(b)(1) (1993). Although most household
waste is harmless, a small portion--such as cleaning fluids

and batteries--would have qualified as hazardous waste.The regulation declared, however, that "[h]ousehold waste,

including household waste that has been collected, trans-ported, stored, treated, disposed, recovered (e. g., refusederived fuel) or reused" is not hazardous waste. Ibid.
Moreover, the preamble to the 1980 regulations stated that"residues remaining after treatment (

e. g. incineration, thermal treatment) [of household waste] are not subject to regu-lation as a hazardous waste." 45 Fed. Reg. 33099. By reason of these provisions, an incinerator that burned onlyhousehold waste would not be considered a Subtitle C TSDF,
since it processed only nonhazardous (i. e., household) waste,
and it would not be considered a Subtitle C generator of
hazardous waste and would be free to dispose of its ash in
a Subtitle D landfill.

The 1980 regulations thus provided what is known as a
"waste stream" exemption for household waste, ibid., i. e.,
an exemption covering that category of waste from generation through treatment to final disposal of residues. The
regulation did not, however, exempt MWC ash from Subtitle C coverage if the incinerator that produced the ash
burned anything in addition to household waste, such as
what petitioners' facility burns: nonhazardous industrial
waste. Thus, a facility like petitioners' would qualify as a
Subtitle C hazardous waste generator if the MWC ash it
produced was sufficiently toxic, see 40 CFR $$ 261.3, 261.24
(1993)--though it would still not qualify as a Subtitle C
TSDF, since all the waste it took in would be characterized
as nonhazardous. (An ash can be hazardous, even though
the product from which it is generated is not, because in the
new medium the contaminants are more concentrated and
more readily leachable, see 40 CFR $$ 261.3, 261.24, and
pt. 261, App. II (1993).)

Four years after these regulations were issued, Congress
enacted the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of
1984, Pub. L. 98-616, 98 Stat. 3221, which added to RCRA

Opinion of the Court
the "Clarification of Household Waste Exclusion" as $ 3001(i),$ 223, 98 Stat. 3252. The essence of our task in this case is

to determine whether, under that provision, the MWC ashgenerated by petitioners' facility--a facility that would have
been considered a Subtitle C generator under the 1980 regulations--is subject to regulation as hazardous waste underSubtitle C. We conclude that it is.

Section 3001(i), 42 U. S. C. $ 6921(i), entitled "Clarificationof household waste exclusion," provides:

"A resource recovery facility recovering energy from
the mass burning of municipal solid waste shall not be
deemed to be treating, storing, disposing of, or other-wise managing hazardous wastes for the purposes of

regulation under this subchapter, if--"(1) such facility--

"(A) receives and burns only--"(i) household waste (from single and multiple dwellings, hotels, motels, and other residential sources), and

"(ii) solid waste from commercial or industrialsources that does not contain hazardous waste identified

or listed under this section, and"(B) does not accept hazardous wastes identified or
listed under this section, and"(2) the owner or operator of such facility has established contractual requirements or other appropriatenotification or inspection procedures to assure that hazardous wastes are not received at or burned in such
facility."

The plain meaning of this language is that so long as a
facility recovers energy by incineration of the appropriate
wastes, it (the facility) is not subject to Subtitle C regulation
as a facility that treats, stores, disposes of, or manages hazardous waste. The provision quite clearly does not contain
any exclusion for the ash itself. Indeed, the waste the facility produces (as opposed to that which it receives) is not even

Opinion of the Court
mentioned. There is thus no express support for petition-ers' claim of a waste-stream exemption.

1

Petitioners contend, however, that the practical effect ofthe statutory language is to exempt the ash by virtue of

exempting the facility. If, they argue, the facility is notdeemed to be treating, storing, or disposing of hazardous
waste, then the ash that it treats, stores, or disposes of mustitself be considered nonhazardous. There are several problems with this argument. First, as we have explained, theonly exemption provided by the terms of the statute is for
the facility. It is the facility, not the ash, that "shall not bedeemed" to be subject to regulation under Subtitle C.

Unlike the preamble to the 1980 regulations, which had been inexistence for four years by the time $ 3001(i) was enacted,

$ 3001(i) does not explicitly exempt MWC ash generated bya resource recovery facility from regulation as a hazardous
waste. In light of that difference, and given the statute'sexpress declaration of national policy that "[w]aste that is . . .
generated should be treated, stored, or disposed of so as tominimize the present and future threat to human health and
the environment," 42 U. S. C. $ 6902(b), we cannot interpret
the statute to permit MWC ash sufficiently toxic to qualifyas hazardous to be disposed of in ordinary landfills.

Moreover, as the Court of Appeals observed, the statutorylanguage does not even exempt the

facility in its capacity as

1 The dissent is able to describe the provision as exempting the ash itself
only by resorting to what might be called imaginative use of ellipsis:
"even though the material being treated and disposed of contains hazardous components before, during, and after its treatment[,] that material
`shall not be deemed to be . . . hazardous.' " Post, at 346. In the full
text, quoted above, the subject of the phrase "shall not be deemed . . .
hazardous" is not the material, but the resource recovery facility, and the
complete phrase, including (italicized) the ellipsis, reads "shall not be
deemed to be treating, storing, disposing of, or otherwise managing hazardous wastes." Deeming a facility not to be engaged in these activities
with respect to hazardous wastes is of course quite different from deeming
the output of that facility not to be hazardous.

Opinion of the Court
a generator of hazardous waste. RCRA defines "genera-tion" as "the act or process of producing hazardous waste."

42 U. S. C. $ 6903(6). There can be no question that thecreation of ash by incinerating municipal waste constitutes
"generation" of hazardous waste (assuming, of course, thatthe ash qualifies as hazardous under 42 U. S. C. $ 6921 and
its implementing regulations, 40 CFR pt. 261 (1993)). Yetalthough $ 3001(i) states that the exempted facility "shall not
be deemed to be treating, storing, disposing of, or otherwisemanaging hazardous wastes," it significantly omits from the
catalog the word "generating." Petitioners say that becausethe activities listed as exempt encompass the full scope of
the facility's operation, the failure to mention the activityof generating is insignificant. But the statute itself refutes
this. Each of the three specific terms used in $ 3001(i)--"treating," "storing," and "disposing of "--is separately defined by RCRA, and none covers the production of hazardouswaste.

2 The fourth and less specific term ("otherwise managing") is also defined, to mean "collection, source separa-tion, storage, transportation, processing, treatment, recovery, and disposal," 42 U. S. C. $ 6903(7)--just about everyhazardous waste-related activity except generation. We

2 "Treatment" means "any method, technique, or process, including neutralization, designed to change the physical, chemical, or biological character or composition of any hazardous waste so as to neutralize such waste
or so as to render such waste nonhazardous, safer for transport, amenable
for recovery, amenable for storage, or reduced in volume. Such term includes any activity or processing designed to change the physical form or
chemical composition of hazardous waste so as to render it nonhazardous."
42 U. S. C. $ 6903(34).

"Storage" means "the containment of hazardous waste, either on a temporary basis or for a period of years, in such a manner as not to constitute
disposal of such hazardous waste." $ 6903(33).

"Disposal" means "the discharge, deposit, injection, dumping, spilling,
leaking, or placing of any solid waste or hazardous waste into or on any
land or water so that such solid waste or hazardous waste or any constituent thereof may enter the environment or be emitted into the air or
discharged into any waters." $ 6903(3).

Opinion of the Court
think it follows from the carefully constructed text of

$ 3001(i) that while a resource recovery facility's management activities are excluded from Subtitle C regulation, its
generation of toxic ash is not.

Petitioners appeal to the legislative history of $ 3001(i),
which includes, in the Senate Committee Report, the statement that "[a]ll waste management activities of such a facility, including the generation, transportation, treatment,
storage and disposal of waste shall be covered by the exclusion." S. Rep. No. 98-284, p. 61 (1983) (emphasis added).
But it is the statute, and not the Committee Report, which
is the authoritative expression of the law, and the statute
prominently omits reference to generation. As the Court
of Appeals cogently put it: "Why should we, then, rely upon
a single word in a committee report that did not result in
legislation? Simply put, we shouldn't." 948 F. 2d, at 351.3
Petitioners point out that the activity by which they "treat"
municipal waste is the very same activity by which they
"generate" MWC ash, to wit, incineration. But there is
nothing extraordinary about an activity's being exempt for
some purposes and nonexempt for others. The incineration
here is exempt from TSDF regulation, but subject to regulation as hazardous waste generation. (As we have noted, see
supra, at 331-332, the latter is much less onerous.)

Our interpretation is confirmed by comparing $ 3001(i)
with another statutory exemption in RCRA. In the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, Pub.
L. 99-499, $ 124(b), 100 Stat. 1689, Congress amended 42
U. S. C. $ 6921 to provide that an "owner and operator of
equipment used to recover methane from a landfill shall not
be deemed to be managing, generating, transporting, treating, storing, or disposing of hazardous or liquid wastes within

3 Nothing in the dissent's somewhat lengthier discourse on $ 3001(i)'s
legislative history, see post, at 343-345, convinces us that the statute's
omission of the term "generation" is a scrivener's error.

the meaning of " Subtitle C. This provision, in contrast to$ 3001(i), provides a complete exemption by including the

term "generating" in its list of covered activities. "[I]t isgenerally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and
purposely" when it "includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another," Keene Corp. v.
United States, 508 U. S. 200, 208 (1993) (internal quotation
marks omitted). We agree with respondents that this provision "shows that Congress knew how to draft a waste stream
exemption in RCRA when it wanted to." Brief for Respondents 18.

Petitioners contend that our interpretation of $ 3001(i)
turns the provision into an "empty gesture," Brief for
Petitioners 23, since even under the pre-existing regime
an incinerator burning household waste and nonhazardous
industrial waste was exempt from the Subtitle C TSDF
provisions. If $ 3001(i) did not extend the waste-stream
exemption to the product of such a combined household/
nonhazardous-industrial treatment facility, petitioners argue,
it did nothing at all. But it is not nothing to codify a household waste exemption that had previously been subject to
agency revision; nor is it nothing (though petitioners may
value it as less than nothing) to restrict the exemption that
the agency previously provided--which is what the provision
here achieved, by withholding all waste-stream exemption
for waste processed by resource recovery facilities, even for
the waste stream passing through an exclusively household
waste facility.4

4 We express no opinion as to the validity of EPA's household waste
regulation as applied to resource recovery facilities before the effective
date of $ 3001(i). Furthermore, since the statute in question addresses
only resource recovery facilities, not household waste in general, we are
unable to reach any conclusions concerning the validity of EPA's regulatory scheme for household wastes not processed by resource recovery
facilities.

Opinion of the Court
We also do not agree with petitioners' contention that ourconstruction renders $ 3001(i) ineffective for its intended

purpose of promoting household/nonhazardous-industrial re-source recovery facilities, see 42 U. S. C. $$ 6902(a)(1), (10),
(11), by subjecting them "to the potentially enormous ex-pense of managing ash residue as a hazardous waste." Brief
for Petitioners 20. It is simply not true that a facility whichis (as our interpretation says these facilities are) a hazardous
waste "generator" is also deemed to be "managing" hazard-ous waste under RCRA. Section 3001(i) clearly exempts
these facilities from Subtitle C TSDF regulations, thus en-abling them to avoid the "full brunt of EPA's enforcement
efforts under RCRA." Practice Guide $ 29.05[1].

* * *
RCRA's twin goals of encouraging resource recovery andprotecting against contamination sometimes conflict. It is

not unusual for legislation to contain diverse purposes thatmust be reconciled, and the most reliable guide for that task
is the enacted text. Here that requires us to reject the So-licitor General's plea for deference to the EPA's interpretation, cf. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources DefenseCouncil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843-844 (1984), which goes beyond the scope of whatever ambiguity $ 3001(i) contains.See

John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust & Sav.Bank, 510 U. S. 86, 109 (1993). Section 3001(i) simply cannot

be read to contain the cost-saving waste-stream exemptionpetitioners seek.

5

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals for the Seventh Circuit is

Affirmed.
5 In view of our construction of $ 3001(i), we need not consider whether
an agency interpretation expressed in a memorandum like the Administrator's in this case is entitled to any less deference under Chevron than
an interpretation adopted by rule published in the Federal Register, or
by adjudication.

340 CHICAGO v. ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND

Stevens, J., dissenting
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,dissenting.

The statutory provision in question is a 1984 amendmententitled "Clarification of Household Waste Exclusion."

1 To

understand that clarification, we must first examine the"waste exclusion" that the amendment clarified and, more

particularly, the ambiguity that needed clarification. Itherefore begin with a discussion of the relevant pre-1984
law. I then examine the text of the statute as amended andexplain why the apparent tension between the broad definition of the term "hazardous waste generation" in the 1976Act and the more specific exclusion for the activity of incinerating household wastes (and mixtures of household and othernonhazardous wastes) in the 1984 amendment should be resolved by giving effect to the later enactment.

I
When Congress enacted the Resource Conservation andRecovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), it delegated to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) vast regulatory authorityover the mountains of garbage that our society generates.
The statute directed the EPA to classify waste as hazardousor nonhazardous and to establish regulatory controls over
the disposition of the two categories of waste pursuant toSubtitles C and D of RCRA. 42 U. S. C. $ 6921(a); see ante,
at 331-332. To that end, the EPA in 1980 promulgated de-tailed regulations establishing a federal hazardous waste
management system pursuant to Subtitle C.Generally, though not always, the EPA regulations assume
that waste is properly characterized as hazardous or nonhaz-ardous when it first becomes waste. Based on that charac1 Section 223 of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984
amended $ 3001 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976.
See 98 Stat. 3252; 42 U. S. C. $ 6921(i). The text of the provision is quoted
ante, at 334.

terization, the waste is regulated under either Subtitle C
or D. Household waste is regarded as nonhazardous when
it is first discarded and, as long as it is not mixed with hazardous waste, it retains that characterization during and
after its treatment and disposal. Even though it contains
some materials that would be classified as hazardous in other
contexts, and even though its treatment may produce a residue that contains a higher concentration of hazardous matter
than when the garbage was originally discarded, such waste
is regulated as nonhazardous waste under Subtitle D. See
ante, at 332-333. Thus, an incinerator that burns nothing
but household waste might "generate" tons of hazardous residue, but as a statutory matter it still is deemed to be processing nonhazardous waste and is regulated as a Subtitle D,
rather than Subtitle C, facility.

Section 261.4(b)(1) of the EPA's 1980 regulations first established the household waste exclusion. See 45 Fed. Reg.
33120 (1980). The relevant text of that regulation simply
provided that solid wastes derived from households (including single and multiple residences, hotels, and motels) were
"not hazardous wastes." 2 The regulation itself said nothing about the status of the residue that remains after the
incineration of such household waste. An accompanying
comment, however, unambiguously explained that "residues
remaining after treatment (e. g. incineration, thermal treatment) are not subject to regulation as hazardous waste."
Id., at 33099. Thus, the administrative history of the 1980

2 The full text of 40 CFR $ 261.4(b)(1) (1993) reads as follows:
"(b) Solid Wastes which are not hazardous wastes. The following solid
wastes are not hazardous wastes:

"(1) Household waste, including household waste that has been collected, transported, stored, treated, disposed, recovered (e. g., refusederived fuel) or reused. `Household waste' means any waste material (including garbage, trash and sanitary wastes in septic tanks) derived from
households (including single and multiple residences, hotels and motels)."

Stevens, J., dissenting
regulation, rather than its text, revealed why a municipalincinerator burning household waste was not treated as a

generator of hazardous waste.The EPA's explanatory comment contained an important
warning: If household waste was "mixed with other hazardous wastes," the entire mixture would be deemed hazard-ous.

3 Yet neither the comment nor the regulation itself

identified the consequences of mixing household waste withother wastes that are entirely

nonhazardous.4 Presumably
such a mixture would contain a lower percentage of hazard-ous material than pure household waste, and therefore

should also be classified as nonhazardous--assumptions thatare not inconsistent with the EPA's warning that mixing
household waste "with other hazardous wastes" wouldterminate the household waste exemption. The EPA's
failure to comment expressly on the significance of adding
100 percent nonhazardous commercial or industrial waste
nevertheless warranted further clarification.

Congress enacted that clarification in 1984. Elaborating
upon the EPA's warning in 1980, the text of the 1984 amendment--$ 3001(i) of RCRA, 42 U. S. C. $ 6921(i)--made clear
that a facility treating a mixture of household waste and
"solid waste from commercial or industrial sources that does
not contain hazardous waste," $ 6921(i)(1)(A)(ii), shall not be

3 "When household waste is mixed with other hazardous wastes, however, the entire mixture will be deemed hazardous in accord with

$ 261.3(a)(2)(ii) of these regulations except when they are mixed with hazardous wastes produced by small quantity generators (see $ 261.5). While
household waste may not be hazardous per se, it is like any other solid
waste. Thus a mixture of household and hazardous (except those just
noted) wastes is also regulated as a hazardous waste under these regulations." 45 Fed. Reg. 33099 (1980).

4 In this regard, because the regulations left unexplained the ramifications of mixing household waste with nonhousehold waste that is not hazardous, the Court errs by asserting unqualifiedly that the Chicago incinerator "would have been considered a Subtitle C generator under the 1980
regulations." Ante, at 334.

deemed to be treating hazardous waste. In other words, the
addition of nonhazardous waste derived from other sources
does not extinguish the household waste exclusion.

The parallel between the 1980 regulation and the 1984
statutory amendment is striking. In 1980 the EPA referred
to the exclusion of household waste "in all phases of its management." 5 Similarly, the 1984 statute lists all phases of
the incinerator's management when it states that a facility
recovering energy from the mass burning of a mixture of
household waste and other solid waste that does not contain
hazardous waste "shall not be deemed to be treating, storing,
disposing of, or otherwise managing hazardous wastes."
See 42 U. S. C. $ 6921(i). Even though that text only refers
to the exemption of the facility that burns the waste, the
title of the section significantly characterizes it as a waste
exclusion. Moreover, the title's description of the amendment as a "clarification" identifies an intent to codify its
counterpart in the 1980 regulation.

The Report of the Senate Committee that recommended
the enactment of $ 3001(i) demonstrates that the sponsors of
the legislation understood it to have the same meaning as
the 1980 EPA regulation that it "clarified." That Report,
which is worth setting out in some detail, first notes that the
reported bill adds the amendment to $ 3001 "to clarify the
coverage of the household waste exclusion with respect to
resource recovery facilities recovering energy through the
mass burning of municipal solid waste." S. Rep. No. 98-284,
p. 61 (1983). The EPA had promulgated the exclusion "in
its hazardous waste management regulations established to
exclude waste streams generated by consumers at the household level and by sources whose wastes are sufficiently simi5 "Since household waste is excluded in all phases of its management,
residues remaining after treatment (e. g. incineration, thermal treatment)
are not subject to regulation as hazardous waste." 45 Fed. Reg. 33099

lar in both quantity and quality to those of households."
Ibid. The Report explains that resource recovery facilities
frequently take in household wastes that are mixed with
other nonhazardous waste streams from a variety of commercial and industrial sources, and emphasizes the importance of encouraging commercially viable resource recovery
facilities. Ibid. To that end, "[n]ew section [3001(i)] clarifies the original intent to include within the household waste
exclusion activities of a resource recovery facility which
recovers energy from the mass burning of household waste
and non-hazardous waste from other sources." Ibid. The
Report further explains:

"All waste management activities of such a facility, including the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of waste shall be covered by the exclusion, if the limitations in paragraphs (1) and (2) of [the
amendment] are met. First, such facilities must receive
and burn only household waste and solid waste from
other sources which does not contain hazardous waste
identified or listed under section 3001.

"Second, such facilities cannot accept hazardous wastes
identified or listed under section 3001 from commercial
or industrial sources, and must establish contractual
requirements or other notification or inspection procedures to assure that such wastes are not received or
burned. This provision requires precautionary measures or procedures which can be shown to be effective
safeguards against the unintended acceptance of hazardous waste. If such measures are in place, a resource
recovery facility whose activities would normally be
covered by the household waste exclusion should not be
penalized for the occasional, inadvertent receipt and
burning of hazardous material from such commercial or
industrial sources. Facilities must monitor the waste
they receive and, if necessary, revise the precautionary

measures they establish to assure against the receipt ofsuch hazardous waste." Ibid.

These comments referred to the Senate bill that becamelaw after a majority of the Senate followed the Committee's
recommendation "that the bill (as amended) do pass." Id.,at 1.

6 Given this commentary, it is quite unrealistic to assume that the omission of the word "generating" from theparticularized description of management activities in the

statute was intended to render the statutory description anyless inclusive than either the 1980 regulation or the Committee Report. It is even more unrealistic to assume that legis-lators voting on the 1984 amendment would have detected
any difference between the statutory text and the Commit-tee's summary just because the term "generating" does not
appear in the 1984 amendment. A commonsense reading ofthe statutory text in the light of the Committee Report and
against the background of the 1980 regulation reveals an ob-vious purpose to

preserve, not to change, the existing rule.7

6 The Conference Committee adopted the Senate amendment verbatim.
Its Report stated: "The Senate amendment clarifies that an energy recovery facility is exempt from hazardous waste requirements if it burns only
residential and non-hazardous commercial wastes and establishes procedures to assure hazardous wastes will not be burned at the facility."
H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 98-1133, p. 106 (1984).

7 The majority's refusal to attach significance to " `a single word in a

committee report,' " ante, at 337, reveals either a misunderstanding of, or
a lack of respect for, the function of legislative committees. The purpose
of a committee report is to provide the Members of Congress who have
not taken part in the committee's deliberations with a summary of the
provisions of the bill and the reasons for the committee's recommendation
that the bill should become law. The report obviously does not have the
force of law. Yet when the text of a bill is not changed after it leaves
the committee, the Members are entitled to assume that the report fairly
summarizes the proposed legislation. What makes this Report significant
is not the single word "generation," but the unmistakable intent to maintain an existing rule of law. The omission of the single word "generating"
from the statute has no more significance than the omission of the same
word from the text of the 1980 regulation.

The relevant statutory text is not as unambiguous as theCourt asserts. There is substantial tension between the

broad definition of the term "hazardous waste generation" in$ 1004(6) of RCRA and the household waste exclusion codified by the 1984 amendment: Both provisions can be readto describe the same activity. The former "means the act
or process of producing hazardous waste." 90 Stat. 2799;42 U. S. C. $ 6903(6). Read literally, that definition is broad
enough to encompass the burning of pure household wastethat produces some hazardous residue. The only statutory
escape from that conclusion is the 1984 amendment that pro-vides an exemption for the activity of burning household
waste. Yet that exemption does not distinguish betweenpure household waste, on the one hand, and a mixture of
household and other nonhazardous wastes, on the other. Iteither exempts both the pure stream and the mixture, or it
exempts neither.Indeed, commercial and industrial waste is by definition
nonhazardous: In order for it to fall within the exclusioncreated by the 1984 amendment, it must not contain hazardous components. As a consequence, the only aspect of thiswaste stream that would ordinarily be regulated by Subtitle
C of RCRA is the ash residue. EPA could reasonably con-clude, therefore, that to give any content to the statute with
respect to this component of the waste stream, the incinera-tor ash must be exempted from Subtitle C regulation.

The exemption states that a facility burning solid waste"shall not be deemed to be treating, storing, disposing of, or
otherwise managing hazardous wastes for the purposes ofregulation under this subchapter" if two conditions are satisfied. See ante, at 334. As long as the two conditions aremet--even though the material being treated and disposed
of contains hazardous components before, during, and afterits treatment--that material "shall not be deemed to be . . .
hazardous." By characterizing both the input and the out511us2$43I 11-03-97 18:42:25 PAGES OPINPGT

would otherwise apply. For it is obvious that the same ac-tivity cannot both subject a facility to regulation because
its residue is hazardous and exempt the facility from regu-lation because the statute deems the same residue to be
nonhazardous.8Thus, if we are to be guided only by the literal meaning of
the statutory text, we must either give effect to the broaddefinition of hazardous waste generation and subject all
municipal incinerators that generate hazardous ash to Sub-title C regulation (including those that burn pure household
waste) or give effect to the exclusion that applies equally topure household waste and mixtures that include other nonhazardous wastes. For several reasons the latter is theproper choice. It effectuates the narrower and more recently enacted provision rather than the earlier more gen-eral definition. It respects the title of the 1984 amendment
by treating what follows as a "clarification" rather than arepeal or a modification. It avoids the Court's rather surprising (and uninvited) decision to invalidate the householdwaste exclusion that the EPA adopted in 1980,

8 The Court characterizes my reading of the text as "imaginative use
of ellipsis," ante, at 335, n. 1, because the subject of the predicate "shall
not be deemed to be . . . hazardous" is the recovery facility rather than
the residue that is disposed of after the waste is burned. That is true,
but the reason the facility is exempted is because it is not "deemed to be
. . . disposing of . . . hazardous wastes." Thus it is the statutorily deemed
nonhazardous character of the object of the sentence--wastes--that effectively exempts from Subtitle C regulation the activity and the facility
engaged in that activity. If, as the statute provides, a facility is not
deemed to be disposing of hazardous wastes when it disposes of the output
of the facility, it must be true that the output is deemed nonhazardous.

9 Although the first nine pages of the Court's opinion give the reader

the impression that the 1980 regulatory exclusion for pure household
waste was valid, the Court ultimately acknowledges that its construction
of the statute has the effect of "withholding all waste-stream exemption

The majority's decision today may represent sound policy.Requiring cities to spend the necessary funds to dispose of

their incinerator residues in accordance with the strict re-quirements of Subtitle C will provide additional protections
to the environment. It is also true, however, that the con-servation of scarce landfill space and the encouragement of
the recovery of energy and valuable materials in municipalwastes were major concerns motivating RCRA's enactment.
Whether those purposes will be disserved by regulatingmunicipal incinerators under Subtitle C and, if so, whether
environmental benefits may nevertheless justify the costs ofsuch additional regulation are questions of policy that we are

UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ-SANCHEZ
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 92-1812. Argued March 1, 1994--Decided May 2, 1994
Nearly three days after local law enforcement officers arrested respondent

on state narcotics charges, and while he was still in the custody of those
officers, respondent confessed to United States Secret Service agents
that he knew that Federal Reserve Notes the local officers had discovered while searching his home were counterfeit. The agents arrested
him for possessing counterfeit currency and presented him on a federal
complaint the following day. The Federal District Court refused to
suppress the confession, rejecting, inter alia, respondent's argument
that the delay between his arrest on state charges and his presentment
on the federal charge rendered the confession inadmissible under 18
U. S. C. $ 3501(c), which provides that a confession made while a defendant is "under arrest or other detention in the custody of any lawenforcement officer or law-enforcement agency, shall not be inadmissible
solely because of delay in bringing such person before [a judicial officer]
empowered to commit persons charged with offenses against the laws
of the United States" if the confession was made voluntarily and "within
six hours" following the arrest or other detention. Respondent was
convicted. In vacating the conviction, the Court of Appeals reasoned
that, by negative implication, $ 3501(c) permits suppression in cases
where a confession is made outside the subsection's 6-hour post-arrest
safe harbor period. The court concluded that $ 3501(c) applied to respondent's statement because respondent was in custody and had not
been presented to a magistrate at the time he confessed, and held that
the confession should have been suppressed.

Held: Section 3501(c) does not apply to statements made by a person who

is being held solely on state charges. Pp. 355-360.

(a) The subsection's text clearly indicates that its terms were never
triggered in this case. Respondent errs in suggesting that, because the
statute refers to a person in the custody of "any" law enforcement officer
or agency, the 6-hour time period begins to run whenever a person is
arrested by local, state, or federal officers. The subsection can apply
only when there is some "delay" in presenting a person to a federal
judicial officer. Because the term delay presumes an obligation to act,
there can be no "delay" in bringing a person before a federal judicial
officer until there is some obligation to do so in the first place. Such a

Opinion of the Court
duty does not arise until the person is arrested or detained for a federal
crime. Although a person arrested on a federal charge by any officer--
local, state, or federal--is under "arrest or other detention" for the purposes of $ 3501(c) and its safe harbor period, one arrested on state
charges is not. This is true even if the arresting officers believe or
have cause to believe that federal law also has been violated, because
such a belief does not alter the underlying basis for the arrest and subsequent custody. Pp. 355-358.

(b) Respondent was under arrest on state charges when he made his
inculpatory statement to the Secret Service agents. Section 3501(c)'s
terms thus did not come into play until he was arrested on a federal
charge--after he made the statement. That he was never arraigned or
prosecuted on the state charges does not alter this conclusion. Finally,
there is no need to consider the situation that would arise if state or
local authorities and federal officers act in collusion to obtain a confession in violation of a defendant's right to a prompt federal presentment,
because in this case there was no such collusive arrangement, only routine cooperation between law enforcement agencies. Pp. 359-360.

federal magistrate, rendered inadmissible the custodialstatement he made more than six hours after his arrest on

state criminal charges. We conclude, however, that $ 3501(c)does not apply to statements made by a person who is being
held solely on state charges. Accordingly, we reverse thejudgment of the Court of Appeals.

I
On Friday, August 5, 1988, officers of the Los AngelesSheriff 's Department obtained a warrant to search respondent's residence for heroin and other evidence of narcotics dis-tribution. While executing the warrant later that day, the
officers discovered not only narcotics, but $2,260 in counter-feit Federal Reserve Notes. Respondent was arrested and
booked on state felony narcotics charges at approximately5:40 p.m. He spent the weekend in custody.

On Monday morning, August 8, the Sheriff 's Departmentinformed the United States Secret Service of the counterfeit
currency found in respondent's residence. Two Secret Serv-ice agents arrived at the Sheriff 's Department shortly before
midday to take possession of the currency and to interviewrespondent. Using a deputy sheriff as an interpreter, the
agents informed respondent of his rights under Miranda v.
Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). After waiving these rights,respondent admitted that he had known that the currency

was counterfeit. The agents arrested respondent shortlythereafter, took him to the Secret Service field office for
booking, and prepared a criminal complaint. Due to conges-tion in the Federal Magistrate's docket, respondent was not
presented on the federal complaint until the following day.1Respondent was indicted for unlawful possession of counterfeit currency in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 472. Prior totrial, he moved to suppress the statement he had made dur1 For reasons that are not apparent from the record, respondent was
never arraigned or prosecuted by the State of California on the state
drug charges.

ing his interview with the Secret Service agents. He ar-gued that his confession was made without a voluntary and

knowing waiver of his Miranda rights, and that the delaybetween his arrest on state charges and his presentment on
the federal charge rendered his confession inadmissibleunder 18 U. S. C. $ 3501(c).

2 The District Court rejected

2 Title 18 U. S. C. $ 3501 provides:
"(a) In any criminal prosecution brought by the United States or by the
District of Columbia, a confession, as defined in subsection (e) hereof, shall
be admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given. Before such confession
is received in evidence, the trial judge shall, out of the presence of the
jury, determine any issue as to voluntariness. If the trial judge determines that the confession was voluntarily made it shall be admitted in
evidence . . . .

"(b) The trial judge in determining the issue of voluntariness shall take
into consideration all the circumstances surrounding the giving of the confession, including (1) the time elapsing between arrest and arraignment of
the defendant making the confession, if it was made after arrest and before arraignment . . . .

"The presence or absence of any of the above-mentioned factors to be
taken into consideration by the judge need not be conclusive on the issue
of voluntariness of the confession.

"(c) In any criminal prosecution by the United States or by the District
of Columbia, a confession made or given by a person who is a defendant
therein, while such person was under arrest or other detention in the
custody of any law-enforcement officer or law-enforcement agency, shall
not be inadmissible solely because of delay in bringing such person before
a magistrate or other officer empowered to commit persons charged with
offenses against the laws of the United States or of the District of Columbia if such confession is found by the trial judge to have been made voluntarily and if the weight to be given the confession is left to the jury and
if such confession was made or given by such person within six hours
immediately following his arrest or other detention: Provided, That the
time limitation contained in this subsection shall not apply in any case in
which the delay in bringing such person before such magistrate or other
officer beyond such six-hour period is found by the trial judge to be reasonable considering the means of transportation and the distance to be traveled to the nearest available such magistrate or other officer.

"(d) Nothing contained in this section shall bar the admission in evidence of any confession made or given voluntarily by any person to any
other person without interrogation by anyone, or at any time at which

Opinion of the Court
both contentions and denied the motion. Respondent subse-quently was convicted after a jury trial at which the statement was admitted into evidence.The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
vacated the conviction. 975 F. 2d 1396 (1992). The courtfirst outlined the exclusionary rule developed by this Court
in a line of cases including McNabb v. United States, 318U. S. 332 (1943), and

Mallory v. United States, 354 U. S. 449(1957). The so-called McNabb-Mallory rule, adopted by

this Court "[i]n the exercise of its supervisory authority overthe administration of criminal justice in the federal courts,"
McNabb, supra, at 341, generally rendered inadmissible con-fessions made during periods of detention that violated the
prompt presentment requirement of Rule 5(a) of the FederalRules of Criminal Procedure. See

Mallory, supra, at 453.Rule 5(a) provides that a person arrested for a federal offense shall be taken "without unnecessary delay" before thenearest federal magistrate, or before a state or local judicial
officer authorized to set bail for federal offenses under 18U. S. C. $ 3041, for a first appearance, or presentment.

The Ninth Circuit went on to discuss the interrelated pro-visions of 18 U. S. C. $ 3501 and the decisions of the Courts
of Appeals that have sought to discern the extent to whichthis statute curtailed the

McNabb-Mallory rule. Section3501(a), the court observed, states that a confession "shall be

admitted in evidence" if voluntarily made, and $ 3501(b) listsseveral nonexclusive factors that the trial judge should consider when making the voluntariness determination, includ-ing "the time elapsing between arrest and arraignment of
the defendant making the confession, if it was made afterarrest and before arraignment." Section 3501(c) provides

the person who made or gave such confession was not under arrest or
other detention.

"(e) As used in this section, the term `confession' means any confession
of guilt of any criminal offense or any self-incriminating statement made
or given orally or in writing."

Opinion of the Court
that a confession made by a person within six hours followinghis arrest or other detention "shall not be inadmissible"

solely because of delay in presenting the person to a federalmagistrate. The Ninth Circuit construed $ 3501(c) as precluding suppression under McNabb-Mallory of any confes-sion made during this "safe harbor" period following arrest.
975 F. 2d, at 1399. The court then reasoned that, by nega-tive implication, $ 3501(c) must in some circumstances allow
suppression of a confession made more than six hours afterarrest solely on the basis of pre-presentment delay, "regardless of the voluntariness of the confession." Id., at 1401.The court thus concluded that the

McNabb-Mallory rule, ineither a pure or slightly modified form, applies to confessions

made after the expiration of the safe harbor period.Turning to the facts of the case before it, the court determined that $ 3501(c) applied to respondent's statement be-cause respondent was in custody and had not been presented
to a magistrate at the time of the interview. The court con-cluded that the statement fell outside the subsection's safe
harbor because it was not made until Monday afternoon,nearly three days after respondent's arrest on state charges.
975 F. 2d, at 1405, and n. 8 (citing United States v. Fouche,776 F. 2d 1398, 1406 (CA9 1985)). Because the statement
was not made within the $ 3501(c) safe harbor period, thecourt applied both its pure and modified versions of the
McNabb-Mallory rule and held that, under either approach,the confession should have been suppressed. 975 F. 2d, at
1405-1406.We granted the Government's petition for a writ of certiorari in order to consider the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of$ 3501. 510 U. S. 912 (1993).

II
The parties argue at some length over the proper interpre-tation of subsections (a) and (c) of 18 U. S. C. $ 3501, and,

in particular, over the question whether $ 3501(c) requires

511us2$44N 11-03-97 18:43:45 PAGES OPINPGT
356 UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ-SANCHEZ

Opinion of the Court
suppression of a confession that is made by an arrestee priorto presentment and more than six hours after arrest, regardless of whether the confession was voluntarily made. TheGovernment contends that through $ 3501, Congress repudiated the McNabb-Mallory rule in its entirety. Under thistheory, $ 3501(c) creates a safe harbor that prohibits suppression on grounds of pre-presentment delay if a confessionis made within six hours following arrest, but says nothing about the admissibility of a confession given beyond that6-hour period. The admissibility of such a confession, the
Government argues, is controlled by $ 3501(a), which pro-vides that voluntary confessions "shall be admitted in
evidence."Largely agreeing with the Ninth Circuit, respondent contends that $ 3501(c) codified a limited form of the McNabb-Mallory rule--one that requires the suppression of a confession made before presentment but after the expiration of thesafe harbor period. A contrary interpretation of $ 3501(c),
respondent argues, would render that subsection meaning-less in the face of $ 3501(a).

As the parties recognize, however, we need not addresssubtle questions of statutory construction concerning the
safe harbor set out in $ 3501(c), or resolve any tension be-tween the provisions of that subsection and those of

$ 3501(a), if we determine that the terms of $ 3501(c) werenever triggered in this case. We turn, then, to that threshold inquiry.When interpreting a statute, we look first and foremost to
its text. Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249,253-254 (1992). Section 3501(c) provides that in any federal
criminal prosecution,

"a confession made or given by a person who is a defend-ant therein, while such person was under arrest or other

detention in the custody of any law-enforcement officeror law-enforcement agency, shall not be inadmissible
solely because of delay in bringing such person before a

Opinion of the Court
magistrate or other officer empowered to commit per-sons charged with offenses against the laws of the

United States or of the District of Columbia if such con-fession is found by the trial judge to have been made
voluntarily and if . . . such confession was made or givenby such person within six hours immediately following
his arrest or other detention."
Respondent contends that he was under "arrest or other de-tention" for purposes of $ 3501(c) during the interview at the

Sheriff 's Department, and that his statement to the SecretService agents constituted a confession governed by this
subsection. In respondent's view, it is irrelevant that hewas in the custody of the local authorities, rather than that
of the federal agents, when he made the statement. Be-cause the statute applies to persons in the custody of "any"
law enforcement officer or law enforcement agency, respond-ent suggests that the $ 3501(c) 6-hour time period begins
to run whenever a person is arrested by local, state, orfederal officers.

We believe respondent errs in placing dispositive weighton the broad statutory reference to "any" law enforcement
officer or agency without considering the rest of the statute.Section 3501(c) provides that, if certain conditions are met,
a confession made by a person under "arrest or other deten-tion" shall not be inadmissible in a subsequent federal prosecution "solely because of delay in bringing such person be-fore a magistrate or other officer empowered to commit
persons charged with offenses against the laws of the UnitedStates or of the District of Columbia." 18 U. S. C. $ 3501(c)
(emphasis added). Clearly, the terms of the subsection canapply only when there is some "delay" in presentment. Because "delay" is not defined in the statute, we must construethe term "in accordance with its ordinary or natural meaning." FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U. S. 471, 476 (1994). To delay is"[t]o postpone until a later time" or to "put off an action"; a
delay is a "postponement." American Heritage Dictionary

358 UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ-SANCHEZ

Opinion of the Court
493 (3d ed. 1992). The term presumes an obligation to act.
Thus, there can be no "delay" in bringing a person before a
federal magistrate until, at a minimum, there is some obligation to bring the person before such a judicial officer in the
first place. Plainly, a duty to present a person to a federal
magistrate does not arise until the person has been arrested
for a federal offense. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 5(a) (requiring initial appearance before a federal magistrate).3
Until a person is arrested or detained for a federal crime,
there is no duty, obligation, or reason to bring him before a
judicial officer "empowered to commit persons charged with
offenses against the laws of the United States," and therefore, no "delay" under $ 3501(c) can occur.

In short, it is evident "from the context in which [the
phrase] is used," Deal v. United States, 508 U. S. 129, 132
(1993), that the "arrest or other detention" of which the subsection speaks must be an "arrest or other detention" for a
violation of federal law. If a person is arrested and held on
a federal charge by "any" law enforcement officer--federal,
state, or local--that person is under "arrest or other detention" for purposes of $ 3501(c) and its 6-hour safe harbor period. If, instead, the person is arrested and held on state
charges, $ 3501(c) does not apply, and the safe harbor is not
implicated. This is true even if the arresting officers (who,
when the arrest is for a violation of state law, almost certainly will be agents of the State or one of its subdivisions)
believe or have cause to believe that the person also may
have violated federal law. Such a belief, which may not be
uncommon given that many activities are criminalized under
both state and federal law, does not alter the underlying
basis for the arrest and subsequent custody. As long as a
person is arrested and held only on state charges by state or
local authorities, the provisions of $ 3501(c) are not triggered.

3 As we observed in Mallory v. United States, 354 U. S. 449 (1957), Rule
5(a) is part of "[t]he scheme for initiating a federal prosecution." Id., at
454 (emphasis added).

Opinion of the Court
In this case, respondent was under arrest on state narcot-ics charges at the time he made his inculpatory statement to

the Secret Service agents. The terms of $ 3501(c) thus didnot come into play until respondent was arrested by the
agents on a federal charge--after he made the statement.Because respondent's statement was made voluntarily, as
the District Court found, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a, noth-ing in $ 3501 authorized its suppression. See 18 U. S. C.

$$ 3501(a), (d). The State's failure to arraign or prosecuterespondent does not alter this conclusion. Although Congress could have provided that the exercise of prosecutorialdiscretion by the State in this scenario retroactively transforms time spent in the custody of state or local officers intotime spent under "arrest or other detention" for purposes of

$ 3501(c), it did not do so in the statute as written. Cf. Ger-main, 503 U. S., at 253-254.

Although we think proper application of $ 3501(c) will beas straightforward in most cases as it is here, the parties
identify one presumably rare scenario that might presentsome potential for confusion; namely, the situation that
would arise if state or local authorities, acting in collusionwith federal officers, were to arrest and detain someone in
order to allow the federal agents to interrogate him in viola-tion of his right to a prompt federal presentment. Long before the enactment of $ 3501, we held that a confession ob-tained during such a period of detention must be suppressed
if the defendant could demonstrate the existence of impropercollaboration between federal and state or local officers.
See Anderson v. United States, 318 U. S. 350 (1943).4 In this

4 In Anderson, a local sheriff, acting without authority under state law,
arrested several men suspected of dynamiting federally owned power lines
during the course of a labor dispute and allowed them to be interrogated
for several days by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Only
after the suspects made confessions were they arrested by the federal
agents and arraigned before a United States Commissioner. We held the
confessions to be inadmissible as the "improperly" secured product of an
impermissible "working arrangement" between state and federal officers.

Opinion of the Court
case, however, we need not address $ 3501's effect, if any, on
the rule announced in Anderson. The District Court concluded that there was "no evidence" that a "collusive arrangement between state and federal agents . . . caused [respondent's] confession to be made," App. to Pet. for Cert.
50a, and we see no reason to disturb that factual finding. It
is true that the Sheriff 's Department informed the Secret
Service agents that counterfeit currency had been found in
respondent's possession, but such routine cooperation between local and federal authorities is, by itself, wholly unobjectionable: "Only by such an interchange of information can
society be adequately protected against crime." United
States v. Coppola, 281 F. 2d 340, 344 (CA2 1960) (en banc),
aff 'd, 365 U. S. 762 (1961). Cf. Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U. S.
121, 123 (1959).5

III

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

So ordered.

5 Respondent urges that the judgment below should be affirmed on an
alternative ground. Although he was initially arrested on state charges
on a Friday afternoon and held in local custody until Monday afternoon,
respondent was not brought before a magistrate during this period. In
County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44, 57 (1991), we held that
the Fourth Amendment generally requires a judicial determination of
probable cause within 48 hours of a warrantless arrest. Relying on McLaughlin and Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U. S. 103 (1975), respondent now asserts that his confession was obtained during an ongoing violation of his
Fourth Amendment right to a prompt determination of probable cause.
Respondent, however, did not raise a Fourth Amendment claim in the
District Court or the Court of Appeals; he argued for suppression based
only on the Fifth Amendment and $ 3501. Finding no exceptional circumstances that would warrant reviewing a claim that was waived below, we

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Blackmunjoins, concurring.

When Alvarez-Sanchez was arrested by the Los AngelesSheriff 's Department, 18 U. S. C. $ 3501(c) was not triggered.
As the Court explains, an arrest by state or local law en-forcement authorities on state criminal charges is not an "arrest or other detention" within the meaning of $ 3501(c), andthere is no evidence in this case of any "improper collaboration," ante, at 359, or "working arrangement," Anderson v.
United States, 318 U. S. 350, 356 (1943), between local andfederal authorities. See ante, at 357-360, and n. 4. I write

separately only to emphasize that we do not decide today aquestion on which the Courts of Appeals remain divided: the
effect of $ 3501(c) on confessions obtained more than six hoursafter an arrest on federal charges. See

ante, at 356, 359-360.*

Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment.
The Court holds that $ 3501(c) "does not apply to state-ments made by a person who is being held solely on state

charges." Ante, at 352. While I agree with the Court's an-swer to the narrow question the petition for certiorari presents,1 I write separately to emphasize the importance of thefactual premise underlying that answer.

*Compare, e. g., 975 F. 2d 1396, 1402-1403 (1992) (decision below), and
United States v. Perez, 733 F. 2d 1026, 1031 (CA2 1984) ("[$]3501 leaves
the McNabb-Mallory rule intact with regard to confessions obtained after
a six hour delay not found to be reasonable"); United States v. Robinson,
439 F. 2d 553, 563-564 (CADC 1970) (same), with United States v. Christopher, 956 F. 2d 536, 538-539 (CA6 1991) (under $ 3501, unnecessary delay
of more than six hours, "standing alone, is not sufficient to justify the
suppression of an otherwise voluntary confession"), cert. denied, 505 U. S.
1207 (1992); United States v. Beltran, 761 F. 2d 1, 8 (CA1 1985) (same).

1 The question presented is "Whether a confession given to federal authorities while a suspect is in state custody awaiting arraignment on state
charges must be suppressed as a result of delay between the suspect's
original arrest by state authorities and his eventual presentment on the
federal crime to which he confessed." Pet. for Cert. I.

362 UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ-SANCHEZ

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
As the case comes to us, it is undisputed that respondentconfessed while he was being held on state charges alone.

975 F. 2d 1396, 1398 (CA9 1992). Accepting that, the Courtof Appeals held that the confession nevertheless must be
suppressed because it read the phrase "detention in thecustody of any law-enforcement officer or law-enforcement
agency" in 18 U. S. C. $ 3501(c) to include custody solely onstate charges. 975 F. 2d, at 1405. The Court of Appeals
therefore had no occasion to consider whether the state po-lice officers' awareness of respondent's probable involvement
in two federal crimes 2 might indicate that the state charges
were not the sole basis for his detention.In its petition for certiorari the Government correctly advised us that "[r]eversal of the Ninth Circuit's erroneous con-clusion that the relevant arrest was effected by California
authorities will obviate the need to consider" additional issues. Pet. for Cert. 13. Accordingly, what sort of coopera-tion between federal and local authorities would remove a

case from the category in which the custody is decidedly onstate charges alone is a question not before us, and the Court
correctly declines to address the matter. Surely, however,cases in which cooperation between state and federal authorities requires compliance with the terms of $ 3501(c) are notmerely hypothetical examples of a "presumably rare scenario," ante, at 359. And I definitely would not assume that

$ 3501(c) will never "come into play" until a suspect is ar-rested on a federal charge.

Ibid.
The Court also has no reason to comment on the Dis-trict Court's finding that respondent's confession was not

the product of collusion between state and federal agents.

2 Los Angeles police officers took respondent into custody on a Friday.
975 F. 2d 1396, 1397-1398 (CA9 1992). At the time of arrest, those officers
discovered that respondent possessed two kinds of contraband--narcotics
and counterfeit money, id., at 1398--and they presumably realized that he
was guilty of at least two federal offenses as well as the state-law violation
for which he was arrested.

Ante, at 360. The Court of Appeals' construction of thestatute made review of that finding unnecessary. Thus

while the Court rightly declines to "disturb" the factualfinding, ibid., it should likewise stop short of suggesting that
anyone on this Court has determined that the finding iseither correct or incorrect.

For these reasons, I concur in the Court's judgment butdo not join its opinion.

IN RE ANDERSON
on motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis

No. 93-8312. Decided May 2, 1994
During the last three years alone, pro se petitioner Anderson has filed 22

separate petitions and motions, most for extraordinary writs. This
Court denied all of them without recorded dissent. He was also denied
leave to proceed in forma pauperis, pursuant to this Court's Rule 39.8,
on the last three occasions that he has submitted petitions for extraordinary relief.

Held: Anderson is denied leave to proceed in forma pauperis in the instant case, and the Clerk is instructed not to accept any further petitions
for extraordinary writs from him unless he pays the required docketing
fee and submits his petitions in compliance with Rule 33. For the reasons discussed in In re Demos, 500 U. S. 16, In re Sindram, 498 U. S.
177, and In re McDonald, 489 U. S. 180, the Court feels compelled to
enter this order, which will allow it to devote its limited resources to
the claims of petitioners who have not abused the Court's process.

Motion denied.

Per Curiam.
Pro se petitioner Grant Anderson seeks an extraordinarywrit pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2241 and requests permission

to proceed in forma pauperis under this Court's Rule 39.Pursuant to Rule 39.8, we deny petitioner leave to proceed in
forma pauperis.* Petitioner is allowed until May 23, 1994,within which to pay the docketing fee required by Rule 38
and to submit his petition in compliance with this Court'sRule 33. For the reasons explained below, we also direct
the Clerk of the Court not to accept any further petitionsfor extraordinary writs from petitioner unless he pays the
docketing fee required by Rule 38 and submits his petitionsin compliance with Rule 33.

*This Court's Rule 39.8 provides: "If satisfied that a petition for a writ
of certiorari, jurisdictional statement, or petition for an extraordinary
writ, as the case may be, is frivolous or malicious, the Court may deny a
motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis."

Petitioner is a prolific filer in this Court. In the last threeyears alone, he has filed 22 separate petitions and motions,

including 3 petitions for certiorari, 6 motions for reconsidera-tion, and 13 petitions for extraordinary writs. Thirteen of
these petitions and motions have been filed this Term. Wehave denied all of the petitions and motions without recorded
dissent. We have also denied petitioner leave to proceed
in forma pauperis, pursuant to Rule 39.8, on the last threeoccasions that he has submitted petitions for extraordinary

relief.Like the majority of his previous submissions to this
Court, the instant petition for habeas corpus relates to thedenial of petitioner's various postconviction motions by the
District of Columbia Court of Appeals. The current petitionmerely repeats arguments that we have considered previously and not found worthy of plenary review. Like thethree petitions in which we denied petitioner leave to proceed in forma pauperis, moreover, the instant petition ispatently frivolous.

The bulk of petitioner's submissions have been petitionsfor extraordinary writs, and we limit our sanction accordingly. We have imposed similar sanctions in three priorcases. See In re Demos, 500 U. S. 16 (1991); In re Sindram,
498 U. S. 177 (1991); In re McDonald, 489 U. S. 180 (1989).For the reasons discussed in these cases, we feel compelled
to bar petitioner from filing any further requests for extraor-dinary relief. As we concluded in

Sindram:

"The goal of fairly dispensing justice . . . is compromisedwhen the Court is forced to devote its limited resources

to the processing of repetitious and frivolous requests.
Pro se petitioners have a greater capacity than most todisrupt the fair allocation of judicial resources because

they are not subject to the financial considerations--fil-ing fees and attorney's fees--that deter other litigants
from filing frivolous petitions. The risks of abuse areparticularly acute with respect to applications for ex511us2$45Z 07-02-96 23:34:09 PAGES OPINPGT

any time without limitation. In order to prevent frivo-lous petitions for extraordinary relief from unsettling
the fair administration of justice, the Court has a dutyto deny

So long as petitioner qualifies under this Court's Rule 39and does not similarly abuse the privilege, he remains free

to file in forma pauperis requests for relief other than anextraordinary writ. See

resources to the claims of petitioners who have not abusedour process." In re Sassower, 510 U. S. 4, 6 (1993).

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Blackmun joins,dissenting.

During my years of service on the Court, I have not de-tected any threat to the integrity of its processes, or its ability to administer justice fairly, caused by frivolous petitions,whether filed by paupers or by affluent litigants. Three
years ago I expressed the opinion that the cost of adminis-tering sanctions such as that imposed on this petitioner

would exceed any perceptible administrative benefit. In re
Amendment to Rule 39, 500 U. S. 13, 15 (1991). Any mini-mal savings in time or photocopying costs, it seemed to me,

did not justify the damage that occasional orders denying informa pauperis status would cause to "the symbolic interest
in preserving equal access to the Court for both the richand the poor."

Ibid. Three years' experience under thisCourt's Rule 39.8 leaves me convinced that the dissenters in

the cases the Court cites had it right. See In re Demos, 500U. S. 16, 17-19 (1991); In re Sindram, 498 U. S. 177, 180-183

BEECHAM v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 93-445. Argued March 21, 1994--Decided May 16, 1994*
Petitioners Beecham and Jones were each convicted of violating 18 U. S. C.

$ 922(g), which makes it unlawful for a convicted felon to possess a firearm. Title 18 U. S. C. $ 921(a)(20) qualifies the definition of "conviction": "What constitutes a conviction [is] determined in accordance with
the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held," ibid.
(choice-of-law clause), and "[a]ny conviction which has been expunged,
or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil
rights restored shall not be considered a conviction . . . ," ibid. (exemption clause). The respective District Courts decided that Beecham's
and Jones' prior federal convictions could not be counted because petitioners' civil rights had been restored under state law. The Court of
Appeals reversed, holding that state restoration of civil rights could not
undo the federal disability flowing from a federal conviction.

Held: Petitioners can take advantage of $ 921(a)(20) only if their civil rights

have been restored under federal law, the law of the jurisdiction where
the earlier proceedings were held. The choice-of-law clause is logically
read to apply to the exemption clause. The inquiry throughout the
statutory scheme is whether the person has a qualifying conviction on
his record. The choice-of-law clause defines the rule for determining
what constitutes a conviction. Asking, under the exemption clause,
whether a person's civil rights have been restored is just one step in
determining whether something should "be considered a conviction," a
determination that, by the terms of the choice-of-law clause, is governed
by the law of the convicting jurisdiction. That the other three items
listed in the exemption clause are either always or almost always done
by the jurisdiction of conviction also counsels in favor of interpreting
civil rights restoration as possessing the same attribute. This statutory structure rebuts the arguments used by other Circuits to support
their conclusion that the two clauses should be read separately. Moreover, even if there is no federal law procedure for restoring civil rights
to federal felons, nothing in $ 921(a)(20) supports the assumption that

Opinion of the Court
Congress intended all felons to have access to all the procedures specified in the exemption clause, especially because there are many States
that do not restore civil rights, either. Because the statutory language
is unambiguous, the rule of lenity is inapplicable. See Chapman v.
United States, 500 U. S. 453, 463-464. Pp. 370-374.

993 F. 2d 1539 (first case) and 993 F. 2d 1131 (second case), affirmed.

O'Connor, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

Nathan Lewin argued the cause for petitioners. Withhim on the briefs were

Mathew S. Nosanchuk and R. Rus-sell Stobbs.

Edward C. DuMont argued the cause for the UnitedStates. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Days,
Assistant Attorney General Harris, Deputy Solicitor Gen-eral Bryson, and John F. De Pue.

Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
Today we construe three provisions of the federal fire-arms statutes:

"It shall be unlawful for any person who has been convicted . . . [of] a crime punishable by imprisonment fora term exceeding one year . . . [to possess] any

firearm . . . ." 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g)."What constitutes a conviction . . . shall be determined
in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in whichthe proceedings were held." $ 921(a)(20) (the choice-oflaw clause)."Any conviction which has been expunged, or set aside
or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil
rights restored shall not be considered a conviction . . . ."
Ibid. (the exemption clause).

The question before us is which jurisdiction's law is to be
considered in determining whether a felon "has had civilrights restored" for a prior federal conviction.

370 BEECHAM v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court

I
Each of the petitioners was convicted of violating $ 922(g).Beecham was convicted in Federal District Court in North

Carolina, Jones in Federal District Court in West Virginia.Beecham's relevant prior conviction was a 1979 federal conviction in Tennessee, for violating 18 U. S. C. $ 922(h). App.11. Jones' prior convictions were two West Virginia state
convictions, for breaking and entering and for forgery, andone 1971 federal conviction in Ohio for interstate transportation of a stolen automobile. Id., at 19-20.Jones had gotten his civil rights restored by West Virginia,
so his two West Virginia state convictions were not consid-ered. Beecham claimed his civil rights had been restored
by Tennessee, the State in which he had been convicted ofhis federal offense. The question presented to the District
Courts was whether these restorations of civil rights by
States could remove the disabilities imposed as a result ofBeecham's and Jones' federal convictions.

In both cases, the District Courts concluded the answerwas "yes," though for different reasons: In Beecham's case
the court looked to the law of the State in which the earlierfederal crime was committed (Tennessee); in Jones' case the
court looked to the law of the State in which Jones livedwhen he committed the $ 922(g) offense (West Virginia).
The Fourth Circuit reversed both rulings, reasoning thatstate restoration of civil rights could not undo the federal
disability flowing from a federal conviction. See 993 F. 2d1131 (1993) (Jones' case) and 993 F. 2d 1539 (1993) ( judgt.
order in Beecham's case). We granted certiorari to resolvethe conflict this decision created with United States v. Edwards, 946 F. 2d 1347 (CA8 1991), and United States v.Geyler, 932 F. 2d 1330 (CA9 1991). 510 U. S. 975 (1993).

II
The question in these cases is how the choice-of-law clauseand the exemption clause of $ 921(a)(20) are related. If, as

511us2$46J 11-03-97 18:44:51 PAGES OPINPGT

371Cite as: 511 U. S. 368 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
the Fourth Circuit held, the choice-of-law clause applies tothe exemption clause, then we must look to whether Beecham's and Jones' civil rights were restored under federal law(the law of the jurisdiction in which the earlier proceedings
were held). On the other hand, if, as the Eighth and Ninth
Circuits concluded, the two clauses ought to be read sepa-rately, see

Geyler, supra, at 1334-1335; Edwards, supra, at
1349-1350, then we would have to come up with a specialchoice-of-law principle for the exemption clause.

We think the Fourth Circuit's reading is the better one.Throughout the statutory scheme, the inquiry is: Does the
person have a qualifying conviction on his record? Section
922(g) imposes a disability on people who "ha[ve] been convicted." The choice-of-law clause defines the rule for determining "[w]hat constitutes a conviction." The exemption
clause says that a conviction for which a person has had civil
rights restored "shall not be considered a conviction." Asking whether a person has had civil rights restored is thus
just one step in determining whether something should "be
considered a conviction." By the terms of the choice-of-law
clause, this determination is governed by the law of the convicting jurisdiction.

This interpretation is supported by the fact that the other
three procedures listed in the exemption clause--pardons,
expungements, and set-asides--are either always or almost
always (depending on whether one considers a federal grant
of habeas corpus to be a "set-aside," a question we do not
now decide) done by the jurisdiction of conviction. That
several items in a list share an attribute counsels in favor of
interpreting the other items as possessing that attribute as
well. Dole v. Steelworkers, 494 U. S. 26, 36 (1990); Third
Nat. Bank in Nashville v. Impac Limited, Inc., 432 U. S. 312,
322 (1977); Jarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307
(1961). Though this canon of construction is by no means a
hard and fast rule, it is a factor pointing toward the Fourth
Circuit's construction of the statute.

511us2$46J 11-03-97 18:44:51 PAGES OPINPGT
372 BEECHAM v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
In light of the statutory structure, the fact that both
clauses speak of "conviction[s]" rebuts the Eighth and Ninth
Circuits' argument that the two clauses "pertain to two entirely different sets of circumstances"--"the question of
what constitutes a conviction" and "the effect of postconviction events." Geyler, supra, at 1334-1335; see also
Edwards, supra, at 1349. The exemption clause does not
simply say that a person whose civil rights have been restored is exempted from $ 922(g)'s firearms disqualification.
It says that the person's conviction "shall not be considered
a conviction." The effect of postconviction events is therefore, under the statutory scheme, just one element of the
question of what constitutes a conviction.

Likewise, the presence of the choice-of-law clause rebuts
the Eighth and Ninth Circuits' argument that the "plain, unlimited language," Edwards, supra, at 1349; see also Geyler,
supra, at 1334, of the exemption clause--with its reference
to "[a]ny conviction . . . for which a person has . . . had civil
rights restored" (emphasis added)--refers to all civil rights
restorations, even those by a jurisdiction other than the one
in which the conviction was entered. Regardless of what
the quoted phrase might mean standing alone, in conjunction
with the choice-of-law clause it must refer only to restorations of civil rights by the convicting jurisdiction. The plain
meaning that we seek to discern is the plain meaning of the
whole statute, not of isolated sentences. See King v. St.
Vincent's Hospital, 502 U. S. 215, 221 (1991); Massachusetts
v. Morash, 490 U. S. 107, 115 (1989); Shell Oil Co. v. Iowa
Dept. of Revenue, 488 U. S. 19, 26 (1988).

We are also unpersuaded by the Ninth Circuit's argument
that "[b]ecause there is no federal procedure for restoring
civil rights to a federal felon, Congress could not have expected that the federal government would perform this function," and that therefore "[t]he reference in $ 921(a)(20) to the
restoration of civil rights must be to the state procedure."

511us2$46J 11-03-97 18:44:51 PAGES OPINPGT

373Cite as: 511 U. S. 368 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
Geyler, 932 F. 2d, at 1333.* This reasoning assumes that
Congress intended felons convicted by all jurisdictions to
have access to all the procedures (pardon, expungement,
set-aside, and civil rights restoration) specified in the exemption clause; but nothing in $ 921(a)(20) supports the assumption on which this reasoning is based. Many jurisdictions
have no procedure for restoring civil rights. See Apps. A
and B to Brief for Petitioners (indicating that at least 11
States--Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri,
New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Vermont, and
Virginia suspend felons' civil rights but provide no procedure
for restoring them); see, e. g., Mo. Rev. Stat. $ 561.026 (1979
and Supp. 1994); United States v. Thomas, 991 F. 2d 206,
213-214 (CA5) (Texas law), cert. denied, 510 U. S. 1014
(1993). However one reads the statutory scheme--as looking to the law of the convicting jurisdiction, or to the law of
the State in which the prior conduct took place, or to the law
of the State in which the felon now lives or has at one time
lived--people in some jurisdictions would have options open
to them that people in other jurisdictions may lack. Under
our reading of the statute, a person convicted in federal court
is no worse off than a person convicted in a court of a State
that does not restore civil rights.

*We express no opinion on whether a federal felon cannot have his civil
rights restored under federal law. This is a complicated question, one
which involves the interpretation of the federal law relating to federal
civil rights, see U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 2, cl. 1 (right to vote for Representatives); U. S. Const., Amdt. XVII (right to vote for Senators); 28 U. S. C.

$ 1865 (right to serve on a jury); consideration of the possible relevance of
18 U. S. C. $ 925(c) (1988 ed., Supp. IV), which allows the Secretary of the
Treasury to grant relief from the disability imposed by $ 922(g); and the
determination whether civil rights must be restored by an affirmative act
of a Government official, see United States v. Ramos, 961 F. 2d 1003, 1008
(CA1), cert. denied, 506 U. S. 934 (1992), or whether they may be restored
automatically by operation of law, see United States v. Hall, 20 F. 3d 1066
(CA10 1994). We do not address these matters today.

511us2$46J 11-03-97 18:44:51 PAGES OPINPGT
374 BEECHAM v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Because the statutory language is unambiguous, the ruleof lenity, which petitioners urge us to employ here, is inapplicable. See Chapman v. United States, 500 U. S. 453, 463-464 (1991). Of course, by denying the existence of an ambiguity, we do not claim to be perfectly certain that we havedivined Congress' intentions as to this particular situation.
It is possible that the phrases on which our reading of thestatute turns--"[w]hat constitutes a conviction" and "shall
not be considered a conviction"--were accidents of statutorydrafting; it is possible that some legislators thought the two
sentences of $ 921(a)(20) should be read separately, or, morelikely, that they never considered the matter at all. And we
recognize that in enacting the choice-of-law clause, legisla-tors may have been simply responding to our decision in
Dickerson v. New Banner Institute, Inc., 460 U. S. 103(1983), which held that federal law rather than state law
controls the definition of what constitutes a conviction, notsetting forth a choice-of-law principle for the restoration of
civil rights following a conviction.But our task is not the hopeless one of ascertaining what
the legislators who passed the law would have decided hadthey reconvened to consider petitioners' particular cases.
Rather, it is to determine whether the language the legisla-tors actually enacted has a plain, unambiguous meaning. In
this instance, we believe it does.

III
We therefore conclude that petitioners can take advantageof $ 921(a)(20) only if they have had their civil rights restored

under federal law, and accordingly affirm the judgment ofthe Court of Appeals.

So ordered.

KOKKONEN v. GUARDIAN LIFE INSURANCECOMPANY OF AMERICA
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 93-263. Argued March 1, 1994--Decided May 16, 1994
Following respondent's termination of an agency agreement between the

parties, petitioner brought a state-court suit alleging state-law claims.
Respondent removed the case to the Federal District Court on diversity
grounds and filed state-law counterclaims. The parties subsequently
arrived at a settlement agreement and, pursuant to Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(ii), executed a Stipulation and Order of Dismissal with Prejudice, which did not refer to the settlement agreement
or reserve District Court jurisdiction to enforce it. After the District
Judge signed the Stipulation and Order, a dispute arose as to petitioner's obligations under the settlement agreement. Respondent filed a
motion to enforce the agreement, which petitioner opposed on the
ground, inter alia, that the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction.
The District Court entered an enforcement order, asserting that it had
"inherent power" to do so. The Court of Appeals agreed and affirmed.

Held: A federal district court, possessing only that power authorized by

Constitution and statute, lacks jurisdiction over a claim for breach of a
contract, part of the consideration for which was dismissal of an earlier
federal suit. No federal statute makes that connection (if it constitutionally could) the basis for federal-court jurisdiction over the contract
dispute. Moreover, the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction does not apply,
since the facts to be determined with regard to the alleged breach of
contract are quite separate from the facts to be determined in the principal suit, and automatic jurisdiction over such contracts is in no way
essential to the conduct of federal-court business. Julian v. Central
Trust Co., 193 U. S. 93, 113-114, distinguished. If the parties wish to
provide for the court's jurisdiction to enforce a dismissal-producing settlement agreement, they can seek to do so. In the event of dismissal
pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2), the court may, in
its discretion, make the parties' compliance with the terms of the settlement agreement (or retention of jurisdiction over the agreement) part
of its order. When dismissal occurs pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(ii), the
district court is empowered (with the consent of the parties) to incorporate the settlement agreement in the order or retain jurisdiction over
the settlement contract itself. Absent such action, however, enforce511us2$47Z 11-03-97 18:48:27 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
Stipulation and Order of Dismissal with Prejudice, dismiss-ing the complaint and cross-complaint. On April 13, the District Judge signed the Stipulation and Order under the nota-tion "It is so ordered." The Stipulation and Order did not
reserve jurisdiction in the District Court to enforce the settlement agreement; indeed, it did not so much as refer to thesettlement agreement.

Thereafter the parties disagreed on petitioner's obligationto return certain files to respondent under the settlement
agreement. On May 21, respondent moved in the DistrictCourt to enforce the agreement, which petitioner opposed on
the ground, inter alia, that the court lacked subject-matter
jurisdiction. The District Court entered an enforcement
order, asserting an "inherent power" to do so. Order Enforcing Settlement (ED Cal., Aug. 19, 1992), App. 180. Petitioner appealed, relying solely on his jurisdictional objection.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
affirmed, quoting its opinion in Wilkinson v. FBI, 922 F. 2d
555, 557 (1991), to the effect that after dismissal of an action
pursuant to a settlement agreement, a " `district court ha[s]
jurisdiction to decide the [enforcement] motion[] under its
inherent supervisory power.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. A-5

Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. They
possess only that power authorized by Constitution and statute, see Willy v. Coastal Corp., 503 U. S. 131, 136-137 (1992);
Bender v. Williamsport Area School Dist., 475 U. S. 534, 541
(1986), which is not to be expanded by judicial decree, American Fire & Casualty Co. v. Finn, 341 U. S. 6 (1951). It is
to be presumed that a cause lies outside this limited jurisdiction, Turner v. Bank of North-America, 4 Dall. 8, 11 (1799),
and the burden of establishing the contrary rests upon the
party asserting jurisdiction, McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 298 U. S. 178, 182-183 (1936).

378 KOKKONEN v. GUARDIAN LIFE INS. CO. OF AMERICA

Opinion of the Court
The dismissal in this case issued pursuant to Federal Ruleof Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(ii), which provides for dismissal

"by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties whohave appeared in the action," and causes that dismissal to be
with prejudice if (as here) the stipulation so specifies. Nei-ther the Rule nor any provision of law provides for jurisdiction of the court over disputes arising out of an agreementthat produces the stipulation. It must be emphasized that
what respondent seeks in this case is enforcement of the set-tlement agreement, and not merely reopening of the dismissed suit by reason of breach of the agreement that wasthe basis for dismissal. Some Courts of Appeals have held
that the latter can be obtained under Federal Rule of CivilProcedure 60(b)(6).

2 See, e. g., Keeling v. Sheet Metal Workers Int'l Assn., 937 F. 2d 408, 410 (CA9 1991); Fairfax Countywide Citizens Assn. v. Fairfax County, 571 F. 2d 1299,1302-1303 (CA4 1978). But see

Sawka v. Healtheast, Inc.,989 F. 2d 138, 140-141 (CA3 1993) (breach of settlement

agreement insufficient reason to set dismissal aside on Rule60(b)(6) grounds); Harman v. Pauley, 678 F. 2d 479, 480-481
(CA4 1982) (Rule 60(b)(6) does not require vacating dismissalorder whenever a settlement agreement has been breached).
Enforcement of the settlement agreement, however, whetherthrough award of damages or decree of specific performance,
is more than just a continuation or renewal of the dismissedsuit, and hence requires its own basis for jurisdiction.

Respondent relies upon the doctrine of ancillary jurisdic-tion, which recognizes federal courts' jurisdiction over some
matters (otherwise beyond their competence) that are inci-dental to other matters properly before them. Respondent
appeals to our statement (quoting a then-current treatise on

2 The relevant provision of that Rule reads as follows:
"On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party
or a party's legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: . . . (6) any other reason justifying relief
from the operation of the judgment."

Opinion of the Court
equity) in Julian v. Central Trust Co., 193 U. S. 93 (1904): "Abill filed to continue a former litigation in the same court . . .

to obtain and secure the fruits, benefits and advantages ofthe proceedings and judgment in a former suit in the same
court by the same or additional parties . . . or to obtain any
equitable relief in regard to, or connected with, or growingout of, any judgment or proceeding at law rendered in the

same court, . . . is an ancillary suit." Id., at 113-114 (citing1 C. Bates, Federal Equity Procedure $ 97 (1901)).

The doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction can hardly be criti-cized for being overly rigid or precise, but we think it does
not stretch so far as that statement suggests. The expansive language of Julian can be countered by (equally inaccurate) dicta in later cases that provide an excessively limited
description of the doctrine. See, e. g., Fulton Nat. Bank of
Atlanta v. Hozier, 267 U. S. 276, 280 (1925) ("[N]o controversy can be regarded as dependent or ancillary unless it has
direct relation to property or assets actually or constructively drawn into the court's possession or control by the
principal suit"). The holding of Julian was not remotely as

permissive as its language: Jurisdiction was based upon the
fact that the court, in a prior decree of foreclosure, had expressly reserved jurisdiction to adjudicate claims against the
judicially conveyed property, and to retake and resell the
property if claims it found valid were not paid. 193 U. S.,
at 109-112.

It is to the holdings of our cases, rather than their dicta,
that we must attend, and we find none of them that has, for
purposes of asserting otherwise nonexistent federal jurisdiction, relied upon a relationship so tenuous as the breach of
an agreement that produced the dismissal of an earlier federal suit. Generally speaking, we have asserted ancillary
jurisdiction (in the very broad sense in which that term is
sometimes used) for two separate, though sometimes related,
purposes: (1) to permit disposition by a single court of claims
that are, in varying respects and degrees, factually interde511us2$47K 11-03-97 18:48:27 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
pendent, see, e. g., Baker v. Gold Seal Liquors, Inc., 417 U. S.467, 469, n. 1 (1974);

Moore v. New York Cotton Exchange,
270 U. S. 593, 610 (1926); and (2) to enable a court to functionsuccessfully, that is, to manage its proceedings, vindicate its

authority, and effectuate its decrees, see, e. g., Chambers v.
NASCO, Inc., 501 U. S. 32 (1991) (power to compel paymentof opposing party's attorney's fees as sanction for misconduct); United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32, 34 (1812) (con-tempt power to maintain order during proceedings). See
generally 13 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Prac-tice and Procedure $ 3523 (1984); cf. 28 U. S. C. $ 1367 (1988
ed., Supp. IV).

Neither of these heads supports the present assertion of
jurisdiction. As to the first, the facts underlying respondent's dismissed claim for breach of agency agreement and
those underlying its claim for breach of settlement agreement have nothing to do with each other; it would neither
be necessary nor even particularly efficient that they be adjudicated together. No case of ours asserts, nor do we think
the concept of limited federal jurisdiction permits us to assert, ancillary jurisdiction over any agreement that has as
part of its consideration the dismissal of a case before a federal court.

But it is the second head of ancillary jurisdiction, relating
to the court's power to protect its proceedings and vindicate
its authority, that both courts in the present case appear to
have relied upon, judging from their references to "inherent
power," see App. to Pet. for Cert. A-2 and A-5; App. 180.
We think, however, that the power asked for here is quite
remote from what courts require in order to perform their
functions. We have recognized inherent authority to appoint counsel to investigate and prosecute violation of a
court's order. Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils
S. A., 481 U. S. 787 (1987). But the only order here was that
the suit be dismissed, a disposition that is in no way flouted
or imperiled by the alleged breach of the settlement agree511us2$47K 11-03-97 18:48:27 PAGES OPINPGT

381Cite as: 511 U. S. 375 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
ment. The situation would be quite different if the parties'obligation to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement had been made part of the order of dismissal--eitherby separate provision (such as a provision "retaining jurisdiction" over the settlement agreement) or by incorporating
the terms of the settlement agreement in the order. In thatevent, a breach of the agreement would be a violation of the

order, and ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the agreementwould therefore exist. That, however, was not the case
here. The judge's mere awareness and approval of theterms of the settlement agreement do not suffice to make
them part of his order.

The short of the matter is this: The suit involves a claim
for breach of a contract, part of the consideration for which
was dismissal of an earlier federal suit. No federal statute
makes that connection (if it constitutionally could) the basis
for federal-court jurisdiction over the contract dispute. The
facts to be determined with regard to such alleged breaches
of contract are quite separate from the facts to be determined in the principal suit, and automatic jurisdiction over
such contracts is in no way essential to the conduct of
federal-court business. If the parties wish to provide for
the court's enforcement of a dismissal-producing settlement
agreement, they can seek to do so. When the dismissal is
pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2), which
specifies that the action "shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff 's instance save upon order of the court and upon such
terms and conditions as the court deems proper," the parties'
compliance with the terms of the settlement contract (or the
court's "retention of jurisdiction" over the settlement contract) may, in the court's discretion, be one of the terms set
forth in the order. Even when, as occurred here, the dismissal is pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(ii) (which does not by its
terms empower a district court to attach conditions to the
parties' stipulation of dismissal) we think the court is authorized to embody the settlement contract in its dismissal order

(or, what has the same effect, retain jurisdiction over thesettlement contract) if the parties agree. Absent such action, however, enforcement of the settlement agreement isfor state courts, unless there is some independent basis for

Syllabus

C & A CARBONE, INC., et al. v. TOWN OFCLARKSTOWN, NEW YORK
certiorari to the appellate division, supreme courtof new york, second judicial department

No. 92-1402. Argued December 7, 1993--Decided May 16, 1994
Respondent town agreed to allow a private contractor to construct within

town limits a solid waste transfer station to separate recyclable from
nonrecyclable items and to operate the facility for five years, at which
time the town would buy it for one dollar. To finance the transfer station's cost, the town guaranteed a minimum waste flow to the facility,
for which the contractor could charge the hauler a tipping fee which
exceeded the disposal cost of unsorted solid waste on the private market. In order to meet the waste flow guarantee, the town adopted a
flow control ordinance, requiring all nonhazardous solid waste within
the town to be deposited at the transfer station. While recyclers like
petitioners (collectively Carbone) may receive solid waste at their own
sorting facilities, the ordinance requires them to bring nonrecyclable
residue to the transfer station, thus forbidding them to ship such waste
themselves and requiring them to pay the tipping fee on trash that has
already been sorted. After discovering that Carbone was shipping
nonrecyclable waste to out-of-state destinations, the town filed suit in
state court, seeking an injunction requiring that this residue be shipped
to the transfer station. The court granted summary judgment to the
town, finding the ordinance constitutional, and the Appellate Division
affirmed.

Held: The flow control ordinance violates the Commerce Clause.

Pp. 389-395.

(a) The ordinance regulates interstate commerce. While its immediate effect is to direct local transport of solid waste to a designated site
within the local jurisdiction, its economic effects are interstate in reach.
By requiring Carbone to send the nonrecyclable portion of waste it receives from out of State to the transfer station at an additional cost, the
ordinance drives up the cost for out-of-state interests to dispose of their
solid waste. It also deprives out-of-state businesses of access to the
local market, by preventing everyone except the favored local operator
from performing the initial processing step. P. 389.

(b) The ordinance discriminates against interstate commerce, and
thus is invalid. See Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 624.
Although the ordinance erects no barrier to the import or export of any

511us2$48z 11-08-97 20:01:04 PAGES OPINPGT
384 C & A CARBONE, INC. v. CLARKSTOWN

Syllabus
solid waste, the article of commerce here is not so much the waste itself,
but rather the service of processing and disposing of it. With respect
to this stream of commerce, the ordinance discriminates, for it allows
only the favored operator to process waste that is within the town's
limits. It is no less discriminatory because in-state or in-town processors are also covered by the prohibition. Cf., e. g., Dean Milk Co. v.
Madison, 340 U. S. 349. Favoring a single local proprietor makes the
ordinance's protectionist effect even more acute, for it squelches competition in the waste-processing service altogether, leaving no room for
outside investment. Pp. 389-392.

(c) The town does not lack other means to advance a legitimate local
interest. It could address alleged health and safety problems through
nondiscriminatory alternatives, such as uniform safety regulations that
would ensure that competitors do not underprice the market by cutting
corners on environmental safety. Justifying the ordinance as a way to
steer solid waste away from out-of-town disposal sites that the town
might deem harmful to the environment would extend its police power
beyond its jurisdictional boundaries. Moreover, the ordinance's revenue generating purpose by itself is not a local interest that can justify
discrimination against interstate commerce. If special financing is
needed to ensure the transfer station's long-term survival, the town may
subsidize the facility through general taxes or municipal bonds, but it
may not employ discriminatory regulation to give the project an advantage over rival out-of-state businesses. Pp. 392-395.

Opinion of the Court
are expending significant resources to develop trash controlsystems that are efficient, lawful, and protective of the environment. The difficulty of their task is evident from thenumber of recent cases that we have heard involving waste
transfer and treatment. See Philadelphia v. New Jersey,437 U. S. 617 (1978);

Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v.Hunt, 504 U. S. 334 (1992); Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill,

Inc. v. Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, 504 U. S. 353(1992); Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of Environmental Quality of Ore., ante, p. 93. The case decidedtoday, while perhaps a small new chapter in that course of
decisions, rests nevertheless upon well-settled principles ofour Commerce Clause jurisprudence.

We consider a so-called flow control ordinance, which re-quires all solid waste to be processed at a designated transfer station before leaving the municipality. The avowedpurpose of the ordinance is to retain the processing fees
charged at the transfer station to amortize the cost of thefacility. Because it attains this goal by depriving competitors, including out-of-state firms, of access to a local market,we hold that the flow control ordinance violates the Commerce Clause.The town of Clarkstown, New York, lies in the lower Hudson River Valley, just upstream from the Tappan Zee Bridgeand by highway minutes from New Jersey.

limits are the village of Nyack and the hamlet of WestNyack. In August 1989, Clarkstown entered into a consent

Opinion of the Court
decree with the New York State Department of Environmen-tal Conservation. The town agreed to close its landfill located on Route 303 in West Nyack and build a new solidwaste transfer station on the same site. The station would
receive bulk solid waste and separate recyclable from nonrecyclable items. Recyclable waste would be baled for ship-ment to a recycling facility; nonrecyclable waste, to a suitable

landfill or incinerator.The cost of building the transfer station was estimated at
$1.4 million. A local private contractor agreed to constructthe facility and operate it for five years, after which the town
would buy it for $1. During those five years, the town guaranteed a minimum waste flow of 120,000 tons per year, for
which the contractor could charge the hauler a so-called tipping fee of $81 per ton. If the station received less than
120,000 tons in a year, the town promised to make up the
tipping fee deficit. The object of this arrangement was to
amortize the cost of the transfer station: The town would
finance its new facility with the income generated by the
tipping fees.

The problem, of course, was how to meet the yearly guarantee. This difficulty was compounded by the fact that the
tipping fee of $81 per ton exceeded the disposal cost of unsorted solid waste on the private market. The solution the
town adopted was the flow control ordinance here in question, Local Laws 1990, No. 9 of the Town of Clarkstown (full
text in Appendix). The ordinance requires all nonhazardous
solid waste within the town to be deposited at the Route
303 transfer station. Id., $ 3.C (waste generated within the
town), $ 5.A (waste generated outside and brought in). Noncompliance is punishable by as much as a $1,000 fine and up
to 15 days in jail. $ 7.

The petitioners in this case are C & A Carbone, Inc., a
company engaged in the processing of solid waste, and various related companies or persons, all of whom we designate
Carbone. Carbone operates a recycling center in Clarks511us2$48L 11-08-97 20:01:04 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
town, where it receives bulk solid waste, sorts and balesit, and then ships it to other processing facilities--much as

occurs at the town's new transfer station. While the flowcontrol ordinance permits recyclers like Carbone to continue
receiving solid waste, $ 3.C, it requires them to bring the
nonrecyclable residue from that waste to the Route 303station. It thus forbids Carbone to ship the nonrecyclable

waste itself, and it requires Carbone to pay a tipping fee ontrash that Carbone has already sorted.

In March 1991, a tractor-trailer containing 23 bales ofsolid waste struck an overpass on the Palisades Interstate
Parkway. When the police investigated the accident, they
discovered the truck was carrying household waste from
Carbone's Clarkstown plant to an Indiana landfill. The
Clarkstown police put Carbone's plant under surveillance
and in the next few days seized six more tractor-trailers
leaving the facility. The trucks also contained nonrecyclable
waste, originating both within and without the town, and
destined for disposal sites in Illinois, Indiana, West Virginia,
and Florida.

The town of Clarkstown sued Carbone in New York
Supreme Court, Rockland County, seeking an injunction
requiring Carbone to ship all nonrecyclable waste to the
Route 303 transfer station. Carbone responded by suing
in United States District Court to enjoin the flow control
ordinance. On July 11, the federal court granted Carbone's
injunction, finding a sufficient likelihood that the ordinance
violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. C. & A. Carbone, Inc. v. Clarkstown, 770 F. Supp. 848
(SDNY 1991).

Four days later, the New York court granted summary
judgment to respondent. The court declared the flow control ordinance constitutional and enjoined Carbone to comply
with it. The federal court then dissolved its injunction.

The Appellate Division affirmed. 182 App. Div. 2d 213,
587 N. Y. S. 2d 681 (2d Dept. 1992). The court found that the

Opinion of the Court
ordinance did not discriminate against interstate commercebecause it "applies evenhandedly to all solid waste processed

within the Town, regardless of point of origin." Id., at 222,587 N. Y. S. 2d, at 686. The New York Court of Appeals
denied Carbone's motion for leave to appeal. 80 N. Y. 2d
760, 605 N. E. 2d 874 (1992). We granted certiorari, 508U. S. 938 (1993), and now reverse.

At the outset we confirm that the flow control ordinancedoes regulate interstate commerce, despite the town's position to the contrary. The town says that its ordinancereaches only waste within its jurisdiction and is in practical
effect a quarantine: It prevents garbage from entering the
stream of interstate commerce until it is made safe. This
reasoning is premised, however, on an outdated and mistaken
concept of what constitutes interstate commerce.

While the immediate effect of the ordinance is to direct
local transport of solid waste to a designated site within the
local jurisdiction, its economic effects are interstate in reach.
The Carbone facility in Clarkstown receives and processes
waste from places other than Clarkstown, including from out
of State. By requiring Carbone to send the nonrecyclable
portion of this waste to the Route 303 transfer station at an
additional cost, the flow control ordinance drives up the cost
for out-of-state interests to dispose of their solid waste.
Furthermore, even as to waste originant in Clarkstown, the
ordinance prevents everyone except the favored local operator from performing the initial processing step. The ordinance thus deprives out-of-state businesses of access to a
local market. These economic effects are more than enough
to bring the Clarkstown ordinance within the purview of the
Commerce Clause. It is well settled that actions are within
the domain of the Commerce Clause if they burden interstate
commerce or impede its free flow. NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1, 31 (1937).

The real question is whether the flow control ordinance is
valid despite its undoubted effect on interstate commerce.

390 C & A CARBONE, INC. v. CLARKSTOWN

Opinion of the Court
For this inquiry, our case law yields two lines of analysis:first, whether the ordinance discriminates against interstate

commerce, Philadelphia, 437 U. S., at 624; and second,whether the ordinance imposes a burden on interstate commerce that is "clearly excessive in relation to the putative
local benefits," Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 142(1970). As we find that the ordinance discriminates against

interstate commerce, we need not resort to the Pike test.The central rationale for the rule against discrimination is
to prohibit state or municipal laws whose object is local eco-nomic protectionism, laws that would excite those jealousies
and retaliatory measures the Constitution was designed to
prevent. See The Federalist No. 22, pp. 143-145 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton); Madison, Vices of the Political
System of the United States, in 2 Writings of James Madison
362-363 (G. Hunt ed. 1901). We have interpreted the Commerce Clause to invalidate local laws that impose commercial
barriers or discriminate against an article of commerce by
reason of its origin or destination out of State. See, e. g.,
Philadelphia, supra (striking down New Jersey statute that
prohibited the import of solid waste); Hughes v. Oklahoma,
441 U. S. 322 (1979) (striking down Oklahoma law that prohibited the export of natural minnows).

Clarkstown protests that its ordinance does not discriminate because it does not differentiate solid waste on the basis
of its geographic origin. All solid waste, regardless of origin, must be processed at the designated transfer station before it leaves the town. Unlike the statute in Philadelphia,
says the town, the ordinance erects no barrier to the import
or export of any solid waste but requires only that the waste
be channeled through the designated facility.

Our initial discussion of the effects of the ordinance on
interstate commerce goes far toward refuting the town's contention that there is no discrimination in its regulatory
scheme. The town's own arguments go the rest of the way.
As the town itself points out, what makes garbage a profit511us2$48L 11-08-97 20:01:04 PAGES OPINPGT

391Cite as: 511 U. S. 383 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
able business is not its own worth but the fact that its pos-sessor must pay to get rid of it. In other words, the article

of commerce is not so much the solid waste itself, but ratherthe service of processing and disposing of it.

With respect to this stream of commerce, the flow control
ordinance discriminates, for it allows only the favored opera-tor to process waste that is within the limits of the town.

The ordinance is no less discriminatory because in-state orin-town processors are also covered by the prohibition. In
Dean Milk Co. v. Madison, 340 U. S. 349 (1951), we struckdown a city ordinance that required all milk sold in the city
to be pasteurized within five miles of the city lines. We
found it "immaterial that Wisconsin milk from outside the
Madison area is subjected to the same proscription as that
moving in interstate commerce." Id., at 354, n. 4. Accord,
Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Michigan Dept. of
Natural Resources, 504 U. S., at 361 ("[O]ur prior cases teach
that a State (or one of its political subdivisions) may not
avoid the strictures of the Commerce Clause by curtailing
the movement of articles of commerce through subdivisions
of the State, rather than through the State itself ").

In this light, the flow control ordinance is just one more
instance of local processing requirements that we long have
held invalid. See Minnesota v. Barber, 136 U. S. 313 (1890)
(striking down a Minnesota statute that required any meat
sold within the State, whether originating within or without
the State, to be examined by an inspector within the State);
Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 1 (1928)
(striking down a Louisiana statute that forbade shrimp to be
exported unless the heads and hulls had first been removed
within the State); Johnson v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 16 (1928)
(striking down analogous Louisiana statute for oysters);
Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385 (1948) (striking down South
Carolina statute that required shrimp fishermen to unload,
pack, and stamp their catch before shipping it to another
State); Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., supra (striking down

511us2$48L 11-08-97 20:01:04 PAGES OPINPGT
392 C & A CARBONE, INC. v. CLARKSTOWN

Opinion of the Court
Arizona statute that required all Arizona-grown cantaloupesto be packaged within the State prior to export);

SouthCentral Timber Development, Inc. v. Wunnicke, 467 U. S. 82(1984) (striking down an Alaska regulation that required all

Alaska timber to be processed within the State prior to export). The essential vice in laws of this sort is that theybar the import of the processing service. Out-of-state meat

inspectors, or shrimp hullers, or milk pasteurizers, are de-prived of access to local demand for their services. Put another way, the offending local laws hoard a local resource--be it meat, shrimp, or milk--for the benefit of local businesses that treat it.

The flow control ordinance has the same design and effect.
It hoards solid waste, and the demand to get rid of it, for the
benefit of the preferred processing facility. The only conceivable distinction from the cases cited above is that the
flow control ordinance favors a single local proprietor. But
this difference just makes the protectionist effect of the ordinance more acute. In Dean Milk, the local processing requirement at least permitted pasteurizers within five miles
of the city to compete. An out-of-state pasteurizer who
wanted access to that market might have built a pasteurizing
facility within the radius. The flow control ordinance at
issue here squelches competition in the waste-processing
service altogether, leaving no room for investment from
outside.

Discrimination against interstate commerce in favor of
local business or investment is per se invalid, save in a narrow class of cases in which the municipality can demonstrate,
under rigorous scrutiny, that it has no other means to advance a legitimate local interest. Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S.
131 (1986) (upholding Maine's ban on the import of baitfish
because Maine had no other way to prevent the spread of
parasites and the adulteration of its native fish species). A
number of amici contend that the flow control ordinance fits
into this narrow class. They suggest that as landfill space

393Cite as: 511 U. S. 383 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
diminishes and environmental cleanup costs escalate, meas-ures like flow control become necessary to ensure the safe

handling and proper treatment of solid waste.The teaching of our cases is that these arguments must be
rejected absent the clearest showing that the unobstructed
flow of interstate commerce itself is unable to solve the localproblem. The Commerce Clause presumes a national market free from local legislation that discriminates in favor oflocal interests. Here Clarkstown has any number of nondiscriminatory alternatives for addressing the health and envi-ronmental problems alleged to justify the ordinance in question. The most obvious would be uniform safety regulations
enacted without the object to discriminate. These regulations would ensure that competitors like Carbone do not
underprice the market by cutting corners on environmental
safety.

Nor may Clarkstown justify the flow control ordinance as
a way to steer solid waste away from out-of-town disposal
sites that it might deem harmful to the environment. To do
so would extend the town's police power beyond its jurisdictional bounds. States and localities may not attach restrictions to exports or imports in order to control commerce in
other States. Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U. S. 511
(1935) (striking down New York law that prohibited the sale
of milk unless the price paid to the original milk producer
equaled the minimum required by New York).

The flow control ordinance does serve a central purpose
that a nonprotectionist regulation would not: It ensures that
the town-sponsored facility will be profitable, so that the
local contractor can build it and Clarkstown can buy it back
at nominal cost in five years. In other words, as the most
candid of amici and even Clarkstown admit, the flow control
ordinance is a financing measure. By itself, of course, revenue generation is not a local interest that can justify discrimination against interstate commerce. Otherwise States
could impose discriminatory taxes against solid waste origi511us2$48L 11-08-97 20:01:04 PAGES OPINPGT
394 C & A CARBONE, INC. v. CLARKSTOWN

Opinion of the Court
nating outside the State. See Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v. Hunt, 504 U. S. 334 (1992) (striking down Alabama statute that imposed additional fee on all hazardouswaste generated outside the State and disposed of within

the State); Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of
Environmental Quality of Ore., ante, p. 93 (striking downOregon statute that imposed additional fee on solid waste

generated outside the State and disposed of within theState).

Clarkstown maintains that special financing is necessaryto ensure the long-term survival of the designated facility.
If so, the town may subsidize the facility through general
taxes or municipal bonds. New Energy Co. of Ind. v.
Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 278 (1988). But having elected to
use the open market to earn revenues for its project, the
town may not employ discriminatory regulation to give
that project an advantage over rival businesses from out of
State.

Though the Clarkstown ordinance may not in explicit
terms seek to regulate interstate commerce, it does so nonetheless by its practical effect and design. In this respect
the ordinance is not far different from the state law this
Court found invalid in Buck v. Kuykendall, 267 U. S. 307
(1925). That statute prohibited common carriers from using
state highways over certain routes without a certificate of
public convenience. Writing for the Court, Justice Brandeis
said of the law: "Its primary purpose is not regulation with
a view to safety or to conservation of the highways, but the
prohibition of competition. It determines not the manner of
use, but the persons by whom the highways may be used.
It prohibits such use to some persons while permitting it to
others for the same purpose and in the same manner." Id.,
at 315-316.

State and local governments may not use their regulatory
power to favor local enterprise by prohibiting patronage of
out-of-state competitors or their facilities. We reverse the

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
Justice O'Connor, concurring in the judgment.
The town of Clarkstown's flow control ordinance requiresall "acceptable waste" generated or collected in the town to

be disposed of only at the town's solid waste facility. Townof Clarkstown, Local Law 9, $$ 3.C-D (1990) (Local Law 9).
The Court holds today that this ordinance violates the Com-merce Clause because it discriminates against interstate
commerce. Ante, at 390. I agree with the majority's ulti-mate conclusion that the ordinance violates the dormant
Commerce Clause. In my view, however, the town's ordi-nance is unconstitutional not because of facial or effective
discrimination against interstate commerce, but rather be-cause it imposes an excessive burden on interstate commerce. I also write separately to address the contentionthat flow control ordinances of this sort have been expressly
authorized by Congress, and are thus outside the purview ofthe dormant Commerce Clause.

I
The scope of the dormant Commerce Clause is a judicialcreation. On its face, the Clause provides only that "[t]he

Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce . . .among the several States . . . ." U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8,
cl. 3. This Court long ago concluded, however, that theClause not only empowers Congress to regulate interstate
commerce, but also imposes limitations on the States in theabsence of congressional action:

"This principle that our economic unit is the Nation,which alone has the gamut of powers necessary to control of the economy, including the vital power of erectingcustoms barriers against foreign competition, has as its
corollary that the states are not separable economicunits. . . . [W]hat is ultimate is the principle that one
state in its dealings with another may not place itself ina position of economic isolation."

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U. S. 525, 537-538 (1949) (internalquotation marks and citations omitted).

Our decisions therefore hold that the dormant CommerceClause forbids States and their subdivisions to regulate
interstate commerce.We have generally distinguished between two types of impermissible regulations. A facially nondiscriminatory regu-lation supported by a legitimate state interest which incidentally burdens interstate commerce is constitutional unlessthe burden on interstate trade is clearly excessive in relation
to the local benefits. See Brown-Forman Distillers Corp.v.

New York State Liquor Authority, 476 U. S. 573, 579(1986); Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970).

Where, however, a regulation "affirmatively" or "clearly"discriminates against interstate commerce on its face or

in practical effect, it violates the Constitution unless thediscrimination is demonstrably justified by a valid factor
unrelated to protectionism. See Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502U. S. 437, 454 (1992);

Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131, 138(1986). Of course, there is no clear line separating these

categories. "In either situation the critical considerationis the overall effect of the statute on both local and interstate
activity." Brown-Forman Distillers, supra, at 579.Local Law 9 prohibits anyone except the town-authorized
transfer station operator from processing discarded wasteand shipping it out of town. In effect, the town has given a
waste processing monopoly to the transfer station. The ma-jority concludes that this processing monopoly facially discriminates against interstate commerce. Ante, at 391-392.In support of this conclusion, the majority cites previous decisions of this Court striking down regulatory enactmentsrequiring that a particular economic activity be performed
within the jurisdiction. See, e. g., Dean Milk Co. v. Madi-son, 340 U. S. 349 (1951) (unconstitutional for city to require
milk to be pasteurized within five miles of the city); Minne-sota v. Barber, 136 U. S. 313 (1890) (unconstitutional for State

to require meat sold within the State to be examined bystate inspector);

Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, 278
U. S. 1 (1928) (unconstitutional for State to require thatshrimp heads and hulls must be removed before shrimp can

be removed from the State); South-Central Timber Development, Inc. v. Wunnicke, 467 U. S. 82 (1984) (unconstitutionalfor State to require all timber to be processed within the

State prior to export).Local Law 9, however, lacks an important feature common
to the regulations at issue in these cases--namely, discrimi-nation on the basis of geographic origin. In each of the cited
cases, the challenged enactment gave a competitive advantage to local business as a group vis-a` -vis their out-of-state
or nonlocal competitors as a group. In effect, the regulating
jurisdiction--be it a State (Pike), a county (Fort Gratiot
Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, 504 U. S. 353 (1992)), or a city (Dean Milk)--drew
a line around itself and treated those inside the line more
favorably than those outside the line. Thus, in Pike, the
Court held that an Arizona law requiring that Arizona cantaloupes be packaged in Arizona before being shipped out of
state facially discriminated against interstate commerce:
The benefits of the discriminatory scheme benefited the Arizona packaging industry, at the expense of its competition in
California. Similarly, in Dean Milk, on which the majority
heavily relies, the city of Madison drew a line around its
perimeter and required that all milk sold in the city be pasteurized only by dairies located inside the line. This type
of geographic distinction, which confers an economic advantage on local interests in general, is common to all the local
processing cases cited by the majority. And the Court has,
I believe, correctly concluded that these arrangements are
protectionist either in purpose or practical effect, and thus
amount to virtually per se discrimination.

In my view, the majority fails to come to terms with a
significant distinction between the laws in the local process511us2$48J 11-08-97 20:01:05 PAGES OPINPGT
404 C & A CARBONE, INC. v. CLARKSTOWN

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
ing cases discussed above and Local Law 9. Unlike theregulations we have previously struck down, Local Law 9

does not give more favorable treatment to local interestsas a group as compared to out-of-state or out-of-town economic interests. Rather, the garbage sorting monopoly is
achieved at the expense of all competitors, be they local ornonlocal. That the ordinance does not discriminate on the

basis of geographic origin is vividly illustrated by the iden-tity of the plaintiffs in this very action: Petitioners are

local
recyclers, physically located in Clarkstown, that desire toprocess waste themselves, and thus bypass the town's designated transfer facility. Because in-town processors--like
petitioners--and out-of-town processors are treated equally,
I cannot agree that Local Law 9 "discriminates" against interstate commerce. Rather, Local Law 9 "discriminates"
evenhandedly against all potential participants in the waste
processing business, while benefiting only the chosen operator of the transfer facility.

I believe this distinction has more doctrinal significance
than the majority acknowledges. In considering state
health and safety regulations such as Local Law 9, we have
consistently recognized that the fact that interests within
the regulating jurisdiction are equally affected by the challenged enactment counsels against a finding of discrimination. And for good reason. The existence of substantial

line separating those enactments which are virtually per seinvalid and those which are not, the fact that in-town competitors of the transfer facility are equally burdened byLocal Law 9 leads me to conclude that Local Law 9 does not
discriminate against interstate commerce.

II
That the ordinance does not discriminate against inter-state commerce does not, however, end the Commerce

Clause inquiry. Even a nondiscriminatory regulation maynonetheless impose an excessive burden on interstate trade
when considered in relation to the local benefits conferred.See Brown-Forman Distillers, 476 U. S., at 579. Indeed, we
have long recognized that "a burden imposed by a State uponinterstate commerce is not to be sustained simply because
the statute imposing it applies alike to . . . the people of theState enacting such statute."

Brimmer v. Rebman, 138U. S. 78, 83 (1891) (internal quotation marks and citation

omitted). Moreover, "the extent of the burden that will betolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local
interest involved, and on whether it could be promoted aswell with a lesser impact on interstate activities." Pike, 397
U. S., at 142. Judged against these standards, Local Law9 fails.

The local interest in proper disposal of waste is obviouslysignificant. But this interest could be achieved by simply
requiring that all waste disposed of in the town be properlyprocessed

somewhere. For example, the town could ensureproper processing by setting specific standards with which

all town processors must comply.In fact, however, the town's purpose is narrower than
merely ensuring proper disposal. Local Law 9 is intendedto ensure the financial viability of the transfer facility. I
agree with the majority that this purpose can be achievedby other means that would have a less dramatic impact on
the flow of goods. For example, the town could finance the

project by imposing taxes, by issuing municipal bonds, oreven by lowering its price for processing to a level competitive with other waste processing facilities. But by requiringthat all waste be processed at the town's facility, the ordinance "squelches competition in the waste-processing service
altogether, leaving no room for investment from outside."
Ante, at 392.

In addition, " `[t]he practical effect of [Local Law 9] mustbe evaluated not only by considering the consequences of the

statute itself, but also by considering how the challengedstatute may interact with the legitimate regulatory regimes
of the other States and what effect would arise if not one, butmany or every, [ jurisdiction] adopted similar legislation.' "
Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U. S., at 453-454 (quoting Healy
v. Beer Institute, 491 U. S. 324, 336 (1989)). This is not ahypothetical inquiry. Over 20 States have enacted statutes

authorizing local governments to adopt flow control laws.*If the localities in these States impose the type of restriction
on the movement of waste that Clarkstown has adopted, thefree movement of solid waste in the stream of commerce will
be severely impaired. Indeed, pervasive flow control wouldresult in the type of balkanization the Clause is primarily
intended to prevent. See H. P. Hood & Sons, 336 U. S., at
537-538.

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
Given that many jurisdictions are contemplating or enact-ing flow control, the potential for conflicts is high. For example, in the State of New Jersey, just south of Clarkstown,local waste may be removed from the State for the sorting
of recyclables "as long as the residual solid waste is returnedto New Jersey." Brief for New Jersey as

Amicus Curiae 5.Under Local Law 9, however, if petitioners bring waste from

New Jersey for recycling at their Clarkstown operation, theresidual waste may not be returned to New Jersey, but must
be transported to Clarkstown's transfer facility. As a con-sequence, operations like petitioners' cannot comply with
the requirements of both jurisdictions. Nondiscriminatorystate or local laws which actually conflict with the enactments of other States are constitutionally infirm if theyburden interstate commerce. See

Bibb v. Navajo FreightLines, Inc., 359 U. S. 520, 526-530 (1959) (unconstitutional for

Illinois to require truck mudguards when that requirementconflicts with the requirements of other States); Southern
Pacific Co. v. Arizona ex rel. Sullivan, 325 U. S. 761, 773-774(1945) (same). The increasing number of flow control regimes virtually ensures some inconsistency between juris-dictions, with the effect of eliminating the movement of
waste between jurisdictions. I therefore conclude that theburden Local Law 9 imposes on interstate commerce is
excessive in relation to Clarkstown's interest in ensuringa fixed supply of waste to supply its project.

Although this Court can--and often does--enforce thedormant aspect of the Commerce Clause, the Clause is primarily a grant of congressional authority to regulate com-merce among the States.

Amicus National Association of
Bond Lawyers (NABL) argues that the flow control ordi-nance in this case has been authorized by Congress. Given

the residual nature of our authority under the Clause, and

because the argument that Congress has in fact authorizedflow control is substantial, I think it appropriate to address

it directly.Congress must be "unmistakably clear" before we will conclude that it intended to permit state regulation which would
otherwise violate the dormant Commerce Clause. SouthCentral Timber, 467 U. S., at 91 (plurality opinion). See also
Sporhase v. Nebraska ex rel. Douglas, 458 U. S. 941, 960(1982) (finding consent only where "Congress' intent and policy to sustain state legislation from attack under the Com-merce Clause was expressly stated") (citations and internal
quotation marks omitted). The State or locality has the
burden of demonstrating this intent. Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U. S., at 458.

Amicus NABL argues that Subchapter IV of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), 90 Stat.
2813, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 6941 et seq., and its amendments, remove the constitutional constraints on local implementation of flow control. RCRA is a sweeping statute intended to regulate solid waste from cradle to grave. In
addition to providing specific federal standards for the
management of solid waste, RCRA Subchapter IV governs
"State or Regional Solid Waste Plans." Among the objectives of the subchapter is to "assist in developing and encouraging methods for the disposal of solid waste which are environmentally sound"; this is to be accomplished by federal
"assistance to States or regional authorities for comprehensive planning pursuant to Federal guidelines." $ 6941.

Under RCRA, States are to submit solid waste management plans that "prohibit the establishment of new open
dumps within the State," and ensure that solid waste will be
"utilized for resource recovery or . . . disposed of in sanitary
landfills . . . or otherwise disposed of in an environmentally
sound manner." $ 6943(a)(2). The plans must also ensure
that state and local governments not be "prohibited under
State or local law from negotiating and entering into long511us2$48J 11-08-97 20:01:05 PAGES OPINPGT

term contracts for the supply of solid waste to resource recovery facilities [or] from entering into long-term contracts
for the operation of such facilities." $ 6943(a)(5).

Amicus also points to a statement in a House Report addressing $ 6943(a)(5), a statement evincing some concern
with flow control:

"This prohibition [on state or local laws prohibiting
long-term contracts] is not to be construed to affect state
planning which may require all discarded materials to
be transported to a particular location. . . ." H. R. Rep.
No. 94-1491, p. 34 (1976) (emphasis added).

Finally, in the Solid Waste Disposal Act Amendments of
1980, Congress authorized the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) to "provide technical assistance to States [and
local governments] to assist in the removal or modification
of legal, institutional, and economic impediments which have
the effect of impeding the development of systems and facilities [for resource recovery]." $ 6948(d)(3). Among the obstacles to effective resource recovery are "impediments to
institutional arrangements necessary to undertake projects
. . . including the creation of special districts, authorities,
or corporations where necessary having the power to secure
the supply of waste of a project." $ 6948(d)(3)(C) (emphasis
added).

I agree with amicus NABL that these references indicate
that Congress expected local governments to implement
some form of flow control. Nonetheless, they neither individually nor cumulatively rise to the level of the "explicit"
authorization required by our dormant Commerce Clause decisions. First, the primary focus of the references is on legal
impediments imposed as a result of state--not federal--law.
In addition, the reference to local authority to "secure the
supply of waste" is contained in $ 6948(d)(3)(C), which is a
delegation not to the States but to EPA of authority to assist

local government in solving waste supply problems. EPAhas stated in its implementing regulations that the "State

plan should provide for substate cooperation and policies forfree and unrestricted movement of solid and hazardous waste
across State and local boundaries." 40 CFR $ 256.42(h)
(1993). And while the House Report seems to contemplate
that municipalities may require waste to be brought to a particular location, this stronger language is not reflected in the
text of the statute. Cf. United States v. Nordic Village,
Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 37 (1992) (for waiver of sovereign immunity, "[i]f clarity does not exist [in the text], it cannot be
supplied by a committee report"); Dellmuth v. Muth, 491
U. S. 223, 230 (1989) (same). In short, these isolated references do not satisfy our requirement of an explicit statutory authorization.

It is within Congress' power to authorize local imposition
of flow control. Should Congress revisit this area, and enact
legislation providing a clear indication that it intends States
and localities to implement flow control, we will, of course,
defer to that legislative judgment. Until then, however,
Local Law 9 cannot survive constitutional scrutiny. Accordingly, I concur in the judgment of the Court.

Justice Souter, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Blackmun join, dissenting.

The majority may invoke "well-settled principles of our
Commerce Clause jurisprudence," ante, at 386, but it does
so to strike down an ordinance unlike anything this Court has
ever invalidated. Previous cases have held that the "negative" or "dormant" aspect of the Commerce Clause renders
state or local legislation unconstitutional when it discriminates against out-of-state or out-of-town businesses such as
those that pasteurize milk, hull shrimp, or mill lumber, and
the majority relies on these cases because of what they have
in common with this one: out-of-state processors are ex511us2$48M 11-08-97 20:01:05 PAGES OPINPGT

cluded from the local market (here, from the market for trash
processing services). What the majority ignores, however,
are the differences between our local processing cases and
this one: the exclusion worked by Clarkstown's Local Law 9
bestows no benefit on a class of local private actors, but instead directly aids the government in satisfying a traditional
governmental responsibility. The law does not differentiate
between all local and all out-of-town providers of a service,
but instead between the one entity responsible for ensuring
that the job gets done and all other enterprises, regardless
of their location. The ordinance thus falls outside that class
of tariff or protectionist measures that the Commerce Clause
has traditionally been thought to bar States from enacting
against each other, and when the majority subsumes the ordinance within the class of laws this Court has struck down
as facially discriminatory (and so avails itself of our "virtually per se rule" against such statutes, see Philadelphia v.
New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 624 (1978)), the majority is in fact
greatly extending the Clause's dormant reach.

There are, however, good and sufficient reasons against
expanding the Commerce Clause's inherent capacity to
trump exercises of state authority such as the ordinance at
issue here. There is no indication in the record that any
out-of-state trash processor has been harmed, or that the
interstate movement or disposition of trash will be affected
one whit. To the degree Local Law 9 affects the market
for trash processing services, it does so only by subjecting
Clarkstown residents and businesses to burdens far different
from the burdens of local favoritism that dormant Commerce
Clause jurisprudence seeks to root out. The town has found
a way to finance a public improvement, not by transferring
its cost to out-of-state economic interests, but by spreading
it among the local generators of trash, an equitable result
with tendencies that should not disturb the Commerce
Clause and should not be disturbed by us.

412 C & A CARBONE, INC. v. CLARKSTOWN

Souter, J., dissenting

I
Prior to the 1970's, getting rid of the trash in Clarkstownwas just a matter of taking it to the local dump. But over

the course of that decade, state regulators cited the town fordumping in violation of environmental laws, and in August
1989 the town entered into a consent decree with the NewYork State Department of Environmental Conservation,
promising to close the landfill, clean up the environmentaldamage, and make new arrangements to dispose of the
town's solid waste. Clarkstown agreed to build a "transferstation" where the town's trash would be brought for sorting
out recyclable material and baling the nonrecyclable residuefor loading into long-haul trucks bound for out-of-state disposal sites.Instead of building the transfer station itself, Clarkstown
contracted with a private company to build the stationand run it for five years, after which the town could buy it
for $1. The town based the size of the facility on its bestestimate of the amount of trash local residents would generate and undertook to deliver that amount to the transfer sta-tion each year, or to pay a substantial penalty to compensate
for any shortfall. This "put or pay" contract, together withthe right to charge an $81 "tipping" fee for each ton of waste
collected at the transfer station, was meant to assure thecompany its return on investment.

Local Law 9, the ordinance at issue here, is an integralpart of this financing scheme. It prohibits individual trash
generators within the town from evading payment of the $81tipping fee by requiring that all residential, commercial, and
industrial waste generated or collected within the town be
delivered to the transfer station. While Clarkstown resi-dents may dump their waste at another locally licensed recycling center, once such a private recycler culls out the re-cyclable materials, it must dispose of any residue the same
way other Clarkstown residents do, by taking it to the town's

transfer station. Local Law 9, $$ 3.C, 3.D (1990).1 If out-of-towners wish to dispose of their waste in Clarkstown or

recycle it there, they enter the town subject to the same
restrictions as Clarkstown residents, in being required to use
only the town-operated transfer station or a licensed recycling center. $ 5.A.

Petitioner C & A Carbone, Inc., operated a recycling center in Clarkstown, according to a state permit authorizing it
to collect waste, separate out the recyclables for sale, and
dispose of the rest. In violation of Local Law 9, Carbone
failed to bring this nonrecyclable residue to the town transfer station, but took it directly to out-of-state incinerators
and landfills, including some of the very same ones to which
the Clarkstown transfer station sends its trash. Apparently, Carbone bypassed the Clarkstown facility on account
of the $81 tipping fee, saving Carbone money, but costing the
town thousands in lost revenue daily. In this resulting legal
action, Carbone's complaint is one that any Clarkstown trash
generator could have made: the town has created a monopoly
on trash processing services, and residents are no longer free
to provide these services for themselves or to contract for
them with others at a mutually agreeable price.

II
We are not called upon to judge the ultimate wisdom of
creating this local monopoly, but we are asked to say
whether Clarkstown's monopoly violates the Commerce
Clause, as long read by this Court to limit the power of state
and local governments to discriminate against interstate
commerce:

1 The ordinance has exceptions not at issue here for hazardous waste,
pathological waste, and sludge, and for source-separated recyclables,
which can be disposed of within or outside the town. Local Law 9, $$ 1,

"[The] `negative' aspect of the Commerce Clause prohib-its economic protectionism--that is, regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic interests byburdening out-of-state competitors. Thus, state statutes that clearly discriminate against interstate com-merce are routinely struck down, unless the discrimination is demonstrably justified by a valid factor unrelatedto economic protectionism."

This limitation on the state and local power has been seenimplicit in the Commerce Clause because, as the majority

recognizes, the Framers sought to dampen regional jealous-ies in general and, in particular, to eliminate retaliatory tariffs, which had poisoned commercial relations under the Arti-cles of Confederation. Ante, at 390. Laws that hoard for
local businesses the right to serve local markets or developlocal resources work to isolate States from each other and to
incite retaliation, since no State would stand by while an-other advanced the economic interests of its own business

The majority argues that resolution of the issue before usis controlled by a line of cases in which we have struck down

face, prohibiting the interstate shipment of respondent's cantaloupes unless they were first packaged locally, the statute it sought to enforce
merely required that Arizona-grown cantaloupes advertise their State of
origin on each package. In Part III, I discuss the line of cases in which
we have struck down statutes that, although lacking explicit geographical
sorting mechanisms, are discriminatory in practical effect.

cases squarely within the larger class of cases in which thisCourt has invalidated facially discriminatory legislation.

As the majority recognizes, Local Law 9 shares two fea-tures with these local processing cases. It regulates a processing service available in interstate commerce, i. e., thesorting and baling of solid waste for disposal. And it does
so in a fashion that excludes out-of-town trash processors byits very terms. These parallels between Local Law 9 and
the statutes previously invalidated confer initial plausibilityon the majority's classification of this case with those earlier
ones on processing, and they even bring this one within themost general language of some of the earlier cases, abhorring

B
There are, however, both analytical and practical differ-ences between this and the earlier processing cases, differences the majority underestimates or overlooks but which, ifgiven their due, should prevent this case from being decided
the same way. First, the terms of Clarkstown's ordinancefavor a single processor, not the class of all such businesses
located in Clarkstown. Second, the one proprietor so fa-vored is essentially an agent of the municipal government,
which (unlike Carbone or other private trash processors)must ensure the removal of waste according to acceptable
standards of public health. Any discrimination worked byLocal Law 9 thus fails to produce the sort of entrepreneurial
favoritism we have previously defined and condemned asprotectionist.

The outstanding feature of the statutes or ordinances re-viewed in the local processing cases is their distinction between two classes of private economic actors according tolocation, favoring shrimp hullers within Louisiana, milk pasteurizers within five miles of the center of Madison, and so on.See

Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 1 (1928);Dean Milk Co. v. Madison, supra. Since nothing in these

local processing laws prevented a proliferation of local busi-nesses within the State or town, the out-of-town processors
were not excluded as part and parcel of a general exclusion ofprivate firms from the market, but as a result of discrimination
among such firms according to geography alone. It was be-cause of that discrimination in favor of local businesses, preferred at the expense of their out-of-town or out-of-statecompetitors, that the Court struck down those local process511us2$48M 11-08-97 20:01:05 PAGES OPINPGT

The majority recognizes, but discounts, this difference be-tween laws favoring all local actors and this law favoring a

single municipal one. According to the majority, "this dif-ference just makes the protectionist effect of the ordinance
more acute" because outside investors cannot even buildcompeting facilities within Clarkstown.

Ante, at 392. Butof course Clarkstown investors face the same prohibition,

which is to say that Local Law 9's exclusion of outside capi-tal is part of a broader exclusion of private capital, not a
discrimination against out-of-state investors as such.7 Cf.Lewis v. BT Investment Managers, Inc., 447 U. S. 27 (1980)
(striking down statute prohibiting businesses owned by out-of-state banks, bank holding companies, or trust companies
from providing investment advisory services). Thus, whilethese differences may underscore the ordinance's anticompetitive effect, they substantially mitigate any protectionisteffect, for subjecting out-of-town investors and facilities to
the same constraints as local ones is not economic protec-tionism. See

own the private firm that built Clarkstown's transfer station for the
municipality.

in-state or in-town processors are also covered by [its] prohibition."

distinction between laws that discriminate based on geography and those
that do not, authority for it is lacking. The majority supports its statement by citing from a footnote in Dean Milk, that "[i]t is immaterial that
Wisconsin milk from outside the Madison area is subjected to the same
proscription as that moving in interstate commerce," 340 U. S., at 354, n. 4,

invalidates geographical restrictions phrased in miles as well as in terms
of political boundaries. This reading is confirmed by the fact that the

Nor is the monopolist created by Local Law 9 just another
private company successfully enlisting local government to
protect the jobs and profits of local citizens. While our previous local processing cases have barred discrimination in
markets served by private companies, Clarkstown's transfer
station is essentially a municipal facility, built and operated
under a contract with the municipality and soon to revert
entirely to municipal ownership.9 This, of course, is no mere
coincidence, since the facility performs a municipal function
that tradition as well as state and federal law recognize as
the domain of local government. Throughout the history of
this country, municipalities have taken responsibility for disposing of local garbage to prevent noisome smells, obstruction of the streets, and threats to public health,10 and today

Dean Milk Court's only explanation for its statement was to cite a case
striking down a statute forbidding the selling of " `any fresh meats . . .
slaughtered one hundred miles or over from the place at which it is offered
for sale, until and except it has been inspected' " at a cost to its owner
of a penny per pound. Brimmer v. Rebman, 138 U. S. 78, 80 (1891) (quoting Acts of Va. 1889-1890, p. 63, ch. 80). That the majority here cites
also to Fort Gratiot Landfill v. Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources,
supra, may indicate that it reads Dean Milk the same way I do, but then
it cannot use the case to stand for the more radical proposition I quoted
above.

9 At the end of a 5-year term, during which the private contractor receives profits sufficient to induce it to provide the plant in the first place,
the town will presumably step into the contractor's shoes for the nominal
dollar. Such contracts, enlisting a private company to build, operate, and
then transfer to local government an expensive public improvement, enable municipalities to acquire public facilities without resorting to municipal funds or credit.

10 For example, in 1764 the South Carolina Legislature established a

street commission for Charleston with the power "to remove all filth and
rubbish, to such proper place or places, in or near the said town, as they

78 percent of landfills receiving municipal solid waste areowned by local governments. See U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act,Subtitle D Study: Phase 1 Report, p. 4-7 (Oct. 1986) (Table
4-2). The National Government provides "technical and fi-nancial assistance to States or regional authorities for comprehensive planning" with regard to the disposal of solidwaste, 42 U. S. C. $ 6941, and the State of New York authorizes local governments to prepare such management plansfor the proper disposal of all solid waste generated within
their jurisdictions, N. Y. Envir. Conserv. Law $ 27-0107 (Mc-Kinney Supp. 1994). These general provisions underlie
Clarkstown's more specific obligation (under its consent de-cree with the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation) to establish a transfer station in place of theold town dump, and it is to finance this transfer station that
Local Law 9 was passed.The majority ignores this distinction between public and
private enterprise, equating Local Law 9's "hoard[ing]" ofsolid waste for the municipal transfer station with the design
and effect of ordinances that restrict access to local marketsfor the benefit of local private firms.

Indeed, some communities have employed flow control ordinances in

free from subsequent aspersion, for they illustrate that even at the height
of the Lochner era the Court recognized that for municipalities struggling
to abate their garbage problems, the Constitution did not require unimpeded private enterprise.

private interests of their owners, and there is therefore only
rarely a reason other than economic protectionism for favoring local businesses over their out-of-town competitors.
The local government itself occupies a very different market
position, however, being the one entity that enters the market to serve the public interest of local citizens quite apart
from private interest in private gain. Reasons other than
economic protectionism are accordingly more likely to explain the design and effect of an ordinance that favors a public facility. The facility as constructed might, for example,
be one that private economic actors, left to their own devices,
would not have built, but which the locality needs in order
to abate (or guarantee against creating) a public nuisance.
There is some evidence in this case that this is so, as the
New York State Department of Environmental Conservation
would have had no reason to insist that Clarkstown build
its own transfer station if the private market had furnished
adequate processing capacity to meet Clarkstown's needs.
An ordinance that favors a municipal facility, in any event, is
one that favors the public sector, and if "we continue to recognize that the States occupy a special and specific position
in our constitutional system and that the scope of Congress'
authority under the Commerce Clause must reflect that position," Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 556 (1985), then surely this Court's dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence must itself see that
favoring state-sponsored facilities differs from discriminating among private economic actors, and is much less likely
to be protectionist.

Having established that Local Law 9 does not serve the
competitive class identified in previous local processing cases
and that Clarkstown differs correspondingly from other local
processors, we must ask whether these differences justify a
standard of dormant Commerce Clause review that differs

from the virtually fatal scrutiny imposed in those earliercases. I believe they do.

The justification for subjecting the local processing lawsand the broader class of clearly discriminatory commercial
regulation to near-fatal scrutiny is the virtual certainty thatsuch laws, at least in their discriminatory aspect, serve no
legitimate, nonprotectionist purpose. See Philadelphia v.
New Jersey, 437 U. S., at 624 ("[W]here simple economic pro-tectionism is effected by state legislation, a virtually per se

rule of invalidity has been erected").11 Whether we find"the evil of protectionism," id., at 626, in the clear import of
specific statutory provisions or in the legislature's ultimatepurpose, the discriminatory scheme is almost always designed either to favor local industry, as such, or to achievesome other goal while exporting a disproportionate share of
the burden of attaining it, which is merely a subtler form oflocal favoritism,

id., at 626-628.On the other hand, in a market served by a municipal facility, a law that favors that single facility over all others isa law that favors the public sector over all private-sector
processors, whether local or out of State. Because the favordoes not go to local private competitors of out-of-state firms,
out-of-state governments will at the least lack a motive to
favor their own firms in order to equalize the positions ofprivate competitors. While a preference in favor of the government may incidentally function as local favoritism as well,a more particularized enquiry is necessary before a court can
say whether such a law does in fact smack too strongly ofeconomic protectionism. If Local Law 9 is to be struck
down, in other words, it must be under that test most readily

11 For the rare occasion when discriminatory laws are the best vehicle
for furthering a legitimate state interest, Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131
(1986), provides an exception, but we need not address that exception here
because this ordinance is not subject to the presumption of unconstitutionality appropriate for protectionist legislation.

We have said that when legislation that does not facially discriminate "comes into conflict with the Commerce
Clause's overriding requirement of a national `common market,' we are confronted with the task of effecting an accommodation of the competing national and local interests."
Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432
U. S. 333, 350 (1977). Although this analysis of competing
interests has sometimes been called a "balancing test," it is
not so much an open-ended weighing of an ordinance's pros
and cons, as an assessment of whether an ordinance discriminates in practice or otherwise unjustifiably operates to isolate a State's economy from the national common market. If
a statute or local ordinance serves a legitimate local interest
and does not patently discriminate, "it will be upheld unless
the burden imposed on [interstate] commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits." Pike v.
Bruce Church, Inc., supra, at 142. The analysis is similar
to, but softer around the edges than,12 the test we employ in
cases of overt discrimination. "[T]he question becomes one
of degree," and its answer depends on the nature of the burden on interstate commerce, the nature of the local interest,
and the availability of alternative methods for advancing the

12 Where discrimination is not patent on the face of a statute, the party
challenging its constitutionality has a more difficult task, but appropriately so because the danger posed by such laws is generally smaller. Discrimination that is not patent or purposeful "in effect may be substantially
less likely to provoke retaliation by other states . . . . In the words of
Justice Holmes, `even a dog distinguishes between being stumbled over
and being kicked.' " Smith, 74 Calif. L. Rev., at 1251 (quoting O. W.
Holmes, The Common Law 3 (1881)). See also Regan, The Supreme
Court and State Protectionism: Making Sense of the Dormant Commerce

local interest without hindering the national one. 397 U. S.,at 142, 145.

The primary burden Carbone attributes to flow control or-dinances such as Local Law 9 is that they "prevent trash
from being sent to the most cost-effective disposal facilities,and insulate the designated facility from all price competition." Brief for Petitioners 32. In this case, customersmust pay $11 per ton more for dumping trash at the Clarkstown transfer station than they would pay at Carbone's facil-ity, although this dollar figure presumably overstates the
burden by disguising some differences between the two: ac-cording to its state permit, 90 percent of Carbone's waste
stream comprises recyclable cardboard, while the Clarks-town facility takes all manner of less valuable waste, which
it treats with state-of-the-art environmental technology notemployed at Carbone's more rudimentary plant.

Fortunately, the dollar cost of the burden need not be pin-pointed, its nature being more significant than its economic
extent. When we look to its nature, it should be clear thatthe monopolistic character of Local Law 9's effects is not
itself suspicious for purposes of the Commerce Clause. Al-though the right to compete is a hallmark of the American
economy and local monopolies are subject to challenge underthe century-old Sherman Act,

13 the bar to monopolies (or,

rather, the authority to dismember and penalize them) arisesfrom a statutory, not a constitutional, mandate. No more

than the Fourteenth Amendment, the Commerce Clause"does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer's Social Statics . . . [or]

13 See 15 U. S. C. $$ 1 and 2. Indeed, other flow control ordinances have
been challenged under the Sherman Act, although without success where
municipal defendants have availed themselves of the state action exception

949 (CA6 1984); Central Iowa Refuse Systems, Inc. v. Des Moines Metropolitan Solid Waste Agency, 715 F. 2d 419 (CA8 1983). That the State of
New York's Holland-Gromack Law, 1991 N. Y. Laws, ch. 569 (McKinney),
authorizes Clarkstown's flow control ordinance may explain why no Sherman Act claim was made here.

embody a particular economic theory, whether of paternal-ism . . . or of

laissez faire." Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S.
45, 75 (1905) (Holmes, J., dissenting). The dormant Com-merce Clause does not "protec[t] the particular structure or

methods of operation in a[ny] . . . market." Exxon Corp. v.
Governor of Maryland, 437 U. S. 117, 127 (1978). The onlyright to compete that it protects is the right to compete on

terms independent of one's location.While the monopolistic nature of the burden may be disregarded, any geographically discriminatory elements must beassessed with care. We have already observed that there is
no geographically based selection among private firms, and
it is clear from the face of the ordinance that nothing hinges
on the source of trash that enters Clarkstown or upon the
destination of the processed waste that leaves the transfer
station. There is, to be sure, an incidental local economic
benefit, for the need to process Clarkstown's trash in Clarkstown will create local jobs. But this local boon is mitigated
by another feature of the ordinance, in that it finances whatever benefits it confers on the town from the pockets of the
very citizens who passed it into law. On the reasonable assumption that no one can avoid producing some trash, every
resident of Clarkstown must bear a portion of the burden
Local Law 9 imposes to support the municipal monopoly, an
uncharacteristic feature of statutes claimed to violate the
Commerce Clause.

By way of contrast, most of the local processing statutes
we have previously invalidated imposed requirements that
made local goods more expensive as they headed into the
national market, so that out-of-state economies bore the bulk
of any burden. Requiring that Alaskan timber be milled in
that State prior to export would add the value of the milling
service to the Alaskan economy at the expense of some other
State, but would not burden the Alaskans who adopted such
a law. Cf. South-Central Timber Development, Inc. v. Wunnicke, 467 U. S. 82, 92 (1984). Similarly, South Carolinians

would retain the financial benefit of a local processing re-quirement for shrimp without paying anything more themselves. Cf. Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S., at 403.14 And inPhiladelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S., at 628, the State attempted to export the burden of conserving its scarce landfillspace by barring the importation of out-of-state waste. See
also Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State
Liquor Authority, 476 U. S. 573, 580 (1986) (price reductionfor in-state consumers of alcoholic beverages procured at the

expense of out-of-state consumers). Courts step in throughthe dormant Commerce Clause to prevent such exports because legislative action imposing a burden " `principally uponthose without the state . . . is not likely to be subjected to
those political restraints which are normally exerted on leg-islation where it affects adversely some interests within the
state.' " South-Central Timber, supra, at 92 (quoting South
Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Brothers, Inc., 303U. S. 177, 185, n. 2 (1938)); see also Southern Pacific Co. v.

Arizona ex rel. Sullivan, 325 U. S. 761, 767-768, n. 2 (1945).Here, in contrast, every voter in Clarkstown pays to fund
the benefits of flow control, however high the tipping fee isset. Since, indeed, the mandate to use the town facility will
only make a difference when the tipping fee raises the costof using the facility above what the market would otherwise
set, the Clarkstown voters are funding their benefit by as-sessing themselves and paying an economic penalty. Any
whiff of economic protectionism is far from obvious.15

14 I recognize that the economics differ if a State does not enjoy a significant price advantage over its neighbors and thus cannot pass along the
added costs associated with its local processing requirement, but such
States are unlikely to adopt local processing requirements for precisely
that reason.

15 This argument does not alone foreclose the possibility of economic protectionism in this case, as the ordinance could burden, in addition to the
residents of Clarkstown, out-of-town trash processors who would have
sought Clarkstown's business in the absence of flow control. But as we

427Cite as: 511 U. S. 383 (1994)
Souter, J., dissenting
An examination of the record confirms skepticism that en-forcement of the ordinance portends a Commerce Clause violation, for it shows that the burden falls entirely on Clarks-town residents. If the record contained evidence that
Clarkstown's ordinance burdened out-of-town providers ofgarbage sorting and baling services, rather than just the
local business that is a party in this case, that fact might besignificant. But petitioners have presented no evidence that
there are transfer stations outside Clarkstown capable ofhandling the town's business, and the record is devoid of evidence that such enterprises have lost business as a result ofthis ordinance. Cf.

Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S., at145 ("The nature of th[e] burden is, constitutionally, more

significant than its extent" and the danger to be avoided isthat of laws that hoard business for local residents). Similarly, if the record supported an inference that above-marketpricing at the Clarkstown transfer station caused less trash
to flow to out-of-state landfills and incinerators, that, too,might have constitutional significance. There is, however,
no evidence of any disruption in the flow of trash from curb-sides in Clarkstown to landfills in Florida and Ohio.

16 Here

will see, the absence of evidence of injury to such processors eliminates
that argument here.

16 In this context, note that the conflict Justice O'Connor hypothesizes

between multiple flow-control laws is not one that occurs in this case. If
Carbone was processing trash from New Jersey, it was making no attempt
to return the nonrecycled residue there. And theoretically, Carbone
could have complied with both flow control ordinances, as Clarkstown's
law required local processing, while New Jersey's required only that any
postprocessing residue be returned to the State. But more fundamentally, even if a nondiscriminatory ordinance conflicts with the law of some
other jurisdiction, that fact would not, in itself, lead to its invalidation.
In the cases Justice O'Connor cites, the statutes at issue served no legitimate state interest that weighed against the burden on interstate commerce their conflicts created. See Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc., 359
U. S. 520, 525 (1959) (mudguards Illinois required on trucks possess no
safety advantage but create new hazards); Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona

we can confidently say that the only business lost as a resultof this ordinance is business lost in Clarkstown, as customers

who had used Carbone's facility drift away in response toany higher fees Carbone may have to institute to afford its
share of city services; but business lost in Clarkstown as aresult of a Clarkstown ordinance is not a burden that offends
the Constitution.This skepticism that protectionism is afoot here is confirmed again when we examine the governmental interestsapparently served by the local law. As mentioned already,
the State and its municipalities need prompt, sanitary trashprocessing, which is imperative whether or not the private
market sees fit to serve this need at an affordable price andto continue doing so dependably into the future. The state
and local governments also have a substantial interest in theflow-control feature to minimize the risk of financing this
service, for while there may be an element of exaggerationin the statement that "[r]esource recovery facilities cannot
be built unless they are guaranteed a supply of discardedmaterial," H. R. Rep. No. 94-1491, p. 10 (1976), there is no
question that a "put or pay" contract of the type Clarkstownsigned will be a significant inducement to accept municipal
responsibility to guarantee efficiency and sanitation in trashprocessing. Waste disposal with minimal environmental
damage requires serious capital investment, id., at 34, andthere are limits on any municipality's ability to incur debt or

ex rel. Sullivan, 325 U. S. 761, 779 (1945) (Arizona statute limiting length
of trains "affords at most slight and dubious advantage, if any" with respect to safety). Here, in contrast, we will see that the municipality's
interests are substantial and that the alternative means for advancing
them are less desirable and potentially as disruptive of interstate commerce. Finally, in any conflict between flow control that reaches only
waste within its jurisdiction and flow control that reaches beyond (requiring waste originating locally to be returned after processing elsewhere),
it may be the latter that should give way for regulating conduct occuring
wholly out of State. See Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York
State Liquor Authority, 476 U. S. 573, 580-582 (1986).

to finance facilities out of tax revenues. Protection of thepublic fisc is a legitimate local benefit directly advanced by

the ordinance and quite unlike the generalized advantage tolocal businesses that we have condemned as protectionist in
the past. See Regan, 84 Mich. L. Rev., at 1120 ("[R]aisingrevenue for the state treasury is a federally cognizable benefit"; protectionism is not); cf. Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill,
Inc. v. Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, 504 U. S. 353,357 (1992) (law protects private, not publicly owned, waste

disposal capacity for domestic use); Philadelphia v. New
Jersey, 437 U. S., at 627, n. 6 (expressing no opinion about
State's power to favor its own residents in granting access
to state-owned resources).17Moreover, flow control offers an additional benefit that

could not be gained by financing through a subsidy derived
from general tax revenues, in spreading the cost of the facil-ity among all Clarkstown residents who generate trash.

The ordinance does, of course, protect taxpayers, including
those who already support the transfer station by patroniz-ing it, from ending up with the tab for making provision for

large-volume trash producers like Carbone, who would relyon the municipal facility when that was advantageous but
opt out whenever the transfer station's price rose above themarket price. In proportioning each resident's burden to
the amount of trash generated, the ordinance has the added
virtue of providing a direct and measurable deterrent to thegeneration of unnecessary waste in the first place. And in

any event it is far from clear that the alternative to flowcontrol (

i. e., subsidies from general tax revenues or municipal bonds) would be less disruptive of interstate commerce

17 The Court did strike down California's depression-era ban on the "importation" of indigent laborers despite the State's protestations that the
statute protected the public fisc from the strain of additional outlays for
poor relief, but the Court stressed the statute's direct effect on immigrants
instead of relying on any indirect effects on the public purse. See Edwards v. California, 314 U. S. 160, 174 (1941).

than flow control, since a subsidized competitor can effec-tively squelch competition by underbidding it.

There is, in short, no evidence that Local Law 9 causesdiscrimination against out-of-town processors, because there
is no evidence in the record that such processors have lostbusiness as a result of it. Instead, we know only that the
ordinance causes the local residents who adopted it to paymore for trash disposal services. But local burdens are not
the focus of the dormant Commerce Clause, and this imposi-tion is in any event readily justified by the ordinance's legitimate benefits in reliable and sanitary trash processing.

* * *
The Commerce Clause was not passed to save the citizensof Clarkstown from themselves. It should not be wielded to

prevent them from attacking their local garbage problemswith an ordinance that does not discriminate between local
and out-of-town participants in the private market for trashdisposal services and that is not protectionist in its purpose
or effect. Local Law 9 conveys a privilege on the municipalgovernment alone, the only market participant that bears
responsibility for ensuring that adequate trash processingservices continue to be available to Clarkstown residents.
Because the Court's decision today is neither compelled byour local processing cases nor consistent with this Court's
reason for inferring a dormant or negative aspect to theCommerce Clause in the first place, I respectfully dissent.

SECURITY SERVICES, INC. v. KMART CORP.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 93-284. Argued February 28, 1994--Decided May 16, 1994
The mileage rate tariff that petitioner motor carrier filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) did not list distances for calculating
charges for shipments, but instead relied upon a Household Goods Carriers' Bureau (HGCB) Mileage Guide for its distance component. The
Mileage Guide states that it may not be used to determine rates unless
the carrier is shown as a "participant" in the Guide. Participants are
listed in a separate HGCB tariff filed with the ICC. When petitioner
failed to pay its fees, HGCB canceled petitioner's participation by supplementing the latter tariff. Sometime later, petitioner contracted to
transport respondent shipper's goods at rates below its filed tariff rates.
Petitioner subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and, as debtorin-possession, asserted that respondent was liable under the Interstate
Commerce Act's filed rate doctrine for undercharges based on the difference between the contract and tariff rates. Respondent refused to pay.
Petitioner sued. The District Court granted summary judgment for respondent, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that the filed
tariff could not support an undercharge claim because it was void under
ICC regulations requiring participation in mileage guides referred to in
a carrier's tariff; that the regulations' retroactive voiding of the tariff
was permissible under ICC v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 467 U. S.
354; and that nonparticipation in the Guide was not a mere technical
defect excused by petitioner's substantial compliance with the filed
rate rule.

Held: A motor carrier in bankruptcy may not rely on tariff rates it has

filed with the ICC, but which are void for nonparticipation under ICC
regulations, as a basis for recovering undercharges. Pp. 435-444.

(a) A bankruptcy trustee for a defunct carrier or the carrier itself as
a debtor-in-possession is entitled to rely on the filed rate doctrine, which
mandates that carriers charge and be paid the rates filed in a tariff, to
collect for undercharges based on effective, filed rates. Maislin Industries, U. S., Inc. v. Primary Steel, Inc., 497 U. S. 116. The ICC's voidfor-nonparticipation regulation, however, invalidates a mileage-based
tariff once cancellation of the carrier's participation in an agent's distance guide is published, as it was here. Such a tariff is incomplete and

freight charge due to the carrier. Petitioner may not recover for undercharges based on filed, but void, rates lacking an essential element.
Pp. 435-440.

(b) The rule of American Trucking, supra, at 361-364, is not apposite
here, for the void-for-nonparticipation regulation does not apply retroactively. Under the regulation, petitioner's tariff reference to the
HGCB Mileage Guide became void as a matter of law and its tariff
filings incomplete on their face when HGCB canceled its participation
in the Guide by filing a supplemental tariff. The transactions with
respondent occurred after that date. Pp. 440-442.

(c) Also inapplicable is the "technical defect" rule. See, e. g.,
Berwind-White Coal Mining Co. v. Chicago & Erie R. Co., 235 U. S.
371, 375. A tariff like petitioner's that refers to another tariff for essential information, which tariff in turn states that the carrier may not
refer to it, does not provide the "adequate notice" of rates to be charged
that the Court's "technical defect" cases require. Pp. 442-443.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether a motor carrierin bankruptcy may recover for undercharges based on tariff

rates that are void as a matter of law under the InterstateCommerce Commission's regulations. We hold that the carrier may not rely on the filed but void tariff.

I
On August 20, 1984, petitioner Security Services, Inc.,(then known as Riss International Corp.) filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission (Commission or ICC) a mileage(or distance) rate tariff having an effective date 30 days later.
The tariff was received, accepted, and filed, and was neverrejected by the ICC. Although the tariff specified rates to
be charged per mile of carriage, it was not complete in itself,for it included no list of distances or map on which a shipper
could rely in calculating charges for a given shipment. Forthe distance component of this mileage-based tariff, petitioner relied upon a Household Goods Carriers' Bureau(HGCB) Mileage Guide, its supplements, and subsequent issues. HGCB is itself not a carrier, but a publisher of dis-tance guides for use in tariff filings. The Mileage Guide is
a 565-page volume of large format, which specifies the dis-tances in miles between various points of origin and destination, and contains maps and supplemental rules. The Mile-age Guide refers shippers to a separate HGCB tariff and its
supplements, filed with the ICC, for a list of the carriers whoare "participants" in the Mileage Guide. A participant is a
carrier who pays HGCB a nominal fee and issues it a validpower of attorney. The first page of HGCB's Mileage Guide
states that it "MAY NOT BE EMPLOYED BY A CAR-RIER AS A GOVERNING PUBLICATION FOR THE
PURPOSE OF DETERMINING INTERSTATE TRANS-PORTATION RATES BASED ON MILEAGE OR DISTANCE, UNLESS CARRIER IS SHOWN AS A PARTICI511us2$49M 11-08-97 20:03:44 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
PANT IN THE ABOVE NAMED TARIFF." HGCB, Mile-age Guide No. 12, p. 1 (Dec. 1982). HGCB filed a tariff supplement to its Mileage Guide, effective February 19, 1985,listing participants and canceling Riss's participation in the
Mileage Guide for failure to pay the nominal participation fee
to HGCB. HGCB treats a power of attorney issued to it asvoid if not renewed by remitting the participation fee within

a reasonable time after cancellation. Riss did not renew.On April 17, 1986, Riss contracted with respondent Kmart
Corporation to transport Kmart's goods at rates specified inthe contract, and from November 3, 1986, to December 29,
1989, Riss transported goods for Kmart under the contract.Riss billed, and Kmart paid, at the contract rate. In November 1989, Riss filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition and
while undergoing reorganization became Security Services.As debtor-in-possession, Security Services billed Kmart for

undercharges (and interest) it was allegedly owed, based onthe difference between the contract rate Kmart paid and the
tariff rates that Riss assertedly had on file with the ICC.Security Services argued that under the Interstate Commerce Act's filed rate doctrine, Kmart was liable for the tar-iff rates filed with the ICC, regardless of any contract rate
negotiated. Kmart refused to pay, and this suit ensued.

The District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania granted summary judgment for Kmart on the ground
that Security Services had no valid tariff on file with the
ICC (without which it could not collect for undercharges),
because HGCB had canceled its participation in the Mileage
Guide. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.
996 F. 2d 1516 (1993). The court reasoned that under ICC
regulations Riss's tariff was void for nonparticipation in the
HGCB Mileage Guide, that Riss had not filed any mileages
of its own to replace its canceled participation, and that the
consequently incomplete and void tariff could not support a
claim for undercharges. Id., at 1524. The court took the
position that, although the ICC regulations operated retroactively to void a filed tariff, that retroactive application was

HGCB Mileage Guide was a mere technical defect excusedby its substantial compliance with the rule requiring it to file
its rates with the Commission. Id., at 1526.We granted certiorari, 510 U. S. 930 (1993), to resolve a

Opinion of the Court
The ICC has authority to "prescribe the form and manner"of tariff filing, $ 10762(b)(1), and the information to be included in tariffs beyond any matter required by statute,$ 10762(a)(1). Each carrier is responsible for ensuring that
it has rates on file with the ICC. $$ 10702, 10762. UnderICC regulations, a carrier has some choice about the form
in which to state its rates, one possibility being a rate basedon mileage. A mileage rate has two components: the rate
per mile and distances between shipping points. 49 CFR$ 1312.30 (1993). A carrier may file the distance portion of
the rate by listing in its own tariff the distances between allrelevant points, by referring to a map attached to its tariff,
or by referring to a separately filed distance guide, such asthe HGCB Mileage Guide. $ 1312.30(c)(1). Petitioner does
not dispute that distance guides are themselves tariffs.Brief for Petitioner 9, n. 4.

2 A carrier may refer to a tariff

filed by another carrier or by an agent only by formally "par-ticipating" in the referenced tariff, which may be done only

by issuing a power of attorney (or concurrence) to the othercarrier or agent. 49 CFR $$ 1312.4(d), 1312.10, 1312.27(e)
(1993). The Commission's void-for-nonparticipation regula-tion provides that "a carrier may not participate in a tariff
issued in the name of another carrier or an agent unless apower of attorney or concurrence has been executed. Absent effective concurrences or powers of attorney, tariffsare void as a matter of law." $ 1312.4(d). Tariff agents like

Opinion of the Court
HGCB are required to identify carriers participating intheir tariffs, by listing their names either in the tariff

containing the mileage guide itself, or in a separate tariff.$$ 1312.13(c), 1312.25. The listings are meant to be kept reasonably current, but are effective until changed. "Revoca-tion or amendment of the power of attorney should be reflected through lawfully published tariff revisions effectiveconcurrently. In the event of failure to so revise the applicable tariff or tariffs, the rates in such tariff or tariffswill remain applicable until lawfully changed." $ 1312.10(a).
That is, cancellation of a power of attorney (whether by
carrier or agent) is accomplished by filing or amending a
tariff. $$ 1312.10(a), 1312.25(d), 1312.17(b). Until such fil-ing or amendment, the carrier's reference to the agent's tariff remains effective, $ 1312.10(a); once the agent's tariff isfiled or amended to note cancellation of the carrier's participation, the carrier's tariff is void as a matter of law (absentadditional filing by the carrier). See $ 1312.4(d).

3 As the

ICC explained, once cancellation of participation is pub-lished, as it was here, the mileage-based tariff is incomplete,

3 The ICC has apparently had a similar rule for many decades. In Cancelation of Participation in Agency Tariffs, 4 Fed. Reg. 4440 (1939), the
Commission made clear that if an agent in whose tariff a carrier participated canceled the carrier's participation for nonpayment of dues or failure
to follow the agent's rules, the carrier could no longer lawfully rely on the
agent's tariffs and had to file its own tariffs to comply with the Act.

438 SECURITY SERVICES, INC. v. KMART CORP.

Opinion of the Court
simplified its tariff filing rules, as by eliminating the require-ment that the actual powers of attorney be filed with the

ICC. See 48 Fed. Reg. 31265, 31266 (1983); see also Revision of Tariff Regulations, All Carriers, 1 I. C. C. 2d 404,
408 (1984). The ICC's rule that "participation" is required,
however, remained in force. See id., at 434; see also 48 Fed.Reg. 31266 (1983) ("The obligation to limit tariff publication

to existing agency relationships remains, however, as a mat-ter of law"). Many shippers and carriers nevertheless responded to the very changes in the market that promptedthe ICC's revision of its rules by ignoring the rates the carriers had filed with the ICC and instead negotiating rates for
carriage lower than the filed rates. As a further result of
competitive pressures, many carriers also went bankrupt.
A number of trustees and debtors-in-possession then attempted to recover as undercharges the difference between
the negotiated and filed rates. Since the market changes
convinced the ICC that strict adherence to the filed rate doctrine was no longer necessary under some circumstances,
Maislin, 497 U. S., at 121, the ICC decided to follow a new
policy of determining, case by case, whether it would be an
"unreasonable practice" under 49 U. S. C. $ 10701 for a carrier (often by then bankrupt) to recover for undercharges
from a shipper who had paid a negotiated, rather than filed,
rate. See National Industrial Transportation League--
Petition to Institute Rulemaking on Negotiated Motor
Common Carrier Rates, 3 I. C. C. 2d 99, 104-108 (1986);
5 I. C. C. 2d 623, 628-634 (1989). In Maislin, we held that
this ICC practice violated the core purposes of the Act,
because "[b]y refusing to order collection of the filed rate
solely because the parties had agreed to a lower rate, the
ICC has permitted the very price discrimination that the
Act by its terms seeks to prevent." 497 U. S., at 130 (citing
49 U. S. C. $ 10741). Thus, we held that any bankruptcy
trustee or debtor-in-possession was entitled to recover for
undercharges based on effective, filed rates.

Opinion of the Court
Petitioner argues that the effect of the void-for-nonparticipation rule is to allow transactions to be governed by
secretly negotiated rates, rather than the publicly filed rates
mandated by the Act. Petitioner would thus have us see the
ICC's recent enforcement of its void-for-nonparticipation
regulation as merely an attempt to evade Maislin and undermine the filed rate doctrine by keeping trustees or debtorsin-possession from recovering for undercharges.

The argument is an odd one.4 The filed rate requirement
mandates that carriers charge the rates filed in a tariff. We
held in Maislin, supra, that the requirement was not subject
to discretionary enforcement when raised against a shipper

4 We have no occasion even to reach its factual predicate, which is vigorously disputed. Security Services argues that the agency failed to
enforce its regulation from amendment in 1984 until 1993. Petitioner
contends that the ICC routinely accepted tariffs containing methods
for computing distances that were not authorized by 49 CFR $ 1312.30(c)
(1993), and that from 1984 to 1988, approximately 40 percent of all motor
carriers filing distance rate tariffs referring to HGCB mileage guides did
so without formally participating in them. See Overland Express, 996 F.
2d, at 359. Petitioner states that the ICC took no action after discovering
these failures to participate. The Government argues that the ICC currently enforces its void-for-nonparticipation rule. It represents, for example, that in fiscal year 1993, the ICC "entered 24 consent decrees with
carriers who had let their participations in mileage guides and other tariffs
lapse, . . . sought and obtained one injunction, and . . . issued an order
pursuant to its broad remedial powers" directing carriers who had let their
participation in the HGCB lapse either to renew their participation or
"strike any reference" to the Mileage Guide in their tariffs. Tr. of Oral
Arg. 42. The Government also disputes the assertion that 40 percent of
carriers referring to an HGCB guide failed to participate in the guide.
The Government and Kmart claim that HGCB found only 111 such failures
among the filings of some 12,800 carriers who referred to HGCB guides,
and that the ICC has taken action for failure to participate. See Household Goods Carriers' Bureau, Inc.--Petition for Cancellation of Tariffs
of Non-Participating Carriers, 9 I. C. C. 2d 378 (1993); National Motor
Freight Traffic Assn.--Petition for Cancellation of Tariffs That Refer to

Opinion of the Court
who had agreed with a carrier to a negotiated rate lowerthan the rate on file. When the carrier's bankruptcy

prompted second thoughts about the wisdom of the agree-ment, the carrier and its creditors obtained the benefit of the
requirement. Here, as in Jasper Wyman, supra, the carrierseeks to escape its burden by recovering for undercharges
even though in effect it had no rates on file because its tarifflacked an essential element. The filed rate rule applied here
to bar the carrier's recovery is the same rule that was ap-plied to bar the shipper's defense. Nor is the rule somehow
more technical or less equitable when applied against Secu-rity Services. It can hardly be gainsaid that a carrier employing distance rates without purporting to be bound bystated distances would be just as well placed to discriminate
among shippers by measuring with rubber instruments as itwould be by charging shippers for a stated distance at mutable rates per mile. While some may debate in other forumsabout the wisdom of the filed rate doctrine, it is enough to
say here that the carriers cannot have it both ways.5

III
Petitioner is left to invoke the limitations on the ICC'sauthority to declare a rate void retroactively, and the "technical defect" rule.6 Neither is availing.

5 Both Justice Thomas, post, at 451, and n. 3, and Justice Ginsburg,
post, at 457-458, argue that the effect of today's ruling is to validate secretly negotiated rates. Indeed, Justice Thomas goes so far as to suggest that our opinion would allow the ICC to circumvent Maislin Industries, U. S., Inc. v. Primary Steel, Inc., 497 U. S. 116 (1990), merely by
declaring that a filed rate is void whenever another rate is negotiated,
post, at 455. But our opinion does nothing of the kind. The Interstate
Commerce Act states that carriers may provide transportation "only if
the rate for the transportation or service is contained in a tariff that is in
effect" under the provisions of the Act, 49 U. S. C. $ 10761(a), and the Act
provides for civil and criminal penalties for failure to maintain such rates,
and to charge or pay them. See generally $$ 11901-11904.

6 Justice Thomas in dissent argues that we ignore petitioner's "broader

argument . . . that the rule is not within the Commission's authority."
See post, at 453, n. 4. But petitioner's question presented was whether

441Cite as: 511 U. S. 431 (1994)
Opinion of the Court

A
The Court of Appeals believed, 996 F. 2d, at 1524-1526,as petitioner now argues, that the void-for-nonparticipation

rule retroactively voids rates and is thus subject to the anal-ysis we applied in

American Trucking, 467 U. S., at 361-364,367. See also Overland Express, 996 F. 2d, at 360. In

American Trucking, we held that the Commission could ret-roactively void effective tariffs ab initio only if the action
"further[s] a specific statutory mandate of the Commission"and is "directly and closely tied to that mandate." 467 U. S.,
at 367. But the rule is not apposite here, for the void-for-nonparticipation regulation does not apply retroactively.
The ICC did not, as in American Trucking, void a rate for aperiod during which an effective rate was filed. The ICC's
regulations operate to void tariffs that would otherwiseapply to future transactions, by providing that the rate becomes inapplicable when the tariff reference to the MileageGuide is canceled, i. e., from the moment at which examination of the tariff filings would show that the carrier's tariffis incomplete, 49 CFR $ 1312.10(a) (1993), after which the
shipper would be unable to rely on the incomplete tariff tocalculate the applicable charges.

7 Transactions occurring

before cancellation of the power of attorney are governed by

"the Interstate Commerce Commission has discretionary authority to retroactively void an effective tariff." Brief for Petitioner i. On the same
page cited by Justice Thomas for petitioner's "broader argument," petitioner in fact describes the ICC rule as "treating [tariffs] as retroactively
void," id., at 20, and petitioner concludes the section by arguing that the
ICC has no power "to retroactively void effective tariffs." Id., at 24.
Petitioner's argument in that section is that the Interstate Commerce
Act "prescribes the remedies available to Kmart," id., at 17, not that the
regulation is ultra vires. Indeed, at oral argument, counsel for petitioner stated that the ICC's void-for-nonparticipation rule "is authorized.
The rule is proper, but the application of the rule . . . is contrary to law."
Tr. of Oral Arg. 17.

7 If a canceled participation is renewed before the effective cancellation

date, participation may be restored on five days' notice by filing an
amended tariff. 49 CFR $ 1312.39(a) (1993).

442 SECURITY SERVICES, INC. v. KMART CORP.

Opinion of the Court
the filed rate; transactions occurring after cancellation wouldhave no filed mileages to which a carrier's per-mile tariff

rates would apply to determine charges due. The regula-tion does not require any ICC "retroactive rejection" of a
filed rate, or indeed any agency action at all. The regulationworks like an expiration date on an otherwise valid tariff in
voiding its future application, in accordance with $ 1312.23(a).Neither regulation works a retroactive voiding. We thus
disagree with the Court of Appeals for the District of Colum-bia Circuit, which held that once a tariff is in effect, a regulation that voids the tariff operates retroactively. Overland
Express, supra, at 360.Here, petitioner's tariff reference to the HGCB Mileage

Guide became void as a matter of law and its tariff filingsincomplete on their face on February 19, 1985, when HGCB
canceled its participation in the Mileage Guide by filing asupplemental tariff. The transactions with Kmart occurred
after that date. B

Nor does the "technical defect" rule apply here. Underour cases, neither procedural irregularity nor unreasonableness nullifies a filed rate; the shipper's remedy for irregular-ity or unreasonable rates is damages. See,

e. g., BerwindWhite Coal Mining Co. v. Chicago & Erie R. Co., 235 U. S.371 (1914); Davis v. Portland Seed Co., 264 U. S. 403 (1924).

In Berwind-White, the Court held that filed tariffs fallingshort of full compliance in stylistic matters were still "adequate to give notice" and so could support a carrier's claimagainst a shipper for charges due. 235 U. S., at 375. In
Davis, the effect of applying the carrier's tariff violated aformer statutory bar to charging less for a longer distance
than for a shorter one over the same route, other thingsbeing equal. The Court rejected the position that the
higher rate was void and the lower rate legally applicable,so that damages would depend upon the difference between
the two, and held that the shipper's remedy was instead to

Opinion of the Court
be measured by its actual damages from having beencharged the higher rate as compared to a reasonable one.

264 U. S., at 424-426.8Unlike the shippers in the "technical defect" cases, the
shipper here could not determine the carrier's rates, sinceunder the regulations, distance tariffs are incomplete once
the carrier's participation in the Mileage Guide has beencanceled by the agent's filing. See 49 CFR $$ 1312.4(d),
1312.10(a), 1312.30 (1993). We are dealing not with a com-plete tariff subject to some blemish independently remediable, but with an incomplete tariff insufficient to support a
reliable calculation of charges. Security Services, however,questions the distinction by arguing that a shipper is unlikely to search for the list of participating carriers and to
determine from the agent's supplemental tariffs that a carri-er's participation has been canceled. Rather, a shipper is

likely only to follow the reference in the carrier's tariff to theHGCB Mileage Guide, and can fully calculate the applicable
charges. But the likelihood or unlikelihood of a shipper'sactually reading all the applicable tariffs is simply irrelevant,
for carriers and shippers alike are charged with construc-tive notice of tariff filings,

Kansas City Southern R. Co. v.
Carl, 227 U. S. 639, 653 (1913); Reiter v. Cooper, 507 U. S., at
266, and the fact that shippers may take shortcuts throughthe filings cannot convert an incomplete tariff into a complete one. In sum, a tariff that refers to another tariff foressential information, which tariff in turn states that the
carrier may not refer to it, does not provide the "adequatenotice" of rates to be charged that our "technical defect"
cases require.

IV
When a carrier relies on a mileage guide filed by anothercarrier or agent, under ICC regulations the carrier must participate in the guide by maintaining a power of attorney;when a carrier fails to maintain its power of attorney and
its participation is canceled by its former agent's filing ofan appropriate tariff, the carrier's tariff is void. Trustees
in bankruptcy and debtors-in-possession may rely on thefiled rate doctrine to collect for undercharges,

Affirmed.
Justice Stevens, concurring.
Although I remain convinced that the Court stumbledbadly in

Maislin Industries, U. S., Inc. v. Primary Steel,
Inc., 497 U. S. 116 (1990), when it rejected the sensible con-struction of the Interstate Commerce Act that had been

adopted by six Courts of Appeals and the agency responsiblefor the Act's enforcement, see

id., at 139 (dissenting opinion),
I agree with the Court's disposition of this case. I writeonly to note that both this case and

Maislin involve a carrier
in bankruptcy seeking to enforce a "filed" rate that was
higher than the one it negotiated with the shipper; in neithercase was there any allegation or evidence that a carrier had

violated the "core purposes of the Act" by charging discrimi-natory rates. See

ante, at 438; 497 U. S., at 130.

Justice Thomas, dissenting.
The Court today concludes that the Interstate CommerceCommission has the authority to promulgate regulations

under which a carrier's duly filed and effective tariff automatically becomes "void" without "any agency action at all,"

comply with certain requirements of the Commission's regu-lations. Because I find nothing in the Interstate Commerce

Act that expressly or impliedly gives the Commission suchauthority, I respectfully dissent.

I
The Interstate Commerce Act (Act), 49 U. S. C. $ 10101et seq., requires motor common carriers such as petitioner

to publish and file with the Interstate Commerce Commis-sion (Commission or ICC) tariffs containing their rates for
transportation or other service under the Commission'sjurisdiction, $ 10762(a)(1), and forbids them to "charge or
receive a different compensation for that transportation orservice than the rate specified in the tariff," $ 10761(a). In
other words, common carriers must charge the filed rate andonly the filed rate. This "filed rate doctrine" admits of few
exceptions. As we have often stated, " `[d]eviation from [thefiled rate] is not permitted upon any pretext. . . . This rule
is undeniably strict and it obviously may work hardship insome cases, but it embodies the policy which has been
adopted by Congress.' " Maislin Industries, U. S., Inc. v.Primary Steel, Inc., 497 U. S. 116, 127 (1990) (quoting Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Maxwell, 237 U. S. 94, 97 (1915)).That much is not in dispute. Cf.

ante, at 435; post, at455. This case turns, not on an application of the filed rate

doctrine per se, but on the extent of the Commission's au-thority to determine what rates and tariffs are "filed" or, in
the terms of the statute, "in effect." 49 U. S. C. $ 10761(a).ICC regulations permit a carrier to file a tariff that incorporates another entity's tariff by reference, provided that thecarrier "participates" in that entity's tariff--that is, provided
that the carrier maintains an effective concurrence or powerof attorney with the publisher of the referenced tariff. See
49 CFR $$ 1312.27(e), 1312.30(c)(4), 1312.4(d) (1993). Theregulatory provision at issue here, the so-called "void-fornonparticipation rule," provides that "[a]bsent effective con511us2$49N 11-08-97 20:03:45 PAGES OPINPGT

Thomas, J., dissenting
currences or powers of attorney, tariffs are void as a matterof law." $ 1312.4(d) (emphasis added).

Taking advantage of the ability to participate in other en-tities' tariffs, petitioner filed a tariff with the Commission
that specified rates per mile for the carriage of various goodsand provided that distances would be calculated using a filed
tariff (often referred to as a distance guide) of the HouseholdGoods Carriers' Bureau (HGCB). See App. 27. The Commission accepted the tariff for filing, and it became effective.At some point between the effective date of petitioner's
tariff and the shipments at issue here, however, petitionerallowed its participation in the HGCB distance guide to
lapse. After transporting goods for respondent under acontract that provided for a rate lower than the filed rate,
petitioner sought to recover the difference between the filedrate and the contract rate in an action for undercharges.
See 49 U. S. C. $ 11706(a). The Third Circuit held the filedrate unenforceable because petitioner had failed to maintain
its participation in the distance guide; its tariff was voidunder 49 CFR $ 1312.4(d) (1993). See 996 F. 2d 1516, 1524
(1993). Petitioner challenges the Commission's authority topromulgate $ 1312.4(d)'s void-for-nonparticipation rule.

II
We considered a similar challenge to the Commission'sstatutory authority in

ICC v. American Trucking Assns.,Inc., 467 U. S. 354 (1984). At issue there was the Commission's power to reject an effective tariff that had been sub-mitted in substantial violation of a rate-bureau agreement.
In determining whether that remedy was within the Com-mission's authority, we asked two questions: first, whether
the Act expressly authorized the agency action in question,see

id., at 361-364; and second, if it did not, whether theremedy nevertheless was "direct[ly] adjunct to the Commission's explicit statutory power"--that is, whether it "fur-ther[ed] a specific statutory mandate" and was "directly and

Thomas, J., dissenting
closely tied to that mandate." Id., at 365, 367 (internal quotation marks omitted). To ascertain whether the void-fornonparticipation rule is within the Commission's power, we
should ask the same questions.

The Court dispenses with the inquiry outlined in American Trucking, however, in the belief that the decision applies
only to cases involving "retroactiv[e]" action by the Commission. Ante, at 440. It is true that in American Trucking,
the Commission's rejection remedy operated retroactively
by voiding the tariff ab initio. Thus, unlike the Commission's action in this case, the remedy affected the charges
for transportation completed before the rejection took place.
The Court, however, misapprehends the scope of our holding.
Far from establishing a special test for retroactive Commission actions, American Trucking merely applied established
principles delimiting the Commission's implied or adjunct
powers. Although the retroactive effect of the proposed
remedy was relevant to our assessment of the Commission's
authority, it did not alter our method of analyzing the statutory challenge to the Commission's power.

Indeed, the decisions upon which we relied in American
Trucking make clear that the methodology we pursued in
that case is not limited to situations involving retroactive
agency action. See American Trucking, supra, at 365-366
(discussing Trans Alaska Pipeline Rate Cases, 436 U. S. 631
(1978), and United States v. Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co., 426
U. S. 500 (1976)). Those cases involved "the Commission's
efforts to place reasonable conditions on the acceptance of
proposed tariffs" as an alternative to suspension of the tariffs pending investigation. 467 U. S., at 365. In Chesapeake & Ohio, the Court considered whether conditions imposed on immediate acceptance of a tariff, although not
expressly authorized by the Act, were impliedly authorized
because they were "directly related to" the Commission's
specific statutory mandate to review, and to suspend if neces511us2$49N 11-08-97 20:03:45 PAGES OPINPGT

sary, tariff rates when filed. 426 U. S., at 514. Similarly,we held in Trans Alaska that, "as in [Chesapeake & Ohio],

the . . . conditions [imposed were] a `. . . direct adjunct tothe Commission's explicit statutory power to suspend rates
pending investigation,' in that they allow[ed] the Commis-sion, in exercising its suspension power, to pursue `a more
measured course' and to `offe[r] an alternative tailored farmore precisely to the particular circumstances' of these
cases." 436 U. S., at 655 (quoting Chesapeake & Ohio,
supra, at 514). In both cases, although the actions had onlyprospective effect, we determined whether they came within

the Commission's implied powers by applying essentially thesame test that we subsequently applied in

American Truck-ing to determine whether the action was within the Commission's implied powers. See 467 U. S., at 367.

III

A

Proceeding with the analysis outlined above, I necessarilybegin with the terms of the statute. The Act expressly

gives the Commission an "impressive array of prescriptivepowers, overcharge assessments, damages remedies, and
civil and criminal fines" to enable it to enforce the filing andsubstantive requirements of the Act.

Id., at 379 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). See also id., at 359-360. Nowhere,however, does the Act give the Commission authority to render a duly filed and effective tariff void upon noncompliancewith a statutory or regulatory requirement.

It might be thought that the most likely source of author-ity to promulgate the void-for-nonparticipation rule is 49
U. S. C. $ 10762(e), which authorizes the Commission to "re-ject" tariffs. American Trucking, however, forecloses reliance on that section. Although $ 10762(e) does not by itsterms apply only to proposed tariffs, we concluded in American Trucking that "unbridled discretion to reject effectivetariffs at any time would undermine restraints placed by

Thomas, J., dissenting
Congress on the Commission's power to suspend a proposedtariff." 467 U. S., at 363.

1 We therefore held that $ 10762(e)

does not apply "to tariffs that have gone into effect." Id.,at 362. The critical point for our analysis of the Commission's express authority under the Act was not that the pro-posed remedy was retroactive, but that it voided an effective
tariff. Our holding was premised on recognition that oncea tariff becomes effective, the Commission's power to nullify
it is limited by the Act.2 Section 10704(b), for example,"which deals with the Commission's authority to cancel

ef-fective tariffs," requires a full Commission hearing before

action is taken. Id., at 363 (emphasis added). The void-for-nonparticipation rule, which nullifies effective tariffs,
provides none of the same procedural protections. Quitethe contrary, it obviates the need for "any agency action at
all." Ante, at 442.

1 The Commission may, pending investigation, suspend a "proposed rate,
classification, rule, or practice at any time for not more than 7 months
beyond the time it would otherwise go into effect." 49 U. S. C. $ 10708(b)
(emphasis added). To do so, the Commission must notify the carrier and
file a notice of suspension with the proposed tariff. If the Commission
fails to act by the end of the suspension period, the tariff goes into effect. Ibid.

2 The D. C. Circuit has linked this conclusion to the concept of retroactivity. See Overland Express, Inc. v. ICC, 996 F. 2d 356, 360 (CADC
1993) ("That a tariff was effective or in effect is what makes rejection
retroactive"), cert. pending, No. 93-883. Cf. Justice Ginsburg's dissent,
post, at 457. I agree with the Court that the void-for-nonparticipation
rule operates only prospectively, see ante, at 441, because the rule does
not affect any transportation provided prior to the lapse in participation
that triggers application of the rule. Nevertheless, because American
Trucking focused, not on retroactivity, but on the Commission's nullification of an effective tariff, the D. C. Circuit properly concluded that the
decisive factor for American Trucking's statutory analysis was the rejection of a tariff after its effective date. In other words, the D. C. Circuit
was correct in stating in the disjunctive that "[t]he Commission is restricted [by American Trucking's holding] whenever it attempts to invalidate (or alter the past effects of) a tariff after the application period has
ended." Overland Express, supra, at 360 (emphasis added).

Thomas, J., dissenting
Perhaps realizing that the Act's provisions relating to thesuspension or rejection of tariffs provide no authority for

the void-for-nonparticipation rule, the Commission reliesinstead on $ 10762(a)(1), which allows the Commission to
"prescribe other information" to be included in tariffs. See
Wonderoast, Inc., 8 I. C. C. 2d 272, 275 (1992). That section,however, says nothing about enforcement of the requirements the Commission imposes, and thus does not--at leastexpressly--expand the scope of the Commission's enforcement mechanisms. Reading it to do so would pose the sameproblem that led us to construe $ 10762(e) narrowly in American Trucking. An unlimited power to reject effective tar-iffs would render the "temporal and procedural constraints"
of other sections of the Act "nugatory" and would permit theCommission to void a tariff "at any time and without any
procedural safeguards." American Trucking, supra, at 363.

B
The absence of explicit authority in the Act does not endour inquiry, because Congress did not limit the Commission

to the powers expressly granted by the Act. See 49 U. S. C.$ 10321(a) ("Enumeration of a power of the Commission in
this subtitle [$$ 10101-11917] does not exclude another powerthe Commission may have in carrying out this subtitle").
See also American Trucking, supra, at 364-365 ("The Com-mission's authority under the [Act] is not bounded by the
powers expressly enumerated in the Act") (citing $ 10321(a)).Thus, we have recognized that in addition to its express powers, the Commission has implied authority to take actionsthat are "direct[ly] adjunct to [its] explicit statutory power."
467 U. S., at 365 (internal quotation marks omitted). TheThird Circuit, which applied the American Trucking analysis of the express and implied authority of the Commission,concluded that the void-for-nonparticipation rule is impliedly
authorized by the Act because it is directly adjunct to theCommission's statutory power under $ 10762(a)(1) to deter511us2$49N 11-08-97 20:03:45 PAGES OPINPGT

mine what information shall be included in tariffs. See 996F. 2d, at 1525-1526. The court failed, however, to consider

the relationship of the rule to the Act as a whole. Viewedin isolation, any remedy designed to enforce a regulation promulgated under the Act might be said to be "adjunct" to therelevant provision of the Act, but

Maislin makes clear thatthe Act must be considered in its entirety. "[A]lthough . . .

the Commission may have discretion to craft appropriateremedies for violations of the statute"--and, possibly, violations of its regulations--the remedy may not "effectivelyrende[r] nugatory the requirements of $$ 10761 and 10762"
and thereby "conflic[t] directly with the core purposes of theAct."

Maislin, 497 U. S., at 133.Viewed in this light, it is clear that far from being "directly

adjunct" to a statutory power of the Commission, the void-for-nonparticipation rule is directly contrary to the Act's
commands and, indeed, to the essence of the filed rate doc-trine. The rule nullifies an effective tariff--that is, one that
has been filed and gone into effect, $ 10762(a)(2), and has notbeen suspended or set aside by the Commission or canceled
by the carrier--without "any agency action at all," ante, at442, and allows to stand a rate negotiated between a carrier
and a shipper but never filed. Like the policy contested in
Maislin, the void-for-nonparticipation rule thus "underminesthe basic structure of the Act" by sanctioning adherence to

an unfiled rate. 497 U. S., at 132.3

3 When the Commission displaces or finds inapplicable a particular filed
rate under other sections of the Act expressly authorizing it to do so, that
rate is generally replaced either by a reasonable rate prescribed by the
Commission, see 49 U. S. C. $ 10704(b), or by a different filed rate. See
Maislin, 497 U. S., at 129, n. 11 ("None of our cases involving a determination by the ICC that the carrier engaged in an unreasonable practice have
required departure from the filed tariff schedule altogether; instead, they
have required merely the application of a different filed tariff"); ICC v.
American Trucking Assns., Inc., 467 U. S. 354, 358 (1984). As Justice
Ginsburg explains, see post, at 457-458, by sanctioning a rate negotiated
by the parties, the Commission, now with the Court's approval, condones

The ability of both carrier and shipper to rely on the tar-iff on file with the Commission is central to the Act's filed

rate provisions. See American Trucking, 467 U. S., at 363-364, n. 7. Therefore, we have consistently held that "[u]nless
and until suspended or set aside, [the rate in the publishedtariff] is made, for all purposes, the legal rate, as between
carrier and shipper." Keogh v. Chicago & Northwestern
R. Co., 260 U. S. 156, 163 (1922). See also Maislin, supra,at 126. This remains the case even if the filed tariff does

not conform with technical filing requirements, see, e. g.,Berwind-White Coal Mining Co. v. Chicago & Erie R. Co.,
235 U. S. 371 (1914), or violates a clear prohibition in thestatute. See

Davis v. Portland Seed Co., 264 U. S. 403(1924) (enforcing tariff rate that unlawfully assessed a higher

charge for a shorter shipment than a longer shipment alongthe same route). As long as a tariff is "received and placed
on file by the Commission without any objection whatever. . . [and] as a matter of fact [is] adequate to give notice,"
that tariff controls. Berwind-White, supra, at 375.There can be no doubt that petitioner's tariff was sufficiently complete "as a matter of fact" to give notice of theapplicable charge. 235 U. S., at 375. Petitioner's tariff was
filed with (and accepted by) the Commission and became ef-fective well before the transportation at issue. It has never
been suspended or set aside by the Commission or canceledby petitioner. At all times it stated that distances would be
determined by reference to the HGCB distance guide--aneffective, duly filed tariff. See App. 27. Neither respondent nor the Commission suggests any confusion or ambiguityas to what charge would be due under petitioner's tariff, but
for the challenged void-for-nonparticipation rule. As Justice Ginsburg explains, see post, at 458-459, petitioner andrespondent could calculate the appropriate charge (if either

desired) just as easily after petitioner's participation lapsed
precisely the "secret" rates and the potential for price discrimination that
the Act was intended to prohibit. See 49 U. S. C. $ 10101(a)(1)(D).

as they could on the date petitioner's tariff was filed. Underour prior filed rate cases, nothing more is required for the

filed tariff to be enforced. IV

The Court's refusal to apply American Trucking's two-step method of statutory analysis leads to a remarkable result: The Court upholds an agency regulation challenged asbeyond the agency's statutory authority without ever considering whether any provision of the statute explicitly au-thorizes the regulation and, if not, whether the regulation
is sufficiently related to an express statutory authority to
be within the agency's implied powers. Indeed, much of
the Court's analysis simply begs the question whether the
Commission had authority to promulgate the void-fornonparticipation rule.4 In the Court's view, petitioner cannot appeal to our precedents governing the enforcement of
filed tariffs because "under the regulations, distance tariffs
are incomplete once the carrier's participation in the [HGCB]
Mileage Guide has been canceled." Ante, at 443. Similarly,
the Court concludes that Maislin requires that petitioner's
tariff not be enforced because petitioner "had no rates on file
because its tariff lacked an essential element." Ante, at 440.
In both instances, the Court assumes that the void-fornonparticipation rule is valid, and that petitioner's tariff
is therefore void. But whether the Commission may deem
the tariff incomplete as a matter of law through 49 CFR

4 In considering the case closed after rejecting the contention that the
void-for-nonparticipation rule is impermissibly retroactive under American Trucking, the Court also ignores petitioner's broader argument. Although petitioner does assert that the void-for-nonparticipation rule is
"retroactive," see Brief for Petitioner 7-16, it also contends more generally
that the rule is not within the Commission's authority. See id., at 17-24.
Specifically, petitioner argues that the Act's "carefully integrated and
complete system of procedures, remedies and penalties" does not "giv[e]
the ICC the broad nullification power set forth in 49 C. F. R. $ 1312.4(d)."

$ 1312.4(d) (1993) is precisely the question we are asked toanswer.

5

In failing even to consider the Commission's authority topromulgate the void-for-nonparticipation rule, and thereby

to void effective tariffs, the Court also fails to consider anylimit the Act might place on that authority. Under the
Court's holding, it would appear that the Commission couldprovide that tariffs will become void, without "any agency
action at all," ante, at 442, because of any number of tech-nical or substantive defects, all in the name of enforcing
the provisions of the Act and ICC regulations. In each in-stance, noncompliance would enable a carrier and preferred
shippers to negotiate more favorable rates with the assur-ance that the rate on file could not be enforced. Until the
Commission examines the carrier's tariff carefully and setsit aside (actions ostensibly made unnecessary by the voidfor-nonparticipation rule), the unfiled rates, rather than thefiled-but-void tariff, will govern the relationship between
the parties.The unfortunate lesson for the Commission is that its
Court-sanctioned voiding power provides the key to unravel-ing the Act's filed rate requirements.

6 If the Court is correct, the Commission's mistake in Maislin was its choice ofremedies, not its objective. In Maislin, the Commission

attempted to justify its policy of refusing to enforce a filedtariff rate where the parties had negotiated a different rate

5 The Court's suggestion that the carrier "cannot have it both ways,"
ante, at 440--that is, that it cannot rely rigidly on the filed rate doctrine
in some cases to enforce the effective rates on file with the Commission
and at the same time not suffer the harsh consequences of the doctrine
when its rate on file is ineffective--presents the same problem. The
Court assumes that there is no filed rate to bind any party in the absence
of current participation in the HGCB distance guide.

6 It is also worth noting that the Court's rationale should apply equally

to other agencies operating under filed rate regimes, such as, for example,
the Federal Communications Commission. See 47 U. S. C. $ 203 (1988 ed.
and Supp. IV).

"as a remedy for the carrier's failure to comply with $ 10762'sdirective to file the negotiated rate with the ICC." 497

U. S., at 131. We rejected that rationale because "$ 10761
requires the carrier to collect the filed rate." Ibid. Under
the reasoning the Court applies today, however, it appears
that the Commission merely chose the wrong remedy: Itshould have promulgated a rule declaring a filed tariff

"void as a matter of law" upon negotiation of a different rate,thereby rendering the filed rate unenforceable. Section
10761 and the filed rate doctrine would not stand in the way,in the Court's view, because the carrier would have no effective rate on file. See ante, at 439-443. In my view, theCourt's reasoning will permit the Commission to turn the
filed rate doctrine on its head.

For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.

Justice Ginsburg, dissenting.
The filed rate doctrine is an integral part of the Interstate
Commerce Act. See 49 U. S. C. $ 10761(a) (a "carrier may
not charge or receive a different compensation . . . than the
rate specified in [its] tariff "). At least since 1915, this Court
has held that the doctrine entitles a carrier to collect the
rate on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission (Commission or ICC), despite a contract, negotiated between shipper and carrier, setting a lower price. See Louisville &
Nashville R. Co. v. Maxwell, 237 U. S. 94, 97 (1915). The
main rule to which we have adhered requires enforcement of
the filed rate unless the Commission either rejects the tariff
because of a formal or substantive defect, before the rate
takes effect, 49 U. S. C. $ 10762(e), or prospectively invalidates a tariff after initiating an investigation and finding the
filed rate unreasonable. $ 10704(b)(1). See Keogh v. Chicago & Northwestern R. Co., 260 U. S. 156, 163 (1922) ("The
legal rights of shipper as against carrier in respect to a rate
are measured by the published tariff. Unless and until

the legal rate, as between carrier and shipper.") (emphasisadded).

Under our filed rate doctrine decisions, even defective fil-ings, including those containing substantively unlawful rates,
see Davis v. Portland Seed Co., 264 U. S. 403, 425 (1924),
normally control. See ICC v. American Trucking Assns.,
Inc., 467 U. S. 354, 363-364, n. 7 (1984); Berwind-White Coal
Mining Co. v. Chicago & Erie R. Co., 235 U. S. 371, 375(1914). A shipper's remedy, when a filed rate imposes an

unlawful charge, ordinarily is confined to actual damages.See

American Trucking, supra, at 364, n. 7 (citing BorenStewart Co. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 196 I. C. C.120 (1933), and

Acme Peat Products, Ltd. v. Akron, C. & Y.
R. Co., 277 I. C. C. 641, 644 (1950)). The ICC may not reject a tariff once accepted and in effect, American Trucking,
supra, at 360-364, unless two conditions are satisfied: First,
the Commission's action must "further a specific statutory
mandate"; second, the action "must be directly and closely
tied to that mandate," 467 U. S., at 367.1

In the 1980's, as the Court recognizes, ante, at 438, many
carriers responded to competitive pressures by ignoring the
tariffs they had filed with the ICC and negotiating with shippers rates for carriage lower than the filed rates. When carrier bankruptcies ensued, trustees asserted claims against

1 American Trucking itself is illustrative. There, the Court upheld the
ICC's authority to reject effective tariffs to deter violations of "rate bureau agreements." Under such agreements, carriers may submit collective rates to the Commission without risking antitrust liability, provided
the agreements conform to specific guidelines set forth in 49 U. S. C.

$ 10706(b)(3). Reasoning that Congress intended the Commission to "play
a key role in holding carriers to the $ 10706(b)(3) guidelines," and that the
nullification in question "is directly aimed at ensuring that motor carriers
comply with the [statutory] guidelines," the Court held the ICC's action
permissible. 467 U. S., at 369, 370. In so holding, the Court stressed that
its "concern over the harshness" of the remedy "is lessened by the significant steps the Commission has taken to ensure that the penalty will not
be imposed unfairly." Id., at 370.

shippers for the difference between the filed rates and thenegotiated rates. Reacting to these claims, the Commission

refused to enforce filed rates when it appeared inequitableto exact from the shipper more than the negotiated lower
price. In Maislin Industries, U. S., Inc. v. Primary Steel,
Inc., 497 U. S. 116 (1990), this Court held the ICC's nonen-forcement policy inconsistent with the Act, explaining:

"[T]he filed rate doctrine . . . forbids as discriminatorythe secret negotiation and collection of rates lower than
the filed rate. By refusing to order collection of thefiled rate solely because the parties had agreed to a

Invoking the filed rate doctrine and case law elaboratingon it, petitioner Security Services seeks to recover undercharges for shipments its predecessor, Riss International,made between November 1986 and December 1989. During
the period for which recovery is sought, the ICC followedthe policy later declared unlawful in Maislin, i. e., the Commission routinely refused to order collection of the filed ratewhere the parties had agreed upon a lower rate. Newly
professing strict adherence to the filed rate doctrine, theICC now contends it may nonetheless void a carrier's tariff,
though valid when filed, and uphold, in place of the filed rate,"secret" contract rates of the kind held invalid in

Maislin.The ICC asserts it may do so for this reason: The carrier

allowed a power of attorney to the Household Goods Carri-ers' Bureau (HGCB) to lapse and neglected to pay a nominal
annual fee to maintain its membership participation inHGCB's Mileage Guide.

Court reasons, "would be just as well placed to discriminate
among shippers by measuring with rubber instruments as it
would be by charging shippers for a stated distance at mutable rates per mile." Ibid.; see also ante, at 443 ("We are
dealing . . . with an incomplete tariff insufficient to support
a reliable calculation of charges.").

It is difficult to regard the Commission's approach, and the
Court's approval of it, as anything other than an end-run
around the filed rate doctrine so recently and firmly upheld
in Maislin. For the distances put forward in the tariff at
issue are not genuinely in doubt. On the contrary, Riss' tariff explicitly incorporated the mileage figures from HGCB's
Mileage Guide. A "close inspection of [HGCB's tariff supplement] might have raised some uncertainty in a shipper's
mind about the propriety of [Riss'] reference to the Guide
[Riss not having paid its dues], but not any uncertainty over
the rate." Overland Express, Inc. v. ICC, 996 F. 2d 356, 361
(CADC 1993) (Silberman, J.), cert. pending, No. 93-883. As
crisply stated in Brizendine v. Cotter & Co., 4 F. 3d 457,
463-464 (CA7 1993) (Flaum, J.), cert. pending, No. 93-1129:

"[S]urely [the carrier's] tariff provided sufficient information about its rates to give notice to its customers
about the price of shipping. Any shipper who consulted
[the carrier's] tariff would find the rate per mile and
would know where to look--namely, to another tariff on
file with the ICC--to determine the distance. . . . [T]he
only way a curious shipper would ever know that [the
carrier] failed to submit a power of attorney to HGCB
would be if it looked up [the] filed rate; saw that the
tariff refers to HGCB's mileage guide; inspected the
mileage guide; noticed that page two of the guide states
that it applies only to participating carriers listed in a
supplement; turned to the supplement; and discovered
that [the carrier's] name was missing."

Were the Commission in fact set on adherence to the filedrate doctrine, carriers like Riss could employ no "rubber instruments." Riss' tariff clearly said that the carrier incor-porated the distances in HGCB's guide. The Commission
could hold Riss to that representation, while imposing asanction for the HGCB membership lapse that did not negate
the filed rate. As Judge Flaum stated in Brizendine:

"Under the filed rate doctrine, even tariffs that containsubstantively unlawful rates or violate ICC filing rules

are not nullities. The shipper must pay the rate on file,and may then sue for the harm, if any, caused by the
tariff 's unlawfulness or irregularity. The enforceabilityof published rates, however defective, discourages the
parties (especially shippers, who may face underchargesuits later) from bargaining for other prices." 4 F. 3d,
at 463 (citations and footnote omitted).
The Court attempts to justify the Commission's applicationof 49 CFR $ 1312.4(d) (1993) as a "void-for-nonparticipation"

rule by equating that rule to a tariff 's expiration date. Ante,at 441-442. But American Trucking held that the Commission generally lacks authority to reject a tariff "once that tariffhas gone into effect." 467 U. S., at 360; see id., at 363, n. 7;
Brizendine, supra, at 463 (American Trucking "makes clearthat a carrier's submitted rate becomes the legal, governing
rate when the ICC accepts it."). As Judge Silberman ex-plained in

Overland Express:

"A regulation that purports to make a tariff[, once effec-tive,] `void' or `ineffective' if a carrier fails to follow a

procedural rule, . . . does not [escape] American Trucking's holding. The Commission is restricted wheneverit attempts to invalidate (or alter the past effects of ) a

tariff after [the tariff 's effective date]. Otherwise,shippers and carriers could not rely confidently on the
rate on file with the Commission, and . . . the filed ratedoctrine would be undermined." 996 F. 2d, at 359-360.

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
Nor does the void-for-nonparticipation rule fit withinthe limited exception described in American Trucking for

actions that directly and closely "further a specific statu-tory mandate," 467 U. S., at 367. The Commission says
that its rule advances the ICC's "mandate to determinethe information that is required to be disclosed in a tariff "
to "ensure that tariffs reveal the applicable rates." Brieffor United States et al. as

Amici Curiae 24 (citing 49U. S. C. $$ 10762(a)(1) and (b)(2)).

3 But as the Seventh Circuit observed:

"[I]t is difficult to see how failure to [maintain in effect]a power of attorney [with the HGCB] would adversely

affect the uniformity of pricing. The true purpose ofthe participation rule may be the facilitation of the ICC's
ability to monitor the shipping market. Requiring thatevery publisher of a tariff list all the other carriers that
have also signed onto that tariff enables the ICC to see,at a glance, how many carriers' rates are being controlled by a single tariff. Publishing that list providesno new information that is not available by inspecting
each carrier's tariff individually--it simply collects it inone convenient place." Brizendine, supra, at 464.

Even if the Commission's action here furthered a statutorymandate, voiding a tariff after its effective date would not
"be directly and closely tied to that mandate" under Ameri-can Trucking. 467 U. S., at 367. Nullification of a rate can
be an extremely harsh remedy, for it "renders the tariff voidab initio. As a result, whatever tariff was in effect prior to
the adoption of the rejected rate becomes the applicable tar3 Subsection 10762(a)(1) states that "[t]he Commission may prescribe
other information that motor common carriers shall include in their tariffs"; subsection (b)(2) provides that "[t]he carriers that are parties to a

acceptance of the tariff with the Commission but are not required to file
a copy of the tariff."

iff for the [relevant] period." Id., at 358 (citation omitted);id., at 361.

4 Accordingly, when the Court upheld the Commission's action in American Trucking as "directly andclosely" tailored to a specific statutory mandate, see n. 1,

supra, it stressed that other less drastic remedies, like ac-tual damages, would have been ineffective checks. See 467
U. S., at 369-370. Here, by contrast, there is no sugges-tion that relief of another kind would not do to check any
cognizable injury to shippers or mileage guide publishers.See

Overland Express, supra, at 362 ("[I]f shippers or mile-age guide publishers were to show that they were injured,

damages presumably would be adequate to remedy the in-jury."); see also

Brizendine, supra, at 465.

It may be that "the Court stumbled badly in Maislin Industries." See ante, at 444 (Stevens, J., concurring). Butthe way to correct that error, if error it was, is to overrule

the unsatisfactory precedent, not to feign fidelity to it whileavoiding its essential meaning.

For the reasons stated here, and more fully developed in
Brizendine and Overland Express, I respectfully dissent.

4 Ironically, the Court's theory in this case--that Riss' tariff was valid
and effective until its participation in the HGCB Mileage Guide lapsed,
see ante, at 442--should result in application of Riss' "prior" effective
tariff, i. e., the same tariff, and not the contract rate, as the Court and the
Commission assume.

DALTON, SECRETARY OF THE NAVY, et al. v.SPECTER

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 93-289. Argued March 2, 1994--Decided May 23, 1994
Respondents filed this action under the Administrative Procedure Act

(APA) and the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (1990
Act), seeking to enjoin the Secretary of Defense (Secretary) from carrying out the President's decision, pursuant to the 1990 Act, to close the
Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. The District Court dismissed the complaint on the alternative grounds that the 1990 Act itself precluded judicial review and that the political question doctrine foreclosed judicial
intervention. In affirming in part and reversing in part, the Court of
Appeals held that judicial review of the closure decision was available
to ensure that the Secretary and the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission (Commission), as participants in the selection process,
had complied with the procedural mandates specified by Congress. The
court also ruled that this Court's recent decision in Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U. S. 788, did not affect the reviewability of respondents'
procedural claims because adjudging the President's actions for compliance with the 1990 Act was a form of constitutional review sanctioned
by Franklin.

Held: Judicial review is not available for respondents' claims.

Pp. 468-477.

(a) A straightforward application of Franklin demonstrates that
respondents' claims are not reviewable under the APA. The actions of
the Secretary and the Commission are not reviewable "final agency
actions" within the meaning of the APA, since their reports recommending base closings carry no direct consequences. See 505 U. S., at 798.
Rather, the action that "will directly affect" bases, id., at 797, is taken
by the President when he submits his certificate of approval of the recommendations to Congress. That the President cannot pick and choose
among bases, and must accept or reject the Commission's closure package in its entirety, is immaterial; it is nonetheless the President, not the
Commission, who takes the final action that affects the military installations. See id., at 799. The President's own actions, in turn, are not
reviewable under the APA because he is not an "agency" under that
Act. See id., at 801. Pp. 468-471.

(b) The Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the President's base
closure decisions are reviewable for constitutionality. Every action by

Syllabus
the President, or by another elected official, in excess of his statutory
authority is not ipso facto in violation of the Constitution, as the Court
of Appeals seemed to believe. On the contrary, this Court's decisions
have often distinguished between claims of constitutional violations and
claims that an official has acted in excess of his statutory authority.
See, e. g., Larson v. Domestic and Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U. S.
682, 691, n. 11; Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579,
585, 587, distinguished. Such decisions demonstrate that the claim at
issue here--that the President violated the 1990 Act's terms by accepting flawed recommendations--is not a "constitutional" claim subject to
judicial review under the exception recognized in Franklin, but is simply a statutory claim. The 1990 Act does not limit the President's discretion in approving or disapproving the Commission's recommendations, require him to determine whether the Secretary or Commission
committed procedural violations in making recommendations, prohibit
him from approving recommendations that are procedurally flawed, or,
indeed, prevent him from approving or disapproving recommendations
for whatever reason he sees fit. Where, as here, a statute commits
decisionmaking to the President's discretion, judicial review of his decision is not available. See, e. g., Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v.
Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 113-114. Pp. 471-476.

(c) Contrary to respondents' contention, failure to allow judicial review here does not result in the virtual repudiation of Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, and nearly two centuries of constitutional adjudication. The judicial power conferred by Article III is upheld just as
surely by withholding judicial relief where Congress has permissibly
foreclosed it, as it is by granting such relief where authorized by the
Constitution or by statute. Pp. 476-477.

466 DALTON v. SPECTER

Opinion of the Court
In April 1991, the Secretary recommended the closure or
realignment of a number of military installations, including
the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. After holding public
hearings in Washington, D. C., and Philadelphia, the Commission recommended closure or realignment of 82 bases.
The Commission did not concur in all of the Secretary's recommendations, but it agreed that the Philadelphia Naval
Shipyard should be closed. In July 1991, President Bush
approved the Commission's recommendations, and the House
of Representatives rejected a proposed joint resolution of
disapproval by a vote of 364 to 60.

Two days before the President submitted his certification of approval to Congress, respondents filed this action
under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C.

$ 701 et seq., and the 1990 Act. Their complaint contained
three counts, two of which remain at issue.3 Count I alleged
that the Secretaries of Navy and Defense violated substantive and procedural requirements of the 1990 Act in recommending closure of the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. Count
II made similar allegations regarding the Commission's recommendations to the President, asserting specifically that,
inter alia, the Commission used improper criteria, failed to
place certain information in the record until after the close
of public hearings, and held closed meetings with the Navy.

The United States District Court for the Eastern District
of Pennsylvania dismissed the complaint in its entirety, on
the alternative grounds that the 1990 Act itself precluded

3 Respondents' third count alleged that petitioners had violated the due
process rights of respondent shipyard employees and respondent unions.
In its initial decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit held that the shipyard employees and unions had no protectible
property interest in the shipyard's continued operation and thus had failed
to state a claim under the Due Process Clause. Specter v. Garrett, 971
F. 2d 936, 955-956 (1992). Respondents did not seek further review of
that ruling, and it is not at issue here.

judicial review and that the political question doctrine foreclosed judicial intervention. Specter v. Garrett, 777 F. Supp.
1226 (1991). A divided panel of the United States Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed in part and reversed
in part. Specter v. Garrett, 971 F. 2d 936 (1992) (Specter I).
The Court of Appeals first acknowledged that the actions
challenged by respondents were not typical of the "agency
actions" reviewed under the APA, because the 1990 Act contemplates joint decisionmaking among the Secretary, Commission, President, and Congress. Id., at 944-945. The
Court of Appeals then reasoned that because respondents
sought to enjoin the implementation of the President's decision, respondents (who had not named the President as a
defendant) were asking the Court of Appeals "to review a
presidential decision." Id., at 945. The Court of Appeals
decided that there could be judicial review of the President's
decision because the "actions of the President have never
been considered immune from judicial review solely because
they were taken by the President." Ibid. It held that certain procedural claims, such as respondents' claim that the
Secretary failed to transmit to the Commission all of the information he used in making his recommendations, and their
claim that the Commission did not hold public hearings as
required by the Act, were thus reviewable. Id., at 952-953.
The dissenting judge took the view that the 1990 Act precluded judicial review of all statutory claims, procedural and
substantive. Id., at 956-961.

Shortly after the Court of Appeals issued its opinion, we
decided Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U. S. 788 (1992), in
which we addressed the existence of "final agency action" in
a suit seeking APA review of the decennial reapportionment
of the House of Representatives. The Census Act requires
the Secretary of Commerce to submit a census report to the
President, who then certifies to Congress the number of
Representatives to which each State is entitled pursuant to

468 DALTON v. SPECTER

Opinion of the Court
a statutory formula. We concluded both that the Secretary's report was not "final agency action" reviewable under
the APA, and that the APA does not apply to the President.
Id., at 796-801. After we rendered our decision in Franklin, petitioners sought our review in this case. Because of
the similarities between Franklin and this case, we granted
the petition for certiorari, vacated the judgment of the Court
of Appeals, and remanded for further consideration in light
of Franklin. O'Keefe v. Specter, 506 U. S. 969 (1992).

On remand, the same divided panel of the Court of Appeals adhered to its earlier decision, and held that Franklin
did not affect the reviewability of respondents' procedural
claims. Specter v. Garrett, 995 F. 2d 404 (1993) (Specter II).
Although apparently recognizing that APA review was unavailable, the Court of Appeals felt that adjudging the President's actions for compliance with the 1990 Act was a "form
of constitutional review," and that Franklin sanctioned such
review. 995 F. 2d, at 408-409. Petitioners again sought
our review, and we granted certiorari. 510 U. S. 930 (1993).
We now reverse.

I

We begin our analysis on common ground with the Court
of Appeals. In Specter II, that court acknowledged, at least
tacitly, that respondents' claims are not reviewable under
the APA. 995 F. 2d, at 406. A straightforward application of Franklin to this case demonstrates why this is so.
Franklin involved a suit against the President, the Secretary of Commerce, and various public officials, challenging
the manner in which seats in the House of Representatives
had been apportioned among the States. 505 U. S., at 790.
The plaintiffs challenged the method used by the Secretary
of Commerce in preparing her census report, particularly
the manner in which she counted federal employees working overseas. The plaintiffs raised claims under both the
APA and the Constitution. In reviewing the former, we

Opinion of the Court
first sought to determine whether the Secretary's action,in submitting a census report to the President, was "final"

for purposes of APA review. (The APA provides for judi-cial review only of "

final agency action." 5 U. S. C. $ 704
(emphasis added).) Because the President reviewed (and
could revise) the Secretary's report, made the apportion-ment calculations, and submitted the final apportionment

report to Congress, we held that the Secretary's report was"not final and therefore not subject to review." 505 U. S.,
at 798.We next held that the President's actions were not reviewable under the APA, because the President is not an
"agency" within the meaning of the APA. Id., at 801 ("As
the APA does not expressly allow review of the President's
actions, we must presume that his actions are not subject to
its requirements"). We thus concluded that the reapportionment determination was not reviewable under the standards of the APA. Ibid. In reaching our conclusion, we
noted that the "President's actions may still be reviewed for
constitutionality." Ibid. (citing Youngstown Sheet & Tube
Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579 (1952), and Panama Refining Co.
v. Ryan, 293 U. S. 388 (1935)).

In this case, respondents brought suit under the APA,
alleging that the Secretary and the Commission did not
follow the procedural mandates of the 1990 Act. But here,
as in Franklin, the prerequisite to review under the APA--
"final agency action"--is lacking. The reports submitted by
the Secretary and the Commission, like the report of the
Secretary of Commerce in Franklin, "carr[y] no direct
consequences" for base closings. 505 U. S., at 798. The
action that "will directly affect" the military bases, id., at
797, is taken by the President, when he submits his certification of approval to Congress. Accordingly, the Secretary's
and Commission's reports serve "more like a tentative recommendation than a final and binding determination." Id.,
at 798. The reports are, "like the ruling of a subordinate

official, not final and therefore not subject to review." Ibid.(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The actions of the President, in turn, are not reviewable under theAPA because, as we concluded in

Franklin, the President is
not an "agency." See id., at 800-801.

Respondents contend that the 1990 Act differs signifi-cantly from the Census Act at issue in

Franklin, and that
our decision in Franklin therefore does not control thequestion whether the Commission's actions here are final.

Respondents appear to argue that the President, under the1990 Act, has little authority regarding the closure of bases.
See Brief for Respondents 29 (pointing out that the 1990
Act does not allow "the President to ignore, revise or amend
the Commission's list of closures. He is only permitted to
accept or reject the Commission's closure package in its
entirety"). Consequently, respondents continue, the Commission's report must be regarded as final. This argument
ignores the ratio decidendi of Franklin. See 505 U. S., at
800-801.

First, respondents underestimate the President's authority under the Act, and the importance of his role in the base
closure process. Without the President's approval, no bases
are closed under the Act, see $ 2903(e)(5); the Act, in turn,
does not by its terms circumscribe the President's discretion
to approve or disapprove the Commission's report. Cf. id.,
at 799. Second, and more fundamentally, respondents' argument ignores "[t]he core question" for determining finality:
"whether the agency has completed its decisionmaking process, and whether the result of that process is one that will
directly affect the parties." Id., at 797. That the President
cannot pick and choose among bases, and must accept or reject the entire package offered by the Commission, is immaterial. What is crucial is the fact that "[t]he President, not
the [Commission], takes the final action that affects" the military installations. Id., at 799. Accordingly, we hold that
the decisions made pursuant to the 1990 Act are not review511us2$50H 11-03-97 21:51:12 PAGES OPINPGT

able under the APA. Accord, Cohen v. Rice, 992 F. 2d 376(CA1 1993).

Although respondents apparently sought review exclu-sively under the APA,

4 the Court of Appeals nevertheless

sought to determine whether non-APA review, based oneither common law or constitutional principles, was available.

It focused, moreover, on whether the President's actionsunder the 1990 Act were reviewable, even though respondents did not name the President as a defendant. The Courtof Appeals reasoned that because respondents sought to enjoin the implementation of the President's decision, the legal-ity of that decision would determine whether an injunction
should issue. See Specter II, 995 F. 2d, at 407; Specter I,971 F. 2d, at 936. In this rather curious fashion, the case
was transmuted into one concerning the reviewability ofPresidential decisions.

II
Seizing upon our statement in Franklin that Presidentialdecisions are reviewable for constitutionality, the Court of

Appeals asserted that "there is a constitutional aspect to theexercise of judicial review in this case--an aspect grounded
in the separation of powers doctrine." Specter II, supra,at 408. It reasoned, relying primarily on

Youngstown
Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579 (1952), that when-ever the President acts in excess of his statutory authority,

he also violates the constitutional separation-of-powers doc-trine. Thus, judicial review must be available to determine
whether the President has statutory authority "for whateveraction" he takes. 995 F. 2d, at 409. In terms of this case,
the Court of Appeals concluded that the President's statu-tory authority to close and realign bases would be lacking
if the Secretary and Commission violated the procedural

requirements of the Act in formulating their recommendations. Ibid.

Accepting for purposes of decision here the propriety of
examining the President's actions, we nonetheless believe
that the Court of Appeals' analysis is flawed. Our cases do
not support the proposition that every action by the President, or by another executive official, in excess of his statutory authority is ipso facto in violation of the Constitution.
On the contrary, we have often distinguished between claims
of constitutional violations and claims that an official has
acted in excess of his statutory authority. See, e. g., Wheeldin v. Wheeler, 373 U. S. 647, 650-652 (1963) (distinguishing
between "rights which may arise under the Fourth Amendment" and "a cause of action for abuse of the [statutory] subpoena power by a federal officer"); Bivens v. Six Unknown
Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, 396-397 (1971) (distinguishing between "actions contrary to [a] constitutional
prohibition," and those "merely said to be in excess of the
authority delegated . . . by the Congress").

In Larson v. Domestic and Foreign Commerce Corp., 337
U. S. 682, 691, n. 11 (1949), for example, we held that sovereign immunity would not shield an executive officer from suit
if the officer acted either "unconstitutionally or beyond his
statutory powers." (Emphasis added.) If all executive actions in excess of statutory authority were ipso facto unconstitutional, as the Court of Appeals seemed to believe, there
would have been little need in Larson for our specifying unconstitutional and ultra vires conduct as separate categories.
See also Dugan v. Rank, 372 U. S. 609, 621-622 (1963); Harmon v. Brucker, 355 U. S. 579, 581 (1958) ("In keeping with
our duty to avoid deciding constitutional questions presented
unless essential to proper disposition of a case, we look first
to petitioners' non-constitutional claim that respondent
[Secretary of the Army] acted in excess of powers granted
him by Congress" (emphasis added)).

Opinion of the Court
Our decision in Youngstown, supra, does not suggest adifferent conclusion. In Youngstown, the Government disclaimed any statutory authority for the President's seizureof steel mills. See 343 U. S., at 585 ("[W]e do not understand the Government to rely on statutory authorization forthis seizure"). The only basis of authority asserted was the
President's inherent constitutional power as the Executiveand the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.

Id., at587. Because no statutory authority was claimed, the case

necessarily turned on whether the Constitution authorizedthe President's actions.

Youngstown thus involved the conceded absence of any statutory authority, not a claim that
the President acted in excess of such authority. The casecannot be read for the proposition that an action taken by

the President in excess of his statutory authority necessarilyviolates the Constitution.

5

The decisions cited above establish that claims simply alleging that the President has exceeded his statutory authority are not "constitutional" claims, subject to judicial review

5 Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U. S. 388 (1935), the other case
(along with Youngstown) cited in Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U. S. 788
(1992), as an example of when we have reviewed the constitutionality
of the President's actions, likewise did not involve a claim that the President acted in excess of his statutory authority. Panama Refining involved the National Industrial Recovery Act, which delegated to the President the authority to ban interstate transportation of oil produced in
violation of state production and marketing limits. See 293 U. S., at 406.
We struck down an Executive Order promulgated under that Act not because the President had acted beyond his statutory authority, but rather
because the Act unconstitutionally delegated Congress' authority to the
President. See id., at 430. As the Court pointed out, we were "not dealing with action which, appropriately belonging to the executive province,
is not the subject of judicial review, or with the presumptions attaching to executive action. To repeat, we are concerned with the question
of the delegation of legislative power." Id., at 432 (footnote omitted).
Respondents have not alleged that the 1990 Act in itself amounts to an
unconstitutional delegation of authority to the President.

Opinion of the Court
under the exception recognized in Franklin.6 As this casedemonstrates, if every claim alleging that the President exceeded his statutory authority were considered a constitu-tional claim, the exception identified in Franklin would be
broadened beyond recognition. The distinction betweenclaims that an official exceeded his statutory authority, on
the one hand, and claims that he acted in violation of theConstitution, on the other, is too well established to permit
this sort of evisceration.So the claim raised here is a statutory one: The President
is said to have violated the terms of the 1990 Act by accept-ing procedurally flawed recommendations. The exception
identified in Franklin for review of constitutional claimsthus does not apply in this case. We may assume for the
sake of argument that some claims that the President hasviolated a statutory mandate are judicially reviewable outside the framework of the APA. See Dames & Moore v.Regan, 453 U. S. 654, 667 (1981). But longstanding authority holds that such review is not available when the statutein question commits the decision to the discretion of the
President.As we stated in

Dakota Central Telephone Co. v. SouthDakota ex rel. Payne, 250 U. S. 163, 184 (1919), where a claim

"concerns not a want of [Presidential] power, but a mereexcess or abuse of discretion in exerting a power given,
it is clear that it involves considerations which are be-yond the reach of judicial power. This must be since,
as this court has often pointed out, the judicial may notinvade the legislative or executive departments so as to
correct alleged mistakes or wrongs arising from as-serted abuse of discretion."

6 As one commentator has observed, in cases in which the President
concedes, either implicitly or explicitly, that the only source of his authority is statutory, no "constitutional question whatever" is raised.
J. Choper, Judicial Review and the National Political Process 316 (1980).
Rather, "the cases concern only issues of statutory interpretation." Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
In a case analogous to the present one, Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103
(1948), an airline denied a certificate from the Civil Aeronau-tics Board to establish an international air route sought judicial review of the denial. Although the Civil Aeronautics
Act, 49 U. S. C. $ 646 (1946 ed.), generally allowed for judicialreview of the Board's decisions, and did not explicitly exclude

judicial review of decisions involving international routes ofdomestic airlines, we nonetheless held that review was unavailable. 333 U. S., at 114.In reasoning pertinent to this case, we first held that the
Board's certification was not reviewable because it was notfinal until approved by the President. See

id., at 112-114
("[O]rders of the Board as to certificates for overseas or foreign air transportation are not mature and are therefore notsusceptible of judicial review at any time before they are

finalized by Presidential approval"). We then concludedthat the President's decision to approve or disapprove the
orders was not reviewable, because "the final orders embodyPresidential discretion as to political matters beyond the
competence of the courts to adjudicate." See id., at 114.We fully recognized that the consequence of our decision was
to foreclose judicial review:

"The dilemma faced by those who demand judicial review of the Board's order is that before Presidentialapproval it is not a final determination . . . and after

Presidential approval the whole order, both in what
is approved without change as well as in amendmentswhich he directs, derives its vitality from the exercise

of unreviewable Presidential discretion." Id., at 113
(emphasis added).

Although the President's discretion in Waterman S. S. Corp.
derived from the Constitution, we do not believe the result
should be any different when the President's discretion derives from a valid statute. See Dakota Central Telephone

Opinion of the Court
Co., supra, at 184; United States v. George S. Bush & Co.,310 U. S. 371, 380 (1940).

The 1990 Act does not at all limit the President's discre-tion in approving or disapproving the Commission's recommendations. See $ 2903(e); see also Specter II, 995 F. 2d,at 413 (Alito, J., dissenting). The Third Circuit seemed to
believe that the President's authority to close bases de-pended on the Secretary's and Commission's compliance with
statutory procedures. This view of the statute, however,incorrectly conflates the duties of the Secretary and Commission with the authority of the President. The President'sauthority to act is not contingent on the Secretary's and
Commission's fulfillment of all the procedural requirementsimposed upon them by the 1990 Act. Nothing in $ 2903(e)
requires the President to determine whether the Secretaryor Commission committed any procedural violations in making their recommendations, nor does $ 2903(e) prohibit thePresident from approving recommendations that are procedurally flawed. Indeed, nothing in $ 2903(e) prevents thePresident from approving or disapproving the recommendations for whatever reason he sees fit. See $ 2903(e); Specter
II, 995 F. 2d, at 413 (Alito, J., dissenting).How the President chooses to exercise the discretion Congress has granted him is not a matter for our review. SeeWaterman S. S. Corp., supra; Dakota Central Telephone Co.,
supra, at 184. As we stated in George S. Bush & Co., supra,at 380, "[n]o question of law is raised when the exercise of
[the President's] discretion is challenged."

III
In sum, we hold that the actions of the Secretary and theCommission cannot be reviewed under the APA because they

are not "final agency actions." The actions of the Presidentcannot be reviewed under the APA because the President is
not an "agency" under that Act. The claim that the Presi-dent exceeded his authority under the 1990 Act is not a con511us2$50H 11-03-97 21:51:12 PAGES OPINPGT

stitutional claim, but a statutory one. Where a statute, suchas the 1990 Act, commits decisionmaking to the discretion

of the President, judicial review of the President's decisionis not available.

Respondents tell us that failure to allow judicial review
here would virtually repudiate Marbury v. Madison, 1Cranch 137 (1803), and nearly two centuries of constitutional

adjudication. But our conclusion that judicial review is notavailable for respondents' claim follows from our interpretation of an Act of Congress, by which we and all fed-eral courts are bound. The judicial power of the United
States conferred by Article III of the Constitution is upheldjust as surely by withholding judicial relief where Congress
has permissibly foreclosed it, as it is by granting such relief
where authorized by the Constitution or by statute.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Reversed.

Justice Blackmun, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.

I did not join the majority opinion in Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U. S. 788 (1992), and would not extend that unfortunate holding to the facts of this case. I nevertheless
agree that the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act
of 1990 "preclud[es] judicial review of a base-closing decision," post, at 484, and accordingly join Justice Souter's
opinion.

I write separately to underscore what I understand to be
the limited reach of today's decision. The majority and concurring opinions conclude that the President acts within his
unreviewable discretion in accepting or rejecting a recommended base-closing list, and that an aggrieved party may
not enjoin closure of a duly selected base as a result of alleged error in the decisionmaking process. This conclusion,
however, does not foreclose judicial review of a claim, for
example, that the President added a base to the Defense

Opinion of Souter, J.
Base Closure and Realignment Commission's (Commission's)list in contravention of his statutory authority. Nor does

either opinion suggest that judicial review would be unavail-able for a timely claim seeking direct relief from a procedural
violation, such as a suit claiming that a scheduled meeting of
the Commission should be public, see $ 2903(d), note follow-ing 10 U. S. C. $ 2687 (1988 ed., Supp. IV), or that the Secretary of Defense should publish the proposed selection crite-ria and provide an opportunity for public comment, $$ 2903(b)
and (c). Such a suit could be timely brought and adjudicatedwithout interfering with Congress' intent to preclude judicial
"cherry pick[ing]" or frustrating the statute's expedited deci-sionmaking schedule. See

post, at 481. I also do not understand the majority's Franklin analysis to foreclose such a
suit, since a decision to close the Commission's hearing, for
example, would " `directly affect' " the rights of interested
parties independent of any ultimate Presidential review.
See ante, at 470; cf. FCC v. ITT World Communications,
Inc., 466 U. S. 463 (1984).

With the understanding that neither a challenge to ultra
vires exercise of the President's statutory authority nor a
timely procedural challenge is precluded, I join Justice Souter's concurrence and Part II of the opinion of the Court.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Blackmun, Justice Stevens, and Justice Ginsburg join, concurring in
part and concurring in the judgment.

I join Part II of the Court's opinion because I think it is
clear that the President acted wholly within the discretion
afforded him by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment
Act of 1990 (Act), and because respondents pleaded no constitutional claim against the President, indeed, no claim against
the President at all. As the Court explains, the Act grants
the President unfettered discretion to accept the Commission's base-closing report or to reject it, for a good reason,
a bad reason, or no reason. See ante, at 476.

Opinion of Souter, J.
It is not necessary to reach the question the Court answersin Part I, whether the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission's (Commission's) report is final agency ac-tion, because the text, structure, and purpose of the Act compel the conclusion that judicial review of the Commission's
or the Secretary's compliance with it is precluded. Thereis, to be sure, a "strong presumption that Congress did not

mean to prohibit all judicial review." Bowen v. Michigan
Academy of Family Physicians, 476 U. S. 667, 672 (1986)
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). But al-though no one feature of the Act, taken alone, is enough to

overcome that strong presumption, I believe that the combi-nation present in this unusual legislative scheme suffices.

In adopting the Act, Congress was intimately familiar with
repeated, unsuccessful, efforts to close military bases in arational and timely manner. See generally Defense Base

Closure and Realignment Commission, Report to the President 1991.1 That history of frustration is reflected in the
Act's text and intricate structure, which plainly express congressional intent that action on a base-closing package be
quick and final, or no action be taken at all.

At the heart of the distinctive statutory regime, Congress
placed a series of tight and rigid deadlines on administrative
review and Presidential action, embodied in provisions for
three biennial rounds of base closings, in 1991, 1993, and 1995
(the "base-closing years"), $$ 2903(b) and (c), note following
10 U. S. C. $ 2687 (1988 ed., Supp. IV), with unbending deadlines prescribed for each round. The Secretary is obliged to
forward base-closing recommendations to the Commission,

no later, respectively, than April 15, 1991, March 15, 1993,and March 15, 1995. $ 2903(c). The Comptroller General

must submit a report to Congress and the Commission eval-uating the Secretary's recommendations by April 15 of each
base-closing year. $ 2903(d)(5). The Commission must thentransmit a report to the President setting out its own recommendations by July 1 of each of those years. $ 2903(d)(2).And in each such year, the President must, no later than
July 15, either approve or disapprove the Commission's rec-ommendations. $ 2903(e)(1). If the President disapproves
the Commission's report, the Commission must send thePresident a revised list of recommended base closings, no
later than August 15. $ 2903(e)(3). In that event, the Presi-dent will have until September 1 to approve the Commission's revised report; if the President fails to approve thereport by that date, then no bases will be closed that year.

$ 2903(e)(5). If, however, the President approves a Commis-sion report within either of the times allowed, the report
becomes effective unless Congress disapproves the Presi-dent's decision by joint resolution (passed according to provisions for expedited and circumscribed internal procedures)within 45 days. $$ 2904(b)(1)(A), 2908.

2

The Act requires that a decision about a base-closing pack-age, once made, be implemented promptly. Once Congress

has declined to disapprove the President's base-closing de-cision, the Secretary of Defense "shall . . . close all military installations recommended for closure." $ 2904(a).The Secretary is given just two years after the President's
transmittal to Congress to begin the complicated process ofclosing the listed bases and must complete each base-closing
round within six years of the President's transmittal. See$$ 2904, 2905.

2 To enable Congress to perform this prompt review, the Act requires
the Secretary, the Comptroller General, and the Commission to provide
Congress with information prior to the completion of Executive Branch
review. See $$ 2903(a)(1), (b)(2), (c)(1), and (d)(3).

481Cite as: 511 U. S. 462 (1994)
Opinion of Souter, J.
It is unlikely that Congress would have insisted on such atimetable for decision and implementation if the base-closing

package would be subject to litigation during the periodsallowed, in which case steps toward closing would either
have to be delayed in deference to the litigation, or the litigation might be rendered moot by completion of the closingprocess. That unlikelihood is underscored by the provision

for disbanding the Commission at the end of each base-closing decision round, and for terminating it automatically
at the end of 1995, whether or not any bases have been se-lected to be closed. If Congress intended judicial review of
individual base-closing decisions, it would be odd indeed to
disband biennially, and at the end of three rounds to terminate, the only entity authorized to provide further review
and recommendations.

The point that judicial review was probably not intended
emerges again upon considering the linchpin of this unusual
statutory scheme, which is its all-or-nothing feature. The
President and Congress must accept or reject the biennial
base-closing recommendations as a single package. See

$$ 2903(e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4) (as to the President); $$ 2908(a)(2)
and (d)(2) (as to Congress). Neither the President nor Congress may add a base to the list or "cherry pick" one from
it. This mandate for prompt acceptance or rejection of the
entire package of base closings can only represent a considered allocation of authority between the Executive and
Legislative Branches to enable each to reach important, but
politically difficult, objectives. Indeed, the wisdom and ultimate political acceptability of a decision to close any one base
depends on the other closure decisions joined with it in a
given package, and the decisions made in the second and
third rounds just as surely depend (or will depend) on the
particular content of the package or packages of closings that
will have preceded them. If judicial review could eliminate
one base from a package, the political resolution embodied in
that package would be destroyed; if such review could elimi511us2$50M 11-03-97 21:51:12 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Souter, J.
nate an entire package, or leave its validity in doubt whena succeeding one had to be devised, the political resolution

necessary to agree on the succeeding package would be ren-dered the more difficult, if not impossible. The very reasons
that led Congress by this enactment to bind its hands fromuntying a package, once assembled, go far to persuade me
that Congress did not mean the courts to have any suchpower through judicial review.

When combined with these strict timetables for decision,the temporary nature of the Commission, the requirement
for prompt implementation, and the all-or-nothing base-closing requirement at the core of the Act, two secondary
features of the legislation tend to reinforce my conclusionthat judicial review was not intended. First, the Act provides nonjudicial opportunities to assess any procedural(or other) irregularities. The Commission and the Comptroller General review the Secretary's recommendations, see$$ 2903(d)(5), 2903(d)(3), and each can determine whether
the Secretary has provided adequate information for re-viewing the soundness of his recommendations.

3 The President may, of course, also take procedural irregularitiesinto account in deciding whether to seek new recommendations from the Commission, or in deciding not to approvethe Commission's recommendations altogether. And, ultimately, Congress may decide during its 45-day review periodwhether procedural failings call the Presidentially approved
recommendations so far into question as to justify their sub-stantive rejection.

4

3 Petitioners represent, indeed, that as to the round in question, the
Comptroller General reported to Congress on procedural irregularities
(as well as substantive differences of opinion) and requested additional
information from the Secretary (which was provided). See Reply Brief
for Petitioners 16, n. 12.

4 In approving the base closings for 1991, Congress was apparently well

aware of claims of procedural shortcomings, but nonetheless chose not
to disapprove the list. See Department of Defense Appropriations Act,
1992, Pub. L. 102-172, $ 8131, 105 Stat. 1208.

Opinion of Souter, J.
Second, the Act does make express provision for judicialreview, but only of objections under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 83 Stat. 852, as amended,42 U. S. C. $ 4321

et seq., to implementation plans for a base
closing, and only after the process of selecting a package of
bases for closure is complete. Because NEPA review dur-ing the base-closing decision process had stymied or delayed

earlier efforts,5 the Act, unlike prior legislation addressedto base closing, provides that NEPA has no application at
all until after the President has submitted his decision toCongress and the process of selecting bases for closure has
been completed. See $ 2905(c)(1). NEPA then applies onlyto claims arising out of actual disposal or relocation of base
property, not to the prior decision to choose one base oranother for closing. $ 2905(c)(2). The Act by its terms allows for "judicial review, with respect to any requirement of
[NEPA]" made applicable to the Act by $ 2905(c)(2), but requires the action to be initiated within 60 days of the Defense
Department's act or omission as to the closing of a base.

$ 2905(c)(3). This express provision for judicial review of
certain NEPA claims within a narrow time frame supports
the conclusion that the Act precludes judicial review of other
matters, not simply because the Act fails to provide expressly for such review, but because Congress surely would
have prescribed similar time limits to preserve its considered
schedules if review of other claims had been intended.

In sum, the text, structure, and purpose of the Act clearly
manifest congressional intent to confine the base-closing selection process within a narrow time frame before inevitable
political opposition to an individual base closing could become overwhelming, to ensure that the decisions be implemented promptly, and to limit acceptance or rejection to a
package of base closings as a whole, for the sake of political
feasibility. While no one aspect of the Act, standing alone,

would suffice to overcome the strong presumption in favorof judicial review, this structure (combined with the Act's

provision for Executive and congressional review, and itsrequirement of time-constrained judicial review of implementation under NEPA) can be understood no other way than asprecluding judicial review of a base-closing decision under
the scheme that Congress, out of its doleful experience, choseto enact. I conclude accordingly that the Act forecloses such
judicial review.I thus join in Part II of the opinion of the Court, and in

485OCTOBER TERM, 1993
Syllabus

CUSTIS v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 93-5209. Argued February 28, 1994--Decided May 23, 1994
After the jury convicted petitioner Custis of possession of a firearm by a

felon and another federal crime, the Government relied on his prior
state-court convictions for robbery in Pennsylvania and for burglary and
attempted burglary in Maryland to support a motion under the Armed
Career Criminal Act of 1984, 18 U. S. C. $ 924(e) (ACCA), which provides
for enhancement of the sentence of a convicted firearms possessor who
"has three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony or a serious
drug offense." Custis challenged the use for this purpose of the two
Maryland convictions on the ground, among others, of ineffective assistance of counsel during the state prosecutions, but the District Court
held that $ 924(e)(1) provides no statutory right to challenge such convictions and that the Constitution bars the use of a prior conviction for
enhancement only when there was a complete denial of counsel in the
prior proceeding. Custis was sentenced to an enhanced term of 235
months in prison, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held:

1. With the sole exception of convictions obtained in violation of the
right to counsel, a defendant in a federal sentencing proceeding has no
right to collaterally attack the validity of previous state convictions that
are used to enhance his sentence under the ACCA. Pp. 490-497.

(a) Congress did not intend to permit collateral attacks on prior
convictions under $ 924(e). The statute's language--which applies to a
defendant who has "three previous convictions" of the type specified--
focuses on the fact of the conviction, and nothing therein suggests that
the prior final conviction may be subject to attack for potential constitutional errors before it may be counted. That there is no implied right
of collateral attack under $ 924(e) is strongly supported by $ 921(a)(20),
which provides that a court may not count a conviction "which has been
. . . set aside" by the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held,
and thereby creates a clear negative implication that courts may count
a conviction that has not been so set aside; by the contrast between

$ 924(e) and other related statutes that expressly permit repeat offenders to challenge prior convictions that are used for enhancement purposes, see, e. g., 21 U. S. C. $ 851(c); and by Lewis v. United States, 445

current felon-in-possession-of-a-firearm statute did not allow collateral
attack on the predicate conviction. Pp. 490-493.

(b) The right, recognized in Burgett v. Texas, 389 U. S. 109, and
United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443, to collaterally attack prior convictions used for sentence enhancement purposes cannot be extended beyond the right, established in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, to
have appointed counsel. Since Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, and
running through Burgett and Tucker, there has been a theme that failure to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant was a unique constitutional defect. None of the constitutional violations alleged by Custis,
including the claimed denial of effective assistance of counsel, rises to
the level of a jurisdictional defect resulting from the failure to appoint
counsel at all. This conclusion is supported by the interest in promoting the finality of judgments and avoiding delay and protraction of the
federal sentencing process, and by the relative ease of administering a
claim of failure to appoint counsel, as opposed to other constitutional
challenges. Pp. 493-497.

2. However, Custis, who was still "in custody" for purposes of his
state convictions at the time of his federal sentencing under $ 924(e),
may attack his state sentences in Maryland or through federal habeas
corpus review. See Maleng v. Cook, 490 U. S. 488, 492. If he is successful in attacking these state sentences, he may then apply for reopening of any federal sentence enhanced by the state sentences. The
Court expresses no opinion on the appropriate disposition of such an
application. P. 497.

Opinion of the Court
Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

The Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984, 18 U. S. C.$ 924(e) (ACCA), raises the penalty for possession of a firearm by a felon from a maximum of 10 years in prison to amandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and a maximum of
life in prison without parole if the defendant "has three pre-vious convictions . . . for a violent felony or a serious drug
offense." We granted certiorari to determine whether a de-fendant in a federal sentencing proceeding may collaterally
attack the validity of previous state convictions that are usedto enhance his sentence under the ACCA. We hold that a
defendant has no such right (with the sole exception of con-victions obtained in violation of the right to counsel) to collaterally attack prior convictions.Baltimore City Police arrested petitioner Darren J. Custis
on July 1, 1991. A federal grand jury indicted him on threecounts: (1) possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in
violation of 21 U. S. C. $ 841(a)(1); (2) use of a firearm in con-nection with a drug trafficking offense in violation of 18
U. S. C. $ 924(c); and (3) possession of a firearm by a convictedfelon in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1). Before trial in
the United States District Court for the District of Mary-land, the Government notified Custis that it would seek an
enhanced penalty for the $ 922(g)(1) offense under $ 924(e)(1).The notice charged that he had three prior felony convicKeyser, Assistant Attorneys General, and by the Attorneys General for

Opinion of the Court
tions: (1) a 1985 Pennsylvania state-court conviction for rob-bery; (2) a 1985 Maryland state-court conviction for burglary;

and (3) a 1989 Maryland state-court conviction for at-tempted burglary.

The jury found Custis not guilty of possession with intent
to distribute and not guilty of use of a firearm during a drugoffense, but convicted him of possession of a firearm and simple cocaine possession, a lesser included offense in the chargeof possession with intent to distribute cocaine. At the sentencing hearing, the Government moved to have Custis' sen-tence enhanced under $ 924(e)(1), based on the prior convictions included in the notice of sentence enhancement.

Custis challenged the use of the two Maryland convictions
for sentence enhancement. He argued that his lawyer for
his 1985 burglary conviction rendered unconstitutionally ineffective assistance and that his guilty plea was not knowing
and intelligent as required by Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U. S.
238 (1969). He claimed that his attorney had failed to advise
him of the defense of voluntary intoxication, and that he
would have gone to trial, rather than pleaded guilty, had he
been aware of that defense. He challenged his 1989 conviction on the ground that it had been based upon a "stipulated
facts" trial. He claimed that such a "stipulated facts" trial
was tantamount to a guilty plea and that his conviction was
fundamentally unfair because he had not been adequately
advised of his rights. Custis further asserts that he had
been denied effective assistance of counsel in that case because the stipulated facts established only attempted breaking and entering rather than attempted burglary under
state law.

The District Court initially rejected Custis' collateral
attacks on his two Maryland state-court convictions. The
District Court's letter ruling determined that the performance of Custis' attorney in the 1985 case did not fall below
the standard of professional competence required under
Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Order in

No. S 91-0334 (D. Md., Feb. 27, 1992), p. 1. It found thatcounsel's recommendation of a guilty plea was not unreasonable under the circumstances. Id., at 2. The District Courtalso rejected Custis' claim that the 1989 "stipulated facts"
trial was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea. Id., at
2-3.The District Court later reversed field and determined

that it could not entertain Custis' challenges to his prior con-victions at all. It noted that "[u]nlike the statutory scheme
for enhancement of sentences in drug cases, [$ 924(e)(1)] pro-vides no statutory right to challenge prior convictions relied
upon by the Government for enhancement." 786 F. Supp.
533, 535-536 (Md. 1992). The District Court went on to
state that the Constitution bars the use of a prior conviction
for sentence enhancement only when there was a complete
denial of counsel in the prior proceeding. Id., at 536, citing
Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963); United States v.
Tucker, 404 U. S. 443 (1972); and Burgett v. Texas, 389 U. S.
109 (1967). Based on Custis' offense level of 33 and his criminal history category of VI, the District Court imposed a
sentence of 235 months in prison.

The Court of Appeals affirmed. 988 F. 2d 1355 (CA4
1993). It recognized the right of a defendant who had been
completely deprived of counsel to assert a collateral attack
on his prior convictions since such a defendant "has lost his
ability to assert all his other constitutional rights." Id., at
1360, citing Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 465 (1938). Citing the "substantial burden" on prosecutors and the district
courts, the Court of Appeals dismissed all of Custis' challenges to his prior convictions as the "fact-intensive" type
that pose a risk of unduly delaying and protracting the entire
sentencing process. 988 F. 2d, at 1361. The prospect of
such fact-intensive inquiries led it to express great reluctance at forcing district courts to overcome the " `inadequacy
or unavailability of state court records and witnesses' " in
trying to determine the validity of prior sentences. Ibid.,

Opinion of the Court
quoting United States v. Jones, 977 F. 2d 105, 109 (CA4 1992).
In addition to the practical hurdles, the Court of Appeals
specified concerns over comity and federalism as other factors weighing against permitting collateral attacks. " `Federal courts are not forums in which to relitigate state
trials.' " 988 F. 2d, at 1361, quoting Barefoot v. Estelle, 463
U. S. 880, 887 (1983). We granted certiorari, 510 U. S. 913
(1993), because the Court of Appeals' decision conflicted with
recent decisions from other Courts of Appeals that permitted
defendants to challenge prior convictions that are used in
sentencing under $ 924(e)(1).1

Custis argues that the ACCA should be read to permit
defendants to challenge the constitutionality of convictions
used for sentencing purposes. Looking to the language of
the statute, we do not believe $ 924(e) authorizes such collateral attacks. The ACCA provides an enhanced sentence for
any person who unlawfully possesses a firearm in violation
of 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g) 2 and "has three previous convictions
by any court referred to in section 922(g)(1) of this title for
a violent felony or a serious drug offense . . . ." Section
924(e) applies whenever a defendant is found to have suffered
"three previous convictions" of the type specified. The stat1 See, e. g., United States v. Paleo, 967 F. 2d 7, 11 (CA1 1992); United
States v. Merritt, 882 F. 2d 916, 918 (CA5 1989); United States v. McGlocklin, 8 F. 3d 1037 (CA6 1993) (en banc); United States v. Gallman, 907
F. 2d 639, 642-645 (CA7 1990); United States v. Day, 949 F. 2d 973, 981-983

and United States v. Franklin, 972 F. 2d 1253, 1257-1258 (CA11 1992).

"(g) It shall be unlawful for any person--
"(1) who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;. . . . .

"to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or
affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm
or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or
foreign commerce."

Opinion of the Court
ute focuses on the fact of the conviction and nothing suggeststhat the prior final conviction may be subject to collateral

attack for potential constitutional errors before it may becounted.

Absent specific statutory authorization, Custis contends
that an implied right to challenge the constitutionality ofprior convictions exists under $ 924(e). Again we disagree.

The Gun Control Act of 1968, of which $ 924(e) is a part,strongly indicates that unchallenged prior convictions may
be used for purposes of $ 924(e). At least for prior violentfelonies, $ 921(a)(20) describes the circumstances in which a
prior conviction may be counted for sentencing purposesunder $ 924(e):

"What constitutes a conviction of . . . a crime shall bedetermined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held. Any convic-tion which has been expunged, or set aside or for which
a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored shall not be considered a conviction for purposesof this chapter [18 U. S. C. $$ 921-930]."

The provision that a court may not count a conviction "which
has been . . . set aside" creates a clear negative implicationthat courts

may count a conviction that has not been set
aside.

Congress' passage of other related statutes that expresslypermit repeat offenders to challenge prior convictions that

are used for enhancement purposes supports this negativeimplication. For example, 21 U. S. C. $ 851(c), which Congress enacted as part of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse
Prevention and Control Act of 1970, sets forth specific procedures allowing a defendant to challenge the validity of a
prior conviction used to enhance the sentence for a federal
drug offense. Section 851(c)(1) states that "[i]f the person
denies any allegation of the information of prior conviction,
or claims that any conviction alleged is invalid, he shall file

511us2$51H 11-05-97 14:06:49 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
a written response to the information." Section 851(c)(2)goes on to provide:

"A person claiming that a conviction alleged in theinformation was obtained in violation of the Constitution
of the United States shall set forth his claim, and thefactual basis therefor, with particularity in his response
to the information. The person shall have the burdenof proof by a preponderance of the evidence on any issue
of fact raised by the response. Any challenge to a priorconviction, not raised by response to the information
before an increased sentence is imposed in reliance
thereon, shall be waived unless good cause be shown forfailure to make a timely challenge."

The language of $ 851(c) shows that when Congress intended
to authorize collateral attacks on prior convictions at the
time of sentencing, it knew how to do so. Congress' omis-sion of similar language in $ 924(e) indicates that it did not

intend to give defendants the right to challenge the validityof prior convictions under this statute. Cf.

Gozlon-Peretz v.
United States, 498 U. S. 395, 404 (1991) (" `[W]here Congressincludes particular language in one section of a statute but

omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generallypresumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in
the disparate inclusion or exclusion' "), quoting Russello v.
United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotationmarks omitted).

Our decision in Lewis v. United States, 445 U. S. 55 (1980),also supports the conclusion that prior convictions used for
sentence enhancement purposes under $ 924(e) are not subject to collateral attack in the sentence proceeding. Lewis
interpreted 18 U. S. C. App. $ 1202(a)(1) (1982 ed.), one of the
predecessors to the current felon-in-possession-of-a-firearm
statute. Section 1202(a)(1) was aimed at any person who
"has been convicted by a court of the United States or of a
State . . . of a felony." We concluded that " `[n]othing on the

Opinion of the Court
face of the statute suggests a congressional intent to limitits coverage to persons [whose convictions are not subject to

collateral attack].' " 445 U. S., at 60, quoting United Statesv.

Culbert, 435 U. S. 371, 373 (1978). This lack of such intent
in $ 1202(a)(1) also contrasted with other federal statutes
that explicitly permitted a defendant to challenge the valid-ity or constitutionality of the predicate felony. See,

e. g., 18
U. S. C. $ 3575(e) (note following ch. 227) (dangerous specialoffender) and 21 U. S. C. $ 851(c)(2) (recidivism under the

Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of1970). The absence of expressed intent, and the contrast
with other federal statutes, led us to determine that "the
firearms prosecution [under $ 1202(a)(1)] does not open the
predicate conviction to a new form of collateral attack." 445
U. S., at 67.

Similarly, $ 924(e) lacks any indication that Congress intended to permit collateral attacks on prior convictions used
for sentence enhancement purposes. The contrast between

$ 924(e) and statutes that expressly provide avenues for collateral attacks, as well as our decision in Lewis, supra, point
strongly to the conclusion that Congress did not intend to
permit collateral attacks on prior convictions under $ 924(e).

Custis argues that regardless of whether $ 924(e) permits
collateral challenges to prior convictions, the Constitution
requires that they be allowed. He relies upon our decisions
in Burgett v. Texas, 389 U. S. 109 (1967), and United States
v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443 (1972), in support of this argument.
Both of these decisions relied upon our earlier decision in
Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963), holding that the
Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution required that an indigent defendant in state-court proceedings
have counsel appointed for him. Gideon, in turn, overruled
our earlier decision in Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455 (1942),
which had held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel,
long applied in federal-court proceedings, was not itself made
applicable to the States by the Due Process Clause. The

511us2$51H 11-05-97 14:06:49 PAGES OPINPGT
494 CUSTIS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Due Process Clause, Betts had held, required the appoint-ment of counsel for an indigent defendant in state courts only

upon a showing of special circumstances. Id., at 473.But even before

Betts v. Brady was decided, this Court
had held that the failure to appoint counsel for an indigent
defendant in a federal proceeding not only violated the SixthAmendment, but was subject to collateral attack in federal

habeas corpus. Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 (1938). Ata time when the underlying habeas statute was construed to
allow collateral attacks on final judgments of conviction onlywhere the rendering court lacked "jurisdiction"--albeit a
somewhat expansive notion of "jurisdiction," see Moore v.
Dempsey, 261 U. S. 86 (1923)--this Court attributed a jurisdictional significance to the failure to appoint counsel. The
Court said:

"If the accused, however, is not represented by counseland has not competently and intelligently waived his

constitutional right, the Sixth Amendment stands as a
jurisdictional bar to a valid conviction and sentence depriving him of his life or his liberty. . . . The judgment
of conviction pronounced by a court without jurisdiction
is void, and one imprisoned thereunder may obtain release by habeas corpus." 304 U. S., at 468.

When the Court later expanded the availability of federal
habeas to other constitutional violations, it did so by frankly
stating that the federal habeas statute made such relief
available for them, without claiming that the denial of these
constitutional rights by the trial court would have denied
it jurisdiction. See, e. g., Waley v. Johnston, 316 U. S. 101,
104-105 (1942) (coerced confession); Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S.
443 (1953). There is thus a historical basis in our jurisprudence of collateral attacks for treating the right to have
counsel appointed as unique, perhaps because of our oftstated view that "[t]he right to be heard would be, in many

Opinion of the Court
cases, of little avail if it did not comprehend the right to be
heard by counsel." Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 68-69
(1932).

Following our decision in Gideon, the Court decided Burgett v. Texas, supra. There the defendant was charged
under a Texas recidivist statute with having been the subject
of four previous felony convictions. 389 U. S., at 111. The
prosecutor introduced certified records of one of the defendant's earlier convictions in Tennessee. Id., at 112. The defendant objected to the admission of this conviction on the
ground that he had not been represented by counsel and had
not waived his right to counsel, but his objection was overruled by the trial court. Id., at 113. This Court reversed,
finding that the certified records of the Tennessee conviction
on their face raised a "presumption that petitioner was denied his right to counsel . . . , and therefore that his conviction was void." Id., at 114. The Court held that the admission of a prior criminal conviction that is constitutionally
infirm under the standards of Gideon is inherently prejudicial and to permit use of such a tainted prior conviction
for sentence enhancement would undermine the principle of
Gideon. 389 U. S., at 115.

A similar situation arose in Tucker, supra. The defendant
had been convicted of bank robbery in California in 1953.
At sentencing, the District Court conducted an inquiry into
the defendant's background, and, the record shows, gave explicit attention to the three previous felony convictions that
the defendant had acknowledged at trial. The District
Court sentenced him to 25 years in prison--the stiffest term
authorized by the applicable federal statute, 18 U. S. C.

$ 2113(d). 404 U. S., at 444. Several years later, after having obtained a judicial determination that two of his prior
convictions were constitutionally invalid, the defendant filed
a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court in which he had
been convicted of bank robbery. He challenged the use at

496 CUSTIS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
his 1953 bank robbery trial of his three previous felony con-victions. This Court sustained his challenge insofar as his

sentence was concerned, saying "Gideon . . . established anunequivocal rule `making it unconstitutional to try a person
for a felony in a state court unless he had a lawyer or had
validly waived one.' " Id., at 449, quoting Burgett v. Texas,
supra, at 114. The Court held that "[e]rosion of the Gideon
principle can be prevented here only by affirming the judg-ment of the Court of Appeals remanding this case to the trial

court for reconsideration of the [defendant's] sentence." 404U. S., at 449.

Custis invites us to extend the right to attack collaterally
prior convictions used for sentence enhancement beyond the
right to have appointed counsel established in Gideon. We
decline to do so. We think that since the decision in Johnson v. Zerbst more than half a century ago, and running
through our decisions in Burgett and Tucker, there has been
a theme that failure to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant was a unique constitutional defect. Custis attacks
his previous convictions claiming the denial of the effective
assistance of counsel, that his guilty plea was not knowing
and intelligent, and that he had not been adequately advised
of his rights in opting for a "stipulated facts" trial. None of
these alleged constitutional violations rises to the level of
a jurisdictional defect resulting from the failure to appoint
counsel at all. Johnson v. Zerbst, supra.

Ease of administration also supports the distinction. As
revealed in a number of the cases cited in this opinion, failure
to appoint counsel at all will generally appear from the judgment roll itself, or from an accompanying minute order. But
determination of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel,
and failure to assure that a guilty plea was voluntary, would
require sentencing courts to rummage through frequently
nonexistent or difficult to obtain state-court transcripts or
records that may date from another era, and may come from
any one of the 50 States.

Opinion of the Court
The interest in promoting the finality of judgments pro-vides additional support for our constitutional conclusion.

As we have explained, "[i]nroads on the concept of finalitytend to undermine confidence in the integrity of our procedures" and inevitably delay and impair the orderly adminis-tration of justice.

United States v. Addonizio, 442 U. S. 178,184, n. 11 (1979). We later noted in Parke v. Raley, 506 U. S.

20 (1992), that principles of finality associated with habeascorpus actions apply with at least equal force when a defendant seeks to attack a previous conviction used for sentencing.By challenging the previous conviction, the defendant is asking a district court "to deprive [the] [state-court judgment]of [its] normal force and effect in a proceeding that ha[s] an
independent purpose other than to overturn the prior judg-men[t]."

Id., at 30. These principles bear extra weight incases in which the prior convictions, such as one challenged

by Custis, are based on guilty pleas, because when a guiltyplea is at issue, "the concern with finality served by the limitation on collateral attack has special force." United Statesv.

Timmreck, 441 U. S. 780, 784 (1979) (footnote omitted).We therefore hold that $ 924(e) does not permit Custis to

use the federal sentencing forum to gain review of his stateconvictions. Congress did not prescribe and the Constitution does not require such delay and protraction of the fed-eral sentencing process. We recognize, however, as did the
Court of Appeals, see 988 F. 2d, at 1363, that Custis, whowas still "in custody" for purposes of his state convictions at
the time of his federal sentencing under $ 924(e), may attackhis state sentences in Maryland or through federal habeas
review. See Maleng v. Cook, 490 U. S. 488, 492 (1989). IfCustis is successful in attacking these state sentences, he
may then apply for reopening of any federal sentence en-hanced by the state sentences. We express no opinion on
the appropriate disposition of such an application.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly

Affirmed.

Souter, J., dissenting
Justice Souter, with whom Justice Blackmun and
Justice Stevens join, dissenting.

The Court answers a difficult constitutional question that
I believe the underlying statute does not pose. Because in
my judgment the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984, 18
U. S. C. $ 924(e) (ACCA), does not authorize sentence enhancement based on prior convictions that a defendant can
show at sentencing to have been unlawfully obtained, I
respectfully dissent.

I

A

The ACCA mandatory minimum sentence applies to defendants with "three previous convictions . . . for a violent
felony or a serious drug offense." 18 U. S. C. $ 924(e). The
Court construes "convictio[n]" to refer to the "fact of the
conviction," ante, at 491 (emphasis in original), and concludes
that "Congress did not intend to permit collateral attacks
[during sentencing] on prior convictions under $ 924(e),"
ante, at 493.1 This interpretation of the ACCA will come as
a surprise to the Courts of Appeals, which (with the one
exception of the court below) have understood "convictio[n]"
in the ACCA to mean "lawful conviction," and have permitted defendants to show at sentencing that a prior conviction
offered for enhancement was unconstitutionally obtained,
whether as violative of the right to have appointed counsel,
see Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963), the right to

1 The Court's opinion makes clear that it uses the phrase "collateral attack" to refer to an attack during sentencing. See, e. g., ante, at 487 ("We
granted certiorari to determine whether a defendant in a federal sentencing proceeding may collaterally attack the validity of previous state convictions that are used to enhance his sentence under the ACCA").

Alabama, 395 U. S. 238 (1969), or other constitutional rights.2The weight of appellate authority, in my opinion, reflects the

proper construction of the ACCA.The Court's contrary reading ignores the legal framework
within which Congress drafted the ACCA, a framework withwhich we presume Congress was familiar. See,

e. g., Can-non v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 696-698 (1979).

When the language that became the ACCA was first pro-posed in 1982, when it was enacted in 1984 (codified at

$ 1202(a)(1)) and when it was reenacted in 1986 (codified at$ 924(e)), this Court's decisions in Burgett v. Texas, 389 U. S.
109 (1967), and United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443 (1972),were on the books. Even under the narrow reading the
Court accords those decisions today, they recognize at leasta right to raise during sentencing

Gideon challenges to priorconvictions used for enhancement. See ante, at 495-496.

Unless Congress intended to snub that constitutional right(and we ordinarily indulge a "strong presumption . . . that
Congress legislated in accordance with the Constitution,"
Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U. S. 448, 477(1957) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting)), "convictio[n]" in $ 924(e)

simply cannot refer to the mere fact of conviction, and theprovision must have been meant to allow during sentencing
at least some challenges to prior convictions offered forenhancement.

Nor is it likely that Congress's intent was informed by asnarrow a reading of

Burgett and Tucker as the Court adopts

today. In the legal environment of the ACCA's enactment,
Burgett and Tucker were thought to stand for the broader
proposition that "[n]o consideration can be given [at sentenc-ing] to a conviction that was unconstitutionally obtained," 3

C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 526, p. 102
(1982), and Courts of Appeals consistently read the decisionsas requiring courts to entertain claims that prior convictions

relied upon for enhancement were unconstitutional for rea-sons other than

Gideon violations.3 The Congress that
enacted the ACCA against this backdrop must be presumedto have intended to permit defendants to attempt to show at

sentencing that prior convictions were "unconstitutionallyobtained."

That presumption is strongly bolstered by the fact thatCongress, despite the consistent interpretation of the ACCA
as permitting attacks on prior convictions during sentencing,
and despite amending the law several times since its enactment (see note following 18 U. S. C. $ 924 (1988 ed. and Supp.
V) (listing amendments)), left the language relevant here untouched. Congress's failure to express legislative disagreement with the appellate courts' reading of the ACCA cannot be
disregarded, especially since Congress has acted in this area in
response to other Courts of Appeals decisions that it thought
revealed statutory flaws requiring "correct[ion]." S. Rep.

ratified" the interpretation). Accordingly, absent clear indi-cation that Congress intended to preclude all challenges during sentencing to prior convictions relied upon for enhance-ment, the ACCA must be read as permitting such challenges.

B
The Court fails to identify any language in the ACCA af-firmatively precluding collateral attacks on prior convictions

during sentencing, as there is none. Instead, the Courthears a clear message in the statutory silence, but I find none
of its arguments persuasive. The Court first invokes 18U. S. C. $ 921(a)(20), under which a conviction "which has
been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has beenpardoned or has had civil rights restored shall not be considered a conviction for purposes of this chapter." Accordingto the Court, this "exemption clause" (as we have elsewhere
called it, see Beecham v. United States, ante, at 369, "createsa clear negative implication that courts may count a conviction that has not been set aside," ante, at 491. Expressiounius, in other words, est exclusio alterius.

Even if the premise of the Court's argument is correct,4the bridge the Court crosses to reach its conclusion is notoriously unreliable and does not bear the weight here. While"often a valuable servant," the maxim that the inclusion of
something negatively implies the exclusion of everythingelse (expressio unius, etc.) is "a dangerous master to follow
in the construction of statutes." Ford v. United States, 273U. S. 593, 612 (1927) (internal quotation marks and citation
omitted). It rests on the assumption that all omissions in

4 Despite the Court's unstated assumption to the contrary, a sentencing
court that finds a prior conviction to have been unconstitutionally obtained
can be said to have "set aside" the conviction for purposes of the sentencing, a reading that squares better than the Court's with the evident purpose of the exemption clause (as well as the statute that added it to

$ 921(a)(20), the "Firearm Owner's Protection Act") of disregarding convictions that do not fairly and reliably demonstrate a person's bad character.

legislative drafting are deliberate, an assumption we know
to be false. See Posner, Statutory Interpretation--in the
Classroom and in the Courtroom, 50 U. Chi. L. Rev. 800, 813
(1983); Radin, Statutory Interpretation, 43 Harv. L. Rev. 863,
873-874 (1930). As a result, "[s]cholars have long savaged
the expressio canon," Cheney R. Co. v. ICC, 902 F. 2d 66, 68
(CADC 1990) (Williams, J.), at least when it is made to do
the work of a conclusive presumption, and our decisions support the proposition that "[s]ometimes [the canon] applies and
sometimes it does not, and whether it does or does not
depends largely on context." R. Dickerson, Interpretation
and Application of Statutes 47 (1975); see also id., at 234-235.

In this case, the "contemporary legal context," Cannon v.
University of Chicago, 441 U. S., at 699, in which Congress
drafted the ACCA requires rejecting the negative implication on which the Court relies. That context, as I have described, understood defendants to have a constitutional right
to attack at sentencing prior convictions that had not previously been invalidated, and in that legal setting it would
have been very odd for Congress to have intended to establish a constitutionally controversial rule by mere implication.
See Lowe v. SEC, 472 U. S. 181, 206, n. 50 (1985) ("In areas
where legislation might intrude on constitutional guarantees,
we believe that Congress, which has always sworn to protect
the Constitution, would err on the side of fundamental constitutional liberties when its legislation implicates those liberties") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
And in fact the legislative history indicates that quite a different intention informed the addition to $ 921(a)(20) in 1986,
two years after the ACCA's enactment, of the exemption
clause (and the related "choice-of-law clause," Beecham v.
United States, ante, at 369. Congress simply intended to
clarify that the law of the convicting jurisdiction should be
the principal reference point in determining what counts as
a "conviction" for purposes of the federal "felon in posses511us2$51M 11-05-97 14:06:50 PAGES OPINPGT

sion" law, and to correct an oversight that had resulted in
the omission of exemption language from one of two parallel
provisions. See S. Rep. No. 98-583, supra, at 7; H. R. Rep.
No. 99-495, p. 20 (1986). In amending $ 921(a)(20), Congress
was not addressing the question of where, in the course of
federal litigation, a conviction could be challenged. Indeed,
the legislative history of the amendment reveals no hint of
any intention at all with respect to $ 924(e)'s sentenceenhancement provision, but rather an exclusive focus on the
federal firearms disability in $ 922. Cf. Miles v. Illinois
Central R. Co., 315 U. S. 698, 714-715 (1942) (Frankfurter, J.,
dissenting) (relying on legislative history to counter a negative implication from a statute's text). As a result, the
Court's argument by negative implication from $ 921(a)(20)'s
exemption clause must fail. The fact that Congress in the
exemption clause expressly precluded reliance upon unconstitutional convictions that have been set aside simply does
not reveal an intent with respect to $ 924(e) to require reliance at sentencing on unconstitutional convictions that have
not yet been set aside.

The Court's second statutory argument also seeks to establish congressional intent through negative implication,
but is no more successful. The Court observes that Congress in other statutes expressly permitted challenges to
prior convictions during sentencing, see ante, at 491-493 (citing 21 U. S. C. $ 851(c)(2) and 18 U. S. C. $ 3575(e)), which is
said to show that "when Congress intended to authorize collateral attacks on prior convictions at the time of sentencing,
it knew how to do so," ante, at 492. But surely the Court
does not believe that, if Congress intended to preclude collateral attacks on prior convictions at the time of sentencing, it
did not know how to do that. And again, the Court's effort
to infer intent from the statutory silence runs afoul of the
context of the statute's enactment; within a legal framework

fendant can show to be invalid, a Congress that intended torequire sentencing on the basis of such convictions can be

expected to have made its intention explicit.Finally, the Court turns for support to

Lewis v. United
States, 445 U. S. 55 (1980), which held that the federal "felon
in possession" law does not permit a defendant, during hisprosecution, to challenge the constitutional validity of the

predicate felony conviction. The Court's reliance on Lewis,however, assumes an equivalence between two different
types of laws that Lewis itself disclaimed: between a lawdisabling convicted felons from possessing firearms (at issue
in Lewis), and a law requiring sentence enhancement based
on prior convictions (at issue here, as well as in Burgett and
Tucker). Lewis explained that the "felon in possession" law
is "a sweeping prophylaxis" designed "to keep firearms away
from potentially dangerous persons," 445 U. S., at 63, 67,
whereas a sentence-enhancement law "depend[s] upon the
reliability of a past . . . conviction," id., at 67. While the
unlawfulness of a past conviction is irrelevant to the former,
it is not to the latter, or so the Lewis Court thought in expressly distinguishing Burgett and Tucker: "[e]nforcement of
[the federal gun disability] does not `support guilt or enhance
punishment' . . . on the basis of a conviction that is unreliable." 445 U. S., at 67 (quoting Burgett, 389 U. S., at 115).

Because of the material way in which a "felon in possession" law differs from a sentence-enhancement law, Burgett
and Tucker were not part of the relevant legal backdrop
against which Congress enacted the law interpreted in
Lewis, and the Lewis Court could thus fairly presume that
"conviction" in the statute before it was used as shorthand
for "the fact of a felony conviction." 445 U. S., at 60, 67.
As Lewis itself recognized, however, Burgett and Tucker are
part of the backdrop against which sentence-enhancement
laws are enacted, and against that backdrop Congress must
be presumed to have used "conviction" in $ 924(e) to mean
"lawful conviction," and to have permitted defendants to

show at sentencing that prior convictions offered for en-hancement were unconstitutionally obtained.

Even if I thought the ACCA was ambiguous (the most theCourt's statutory arguments could establish), I would resolve the ambiguity in petitioner's favor in accordance withthe " `cardinal principle' " of statutory construction that
" `this Court will first ascertain whether a construction ofthe statute is fairly possible by which [a constitutional] question may be avoided.' " Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288,348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (quoting Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 62 (1932)); see also Edward J. DeBartoloCorp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades
Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988); NLRB v. Catholic Bishop
of Chicago, 440 U. S. 490, 499-501, 504 (1979); Blodgett v.Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 148 (1927) (Holmes, J., concurring in

result). The Ashwander principle, to be sure, comes intoplay only when the constitutional question to be avoided is a
difficult one, but that designation easily fits the question thatthe Court's reading of the ACCA requires it to decide, the
question whether the Constitution permits courts to enhancea defendant's sentence on the basis of a prior conviction the
defendant can show was obtained in violation of his right toeffective assistance of counsel, see

Strickland v. Washing-ton, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), or that the defendant can show was

based on an unknowing or involuntary guilty plea, see Boy-kin v. Alabama, 395 U. S. 238 (1969).

This is a difficult question, for one thing, because the lan-guage and logic of

Burgett and Tucker are hard to limit toclaimed violations of the right, recognized in Gideon v. Wainwright, to have a lawyer appointed if necessary. As indi-cated by the uniformity of lower court decisions interpreting
them, see supra, at 500, and n. 3, Burgett and Tucker areeasily (if not best) read as announcing the broader principle

511us2$51M 11-05-97 14:06:50 PAGES OPINPGT
506 CUSTIS v. UNITED STATES

Souter, J., dissenting
that a sentence may not be enhanced by a conviction thedefendant can show was obtained in violation of any " `specific federal right' " (or, as Tucker put it, that a sentence maynot be "founded [even] in part upon misinformation of constitutional magnitude," 404 U. S., at 447) because to do so wouldbe to allow the underlying right to be "denied anew" and
to "suffer serious erosion," Burgett, supra, at 116 (citationomitted); see also

Tucker, supra, at 449. The Court's refer-ences in both Burgett and Tucker to the right discussed in

Gideon is hardly surprising; that was the "specific federalright" (and the record of the conviction obtained in violation of it the "misinformation of constitutional magnitude")that the defendants before it invoked. The opinions in both
cases, moreover, made it quite clear that the discussion of
Gideon was not meant to supply a limitation. Burgett de-scribed

Gideon not as unique but as "illustrative of the limitations which the Constitution places on state criminal pro-cedures," and it recounted as supportive of its holding cases

involving coerced confessions, denials of the confrontation
right, and illegal searches and seizures, 389 U. S., at 114; and
Tucker made it clear that "the real question" before the
Court was whether the defendant's sentence might havebeen different if the sentencing judge had known that the

defendant's "previous convictions had been unconstitution-ally obtained," 404 U. S., at 448.

5 The notion that Burgett and Tucker stand for the narrow principle
today's majority describes has escaped the Court twice before. In Parke
v. Raley, 506 U. S. 20, 31 (1992), the Court rejected the argument that
Burgett requires States to place the burden on the government during
sentencing to prove the validity of prior convictions offered for enhancement. Though the underlying claim in Raley was the same as one of the
claims here (that a prior conviction resulted from an invalid guilty plea),
the Court did not hold Burgett inapposite as involving a violation of Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 355 (1963), but rather accepted Burgett's applicability and distinguished the case on different grounds. See 506 U. S.,
at 31. And in Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862 (1983), the Court described
Tucker as holding that a "sentence must be set aside if the trial court

507Cite as: 511 U. S. 485 (1994)
Souter, J., dissenting
Even if, consistently with principles of stare decisis, Bur-gett and Tucker could be read as applying only to some class

of cases defined to exclude claimed violations of Stricklandor Boykin, the question whether to confine them so is not
easily answered for purposes of the Ashwander rule. Burgett and Tucker deal directly with claimed violations of Gid-eon, and distinguishing for these purposes between violations of Gideon and Strickland would describe a very fineline. To establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment under
Strickland, a defendant must show that "counsel's perform-ance was deficient," and that "the deficient performance
prejudiced the defense" in that "counsel's errors were so se-rious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose
result is reliable." 466 U. S., at 687. It is hard to see howsuch a defendant is any better off than one who has been
denied counsel altogether, and why the conviction of sucha defendant may be used for sentence enhancement if the
conviction of one who has been denied counsel altogethermay not. The Sixth Amendment guarantees no mere formality of appointment, but the "assistance" of counsel, cf.Strickland, supra, at 685, 686 ("That a person who happens
to be a lawyer is present at trial alongside the accused . . .is not enough to satisfy the [Sixth Amendment]" because
" `the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistanceof counsel' "), and whether the violation is of Gideon or
Strickland, the defendant has been denied that constitu-tional right.

It is also difficult to see why a sentencing court that mustentertain a defendant's claim that a prior conviction was obtained in violation of the Sixth Amendment's right to counselneed not entertain a defendant's claim that a prior conviction
was based on an unknowing or involuntary guilty plea.
relied at least in part on `misinformation of constitutional magnitude' such
as prior uncounseled convictions that were unconstitutionally imposed,"
462 U. S., at 887, n. 23 (quoting Tucker, 404 U. S., at 447), clearly indicating
an understanding that Tucker was not limited to Gideon violations.

511us2$51M 11-05-97 14:06:50 PAGES OPINPGT
508 CUSTIS v. UNITED STATES

Souter, J., dissenting
That claim, if meritorious, would mean that the defendantwas convicted despite invalid waivers of at least one of two

Sixth Amendment rights (to trial by jury and to confrontadverse witnesses) or of a Fifth Amendment right (against
compulsory self-incrimination). See Boykin, 395 U. S., at
243. It is, to be sure, no simple task to prove that a guiltyplea was the result of "[i]gnorance, incomprehension, coercion, terror, inducements, [or] subtle or blatant threats," id.,at 242-243, but it is certainly at least a difficult question
whether a defendant who can make such a showing oughtto receive less favorable treatment than the defendants in
Burgett and Tucker.

Though the Court offers a theory for drawing a line between the right claimed to have been violated in Burgett and
Tucker and the rights claimed to have been violated here,
the Court's theory is itself fraught with difficulty. In the
Court's view, the principle of Burgett and Tucker reaches
only "constitutional violations ris[ing] to the level of a jurisdictional defect resulting from the failure to appoint counsel
at all." Ante, at 496 (citing Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458
(1938)). But nowhere in Burgett or Tucker is a distinction drawn between "jurisdictional" and "nonjurisdictional"
rights, a fact giving no cause for surprise since long before
(in Waley v. Johnston, 316 U. S. 101 (1942)) "the Court
openly discarded the concept of jurisdiction--by then more
a fiction than anything else--as a touchstone of the availability of federal habeas review." Wainwright v. Sykes, 433
U. S. 72, 79 (1977). Nor was Johnson v. Zerbst, on which the
Court today places much reliance, a ringing endorsement of
a jurisdiction theory. For many years prior to that case,
"the concept of jurisdiction . . . was subjected to considerable
strain," Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 450 (1963) (Harlan, J.,
dissenting), and Johnson v. Zerbst was actually the very last
case to mention the idea, offering just "token deference
to the old concept that the [habeas] writ could only reach
jurisdictional defects," Wechsler, Habeas Corpus and the

Souter, J., dissenting
Supreme Court: Reconsidering the Reach of the Great Writ,59 U. Colo. L. Rev. 167, 174 (1988).

In reviving the "jurisdiction" theory, the Court skips overthe very difficulty that led to its abandonment, of devising a
standard to tell whether or not a flaw in the proceedingsleading to a conviction counts as a "jurisdictional defect."
"Once the concept of `jurisdiction' is taken beyond the ques-tion of the court's competence to deal with the class of offenses charged and the person of the prisoner" (as it mustbe if the concept is to reach

Gideon violations) "it becomesa less than luminous beacon." Bator, Finality in Criminal

Law and Federal Habeas Corpus for State Prisoners, 76
Harv. L. Rev. 441, 470 (1963). Thus, if being denied ap-pointed counsel is a "jurisdictional defect," why not being

denied effective counsel (treated as an equivalent in Strickland)? If a conviction obtained in violation of the right to
have appointed counsel suffers from a "jurisdictional defect"because the right's "purpose . . . is to protect an accused from

conviction resulting from his own ignorance of his legal andconstitutional rights,"

Johnson v. Zerbst, supra, at 465, how
distinguish a conviction based on a guilty plea resulting from
a defendant's own ignorance of his legal and constitutionalrights?

6 It was precisely due to the futility of providing

principled answers to these questions that more than 50
years ago, and a quarter of a century before Burgett and
Tucker, "[t]he Court finally abandoned the kissing of the

jurisdictional book." P. Bator, D. Meltzer, P. Mishkin, & D.Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the

Federal System 1502 (3d ed. 1988). The Court nevertheless
finds itself compelled to reembrace the concept of "jurisdic6 Judge Friendly suggested that a convicting court lacks jurisdiction if

tional defect," fraught as it is with difficulties, in order to
answer the constitutional question raised by its reading of
the ACCA. Because it is "fairly possible," Ashwander, 297
U. S., at 348, to construe the ACCA to avoid these difficulties
and those associated with the other constitutional questions
I have discussed, the Ashwander rule of restraint provides
sufficient reason to reject the Court's construction of the
ACCA.

B

The rule of lenity, "which applies not only to interpretations of the substantive ambit of criminal prohibitions,
but also to the penalties they impose," Albernaz v. United
States, 450 U. S. 333, 342 (1981), drives me to the same conclusion. Though lenity is usually invoked when there is
doubt about whether a legislature has criminalized particular
conduct, "[the] policy of lenity [also] means that the Court
will not interpret a federal criminal statute so as to increase
the penalty that it places on an individual when such an interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what
Congress intended." Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); cf. Bell v. United States, 349 U. S. 81, 83
(1955) ("It may fairly be said to be a presupposition of our
law to resolve doubts in the enforcement of a penal code
against the imposition of a harsher punishment"). Because
I "cannot say with assurance," United States v. Granderson,
ante, at 53, that Congress intended to require courts to enhance sentences on the basis of prior convictions a defendant
can show to be invalid, the rule of lenity independently requires interpreting the ACCA to permit defendants to present such challenges to the sentencing judge before sentence
is imposed.

C

The Court invokes "[e]ase of administration" to support
its constitutional holding. Ante, at 496. While I doubt that
even a powerful argument of administrative convenience

would suffice to displace the Ashwander rule, cf. Stanley v.
Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, 656 (1972), the burden argument here
is not a strong one. The burdens of allowing defendants tochallenge prior convictions at sentencing are not so severe,

and are likely less severe than those associated with the alternative avenues for raising the very same claims.For more than 20 years, as required by 21 U. S. C.

offered for enhancement are "invalid" or were "obtained inviolation of the Constitution," the unamended statute reflecting a continuing congressional judgment that any associated administrative burdens are justified and tolerable. For
almost a decade, federal courts have done the same under the
ACCA, see n. 2, supra, again without congressional notice of
any judicial burden thought to require relief. See also
Parke v. Raley, 506 U. S., at 32 ("In recent years state courts
have permitted various challenges to prior convictions" during sentencing). As against this, the Court sees administrative burdens arising because "sentencing courts [would be
required] to rummage through frequently nonexistent or difficult to obtain state-court transcripts or records that may
date from another era, and may come from any of the 50
States." Ante, at 496. It would not be sentencing courts
that would have to do this rummaging, however, but defendants seeking to avoid enhancement, for no one disagrees that
the burden of showing the invalidity of prior convictions
would rest on the defendants.

Whatever administrative benefits may flow from insulating
sentencing courts from challenges to prior convictions will
likely be offset by the administrative costs of the alternative
means of raising the same claims. The Court acknowledges
that an individual still in custody for a state conviction relied
upon for enhancement may attack that conviction through
state or federal habeas review and, if successful, "may . . .
apply for reopening any federal sentence enhanced by the

state sentences." Ante, at 497. And the Court does notdisturb uniform appellate case law holding that an individual

serving an enhanced sentence may invoke federal habeasto reduce the sentence to the extent it was lengthened by
a prior unconstitutional conviction. See J. Liebman & R.Hertz, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure $ 8.2,
pp. 62-64, and n. 13.2, and $ 8.4, p. 89, n. 27 (1993 Supp.)(collecting cases).

7 From the perspective of administrability, it strikes me as entirely sensible to resolve any chal-lenges to the lawfulness of a predicate conviction in the single sentencing proceeding, especially since defendants therewill normally be represented by counsel, who bring efficiency
to the litigation (as well as equitable benefits).

III
Because I cannot agree that Congress has required federalcourts to impose enhanced sentences on the basis of prior

convictions a defendant can show to be constitutionally in-valid, I respectfully dissent.

7 Maleng v. Cook, 490 U. S. 488 (1989), holding that a federal habeas
court has jurisdiction to entertain a defendant's attack on a sentence to the
extent it was enhanced by a prior, allegedly unconstitutional conviction,
"express[ed] no view on the extent to which the [prior] conviction itself
may be subject to challenge in the attack upon the . . . sentenc[e] which it
was used to enhance." Id., at 494 (citing 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 Rule 9(a)).
Court of Appeals decisions postdating Maleng have uniformly read it as
consistent with the view that federal habeas courts may review prior convictions relied upon for sentence enhancement and grant appropriate relief. See Collins v. Hesse, 957 F. 2d 746, 748 (CA10 1992) (discussing Maleng and citing cases). In addition, depending on the circumstances, the
writ of coram nobis may be available to challenge a prior conviction relied
upon at sentencing, see United States v. Morgan, 346 U. S. 502 (1954);
Crank v. Duckworth, 905 F. 2d 1090, 1091 (CA7 1990); Lewis v. United
States, 902 F. 2d 576, 577 (CA7 1990), and, if successful, the defendant may
petition the sentencing court for reconsideration of the enhanced sentence,
see Restatement (Second) of Judgments $ 16 (1982).

POSTERS `N' THINGS, LTD., et al. v.UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 92-903. Argued October 5, 1993--Decided May 23, 1994
Upon searching petitioner Acty's residence and the premises of her business, petitioner Posters `N' Things, Ltd., officers seized, among other
things, pipes, "bongs," scales, "roach clips," drug diluents, and advertisements describing various drug-related products sold by petitioners.
Petitioners were indicted on, and convicted in the District Court of, a
number of charges, including the use of an interstate conveyance as part
of a scheme to sell drug paraphernalia in violation of former 21 U. S. C.

$ 857(a)(1), a provision of the Mail Order Drug Paraphernalia Control
Act. In affirming, the Court of Appeals held, inter alia, that $ 857 requires proof of scienter and that the Act is not unconstitutionally vague.

Held:

1. Section 857 requires proof of scienter. Section $ 857(d)--which,
among other things, defines "drug paraphernalia" as any equipment
"primarily intended or designed for use" with illegal drugs--does not
serve as the basis for a subjective-intent requirement on the part of the
defendant, but merely establishes objective standards for determining
what constitutes drug paraphernalia: The "designed for use" element
refers to the manufacturer's design, while the "primarily intended . . .
for use" standard refers generally to an item's likely use. However,
neither this conclusion nor the absence of the word "knowingly" in

$ 857(d)'s text means that Congress intended to dispense entirely with a
scienter requirement. Rather, $ 857(a)(1) is properly construed under
this Court's decisions as requiring the Government to prove that the
defendant knowingly made use of an interstate conveyance as part of a
scheme to sell items that he knew were likely to be used with illegal
drugs. It need not prove specific knowledge that the items are "drug
paraphernalia" within the statute's meaning. Pp. 516-525.

2. Section 857 is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to petitioners, since $ 857(d) is sufficiently determinate with respect to the items
it lists as constituting per se drug paraphernalia, including many of the
items involved in this case; since $ 857(e) sets forth objective criteria for
assessing whether items constitute drug paraphernalia; and since the
scienter requirement herein inferred assists in avoiding any vagueness
problem. Because petitioners operated a full-scale "head shop" devoted

substantially to the sale of drug paraphernalia, the Court need not address $ 857's possible application to a legitimate merchant selling only
items--such as scales, razor blades, and mirrors--that may be used for
legitimate as well as illegitimate purposes. Pp. 525-526.

3. Petitioner Acty's other contentions are not properly before the
Court. P. 527.

969 F. 2d 652, affirmed.

Blackmun, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist,
C. J., and Stevens, O'Connor, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined.
Scalia, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Kennedy
and Thomas, JJ., joined, post, p. 527.

Alfredo Parrish argued the cause for petitioners. Withhim on the brief was Elizabeth Kruidenier.

Deputy Solicitor General Bryson argued the cause forthe United States. With him on the brief were

SolicitorGeneral Days, Acting Assistant Attorney General Keeney,

Robert A. Long, Jr., and Joel M. Gershowitz.

Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this case we must address the scienter requirement ofthe Mail Order Drug Paraphernalia Control Act, Pub. L. 99-

570, Tit. I, $ 1822, 100 Stat. 3207-51, formerly codified, asamended, at 21 U. S. C. $ 857, and the question whether the
Act is unconstitutionally vague as applied to petitioners.

I
In 1977, petitioner Lana Christine Acty formed petitionerPosters `N' Things, Ltd. (Posters), an Iowa corporation.

The corporation operated three businesses, a diet-aid store,an art gallery, and a general merchandise outlet originally
called "Forbidden Fruit," but later renamed "World WideImports." Law enforcement authorities received complaints that the merchandise outlet was selling drug para-phernalia. Other officers investigating drug cases found
drug diluents (chemicals used to "cut" or dilute illegal drugs)and other drug paraphernalia that had been purchased from
Forbidden Fruit.

Opinion of the Court
In March 1990, officers executed warrants to search pe-titioners' business premises and Acty's residence. They

seized various items, including pipes, bongs,1 scales, roachclips,

2 and drug diluents including mannitol and inositol.

The officers also seized cash, business records, and catalogsand advertisements describing products sold by petitioners.

The advertisements offered for sale such products as "CokeKits," "Free Base Kits,"

3 and diluents sold under the names

"PseudoCaine" and "Procaine."Indictments on a number of charges relating to the sale of

drug paraphernalia eventually were returned against peti-tioners and George Michael Moore, Acty's husband. A joint
trial took place before a jury in the United States DistrictCourt for the Southern District of Iowa.

Petitioners were convicted of using an interstate convey-ance as part of a scheme to sell drug paraphernalia, in violation of former 21 U. S. C. $ 857(a)(1), and of conspiring tocommit that offense, in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 371. Petitioner Acty also was convicted of aiding and abetting themanufacture and distribution of cocaine, in violation of 21
U. S. C. $ 841(a)(1); investing income derived from a drugoffense, in violation of 21 U. S. C. $ 854; money laundering,
in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 1956(a)(1); and engaging in mone-tary transactions with the proceeds of unlawful activity, in
violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 1957. Acty was sentenced to im-prisonment for 108 months, to be followed by a 5-year term

partially filled with liquid and a smaller tube ending in a bowl, used often

2 The statute defines "roach clips" as "objects used to hold burning material, such as a marihuana cigarette, that has become too small or too short
to be held in the hand." 21 U. S. C. $ 857(d)(5).

The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuitaffirmed the convictions. 969 F. 2d 652 (1992). Because of

II
Congress enacted the Mail Order Drug ParaphernaliaControl Act as part of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986,

Pub. L. 99-570, 100 Stat. 3207. As originally enacted, andas applicable in this case, the statute, 21 U. S. C. $ 857(a),

5

provides:

"It is unlawful for any person--"(1) to make use of the services of the Postal Service

or other interstate conveyance as part of a scheme tosell drug paraphernalia;

"(2) to offer for sale and transportation in interstateor foreign commerce drug paraphernalia; or
"(3) to import or export drug paraphernalia."
Section 857(b) provides that anyone convicted under thestatute shall be imprisoned for not more than three years

and fined not more than $100,000.

4 Compare the decision of the Eighth Circuit in this case with United
States v. Mishra, 979 F. 2d 301 (CA3 1992); United States v. Murphy, 977
F. 2d 503 (CA10 1992); United States v. Schneiderman, 968 F. 2d 1564

Items of Drug Paraphernalia, 869 F. 2d 955 (CA6), cert. denied, 493 U. S.
933 (1989).

5 In 1990, Congress repealed $ 857 and replaced it with 21 U. S. C. $ 863

(1988 ed., Supp. IV). See Crime Control Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101-647,

$ 2401, 104 Stat. 4858. The language of $ 863 is identical to that of former

$ 857 except in the general description of the offense. Section 863(a)
makes it unlawful for any person "(1) to sell or offer for sale drug paraphernalia; (2) to use the mails or any other facility of interstate commerce to transport drug paraphernalia; or (3) to import or export drug
paraphernalia."

Opinion of the Court

A
Section 857(a) does not contain an express scienter requirement. Some courts, however, have located a scienter
requirement in the statute's definitional provision, $ 857(d),
which defines the term "drug paraphernalia" as "any equipment, product, or material of any kind which is primarily
intended or designed for use" with illegal drugs.6 Petitioners argue that the term "primarily intended" in this provision establishes a subjective-intent requirement on the part
of the defendant. We disagree, and instead adopt the Gov6 Section 857(d) provides in full:
"The term `drug paraphernalia' means any equipment, product, or material of any kind which is primarily intended or designed for use in manufacturing, compounding, converting, concealing, producing, processing,
preparing, injecting, ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise introducing into the
human body a controlled substance, possession of which is unlawful under
the Controlled Substances Act (title II of Public Law 91-513) [21 U. S. C.

$$ 801 et seq.]. It includes items primarily intended or designed for use in
ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise introducing marijuana, cocaine, hashish,
hashish oil, PCP, or amphetamines into the human body, such as--

"(1) metal, wooden, acrylic, glass, stone, plastic, or ceramic pipes with
or without screens, permanent screens, hashish heads, or punctured
metal bowls;

"(2) water pipes;
"(3) carburetion tubes and devices;
"(4) smoking and carburetion masks;
"(5) roach clips: meaning objects used to hold burning material, such as
a marihuana cigarette, that has become too small or too short to be held
in the hand;

"(6) miniature spoons with level capacities of one-tenth cubic centimeter
or less;

"(7) chamber pipes;
"(8) carburetor pipes;
"(9) electric pipes;
"(10) air-driven pipes;
"(11) chillums;
"(12) bongs;
"(13) ice pipes or chillers;
"(14) wired cigarette papers; or
"(15) cocaine freebase kits."

518 POSTERS `N' THINGS, LTD. v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
ernment's position that $ 857(d) establishes objective stand-ards for determining what constitutes drug paraphernalia.

Section 857(d) identifies two categories of drug parapher-nalia: items "primarily intended . . . for use" with controlled
substances and items "designed for use" with such substances. This Court's decision in Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 500 (1982), governs the "designed for use" prong of $ 857(d). In that case,the Court considered an ordinance requiring a license for the

sale of items "designed or marketed for use with illegal can-nabis or drugs," and concluded that the alternative "designed . . . for use" standard referred to "the design of the
manufacturer, not the intent of the retailer or customer."
Id., at 501. An item is "designed for use," this Court explained, if it "is principally used with illegal drugs by virtue
of its objective features, i. e., features designed by the manufacturer." Ibid.

The objective characteristics of some items establish that
they are designed specifically for use with controlled substances. Such items, including bongs, cocaine freebase kits,
and certain kinds of pipes, have no other use besides contrived ones (such as use of a bong as a flower vase). Items
that meet the "designed for use" standard constitute drug
paraphernalia irrespective of the knowledge or intent of one
who sells or transports them. See United States v. Mishra,
979 F. 2d 301, 308 (CA3 1992); United States v. Schneiderman, 968 F. 2d 1564, 1567 (CA2 1992), cert. denied, 507 U. S.
921 (1993). Accordingly, the "designed for use" element of

$ 857(d) does not establish a scienter requirement with respect to sellers such as petitioners.

The "primarily intended . . . for use" language of $ 857(d)
presents a more difficult problem. The language might be
understood to refer to the state of mind of the defendant
(here, the seller), and thus to require an intent on the part
of the defendant that the items at issue be used with drugs.
Some Courts of Appeals have adopted this construction, see

United States v. 57,261 Items of Drug Paraphernalia, 869F. 2d 955, 957 (CA6), cert. denied, 493 U. S. 933 (1989), and
this Court in Hoffman Estates interpreted the arguably par-allel phrase "marketed for use" as describing "a retailer's
intentional display and marketing of merchandise," 455 U. S.,at 502, and thus requiring scienter. On the other hand,
there is greater ambiguity in the phrase "primarily intended. . . for use" than in the phrase "marketed for use." The
term "primarily intended" could refer to the intent of nondefendants, including manufacturers, distributors, retailers,
buyers, or users. Several considerations lead us to concludethat "primarily intended . . . for use" refers to a product's

likely use rather than to the defendant's state of mind.First, the structure of the statute supports an objective
interpretation of the "primarily intended . . . for use" stand-ard. Section 857(d) states that drug paraphernalia "includes
items primarily intended or designed for use in" consumingspecified illegal drugs, "

such as . . . ," followed by a list of 15
items constituting per se drug paraphernalia. The inclusion
of the "primarily intended" term along with the "designedfor use" term in the introduction to the list of

per se paraphernalia suggests that at least some of the per se itemscould be "primarily intended" for use with illegal drugs irrespective of a particular defendant's intent--that is, as anobjective matter. Moreover, $ 857(e) lists eight objective
factors that may be considered "in addition to all otherlogically relevant factors" in "determining whether an item
constitutes drug paraphernalia." 7 These factors generally

7 Section 857(e) provides:
"In determining whether an item constitutes drug paraphernalia, in
addition to all other logically relevant factors, the following may be
considered:

"(1) instructions, oral or written, provided with the item concerning
its use;

520 POSTERS `N' THINGS, LTD. v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
focus on the actual use of the item in the community. Con-gress did not include among the listed factors a defendant's

statements about his intent or other factors directly estab-lishing subjective intent. This omission is significant in
light of the fact that the parallel list contained in the DrugEnforcement Administration's Model Drug Paraphernalia
Act, on which $ 857 was based,8 includes among the relevantfactors "[s]tatements by an owner . . . concerning [the object's] use" and "[d]irect or circumstantial evidence of theintent of an owner . . . to deliver it to persons whom he
knows, or should reasonably know, intend to use the objectto facilitate a violation of this Act."

9

An objective construction of the definitional provision alsofinds support in $ 857(f ), which establishes an exemption for

items "traditionally intended for use with tobacco prod-ucts."

10 An item's "traditional" use is not based on the sub"(2) descriptive materials accompanying the item which explain or depict its use;

"(3) national and local advertising concerning its use;
"(4) the manner in which the item is displayed for sale;
"(5) whether the owner, or anyone in control of the item, is a legitimate
supplier of like or related items to the community, such as a licensed distributor or dealer of tobacco products;

"(6) direct or circumstantial evidence of the ratio of sales of the item(s)
to the total sales of the business enterprise;

"(7) the existence and scope of legitimate uses of the item in the community; and

"(8) expert testimony concerning its use."
8 See Schneiderman, 968 F. 2d, at 1566.

9 See Brief for United States 6a-7a. The Model Act lists 14 factors to

be considered in addition to all other logically relevant factors in determining whether an object is drug paraphernalia. Several of the factors are
similar or identical to those listed in $ 857(e).

10 Section 857(f) provides:

"This section shall not apply to--

"(1) any person authorized by local, State, or Federal law to manufacture, possess, or distribute such items; or

"(2) any item that, in the normal lawful course of business, is imported,
exported, transported, or sold through the mail or by any other means,

Opinion of the Court
jective intent of a particular defendant. In 1988, Congressadded the word "traditionally" in place of "primarily" in the

$ 857(f) exemption in order to "clarif[y]" the meaning of theexemption. Pub. L. 100-690, Tit. VI, $ 6485, 102 Stat. 4384.
Congress' characterization of the amendment as merely"clarifying" the law suggests that the original phrase--"primarily intended"--was not a reference to the fundamentallydifferent concept of a defendant's subjective intent.

Finally, an objective construction of the phrase "primarilyintended" is consistent with the natural reading of similar
language in definitional provisions of other federal criminalstatutes. See 18 U. S. C. $ 921(a)(17)(B) ("armor piercing
ammunition" excludes any projectile that is "primarily in-tended" to be used for sporting purposes, as found by the
Secretary of the Treasury); 21 U. S. C. $ 860(d)(2) (1988 ed.,Supp. V) ("youth center" means a recreational facility "intended primarily for use by persons under 18 years of age").We conclude that the term "primarily intended . . . for use"
in $ 857(d) is to be understood objectively and refers gen-erally to an item's likely use.

11 Rather than serving as the

and traditionally intended for use with tobacco products, including any
pipe, paper, or accessory."

11 Although we describe the definition of "primarily intended" as "objective," we note that it is a relatively particularized definition, reaching beyond the category of items that are likely to be used with drugs by virtue
of their objective features. Among the factors that are relevant to
whether an item constitutes drug paraphernalia are "instructions, oral or
written, provided with the item concerning its use," $ 857(e)(1), and "the
manner in which the item is displayed for sale," $ 857(e)(4). Thus, while
scales or razor blades as a general class may not be designed specifically
for use with drugs, a subset of those items in a particular store may be
"primarily intended" for use with drugs by virtue of the circumstances of
their display and sale.

We disagree with Justice Scalia insofar as he would hold that a box
of paper clips is converted into drug paraphernalia by the mere fact that
a customer mentions to the seller that the paper clips will make excellent
roach clips. Section 857(d) states that items "primarily intended" for use
with drugs constitute drug paraphernalia, indicating that it is the likely

Opinion of the Court
basis for a subjective scienter requirement, the phrase "pri-marily intended or designed for use" in the definitional provision establishes objective standards for determining whatconstitutes drug paraphernalia.

12

B
Neither our conclusion that Congress intended an objec-tive construction of the "primarily intended" language in

$ 857(d), nor the fact that Congress did not include the word"knowingly" in the text of $ 857, justifies the conclusion that
Congress intended to dispense entirely with a scienter re-quirement. This Court stated in

United States v. UnitedStates Gypsum Co., 438 U. S. 422, 438 (1978): "Certainly far

more than the simple omission of the appropriate phrasefrom the statutory definition is necessary to justify dispensing with an intent requirement." Even statutes creatingpublic welfare offenses generally require proof that the
defendant had knowledge of sufficient facts to alert him tothe probability of regulation of his potentially dangerous
conduct. See Staples v. United States, post, at 607, and n. 3;
use of customers generally, not any particular customer, that can render a
multiple-use item drug paraphernalia.

12 The legislative history of the Mail Order Drug Paraphernalia Control

Act consists of one House subcommittee hearing. See Hearing on H. R.
1625 before the Subcommittee on Crime of the House Committee on the
Judiciary, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986). We recognize that a colloquy with
the principal House sponsor of the Act during this hearing lends some
support to a subjective interpretation of the "primarily intended" language of $ 857(d). When asked to whose intent this language referred,
Rep. Levine initially stated: "The purpose of the language . . . is to identify
as clearly as possible the intent of manufacturer and the seller to market
a particular item as drug paraphernalia, subject to the interpretation of a
trial court." Id., at 48. When pressed further, he stated: "[I]t would be
the intent on the part of the defendant in a particular trial." Ibid. Given
the language and structure of the statute, we are not persuaded that these
comments of a single member at a subcommittee hearing are sufficient to
show a desire on the part of Congress to locate a scienter requirement in
the definitional provision of $ 857.

Opinion of the Court
United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U. S. 277, 281 (1943). Weconclude that $ 857 is properly construed as containing a

scienter requirement.We turn to the nature of that requirement in this statute.
In United States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394, 404 (1980), this
Court distinguished between the mental states of " `pur-pose' " and " `knowledge,' " explaining,

id., at 408, that, "except in narrow classes of offenses, proof that the defendantacted knowingly is sufficient to support a conviction." In

Bailey, the Court read into the federal escape statute, 18U. S. C. $ 751(a), a requirement that "an escapee knew his
actions would result in his leaving physical confinement
without permission," rejecting a heightened mens rea that
would have required " `an intent to avoid confinement.' "
444 U. S., at 408. Similarly, in United States v. United
States Gypsum Co., 438 U. S., at 444, the Court addressed
the question whether a criminal violation of the Sherman
Act "requires, in addition to proof of anticompetitive effects,
a demonstration that the disputed conduct was undertaken
with the `conscious object' of producing such effects, or
whether it is sufficient that the conduct is shown to have
been undertaken with knowledge that the proscribed effects
would most likely follow." The Court concluded that "action
undertaken with knowledge of its probable consequences . . .
can be a sufficient predicate for a finding of criminal liability
under the antitrust laws." Ibid.

As in Bailey and United States Gypsum, we conclude that
a defendant must act knowingly in order to be liable under

$ 857. Requiring that a seller of drug paraphernalia act
with the "purpose" that the items be used with illegal drugs
would be inappropriate. The purpose of a seller of drug paraphernalia is to sell his product; the seller is indifferent as
to whether that product ultimately is used in connection with
illegal drugs or otherwise. If $ 857 required a purpose that
the items be used with illegal drugs, individuals could avoid
liability for selling bongs and cocaine freebase kits simply by

establishing that they lacked the "conscious object" that theitems be used with illegal drugs.

Further, we do not think that the knowledge standard inthis context requires knowledge on the defendant's part that
a particular customer actually will use an item of drug para-phernalia with illegal drugs. It is sufficient that the defendant be aware that customers in general are likely to use themerchandise with drugs. Therefore, the Government must
establish that the defendant knew that the items at issueare likely to be used with illegal drugs. Cf.

United StatesGypsum, 438 U. S., at 444 (knowledge of "probable consequences" sufficient for conviction).13 A conviction under$ 857(a)(1), then, requires the Government to prove that the
defendant knowingly made use of an interstate conveyanceas part of a scheme to sell items that he knew were likely to
be used with illegal drugs.Finally, although the Government must establish that the
defendant knew that the items at issue are likely to be usedwith illegal drugs, it need not prove specific knowledge that
the items are "drug paraphernalia" within the meaning ofthe statute. Cf.

Hamling v. United States, 418 U. S. 87(1974) (statute prohibiting mailing of obscene materials does

13 The knowledge standard that we adopt parallels the standard applied
by those courts that have based $ 857's scienter requirement on the "primarily intended" language of the definitional provision. See Mishra, 979
F. 2d, at 307 (Government must prove that defendant "contemplated, or
reasonably expected under the circumstances, that the item sold or offered
for sale would be used with illegal drugs"); Schneiderman, 968 F. 2d, at
1567 (Government must prove that defendant "knew there was a strong
probability the items would be so used"); 57,261 Items of Drug Paraphernalia, 869 F. 2d, at 957 (Government must prove defendant's "knowledge
that there is a strong probability that the items will be used" with illegal
drugs). The scienter requirement that we have inferred applies with respect to all items of drug paraphernalia, while at least some of the lower
courts appear to have confined their scienter requirement to those items
"primarily intended" (but not "designed") for use with illegal drugs. See,
e. g., Schneiderman, 968 F. 2d, at 1567.

not require proof that defendant knew the materials at issuemet the legal definition of "obscenity"). As in Hamling, it

is sufficient for the Government to show that the defendant"knew the character and nature of the materials" with which
he dealt. Id., at 123.In light of the above, we conclude that the jury instructions given by the District Court adequately conveyed thelegal standards for petitioners' convictions under $ 857.

III
Petitioners argue that $ 857 is unconstitutionally vague asapplied to them in this case. "[T]he void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offensewith sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that doesnot encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement."
Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357 (1983); see also
Grayned v. Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 108-109 (1972). What-ever its status as a general matter, we cannot say that $ 857

is unconstitutionally vague as applied in this case.First, the list of items in $ 857(d) constituting

per se drugparaphernalia provides individuals and law enforcement officers with relatively clear guidelines as to prohibited con-duct. With respect to the listed items, there can be little

14 The District Court instructed the jury that, in order to find petitioners
guilty, it was required to find that they "made use of [an] interstate conveyance knowingly as part of a scheme to sell drug paraphernalia," that
"the items in question constitute drug paraphernalia," defined as items
"primarily intended or designed for use" with illegal drugs, and that petitioners "knew the nature and character of the items." The District Court
elaborated on the knowledge requirement, describing it as "knowledge of
the defendants as to the nature, character, and use of the items being
sold or offered for sale at the store." App. 16-35. We think that the
instructions adequately informed the jury that it could convict petitioners
only if it found that they knew that the items at issue were likely to be
used with illegal drugs.

526 POSTERS `N' THINGS, LTD. v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
doubt that the statute is sufficiently determinate to meetconstitutional requirements. Many items involved in this

case--including bongs, roach clips, and pipes designed foruse with illegal drugs--are among the items specifically
listed in $ 857(d).

Second, $ 857(e) sets forth objective criteria for assessingwhether items constitute drug paraphernalia. These factors

minimize the possibility of arbitrary enforcement and assistin defining the sphere of prohibited conduct under the statute. See Mishra, 979 F. 2d, at 309; Schneiderman, 968 F. 2d,at 1568. Section 857(f )'s exemption for tobacco-related
products further limits the scope of the statute and precludes
its enforcement against legitimate sellers of lawful products.

Finally, the scienter requirement that we have inferred
in $ 857 assists in avoiding any vagueness problem. "[T]he
Court has recognized that a scienter requirement may mitigate a law's vagueness, especially with respect to the adequacy of notice . . . that [the] conduct is proscribed." Hoffman Estates, 455 U. S., at 499.

Section 857's application to multiple-use items--such as
scales, razor blades, and mirrors--may raise more serious
concerns. Such items may be used for legitimate as well
as illegitimate purposes, and "a certain degree of ambiguity
necessarily surrounds their classification." Mishra, 979
F. 2d, at 309. This case, however, does not implicate vagueness or other due process concerns with respect to such
items. Petitioners operated a full-scale "head shop," a business devoted substantially to the sale of products that clearly
constituted drug paraphernalia. The Court stated in Hoffman Estates: "The theoretical possibility that the village will
enforce its ordinance against a paper clip placed next to Rolling Stone magazine . . . is of no due process significance unless the possibility ripens into a prosecution." 455 U. S., at
503-504, n. 21. Similarly here, we need not address the possible application of $ 857 to a legitimate merchant engaging
in the sale of only multiple-use items.

Petitioner Acty's other contentions are not properly beforethe Court. First, she argues that she was improperly convicted of aiding and abetting the manufacture and distribu-tion of cocaine because the jury instructions created a "presumption" that certain items of drug paraphernalia "wereintended for manufacturing with a controlled substance."
Brief for Petitioners 17. This argument was neither raisedin nor addressed by the Court of Appeals. See Lawn v.
United States, 355 U. S. 339, 362-363, n. 16 (1958). Second,Acty asserts that her convictions for money laundering, investing income derived from a drug offense, and engaging inmonetary transactions with the proceeds of unlawful activity
must be reversed. These contentions were not presented inthe petition for writ of certiorari, and therefore they are not
properly raised here. See this Court's Rule 14.1(a). Fi-nally, the petition presented the question whether the proof
was adequate to support Acty's conviction for aiding andabetting the manufacture and distribution of cocaine; but
petitioners' brief on the merits fails to address the issue andtherefore abandons it. See

Russell v. United States, 369U. S. 749, 754, n. 7 (1962).

Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals isaffirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Kennedy and
Justice Thomas join, concurring in the judgment.

I agree with the Court that the sale of items likely to beused for drug purposes, with knowledge of such likely use,

violates former 21 U. S. C. $ 857; and that a subjective intenton the part of the defendant that the items sold be used for
drug purposes is not necessary for conviction. That is allthe scienter analysis necessary to decide the present case.
The Court goes further, however, and says, ante, at 518-522,that such a subjective intent is not only not necessary for

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
conviction but is not sufficient for conviction--i. e., that thesale of an item with the

intent that it be used for drug purposes does not constitute a violation. I disagree. In myview, the statutory language "primarily intended . . . for use"

causes a sale to be a sale of drug paraphernalia where the
seller intends the item to be used for drug purposes. A rejection of that view, if consistently applied, would cause "primarily intended or designed for use" to mean nothing more
than "designed for use." While redundancy is not unheard
of in statutory draftsmanship, neither is it favored in statutory interpretation. Kungys v. United States, 485 U. S. 759,
778 (1988).

Some of the provisions of $ 857(e), which describes factors
that may be considered in determining whether an item constitutes drug paraphernalia, clearly suggest that what is not
covered paraphernalia by nature can be made such by the
seller's intent.* Section 857(e)(1) lists as one of the relevant
factors "instructions, oral or written, provided with the item
concerning its use." This envisions, I think, that a drugstore owner who instructs the purchaser how to use the purchased drinking straw or razor blade in the ingestion of
drugs converts what would otherwise be a lawful sale into a
sale of drug paraphernalia. Section 857(e)(4) lists as a relevant factor "the manner in which the item is displayed for
sale." That would surely not change the nature of the item,
but it would cast light upon the use intended by the person
who is selling and displaying it. And $ 857(e)(5) lists as a
relevant factor "whether the owner . . . is a legitimate sup*For purposes of the present case, all we need decide is that the seller's
intent will qualify. It would also seem true, however (since the statute
contains no limitation on whose intent--manufacturer's, seller's, or buyer's--can qualify), that the buyer's intended use will cause an otherwise
harmless item to be drug paraphernalia. To convict a seller on such a
basis, of course, the scienter requirement of the statute would require that
the seller have known of such intended use.

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
plier of like or related items." Again, that casts light uponnothing but the seller's intent regarding use.

On first glance, the Court's claim that "primarily intended"does not refer to the defendant's state of mind seems to be
supported by $ 857(f)(2), which exempts from the entire sec-tion the sale, "in the normal lawful course of business," of
items "traditionally intended for use with tobacco products."This might be thought to suggest that the section applies
only to categories of items, and not at all to items sold witha particular intent. On further consideration, however, it is
apparent that $ 857(f)(2) militates against, rather than infavor of, the Court's view. Unless unlawful intent could
have produced liability, there would have been no need forthe exception. Tobacco pipes are tobacco pipes, and cigarette paper is cigarette paper; neither could possibly meetthe Court's test of being "items . . . likely to be used with
illegal drugs," ante, at 524. Only the criminalizing effectof an unlawful intent to sell for drug use puts tobacconists
at risk. Because of the ready (though not ordinary) use ofitems such as cigarette paper and tobacco pipes for drug purposes, tobacconists would have been in constant danger ofbeing accused of having an unlawful intent in their sales--so
Congress gave them what amounts to a career exception.Through most of the Court's opinion, an item's "likely use"
seems to refer to the objective features of the item that ren-der it usable for one purpose or another. At the very end
of the relevant discussion, however, in apparent response tothe difficulties presented by the factors listed in $ 857(e), one
finds, in a footnote, the following:

"Although we describe the definition of `primarily intended' as `objective,' we note that it is a relatively par-ticularized definition, reaching beyond the category of

items that are likely to be used with drugs by virtue oftheir objective features. . . . Thus, while scales or razor
blades as a general class may not be designed specifi511US2 Unit: $U52 [07-11-99 18:27:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
cally for use with drugs, a subset of those items in aparticular store may be `primarily intended' for use with

drugs by virtue of the circumstances of their display andsale." Ante, at 521, n. 11.

If by the "circumstances of . . . sale" the Court means toinclude the circumstance that the seller says, "You will find
these scales terrific for weighing drugs," or that the buyerasks, "Do you have any scales suitable for weighing
drugs?"--then there is really very little, if any, differencebetween the Court's position and mine. Intent can only be
known, of course, through objective manifestations. If whatthe Court means by "a relatively particularized objective
definition" is that all objective manifestations of the seller'sintent are to be considered part of the "circumstances of
sale," then there is no difference whatever between us(though I persist in thinking it would be simpler to say that
"intended for sale" means "intended for sale" than to inventthe concept of "a relatively particularized objective intent").
If, on the other hand, only some and not all objective mani-festations of the seller's intent are to be considered part of
the "circumstances of sale" (manner of display, for example,but not manner of oral promotion), then the Court ought to
provide some description of those that do and those thatdo not, and (if possible) some reason for the distinction.

Finally, I cannot avoid noting that the only available legis-lative history--statements by the very Congressman who introduced the text in question, see ante, at 522, n. 12--unam-biguously supports my view. I point that out, not because
I think those statements are pertinent to our analysis, butbecause it displays once again that our acceptance of the supposed teachings of legislative history is more sporadic thanour professions of allegiance to it. See Thunder Basin Coal
Co. v. Reich, 510 U. S. 200, 219 (1994) (Scalia, J., concur-ring in part and concurring in judgment); Wisconsin Public

BFP v. RESOLUTION TRUST CORPORATION, as

receiver of IMPERIAL FEDERAL SAVINGSASSOCIATION,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 92-1370. Argued December 7, 1993--Decided May 23, 1994
Petitioner BFP took title to a California home subject to, inter alia, a

deed of trust in favor of Imperial Savings Association. After Imperial
entered a notice of default because its loan was not being serviced, the
home was purchased by respondent Osborne for $433,000 at a properly
noticed foreclosure sale. BFP soon petitioned for bankruptcy and, acting as a debtor in possession, filed a complaint to set aside the sale to
Osborne as a fraudulent transfer, claiming that the home was worth
over $725,000 when sold and thus was not exchanged for a "reasonably
equivalent value" under 11 U. S. C. $ 548(a)(2). The Bankruptcy Court
granted summary judgment to Imperial. The District Court affirmed
the dismissal, and a bankruptcy appellate panel affirmed the judgment,
holding that consideration received in a noncollusive and regularly conducted nonjudicial foreclosure sale establishes "reasonably equivalent
value" as a matter of law. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: A "reasonably equivalent value" for foreclosed real property is

the price in fact received at the foreclosure sale, so long as all the
requirements of the State's foreclosure law have been complied with.
Pp. 535-549.

(a) Contrary to the positions taken by some Courts of Appeals, fair
market value is not necessarily the benchmark against which determination of reasonably equivalent value is to be measured. It may be presumed that Congress acted intentionally when it used the term "fair
market value" elsewhere in the Bankruptcy Code but not in $ 548, particularly when the omission entails replacing standard legal terminology
with a neologism. Moreover, fair market value presumes market conditions that, by definition, do not obtain in the forced-sale context, since
property sold within the time and manner strictures of state-prescribed
foreclosure is simply worth less than property sold without such restrictions. "Reasonably equivalent value" also cannot be read to mean a
"reasonable" or "fair" forced-sale price, such as a percentage of fair market value. To specify a federal minimum sale price beyond what state
foreclosure law requires would extend bankruptcy law well beyond the
traditional field of fraudulent transfers and upset the coexistence that

Syllabus
fraudulent transfer law and foreclosure law have enjoyed for over 400
years. While, under fraudulent transfer law, a "grossly inadequate
price" raises a rebuttable presumption of actual fraudulent intent, it is
black letter foreclosure law that, when a State's procedures are followed,
the mere inadequacy of a foreclosure sale price is no basis for setting
the sale aside. Absent clearer textual guidance than the phrase "reasonably equivalent value"--a phrase entirely compatible with preexisting practice--the Court will not presume that Congress intended
to displace traditional state regulation with an interpretation that would
profoundly affect the important state interest in the security and stability of title to real property. Pp. 535-545.

(b) The conclusion reached here does not render $ 548(a)(2) superfluous. The "reasonably equivalent value" criterion will continue to have
independent meaning outside the foreclosure context, and $ 548(a)(2) will
continue to be an exclusive means of invalidating foreclosure sales that,
while not intentionally fraudulent, nevertheless fail to comply with all
governing state laws. Pp. 545-546.

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether the considerationreceived from a noncollusive, real estate mortgage foreclosure sale conducted in conformance with applicable state lawconclusively satisfies the Bankruptcy Code's requirement

scheduled a properly noticed foreclosure sale. The foreclo-sure proceedings were temporarily delayed by the filing of

534 BFP v. RESOLUTION TRUST CORPORATION

Opinion of the Court
foreclosure proceeding was completed at a foreclosure sale
on July 12, 1989. The home was purchased by respondent
Paul Osborne for $433,000.

In October 1989, petitioner filed for bankruptcy under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U. S. C. $$ 1101-1174.
Acting as a debtor in possession, petitioner filed a complaint
in Bankruptcy Court seeking to set aside the conveyance of
the home to respondent Osborne on the grounds that the
foreclosure sale constituted a fraudulent transfer under $ 548
of the Code, 11 U. S. C. $ 548. Petitioner alleged that the
home was actually worth over $725,000 at the time of the
sale to Osborne. Acting on separate motions, the Bankruptcy Court dismissed the complaint as to the private
respondents and granted summary judgment in favor of
Imperial. The Bankruptcy Court found, inter alia, that the
foreclosure sale had been conducted in compliance with California law and was neither collusive nor fraudulent. In an
unpublished opinion, the District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy Court's granting of the private respondents' motion
to dismiss. A divided bankruptcy appellate panel affirmed
the Bankruptcy Court's entry of summary judgment for Imperial. 132 B. R. 748 (1991). Applying the analysis set
forth in In re Madrid, 21 B. R. 424 (Bkrtcy. App. Pan. CA9
1982), affirmed on other grounds, 725 F. 2d 1197 (CA9), cert.
denied, 469 U. S. 833 (1984), the panel majority held that a
"non-collusive and regularly conducted nonjudicial foreclosure sale . . . cannot be challenged as a fraudulent conveyance
because the consideration received in such a sale establishes
`reasonably equivalent value' as a matter of law." 132 B. R.,
at 750.

Petitioner sought review of both decisions in the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which consolidated the appeals. The Court of Appeals affirmed. In re BFP, 974

Opinion of the Court

II
Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U. S. C. $ 548, setsforth the powers of a trustee in bankruptcy (or, in a Chapter

11 case, a debtor in possession) to avoid fraudulent trans-fers.

2 It permits to be set aside not only transfers infected

by actual fraud but certain other transfers as well--so-calledconstructively fraudulent transfers. The constructive fraud

provision at issue in this case applies to transfers by insol-vent debtors. It permits avoidance if the trustee can establish (1) that the debtor had an interest in property; (2) thata transfer of that interest occurred within one year of the
filing of the bankruptcy petition; (3) that the debtor was in-solvent at the time of the transfer or became insolvent as a
result thereof; and (4) that the debtor received "less than areasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer."
11 U. S. C. $ 548(a)(2)(A). It is the last of these four ele-ments that presents the issue in the case before us.

Section 548 applies to any "transfer," which includes "fore-closure of the debtor's equity of redemption." 11 U. S. C.

$ 101(54) (1988 ed., Supp. IV). Of the three critical terms"reasonably equivalent value," only the last is defined:
"value" means, for purposes of $ 548, "property, or satisfac-tion or securing of a . . . debt of the debtor," 11 U. S. C.

2 Title 11 U. S. C. $ 548 provides in relevant part:
"(a) The trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in
property, or any obligation incurred by the debtor, that was made or incurred on or within one year before the date of the filing of the petition,
if the debtor voluntarily or involuntarily--

"(1) made such transfer or incurred such obligation with actual intent
to hinder, delay, or defraud any entity to which the debtor was or became,
on or after the date that such transfer was made or such obligation was
incurred, indebted; or

"(2)(A) received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for
such transfer or obligation; and

"(B)(i) was insolvent on the date that such transfer was made or such
obligation was incurred, or became insolvent as a result of such transfer
or obligation . . . ."

Opinion of the Court

$ 548(d)(2)(A). The question presented here, therefore, iswhether the amount of debt (to the first and second lienholders) satisfied at the foreclosure sale (viz., a total of $433,000)is "reasonably equivalent" to the worth of the real estate
conveyed. The Courts of Appeals have divided on the
meaning of those undefined terms. In Durrett v. Washington Nat. Ins. Co., 621 F. 2d 201 (1980), the Fifth Circuit,
interpreting a provision of the old Bankruptcy Act analogousto $ 548(a)(2), held that a foreclosure sale that yielded 57% of

the property's fair market value could be set aside, and indi-cated in dicta that any such sale for less than 70% of fair
market value should be invalidated. Id., at 203-204. This
"Durrett rule" has continued to be applied by some courts
under $ 548 of the new Bankruptcy Code. See In re Littleton, 888 F. 2d 90, 92, n. 5 (CA11 1989). In In re Bundles,
856 F. 2d 815, 820 (1988), the Seventh Circuit rejected the
Durrett rule in favor of a case-by-case, "all facts and circumstances" approach to the question of reasonably equivalent
value, with a rebuttable presumption that the foreclosure
sale price is sufficient to withstand attack under $ 548(a)(2).
856 F. 2d, at 824-825; see also In re Grissom, 955 F. 2d 1440,
1445-1446 (CA11 1992). In this case the Ninth Circuit,
agreeing with the Sixth Circuit, see In re Winshall Settler's
Trust, 758 F. 2d 1136, 1139 (CA6 1985), adopted the position
first put forward in In re Madrid, 21 B. R. 424 (Bkrtcy. App.
Pan. CA9 1982), affirmed on other grounds, 725 F. 2d 1197
(CA9), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 833 (1984), that the consideration received at a noncollusive, regularly conducted real estate foreclosure sale constitutes a reasonably equivalent
value under $ 548(a)(2)(A). The Court of Appeals acknowledged that it "necessarily part[ed] from the positions taken
by the Fifth Circuit in Durrett . . . and the Seventh Circuit
in Bundles." 974 F. 2d, at 1148.

In contrast to the approach adopted by the Ninth Circuit
in the present case, both Durrett and Bundles refer to fair
market value as the benchmark against which determination

of reasonably equivalent value is to be measured. In thecontext of an otherwise lawful mortgage foreclosure sale of

real estate,3 such reference is in our opinion not consistentwith the text of the Bankruptcy Code. The term "fair market value," though it is a well-established concept, does notappear in $ 548. In contrast, $ 522, dealing with a debtor's
exemptions, specifically provides that, for purposes of thatsection, " `value' means fair market value as of the date of
the filing of the petition." 11 U. S. C. $ 522(a)(2). "Fairmarket value" also appears in the Code provision that defines the extent to which indebtedness with respect to anequity security is not forgiven for the purpose of determining whether the debtor's estate has realized taxable income.$ 346( j)(7)(B). Section 548, on the other hand, seemingly
goes out of its way to avoid that standard term. It mightreadily have said "received less than fair market value in
exchange for such transfer or obligation," or perhaps "lessthan a reasonable equivalent of fair market value." Instead,
it used the (as far as we are aware) entirely novel phrase"reasonably equivalent value." "[I]t is generally presumed
that Congress acts intentionally and purposely when itincludes particular language in one section of a statute
but omits it in another," Chicago v. Environmental Defense
Fund, ante, at 338 (internal quotation marks omitted),and that presumption is even stronger when the omission

entails the replacement of standard legal terminology with aneologism. One must suspect the language means that fair
market value cannot--or at least cannot always--be thebenchmark.

That suspicion becomes a certitude when one considersthat market value, as it is commonly understood, has no applicability in the forced-sale context; indeed, it is the very
antithesis of forced-sale value. "The market value of . . . a

piece of property is the price which it might be expected tobring if offered for sale in a fair market; not the price which

might be obtained on a sale at public auction or a sale forcedby the necessities of the owner, but such a price as would be

not compelled) to sell and a purchaser who desires to buy butis not compelled to take the particular . . . piece of property."
Black's Law Dictionary 971 (6th ed. 1990). In short, "fairmarket value" presumes market conditions that, by definition, simply do not obtain in the context of a forced sale.See,

e. g., East Bay Municipal Utility District v. Kieffer, 99Cal. App. 240, 255, 278 P. 476, 482 (1929), overruled on other

grounds by County of San Diego v. Miller, 13 Cal. 3d 684,532 P. 2d 139 (1975) (in bank);

Neither petitioner, petitioner's amici, nor any federalcourt adopting the

Durrett or the Bundles analysis has cometo grips with this glaring discrepancy between the factors

relevant to an appraisal of a property's market value, onthe one hand, and the strictures of the foreclosure process
on the other. Market value cannot be the criterion of equiv-alence in the foreclosure-sale context.

4 The language of

4 Our discussion assumes that the phrase "reasonably equivalent" means
"approximately equivalent," or "roughly equivalent." One could, we suppose, torture it into meaning "as close to equivalent as can reasonably be
expected"--in which event even a vast divergence from equivalent value
would be permissible so long as there is good reason for it. On such an
analysis, fair market value could be the criterion of equivalence, even in
a forced-sale context; the forced sale would be the reason why gross inequivalence is nonetheless reasonable equivalence. Such word-gaming
would deprive the criterion of all meaning. If "reasonably equivalent
value" means only "as close to equivalent value as is reasonable," the statute might as well have said "reasonably infinite value."

value in exchange") requires judicial inquiry into whetherthe foreclosed property was sold for a price that approximated its worth at the time of sale. An appraiser's recon-struction of "fair market value" could show what similar
property would be worth if it did not have to be sold within
the time and manner strictures of state-prescribed foreclo-sure. But property that

must be sold within those strictures is simply worth less. No one would pay as much toown such property as he would pay to own real estate that

could be sold at leisure and pursuant to normal marketingtechniques. And it is no more realistic to ignore that characteristic of the property (the fact that state foreclosure lawpermits the mortgagee to sell it at forced sale) than it is to
ignore other price-affecting characteristics (such as the fact
that state zoning law permits the owner of the neighboringlot to open a gas station).

state-law regulatory background and take due account of its
effect. "The existence and force and function of established

5 We are baffled by the dissent's perception of a "patent" difference between zoning and foreclosure laws insofar as impact upon property value
is concerned, post, at 557-558, n. 10. The only distinction we perceive is
that the former constitute permanent restrictions upon use of the subject
property, while the latter apply for a brief period of time and restrict only
the manner of its sale. This difference says nothing about how significantly the respective regimes affect the property's value when they are
operative. The dissent characterizes foreclosure rules as "merely procedural," and asserts that this renders them, unlike "substantive" zoning
regulations, irrelevant in bankruptcy. We are not sure we agree with the
characterization. But in any event, the cases relied on for this distinction
all address creditors' attempts to claim the benefit of state rules of law
(whether procedural or substantive) as property rights, in a bankruptcy
proceeding. See United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest
Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 370-371 (1988); Owen v. Owen, 500 U. S.

state laws, procedural or otherwise, are irrelevant to prebankruptcy valuation questions such as that presented by $ 548(a)(2)(A).

institutions of local government are always in the conscious-ness of lawmakers and, while their weight may vary, they

may never be completely overlooked in the task of interpre-tation."

Davies Warehouse Co. v. Bowles, 321 U. S. 144, 154
(1944). Cf. Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460-462
(1991).There is another artificially constructed criterion we

might look to instead of "fair market price." One mightjudge there to be such a thing as a "reasonable" or "fair"
forced-sale price. Such a conviction must lie behind the
Bundles inquiry into whether the state foreclosure proceedings "were calculated . . . to return to the debtor-mortgagor
his equity in the property." 856 F. 2d, at 824. And perhaps
that is what the courts that follow the Durrett rule have in
mind when they select 70% of fair market value as the outer
limit of "reasonably equivalent value" for forecloseable property (we have no idea where else such an arbitrary percentage could have come from). The problem is that such judgments represent policy determinations that the Bankruptcy
Code gives us no apparent authority to make. How closely
the price received in a forced sale is likely to approximate
fair market value depends upon the terms of the forced
sale--how quickly it may be made, what sort of public notice
must be given, etc. But the terms for foreclosure sale are
not standard. They vary considerably from State to State,
depending upon, among other things, how the particular
State values the divergent interests of debtor and creditor.
To specify a federal "reasonable" foreclosure-sale price is to
extend federal bankruptcy law well beyond the traditional
field of fraudulent transfers, into realms of policy where it
has not ventured before. Some sense of history is needed
to appreciate this.

The modern law of fraudulent transfers had its origin in
the Statute of 13 Elizabeth, which invalidated "covinous and
fraudulent" transfers designed "to delay, hinder or defraud
creditors and others." 13 Eliz., ch. 5 (1570). English courts

Opinion of the Court
soon developed the doctrine of "badges of fraud": proof by acreditor of certain objective facts (for example, a transfer to

a close relative, a secret transfer, a transfer of title withouttransfer of possession, or grossly inadequate consideration)
would raise a rebuttable presumption of actual fraudulent
intent. See Twyne's Case, 3 Coke Rep. 80b, 76 Eng. Rep.809 (K. B. 1601); O. Bump, Fraudulent Conveyances: A Treatise upon Conveyances Made by Debtors to Defraud Credi-tors 31-60 (3d ed. 1882). Every American bankruptcy law
has incorporated a fraudulent transfer provision; the 1898Act specifically adopted the language of the Statute of 13
Elizabeth. Bankruptcy Act of July 1, 1898, ch. 541, $ 67(e),
30 Stat. 564-565.

The history of foreclosure law also begins in England,
where courts of chancery developed the "equity of redemption"--the equitable right of a borrower to buy back, or redeem, property conveyed as security by paying the secured
debt on a later date than "law day," the original due date.
The courts' continued expansion of the period of redemption
left lenders in a quandary, since title to forfeited property
could remain clouded for years after law day. To meet this
problem, courts created the equitable remedy of foreclosure:
after a certain date the borrower would be forever foreclosed
from exercising his equity of redemption. This remedy was
called strict foreclosure because the borrower's entire interest in the property was forfeited, regardless of any accumulated equity. See G. Glenn, 1 Mortgages 3-18, 358-362, 395-
406 (1943); G. Osborne, Mortgages 144 (2d ed. 1970). The
next major change took place in 19th-century America, with
the development of foreclosure by sale (with the surplus over
the debt refunded to the debtor) as a means of avoiding the
draconian consequences of strict foreclosure. Id., at 661-
663; Glenn, supra, at 460-462, 622. Since then, the States
have created diverse networks of judicially and legislatively
crafted rules governing the foreclosure process, to achieve
what each of them considers the proper balance between the

needs of lenders and borrowers. All States permit judicialforeclosure, conducted under direct judicial oversight; about

half of the States also permit foreclosure by exercising a pri-vate power of sale provided in the mortgage documents.
See Zinman, Houle, & Weiss, Fraudulent Transfers Accord-ing to Alden, Gross and Borowitz: A Tale of Two Circuits, 39
Bus. Law. 977, 1004-1005 (1984). Foreclosure laws typicallyrequire notice to the defaulting borrower, a substantial lead
time before the commencement of foreclosure proceedings,publication of a notice of sale, and strict adherence to prescribed bidding rules and auction procedures. Many Statesrequire that the auction be conducted by a government official, and some forbid the property to be sold for less than aspecified fraction of a mandatory presale fair-market-value
appraisal. See id., at 1002, 1004-1005; Osborne, supra, at683, 733-735; G. Osborne, G. Nelson, & D. Whitman, Real
Estate Finance Law 9, 446-447, 475-477 (1979). Whenthese procedures have been followed, however, it is "black
letter" law that mere inadequacy of the foreclosure sale priceis no basis for setting the sale aside, though it may be set
aside (under state foreclosure law, rather than fraudulenttransfer law) if the price is so low as to "shock the conscience
or raise a presumption of fraud or unfairness." Osborne,Nelson, & Whitman,

400 years of peaceful coexistence in Anglo-American juris-prudence until the Fifth Circuit's unprecedented 1980 decision in Durrett. To our knowledge no prior decision hadever applied the "grossly inadequate price" badge of fraud
under fraudulent transfer law to set aside a foreclosure sale.6To say that the "reasonably equivalent value" language in

Opinion of the Court
the fraudulent transfer provision of the Bankruptcy Coderequires a foreclosure sale to yield a certain minimum price

beyond what state foreclosure law requires, is to say, in es-sence, that the Code has adopted Durrett or Bundles.
Surely Congress has the power pursuant to its constitutionalgrant of authority over bankruptcy, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8,
cl. 4, to disrupt the ancient harmony that foreclosure law andfraudulent conveyance law, those two pillars of debtorcreditor jurisprudence, have heretofore enjoyed. But ab-sent clearer textual guidance than the phrase "reasonably
equivalent value"--a phrase entirely compatible with pre-existing practice--we will not presume such a radical departure. See United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of InwoodForest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 380 (1988); Midlantic
Nat. Bank v. New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protec-tion, 474 U. S. 494, 501 (1986); cf. United States v. Texas, 507
U. S. 529, 534 (1993) (statutes that invade common law mustbe read with presumption favoring retention of longestablished principles absent evident statutory purpose tothe contrary).

7 We are unpersuaded by petitioner's argument that the 1984 amendments to the Bankruptcy Code codified the Durrett rule. Those amendments expanded the definition of "transfer" to include "foreclosure of the
debtor's equity of redemption," 11 U. S. C. $ 101(54) (1988 ed., Supp. IV),
and added the words "voluntarily or involuntarily" as modifiers of the
term "transfer" in $ 548(a). The first of these provisions establishes that
foreclosure sales fall within the general definition of "transfers" that may
be avoided under several statutory provisions, including (but not limited
to) $ 548. See $ 522(h) (transfers of exempt property), $ 544 (transfers
voidable under state law), $ 547 (preferential transfers), $ 549 (postpetition
transfers). The second of them establishes that a transfer may be avoided
as fraudulent even if it was against the debtor's will. See In re Madrid,
725 F. 2d 1197, 1199 (CA9 1984) (preamendment decision holding that a
foreclosure sale is not a "transfer" under $ 548). Neither of these consequences has any bearing upon the meaning of "reasonably equivalent
value" in the context of a foreclosure sale.

Nor does our reading render these amendments "superfluous," as the
dissent contends, post, at 555. Prior to 1984, it was at least open to ques511us2$53K 11-03-97 22:06:58 PAGES OPINPGT

it did here by making the provision apply to involuntary as well as voluntary transfers and by including foreclosures within the definition of "transfer." See infra, at 545-546.

States' authority to "defin[e] and adjus[t] the relations between debtors
and creditors . . . [cannot] fairly be called essential to their indepen511us2$53K 11-03-97 22:06:58 PAGES OPINPGT

Code will be construed to adopt, rather than to displace,pre-existing state law. See Kelly, supra, at 49; Butner v.

United States, 440 U. S. 48, 54-55 (1979); Vanston Bondhold-ers Protective Comm. v. Green, 329 U. S. 156, 171 (1946)
(Frankfurter, J., concurring).For the reasons described, we decline to read the phrase
"reasonably equivalent value" in $ 548(a)(2) to mean, in itsapplication to mortgage foreclosure sales, either "fair market
value" or "fair foreclosure price" (whether calculated as apercentage of fair market value or otherwise). We deem, as
the law has always deemed, that a fair and proper price, ora "reasonably equivalent value," for foreclosed property, is
the price in fact received at the foreclosure sale, so long asall the requirements of the State's foreclosure law have been
complied with.This conclusion does not render $ 548(a)(2) superfluous,
since the "reasonably equivalent value" criterion will con-tinue to have independent meaning (ordinarily a meaning
similar to fair market value) outside the foreclosure context.Indeed, $ 548(a)(2) will even continue to be an exclusive
means of invalidating some foreclosure sales. Although collusive foreclosure sales are likely subject to attack under$ 548(a)(1), which authorizes the trustee to avoid transfers

"made . . . with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud"creditors, that provision may not reach foreclosure sales that,
while not intentionally fraudulent, nevertheless fail to com-ply with all governing state laws. Cf. 4 L. King, Collier on
Bankruptcy || 548.02, p. 548-35 (15th ed. 1993) (contrastingsubsections (a)(1) and (a)(2)(A) of $ 548). Any irregularity
in the conduct of the sale that would permit judicial invalida-tion of the sale under applicable state law deprives the sale

dence." Post, at 565, n. 17 (internal quotation marks omitted). This ignores the fact that it is not state authority over debtor-creditor law in
general that is at stake in this case, but the essential sovereign interest
in the security and stability of title to land. See American Land Co. v.
Zeiss, 219 U. S. 47, 60 (1911).

price of its conclusive force under $ 548(a)(2)(A), and thetransfer may be avoided if the price received was not reasonably equivalent to the property's actual value at the time ofthe sale (which we think would be the price that would have
been received if the foreclosure sale had proceeded accordingto law).

III
A few words may be added in general response to the dis-sent. We have no quarrel with the dissent's assertion that

where the "meaning of the Bankruptcy Code's text is itselfclear," post, at 566, its operation is unimpeded by contrary
state law or prior practice. Nor do we contend that Con-gress must override historical state practice "expressly or
not at all." Post, at 565. The Bankruptcy Code can ofcourse override by implication when the implication is unambiguous. But where the intent to override is doubtful, ourfederal system demands deference to long-established traditions of state regulation.The dissent's insistence that here no doubt exists--that
our reading of the statute is "in derogation of the straightforward language used by Congress," post, at 549 (emphasisadded)--does not withstand scrutiny. The problem is not

that we disagree with the dissent's proffered "plain mean-ing" of $ 548(a)(2)(A) ("[T]he bankruptcy court must compare
the price received by the insolvent debtor and the worth ofthe item when sold and set aside the transfer if the former
was substantially (`[un]reasonabl[y]') `less than' the latter,"
post, at 552)--which indeed echoes our own framing of thequestion presented ("whether the amount of debt . . . satisfied at the foreclosure sale . . . is `reasonably equivalent' tothe worth of the real estate conveyed,"

supra, at 536).There is no doubt that this provision directs an inquiry into

the relationship of the value received by the debtor to theworth of the property transferred. The problem, however,
as any "ordinary speaker of English would have no difficultygrasping," post, at 552, is that this highly generalized re511us2$53K 11-03-97 22:06:58 PAGES OPINPGT

547Cite as: 511 U. S. 531 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
formulation of the "plain meaning" of "reasonably equivalentvalue" continues to leave unanswered the one question central to this case, wherein the ambiguity lies: What is a foreclosed property worth? Obviously, until that is determined,
we cannot know whether the value received in exchange for
foreclosed property is "reasonably equivalent." We haveconsidered three (not, as the dissent insists, only two, see

post, at 549) possible answers to this question--fair marketvalue,

supra, at 536-540, reasonable forced-sale price, supra,
at 540, and the foreclosure-sale price itself--and have settledon the last. We would have expected the dissent to opt for

one of the other two, or perhaps even to concoct a fourth;
but one searches Justice Souter's opinion in vain for
any alternative response to the question of the transferred
property's worth. Instead, the dissent simply reiterates
the "single meaning" of "reasonably equivalent value" (with
which we entirely agree): "[A] court should discern the
`value' of the property transferred and determine whether
the price paid was, under the circumstances, `less than reasonabl[e].' " Post, at 559. Well and good. But what is the
"value"? The dissent has no response, evidently thinking
that, in order to establish that the law is clear, it suffices to
show that "the eminent sense of the natural reading," post,
at 565, provides an unanswered question.

Instead of answering the question, the dissent gives us
hope that someone else will answer it, exhorting us "to believe that [bankruptcy courts], familiar with these cases (and
with local conditions) as we are not, will give ["reasonably
equivalent value"] sensible content in evaluating particular
transfers on foreclosure." Post, at 560. While we share
the dissent's confidence in the capabilities of the United
States Bankruptcy Courts, it is the proper function of this
Court to give "sensible content" to the provisions of the
United States Code. It is surely the case that bankruptcy
"courts regularly make . . . determinations about the `reasonably equivalent value' of assets transferred through other

Opinion of the Court
means than foreclosure sales." Post, at 560. But in thevast majority of those cases, they can refer to the traditional

common-law notion of fair market value as the benchmark.As we have demonstrated, this generally useful concept
simply has no application in the foreclosure-sale context,
supra, at 536-540.Although the dissent's conception of what constitutes a

property's "value" is unclear, it does seem to take account ofthe fact that the property is subject to forced sale. The dissent refers, for example, to a reasonable price "under thecircumstances,"

post, at 559, and to the "worth of the item
when sold," post, at 552 (emphasis added). But just as we
are never told how the broader question of a property's
"worth" is to be answered, neither are we informed how the
lesser included inquiry into the impact of forced sale is to be
conducted. Once again, we are called upon to have faith
that bankruptcy courts will be able to determine whether a
property's foreclosure-sale price falls unreasonably short of
its "optimal value," post, at 559, whatever that may be.
This, the dissent tells us, is the statute's plain meaning.

We take issue with the dissent's characterization of our
interpretation as carving out an "exception" for foreclosure
sales, post, at 549, or as giving "two different and inconsistent meanings," post, at 557, to "reasonably equivalent value."
As we have emphasized, the inquiry under $ 548(a)(2)(A)--
whether the debtor has received value that is substantially
comparable to the worth of the transferred property--is the
same for all transfers. But as we have also explained, the
fact that a piece of property is legally subject to forced sale,
like any other fact bearing upon the property's use or alienability, necessarily affects its worth. Unlike most other
legal restrictions, however, foreclosure has the effect of completely redefining the market in which the property is offered for sale; normal free-market rules of exchange are replaced by the far more restrictive rules governing forced
sales. Given this altered reality, and the concomitant inutil511us2$53K 11-03-97 22:06:58 PAGES OPINPGT

ity of the normal tool for determining what property is worth(fair market value), the only legitimate evidence of the property's value at the time it is sold is the foreclosure-saleprice itself.

The Court today holds that by the terms of the Bank-ruptcy Code Congress intended a peppercorn paid at a noncollusive and procedurally regular foreclosure sale to betreated as the "reasonabl[e] equivalent" of the value of a California beachfront estate.

The majority presents our task of giving meaning to$ 548(a)(2)(A) in this case as essentially entailing a choice

between two provisions that Congress might have enacted,but did not. One would allow a bankruptcy trustee to avoid
a recent foreclosure-sale transfer from an insolvent debtorwhenever anything less than fair market value was obtained,
while the second would limit the avoidance power to caseswhere the foreclosure sale was collusive or had failed
to comply with state-prescribed procedures. The Courtthen argues that, given the unexceptionable proposition
that forced sales rarely yield as high a price as sales heldunder ideal, "market" conditions, Congress's "omission" from

an-tithesis" of market value, see ante, at 537, but they fail to

bring in what voluntary sales realize, and rejecting such a

1 I note, however, two preliminary embarrassments: first, the gloss on

$ 548(a)(2)(A) the Court embraces is less than entirely hypothetical. In
the course of amending the Bankruptcy Code in 1984, see infra, at 554,
Congress considered, but did not enact, an amendment that said precisely
what the majority now says the current provision means, i. e., that the
avoidance power is confined to foreclosures involving collusion or procedural irregularity. See S. 445, 98th Cong., 1st Sess., $ 360 (1983). Even
if one is careful not to attach too much significance to such a legislative
nonoccurrence, it surely cautions against undue reliance on a different, entirely speculative congressional "omission." See ante, at 537 (the statute
"seemingly goes out of its way to avoid" using "fair market value"); but cf.
ante, at 545 (reasonably equivalent value will "continue" to have a meaning
"similar to fair market value" outside the foreclosure-sale context).

In this case, such caution would be rewarded. While the assertedly
"standard," ante, at 537, phrase "fair market value" appears in more than
150 distinct provisions of the Tax Code, it figures in only two Bankruptcy
Code provisions, one of which is entitled, suggestively, "Special tax provisions." See 11 U. S. C. $ 346. The term of choice in the bankruptcy setting seems to be "value," unadorned and undefined, which appears in more
than 30 sections of the Bankruptcy Code, but which is, with respect to
many of them, read to mean "fair market value." See also $ 549(c) ("present fair equivalent value"); $ 506(a) ("value [is to] be determined in light
of the purpose of the valuation and of the proposed disposition or use of
such property"); S. Rep. No. 95-989, p. 54 (1978) ("[M]atters [of valuation
under $ 361] are left to case-by-case interpretation and development. . . .
Value [does not] mean, in every case, forced sale liquidation value or full
going concern value. There is wide latitude between those two
extremes . . ."). To the extent, therefore, that this negative implication
supplies ground to "suspect," see ante, at 537, that Congress could not
have meant what the statute says, such suspicion is misplaced.

reading of the statute is as easy as statutory interpretationis likely to get. On the majority's view, laying waste to this

straw man necessitates accepting as adequate value what-ever results from noncollusive adherence to state foreclosure
requirements. Because properties are "simply worth less,"
ante, at 539, on foreclosure sale, the Court posits, they musthave been "worth" whatever price was paid. That, however, is neither a plausible interpretation of the statute, norits only remaining alternative reading.

2 The majority's statutory argument depends similarly heavily on the
success of its effort to relegate "fair market value" to complete pariah
status. But it is no short leap from the (entirely correct) observation that
a property's fair market value will not be dispositive of whether "less than
a reasonably equivalent value" was obtained on foreclosure to the assertion that market value has "no applicability," ante, at 537, or is not "legitimate evidence," ante, at 549 (emphasis added), of whether the statutory
standard was met. As is explored more fully infra, the assessed value of
a parcel of real estate at the time of foreclosure sale is not to be ignored.
On the contrary, that figure plainly is relevant to the Bankruptcy Code
determination, both because it provides a proper measure of the rights
received by the transferee and because it is indicative of the extent of the
debtor's equity in the property, an asset which, but for the prebankruptcy
transfer under review, would have been available to the bankruptcy estate, see infra, at 562-565.

It is also somewhat misleading, similarly, to suggest that "[n]o one would
pay as much," ante, at 539, for a foreclosed property as he would for the
same real estate purchased under leisurely, market conditions. Buyers
no doubt hope for bargains at foreclosure sales, but an investor with a
million dollars cash in his pocket might be ready to pay "as much" for a
desired parcel of property on forced sale, at least if a rival, equally determined millionaire were to appear at the same auction. The principal reason such sales yield low prices is not so much that the properties become
momentarily "worth less," ibid. (on the contrary, foreclosure-sale purchasers receive a bundle of rights essentially similar to what they get when
they buy on the market) or that foreclosing mortgagees are under the
compulsion of state law to make no more than the most desultory efforts
to encourage higher bidding, but rather that such free-spending millionaires are in short supply, and those who do exist are unlikely to read the
fine print which fills the "legal notice" columns of their morning newspaper. Nor, similarly, is market value justly known as the "antithesis" of

The question before the Court is whether the price re-ceived at a foreclosure sale after compliance with state procedural rules in a noncollusive sale must be treated conclu-sively as the "reasonably equivalent value" of the mortaged
property and in answering that question, the words andmeaning of $ 548(a)(2)(A) are plain. See

Patterson v. Shu-mate, 504 U. S. 753, 760 (1992) (party seeking to defeat plain

meaning of Bankruptcy Code text bears an "exceptionallyheavy burden") (internal quotation marks omitted); Perrin
v. United States, 444 U. S. 37, 42 (1979) (statutory wordsshould be given their ordinary meaning). A trustee is authorized to avoid certain recent prebankruptcy transfers,including those on foreclosure sales, that a bankruptcy court
determines were not made in exchange for "a reasonablyequivalent value." Although this formulation makes no pretense to mathematical precision, an ordinary speaker of Eng-lish would have no difficulty grasping its basic thrust: the
bankruptcy court must compare the price received by theinsolvent debtor and the worth of the item when sold and
set aside the transfer if the former was substantially ("[un]-reasonabl[y]") "less than" the latter.

3 Nor would any ordinary English speaker, concerned to determine whether aforeclosure sale was collusive or procedurally irregular (an

enquiry going exclusively to the process by which a transac-tion was consummated), direct an adjudicator, as the Court
now holds Congress did, to ascertain whether the sale hadrealized "less than a reasonably equivalent value" (an enquiry described in quintessentially substantive terms).4
foreclosure-sale price, for the important (if intuitive) reason that properties with higher market values can be expected to sell for more on
foreclosure.

3 Indeed, it is striking that this is what the Court says the statute (probably) does mean, with respect to almost every transfer other than a sale
of property upon foreclosure. See ante, at 545.

deviates only subtly from the reading advanced here and purports not to
disagree that the statute compels an enquiry "into the relationship of the

Closer familiarity with the text, structure, and history ofthe disputed provision (and relevant amendments) confirms

the soundness of the plain reading. Before 1984, the ques-tion whether foreclosure sales fell within bankruptcy courts'
power to set aside transfers for "too little in return" was,potentially, a difficult one. Then, it might plausibly have
been contended that $ 548 was most concerned with "fraudu-lent" conduct by debtors on the brink of bankruptcy, misbehavior unlikely to be afoot when an insolvent debtor's prop-erty is sold, against his wishes, at foreclosure.

5 Indeed, it

could further have been argued, again consonantly with thetext of the earlier version of the Bankruptcy Code, that Congress had not understood foreclosure to involve a "transfer"within the ambit of $ 548, see,

e. g., Abramson v. LakewoodBank & Trust Co., 647 F. 2d 547, 549 (CA5 1981) (Clark, J.,

value received and the worth of the property transferred," ante, at 546.
Reassuring as such carefully chosen words may sound, they cannot obscure the fact that the "comparison" the majority envisions is an empty
ritual. See n. 10, infra.

5 The Court notes correctly that fraudulent conveyance laws were directed first against insolvent debtors' passing assets to friends or relatives, in order to keep them beyond their creditors' reach (the proverbial
"Elizabethan deadbeat who sells his sheep to his brother for a pittance,"
see Baird & Jackson, Fraudulent Conveyance Law and Its Proper Domain,
38 Vand. L. Rev. 829, 852 (1985)), and then later against conduct said to
carry the "badges" of such misconduct, but bankruptcy law had, well before 1984, turned decisively away from the notion that the debtor's state
of mind, and not the objective effects on creditors, should determine the
scope of the avoidance power. Thus, the 1938 Chandler Act, Bankruptcy
Revision, provided that a transfer could be set aside without proving any
intent to "hinder, delay, or defraud," provided that the insolvent debtor
obtained less than "fair consideration" in return, see 11 U. S. C. $ 107(d)(2)
(1976), and the 1978 Bankruptcy Code eliminated scrutiny of the transacting parties' "good faith." Cf. 11 U. S. C. $ 107(d)(1)(e) (1976). At the time
when bankruptcy law was more narrowly concerned with debtors' turpitude, moreover, the available "remedies" were strikingly different, as well.
See, e. g., 21 Jac. I., ch. 19, $ 6 (1623), 4 Statutes of the Realm 1228 (insolvent debtor who fraudulently conceals assets is subject to have his ear
nailed to pillory and cut off).

dissenting) (Bankruptcy Act case), cert. denied, 454 U. S.
1164 (1982), on the theory that the "transfer" from mortgagor to mortgagee occurs, once and for all, when the security interest is first created. See generally In re Madrid,
725 F. 2d 1197 (CA9), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 833 (1984).

In 1984, however, Congress pulled the rug out from under
these previously serious arguments, by amending the Code
in two relevant respects. See Bankruptcy Amendments and
Federal Judgeship Act of 1984, $$ 401(1), 463(a), 98 Stat. 366,
378. One amendment provided expressly that "involuntar[y]" transfers are no less within the trustee's $ 548 avoidance powers than "voluntar[y]" ones, and another provided
that the "foreclosure of the debtor's equity of redemption"
itself is a "transfer" for purposes of bankruptcy law. See 11
U. S. C. $ 101(54) (1988 ed., Supp. IV).6 Thus, whether or not
one believes (as the majority seemingly does not) that foreclosure sales rightfully belong within the historic domain of
"fraudulent conveyance" law, that is exactly where Congress
has now put them, cf. In re Ehring, 900 F. 2d 184, 187 (CA9
1990), and our duty is to give effect to these new amendments, along with every other clause of the Bankruptcy
Code. See, e. g., United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503
U. S. 30, 36 (1992); United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers
of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 374-375

or other security agreement takes for reasonably equivalent value

the legislation enacted by Congress.

plain effect of $ 548(a)(2)(A) opens it to some equally plainobjections.

The first and most obvious of these objections is the veryenigma of the Court's reading. If a property's "value" is
conclusively presumed to be whatever it sold for, the "less
than reasonabl[e] equivalen[ce]" question will never be worthasking, and the bankruptcy avoidance power will apparently

be a dead letter in reviewing real estate foreclosures. Cf.11 U. S. C. $ 361(3) ("indubitable equivalent").

7 The Court

answers that the section is not totally moribund: it still fur-nishes a way to attack collusive or procedurally deficient real

property foreclosures, and it enjoys a vital role in authoriz-ing challenges to other transfers than those occurring on real
estate foreclosure. The first answer, however, just runs upagainst a new objection. If indeed the statute fails to reach
noncollusive, procedurally correct real estate foreclosures,
then the recent amendments discussed above were probablysuperfluous. There is a persuasive case that collusive or seriously irregular real estate sales were already subject toavoidance in bankruptcy, see,

e. g., In re Worcester, 811 F. 2d
1224, 1228, 1232 (CA9 1987) (interpreting $ 541(a)), and nei-ther the Court nor the respondents and their

amici identify
any specific case in which a court pronounced itself powerlessto avoid a collusive foreclosure sale. But cf.

Madrid, supra,
at 1204 (Farris, J., concurring). It would seem peculiar,

7 Evidently, many States take a less Panglossian view than does the
majority about the prices paid at sales conducted in accordance with their
prescribed procedures. If foreclosure-sale prices truly represented what
properties are "worth," ante, at 539, or their "fair and proper price," ante,
at 545, it would stand to reason that deficiency judgments would be
awarded simply by calculating the difference between the debt owed and
the "value," as established by the sale. Instead, in those jurisdictions
permitting creditors to seek deficiency judgments it is quite common to
require them to show that the foreclosure price roughly approximated the
property's (appraised) value. See, e. g., Tex. Prop. Code Ann. $$ 51.003-
51.005 (Supp. 1992); see generally Gelfert v. National City Bank of N. Y.,
313 U. S. 221 (1941); cf. id., at 233 ("[T]he price which property commands
at a forced sale may be hardly even a rough measure of its value").

then, that for no sound reason, Congress would have tin-kered with these closely watched sections of the Bankruptcy

Code, for the sole purpose of endowing bankruptcy courtswith authority that had not been found wanting in the first
place.8The Court's second answer to the objection that it renders
the statute a dead letter is to remind us that the statuteapplies to all sorts of transfers, not just to real estate foreclosures, and as to all the others, the provision enjoys greatvitality, calling for true comparison between value received
for the property and its "reasonably equivalent value." (In-deed, the Court has no trouble acknowledging that something "similar to" fair market value may supply the bench-mark of reasonable equivalence when such a sale is not
initiated by a mortgagee, ante, at 545.) This answer, how-ever, is less tenable than the first. A common rule of con8 That is not the only aspect of the majority's approach that is hard to
square with the amended text. By redefining "transfer" in $ 101, Congress authorized the trustee to avoid any "foreclosure of the equity of
redemption" for "less than a reasonably equivalent value." In light of the
fact, see, e. g., Lifton, Real Estate in Trouble: Lender's Remedies Need an
Overhaul, 31 Bus. Law 1927, 1937 (1976), that most foreclosure properties
are sold (at noncollusive and procedurally unassailable sales, we may presume) for the precise amount of the outstanding indebtedness, when some
(but by no means all) are worth more, see generally Wechsler, Through
the Looking Glass: Foreclosure by Sale as De Facto Strict Foreclosure--
An Empirical Study of Mortgage Foreclosure and Subsequent Resale, 70
Cornell L. Rev. 850 (1985), it seems particularly curious that Congress
would amend a statute to recognize that a debtor "transfers" an "interest
in property," when the equity of redemption is foreclosed, fully intending
that the "reasonably equivalent value" of that interest would, in the majority of cases, be presumed conclusively to be zero.

To the extent that the Court believes the amended $ 548(a)(2)(A) to be
addressed to "collusive" sales, meanwhile, a surprisingly indirect means
was chosen. Cf. 11 U. S. C. $ 363(n) (authorizing trustee avoidance of postpetition sale, or, in the alternative, recovery of the difference between the
"value" of the property and the "sale price," when the "sale price was
controlled by an agreement"). Cf. ante, at 537 (citing Chicago v. Environmental Defense Fund, ante, at 338).

struction calls for a single definition of a common termoccurring in several places within a statute, see Bray

v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, 506 U. S. 263, 283(1993); Dewsnup v. Timm, 502 U. S., at 422 (

Scalia, J., dis-senting) (" `[N]ormal rule[s] of statutory construction' " require that "identical words [used] in the same section of thesame enactment" must be given the same effect) (emphasis
in original), and the case for different definitions within asingle text is difficult to make, cf. Bray, supra, at 292 (

Souter, J., concurring in part). But to give a single term twodifferent and inconsistent meanings (one procedural, one substantive) for a single occurrence is an offense so unlikely thatno common prohibition has ever been thought necessary to
guard against it.9 Cf. Owen v. Owen, 500 U. S. 305, 313(1991) (declining to "create a distinction [between state and
federal exemptions] that the words of the statute do not contain"); Union Bank v. Wolas, 502 U. S. 151, 162 (1991) (the"statutory text . . . makes no distinction between short-term

debt and long-term debt"). Unless whimsy is attributed toCongress, the term in question cannot be exclusively procedural in one class of cases and entirely substantive in allothers. To be sure, there are real differences between sales
on mortgage foreclosures and other transfers, as Congressno doubt understood, but these differences may be addressed
simply and consistently with the statute's plain meaning.10

9 Indeed, the Court candidly acknowledges that the proliferation of
meanings may not stop at two: not only does "reasonably equivalent value"
mean one thing for foreclosure sales and another for other transfers, but
tax sales and other transactions may require still other, unspecified
"benchmark[s]." See ante, at 537, and n. 3.

10 The Court's somewhat mischievous efforts to dress its narrowly procedural gloss in respectable, substantive garb, see ante, at 537-538, 546-547,
make little sense. The majority suggests that even if the statute must be
read to require a comparison, the one it compels dooms the trustee always
to come up short. A property's "value," the Court would have us believe,
should be determined with reference to a State's rules governing creditors' enforcement of their rights, in the same fashion that it might encom511us2$53M 11-03-97 22:06:58 PAGES OPINPGT

The "neologism," ante, at 537, "reasonably equivalentvalue" (read in light of the amendments confirming that foreclosures are to be judged under the same standard as are
pass a zoning rule governing (as a matter of state law) a neighboring
landowner's entitlement to build a gas station. But the analogy proposed
ignores the patent difference between these two aspects of the "regulatory
background," ante, at 539: while the zoning ordinance would reduce the
value of the property "to the world," foreclosure rules affect not the price
any purchaser "would pay," ibid., but rather the means by which the mortgagee is permitted to extract its entitlement from the entire "value" of
the property.

Such distinctions are a mainstay of bankruptcy law, where it is commonly said that creditors' "substantive" state-law rights "survive" in
bankruptcy, while their "procedural" or "remedial" rights under state
debtor-creditor law give way, see, e. g., United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 370-371 (1988) (refusing to treat "right to immediate foreclosure" as an "interest in property" under applicable nonbankruptcy law); Owen v. Owen, 500 U. S. 305
(1991) (bankruptcy exemption does not incorporate state law with respect
to liens); United States v. Whiting Pools, Inc., 462 U. S. 198, 206-207
(1983); see also Gelfert v. National City Bank of N. Y., 313 U. S., at 234
("[T]he advantages of a forced sale" are not "a . . . property right" under
the Constitution). And while state foreclosure rules reflect, inter alia,
an understandable judgment that creditors should not be forced to wait
indefinitely as their defaulting debtors waste the value of loan collateral,
bankruptcy law affords mortgagees distinct and presumably adequate
protections for their interest, see 11 U. S. C. $$ 548(c), 550(d)(1), 362(d);
Wright v. Union Central Life Ins. Co., 311 U. S. 273, 278-279 (1940), along
with the general promise that the debtor's estate will, effectively, be maximized in the interest of creditors.

The majority professes to be "baffled," ante, at 539, n. 5, by this commonsense distinction between state zoning laws and state foreclosure procedures. But a zoning rule is not merely "price-affecting," ante, at 539:
it affects the property's value (i. e., the price for which any transferee can
expect to resell). State-mandated foreclosure procedures, by contrast,
might be called "price-affecting," in the sense that adherence solely to
their minimal requirements will no doubt keep sale prices low. But state
rules hardly forbid mortgagees to make efforts to encourage more robust
bidding at foreclosure sales; they simply fail to furnish sellers any reason
to do so, see infra.

other transfers) has a single meaning in the one provision
in which it figures: a court should discern the "value" of
the property transferred and determine whether the price
paid was, under the circumstances, "less than reasonabl[e]."
There is thus no reason to rebuke the Courts of Appeals
for having failed to "come to grips," ante, at 538, with the
implications of the fact that foreclosure sales cannot be expected to yield fair market value. The statute has done so
for them. As courts considering nonforeclosure transfers
often acknowledge, the qualification "reasonably equivalent"
itself embodies both an awareness that the assets of insolvent debtors are commonly transferred under conditions that
will yield less than their optimal value and a judgment that
avoidance in bankruptcy (unsettling as it does the expectations of parties who may have dealt with the debtor in
good faith) should only occur when it is clear that the
bankruptcy estate will be substantially augmented. See,
e. g., In re Southmark Corp., 138 B. R. 820, 829-830
(Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Tex. 1992) (court must compare "the value
of what went out with the value of what came in," but
the equivalence need not be "dollar for dollar") (citation
omitted); In re Countdown of Conn., Inc., 115 B. R. 18, 21
(Bkrtcy. Ct. Conn. 1990) ("[S]ome disparity between the
value of the collateral and the value of debt does not necessarily lead to a finding of lack of reasonably equivalent
value").11

11 Indeed, it is not clear from its opinion that the Court has "come to
grips," ante, at 538, with the reality that "involuntary" transfers occur
outside the real property setting, that legally voluntary transfers can be
involuntary in fact, and that, where insolvent debtors on the threshold of
bankruptcy are concerned, transfers for full, "fair market" price are more
likely the exception than the rule. On the Court's reading, for example,
nothing would prevent a debtor who deeded property to a mortgagee "in
lieu of foreclosure" prior to bankruptcy from having the transaction set
aside, under the "ordinar[y]," ante, at 545, substantive standard.

I do not share in my colleagues' apparently extreme dis-comfort at the prospect of vesting bankruptcy courts with

responsibility for determining whether "reasonably equiva-lent value" was received in cases like this one, nor is the
suggestion well taken that doing so is an improper abdica-tion. Those courts regularly make comparably difficult (and
contestable) determinations about the "reasonably equiva-lent value" of assets transferred through other means than
foreclosure sales, see, e. g., Covey v. Commercial Nat. Bank,960 F. 2d 657, 661-662 (CA7 1992) (rejecting creditor's claim

transfer was "unreasonabl[y]" low, and as in other casesunder the provision, the gravamen of such a claim will be
that the challenged transfer significantly and needlessly di-minished the bankruptcy estate,

13 In this regard and in its professions of deference to the processes of

local self-government, the Court wrongly elides any distinction between
what state law commands and what the States permit. While foreclosure
sales "under state law" may typically be sparsely attended and yield low
prices, see infra, at 564, these are perhaps less the result of state law
"strictures," ante, at 538, than of what state law fails to supply, incentives
for foreclosing lenders to seek higher prices (by availing themselves of
advertising or brokerage services, for example). Thus, in judging the
reasonableness of an apparently low price, it will surely make sense to
take into account (as the Court holds a bankruptcy court is forbidden to)
whether a mortgagee who promptly resold the property at a large profit
answers, "I did the most that could be expected of me" or "I did the least
I was allowed to."

I also do not join my colleagues in their special scorn for the "70% rule"
associated with Durrett v. Washington Nat. Ins. Co., 621 F. 2d 201 (CA5
1980), which they decry, ante, at 540, as less an exercise in statutory interpretation than one of "policy determinatio[n]." Such, of course, it may be,
in the limited sense that the statute's text no more mentions the 70%
figure than it singles out procedurally regular foreclosure sales for the
special treatment the Court accords them. But the Durrett "rule," as its
expositor has long made clear, claims only to be a description of what
foreclosure prices have, in practice, been found "reasonabl[e]," and as such,
it is consistent (as the majority's "policy determination" is not), with the
textual directive that one value be compared to another, the transfer being
set aside when one is unreasonably "less than" the other. To the extent,
moreover, that Durrett is said to have announced a "rule," it is better

Whether that enquiry is described as a search for a bench-mark " `fair' forced-sale price," ante, at 540, or for the price

that was reasonable under the circumstances, cf. ante, at 538,n. 4, is ultimately, as the Court itself seems to acknowledge,
see ante, at 540, of no greater moment than whether the rulethe Court discerns in the provision is styled an "exception,"
an "irrebuttable presumption," or a rule of per se validity.The majority seems to invoke these largely synonymous
terms in service of its thesis that the provision's text is"ambiguous" (and therefore ripe for application of policybased construction rules), but the question presented here,whether the term "less than reasonably equivalent value"
may be read to forestall all enquiry beyond whether state-law foreclosure procedures were adhered to, admits only
two answers, and only one of these, in the negative, is withinthe "apparent authority," ibid., conferred on courts by the
text of the Bankruptcy Code.14

What plain meaning requires and courts can provide, in-deed, the policies underlying a national bankruptcy law fully

understood as recognizing a "safe harbor" or affirmative defense for bidding mortgagees or other transferees who paid 70% or more of a property's appraised value at the time of sale.

14 The Court's criticism, ante, at 546-548, deftly conflates two distinct

questions: is the price on procedurally correct and noncollusive sale presumed irrebuttably to be reasonably equivalent value (the question before
us) and, if not, what are the criteria (a question not raised here but explored by courts that have rejected the irrebuttable presumption)? What
is "plain" is the answer to the first question, thanks to the plain language,
whose meaning is confirmed by policy and statutory history. The answer
to the second may not be plain in the sense that the criteria might be
self-evident, see n. 13, supra, but want of self-evidence hardly justifies
retreat from the obvious answer to the first question. Courts routinely
derive criteria, unexpressed in a statute, to implement standards that are
statutorily expressed, and in a proper case this Court could (but for the
majority's decision) weigh the relative merits of the subtly different approaches taken by courts that have rejected the irrebuttable presumption.

support. This case is a far cry from the rare one where theeffect of implementing the ordinary meaning of the statutory

text would be "patent absurdity," see INS v. CardozaFonseca, 480 U. S. 421, 452 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring in
judgment), or "demonstrably at odds with the intentions of
its drafters," United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc.,489 U. S. 235, 244 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Permitting avoidance of procedurally regular foreclosuresales for low prices (and thereby returning a valuable asset

to the bankruptcy estate) is plainly consistent with those pol-icies of obtaining a maximum and equitable distribution for
creditors and ensuring a "fresh start" for individual debtors,which the Court has often said are at the core of federal
bankruptcy law. See Stellwagen v. Clum, 245 U. S. 605, 617(1918);

Williams v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co.,
236 U. S. 549, 554-555 (1915). They are not, of course, any
less the policies of federal bankruptcy law simply because
state courts will not, for a mortgagor's benefit, set aside a
foreclosure sale for "price inadequacy" alone.16 The unwill15 Tellingly, while the Court's opinion celebrates fraudulent conveyance
law and state foreclosure law as the "twin pillars" of creditor-debtor regulation, it evinces no special appreciation of the fact that this case arises
under the Bankruptcy Code, which, in maintaining the national system of
credit and commerce, embodies policies distinct from those of state
debtor-creditor law, see generally Stellwagen v. Clum, 245 U. S. 605, 617
(1918), and which accordingly endows trustees with avoidance power beyond what state law provides, see Board of Trade of Chicago v. Johnson,
264 U. S. 1, 10 (1924); Stellwagen, supra, at 617; 11 U. S. C. $$ 541(a), 544(a).

16 Although the majority accurately states this " `black letter' " law, it

also acknowledges that courts will avoid a foreclosure sale for a price that
"shock[s] the conscience," see ante, at 542 (internal quotation marks omitted), a standard that has been invoked to justify setting aside sales yielding as much as 87% of appraised value. See generally Washburn, The
Judicial and Legislative Response to Price Inadequacy in Mortgage Foreclosure Sales, 53 S. Cal. L. Rev. 843, 862-870 (1980). Moreover, while
price inadequacy "alone" may not be enough to set aside a sale, such inadequacy will often induce a court to undertake a sort of "strict scrutiny" of
a sale's compliance with state procedures. See, e. g., id., at 861.

ingness of the state courts to upset a foreclosure sale for thatreason does not address the question of what "reasonably

equivalent value" means in bankruptcy law, any more thanthe refusal of those same courts to set aside a contract for
"mere inadequacy of consideration," see Restatement (Second) of Contracts $ 79 (1981), would define the scope ofthe trustee's power to reject executory contracts. See 11

U. S. C. $ 365 (1988 ed. and Supp. IV). On the contrary, acentral premise of the bankruptcy avoidance powers is that
what state law plainly allows as acceptable or "fair," as be-tween a debtor and a particular creditor, may be set aside
because of its impact on other creditors or on the debtor's
chances for a fresh start.

When the prospect of such avoidance is absent, indeed, the
economic interests of a foreclosing mortgagee often stand in
stark opposition to those of the debtor himself and of his
other creditors. At a typical foreclosure sale, a mortgagee
has no incentive to bid any more than the amount of the
indebtedness, since any "surplus" would be turned over to
the debtor (or junior lienholder), and, in some States, it can
even be advantageous for the creditor to bid less and seek a
deficiency judgment. See generally Washburn, The Judicial
and Legislative Response to Price Inadequacy in Mortgage
Foreclosure Sales, 53 S. Cal. L. Rev. 843, 847-851 (1980); Ehrlich, Avoidance of Foreclosure Sales as Fraudulent Conveyances: Accommodating State and Federal Objectives, 71
Va. L. Rev. 933, 959-962 (1985); G. Osborne, G. Nelson, &
D. Whitman, Real Estate Finance Law $ 8.3, p. 528 (1979).
And where a property is obviously worth more than the
amount of the indebtedness, the lending mortgagee's interests are served best if the foreclosure sale is poorly attended;
then, the lender is more likely to take the property by bidding the amount of indebtedness, retaining for itself any
profits from resale. While state foreclosure procedures may
somewhat mitigate the potential for this sort of opportunism
(by requiring for publication of notice, for example), it surely

is plausible that Congress, in drafting the Bankruptcy Code,would find it intolerable that a debtor's assets be wasted and

the bankruptcy estate diminished, solely to speed a mortga-gee's recovery.

II
Confronted with the eminent sense of the natural reading,the Court seeks finally to place this case in a line of decisions,

e. g., Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452 (1991), in which wehave held that something more than mere plain language is
required.17 Because the stability of title in real propertymay be said to be an "important" state interest, the Court
suggests, see ante, at 544, the statute must be presumed tocontain an implicit foreclosure-sale exception, which Congress must override expressly or not at all. Our cases im-pose no such burden on Congress, however. To be sure,
they do offer support for the proposition that when the Bank-ruptcy Code is truly silent or ambiguous, it should not be

17 The Court dangles the possibility that Gregory itself is somehow pertinent to this case, but that cannot be so. There, invoking principles of
constitutional avoidance, we recognized a "plain statement" rule, whereby
Congress could supplant state powers "reserved under the Tenth Amendment" and "at the heart of representative government," only by making
its intent to do so unmistakably clear. Unlike the States' authority to
"determine the qualifications of their most important government officials," 501 U. S., at 463 (e. g., to enforce a retirement age for state judges
mandated by the State Constitution, at issue in Gregory), the authority of
the States in defining and adjusting the relations between debtors and
creditors has never been plenary, nor could it fairly be called "essential to
their independence." In making the improbable contrary assertion, the
Court converts a stray phrase in American Land Co. v. Zeiss, 219 U. S. 47
(1911), which upheld against substantive due process challenge the power
of a State to legislate with respect to land titles (California's effort to
restore order after title records had been destroyed in the calamitous 1906
San Francisco earthquake) into a pronouncement about the allocation of
responsibility between the National Government and the States. Cf. Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 546 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (emphasizing the inapplicability of "clear-statement" rules to ordinary pre-emption cases).

read as departing from previous practice, see, e. g., Dewsnup
v. Timm, 502 U. S. 410 (1992); Butner v. United States, 440
U. S. 48, 54 (1979). But we have never required Congress
to supply "clearer textual guidance" when the apparent
meaning of the Bankruptcy Code's text is itself clear, as it is
here. See Ron Pair, 489 U. S., at 240 ("[I]t is not appropriate or realistic to expect Congress to have explained with
particularity each step it took. Rather, as long as the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent, there generally is no
need for a court to inquire beyond the plain language of the
statute"); cf. Dewsnup, supra, at 434 (Scalia, J., dissenting)
(Court should not "venerat[e] `pre-Code law' " at the expense
of plain statutory meaning).18

We have, on many prior occasions, refused to depart from
plain Code meaning in spite of arguments that doing that
would vindicate similar, and presumably equally "important," state interests. In Owen v. Owen, 500 U. S. 305
(1991), for example, the Court refused to hold that the state
"opt-out" policy embodied in $ 522(b)(1) required immunity
from avoidance under $ 522(f ) for a lien binding under Florida's exemption rules. We emphasized that "[n]othing in the
text of $ 522(f ) remotely justifies treating the [state and federal] exemptions differently." 500 U. S., at 313. And in
Johnson v. Home State Bank, 501 U. S. 78 (1991), we relied
on plain Code language to allow a debtor who had "stripped"
himself of personal mortgage liability under Chapter 7 to
reschedule the remaining indebtedness under Chapter 13,
notwithstanding a plausible contrary argument based on
Code structure and a complete dearth of precedent for the
manoeuver under state law and prior bankruptcy practice.

18 Even if plain language is insufficiently "clear guidance" for the Court,
further guidance is at hand here. The provision at hand was amended in
the face of judicial decisions driven by the same policy concerns that animate the Court, to make plain that foreclosure sales and other "involuntary" transfers are within the sweep of the avoidance power.

The Court has indeed given full effect to Bankruptcy Codeterms even in cases where the Code would appear to have

cut closer to the heart of state power than it does here. No"clearer textual guidance" than a general definitional provision was required, for example, to hold that criminal restitution could be a "debt" dischargeable under Chapter 13, see
Davenport, 495 U. S., at 563-564 (declining to "carve out a
broad judicial exception" from statutory term, even to avoid"hamper[ing] the flexibility of state criminal judges"). Nor,

in Perez v. Campbell, 402 U. S. 637 (1971), did we require anexpress reference to state highway safety laws before construing the generally worded discharge provision of theBankruptcy Act to bar application of a state statute suspending the driver's licenses of uninsured tortfeasors.19Rather than allow state practice to trump the plain meaning of federal statutes, cf. Adams Fruit Co. v. Barrett, 494U. S. 638, 648 (1990), our cases describe a contrary rule:
whether or not Congress has used any special "pre-emptive"
language, state regulation must yield to the extent it actually conflicts with federal law. This is no less true of laws
enacted under Congress's power to "establish . . . uniform
Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies," U. S. Const., Art. I,

$ 8, cl. 4, than of those passed under its Commerce Clause
power. See generally Perez v. Campbell, supra; cf. id., at

19 Only over vigorous dissent did the Court read the trustee's generally
worded abandonment power, 11 U. S. C. $ 554, as not authorizing abandonment "in contravention of a state statute or regulation that is reasonably
designed to protect the public health or safety from identified hazards."
Midlantic Nat. Bank v. New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protection,
474 U. S. 494, 505 (1986); cf. id., at 513 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) ("Congress knew how to draft an exception covering the exercise of `certain'
police powers when it wanted to"); cf. also L. Cherkis & L. King, Collier
Real Estate Transactions and the Bankruptcy Code, p. 6-24 (1992) (postMidlantic cases suggest that "if the hazardous substances on the property
do not pose immediate danger to the public, and if the trustee has
promptly notified local environmental authorities of the contamination and
cooperated with them, abandonment may be permitted").

651-652 (rejecting the "aberrational doctrine . . . that statelaw may frustrate the operation of federal law as long as the

state legislature in passing its law had some purpose in mindother than one of frustration"); Cipollone v. Liggett Group,
Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 545, 546 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring injudgment in part and dissenting in part) (arguing against
a "presumption against . . . pre-emption" of "historic policepowers") (internal quotation marks omitted).

Nor, finally, is it appropriate for the Court to look to "fieldpre-emption" cases, see

ante, at 544, to support the higherduty of clarity it seeks to impose on Congress. As written

and as applied by the majority of Courts of Appeals to con-strue it, the disputed Code provision comes nowhere near
working the fundamental displacement of the state law offoreclosure procedure that the majority's rhetoric conjures.

20

20 Talk of " `radica[l] adjust[ments to] the balance of state and national
authority,' " ante, at 544, notwithstanding, the Court's submission with respect to "displacement" consists solely of the fact that some private companies in Durrett jurisdictions have required purchasers of title insurance to
accept policies with "specially crafted exceptions from coverage in many
policies issued for properties purchased at foreclosure sales." Ante, at
544 (citing Cherkis & King, supra, at 5-18 to 5-19). The source cited
by the Court reports that these exceptions have been demanded when
mortgagees are the purchasers, but have not been required in policies
issued to third-party purchasers or their transferees, Cherkis & King,
supra, at 5-18 to 5-19, and that such clauses have neither been limited to
Durrett jurisdictions, nor confined to avoidance under federal bankruptcy
law. See Cherkis & King, supra, at 5-10 (noting one standard exclusion
from coverage for "[a]ny claim, which arises . . . by reason of the operation
of federal bankruptcy, state insolvency, or similar creditors' rights laws").
Nothing in the Bankruptcy Code, moreover, deprives the States of their
broad powers to regulate directly the terms and conditions of title insurance policies.

The "federally created cloud" on title seems hardly to be the Damoclean
specter that the Court makes it out to be. In the nearly 14 years since
the Durrett decision, the bankruptcy reports have included a relative

handful of decisions actually setting aside foreclosure sales, nor do the
States, either inside or outside Durrett jurisdictions, seem to have ven511us2$53M 11-03-97 22:06:58 PAGES OPINPGT

To the contrary, construing $ 548(a)(2)(A) as authorizingavoidance of an insolvent's recent foreclosure-sale transfer

in which "less than a reasonably equivalent value" wasobtained is no more pre-emptive of state foreclosure procedures than the trustee's power to set aside transfers by mari-tal dissolution decree, see

Britt v. Damson, 334 F. 2d 896(CA9 1964), cert. denied, 379 U. S. 966 (1965); In re Lange,

35 B. R. 579 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Mo. 1983), "pre-empts" statedomestic relations law,

21 or the power to reject executory

contracts, see 11 U. S. C. $ 365, "displaces" the state law ofvoluntary obligation. While it is surely true that if the provision were accorded its plain meaning, some States (andmany mortgagees) would take steps to diminish the risk that
particular transactions would be set aside, such voluntaryaction should not be cause for dismay: it would advance core
Bankruptcy Code purposes of augmenting the bankruptcyestate and improving the debtor's prospects for a "fresh
start," without compromising lenders' state-law rights tomove expeditiously against the property for the money
owed. To the extent, in any event, that the respondents andtheir numerous

amici are correct that the "important" policyfavoring security of title should count more and the "important" bankruptcy policies should count less, Congress,and not this Court, is the appropriate body to provide
a foreclosure-sale exception. See Wolas, 502 U. S., at 162.See also S. 1358, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. (1987) (proposed
amendment creating foreclosure-sale exception).

III
Like the Court, I understand this case to involve a choicebetween two possible statutory provisions: one authorizing

tured major changes in the "diverse networks of . . . rules governing the
foreclosure process." See ante, at 541.

21 But cf. Wetmore v. Markoe, 196 U. S. 68 (1904) (alimony is not a "debt"

subject to discharge under the Bankruptcy Act).

NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD v. HEALTHCARE & RETIREMENT CORPORATION OF

AMERICA
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 92-1964. Argued February 22, 1994--Decided May 23, 1994
Employees are considered "supervisors," and thus are not covered under

the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U. S. C. $ 152(3), if they have authority, requiring the use of independent judgment, to engage in one of
12 listed activities and they hold the authority "in the interest of the
employer," $ 152(11). Petitioner National Labor Relations Board has
stated that a nurse's supervisory activity incidental to the treatment
of patients is not authority exercised in the interest of the employer.
Respondent owns and operates a nursing home at which staff nurses--
including the four nurses involved in this case--are the senior ranking
employees on duty most of the time, ensure adequate staffing, make
daily work assignments, monitor and evaluate the work of nurses' aides,
and report to management. In finding that respondent had committed
an unfair labor practice in disciplining the four nurses, an Administrative Law Judge concluded that the nurses were not supervisors because
their focus was on the well-being of the residents, not the employer.
The Board affirmed, but the Court of Appeals reversed, deciding that
the Board's test for determining nurses' supervisory status was inconsistent with the statute.

Held: The Board's test for determining whether nurses are supervisors is

inconsistent with the statute. Pp. 576-584.

(a) The Board has created a false dichotomy--between acts taken in
connection with patient care and acts taken in the interest of the employer. Cf. NLRB v. Yeshiva Univ., 444 U. S. 672, 688. Since patient
care is a nursing home's business, it follows that attending to the needs
of patients, who are the employer's customers, is in the employer's interest. This conclusion is supported by the Court's decision in Packard
Motor Car Co. v. NLRB, 330 U. S. 485, 488-489, interpreting the phrase
"in the interest of an employer." Pp. 576-580.

(b) The Board's nonstatutory arguments supporting its interpretation
are unpersuasive. Its contention that granting organizational rights to
nurses whose supervisory authority concerns patient care does not
threaten the conflicting loyalties that the supervisor exception was designed to avoid is rejected. The Act must be enforced according to its

own terms, not by creating legal categories inconsistent with its meaning. Nor can the tension between the Act's exclusion of supervisory
and managerial employees and its inclusion of professionals be resolved
by distorting the statutory language in the manner proposed by the
Board. In addition, an isolated statement in the legislative history of
the 1974 amendments to the Act--expressing apparent approval of the
application of the Board's then-current supervisory test to nurses--does
not represent an authoritative interpretation of the phrase "in the interest of the employer" enacted by Congress in 1947. Pp. 580-582.

Opinion of the Court
those rights to supervisory employees, however, so the statu-tory definition of supervisor becomes essential in determining which employees are covered by the Act. In this case,we decide the narrow question whether the National Labor
Relations Board's (Board's) test for determining if a nurse isa supervisor is consistent with the statutory definition.

I
Congress enacted the National Labor Relations Act in1935. Act of July 5, 1935, ch. 372, 49 Stat. 449. In the early

years of its operation, the Act did not exempt supervisoryemployees from its coverage; as a result, supervisory employees could organize as part of bargaining units and negoti-ate with the employer. Employers complained that this
produced an imbalance between labor and management, butin 1947 this Court refused to carve out a supervisory employee exception from the Act's broad coverage. The Courtstated that "it is for Congress, not for us, to create exceptions or qualifications at odds with [the Act's] plain terms."
Packard Motor Car Co. v. NLRB, 330 U. S. 485, 490 (1947).Later that year, Congress did just that, amending the statute

so that the term " `employee' . . . shall not include . . . anyindividual employed as a supervisor." 61 Stat. 137-138, codified at 29 U. S. C. $ 152(3). Congress defined a supervisoras:

"[A]ny individual having authority, in the interest of theemployer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other em-ployees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their
grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, ifin connection with the foregoing the exercise of such
authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature,but requires the use of independent judgment." 61
Stat. 138, codified at 29 U. S. C. $ 152(11).
As the Board has stated, the statute requires the res-olution of three questions; and each must be answered in

the affirmative if an employee is to be deemed a super-visor. First, does the employee have authority to engage in

1 of the 12 listed activities? Second, does the exercise ofthat authority require "the use of independent judgment"?
Third, does the employee hold the authority "in the interest of the employer"? Northcrest Nursing Home, 313N. L. R. B. 491, 493 (1993). This case concerns only the

third question, and our decision turns upon the proper inter-pretation of the statutory phrase "in the interest of the
employer."In cases involving nurses, the Board admits that it has
interpreted the statutory phrase in a unique manner. Tr. of
Oral Arg. 52 (Board: "[t]he Board has not applied a theory
that's phrased in the same terms to other categories of professionals"). The Board has held that "a nurse's direction of
less-skilled employees, in the exercise of professional judgment incidental to the treatment of patients, is not authority
exercised `in the interest of the employer.' " Pet. for Cert.
15. As stated in reviewing its position on this issue in its
recent decision in Northcrest Nursing Home, supra, at 491-
492, the Board believes that its special interpretation of "in
the interest of the employer" in cases involving nurses is
necessary because professional employees (including registered nurses) are not excluded from coverage under the Act.
See 29 U. S. C. $ 152(12). Respondent counters that "[t]here
is simply no basis in the language of the statute to conclude
that direction given to aides in the interest of nursing home
residents, pursuant to professional norms, is not `in the interest of the employer.' " Brief for Respondent 30.

In this case, the Board's General Counsel issued a complaint alleging that respondent, the owner and operator of
the Heartland Nursing Home in Urbana, Ohio, had committed unfair labor practices in disciplining four licensed
practical nurses. At Heartland, the Director of Nursing has
overall responsibility for the nursing department. There is
also an Assistant Director of Nursing, 9 to 11 staff nurses

(including both registered nurses and the four licensed prac-tical nurses involved in this case), and 50 to 55 nurses' aides.

The staff nurses are the senior ranking employees on dutyafter 5 p.m. during the week and at all times on weekends--
approximately 75% of the time. The staff nurses have responsibility to ensure adequate staffing; to make daily workassignments; to monitor the aides' work to ensure proper

performance; to counsel and discipline aides; to resolve aides'problems and grievances; to evaluate aides' performances;
and to report to management. In light of these varied activ-ities, respondent contended, among other things, that the
four nurses involved in this case were supervisors, and so
not protected under the Act. The Administrative Law
Judge (ALJ) disagreed, concluding that the nurses were not
supervisors. The ALJ stated that the nurses' supervisory
work did not "equate to responsibly . . . direct[ing] the aides
in the interest of the employer," noting that "the nurses'
focus is on the well-being of the residents rather than of the
employer." 306 N. L. R. B. 68, 70 (1992) (internal quotation
marks omitted) (emphasis added). The Board stated only
that "[t]he judge found, and we agree, that the Respondent's
staff nurses are employees within the meaning of the Act."
306 N. L. R. B. 63, 63, n. 1 (1992).

The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
reversed. 987 F. 2d 1256 (1993). The Court of Appeals had
decided in earlier cases that the Board's test for determining
the supervisory status of nurses was inconsistent with the
statute. See Beverly California Corp. v. NLRB, 970 F. 2d
1548 (1992); NLRB v. Beacon Light Christian Nursing
Home, 825 F. 2d 1076 (1987). In Beverly, for example, the
court had stated that "the notion that direction given to subordinate personnel to ensure that the employer's nursing
home customers receive `quality care' somehow fails to qualify as direction given `in the interest of the employer' makes
very little sense to us." 970 F. 2d, at 1552. Addressing the
instant case, the court followed Beverly and again held the

Opinion of the Court

Board's interpretation inconsistent with the statute. 987 F.2d, at 1260. The court further stated that "it is up to Congress to carve out an exception for the health care field, in-cluding nurses, should Congress not wish for such nurses to
be considered supervisors." Id., at 1261. The court "re-mind[ed] the Board that it is the courts, and not the Board,
who bear the final responsibility for interpreting the law."
Id., at 1260. After concluding that the Board's test was in-consistent with the statute, the court found that the four

licensed practical nurses involved in this case were supervi-sors. Id., at 1260-1261.

We granted certiorari, 510 U. S. 810 (1993), to resolve theconflict in the Courts of Appeals over the validity of the
Board's rule. See, e. g., Waverly-Cedar Falls Health Care
Center, Inc. v. NLRB, 933 F. 2d 626 (CA8 1991); NLRB v.Res-Care, Inc., 705 F. 2d 1461 (CA7 1983); Misericordia Hospital Medical Center v. NLRB, 623 F. 2d 808 (CA2 1980).

II
We must decide whether the Board's test for determiningif nurses are supervisors is rational and consistent with the

Act. See Fall River Dyeing & Finishing Corp. v. NLRB,482 U. S. 27, 42 (1987). We agree with the Court of Appeals
that it is not. A

The Board's interpretation, that a nurse's supervisory ac-tivity is not exercised in the interest of the employer if it is
incidental to the treatment of patients, is similar to an ap-proach the Board took, and we rejected, in NLRB v. Yeshiva
Univ., 444 U. S. 672 (1980). There, we had to determinewhether faculty members at Yeshiva were "managerial employees." Managerial employees are those who "formulateand effectuate management policies by expressing and making operative the decisions of their employer." NLRB v.
Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U. S. 267, 288 (1974) (internal quota-tion marks omitted). Like supervisory employees, manage511us2$54L 11-05-97 14:07:43 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
rial employees are excluded from the Act's coverage. Id., at283 ("so clearly outside the Act that no specific exclusionary

provision was thought necessary"). The Board in Yeshivaargued that the faculty members were not managerial, contending that faculty authority was "exercised in the faculty's
own interest rather than in the interest of the university."444 U. S., at 685. To support its position, the Board placed

much reliance on the faculty members' independent profes-sional role in designing the curriculum and in discharging
their professional obligations to the students. We found theBoard's reasoning unpersuasive:

"In arguing that a faculty member exercising independ-ent judgment acts primarily in his own interest and
therefore does not represent the interest of his em-ployer, the Board assumes that the professional interests of the faculty and the interests of the institution aredistinct, separable entities with which a faculty member
could not simultaneously be aligned. The Court of
Appeals found no justification for this distinction, andwe perceive none. In fact, the faculty's professional

interests--as applied to governance at a universitylike Yeshiva--cannot be separated from those of the
institution.". . . The `business' of a university is education."

Id.,
at 688.

The Board's reasoning fares no better here than it did in
Yeshiva. As in Yeshiva, the Board has created a false di-chotomy--in this case, a dichotomy between acts taken in

connection with patient care and acts taken in the interest
of the employer. That dichotomy makes no sense. Patient
care is the business of a nursing home, and it follows that
attending to the needs of the nursing home patients, who are
the employer's customers, is in the interest of the employer.
See Beverly California, supra, at 1553. We thus see no
basis for the Board's blanket assertion that supervisory au511us2$54L 11-05-97 14:07:43 PAGES OPINPGT

OF AMERICA

Opinion of the Court

thority exercised in connection with patient care is somehownot in the interest of the employer.

Our conclusion is supported by the case that gave impetusto the statutory provision now before us. In

Packard
Motor, we considered the phrase "in the interest of an employer" contained in the definition of "employer" in the origi-nal 1935 Act. We stated that "[e]very employee, from the

very fact of employment in the master's business, is requiredto act in his interest." 330 U. S., at 488. We rejected the
argument of the dissenters who, like the Board in this case,advanced the proposition that the phrase covered only "those
who acted for management . . . in formulating [and] executing
its labor policies." Id., at 496 (Douglas, J., dissenting); cf.
Reply Brief for Petitioner 4 (filed July 23, 1993) (nurses are
supervisors when, "in addition to performing their professional duties and responsibilities, they also possess the authority to affect the job status or pay of employees working
under them"). Consistent with the ordinary meaning of the
phrase, the Court in Packard Motor determined that acts
within the scope of employment or on the authorized business of the employer are "in the interest of the employer."
330 U. S., at 488-489. There is no indication that Congress
intended any different meaning when it included the phrase
in the statutory definition of supervisor later in 1947. To be
sure, Congress altered the result of Packard Motor, but it
did not change the meaning of the phrase "in the interest of
the employer" when doing so. And we of course have rejected the argument that a statute altering the result
reached by a judicial decision necessarily changes the meaning of the language interpreted in that decision. See Public
Employees Retirement System of Ohio v. Betts, 492 U. S.
158, 168 (1989).

Not only is the Board's test inconsistent with Yeshiva,
Packard Motor, and the ordinary meaning of the phrase "in
the interest of the employer," it also renders portions of the
statutory definition in $ 2(11) meaningless. Under $ 2(11),

579Cite as: 511 U. S. 571 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
an employee who in the course of employment uses independ-ent judgment to engage in 1 of the 12 listed activities, including responsible direction of other employees, is a supervisor.Under the Board's test, however, a nurse who in the course
of employment uses independent judgment to engage in responsible direction of other employees is not a supervisor.Only a nurse who in the course of employment uses independent judgment to engage in one of the activities relatedto another employee's job status or pay can qualify as a supervisor under the Board's test. See Reply Brief for Peti-tioner 4 (filed July 23, 1993) (nurses are supervisors when
they affect "job status or pay of employees working under
them"). The Board provides no plausible justification, however, for reading the responsible direction portion of $ 2(11)
out of the statute in nurse cases, and we can perceive none.

The Board defends its test by arguing that phrases in

$ 2(11) such as "independent judgment" and "responsibly to
direct" are ambiguous, so the Board needs to be given ample
room to apply them to different categories of employees.
That is no doubt true, but it is irrelevant in this particular
case because interpretation of those phrases is not the underpinning of the Board's test. The Board instead has placed
exclusive reliance on the "in the interest of the employer"
language in $ 2(11). With respect to that particular phrase,
we find no ambiguity supporting the Board's position. It
should go without saying, moreover, that ambiguity in one
portion of a statute does not give the Board license to distort
other provisions of the statute. Yet that is what the Board
seeks us to sanction in this case.

The interpretation of the "in the interest of the employer"
language mandated by our precedents and by the ordinary
meaning of the phrase does not render the phrase meaningless in the statutory definition. The language ensures, for
example, that union stewards who adjust grievances are not
considered supervisory employees and deprived of the Act's
protections. But the language cannot support the Board's

OF AMERICA

Opinion of the Court

argument that supervision of the care of patients is not inthe interest of the employer. The welfare of the patient,

after all, is no less the object and concern of the employerthan it is of the nurses. And the statutory dichotomy the
Board has created is no more justified in the health care fieldthan it would be in any other business where supervisory
duties are a necessary incident to the production of goods orthe provision of services.

B
Because the Board's test is inconsistent with both the stat-utory language and this Court's precedents, the Board seeks

to shift ground, putting forth a series of nonstatutory argu-ments. None of them persuades us that we can ignore the
statutory language and our case law.The Board first contends that we should defer to its test
because, according to the Board, granting organizationalrights to nurses whose supervisory authority concerns patient care does not threaten the conflicting loyalties that thesupervisor exception was designed to avoid. Brief for Petitioner 25. We rejected the same argument in Yeshivawhere the Board contended that there was "no danger of
divided loyalty and no need for the managerial exclusion" forthe Yeshiva faculty members. 444 U. S., at 684. And we
must reject that reasoning again here. The Act is to be en-forced according to its own terms, not by creating legal categories inconsistent with its meaning, as the Board has donein nurse cases. Whether the Board proceeds through adjudication or rulemaking, the statute must control the Board'sdecision, not the other way around. See Florida Power &
Light Co. v. Electrical Workers, 417 U. S. 790, 811 (1974); cf.
Packard Motor, supra, at 493 (rejecting resort to policy andlegislative history in interpreting meaning of the phrase "in

the interest of the employer"). Even on the assumption,moreover, that the statute permits consideration of the potential for divided loyalties so that a unique interpretationis permitted in the health care field, we do not share the

581Cite as: 511 U. S. 571 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
Board's confidence that there is no danger of divided loyaltyhere. Nursing home owners may want to implement policies to ensure that patients receive the best possible caredespite potential adverse reaction from employees working
under the nurses' direction. If so, the statute gives nursing
home owners the ability to insist on the undivided loyalty ofits nurses notwithstanding the Board's impression that there

is no danger of divided loyalty.The Board also argues that "[t]he statutory criterion of
having authority `in the interest of the employer' . . . mustnot be read so broadly that it overrides Congress's intention
to accord the protections of the Act to professional employees." Brief for Petitioner 26; see 29 U. S. C. $ 152(12). The
Act does not distinguish professional employees from other
employees for purposes of the definition of supervisor in

$ 2(11). The supervisor exclusion applies to "any individual"
meeting the statutory requirements, not to "any nonprofessional employee." In addition, the Board relied on the
same argument in Yeshiva, but to no avail. The Board argued that "the managerial exclusion cannot be applied in a
straightforward fashion to professional employees because
those employees often appear to be exercising managerial
authority when they are merely performing routine job duties." 444 U. S., at 683-684. Holding to the contrary, we
said that the Board could not support a statutory distinction
between the university's interest and the managerial interest
being exercised on its behalf. There is no reason for a different result here. To be sure, as recognized in Yeshiva,
there may be "some tension between the Act's exclusion of
[supervisory and] managerial employees and its inclusion of
professionals," but we find no authority for "suggesting that
that tension can be resolved" by distorting the statutory language in the manner proposed by the Board. Id., at 686.

Finally, as a reason for us to defer to its conclusion, the
Board cites legislative history of the 1974 amendments to
other sections of the Act. Those amendments did not alter

Opinion of the Court

the test for supervisory status in the health care field, yetthe Board points to a statement in a Committee Report expressing apparent approval of the Board's then-current ap-plication of its supervisory employee test to nurses. S. Rep.
No. 93-766, p. 6 (1974); see Yeshiva, supra, at 690, n. 30. Asan initial matter, it is far from clear that the Board in fact
had a consistent test for nurses before 1974. Compare Avon
Convalescent Center, Inc., 200 N. L. R. B. 702 (1972), withDoctors' Hospital of Modesto, Inc., 183 N. L. R. B. 950 (1970).

In any event, the isolated statement in the 1974 CommitteeReport does not represent an authoritative interpretation of
the phrase "in the interest of the employer," which was en-acted by Congress in 1947. "[I]t is the function of the courts
and not the Legislature, much less a Committee of one Houseof the Legislature, to say what an enacted statute means."
Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 566 (1988). Indeed, in
American Hospital Assn. v. NLRB, 499 U. S. 606 (1991), thepetitioner pointed to isolated statements from the same 1974

Senate Report cited here and argued that they revealed Con-gress' intent with respect to a provision of the original 1935
Act. We dismissed the argument, stating that such state-ments do not have "the force of law, for the Constitution is
quite explicit about the procedure that Congress must followin legislating."

Id., at 616; see also Betts, 492 U. S., at 168.In this case as well, we must reject the Board's reliance on

the 1974 Committee Report. If Congress wishes to enactthe policies of the Board, it can do so without indirection.

An examination of the professional's duties (or in this casethe duties of the four nonprofessional nurses) to determine

whether 1 or more of the 12 listed activities is performed ina manner that makes the employee a supervisor is, of course,
part of the Board's routine and proper adjudicative function.

Opinion of the Court
In cases involving nurses, that inquiry no doubt could leadthe Board in some cases to conclude that supervisory status

has not been demonstrated. The Board has not sought tosustain its decision on that basis here, however. It has chosen instead to rely on an industrywide interpretation of the
phrase "in the interest of the employer" that contravenesprecedents of this Court and has no relation to the ordinary

meaning of that language.To be sure, in applying $ 2(11) in other industries, the
Board on occasion reaches results reflecting a distinction be-tween authority arising from professional knowledge and authority encompassing front-line management prerogatives.
It is important to emphasize, however, that in almost all of
those cases (unlike in cases involving nurses) the Board's decisions did not result from manipulation of the statutory
phrase "in the interest of the employer," but instead from a
finding that the employee in question had not met the other
requirements for supervisory status under the Act, such as
the requirement that the employee exercise one of the listed
activities in a nonroutine manner. See supra, at 573 (listing
other requirements for supervisory status). That may explain why the Board did not cite in its submissions to this
Court a single case outside the health care field approving
the interpretation of "in the interest of the employer" the
Board uses in nurse cases. That the Board sometimes finds
a professional employee not to be a supervisor when applying other elements of the statutory definition of $ 2(11) cannot be shoehorned into the conclusion that the Board can rely
on its strained interpretation of the phrase "in the interest of
the employer" in all nurse cases. If we accepted the Board's
position in this case, moreover, nothing would prevent the
Board from applying this interpretation of "in the interest
of the employer" to all professional employees.

We note further that our decision casts no doubt on Board
or court decisions interpreting parts of $ 2(11) other than the
specific phrase "in the interest of the employer." Because

the Board's interpretation of "in the interest of the em-ployer" is for the most part confined to nurse cases, our decision will have almost no effect outside that context. Anyparade of horribles about the meaning of this decision for
employees in other industries is thus quite misplaced; indeed,
the Board does not make that argument.In sum, the Board's test for determining the supervisory

status of nurses is inconsistent with the statute and our prec-edents. The Board did not petition this Court to uphold its
order in this case under any other theory. See Brief forRespondent 21, n. 25. If the case presented the question
whether these nurses were supervisors under the propertest, we would have given a lengthy exposition and analysis
of the facts in the record. But as we have indicated, the
Board made and defended its decision by relying on the particular test it has applied to nurses. Our conclusion that the
Court of Appeals was correct to find the Board's test inconsistent with the statute therefore suffices to resolve the case.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Affirmed.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Blackmun, Justice Stevens, and Justice Souter join, dissenting.

The National Labor Relations Act, 29 U. S. C. $ 151 et seq.,
guarantees organizational, representational, and bargaining
rights to "employees," but expressly excludes "supervisors"
from that protected class. See $$ 157, 152(3). Section 2(11)
of the Act defines the term "supervisor" by, first, enumerating 12 supervisory actions (including, for example, hiring,
firing, disciplining, assigning, and "responsibly" directing)
and, further, prescribing that "any individual" who has "authority, in the interest of the employer," to perform or "effectively to recommend" any of these actions is a supervisor,
provided that the exercise of such authority requires "independent judgment" rather than "merely routine or clerical"
action. $ 152(11).

In contrast to its exclusion of supervisors, the Act ex-pressly includes "professional employees" within its protections.1 Section 2(12) defines "professional employee" as onewhose work is "predominantly intellectual and varied in
character," involves "the consistent exercise of discretionand judgment in its performance," produces a result that
"cannot be standardized in relation to a given period of
time," and requires knowledge "in a field of science or learn-ing customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized

intellectual instruction and study in an institution of higherlearning or a hospital." 29 U. S. C. $ 152(12)(a).

The categories "supervisor" and "professional" necessarilyoverlap. Individuals within the overlap zone--those who

are both "supervisor" and "professional"--are excluded fromthe Act's coverage. For that reason, the scope accorded the
Act's term "supervisor" determines the extent to which pro-fessionals are covered. If the term "supervisor" is construed broadly, to reach everyone with any authority to use
"independent judgment" to assign and "responsibly . . . direct" the work of other employees, then most professionals
would be supervisors, for most have some authority to assign
and direct others' work. If the term "supervisor" is understood that broadly, however, Congress' inclusion of professionals within the Act's protections would effectively be
nullified.

The separation of "supervisors," excluded from the Act's
compass, from "professionals," sheltered by the Act, is a task
Congress committed to the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB or Board) in the first instance. The Board's attempt

1 See $ 152(12) (defining "professional employee"); $ 159(b) (limiting National Labor Relations Board's discretion to place professional and nonprofessional employees in the same bargaining unit).

have completed the required course of study and are "performing related
work under the supervision of a professional person" in order finally to
qualify as a professional. $ 152(12)(b).

to carry out that charge is the matter under examination inthis case.

The controversy before the Court involves the employ-ment status of certain licensed practical nurses at Heartland
Nursing Home in Urbana, Ohio. Unlike registered nurses,who are professional employees, licensed practical nurses are
considered "technical" employees. The Board, however, ap-plies the same test of supervisory status to licensed practical
nurses as it does to registered nurses where, as in this case,the practical nurses have the same duties as registered
nurses. See 306 N. L. R. B. 68, 69, n. 5 (1992) (duties of staffnurses at Heartland, the evidence showed, "were virtually
the same whether the nurses were [licensed practical nurses]or [registered nurses]"); Ohio Masonic Home, Inc., 295
N. L. R. B. 390, 394-395, and n. 1 (1989); cf. NLRB v. Res-Care, Inc., 705 F. 2d 1461, 1466 (CA7 1983) (licensed practical
nurses "are, if not full-fledged professionals, at leastsub-professionals").

Through case-by-case adjudication, the Board has soughtto distinguish individuals exercising the level of control that
truly places them in the ranks of management, from highlyskilled employees, whether professional or technical, who
perform, incidentally to their skilled work, a limited super-visory role. I am persuaded that the Board's approach is
rational and consistent with the Act. I would thereforeuphold the administrative determination, affirmed by the
Board, that Heartland's practical nurses are protectedemployees.

As originally enacted in 1935, the National Labor Rela-tions Act (Act), 29 U. S. C. $ 151

et seq., did not expresslyexclude supervisors from the class of "employees" entitled to

the Act's protections. See $$ 7, 2(3), 49 Stat. 452, 450. TheBoard decided in Packard Motor Co., 61 N. L. R. B. 4 (1945),
that in the absence of an express exclusion, supervisors mustbe held within the Act's coverage. This Court agreed,

(1947).Congress responded by excluding supervisors in the
Labor-Management Relations Act, 1947.3 The Senate Com-mittee Report noted that the Senate's definition of "supervisor" 4 had been framed with a view to assuring that"the employees . . . excluded from the coverage of the act
[would] be truly supervisory." S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong.,1st Sess., 19 (1947) (hereinafter Senate Report), Legislative

limited "to individuals generally regarded as foremen andpersons of like or higher rank"). As the Senate Report
explains:

"[T]he committee has not been unmindful of the fact thatcertain employees with minor supervisory duties have

problems which may justify their inclusion [within theprotections of the Act]. It has therefore distinguished
between straw bosses, leadmen, set-up men, and otherminor supervisory employees, on the one hand, and the
supervisor vested with such genuine management pre-rogatives as the right to hire or fire, discipline, or make

3 Section 2(11) of the Act defines a "supervisor" as "any individual having authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend,
lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or
effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing
the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature,
but requires the use of independent judgment." 29 U. S. C. $ 152(11).
Section 2(3) provides, in part, that "[t]he term `employee' . . . shall not

Nevertheless, because most professionals supervise tosome extent, the Act's inclusion of professionals is in tension
with its exclusion of supervisors. The Act defines a supervi-sor as "any individual" with authority to use "independent
judgment" "to . . . assign . . . other employees, or responsibly

"(a) any employee engaged in work (i) predominantly intellectual and
varied in character as opposed to routine mental, manual, mechanical, or
physical work; (ii) involving the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment in its performance; (iii) of such a character that the output produced
or the result accomplished cannot be standardized in relation to a given

to direct them." Professionals, by definition, exercise inde-pendent judgment, see 29 U. S. C. $ 152(12), and most professionals have authority to assign tasks to other employeesand "responsibly to direct" their work. See NLRB v. ResCare, Inc., 705 F. 2d 1461, 1465 (CA7 1983) (Posner, J.)("[M]ost professionals have some supervisory responsibilities
in the sense of directing another's work--the lawyer his sec-retary, the teacher his teacher's aide, the doctor his nurses,
the registered nurse her nurse's aide, and so on."). If pos-session of such authority and the exercise of independent
judgment were sufficient to classify an individual as a statu-tory "supervisor," then few professionals would receive the
Act's protections, contrary to Congress' express intentioncategorically to include "professional employees."

A

The NLRB has recognized and endeavored to cope withthe tension between the Act's exclusion of supervisors and

its inclusion of professional employees. See, e. g., Northcrest
Nursing Home, 313 N. L. R. B. 491 (1993). To harmonizethe two prescriptions, the Board has properly focused on the

policies that motivated Congress to exclude supervisors. Ac-counting for the exclusion of supervisors, the Act's drafters
emphasized that employers must have the "undivided loy-alty" of those persons, "traditionally regarded as part of
management," on whom they have bestowed "such genuinemanagement prerogatives as the right to hire or fire, discipline, or make effective recommendations with respect tosuch action." See Senate Report, at 3-4, Legislative History 409-410 (quoted in Northcrest Nursing Home, 313N. L. R. B., at 491. Accordingly, the NLRB classifies as supervisors individuals who use independent judgment in theexercise of managerial or disciplinary authority over other
employees. Id., at 493-494. But because professional em-ployees often are not in management's "front line," the "undi511us2$54P 11-05-97 14:07:43 PAGES OPINPGT

vided loyalty" concern is somewhat less urgent for this classof workers. The Board has therefore determined that the

exercise of professional judgment "to assign and direct otheremployees in the interest of providing high quality and efficient service" does not, by itself, "confer supervisory status."
Id., at 494.The NLRB has essayed this exposition of its inquiry:

"In determining the existence of supervisory status,the Board must first determine whether the individual
possesses any of the 12 indicia of supervisory authorityand, if so, whether the exercise of that authority entails
`independent judgment' or is `merely routine.' If theindividual independently exercises supervisory authority, the Board must then determine if that authorityis exercised `in the interest of the employer.' "

Id., at493.

As applied to the health-care field, the Board has reasonedthat to fit the formulation "in the interest of the employer,"
the nurse's superintendence of others must reflect key mana-gerial authority, and not simply control attributable to the
nurse's "professional or technical status," direction incidentalto "sound patient care." Id., at 493, 496. Cf. Children's
Habilitation Center, Inc. v. NLRB, 887 F. 2d 130, 134 (CA71989) (Posner, J.) (authority does not fit within the "interest
of the employer" category if it is "exercised in accordancewith professional rather than business norms," i. e., in accordance with "professional standards rather than . . . thecompany's profit-maximizing objectives").

The NLRB's "patient care analysis" is not a rudderlessrule for nurses, but an application of the approach the

Board has pursued in other contexts. The Board hasemployed the distinction between authority arising from
professional knowledge, on one hand, and authority en511us2$54P 11-05-97 14:07:43 PAGES OPINPGT

(1980) (citing cases). Indicating approval of the NLRB'sgeneral approach to the Act's coverage of professionals, the
Court stated in Yeshiva:

"The Board has recognized that employees whose deci-sionmaking is limited to the routine discharge of professional duties in projects to which they have been as-signed cannot be excluded from coverage even if union
membership arguably may involve some divided loyalty.Only if an employee's activities fall outside the scope of
the duties routinely performed by similarly situated pro-fessionals will he be found aligned with management.
We think these decisions accurately capture the intentof Congress . . . ."

Id., at 690 (footnote omitted).

Notably, in determining whether, in a concrete case,nurses are supervisors within the meaning of the Act, the

Board has drawn particularly upon its decisions in "leadper-son" controversies. "Leadpersons" include skilled employees who do not qualify as statutory "professionals," but, likeprofessional employees, have some authority to assign or direct other workers. In leadperson cases, as in cases involv-ing professionals, the NLRB has distinguished between
authority that derives from superior skill or experience,and authority that "flows from management and tends to
identify or associate a worker with management." Southwhich direction is incidental to the practice of their profession, and thus
is not the exercise of supervisory authority in the interest of the Employer." Id., at 1273, n. 9.

(1974): "[A]n employee with special expertise or training who directs or

Nursing Home, 313 N. L. R. B., at 494-495 (drawing the anal-ogy between leadpersons and charge nurses in hospitals and
nursing homes). Differentiating the role of front-line man-agers from that of leadperson, the Board has placed some
nurses, because of the level of their authority, in the supervi-sor category, while ranking others, as in this case, in a professional (or technical), but not supervisor, class. See casescited in

id., at 498, n. 36. III

Following the pattern revealed in NLRB decisions, theAdministrative Law Judge (ALJ), affirmed by the Board, determined that the four licensed practical nurses in this casewere not supervisors. The ALJ closely examined the organization and operation of nursing care at Heartland andfound the nurses' direction of aides "closely akin to the kind
of directing done by leadmen or straw bosses, persons . . .Congress plainly considered to be `employees.' " 306
N. L. R. B., at 70. Backing up this finding, the ALJ pointedout that, although the nurses "g[a]ve orders (of certain kinds)
to the aides, and the aides follow[ed] those orders," id., at 72,the nurses "spen[t] only a small fraction of their time exercising that authority," id., at 69. Essentially, the nurses la-bored "to ensure that the needs of the residents [were] met,"
and to that end, they "check[ed] for changes in the health ofthe residents, administer[ed] medicine, . . . receive[d] status
reports from the nurses they relieve[d], and g[a]ve [such] re-ports to aides coming on duty and to the nurses' reliefs,"
pinch-hit for aides in "bathing, feeding or dressing resi-dents," and "handle[d] incoming telephone calls from physicians and from relatives of residents who want[ed] informa-tion about a resident's condition."

Ibid.The ALJ noted, too, that "when setting up the aideresident assignments," the nurses "followed old patterns";indeed, "the nurses routinely let the aides decide among

themselves which aide was to cover which residents." Id.,at 70. The administrator and the director of nursing were

"always on call" and nurses in fact called them at their homes"when non-routine matters ar[o]se." Id., at 72.

Throughout the hearing, the ALJ reported, he gained "theimpression that Heartland's administrator believed that the
nurses' views about anything other than hands-on care ofthe residents were not worth considering."

Ibid. "[T]heactions of Heartland's administrator," the ALJ concluded,

repeatedly and unmistakably demonstrated that "to [Heart-land's] management, Heartland's nurses were just hired
hands." Ibid. I see no tenable basis for rejecting theALJ's ultimate ruling that the nurses' jobs did not entail
genuine, front-line supervisory status of the kind that wouldexclude them from the Act's protection.

IV

A
The phrase ultimately limiting the $ 2(11) classification"supervisor" is, as the Court recognizes, "in the interest of

the employer." To give that phrase meaning as a discreteand potent limitation, the Board has construed it, in diverse
contexts, to convey more than the obligation all employeeshave to further the employer's business interests, indeed
more than the authority to assign and direct other employeespursuant to relevant professional standards. See,

e. g.,
Northcrest Nursing Home, 313 N. L. R. B. 491 (1993)(nurses); Youth Guidance Center, 263 N. L. R. B. 1330, 1335,

and n. 23 (1982) (social workers); Sav-On Drugs, Inc., 243N. L. R. B. 859, 862 (1979) (pharmacists); Neighborhood Legal
Services, Inc., 236 N. L. R. B. 1269, 1273, and n. 9 (1978)(attorneys).

13 It is a defining task of management to formu13 The Board, as the decisions cited in text demonstrate, takes no unique
approach in cases involving nurses. See also cases cited, supra, at 591-
592, nn. 6-7, 9, 12. Nor, contrary to the Court's report, see ante, at 574,
did counsel for the NLRB admit to deviant interpretation of the phrase,

late and execute labor policies for the shop; correspondingly,
the persons charged with superintending management policy
regarding labor are the "supervisors" who, in the Board's
view, act "in the interest of the employer."

Maintaining professional standards of course serves the
interest of an enterprise, and the NLRB is hardly blind to
that obvious point. See Northcrest Nursing Home, 313
N. L. R. B., at 494 (interest of employer and employees not
likely to diverge on charge nurse decisions concerning methods of attending to patients' needs). But "the interest of
the employer" may well tug against that of employees, on
matters such as "hiring, firing, discharging, and fixing
pay"; "in the interest of the employer," persons with authority regarding "things of that sort" are properly ranked
"supervisor." 14

"interest of the employer," in nurses' cases. When asked whether "[i]t is
uniquely nurses" who do not act "in the interest of the employer" when
attending to "the needs of the customer," counsel replied, "No, it is not
uniquely nurses." Tr. of Oral Arg. 52. While counsel continued, when
pressed, to say that "[t]he Board has not applied a theory that's phrased
in the same terms to other categories of professionals," ibid., counsel appears to have been referring to the precisely particularized, "patient care"
version of the inquiry. Counsel added: "What the Board has done is draw
an analogy between . . . what nurses do and what other minor supervisory
employees do. . . . [T]he Board's rule in this case is fully consistent with
the traditional rule that it has applied." Id., at 53.

Case bill, passed by Congress, but vetoed by President Truman in 1946.
Representative Case stated of the bill's provision, nearly identical to the
present $ 2(11): " `In the interest of the employer'--that is the key phrase
to keep in mind. . . . All that the section on supervisory employees does is
to say that if `in the interest of the employer,' [a] person has a primary
responsibility in hiring, firing, discharging, and fixing pay, and things of
that sort, then at the bargaining table he shall not sit on the side of the
employee, but shall sit on the side of the employer. . . . No man can serve
two masters. If you are negotiating a contract, a lawyer does not represent both clients. That is all that is involved here."

OF AMERICA

Ginsburg, J., dissenting

The Court does not deny that the phrase "in the interestof the employer" was intended to limit, not to expand, the

category "supervisor." 15 Yet the reading the Court gives tothe phrase allows it to provide only one example of workers
who would not fit the description: "The language ensures . . .that union stewards who adjust grievances are not considered supervisory employees and deprived of the Act's protec-tions."

Ante, at 579. Section 2(11)'s expression, "in the in-terest of the employer," however, modifies all 12 of the listed

supervisory activities, not just the adjustment of grievances.Tellingly, the single example the Court gives, "union stewards who adjust grievances," rests on the very distinctionthe Board has endeavored to apply in all quarters of the
workplace: one between "management" interests peculiar tothe employer, and the sometimes conflicting interests of
employees.16

15 The Court does maintain, however, that Congress meant to embrace
our statement in Packard Motor Car Co. v. NLRB, 330 U. S. 485 (1947),
that "[e]very employee, from the very fact of employment in the master's
business, is required to act in his interest." Id., at 488; see ante, at 578.
But Congress' purpose, in enacting $ 2(11), was to overturn the Court's
holding in Packard Motor Car. Thus it is more likely that Congress was
taken by Justice Douglas' dissenting view that "acting in the interest of
the employer" fits employees who act for management "not only in formulating but also in executing its labor policies." 330 U. S., at 496. Moreover, Congress had included the phrase, "in the interest of the employer,"
the year before Packard Motor Car, in a predecessor bill to the LaborManagement Relations Act that defined the term "supervisor" almost
identically. See n. 14, supra. Finally, the Court acknowledged in Packard Motor Car that the phrase "interest of the employer" may also be
read more narrowly, in contradistinction to employees' interests in improving their compensation and working conditions. 330 U. S., at 489, 490.
Packard Motor Car, then, does not support the conclusion that the words,
"interest of the employer," have a plain meaning inconsistent with the
interpretation the Board has given them in supervisor cases.

16 The Court suggests that the Board has "rea[d] the responsible direction portion of $ 2(11) out of the statute in nurse cases." Ante, at 579
(referring to the words "responsibly to direct" in $ 2(11)'s list of supervisory activities). The author of the amendment that inserted those words

597Cite as: 511 U. S. 571 (1994)

Congress adopted the supervisor exclusion to bind to man-agement those persons "vested with . . . genuine management prerogatives," Senate Report, at 4, Legislative History410, i. e., those with the authority and duty to act specifically
"in the interest of the employer" on matters as to whichmanagement and labor interests may divide. The Board has
been faithful to the task Congress gave it, I believe, in distin-guishing the employer's hallmark managerial interest--its
interest regarding labor-management relations--from thegeneral interest of the enterprise, shared by its professional
and technical employees, in providing high-quality service.

B
In rejecting the Board's approach, the Court relies heavilyon NLRB v. Yeshiva Univ., 444 U. S. 672 (1980). The heavy

weight placed on Yeshiva is puzzling, for the Court in thatcase noted with approval the Board's decisions differentiating professional team leaders (or "project captains") from"supervisors." Such leaders are "employees," not "supervisors," the Board held, and the Court agreed, "despite [their]substantial planning responsibility and authority to direct
and evaluate team members." Id., at 690, n. 30. "In thehealth-care context," specifically, the Court in

Yeshiva ob-served, "the Board asks in each case whether the decisions

alleged to be managerial or supervisory are `incidental to' or`in addition to' the treatment of patients." That approach,
the Court said in Yeshiva, "accurately capture[d] the intentof Congress."

Id., at 690.

explained, however, that persons having authority "responsibly to direct"
other employees are persons with "essential managerial duties" who rank
"above the grade of `straw bosses, lead men, set-up men, and other minor
supervisory employees,' as enumerated in the [Senate] report." 93 Cong.
Rec. 4678 (1947), Legislative History 1303 (remarks of Sen. Flanders). As
explained above, the Board has used this same analogy to straw bosses
and leadpersons to determine whether particular nurses are supervisors.
See supra, at 592-593.

The Court today also expresses doubt whether "the stat-ute permits consideration of the potential for divided loyalties." Ante, at 580 (implying that consideration of this po-tential would entail a "unique interpretation [of the statute]
. . . in the health care field"). But again, Yeshiva points theother way. The Court's opinion in

Yeshiva acknowledgedthat the Act's exclusion of supervisors "grow[s] out of the . . .

concern . . . [t]hat an employer is entitled to the undividedloyalty of its representatives." 444 U. S., at 682. The
Court decided that the Yeshiva University faculty memberswere not entitled to the Act's protection, precisely because
their role as "representative" of the employer presented agrave danger of divided loyalties. The Yeshiva faculty, the
Court stated, was pivotal in defining and implementing theemployer's managerial interests; its "authority in academic
matters [wa]s absolute," and it "determine[d] . . . the productto be produced, the terms upon which it will be offered, and
the customers who will be served." Id., at 686. No plausi-ble equation can be made between the self-governing Yeshiva faculty, on one hand, and on the other, the licensedpractical nurses involved in this case, with their limited authority to assign and direct the work of nurses' aides, pursu-ant to professional standards.

V
The Court's opinion has implications far beyond the nursesinvolved in this case. If any person who may use independent judgment to assign tasks to others or direct their workis a supervisor, then few professionals employed by organizations subject to the Act will receive its protections.17 The

all it took to be a statutory supervisor were a showing that an employee
gives discretionary direction to an aide, even though done pursuant to the
customary norms of the profession, the coverage of professionals would be
a virtual nullity." Brief for Petitioner 27; see also id., at 12, Reply Brief

STAPLES v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 92-1441. Argued November 30, 1993--Decided May 23, 1994
The National Firearms Act criminalizes possession of an unregistered

"firearm," 26 U. S. C. $ 5861(d), including a "machinegun," $ 5845(a)(6),
which is defined as a weapon that automatically fires more than one
shot with a single pull of the trigger, $ 5845(b). Petitioner Staples was
charged with possessing an unregistered machinegun in violation of

$ 5861(d) after officers searching his home seized a semiautomatic rifle--
i. e., a weapon that normally fires only one shot with each trigger pull--
that had apparently been modified for fully automatic fire. At trial,
Staples testified that the rifle had never fired automatically while he
possessed it and that he had been ignorant of any automatic firing capability. He was convicted after the District Court rejected his proposed
jury instruction under which, to establish a $ 5861(d) violation, the Government would have been required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt
that Staples knew that the gun would fire fully automatically. The
Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that the Government need not
prove a defendant's knowledge of a weapon's physical properties to obtain a conviction under $ 5861(d).

Held: To obtain a $ 5861(d) conviction, the Government should have been

required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Staples knew that his
rifle had the characteristics that brought it within the statutory definition of a machinegun. Pp. 604-619.

(a) The common-law rule requiring mens rea as an element of a crime
informs interpretation of $ 5861(d) in this case. Because some indication of congressional intent, express or implied, is required to dispense
with mens rea, $ 5861(d)'s silence on the element of knowledge required
for a conviction does not suggest that Congress intended to dispense
with a conventional mens rea requirement, which would require that
the defendant know the facts making his conduct illegal. Pp. 604-606.

(b) The Court rejects the Government's argument that the Act fits
within the Court's line of precedent concerning "public welfare" or "regulatory" offenses and thus that the presumption favoring mens rea does
not apply in this case. In cases concerning public welfare offenses, the
Court has inferred from silence a congressional intent to dispense with
conventional mens rea requirements in statutes that regulate potentially harmful or injurious items. In such cases, the Court has reasoned

601Cite as: 511 U. S. 600 (1994)
Syllabus
that as long as a defendant knows that he is dealing with a dangerous
device of a character that places him in responsible relation to a public
danger, he should be alerted to the probability of strict regulation, and
is placed on notice that he must determine at his peril whether his conduct comes within the statute's inhibition. See, e. g., United States v.
Balint, 258 U. S. 250; United States v. Freed, 401 U. S. 601. Guns, however, do not fall within the category of dangerous devices as it has been
developed in public welfare offense cases. In contrast to the selling of
dangerous drugs at issue in Balint or the possession of hand grenades
considered in Freed, private ownership of guns in this country has enjoyed a long tradition of being entirely lawful conduct. Thus, the destructive potential of guns in general cannot be said to put gun owners
sufficiently on notice of the likelihood of regulation to justify interpreting $ 5861(d) as dispensing with proof of knowledge of the characteristics
that make a weapon a "firearm" under the statute. The Government's
interpretation potentially would impose criminal sanctions on a class of
persons whose mental state--ignorance of the characteristics of weapons in their possession--makes their actions entirely innocent. Had
Congress intended to make outlaws of such citizens, it would have spoken more clearly to that effect. Pp. 606-616.

(c) The potentially harsh penalty attached to violation of $ 5861(d)--
up to 10 years' imprisonment--confirms the foregoing reading of the
Act. Where, as here, dispensing with mens rea would require the defendant to have knowledge only of traditionally lawful conduct, a severe
penalty is a further factor tending to suggest that Congress did not
intend to eliminate a mens rea requirement. Pp. 616-619.

(d) The holding here is a narrow one that depends on a commonsense
evaluation of the nature of the particular device Congress has subjected
to regulation, the expectations that individuals may legitimately have
in dealing with that device, and the penalty attached to a violation.
It does not set forth comprehensive criteria for distinguishing between crimes that require a mental element and crimes that do not.
Pp. 619-620.

Assistant Attorney General Keeney, Deputy Solicitor Gen-eral Bryson, and John F. De Pue.

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
The National Firearms Act makes it unlawful for any per-son to possess a machinegun that is not properly registered

with the Federal Government. Petitioner contends that, toconvict him under the Act, the Government should have been
required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he knewthe weapon he possessed had the characteristics that
brought it within the statutory definition of a machinegun.We agree and accordingly reverse the judgment of the Court
of Appeals. I

The National Firearms Act (Act), 26 U. S. C. $$ 5801-5872,imposes strict registration requirements on statutorily defined "firearms." The Act includes within the term "fire-arm" a machinegun, $ 5845(a)(6), and further defines a machinegun as "any weapon which shoots, . . . or can be readilyrestored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger,"$ 5845(b). Thus, any fully automatic weapon is a "firearm"
within the meaning of the Act.1 Under the Act, all firearmsmust be registered in the National Firearms Registration
and Transfer Record maintained by the Secretary of theTreasury. $ 5841. Section 5861(d) makes it a crime, punish1 As used here, the terms "automatic" and "fully automatic" refer to a
weapon that fires repeatedly with a single pull of the trigger. That is,
once its trigger is depressed, the weapon will automatically continue to
fire until its trigger is released or the ammunition is exhausted. Such
weapons are "machineguns" within the meaning of the Act. We use the
term "semiautomatic" to designate a weapon that fires only one shot with
each pull of the trigger, and which requires no manual manipulation by the
operator to place another round in the chamber after each round is fired.

Opinion of the Court
able by up to 10 years in prison, see $ 5871, for any personto possess a firearm that is not properly registered.

Upon executing a search warrant at petitioner's home,local police and agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms (BATF) recovered, among other things, an AR-15
rifle. The AR-15 is the civilian version of the military'sM-16 rifle, and is, unless modified, a semiautomatic weapon.

The M-16, in contrast, is a selective fire rifle that allows theoperator, by rotating a selector switch, to choose semiautomatic or automatic fire. Many M-16 parts are interchange-able with those in the AR-15 and can be used to convert the
AR-15 into an automatic weapon. No doubt to inhibit such
conversions, the AR-15 is manufactured with a metal stop
on its receiver that will prevent an M-16 selector switch,
if installed, from rotating to the fully automatic position.
The metal stop on petitioner's rifle, however, had been filed
away, and the rifle had been assembled with an M-16 selector switch and several other M-16 internal parts, including a hammer, disconnector, and trigger. Suspecting that
the AR-15 had been modified to be capable of fully automatic fire, BATF agents seized the weapon. Petitioner subsequently was indicted for unlawful possession of an unregistered machinegun in violation of $ 5861(d).

At trial, BATF agents testified that when the AR-15 was
tested, it fired more than one shot with a single pull of the
trigger. It was undisputed that the weapon was not registered as required by $ 5861(d). Petitioner testified that the
rifle had never fired automatically when it was in his possession. He insisted that the AR-15 had operated only semiautomatically, and even then imperfectly, often requiring manual ejection of the spent casing and chambering of the next
round. According to petitioner, his alleged ignorance of any
automatic firing capability should have shielded him from
criminal liability for his failure to register the weapon. He
requested the District Court to instruct the jury that, to
establish a violation of $ 5861(d), the Government must prove

Opinion of the Court
beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant "knew thatthe gun would fire fully automatically." 1 App. to Brief for

Appellant in No. 91-5033 (CA10), p. 42.The District Court rejected petitioner's proposed instruction and instead charged the jury as follows:

"The Government need not prove the defendant knowshe's dealing with a weapon possessing every last characteristic [which subjects it] 2 to the regulation. It wouldbe enough to prove he knows that he is dealing with a

dangerous device of a type as would alert one to thelikelihood of regulation." Tr. 465.

Petitioner was convicted and sentenced to five years' proba-tion and a $5,000 fine.

The Court of Appeals affirmed. Relying on its decision inUnited States v. Mittleider, 835 F. 2d 769 (CA10 1987), cert.
denied, 485 U. S. 980 (1988), the court concluded that theGovernment need not prove a defendant's knowledge of a
weapon's physical properties to obtain a conviction under$ 5861(d). 971 F. 2d 608, 612-613 (CA10 1992). We granted
certiorari, 508 U. S. 939 (1993), to resolve a conflict in theCourts of Appeals concerning the

mens rea required under$ 5861(d).

A

Whether or not $ 5861(d) requires proof that a defendantknew of the characteristics of his weapon that made it a

"firearm" under the Act is a question of statutory construc-tion. As we observed in Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S.
419 (1985), "[t]he definition of the elements of a criminal of-fense is entrusted to the legislature, particularly in the case
of federal crimes, which are solely creatures of statute."Id., at 424 (citing United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32

Opinion of the Court
(1812)). Thus, we have long recognized that determiningthe mental state required for commission of a federal crime

requires "construction of the statute and . . . inference ofthe intent of Congress."

United States v. Balint, 258 U. S.
250, 253 (1922). See also Liparota, supra, at 423.

The language of the statute, the starting place in our in-quiry, see

Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249,
253-254 (1992), provides little explicit guidance in this case.Section 5861(d) is silent concerning the

mens rea required
for a violation. It states simply that "[i]t shall be unlawfulfor any person . . . to receive or possess a firearm which is

not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration
and Transfer Record." 26 U. S. C. $ 5861(d). Nevertheless,
silence on this point by itself does not necessarily suggest
that Congress intended to dispense with a conventional mens
rea element, which would require that the defendant know
the facts that make his conduct illegal. See Balint, supra,
at 251 (stating that traditionally, "scienter" was a necessary
element in every crime). See also n. 3, infra. On the contrary, we must construe the statute in light of the background rules of the common law, see United States v. United
States Gypsum Co., 438 U. S. 422, 436-437 (1978), in which
the requirement of some mens rea for a crime is firmly embedded. As we have observed, "[t]he existence of a mens
rea is the rule of, rather than the exception to, the principles
of Anglo-American criminal jurisprudence." Id., at 436 (internal quotation marks omitted). See also Morissette v.
United States, 342 U. S. 246, 250 (1952) ("The contention that
an injury can amount to a crime only when inflicted by intention is no provincial or transient notion. It is as universal
and persistent in mature systems of law as belief in freedom
of the human will and a consequent ability and duty of the
normal individual to choose between good and evil").

There can be no doubt that this established concept has
influenced our interpretation of criminal statutes. Indeed,
we have noted that the common-law rule requiring mens rea

511us2$55N 11-03-97 22:18:59 PAGES OPINPGT
606 STAPLES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
has been "followed in regard to statutory crimes even wherethe statutory definition did not in terms include it."

Balint,
supra, at 251-252. Relying on the strength of the tradi-tional rule, we have stated that offenses that require no

mens rea generally are disfavored, Liparota, supra, at 426,
and have suggested that some indication of congressional in-tent, express or implied, is required to dispense with

mens
rea as an element of a crime. Cf. United States Gypsum,
supra, at 438; Morissette, supra, at 263.

According to the Government, however, the nature andpurpose of the Act suggest that the presumption favoring

mens rea does not apply to this case. The Government argues that Congress intended the Act to regulate and restrict
the circulation of dangerous weapons. Consequently, in the
Government's view, this case fits in a line of precedent concerning what we have termed "public welfare" or "regulatory" offenses, in which we have understood Congress to impose a form of strict criminal liability through statutes that
do not require the defendant to know the facts that make
his conduct illegal. In construing such statutes, we have
inferred from silence that Congress did not intend to require
proof of mens rea to establish an offense.

For example, in Balint, we concluded that the Narcotic
Act of 1914, which was intended in part to minimize the
spread of addictive drugs by criminalizing undocumented
sales of certain narcotics, required proof only that the defendant knew that he was selling drugs, not that he knew
the specific items he had sold were "narcotics" within the
ambit of the statute. See Balint, supra, at 254. Cf. United
States v. Dotterweich, 320 U. S. 277, 281 (1943) (stating in
dicta that a statute criminalizing the shipment of adulterated
or misbranded drugs did not require knowledge that the
items were misbranded or adulterated). As we explained
in Dotterweich, Balint dealt with "a now familiar type of
legislation whereby penalties serve as effective means of
regulation. Such legislation dispenses with the conven511us2$55N 11-03-97 22:19:00 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tional requirement for criminal conduct--awareness of somewrongdoing." 320 U. S., at 280-281. See also Morissette,

supra, at 252-256.Such public welfare offenses have been created by Congress, and recognized by this Court, in "limited circum-stances."

United States Gypsum, supra, at 437. Typically,our cases recognizing such offenses involve statutes that

regulate potentially harmful or injurious items. Cf. UnitedStates v. International Minerals & Chemical Corp., 402
U. S. 558, 564-565 (1971) (characterizing Balint and similarcases as involving statutes regulating "dangerous or deleterious devices or products or obnoxious waste materials").In such situations, we have reasoned that as long as a defendant knows that he is dealing with a dangerous device of acharacter that places him "in responsible relation to a public
danger," Dotterweich, supra, at 281, he should be alerted tothe probability of strict regulation, and we have assumed
that in such cases Congress intended to place the burden onthe defendant to "ascertain at his peril whether [his conduct]
comes within the inhibition of the statute." Balint, supra,at 254. Thus, we essentially have relied on the nature of the
statute and the particular character of the items regulatedto determine whether congressional silence concerning the
mental element of the offense should be interpreted as dis-pensing with conventional mens rea requirements. See
generally Morissette, supra, at 252-260.3

3 By interpreting such public welfare offenses to require at least that
the defendant know that he is dealing with some dangerous or deleterious
substance, we have avoided construing criminal statutes to impose a rigorous form of strict liability. See, e. g., United States v. International Minerals & Chemical Corp., 402 U. S. 558, 563-564 (1971) (suggesting that if
a person shipping acid mistakenly thought that he was shipping distilled
water, he would not violate a statute criminalizing undocumented shipping
of acids). True strict liability might suggest that the defendant need not
know even that he was dealing with a dangerous item. Nevertheless, we
have referred to public welfare offenses as "dispensing with" or "eliminating" a mens rea requirement or "mental element," see, e. g., Morissette,

Opinion of the Court

B
The Government argues that $ 5861(d) defines preciselythe sort of regulatory offense described in

Balint. In thisview, all guns, whether or not they are statutory "firearms,"

are dangerous devices that put gun owners on notice thatthey must determine at their hazard whether their weapons
come within the scope of the Act. On this understanding,the District Court's instruction in this case was correct, because a conviction can rest simply on proof that a defendantknew he possessed a "firearm" in the ordinary sense of the
term.The Government seeks support for its position from our
decision in United States v. Freed, 401 U. S. 601 (1971), whichinvolved a prosecution for possession of unregistered grenades under $ 5861(d).4 The defendant knew that the itemsin his possession were grenades, and we concluded that

$ 5861(d) did not require the Government to prove the de-fendant also knew that the grenades were unregistered.
Id., at 609. To be sure, in deciding that mens rea was notrequired with respect to that element of the offense, we sug342 U. S., at 250, 263; United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U. S. 277, 281
(1943), and have described them as strict liability crimes, United States v.
United States Gypsum Co., 438 U. S. 422, 437 (1978). While use of the
term "strict liability" is really a misnomer, we have interpreted statutes
defining public welfare offenses to eliminate the requirement of mens rea;
that is, the requirement of a "guilty mind" with respect to an element of
a crime. Under such statutes we have not required that the defendant
know the facts that make his conduct fit the definition of the offense. Generally speaking, such knowledge is necessary to establish mens rea, as is
reflected in the maxim ignorantia facti excusat. See generally J. Hawley & M. McGregor, Criminal Law 26-30 (1899); R. Perkins, Criminal Law
785-786 (2d ed. 1969); G. Williams, Criminal Law: The General Part 113-
174 (1953). Cf. Queen v. Tolson, 23 Q. B. 168, 187 (1889) (Stephen, J.)
("[I]t may, I think, be maintained that in every case knowledge of fact
[when not appearing in the statute] is to some extent an element of criminality as much as competent age and sanity").

4 A grenade is a "firearm" under the Act. 26 U. S. C. $$ 5845(a)(8),

5845(f)(1)(B).

gested that the Act "is a regulatory measure in the in-terest of the public safety, which may well be premised on

the theory that one would hardly be surprised to learn thatpossession of hand grenades is not an innocent act."

Ibid.
Grenades, we explained, "are highly dangerous offensive
weapons, no less dangerous than the narcotics involved in
United States v. Balint." Ibid. But that reasoning provides little support for dispensing with mens rea in this case.As the Government concedes,

Freed did not address the
issue presented here. In Freed, we decided only that$ 5861(d) does not require proof of knowledge that a firearm is unregistered. The question presented by a defendant
who possesses a weapon that is a "firearm" for purposes of
the Act, but who knows only that he has a "firearm" in the
general sense of the term, was not raised or considered.
And our determination that a defendant need not know that
his weapon is unregistered suggests no conclusion concerning whether $ 5861(d) requires the defendant to know of the
features that make his weapon a statutory "firearm"; different elements of the same offense can require different mental
states. See Liparota, 471 U. S., at 423, n. 5; United States
v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394, 405-406 (1980). See also W. LaFave & A. Scott, Handbook on Criminal Law 194-195 (1972).
Moreover, our analysis in Freed likening the Act to the public welfare statute in Balint rested entirely on the assumption that the defendant knew that he was dealing with hand
grenades--that is, that he knew he possessed a particularly
dangerous type of weapon (one within the statutory definition of a "firearm"), possession of which was not entirely
"innocent" in and of itself. 401 U. S., at 609. The predicate for that analysis is eliminated when, as in this case, the
very question to be decided is whether the defendant must
know of the particular characteristics that make his weapon
a statutory firearm.

Notwithstanding these distinctions, the Government urges
that Freed's logic applies because guns, no less than gre511us2$55N 11-03-97 22:19:00 PAGES OPINPGT
610 STAPLES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
nades, are highly dangerous devices that should alert theirowners to the probability of regulation. But the gap between Freed and this case is too wide to bridge. In glossingover the distinction between grenades and guns, the Government ignores the particular care we have taken to avoid construing a statute to dispense with mens rea where doingso would "criminalize a broad range of apparently innocent

conduct." Liparota, 471 U. S., at 426. In Liparota, we con-sidered a statute that made unlawful the unauthorized acquisition or possession of food stamps. We determined thatthe statute required proof that the defendant knew his
possession of food stamps was unauthorized, largely because
dispensing with such a mens rea requirement would have
resulted in reading the statute to outlaw a number of apparently innocent acts. Ibid. Our conclusion that the statute
should not be treated as defining a public welfare offense
rested on the commonsense distinction that a "food stamp
can hardly be compared to a hand grenade." Id., at 433.

Neither, in our view, can all guns be compared to hand
grenades. Although the contrast is certainly not as stark as
that presented in Liparota, the fact remains that there is a
long tradition of widespread lawful gun ownership by private
individuals in this country. Such a tradition did not apply
to the possession of hand grenades in Freed or to the selling
of dangerous drugs that we considered in Balint. See also
International Minerals, 402 U. S., at 563-565; Balint, 258
U. S., at 254. In fact, in Freed we construed $ 5861(d) under
the assumption that "one would hardly be surprised to learn
that possession of hand grenades is not an innocent act."
Freed, supra, at 609. Here, the Government essentially
suggests that we should interpret the section under the altogether different assumption that "one would hardly be surprised to learn that owning a gun is not an innocent act."
That proposition is simply not supported by common experience. Guns in general are not "deleterious devices or products or obnoxious waste materials," International Minerals,

Opinion of the Court
supra, at 565, that put their owners on notice that they stand"in responsible relation to a public danger," Dotterweich, 320

U. S., at 281.The Government protests that guns, unlike food stamps,
but like grenades and narcotics, are potentially harmful de-vices.

5 Under this view, it seems that Liparota's concern

for criminalizing ostensibly innocuous conduct is inapplicablewhenever an item is sufficiently dangerous--that is, dangerousness alone should alert an individual to probable regula-tion and justify treating a statute that regulates the dangerous device as dispensing with mens rea. But that an itemis "dangerous," in some general sense, does not necessarily
suggest, as the Government seems to assume, that it is notalso entirely innocent. Even dangerous items can, in some
cases, be so commonplace and generally available that wewould not consider them to alert individuals to the likelihood
of strict regulation. As suggested above, despite their po-tential for harm, guns generally can be owned in perfect innocence. Of course, we might surely classify certain catego-ries of guns--no doubt including the machineguns, sawed-off
shotguns, and artillery pieces that Congress has subjected to

5 The dissent's assertions to the contrary notwithstanding, the Government's position, "[a]ccurately identified," post, at 632, is precisely that "guns
in general" are dangerous items. The Government, like the dissent, cites
Sipes v. United States, 321 F. 2d 174, 179 (CA8), cert. denied, 375 U. S. 913
(1963), for the proposition that a defendant's knowledge that the item he
possessed "was a gun" is sufficient for a conviction under $ 5861(d). Brief
for United States 21. Indeed, the Government argues that "guns" should
be placed in the same category as the misbranded drugs in Dotterweich
and the narcotics in Balint because " `one would hardly be surprised to
learn' (Freed, 401 U. S. at 609) that there are laws that affect one's rights
of gun ownership." Brief for United States 22. The dissent relies upon
the Government's repeated contention that the statute requires knowledge
that "the item at issue was highly dangerous and of a type likely to be
subject to regulation." Id., at 9. But that assertion merely patterns the
general language we have used to describe the mens rea requirement in
public welfare offenses and amounts to no more than an assertion that the
statute should be treated as defining a public welfare offense.

Opinion of the Court
regulation--as items the ownership of which would have thesame quasi-suspect character we attributed to owning hand

grenades in Freed. But precisely because guns falling out-side those categories traditionally have been widely accepted
as lawful possessions, their destructive potential, while per-haps even greater than that of some items we would classify
along with narcotics and hand grenades, cannot be said toput gun owners sufficiently on notice of the likelihood of regulation to justify interpreting $ 5861(d) as not requiring proofof knowledge of a weapon's characteristics.

6

6 The dissent asserts that the question is not whether all guns are deleterious devices, but whether a gun "such as the one possessed by petitioner," post, at 632 (which the dissent characterizes as a "semiautomatic
weapon that [is] readily convertible into a machinegun," post, at 624, 633,
640), is such a device. If the dissent intends to suggest that the category
of readily convertible semiautomatics provides the benchmark for defining
the knowledge requirement for $ 5861(d), it is difficult to see how it derives
that class of weapons as a standard. As explained above, see n. 5, supra,
the Government's argument has nothing to do with this ad hoc category
of weapons. And the statute certainly does not suggest that any significance should attach to readily convertible semiautomatics, for that class
bears no relation to the definitions in the Act. Indeed, in the absence of
any definition, it is not at all clear what the contours of this category
would be. The parties assume that virtually all semiautomatics may be
converted into automatics, and limiting the class to those "readily" convertible provides no real guidance concerning the required mens rea. In
short, every owner of a semiautomatic rifle or handgun would potentially
meet such a mens rea test.

But the dissent apparently does not conceive of the mens rea requirement in terms of specific categories of weapons at all, and rather views it
as a more fluid concept that does not require delineation of any concrete
elements of knowledge that will apply consistently from case to case. The
dissent sees no need to define a class of items the knowing possession of
which satisfies the mens rea element of the offense, for in the dissent's
view the exact content of the knowledge requirement can be left to the
jury in each case. As long as the jury concludes that the item in a given
case is "sufficiently dangerous to alert [the defendant] to the likelihood of
regulation," post, at 637, the knowledge requirement is satisfied. See also
post, at 624, 639, 640. But the mens rea requirement under a criminal
statute is a question of law, to be determined by the court. Our decisions

613Cite as: 511 U. S. 600 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
On a slightly different tack, the Government suggests thatguns are subject to an array of regulations at the federal,

state, and local levels that put gun owners on notice thatthey must determine the characteristics of their weapons
and comply with all legal requirements.7 But regulation initself is not sufficient to place gun ownership in the category
of the sale of narcotics in Balint. The food stamps at issue
in Liparota were subject to comprehensive regulations, yetwe did not understand the statute there to dispense with a

mens rea requirement. Moreover, despite the overlay oflegal restrictions on gun ownership, we question whether
regulations on guns are sufficiently intrusive that they im-pinge upon the common experience that owning a gun is
usually licit and blameless conduct. Roughly 50 percent of
suggesting that public welfare offenses require that the defendant know
that he stands in "responsible relation to a public danger," Dotterweich,
320 U. S., at 281, in no way suggest that what constitutes a public danger
is a jury question. It is for courts, through interpretation of the statute,
to define the mens rea required for a conviction. That task cannot be
reduced to setting a general "standard," post, at 637, that leaves it to
the jury to determine, based presumably on the jurors' personal opinions,
whether the items involved in a particular prosecution are sufficiently dangerous to place a person on notice of regulation.

Moreover, as our discussion above should make clear, to determine as
a threshold matter whether a particular statute defines a public welfare
offense, a court must have in view some category of dangerous and deleterious devices that will be assumed to alert an individual that he stands
in "responsible relation to a public danger." Dotterweich, supra, at 281.
The truncated mens rea requirement we have described applies precisely
because the court has determined that the statute regulates in a field
where knowing possession of some general class of items should alert individuals to probable regulation. Under the dissent's approach, however, it
seems that every regulatory statute potentially could be treated as a public welfare offense as long as the jury--not the court--ultimately determines that the specific items involved in a prosecution were sufficiently
dangerous.

7 See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $$ 921-928 (1988 ed. and Supp. IV) (requiring licensing of manufacturers, importers, and dealers of guns and regulating
the sale, possession, and interstate transportation of certain guns).

Opinion of the Court
American homes contain at least one firearm of some sort,8and in the vast majority of States, buying a shotgun or rifle

is a simple transaction that would not alert a person to regu-lation any more than would buying a car.

If we were to accept as a general rule the Government's
suggestion that dangerous and regulated items place their
owners under an obligation to inquire at their peril into compliance with regulations, we would undoubtedly reach some
untoward results. Automobiles, for example, might also be
termed "dangerous" devices and are highly regulated at both
the state and federal levels. Congress might see fit to criminalize the violation of certain regulations concerning automobiles, and thus might make it a crime to operate a vehicle
without a properly functioning emission control system.
But we probably would hesitate to conclude on the basis of
silence that Congress intended a prison term to apply to a
car owner whose vehicle's emissions levels, wholly unbeknownst to him, began to exceed legal limits between regular inspection dates.

Here, there can be little doubt that, as in Liparota, the
Government's construction of the statute potentially would
impose criminal sanctions on a class of persons whose mental
state--ignorance of the characteristics of weapons in their

possession--makes their actions entirely innocent.10 TheGovernment does not dispute the contention that virtually any semiautomatic weapon may be converted, either byinternal modification or, in some cases, simply by wear and
tear, into a machinegun within the meaning of the Act.Cf.

United States v. Anderson, 885 F. 2d 1248, 1251, 1253-1254 (CA5 1989) (en banc). Such a gun may give no externally visible indication that it is fully automatic. See UnitedStates v. Herbert, 698 F. 2d 981, 986 (CA9), cert. denied, 464
U. S. 821 (1983). But in the Government's view, any personwho has purchased what he believes to be a semiautomatic
rifle or handgun, or who simply has inherited a gun from arelative and left it untouched in an attic or basement, can
be subject to imprisonment, despite absolute ignorance ofthe gun's firing capabilities, if the gun turns out to be an
automatic.We concur in the Fifth Circuit's conclusion on this point:
"It is unthinkable to us that Congress intended to subjectsuch law-abiding, well-intentioned citizens to a possible tenyear term of imprisonment if . . . what they genuinely andreasonably believed was a conventional semi-automatic
[weapon] turns out to have worn down into or been secretlymodified to be a fully automatic weapon." Anderson, supra,
at 1254. As we noted in Morissette, the "purpose and obvi-ous effect of doing away with the requirement of a guilty
intent is to ease the prosecution's path to conviction." 342U. S., at 263.

11 The Government contends that Congress intended precisely such an

aid to obtaining convictions, because requiring proof of knowledge would
place too heavy a burden on the Government and obstruct the proper
functioning of $ 5861(d). Cf. United States v. Balint, 258 U. S. 250, 254

to require mens rea). But knowledge can be inferred from circumstantial

Opinion of the Court
Congress where, as here, it would mean easing the path toconvicting persons whose conduct would not even alert them

to the probability of strict regulation in the form of a statutesuch as $ 5861(d).

C
The potentially harsh penalty attached to violation of$ 5861(d)--up to 10 years' imprisonment--confirms our reading of the Act. Historically, the penalty imposed under astatute has been a significant consideration in determining
whether the statute should be construed as dispensing withmens rea. Certainly, the cases that first defined the concept
of the public welfare offense almost uniformly involved stat-utes that provided for only light penalties such as fines or
short jail sentences, not imprisonment in the state peniten-tiary. See,

e. g., Commonwealth v. Raymond, 97 Mass. 567
(1867) (fine of up to $200 or six months in jail, or both); Commonwealth v. Farren, 91 Mass. 489 (1864) (fine); People v.
Snowburger, 113 Mich. 86, 71 N. W. 497 (1897) (fine of up to
$500 or incarceration in county jail).12As commentators have pointed out, the small penalties

attached to such offenses logically complemented the absence
of a mens rea requirement: In a system that generally reevidence, including any external indications signaling the nature of the
weapon. And firing a fully automatic weapon would make the regulated
characteristics of the weapon immediately apparent to its owner. In
short, we are confident that when the defendant knows of the characteristics of his weapon that bring it within the scope of the Act, the Government will not face great difficulty in proving that knowledge. Of course,
if Congress thinks it necessary to reduce the Government's burden at trial
to ensure proper enforcement of the Act, it remains free to amend $ 5861(d)
by explicitly eliminating a mens rea requirement.

12 Leading English cases developing a parallel theory of regulatory offenses similarly involved violations punishable only by fine or short-term
incarceration. See, e. g., Queen v. Woodrow, 15 M. & W. 404, 153 Eng.
Rep. 907 (Ex. 1846) (fine of #200 for adulterated tobacco); Hobbs v. Winchester Corp., [1910] 2 K. B. 471 (maximum penalty of three months' imprisonment for sale of unwholesome meat).

quires a "vicious will" to establish a crime, 4 W. Blackstone,
Commentaries *21, imposing severe punishments for offenses that require no mens rea would seem incongruous.
See Sayre, Public Welfare Offenses, 33 Colum. L. Rev. 55, 70
(1933). Indeed, some courts justified the absence of mens
rea in part on the basis that the offenses did not bear the
same punishments as "infamous crimes," Tenement House
Dept. v. McDevitt, 215 N. Y. 160, 168, 109 N. E. 88, 90 (1915)
(Cardozo, J.), and questioned whether imprisonment was
compatible with the reduced culpability required for such
regulatory offenses. See, e. g., People ex rel. Price v. Sheffield Farms-Slawson-Decker Co., 225 N. Y. 25, 32-33, 121
N. E. 474, 477 (1918) (Cardozo, J.); id., at 35, 121 N. E., at
478 (Crane, J., concurring) (arguing that imprisonment for a
crime that requires no mens rea would stretch the law regarding acts mala prohibita beyond its limitations).13 Similarly, commentators collecting the early cases have argued
that offenses punishable by imprisonment cannot be understood to be public welfare offenses, but must require mens
rea. See R. Perkins, Criminal Law 793-798 (2d ed. 1969)
(suggesting that the penalty should be the starting point in
determining whether a statute describes a public welfare offense); Sayre, supra, at 72 ("Crimes punishable with prison
sentences . . . ordinarily require proof of a guilty intent").14

In rehearsing the characteristics of the public welfare offense, we, too, have included in our consideration the punishments imposed and have noted that "penalties commonly are
relatively small, and conviction does no grave damage to an

13 Cf. Queen v. Tolson, 23 Q. B., at 177 (Wills, J.) (In determining whether
a criminal statute dispenses with mens rea, "the nature and extent of the
penalty attached to the offence may reasonably be considered. There is
nothing that need shock any mind in the payment of a small pecuniary
penalty by a person who has unwittingly done something detrimental to
the public interest").

offender's reputation." Morissette, 342 U. S., at 256.15 Wehave even recognized that it was "[u]nder such considerations" that courts have construed statutes to dispense withmens rea. Ibid.

Our characterization of the public welfare offense in
Morissette hardly seems apt, however, for a crime that is afelony, as is violation of $ 5861(d).

16 After all, "felony" is, as

we noted in distinguishing certain common-law crimes frompublic welfare offenses, " `as bad a word as you can give to

man or thing.' " Id., at 260 (quoting 2 F. Pollock & F. Mait-land, History of English Law 465 (2d ed. 1899)). Close adherence to the early cases described above might suggestthat punishing a violation as a felony is simply incompatible
with the theory of the public welfare offense. In this view,absent a clear statement from Congress that

mens rea is
not required, we should not apply the public welfare offense
rationale to interpret any statute defining a felony offenseas dispensing with

mens rea. But see United States v.
Balint, 258 U. S. 250 (1922).We need not adopt such a definitive rule of construction

to decide this case, however. Instead, we note only thatwhere, as here, dispensing with

mens rea would require the
defendant to have knowledge only of traditionally lawful con-duct, a severe penalty is a further factor tending to suggest

that Congress did not intend to eliminate a mens rea require15 See also United States Gypsum, 438 U. S., at 442, n. 18 (noting that
an individual violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act is a felony punishable
by three years in prison or a fine not exceeding $100,000 and stating that
"[t]he severity of these sanctions provides further support for our conclusion that the [Act] should not be construed as creating strict-liability
crimes"). Cf. Holdridge v. United States, 282 F. 2d 302, 310 (CA8 1960)
(Blackmun, J.) ("[W]here a federal criminal statute omits mention of intent
and . . . where the penalty is relatively small, where conviction does not
gravely besmirch, [and] where the statutory crime is not one taken over

criminal intent").

ment. In such a case, the usual presumption that a defend-ant must know the facts that make his conduct illegal

should apply. III

In short, we conclude that the background rule of thecommon law favoring mens rea should govern interpretation
of $ 5861(d) in this case. Silence does not suggest that Con-gress dispensed with

mens rea for the element of $ 5861(d)at issue here. Thus, to obtain a conviction, the Government

should have been required to prove that petitioner knew ofthe features of his AR-15 that brought it within the scope
of the Act.17We emphasize that our holding is a narrow one. As in
our prior cases, our reasoning depends upon a commonsenseevaluation of the nature of the particular device or substance
Congress has subjected to regulation and the expectationsthat individuals may legitimately have in dealing with the
regulated items. In addition, we think that the penaltyattached to $ 5861(d) suggests that Congress did not intend
to eliminate a mens rea requirement for violation of the sec-tion. As we noted in

Morissette: "Neither this Court nor,

17 In reaching our conclusion, we find it unnecessary to rely on the rule
of lenity, under which an ambiguous criminal statute is to be construed in
favor of the accused. That maxim of construction "is reserved for cases
where, `[a]fter "seiz[ing] every thing from which aid can be derived," ' the
Court is `left with an ambiguous statute.' " Smith v. United States, 508
U. S. 223, 239 (1993) (quoting United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 347
(1971), in turn quoting United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch 358, 386 (1805)).

States, 500 U. S. 453, 463 (1991) (rule of lenity inapplicable unless there is
a " `grievous ambiguity or uncertainty' " in the statute). Here, the background rule of the common law favoring mens rea and the substantial
body of precedent we have developed construing statutes that do not specify a mental element provide considerable interpretive tools from which
we can "seize aid," and they do not leave us with the ultimate impression
that $ 5861(d) is "grievous[ly]" ambiguous. Certainly, we have not concluded in the past that statutes silent with respect to mens rea are ambiguous. See, e. g., United States v. Balint, 258 U. S. 250 (1922).

definition here, either. We note only that our holding de-pends critically on our view that if Congress had intended
to make outlaws of gun owners who were wholly ignorantof the offending characteristics of their weapons, and to subject them to lengthy prison terms, it would have spokenmore clearly to that effect. Cf.

United States v. Harris, 959F. 2d 246, 261 (CADC), cert. denied, 506 U. S. 932 (1992).

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further

So ordered.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,concurring in the judgment.

The statute petitioner Harold E. Staples is charged withviolating, 26 U. S. C. $ 5861(d), makes it a crime for any person to "receive or possess a firearm which is not registered
to him." Although the word "knowingly" does not appearin the statute's text, courts generally assume that Congress,

absent a contrary indication, means to retain a mens rea re-quirement.

Ante, at 606; see Liparota v. United States, 471
U. S. 419, 426 (1985); United States v. United States Gypsum
Co., 438 U. S. 422, 437-438 (1978).1 Thus, our holding in
United States v. Freed, 401 U. S. 601 (1971), that $ 5861(d)
does not require proof of knowledge that the firearm is unregistered, rested on the premise that the defendant indeed

1 Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, we have not confined the presumption of mens rea to statutes codifying traditional common-law offenses, but have also applied the presumption to offenses that are "entirely
a creature of statute," post, at 625, such as those at issue in Liparota,
Gypsum, and, most recently, Posters `N' Things, Ltd. v. United States,
ante, at 522-523.

id., at 612 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) ("The
Government and the Court agree that the prosecutor mustprove knowing possession of the items and also knowledge

that the items possessed were hand grenades.").

Conviction under $ 5861(d), the Government accordinglyconcedes, requires proof that Staples "knowingly" possessed

the machinegun. Brief for United States 23. The questionbefore us is not

whether knowledge of possession is required,
but what level of knowledge suffices: (1) knowledge simplyof possession of the object; (2) knowledge, in addition, that

the object is a dangerous weapon; (3) knowledge, beyonddangerousness, of the characteristics that render the object subject to regulation, for example, awareness that the
weapon is a machinegun.2Recognizing that the first reading effectively dispenses

with mens rea, the Government adopts the second, contending that it avoids criminalizing "apparently innocent conduct," Liparota, supra, at 426, because under the second
reading, "a defendant who possessed what he thought was a
toy or a violin case, but which in fact was a machinegun,
could not be convicted." Brief for United States 23. The
Government, however, does not take adequate account of the
"widespread lawful gun ownership" Congress and the States
have allowed to persist in this country. See United States
v. Harris, 959 F. 2d 246, 261 (CADC) (per curiam), cert.
denied, 506 U. S. 932 (1992). Given the notable lack of comprehensive regulation, "mere unregistered possession of
certain types of [regulated weapons]--often [difficult to dis2 Some Courts of Appeals have adopted a variant of the third reading,
holding that the Government must show that the defendant knew the gun
was a machinegun, but allowing inference of the requisite knowledge
where a visual inspection of the gun would reveal that it has been converted into an automatic weapon. See United States v. O'Mara, 963 F. 2d

inadequate to establish the requisite knowledge. See 959
F. 2d, at 261.

The Nation's legislators chose to place under a registration
requirement only a very limited class of firearms, those they
considered especially dangerous. The generally "dangerous" character of all guns, the Court therefore observes,
ante, at 611-612, did not suffice to give individuals in Staples'
situation cause to inquire about the need for registration.
Cf. United States v. Balint, 258 U. S. 250 (1922) (requiring
reporting of sale of strictly regulated narcotics, opium and
cocaine). Only the third reading, then, suits the purpose of
the mens rea requirement--to shield people against punishment for apparently innocent activity.3

The indictment in Staples' case charges that he "knowingly received and possessed firearms." 1 App. to Brief for
Appellant in No. 91-5033 (CA10), p. 1.4 "Firearms" has a

3 The mens rea presumption requires knowledge only of the facts that
make the defendant's conduct illegal, lest it conflict with the related presumption, "deeply rooted in the American legal system," that, ordinarily,
"ignorance of the law or a mistake of law is no defense to criminal prosecution." Cheek v. United States, 498 U. S. 192, 199 (1991). Cf. United
States v. Freed, 401 U. S. 601, 612 (1971) (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) ("If the ancient maxim that `ignorance of the law is no excuse' has
any residual validity, it indicates that the ordinary intent requirement--
mens rea--of the criminal law does not require knowledge that an act is
illegal, wrong, or blameworthy."). The maxim explains why some "innocent" actors--for example, a defendant who knows he possesses a weapon
with all of the characteristics that subject it to registration, but was unaware of the registration requirement, or thought the gun was registered--may be convicted under $ 5861(d), see post, at 638. Knowledge of
whether the gun was registered is so closely related to knowledge of the
registration requirement that requiring the Government to prove the former would in effect require it to prove knowledge of the law. Cf. Freed,
supra, at 612-614 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment).

4 The indictment charged Staples with possession of two unregistered

machineguns, but the jury found him guilty of knowingly possessing only
one of them. Tr. 477.

circumscribed statutory definition. See 26 U. S. C. $ 5845(a).The "firear[m]" the Government contends Staples possessed

in violation of $ 5861(d) is a machinegun. See $ 5845(a)(6).The indictment thus effectively charged that Staples knowingly possessed a machinegun. "Knowingly possessed" log-ically means "possessed and knew that he possessed." The
Government can reconcile the jury instruction 5 with the in-dictment only on the implausible assumption that the term
"firear[m]" has two different meanings when used once in thesame charge--simply "gun" when referring to what petitioner knew, and "machinegun" when referring to what hepossessed. See Cunningham, Levi, Green, & Kaplan, Plain
Meaning and Hard Cases, 103 Yale L. J. 1561, 1576-1577(1994); cf.

Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U. S. 135, 143 (1994)(construing statutory term to bear same meaning "each time

it is called into play").For these reasons, I conclude that conviction under $ 5861(d)
requires proof that the defendant knew he possessed notsimply a gun, but a machinegun. The indictment in this
case, but not the jury instruction, properly described thisknowledge requirement. I therefore concur in the Court's
judgment.

5 The trial court instructed the jury:
"[A] person is knowingly in possession of a thing if his possession occurred
voluntarily and intentionally and not because of mistake or accident or
other innocent reason. The purpose of adding the word `knowingly' is to
insure that no one can be convicted of possession of a firearm he did not
intend to possess. The Government need not prove the defendant knows
he's dealing with a weapon possessing every last characteristic [which subjects it] to the regulation. It would be enough to prove he knows that he
is dealing with a dangerous device of a type as would alert one to the
likelihood of regulation. If he has such knowledge and if the particular
item is, in fact, regulated, then that person acts at his peril. Mere possession of an unregistered firearm is a violation of the law of the United
States, and it is not necessary for the Government to prove that the defendant knew that the weapon in his possession was a firearm within the
meaning of the statute, only that he knowingly possessed the firearm."

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Blackmun joins,dissenting.

To avoid a slight possibility of injustice to unsophisticatedowners of machineguns and sawed-off shotguns, the Court
has substituted its views of sound policy for the judgmentCongress made when it enacted the National Firearms Act
(or Act). Because the Court's addition to the text of 26U. S. C. $ 5861(d) is foreclosed by both the statute and our
precedent, I respectfully dissent.The Court is preoccupied with guns that "generally can
be owned in perfect innocence." Ante, at 611. This case,however, involves a semiautomatic weapon that was readily
convertible into a machinegun--a weapon that the jury foundto be " `a dangerous device of a type as would alert one to
the likelihood of regulation.' " Ante, at 604. These are notguns "of some sort" that can be found in almost "50 percent
of American homes." Ante, at 613-614.1 They are particu-larly dangerous--indeed, a substantial percentage of the unregistered machineguns now in circulation are convertedsemiautomatic weapons.

2

The question presented is whether the National FirearmsAct imposed on the Government the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt not only that the defendant knewhe possessed a dangerous device sufficient to alert him to

1 Indeed, only about 15 percent of all the guns in the United States
are semiautomatic. See National Rifle Association, Fact Sheet, SemiAutomatic Firearms 1 (Feb. 1, 1994). Although it is not known how many
of those weapons are readily convertible into machineguns, it is obviously
a lesser share of the total.

2 See U. S. Dept. of Justice, Attorney General's Task Force on Violent

Crime: Final Report 29, 32 (Aug. 17, 1981) (stating that over an 18-month
period over 20 percent of the machineguns seized or purchased by the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms had been converted from semiautomatic weapons by "simple tool work or the addition of readily available parts") (citing U. S. Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco

regulation, but also that he knew it had all the characteristics of a "firearm" as defined in the statute. Three unambiguous guideposts direct us to the correct answer to that question: the text and structure of the Act, our cases construing
both this Act and similar regulatory legislation, and the Act's
history and interpretation.

I

Contrary to the assertion by the Court, the text of the
statute does provide "explicit guidance in this case." Cf.
ante, at 605. The relevant section of the Act makes it "unlawful for any person . . . to receive or possess a firearm
which is not registered to him in the National Firearms
Registration and Transfer Record." 26 U. S. C. $ 5861(d).
Significantly, the section contains no knowledge requirement,
nor does it describe a common-law crime.

The common law generally did not condemn acts as criminal unless the actor had "an evil purpose or mental culpability," Morissette v. United States, 342 U. S. 246, 252 (1952),
and was aware of all the facts that made the conduct unlawful, United States v. Balint, 258 U. S. 250, 251-252 (1922).
In interpreting statutes that codified traditional common-law
offenses, courts usually followed this rule, even when the
text of the statute contained no such requirement. Ibid.
Because the offense involved in this case is entirely a creature of statute, however, "the background rules of the common law," cf. ante, at 605, do not require a particular construction, and critically different rules of construction apply.
See Morissette v. United States, 342 U. S., at 252-260.

In Morissette, Justice Jackson outlined one such interpretive rule:

"Congressional silence as to mental elements in an Act
merely adopting into federal statutory law a concept of
crime already . . . well defined in common law and statutory interpretation by the states may warrant quite contrary inferences than the same silence in creating an of511us2$55I 11-03-97 22:19:00 PAGES OPINPGT

fense new to general law, for whose definition the courtshave no guidance except the Act." Id., at 262.

Although the lack of an express knowledge requirement in$ 5861(d) is not dispositive, see United States v. United States
Gypsum Co., 438 U. S. 422, 438 (1978), its absence suggeststhat Congress did not intend to require proof that the defendant knew all of the facts that made his conduct illegal.3The provision's place in the overall statutory scheme, see
Crandon v. United States, 494 U. S. 152, 158 (1990), confirmsthis intention. In 1934, when Congress originally enacted
the statute, it limited the coverage of the 1934 Act to a rela-tively narrow category of weapons such as submachineguns
and sawed-off shotguns--weapons characteristically usedonly by professional gangsters like Al Capone, Pretty Boy
Floyd, and their henchmen.4 At the time, the Act wouldhave had little application to guns used by hunters or guns
kept at home as protection against unwelcome intruders.5

3 The Seventh Circuit's comment in a similar case is equally apt here:
"The crime is possessing an unregistered firearm--not `knowingly' possessing an unregistered firearm, or possessing a weapon knowing it to
be a firearm, or possessing a firearm knowing it to be unregistered. . . .
[Petitioner's] proposal is not that we interpret a knowledge or intent requirement in $ 5861(d); it is that we invent one." United States v. Ross,
917 F. 2d 997, 1000 (1990) (per curiam) (emphasis in original), cert. denied,
498 U. S. 1122 (1991).

4 "The late 1920s and early 1930s brought . . . a growing perception of

crime both as a major problem and as a national one. . . . [C]riminal
gangs found the submachinegun (a fully automatic, shoulder-fired weapon
utilizing automatic pistol cartridges) and sawed-off shotgun deadly for
close-range fighting." Hardy, The Firearms Owners' Protection Act: A
Historical and Legal Perspective, 17 Cumb. L. Rev. 585, 590 (1987).

5 The Senate Report on the bill explained: "The gangster as a law violator must be deprived of his most dangerous weapon, the machinegun.
Your committee is of the opinion that limiting the bill to the taxing of
sawed-off guns and machineguns is sufficient at this time. It is not
thought necessary to go so far as to include pistols and revolvers and
sporting arms. But while there is justification for permitting the citizen
to keep a pistol or revolver for his own protection without any restriction,

Congress therefore could reasonably presume that a person
found in possession of an unregistered machinegun or
sawed-off shotgun intended to use it for criminal purposes.
The statute as a whole, and particularly the decision to criminalize mere possession, reflected a legislative judgment that
the likelihood of innocent possession of such an unregistered
weapon was remote, and far less significant than the interest
in depriving gangsters of their use.

In addition, at the time of enactment, this Court had already construed comparable provisions of the Harrison
Anti-Narcotic Act not to require proof of knowledge of all
the facts that constitute the proscribed offense. United
States v. Balint, 258 U. S. 250 (1922).6 Indeed, Attorney
General Cummings expressly advised Congress that the text
of the gun control legislation deliberately followed the language of the Anti-Narcotic Act to reap the benefit of cases
construing it.7 Given the reasoning of Balint, we properly
may infer that Congress did not intend the Court to read a
stricter knowledge requirement into the gun control legislation than we read into the Anti-Narcotic Act. Cannon v.
University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 698-699 (1979).

Like the 1934 Act, the current National Firearms Act is
primarily a regulatory measure. The statute establishes

there is no reason why anyone except a law officer should have a machinegun or sawed-off shotgun." S. Rep. No. 1444, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 1-2
(1934).

6 In the Balint case, after acknowledging the general common-law rule

that made knowledge of the facts an element of every crime, we held that
as to statutory crimes the question is one of legislative intent, and that
the Anti-Narcotic Act should be construed to authorize "punishment of a
person for an act in violation of law[,] [even] when ignorant of the facts
making it so." Balint, 258 U. S., at 251-252. The "policy of the law may,
in order to stimulate proper care, require the punishment of the negligent
person though he be ignorant of the noxious character of what he sells."
Id., at 253.

As the Court acknowledges, ante, at 607, to interpret
statutory offenses such as $ 5861(d), we look to "the nature
of the statute and the particular character of the items regulated" to determine the level of knowledge required for
conviction. An examination of $ 5861(d) in light of our precedent dictates that the crime of possession of an unregistered machinegun is in a category of offenses described as
"public welfare" crimes.9 Our decisions interpreting such
offenses clearly require affirmance of petitioner's conviction.

"Public welfare" offenses share certain characteristics: (1)
they regulate "dangerous or deleterious devices or products

without thinking. Often the omission occurs because of lack of attention. . . . Yet Congress may have sound reasons for requiring people to
investigate and act, objectives that cannot be achieved if the courts add
mental elements to the statutes." Ross, 917 F. 2d, at 1000.

9 These statutes are sometimes referred to as "strict liability" offenses.

As the Court notes, because the defendant must know that he is engaged
in the type of dangerous conduct that is likely to be regulated, the use of
the term "strict liability" to describe these offenses is inaccurate. Ante,
at 607-608, n. 3. I therefore use the term "public welfare offense" to describe this type of statute.

(3) they "depend on no mental element but consist only of

such offenses include Congress' exertion of its power to keep

and adulterated foods and drugs 12 out of the channels of
commerce.13

Public welfare statutes render criminal "a type of conduct
that a reasonable person should know is subject to stringent
public regulation and may seriously threaten the community's health or safety." Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S.

be convicted even though he was unaware of the circumstances of his conduct that made it illegal." Id., at 443, n. 7

sanctions for unintended violations of the food and drug laws,
Justice Frankfurter wrote:

"Neither this Court nor, so far as we are aware, any other has undertaken to delineate a precise line or set forth comprehensive criteria for

fuse construction of the legislation if it is to be treated
as a working instrument of government and not merely
as a collection of English words. The prosecution . . .
is based on a now familiar type of legislation whereby
penalties serve as effective means of regulation. Such
legislation dispenses with the conventional requirement
for criminal conduct--awareness of some wrongdoing.
In the interest of the larger good it puts the burden of
acting at hazard upon a person otherwise innocent but
standing in responsible relation to a public danger."
United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U. S. 277, 280-281

(1943) (citing United States v. Balint, 258 U. S. 250
(1922); other citations omitted).

The National Firearms Act unquestionably is a public welfare statute. United States v. Freed, 401 U. S. 601, 609
(1971) (holding that this statute "is a regulatory measure
in the interest of the public safety"). Congress fashioned a
legislative scheme to regulate the commerce and possession of certain types of dangerous devices, including specific
kinds of weapons, to protect the health and welfare of the
citizenry. To enforce this scheme, Congress created criminal penalties for certain acts and omissions. The text of
some of these offenses--including the one at issue here--
contains no knowledge requirement.

The Court recognizes:

"[W]e have reasoned that as long as a defendant knows
that he is dealing with a dangerous device of a character
that places him `in responsible relation to a public danger,' Dotterweich, supra, at 281, he should be alerted to
the probability of strict regulation, and we have assumed that in such cases Congress intended to place the
burden on the defendant to `ascertain at his peril
whether [his conduct] comes within the inhibition of the
statute.' Balint, 258 U. S., at 254." Ante, at 607.

Stevens, J., dissenting
We thus have read a knowledge requirement into public welfare crimes, but not a requirement that the defendant know
all the facts that make his conduct illegal. Although the
Court acknowledges this standard, it nevertheless concludes
that a gun is not the type of dangerous device that would
alert one to the possibility of regulation.

Both the Court and Justice Ginsburg erroneously rely
upon the "tradition[al]" innocence of gun ownership to find
that Congress must have intended the Government to prove
knowledge of all the characteristics that make a weapon a
statutory "firear[m]." Ante, at 610-612; ante, at 621-622
(Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment). We held in Freed,
however, that a $ 5861(d) offense may be committed by one
with no awareness of either wrongdoing or of all the facts
that constitute the offense.14 401 U. S., at 607-610. Nevertheless, the Court, asserting that the Government "gloss[es]
over the distinction between grenades and guns," determines that "the gap between Freed and this case is too
wide to bridge." Ante, at 610. As such, the Court instead
reaches the rather surprising conclusion that guns are more
analogous to food stamps than to hand grenades.15 Even if

14 Freed, 401 U. S., at 607 (holding that a violation of $ 5861(d) may be
established without proof that the defendant was aware of the fact that
the firearm he possessed was unregistered). Our holding in Freed is thus
squarely at odds with the Court's conclusion that the "defendant must
know the facts that make his conduct illegal," ante, at 619.

15 The Court's and Justice Ginsburg's reliance upon Liparota v.

United States, 471 U. S. 419 (1985), is misplaced. Ante, at 610-612; ante,
at 621-622. Although the Court is usually concerned with fine nuances of
statutory text, its discussion of Liparota simply ignores the fact that the
food stamp fraud provision, unlike $ 5861(d), contained the word "knowingly." The Members of the Court in Liparota disagreed on the proper
interpretation. The dissenters accepted the Government's view that the
term merely required proof that the defendant had knowledge of the
facts that constituted the crime. See Liparota, 471 U. S., at 442-443

one accepts that dubious proposition, the Court founds it
upon a faulty premise: its mischaracterization of the Government's submission as one contending that "all guns . . . are
dangerous devices that put gun owners on notice . . . ."
Ante, at 608 (emphasis added).16 Accurately identified, the
Government's position presents the question whether guns
such as the one possessed by petitioner " `are highly dangerous offensive weapons, no less dangerous than the narcotics' "
in Balint or the hand grenades in Freed, see ante, at 609
(quoting Freed, 401 U. S., at 609).17

fact of illegality"). The majority, however, concluded that "knowingly"
also connoted knowledge of illegality. Id., at 424-425. Because neither
"knowingly" nor any comparable term appears in $ 5861(d), the statute
before us today requires even less proof of knowledge than the dissenters
would have demanded in Liparota.

16 Justice Ginsburg similarly assumes that the character of "all guns"

cannot be said to place upon defendants an obligation "to inquire about
the need for registration." Ante, at 622 (emphasis added).

17 The Government does note that some Courts of Appeals have required

proof of knowledge only that "the weapon was `a firearm, within the general meaning of that term,' " Brief for United States 24-25 (citing cases).
Contrary to the assertion by the Court, ante, at 632, n. 5, however, the
Government does not advance this test as the appropriate knowledge requirement, but instead supports the one used by other Courts of Appeals.
Compare the Court's description of the Government's position, ibid., with
the following statements in the Government's brief:

"A defendant may be convicted of such offenses so long as the government
proves that he knew the item at issue was highly dangerous and of a type
likely to be subject to regulation." Brief for United States 9.

"[T]he court of appeals correctly required the government to prove only
that petitioner knew that he possessed a dangerous weapon likely to be
subject to regulation." Id., at 13.

"B. The intent requirement applicable to Section 5861(d) is knowledge that
one is dealing with a dangerous item of a type likely to be subject to
regulation." Id., at 16.

substance--and especially where it penalizes a failure to act or to comply

Thus, even assuming that the Court is correct that the
mere possession of an ordinary rifle or pistol does not entail
sufficient danger to alert one to the possibility of regulation,
that conclusion does not resolve this case. Petitioner knowingly possessed a semiautomatic weapon that was readily
convertible into a machinegun. The " `character and nature' " of such a weapon is sufficiently hazardous to place the
possessor on notice of the possibility of regulation. See
Posters `N' Things, Ltd. v. United States, ante, at 525 (citation omitted).18 No significant difference exists between

ing with such a substance and that it was likely to be subject to regulation
provides sufficient intent to support a conviction." Id., at 17-18.

"Rather, absent contrary congressional direction, knowledge of the highly
dangerous nature of the articles involved and the likelihood that they are
subject to regulation takes the place of the more rigorous knowledge requirement applicable where apparently innocent and harmless devices are
subject to regulation." Id., at 20.

"But the instruction did not require the government to prove that petitioner knew his weapon `possess[ed] every last characteristic [which subjects it] to regulation'; he need only have `know[n] that he [was] dealing
with a dangerous device of a type as would alert one to the likelihood of
regulation.' Tr. 465.

"That instruction accurately describes the mental state necessary for a
violation of Section 5861(d)." Id., at 23.

"[P]roof that a defendant was on fair notice that the item he possessed
was highly dangerous and likely to be regulated is sufficient to support a
conviction." Id., at 24.

18 The Court and Justice Ginsburg apparently assume that the outer

limits of any such notice can be no broader than the category of dangerous
objects that Congress delineated as "firearms." Ante, at 611-612; ante,
at 621-622. Our holding in Posters `N' Things, illustrates the error in
that assumption. A retailer who may not know whether certain merchandise is actually drug paraphernalia, as that term is defined in the relevant
federal statute, may nevertheless violate the law if "aware that customers
in general are likely to use the merchandise with drugs." Ante, at 524.
The owner of a semiautomatic weapon that is readily convertible into a
machinegun can certainly be aware of its dangerous nature and the consequent probability of regulation even if he does not know whether the

imposing upon the possessor a duty to determine whethersuch a weapon is registered, Freed, 401 U. S., at 607-610, and

imposing a duty to determine whether that weapon has beenconverted into a machinegun.

Cases arise, of course, in which a defendant would notknow that a device was dangerous unless he knew that it
was a "firearm" as defined in the Act. Freed was such acase; unless the defendant knew that the device in question
was a hand grenade, he would not necessarily have knownthat it was dangerous. But given the text and nature of
the statute, it would be utterly implausible to suggest thatCongress intended the owner of a sawed-off shotgun to be
criminally liable if he knew its barrel was 17.5 inches longbut not if he mistakenly believed the same gun had an 18-
inch barrel. Yet the Court's holding today assumes thatCongress intended that bizarre result.

The enforcement of public welfare offenses always entailssome possibility of injustice. Congress nevertheless has repeatedly decided that an overriding public interest in healthor safety may outweigh that risk when a person is dealing
with products that are sufficiently dangerous or deleteriousto make it reasonable to presume that he either knows, or
should know, whether those products conform to special reg-ulatory requirements. The dangerous character of the product is reasonably presumed to provide sufficient notice of theprobability of regulation to justify strict enforcement against
those who are merely guilty of negligent, rather than will-ful, misconduct.

The National Firearms Act is within the category of publicwelfare statutes enacted by Congress to regulate highly dangerous items. The Government submits that a convictionunder such a statute may be supported by proof that the

weapon is actually a machinegun. If ignorance of the precise characteristics that render an item forbidden should be a defense, items that are
likely to be "drug paraphernalia" are no more obviously dangerous, and
thus regulated, than items that are likely to be "firearms."

The history and interpretation of the National Firearms
Act supports the conclusion that Congress did not intend to

19 As a matter of law, this is the level of knowledge required by the
statute. Therefore, contrary to the Court's suggestion, ante, at 612,
n. 6, I have not left the determination of the "exact content of the knowledge requirement" to the jury. I only leave to the jury its usual function:
the application of this legal standard to the facts. In performing this
function, juries are frequently required to determine if a law has been
violated by application of just such a "general `standard.' " See, e. g.,
Posters `N' Things, ante, at 523-525; Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15,
24 (1973).

20 The Court also supports its conclusion on the basis of the purported

disparity between the penalty provided by this statute and those of other
regulatory offenses. Although a modest penalty may indicate that a
crime is a public welfare offense, such a penalty is not a requisite characteristic of public welfare offenses. For example, the crime involved in
Balint involved punishment of up to five years' imprisonment. See Dotterweich, 320 U. S., at 285; see also Morissette, 342 U. S., at 251, n. 8 (noting that rape of one too young to consent is an offense "in which the
victim's actual age was determinative despite defendant's reasonable belief
that the girl had reached age of consent"). Moreover, congressional authorization of a range of penalties in some cases--petitioner, for instance,
is on probation--demonstrates a recognition that relatively innocent conduct should be punished less severely.

require knowledge of all the facts that constitute the offense
of possession of an unregistered weapon. During the first
30 years of enforcement of the 1934 Act, consistent with the
absence of a knowledge requirement and with the reasoning
in Balint, courts uniformly construed it not to require knowledge of all the characteristics of the weapon that brought it
within the statute. In a case decided in 1963, then-Judge
Blackmun reviewed the earlier cases and concluded that
the defendant's knowledge that he possessed a gun was "all
the scienter which the statute requires." Sipes v. United
States, 321 F. 2d 174, 179 (CA8), cert. denied, 375 U. S. 913
(1963).

Congress subsequently amended the statute twice, once in
1968 and again in 1986. Both amendments added knowledge
requirements to other portions of the Act,21 but neither the
text nor the history of either amendment discloses an intent
to add any other knowledge requirement to the possession
of an unregistered firearm offense. Given that, with only
one partial exception,22 every federal tribunal to address the
question had concluded that proof of knowledge of all the
facts constituting a violation was not required for a convic21 Significantly, in 1968, Congress included a knowledge requirement in

the making of, a false entry on any application, return, or record required
by this chapter, knowing such entry to be false") (emphasis added).
"[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute
but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed
that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion
or exclusion." Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U. S. 522, 525 (1987) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see also Lawrence County v.

the view of the majority today. See United States v. Williams, 872 F. 2d

tion under $ 5861(d),23 we may infer that Congress intendedthat interpretation to survive. See Lorillard v. Pons, 434

U. S. 575, 580 (1978).In short, petitioner's knowledge that he possessed an item
that was sufficiently dangerous to alert him to the likelihoodof regulation would have supported a conviction during the
first half century of enforcement of this statute. Unless ap-plication of that standard to a particular case violates the
Due Process Clause,24 it is the responsibility of Congress, notthis Court, to amend the statute if Congress deems it unfair
or unduly strict. IV

On the premise that the purpose of the mens rea requirement is to avoid punishing people "for apparently innocentactivity,"

Justice Ginsburg concludes that proof of knowledge that a weapon is " `a dangerous device of a type aswould alert one to the likelihood of regulation' " is not an

adequate mens rea requirement, but that proof of knowledgethat the weapon possesses " `every last characteristic' " that
subjects it to regulation is. Ante, at 622-623, and n. 5
(Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting the trialcourt's jury instruction).

And, as I have already noted, United States v. Freed, 401 U. S. 601
(1971), was consistent with the Government's position here. Although the
Government accepted the burden of proving that Freed knew that the
item he possessed was a hand grenade, the possessor of an unfamiliar
object such as a hand grenade would not know that it was "a dangerous
item of a type likely to be subject to regulation," Brief for United States
16; see also id., at 20, 23, 24, unless he knew what it was.

638 STAPLES v. UNITED STATES

Stevens, J., dissenting
Assuming that "innocent activity" describes conduct with-out any consciousness of wrongdoing, the risk of punishing

such activity can be avoided only by reading into the statutethe common-law concept of

mens rea: "an evil purpose or
mental culpability." Morissette, 342 U. S., at 252.25 Buteven petitioner does not contend that the Government must

prove guilty intent or intentional wrongdoing. Instead, the
"mens rea" issue in this case is simply what knowledge re-quirement, if any, Congress implicitly included in this offense. There are at least five such possible knowledge re-quirements, four of which entail the risk that a completely
innocent mistake will subject a defendant to punishment.First, a defendant may know that he possesses a weapon
with all of the characteristics that make it a "firearm" withinthe meaning of the statute and also know that it has never
been registered, but be ignorant of the federal registration
requirement. In such a case, we presume knowledge of the
law even if we know the defendant is "innocent" in the sense
that Justice Ginsburg uses the word. Second, a defendant may know that he possesses a weapon with all of the
characteristics of a statutory firearm and also know that the
law requires that it be registered, but mistakenly believe
that it is in fact registered. Freed squarely holds that this
defendant's "innocence" is not a defense. Third, a defendant

25 Our use of the term mens rea has not been consistent. In Morissette,
we used the term as if it always connoted a form of wrongful intent. In
other cases, we employ it simply to mean whatever level of knowledge
is required for any particular crime. See, e. g., United States v. Bailey,
444 U. S. 394, 403 (1980). In this sense, every crime except a true strictliability offense contains a mens rea requirement. For instance, the
Court defined mens rea in Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S., at 426, as
"knowledge of illegality." In dissent, however, Justice White equated the
term with knowledge of the facts that make the conduct illegal. Id., at
442-443. Today, the Court assigns the term the latter definition, ante,
at 605, but in fact requires proof of knowledge of only some of the facts
that constitute the violation, ante, at 609 (not requiring proof of knowledge
of the fact that the gun is unregistered).

may know only that he possesses a weapon with all of thecharacteristics of a statutory firearm. Neither ignorance of

the registration requirement nor ignorance of the fact thatthe weapon is unregistered protects this "innocent" defendant. Fourth, a defendant may know that he possesses aweapon that is sufficiently dangerous to likely be regulated,
but not know that it has all the characteristics of a statutoryfirearm. Petitioner asserts that he is an example of this
"innocent" defendant. Fifth, a defendant may know thathe possesses an ordinary gun and, being aware of the widespread lawful gun ownership in the country, reasonably as-sume that there is no need "to inquire about the need for
registration." Ante, at 622 (Ginsburg, J., concurring injudgment). That, of course, is not this case. See supra, at
624, and n. 1.26

Justice Ginsburg treats the first, second, and third alter-natives differently from the fourth and fifth. Her acceptance of knowledge of the characteristics of a statutory "fire-arm" as a sufficient predicate for criminal liability--despite
ignorance of either the duty to register or the fact of nonreg-istration, or both--must rest on the premise that such knowledge would alert the owner to the likelihood of regulation,thereby depriving the conduct of its "apparen[t] innocen[ce]."
Yet in the fourth alternative, a jury determines just suchknowledge: that the characteristics of the weapon known to
the defendant would alert the owner to the likelihood ofregulation.

In short, Justice Ginsburg's reliance on "the purpose ofthe mens rea requirement--to shield people against punishment for apparently innocent activity," ante, at 622, neitherexplains why ignorance of certain facts is a defense although

26 Although I disagree with the assumption that "widespread lawful gun
ownership" provides a sufficient reason for believing that there is no need
to register guns (there is also widespread lawful automobile ownership),
acceptance of that assumption neither justifies the majority's holding nor
contradicts my conclusion on the facts of this case.

V
This case presents no dispute about the dangerous charac-ter of machineguns and sawed-off shotguns. Anyone in possession of such a weapon is "standing in responsible relationto a public danger." See

Dotterweich, 320 U. S., at 281 (cita-tion omitted). In the National Firearms Act, Congress determined that the serious threat to health and safety posedby the private ownership of such firearms warranted the imposition of a duty on the owners of dangerous weapons todetermine whether their possession is lawful. Semiautomatic weapons that are readily convertible into machinegunsare sufficiently dangerous to alert persons who knowingly
possess them to the probability of stringent public regula-tion. The jury's finding that petitioner knowingly possessed
"a dangerous device of a type as would alert one to the likeli-hood of regulation" adequately supports the conviction.

Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court ofAppeals.

27 In addition, contrary to Justice Ginsburg's assumption, if one reads
the term "firearm" from the quoted section of the indictment to mean
"gun," the indictment still charges an offense under $ 5861(d) and does not
differ from the critical jury instruction. See ante, at 622-623. Even if
Justice Ginsburg is correct that there is a technical variance, petitioner
makes no claim that any such variance prejudiced him. The wording of
the indictment, of course, sheds no light on the proper interpretation of
the underlying statutory text. Although the repeated use of a term in a
statute may shed light on the statute's construction, see Ratzlaf v. United
States, 510 U. S. 135, 143 (1994), such use in an indictment is irrelevant to
that question.

ASSOCIATED INDUSTRIES OF MISSOURI et al. v.LOHMAN, DIRECTOR OF REVENUE OF MISSOURI,

et al.
certiorari to the supreme court of missouri

No. 93-397. Argued March 28, 1994--Decided May 23, 1994
Missouri's uniform, statewide "additional use tax" on goods purchased outside the State and stored, used, or consumed within the State is purportedly designed to "compensate" for the taxes imposed by local jurisdictions within the State on in-state sales of goods. Local sales tax rates,
however, vary widely, and in many jurisdictions the use tax exceeds
the sales tax. Petitioners--a trade association representing businesses
that must collect the additional use tax and a manufacturer that pays
it--brought this action in state court, contending that the tax scheme
impermissibly discriminates against interstate commerce in violation of
the Commerce Clause. The State Circuit Court granted respondents
summary judgment. In affirming, the Supreme Court of Missouri reasoned that, because the tax was designed to even exactions on intrastate
and interstate trade, the tax scheme should be analyzed under the "compensatory tax" doctrine. The court concluded that, given the high average rate of local jurisdictions' sales taxes, the overall effect of the use
tax scheme across the State was to place a lighter aggregate tax burden
on interstate commerce than on intrastate commerce, even though in
some localities the use tax might exceed the sales tax. The court determined that, in such circumstances, there was no discrimination against
interstate commerce on a statewide basis and held that the use tax
scheme did not violate the Commerce Clause.

Held: Missouri's use tax scheme impermissibly discriminates against interstate commerce in those localities where the use tax exceeds the
sales tax. Pp. 646-657.

(a) Although the compensatory tax doctrine saves from constitutional
infirmity a facially discriminatory tax that imposes on interstate commerce the equivalent of an "identifiable and substantially similar tax on
intrastate commerce," Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of
Environmental Quality of Ore., ante, at 103, Missouri's use tax scheme
runs afoul of the basic requirement that, for a tax system to be "compensatory," the burdens imposed on interstate and intrastate commerce
must be equal, see, e. g., Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., 300 U. S. 577,
584-587. Whether the use tax is equal to (or lower than) the local sales
tax is a matter of fortuity in Missouri, depending entirely on the locality

in which the Missouri purchaser happens to reside. In jurisdictions
where the use tax exceeds the sales tax, the discrepancy imposes a
discriminatory burden on interstate commerce. The State Supreme
Court's statewide averaging approach is contrary to this Court's decisions, which have, for example, implicitly rejected any theory that would
require aggregating the burdens on commerce across an entire State to
determine the constitutionality of an exaction imposed on interstate
trade by a particular political subdivision. See Fort Gratiot Sanitary
Landfill, Inc. v. Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, 504 U. S. 353,
363. General American Tank Car Corp. v. Day, 270 U. S. 367, 373, distinguished. Requiring equal treatment of intrastate and interstate
commerce not only across the State as a whole, but also within each
political subdivision of the State, does not effectively eliminate the
State's ability to delegate taxing authority to local jurisdictions. It
merely prohibits the State from granting its subdivisions a power to
discriminate that the State lacked in the first instance. Pp. 646-654.

(b) The Court rejects petitioners' contention that the use tax should
be struck down in its entirety. Petitioners argue that the tax should
be treated as facially invalid in every jurisdiction because there is no
countervailing statewide sales tax and no legislation ensuring that local
sales taxes will always equal or exceed the use tax. But it is the actual
discrimination that results from the Missouri tax system in some localities, not the potential for discrimination in every locality, that transgresses constitutional commands. See, e. g., Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query,
286 U. S. 472, 481. Pp. 654-656.

(c) The effect that any predeprivation procedures provided under
state law for contesting the use tax might have on the appropriate remedy in this case, as well as determination of the methods best adapted
to implementing a remedy here, are matters best left for consideration
on remand. Pp. 656-657.

Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
The State of Missouri imposes a uniform, statewide usetax on all goods purchased outside the State and stored,

used, or consumed within the State. Although the tax ispurportedly designed to "compensate" for sales taxes imposed by local jurisdictions on sales of goods in the State,local sales tax rates vary widely, and in many jurisdictions
the use tax exceeds the sales tax. Petitioners contend thatthis system discriminates against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause, even though the local salestaxes across the State may, in the aggregate, place a greater
burden on intrastate trade than the uniform use tax placeson interstate trade. We agree that, in localities where the
use tax exceeds the sales tax, the system is impermissiblydiscriminatory, and we therefore reverse the judgment of the
Supreme Court of Missouri.

Missouri has a multitiered system of sales and use taxes.The State imposes by statute a tax of 4% on all sales of

personal property in the State, Mo. Rev. Stat. $ 144.020(1986), and, through provisions in the State Constitution,

one-tenth of one percent, respectively, on the "privilege ofstoring, using or consuming" within the State any article of

Thus, under these various provisions, the State imposes astatewide sales tax of 4.225% on sales of goods within the

State and a statewide use tax of 4.225% on goods broughtinto the State after being purchased elsewhere. These
taxes are not challenged here.The State also imposes an "additional use tax" of 1.5% on
the privilege of storing, using, or consuming within the Stateany article of personal property purchased outside the State.
Mo. Rev. Stat. $ 144.748 (Supp. 1993).2 This use tax is notpaired with any sales tax at the state level. The State,
however, authorizes political subdivisions, including counties
and incorporated municipalities, to impose a local sales tax.3

use tax on sales made into the State. Petitioner AlumaxFoils, Inc., is a manufacturing firm in Missouri that pays

the additional use tax on goods purchased from outside theState. Petitioners brought this action in state court contending that the use tax impermissibly discriminates against
interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause.The State Circuit Court rejected petitioners' claims and

granted respondents' motion for summary judgment.The Supreme Court of Missouri affirmed. 857 S. W. 2d
182 (1993). The court noted that the 1.5% use tax had beenimposed to equalize taxes on in-state and out-of-state goods.
Previously, political subdivisions of the State had imposed
local sales tax burdens that were not paralleled by any use
tax. Because the tax was designed to even exactions on
intrastate and interstate trade, the court reasoned that the
scheme should be analyzed under the "compensatory tax"
doctrine, which the court summarized as permitting States
to "impose . . . equivalent burden[s]" on transactions in local
and interstate commerce. Id., at 187.

The court acknowledged that, in 53.5% of local taxing
jurisdictions, the 1.5% use tax exceeded the local sales tax.
See id., at 185, n. 3. But the court emphasized that 1990
sales figures from the stipulated record showed that over
93% of the dollar volume of sales in the State occurred in
jurisdictions where the local sales tax exceeded the use tax.
See id., at 185. Calculating from similar figures, the court
determined that, had a flat local sales tax of 1.5%--exactly
equivalent to the use tax--been imposed in 1990, it would
have reduced the sales tax burden on in-state sales by $100
million. Ibid. In short, the court concluded that given the
high average rate of local sales taxes, the overall effect of
the use tax scheme across the State was to place a lighter
aggregate tax burden on interstate commerce than on intrastate commerce.

After rehearsing these facts, the court stated the issue
before it as being whether "a state use tax may impose a

Opinion of the Court
greater burden than the various sales taxes in specific locali-ties, if on a statewide basis the use tax imposes a lesser overall burden than do all the various sales taxes." Id., at 186.Relying on this Court's decision in General American Tank
Car Corp. v. Day, 270 U. S. 367 (1926), the court answeredthat question in the affirmative. The court reasoned that
whether the tax scheme discriminated against interstatecommerce should be determined on the basis of a comparison
of the overall effects of the use tax and the local sales taxeson interstate commerce statewide. Because the figures outlined above suggested that, in the aggregate, the tax schemeimposed greater burdens on intrastate than on interstate
commerce, the court concluded that the tax avoided discrimi-nation on a statewide basis and thus did not violate the dictates of the Commerce Clause. 857 S. W. 2d, at 187-192.In dissent, then-Chief Justice Robertson criticized the
court's focus on averaging effects across the State to deter-mine whether there was discrimination and suggested that
the majority's method was tantamount to basing constitu-tional analysis on a conclusion that the use tax scheme was
" `close enough for government work.' " Id., at 195. ChiefJustice Robertson concluded that this Court's cases contained a strict rule of equality that demanded equal treat-ment of local and interstate commerce in each local jurisdiction, not merely in the overall result for the State. Id.,at 199.

We granted certiorari, 510 U. S. 1009 (1993), to considerthe validity of the 1.5% use tax.

II
Although the Commerce Clause is phrased merely as agrant of authority to Congress to "regulate Commerce . . .

among the several States," Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3, it is well estab-lished that the Clause also embodies a negative command
forbidding the States to discriminate against interstatetrade. See, e. g., Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department

of Environmental Quality of Ore., ante, at 98; New EnergyCo. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 273 (1988). The Clause

prohibits economic protectionism--that is, "regulatory meas-ures designed to benefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors." Id., at 273-274. Thus,we have characterized the fundamental command of the
Clause as being that "a State may not tax a transaction orincident more heavily when it crosses state lines than when
it occurs entirely within the State," Armco Inc. v. Hardesty,467 U. S. 638, 642 (1984), and have applied a "virtually

per serule of invalidity" to provisions that patently discriminate

against interstate trade, Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437U. S. 617, 624 (1978).

A
By its terms, the additional use tax at issue in this caseappears to violate the Commerce Clause's cardinal rule of

nondiscrimination, for it exempts from its scope all sales ofgoods occurring within the State. See n. 2, supra. Nevertheless, our cases establish that such a levy may be savedfrom constitutional infirmity if it is a valid "compensatory
tax" designed simply to make interstate commerce bear aburden already borne by intrastate commerce. Under the
compensatory tax doctrine, a facially discriminatory tax thatimposes on interstate commerce the equivalent of an "identifiable and substantially similar tax on intrastate commercedoes not offend the negative Commerce Clause."

OregonWaste, ante, at 103 (internal quotation marks omitted). To

ensure that the State is indeed merely imposing countervail-ing burdens on comparable transactions, we have required
that the taxes on interstate and intrastate commerce be im-posed on "substantially equivalent event[s]."

Maryland v.Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 759 (1981). See also Armco,

supra, at 643. The end result under the theory of the com-pensatory tax is that, "[w]hen the account is made up, the
stranger from afar is subject to no greater burdens . . . thanthe dweller within the gates. The one pays upon one activ511us2$56N 11-03-97 22:25:51 PAGES OPINPGT

Henneford v. Silas
Mason Co., 300 U. S. 577, 584 (1937).To justify any levy as a compensatory tax, "a State must,

as a threshold matter, `identif[y] . . . the [intrastate tax]
burden for which the State is attempting to compensate.' "
Oregon Waste, ante, at 103 (quoting Maryland, supra, at
758). Respondents urge that the local sales taxes imposedby over a thousand political subdivisions within the State

provide the burden on intrastate commerce that Missouriseeks to counterbalance through the use tax in this case.
There is no dispute that sales taxes and use taxes such as
those at issue here are imposed on "substantially equivalent
event[s]." Maryland, supra, at 759. Silas Mason itself
approved a system of sales and use taxes, and we have recognized that "[a] use tax is generally perceived as a necessary
complement to [a] sales tax." Williams v. Vermont, 472
U. S. 14, 24 (1985). Cf. Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co.
v. Reily, 373 U. S. 64, 66 (1963) ("[T]he purpose of such a
sales-use tax scheme is to make all tangible property used
or consumed in the State subject to a uniform tax burden
irrespective of whether it is acquired within the State . . . or
from without the State").

Missouri's use tax scheme, however, runs afoul of the basic
requirement that, for a tax system to be "compensatory," the
burdens imposed on interstate and intrastate commerce
must be equal. As we observed in Maryland v. Louisiana,
the "common thread running through the cases upholding
compensatory taxes is the equality of treatment between
local and interstate commerce." 451 U. S., at 759. See also
Halliburton, supra, at 70 ("[E]qual treatment for in-state
and out-of-state taxpayers similarly situated is the condition
precedent for a valid use tax on goods imported from out-ofstate"). Where a State imposes equivalent sales and use
taxes, we have upheld the system under the Commerce
Clause. See Silas Mason, supra, at 584-587. But in Mis511US2 Unit: $U56 [11-05-99 11:37:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
souri, whether the 1.5% use tax is equal to (or lower than)the local sales tax is a matter of fortuity, depending entirely

upon the locality in which the Missouri purchaser happens toreside. Where the use tax exceeds the sales tax, the discrepancy imposes a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce. Out-of-state goods brought into such a jurisdictionare subjected to a higher levy than are goods sold locally.

The resulting disparity is incompatible with what we havetermed the "strict rule of equality adopted in

Silas Mason."
Halliburton, supra, at 73.Respondents contend that the foregoing analysis is too myopic--that in reckoning the balance of accounts alluded to in
Silas Mason we should focus, not on each political subdivision in which a disparity between the two taxes may result
in discrimination against interstate commerce, but rather on
the overall impact of the use tax and the various sales taxes on
interstate commerce across the State as a whole. Respondents' theory assumes that discrimination in some parts of a
state tax system may be permissible under the Commerce
Clause as long as it is of a sufficiently limited magnitude to
be offset by preferential treatment for interstate trade in
other portions of the tax scheme. There is no question that,
within a locality where the use tax exceeds the sales tax, the
tax structure discriminates against interstate trade. Respondents merely argue that the local jurisdiction provides
too narrow a framework for proper constitutional analysis.

We have never suggested, however, that patent discrimination in part of the operation of a tax scheme, not directly
justified under any theory such as the compensatory tax doctrine, can be rendered inconsequential for Commerce Clause
purposes by advantages given to interstate commerce in
other facets of a tax plan or in other regions of a State. On
the contrary, as a general matter we have rejected reliance
on any calculus that requires a quantification of discrimination as a preliminary step to determining whether the discrimination is valid. Under our cases, unless one of several

511us2$56N 11-03-97 22:25:51 PAGES OPINPGT
650 ASSOCIATED INDUSTRIES OF MO. v. LOHMAN

Opinion of the Court
narrow bases of justification is shown, see Oregon Waste,
ante, at 100-101, actual discrimination, wherever it is found,
is impermissible, and the magnitude and scope of the dis-crimination have no bearing on the determinative question

whether discrimination has occurred. See Wyoming v.
Oklahoma, 502 U. S. 437, 454-455 (1992); New Energy Co.,486 U. S., at 276;

Maryland, supra, at 760.
Moreover, two Terms ago we implicitly rejected any the-ory that would require aggregating the burdens on commerce across an entire State to determine the constitutional-ity of a burden on interstate trade imposed by a particular
political subdivision of the State. We concluded that proper
analysis of the practice of one county that discriminated
against interstate trade was "unaffected by the fact that
some other counties [in the State] ha[d] adopted a different
policy." Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Michigan
Dept. of Natural Resources, 504 U. S. 353, 363 (1992). Contrary to respondents' suggestions, our reasoning indicates
that discrimination is appropriately assessed with reference
to the specific subdivision in which applicable laws reveal
differential treatment.

Any other approach would frustrate the Commerce
Clause's central objective of securing a national " `area of
free trade among the several States.' " Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm'n, 429 U. S. 318, 328 (1977) (quoting McLeod v. J. E. Dilworth Co., 322 U. S. 327, 330 (1944)).
Under respondents' view, the Commerce Clause would interpose no bar to the systematic subdivision of the national market through discriminatory taxes as long as the taxes were
imposed by counties, rather than by States--and provided,
of course, that on balance each State as a whole did not
discriminate against interstate trade. Such a rule "would
invite a multiplication of preferential trade areas destructive
of the very purpose of the Commerce Clause." Dean Milk
Co. v. Madison, 340 U. S. 349, 356 (1951). We have never
suggested that the Commerce Clause will tolerate such dis511us2$56N 11-03-97 22:25:51 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
crimination. Rather, "our prior cases teach that a State (orone of its political subdivisions) may not avoid the strictures

of the Commerce Clause by curtailing the movement ofarticles of commerce through subdivisions of the State,
rather than through the State itself." Fort Gratiot, supra,
at 361.Respondents contend that their proposed method of assessing discrimination on a statewide basis also finds supportin our cases and, following the Supreme Court of Missouri,
rely on our decision in General American Tank Car Corp.v.

Day, 270 U. S. 367 (1926). General American involved a
challenge to a Louisiana property tax scheme under which
nondomiciliaries of the State were taxed at a rate of 25 mills
on the dollar, while domiciliaries were taxed at a rate determined by their parish of domicile. See id., at 370-371.
Even though some parish tax rates were less than 25 mills
on the dollar, the Court did not strike down the tax. The
decision, however, does not provide controlling Commerce
Clause analysis for this case.

Although General American involved both Commerce
Clause and Equal Protection Clause challenges, it was only
in analyzing the tax in question under the Equal Protection
Clause that we engaged in the aggregating analysis respondents urge on us under the Commerce Clause today. Noting
that, considered together, the parish taxes "average[d] approximately twenty-five mills," we concluded that "in substance" the scheme did not discriminate against nondomiciliaries and that it was not "invalid merely because equality in
its operation as compared with local taxation has not been
attained with mathematical exactness." Id., at 373. We
reasoned that, "[i]n determining whether there is a denial of
equal protection of the laws by such taxation, we must look
to the fairness and reasonableness of its purposes and practical operation, rather than to minute differences between its
application in practice and the application of the taxing statute or statutes to which it is complementary." Ibid.

652 ASSOCIATED INDUSTRIES OF MO. v. LOHMAN

Opinion of the Court
It might be argued that the assessment of equal treatmentin General American was a final step in the Court's Commerce Clause analysis as well, for the discussion followedupon the conclusion that the Louisiana scheme survived
Commerce Clause scrutiny "unless it operate[d] to discrimi-nate in some substantial way between" domiciliaries and
nondomiciliaries. Id., at 372. But even if that were so, the
General American approach to averaging burdens on inter-state and intrastate commerce, which Chief Justice Robertson aptly characterized as a rule of " `close enough for gov-ernment work,' " 857 S. W. 2d, at 195, never took root in our
Commerce Clause jurisprudence. To the extent that General American's Equal Protection Clause discussion evercould have been read as suggesting appropriate Commerce

Clause analysis, it has been bypassed by later decisions, andparticularly by the "strict rule of equality adopted in Silas
Mason," Halliburton, 373 U. S., at 73, a rule that has con-trolled compensatory tax cases for over half a century. In
Silas Mason, Justice Cardozo was explicit in explaining forthe Court that the compensatory tax doctrine requires precision to ensure that, upon the "reckoning" of "account[s]," the
"sum" on the interstate side of the ledger is "the same" asthat on the intrastate side. 300 U. S., at 584. More recently, we have reiterated that strict parity is demanded bythe compensatory tax doctrine as we have explained that a
compensatory tax leaves a consumer free to make choices"without regard to the tax consequences"; if he purchases
within the State he may pay a tax, but if he purchases from
outside the State he will pay a "tax of the same amount."
Boston Stock Exchange, supra, at 332 (emphasis added).4

4 Of course, in focusing on equality, our cases have addressed the limit
of permissible state regulation of interstate commerce. In setting the
limit at equality, we have not suggested that lesser burdens on interstate
trade are impermissible; that is, we have not demanded equality and nothing but equality in compensatory tax cases.

Opinion of the Court
Respondents' final defense of the use tax is an appeal
to Missouri's pure motives: that is, its lack of any intent to
discriminate. As the product of a decentralized decisionmaking process that relies on the independent judgment of
hundreds of local jurisdictions, the use tax scheme, in respondents' view, cannot reveal any overall design on the part
of the State or any other governmental entity to disfavor
interstate trade. In fact, respondents urge that holding
this scheme unconstitutional would effectively eliminate the
State's ability to delegate taxing authority to local jurisdictions. But a court need not inquire into the purpose or
motivation behind a law to determine that in actuality it
impermissibly discriminates against interstate commerce.
See, e. g., Philadelphia, 437 U. S., at 626 (describing "legislative purpose" as "not . . . relevant to the constitutional
issue to be decided"); Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333, 352-353 (1977). See also
Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v. Hunt, 504 U. S. 334,
340-342 (1992).

It should be apparent that in holding this scheme unconstitutional we impose no new restrictions on the State's power
to delegate its taxing authority as it sees fit. What a State
may not do is appeal to decentralized decisionmaking to augment its powers: It may not grant its political subdivisions
a power to discriminate against interstate commerce that
the State lacked in the first instance.

The State remains free to authorize political subdivisions
to impose sales or use taxes, as long as discriminatory treatment of interstate commerce does not result. Other States
apparently have had little difficulty in combining some local
autonomy with the commands of the Commerce Clause. As
the parties stipulated, App. 35, 28 States that provide political subdivisions some authority to impose use taxes have devised systems to ensure that use taxes are not higher than
sales taxes within the same taxing jurisdiction. See, e. g.,

Opinion of the Court
Ga. Code Ann. $ 48-8-110 (Supp. 1994) (requiring the enactment of a local use tax to be coupled with the adoption of an
equivalent sales tax).

B

As our discussion above makes clear, Missouri's use tax
scheme impermissibly discriminates against interstate commerce only in those localities where the local sales tax is
less than 1.5%. Apparently hoping to obtain a refund for all
moneys paid under the use tax, however, petitioners seek to
have the tax struck down in its entirety. They urge us to
hold that the tax is facially invalid in every jurisdiction because there is no countervailing statewide sales tax and no
legislation ensuring that local sales taxes will always equal
or exceed the use tax. The evil of the system, under this
view, is not merely the actual discrimination that results in
some localities, but the potential for discrimination in every
locality. Indeed, the logic of petitioners' theory suggests
that the potential for abuse would make Missouri's use tax
scheme impermissibly discriminatory even if every political
subdivision had chosen to impose a sales tax of greater
than 1.5%.

But we have never deemed a hypothetical possibility of
favoritism to constitute discrimination that transgresses
constitutional commands. On the contrary, we repeatedly
have focused our Commerce Clause analysis on whether a
challenged scheme is discriminatory in "effect," see, e. g.,
Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263, 270 (1984), and
we have emphasized that "equality for the purposes of . . .
the flow of commerce is measured in dollars and cents, not
legal abstractions." Halliburton, 373 U. S., at 70. See also
Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, 286 U. S. 472, 481 (1932) ("Discrimination, like interstate commerce itself, is a practical
conception. We must deal in this matter, as in others, with
substantial distinctions and real injuries"). A purely nominal distinction in a State's statutes between the methods of

Opinion of the Court
regulating intrastate and interstate commerce, as long as itis not translated into any difference in the substance of regulations imposed, cannot be said to provide "benefit[s]" to in-trastate commerce or to impose discriminatory "burden[s]"
on interstate trade. New Energy, 486 U. S., at 273. Thus,
it would not violate the Commerce Clause.For similar reasons, the mere fact that determining the

compensatory character of the use tax in this case requiresconsideration of the sales taxes levied by hundreds of local
jurisdictions does not mean that the use tax should be re-jected

in toto as facially discriminatory. A compensatory
tax and the tax for which it compensates need not be promul-gated in the same provision of state law, or even through

the same governmental entity, to survive Commerce Clause
scrutiny. Such matters of form do not determine in sub-stance whether the tax merely requires interstate commerce

to "pay its way," Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430
U. S. 274, 281 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted), or
discriminates against interstate trade. "The question of
constitutional validity is not to be determined by artificial
standards. What is required is that state action, whether
through one agency or another, or through one enactment or
more than one, shall be consistent with the restrictions of
the Federal Constitution. There is no demand in that Constitution that the State shall put its requirements in any one
statute. It may distribute them as it sees fit, if the result,
taken in its totality, is within the State's constitutional
power." Gregg Dyeing, supra, at 480. See also Maryland,
451 U. S., at 756; Halliburton, supra, at 69.5 If a State may

the morass of weighing comparative tax burdens," American Trucking
Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U. S. 266, 289 (1987) (internal quotation marks
omitted). But as far as the compensatory tax doctrine is concerned, a
court that is confined to examining the rates specified in statutes, ordinances, or regulations for taxes assessed on "substantially equivalent
event[s]," Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 759 (1981)--even if the

Opinion of the Court
place the provisions perfecting a compensatory tax schemein two or more statutes passed by the state legislature, there

is no logical reason to think that a State's decision to imple-ment its sales/use tax scheme through provisions promulgated at different levels of government within the State
makes the system invalid. C

That we have declared the tax scheme impermissibly discriminatory in some localities does not in itself dictate therelief that the State must provide. As we noted in

McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco,
Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 39-40 (1990),
a "State found to have imposed an impermissibly discriminatory tax retains flexibility in responding to this determination." We have suggested that the provision of a "meaningful opportunity for taxpayers to withhold contested tax
assessments and to challenge their validity in a predeprivation hearing" is itself sufficient to satisfy constitutional concerns. Id., at 38, n. 21. Because the parties have not addressed the procedures that were available in Missouri to
contest the tax, any effect Missouri's procedures might have
on the appropriate remedy in this case is best left for consideration on remand. Even if no such predeprivation procedure existed, the Due Process Clause would demand only
that, "to cure the illegality of the tax as originally imposed,
the State must ultimately collect a tax for the contested
tax period that in no respect impermissibly discriminates
against interstate commerce." Id., at 44, n. 27. The methods best adapted to achieving equal treatment in this case,
whether partial or complete refunds or other measures, are
similarly matters properly left for determination on remand.

inquiry requires examination of hundreds of provisions for political units
within the State--avoids being drawn into an amorphous inquiry that involves balancing incommensurate burdens imposed on disparate activities
throughout the complex structure of a State's tax system.

McKNIGHT v. GENERAL MOTORS CORP.
on petition for writ of certiorari to the unitedstates court of appeals for the seventh circuit

No. 92-1113. Decided May 23, 1994
When the Court of Appeals dismissed petitioner's appeal of the dismissal

of his employment discrimination claim, it also imposed sanctions, finding that the appeal was frivolous in light of controlling Circuit precedent
holding that $ 101 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 does not apply to cases
arising before its enactment.

Held: If sanctions were imposed solely because the retroactivity argument was foreclosed by Circuit precedent, the sanctions order was
improper. While the Court of Appeals correctly rejected petitioner's
argument that $ 101 applies retroactively, see, e. g., Landgraf v. USI
Film Products, ante, p. 244, at the time of his appeal, this Court had
not yet ruled on the question. Filing an appeal was the only way he
could preserve the issue pending a possible favorable decision by this
Court. The retroactivity question had divided the District Courts, and
its answer was not so clear as to make his position frivolous.

Certiorari granted; vacated and remanded.

Per Curiam.
After petitioner appealed the dismissal of his employmentdiscrimination claim, respondent moved for dismissal of the

appeal and for sanctions. Respondent argued that the ap-peal was frivolous in light of controlling decisions of the
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit holding that $ 101of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat. 1071, 42 U. S. C.

$ 1981 (1988 ed., Supp. IV), does not apply to cases arisingbefore its enactment. See

Luddington v. Indiana Bell Tel.
Co., 966 F. 2d 225 (1992); Mozee v. American CommercialMarine Serv. Co., 963 F. 2d 929 (1992). In an order dated

September 30, 1992, the Court of Appeals granted respond-ent's motion, dismissed the appeal, and imposed a $500 sanction on petitioner's attorney.The Court of Appeals correctly rejected petitioner's argument that $ 101 applies retroactively. See Landgraf v. USI

Film Products, ante, p. 244; Rivers v. Roadway Express,Inc., ante, p. 298. However, if the only basis for the order

imposing sanctions on petitioner's attorney was that his ret-roactivity argument was foreclosed by Circuit precedent, the
order was not proper. As petitioner noted in his memoran-dum opposing dismissal and sanctions, this Court had not yet
ruled on the application of $ 101 to pending cases. Filing anappeal was the only way petitioner could preserve the issue
pending a possible favorable decision by this Court. Al-though, as of September 30, 1992, there was no circuit conflict
on the retroactivity question, that question had divided theDistrict Courts and its answer was not so clear as to make
petitioner's position frivolous. See Mozee, supra, at 940-941 (Cudahy, J., dissenting).

Accordingly, the petition for a writ of certiorari is granted,the order imposing sanctions is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

WATERS et al. v. CHURCHILL et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 92-1450. Argued December 1, 1993--Decided May 31, 1994
Petitioners fired respondent Churchill from her nursing job at a public

hospital, allegedly because of statements she made to co-worker
Perkins-Graham during a work break. What Churchill actually said
during the conversation is in dispute. Petitioners' version was based
on interviews with Perkins-Graham and one Ballew, who had overheard
part of the conversation, and indicated that Churchill made disruptive
statements critical of her department and of petitioners. However, in
Churchill's version, which was corroborated by others who had overheard part of the conversation, her speech was largely limited to nondisruptive statements critical of the hospital's "cross-training" policy,
which she believed threatened patient care. Churchill sued under 42
U. S. C. $ 1983, claiming that her speech was protected under Connick
v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138, 142, in which the Court held that the First
Amendment protects a government employee's speech if it is on a matter of public concern and the employee's interest in expressing herself
on this matter is not outweighed by any injury the speech could cause
to the government's interest, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency
of the public services it performs through its employees. The District
Court granted petitioners summary judgment, holding that management could fire Churchill with impunity because neither version of the
conversation was protected under Connick. The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that Churchill's speech, viewed in the light most favorable to her, was on a matter of public concern and was not disruptive,
and that the inquiry must turn on what her speech actually was, as
determined by a jury, not on what the employer thought it was.

Held: The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded.
977 F. 2d 1114, vacated and remanded.

Justice O'Connor, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Souter,
and Justice Ginsburg, concluded:

1. The Connick test should be applied to what the government employer reasonably thought was said, not to what the trier of fact ultimately determines to have been said. Pp. 668-679.

(a) Absent a general test for deciding when the First Amendment
requires a procedural safeguard, the question must be answered on a
case-by-case basis, by considering the procedure's cost and the relative

662 WATERS v. CHURCHILL

Syllabus
magnitude and constitutional significance of the risks of erroneous punishment of protected speech and of erroneous exculpation of unprotected
speech that the procedure involves. In evaluating these factors here,
the key is the government employer's interest in achieving its goals as
effectively and efficiently as possible. Pp. 668-675.

(b) The Court of Appeals' approach gives insufficient weight to this
interest, since it would force the government employer to come to its
factual conclusions through procedures that substantially mirror the evidentiary rules used in court, whereas employment decisions are frequently and properly based on hearsay, past similar conduct, personal
knowledge of people's credibility, and other factors that the judicial process ignores. Pp. 675-677.

(c) On the other hand, courts must not apply the Connick test only
to the facts as the employer thought them to be, without considering
the reasonableness of the employer's conclusions. It is necessary that
the decisionmaker reach its conclusion about what was said in good faith,
rather than as a pretext; but it does not follow that good faith alone is
sufficient under the First Amendment. Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v.
Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, and Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High
School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563, distinguished. P. 677.

(d) Thus, if an employment action is based on what an employee
supposedly said, and a reasonable supervisor would recognize that there
is a substantial likelihood that what was actually said was protected,
the First Amendment requires that the manager proceed with the care
that a reasonable manager would use before making an employment
decision of the sort involved in the particular case. In situations in
which reasonable employers would disagree about who is to be believed,
or how much investigation needs to be done, or how much evidence is
needed to come to a particular conclusion, many different courses of
action will necessarily be reasonable, and only procedures outside the
range of what a reasonable manager would use may be condemned as
unreasonable. Pp. 677-678.

2. Applying the foregoing to this case demonstrates that petitioners must win if they really did believe Perkins-Graham's and Ballew's
story, and fired Churchill because of it. That belief, based on the investigation petitioners conducted, would have been entirely reasonable.
Moreover, as a matter of law, the potential disruptiveness of Churchill's
speech would have rendered it unprotected under the Connick test.
Nonetheless, the District Court erred in granting petitioners summary
judgment, since Churchill has produced enough evidence to create a
material issue of disputed fact about whether she was actually fired
because of disruptive statements, or because of nondisruptive state511us3$59Z 11-08-97 20:06:24 PAGES OPINPGT

Syllabus
ments about cross-training, or because of other statements she may
have made earlier. If either of the latter is so, the court will have to
determine whether the statements in question were protected speech.
Pp. 679-682.

Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas,
concluded that the Court should adhere to its previously stated rule
that a public employer's disciplining of an employee violates the First
Amendment only if it is in retaliation for the employee's speech on a
matter of public concern, see, e. g., Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563, 572, and should
not add to this prohibition a requirement that the employer conduct an
investigation before taking disciplinary action. The plurality's recognition of a broad new First Amendment right to an investigation before
dismissal for speech is unprecedented and unpredictable in its application and consequences. In light of the requirement of a pretext inquiry,
it is also superfluous to the disposition of this case and unnecessary for
the protection of public-employee speech on matters of public concern.
Judicial inquiry into the genuineness of a public employer's asserted
permissible justification for an employment decision--be it unprotected
speech, general insubordination, or laziness--is all that is necessary to
avoid the targeting of "public interest" speech condemned in Pickering.
See, e. g., Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 287.
Churchill's right not to be dismissed in retaliation for her expression
of views on a matter of public concern was not violated, since she
was dismissed for another reason, erroneous though it may have been.

The Chief Justice,

In Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138 (1983), we set forth a
test for determining whether speech by a government em-ployee may, consistently with the First Amendment, serve

as a basis for disciplining or discharging that employee. Inthis case, we decide whether the

Connick test should be
applied to what the government employer thought was said,or to what the trier of fact ultimately determines to have

been said. I

This case arises out of a conversation that respondent
Cheryl Churchill had on January 16, 1987, with Melanie
Perkins-Graham. Both Churchill and Perkins-Graham were
nurses working at McDonough District Hospital; Churchill
was in the obstetrics department, and Perkins-Graham was
considering transferring to that department. The conversation took place at work during a dinner break. Petitioners
heard about it and fired Churchill, allegedly because of it.
There is, however, a dispute about what Churchill actually
said, and therefore about whether petitioners were constitutionally permitted to fire Churchill for her statements.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
The conversation was overheard in part by two othernurses, Mary Lou Ballew and Jean Welty, and by Dr. Thomas

Koch, the clinical head of obstetrics. A few days later, Bal-lew told Cynthia Waters, Churchill's supervisor, about the
incident. According to Ballew, Churchill took " `the cross
trainee into the kitchen for . . . at least 20 minutes to talkabout [Waters] and how bad things are in [obstetrics] in general.' " 977 F. 2d 1114, 1118 (CA7 1992). Ballew said thatChurchill's statements led Perkins-Graham to no longer be
interested in switching to the department. SupplementalApp. of Defendants-Appellees in No. 91-2288 (CA7), p. 60.

Shortly after this, Waters met with Ballew a second time
for confirmation of Ballew's initial report. Ballew said that
Churchill "was knocking the department" and that "in general [Churchill] was saying what a bad place [obstetrics]
is to work." Ballew said she heard Churchill say Waters
"was trying to find reasons to fire her." Ballew also said
Churchill described a patient complaint for which Waters had
supposedly wrongly blamed Churchill. Id., at 67-68.

Waters, together with petitioner Kathleen Davis, the hospital's vice president of nursing, also met with PerkinsGraham, who told them that Churchill "had indeed said
unkind and inappropriate negative things about [Waters]."
Id., at 228. Also, according to Perkins-Graham, Churchill
mentioned a negative evaluation that Waters had given
Churchill, which arose out of an incident in which Waters
had cited Churchill for an insubordinate remark. Ibid.
The evaluation stated that Churchill " `promotes an unpleasant atmosphere and hinders constructive communication and
cooperation,' " 977 F. 2d, at 1118, and " `exhibits negative behavior towards [Waters] and [Waters'] leadership through
her actions and body language' "; the evaluation said Churchill's work was otherwise satisfactory, id., at 1116. Churchill
allegedly told Perkins-Graham that she and Waters had discussed the evaluation, and that Waters "wanted to wipe the
slate clean . . . but [Churchill thought] this wasn't possible."

666 WATERS v. CHURCHILL

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Supplemental App. of Defendants-Appellees in No. 91-2288,at 228. Churchill also allegedly told Perkins-Graham "that

just in general things were not good in OB and hospitaladministration was responsible."

Id., at 229. Churchill
specifically mentioned Davis, saying Davis "was ruining
MDH." Ibid. Perkins-Graham told Waters that she knewDavis and Waters "could not tolerate that kind of negativism." Ibid.Churchill's version of the conversation is different. For
several months, Churchill had been concerned about the hos-pital's "cross-training" policy, under which nurses from one
department could work in another when their usual location
was overstaffed. Churchill believed this policy threatened
patient care because it was designed not to train nurses but
to cover staff shortages, and she had complained about this
to Davis and Waters. According to Churchill, the conversation with Perkins-Graham primarily concerned the crosstraining policy. 977 F. 2d, at 1118. Churchill denies that
she said some of what Ballew and Perkins-Graham allege
she said. She does admit she criticized Davis, saying
her staffing policies threatened to "ruin" the hospital because they " `seemed to be impeding nursing care.' " Ibid.
She claims she actually defended Waters and encouraged
Perkins-Graham to transfer to obstetrics. Ibid.

Koch's and Welty's recollections of the conversation match
Churchill's. Id., at 1122. Davis and Waters, however,
never talked to Koch or Welty about this, and they did not
talk to Churchill until the time they told her she was fired.
Moreover, Churchill claims, Ballew was biased against
Churchill because of an incident in which Ballew apparently
made an error and Churchill had to cover for her. Brief for
Respondents 9, n. 12.

After she was discharged, Churchill filed an internal grievance. The president of the hospital, petitioner Stephen Hopper, met with Churchill in regard to this and heard her side
of the story. App. to Pet. for Cert. 75-77. He then re511us3$59J 11-08-97 20:06:24 PAGES OPINPGT

viewed Waters' and Davis' written reports of their conversa-tions with Ballew and Perkins-Graham, and had Bernice

Magin, the hospital's vice president of human resources,interview Ballew one more time. Supplemental App. of
Defendants-Appellees in No. 91-2288, at 108, 139-142.
After considering all this, Hopper rejected Churchill'sgrievance.

Churchill then sued under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C.$ 1983, claiming that the firing violated her First Amendment rights because her speech was protected under Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138 (1983). In May 1991, the United
States District Court for the Central District of Illinois
granted summary judgment to petitioners. The court held
that neither version of the conversation was protected under
Connick: Regardless of whose story was accepted, the
speech was not on a matter of public concern, and even if it
was on a matter of public concern, its potential for disruption
nonetheless stripped it of First Amendment protection.
Therefore, the court held, management could fire Churchill
for the conversation with impunity. App. to Pet. for Cert.
45-49.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed. 977 F. 2d 1114 (1992). The court held that
Churchill's speech, viewed in the light most favorable to her,
was protected speech under the Connick test: It was on a
matter of public concern--"the hospital's [alleged] violation
of state nursing regulations as well as the quality and level
of nursing care it provides its patients," id., at 1122--and it
was not disruptive, id., at 1124.

The court also concluded that the inquiry must turn on
what the speech actually was, not on what the employer
thought it was. "If the employer chooses to discharge the
employee without sufficient knowledge of her protected
speech as a result of an inadequate investigation into the
employee's conduct," the court held, "the employer runs the
risk of eventually being required to remedy any wrongdoing

A

There is no dispute in this case about when speech by agovernment employee is protected by the First Amendment:

To be protected, the speech must be on a matter of publicconcern, and the employee's interest in expressing herself on
this matter must not be outweighed by any injury the speechcould cause to " `the interest of the State, as an employer, in
promoting the efficiency of the public services it performsthrough its employees.' " Connick, supra, at 142 (quoting
Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist.205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563, 568 (1968)). It is also agreed

that it is the court's task to apply the Connick test to thefacts. 461 U. S., at 148, n. 7, and 150, n. 10.

The dispute is over how the factual basis for applying thetest--what the speech was, in what tone it was delivered,
what the listener's reactions were, see id., at 151-153--is tobe determined. Should the court apply the

Connick test tothe speech as the government employer found it to be, or

should it ask the jury to determine the facts for itself? TheCourt of Appeals held that the employer's factual conclusions
were irrelevant, and that the jury should engage in its ownfactfinding. Petitioners argue that the employer's factual
conclusions should be dispositive. Respondents take a mid-dle course: They suggest that the court should accept the
employer's factual conclusions, but only if those conclusionswere arrived at reasonably, see Brief for Respondents 39,
something they say did not happen here.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
We agree that it is important to ensure not only that thesubstantive First Amendment standards are sound, but also

that they are applied through reliable procedures. This iswhy we have often held some procedures--a particular allocation of the burden of proof, a particular quantum of proof,
a particular type of appellate review, and so on--to be consti-tutionally required in proceedings that may penalize protected speech. See Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51,58-60 (1965) (government must bear burden of proving that
speech is unprotected); Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513, 526(1958) (same);

Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps, 475
U. S. 767, 775-778 (1986) (libel plaintiff must bear burden of
proving that speech is false); Masson v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc., 501 U. S. 496, 510 (1991) (actual malice must be
proved by clear and convincing evidence); Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 503-511
(1984) (appellate court must make independent judgment
about presence of actual malice).

These cases establish a basic First Amendment principle:
Government action based on protected speech may under
some circumstances violate the First Amendment even if
the government actor honestly believes the speech is unprotected. And though Justice Scalia suggests that this
principle be limited to licensing schemes and to "deprivation[s] of the freedom of speech specifically through the judicial process," post, at 687 (emphasis in original), we do not
think the logic of the cases supports such a limitation.
Speech can be chilled and punished by administrative action
as much as by judicial processes; in no case have we asserted
or even implied the contrary. In fact, in Speiser v. Randall,
we struck down procedures, on the grounds that they were
insufficiently protective of free speech, which involved both
administrative and judicial components. Speiser, like this
case, dealt with a government decision to deny a speaker
certain benefits--in Speiser a tax exemption, in this case
a government job--based on what the speaker said. Our

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
holding there did not depend on the deprivation taking place
"specifically through the judicial process," and we cannot see
how the result could have been any different had the process
been entirely administrative, with no judicial review. We
cannot sweep aside Speiser and the other cases cited above
as easily as Justice Scalia proposes.

Nonetheless, not every procedure that may safeguard protected speech is constitutionally mandated. True, the procedure adopted by the Court of Appeals may lower the
chance of protected speech being erroneously punished. A
speaker is more protected if she has two opportunities to be
vindicated--first by the employer's investigation and then
by the jury--than just one. But each procedure involves a
different mix of administrative burden, risk of erroneous
punishment of protected speech, and risk of erroneous exculpation of unprotected speech. Though the First Amendment creates a strong presumption against punishing protected speech even inadvertently, the balance need not
always be struck in that direction. We have never, for
instance, required proof beyond a reasonable doubt in civil
cases where First Amendment interests are at stake, though
such a requirement would protect speech more than the
alternative standards would. Compare, e. g., California ex
rel. Cooper v. Mitchell Brothers' Santa Ana Theater, 454
U. S. 90, 93 (1981) (per curiam), with McKinney v. Alabama,
424 U. S. 669, 686 (1976) (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment
in part). Likewise, the possibility that defamation liability
would chill even true speech has not led us to require an
actual malice standard in all libel cases. Dun & Bradstreet,
Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U. S. 749, 761 (1985)
(plurality opinion); Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323
(1974). Nor has the possibility that overbroad regulations
may chill commercial speech convinced us to extend the
overbreadth doctrine into the commercial speech area.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
We have never set forth a general test to determine whena procedural safeguard is required by the First Amendment--just as we have never set forth a general test to de-termine what constitutes a compelling state interest, see
Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 324 (1988), or what categoriesof speech are so lacking in value that they fall outside the
protection of the First Amendment, New York v. Ferber, 458U. S. 747, 763-764 (1982), or many other matters--and we do
not purport to do so now. But though we agree with Justice Scalia that the lack of such a test is inconvenient, seepost, at 687-688, this does not relieve us of our responsibility to decide the case that is before us today. Both Justice
Scalia and we agree that some procedural requirements aremandated by the First Amendment and some are not. See

post, at 686. None of us have discovered a general principleto determine where the line is to be drawn. See post, at
686-688. We must therefore reconcile ourselves to answer-ing the question on a case-by-case basis, at least until some
workable general rule emerges.Accordingly, all we say today is that the propriety of a
proposed procedure must turn on the particular context inwhich the question arises--on the cost of the procedure and
the relative magnitude and constitutional significance of therisks it would decrease and increase. And to evaluate these
factors here we have to return to the issue we dealt with in
Connick and in the cases that came before it: What is itabout the government's role as employer that gives it a freer

hand in regulating the speech of its employees than it has inregulating the speech of the public at large?

B
We have never explicitly answered this question, thoughwe have always assumed that its premise is correct--that

the government as employer indeed has far broader powersthan does the government as sovereign. See,

e. g., Picker-ing, 391 U. S., at 568; Civil Service Comm'n v. Letter Carri511us3$59J 11-08-97 20:06:24 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
ers, 413 U. S. 548, 564 (1973); Connick, 461 U. S., at 147.This assumption is amply borne out by considering the practical realities of government employment, and the many situ-ations in which, we believe, most observers would agree that
the government must be able to restrict its employees'
speech.To begin with, even many of the most fundamental maxims

of our First Amendment jurisprudence cannot reasonably beapplied to speech by government employees. The First
Amendment demands a tolerance of "verbal tumult, discord,and even offensive utterance," as "necessary side effects of
. . . the process of open debate," Cohen v. California, 403
U. S. 15, 24-25 (1971). But we have never expressed doubt
that a government employer may bar its employees from
using Mr. Cohen's offensive utterance to members of the
public or to the people with whom they work. "Under the
First Amendment there is no such thing as a false idea,"
Gertz, supra, at 339; the "fitting remedy for evil counsels
is good ones," Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 375
(1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring). But when an employee
counsels her co-workers to do their job in a way with which
the public employer disagrees, her managers may tell her
to stop, rather than relying on counterspeech. The First
Amendment reflects the "profound national commitment to
the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open." New York Times Co. v.
Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 270 (1964). But though a private
person is perfectly free to uninhibitedly and robustly criticize
a state governor's legislative program, we have never suggested that the Constitution bars the governor from firing a
high-ranking deputy for doing the same thing. Cf. Branti
v. Finkel, 445 U. S. 507, 518 (1980). Even something as close
to the core of the First Amendment as participation in political campaigns may be prohibited to government employees.
Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601 (1973); Letter Carriers, supra; Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U. S. 75 (1947).

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Government employee speech must be treated differentlywith regard to procedural requirements as well. For example, speech restrictions must generally precisely define thespeech they target.

Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U. S. 360, 367-
368 (1964); Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U. S. 46,
55 (1988). Yet surely a public employer may, consistentlywith the First Amendment, prohibit its employees from

being "rude to customers," a standard almost certainly toovague when applied to the public at large. Cf.

Arnett v.
Kennedy, 416 U. S. 134, 158-162 (1974) (plurality opinion)(upholding a regulation that allowed discharges for speech

that hindered the "efficiency of the service"); id., at 164
(Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in result in
part) (agreeing on this point).

Likewise, we have consistently given greater deference to
government predictions of harm used to justify restriction of
employee speech than to predictions of harm used to justify
restrictions on the speech of the public at large. Few of the
examples we have discussed involve tangible, present interference with the agency's operation. The danger in them is
mostly speculative. One could make a respectable argument that political activity by government employees is generally not harmful, see Public Workers v. Mitchell, supra, at
99; or that high officials should allow more public dissent by
their subordinates, see Connick, supra, at 168-169 (Brennan,
J., dissenting); Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, 103
Stat. 16, or that even in a government workplace the free
market of ideas is superior to a command economy. But we
have given substantial weight to government employers'
reasonable predictions of disruption, even when the speech
involved is on a matter of public concern, and even though
when the government is acting as sovereign our review of
legislative predictions of harm is considerably less deferential. Compare, e. g., Connick, supra, at 151-152; Letter Carriers, supra, at 566-567, with Sable Communications of
Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 129 (1989); Texas v. Johnson,

674 WATERS v. CHURCHILL

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
491 U. S. 397, 409 (1989). Similarly, we have refrained fromintervening in government employer decisions that are

based on speech that is of entirely private concern. Doubt-less some such speech is sometimes nondisruptive; doubtless
it is sometimes of value to the speakers and the listeners.
But we have declined to question government employers'decisions on such matters.

Connick, supra, at 146-149.
This does not, of course, show that the First Amendmentshould play no role in government employment decisions.

Government employees are often in the best position toknow what ails the agencies for which they work; public debate may gain much from their informed opinions. Pickering, supra, at 572. And a government employee, like any
citizen, may have a strong, legitimate interest in speaking
out on public matters. In many such situations the government may have to make a substantial showing that the
speech is, in fact, likely to be disruptive before it may be
punished. See, e. g., Rankin v. McPherson, 483 U. S. 378,
388 (1987); Connick, supra, at 152; Pickering, supra, at 569-
571. Moreover, the government may certainly choose to
give additional protections to its employees beyond what
is mandated by the First Amendment, out of respect for
the values underlying the First Amendment, values central
to our social order as well as our legal system. See, e. g.,
Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, supra.

But the above examples do show that constitutional review
of government employment decisions must rest on different
principles than review of speech restraints imposed by the
government as sovereign. The restrictions discussed above
are allowed not just because the speech interferes with the
government's operation. Speech by private people can do
the same, but this does not allow the government to suppress it.

Rather, the extra power the government has in this area
comes from the nature of the government's mission as
employer. Government agencies are charged by law with

511us3$59J 11-08-97 20:06:24 PAGES OPINPGT

675Cite as: 511 U. S. 661 (1994)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
doing particular tasks. Agencies hire employees to help do
those tasks as effectively and efficiently as possible. When
someone who is paid a salary so that she will contribute to
an agency's effective operation begins to do or say things
that detract from the agency's effective operation, the government employer must have some power to restrain her.
The reason the governor may, in the example given above,
fire the deputy is not that this dismissal would somehow be
narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. It
is that the governor and the governor's staff have a job to
do, and the governor justifiably feels that a quieter subordinate would allow them to do this job more effectively.

The key to First Amendment analysis of government employment decisions, then, is this: The government's interest
in achieving its goals as effectively and efficiently as possible
is elevated from a relatively subordinate interest when it
acts as sovereign to a significant one when it acts as employer. The government cannot restrict the speech of the
public at large just in the name of efficiency. But where the
government is employing someone for the very purpose of
effectively achieving its goals, such restrictions may well
be appropriate.

C

1

The Court of Appeals' decision, we believe, gives insufficient weight to the government's interest in efficient employment decisionmaking. In other First Amendment contexts
the need to safeguard possibly protected speech may indeed
outweigh the government's efficiency interests. See, e. g.,
Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51 (1965); Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S., at 526. But where the government is acting
as employer, its efficiency concerns should, as we discussed
above, be assigned a greater value.

The problem with the Court of Appeals' approach--under
which the facts to which the Connick test is applied are de511us3$59J 11-08-97 20:06:24 PAGES OPINPGT
676 WATERS v. CHURCHILL

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
termined by the judicial factfinder--is that it would forcethe government employer to come to its factual conclusions

through procedures that substantially mirror the evidentiaryrules used in court. The government manager would have
to ask not what conclusions she, as an experienced professional, can draw from the circumstances, but rather whatconclusions a jury would later draw. If she relies on hearsay, or on what she knows about the accused employee's char-acter, she must be aware that this evidence might not be
usable in court. If she knows one party is, in her personalexperience, more credible than another, she must realize that
the jury will not share that personal experience. If she
thinks the alleged offense is so egregious that it is proper to
discipline the accused employee even though the evidence is
ambiguous, she must consider that a jury might decide the
other way.

But employers, public and private, often do rely on hearsay, on past similar conduct, on their personal knowledge of
people's credibility, and on other factors that the judicial
process ignores. Such reliance may sometimes be the most
effective way for the employer to avoid future recurrences
of improper and disruptive conduct. What works best in a
judicial proceeding may not be appropriate in the employment context. If one employee accuses another of misconduct, it is reasonable for a government manager to credit the
allegation more if it is consistent with what the manager
knows of the character of the accused. Likewise, a manager
may legitimately want to discipline an employee based on
complaints by patrons that the employee has been rude, even
though these complaints are hearsay.

It is true that these practices involve some risk of erroneously punishing protected speech. The government may
certainly choose to adopt other practices, by law or by contract. But we do not believe that the First Amendment requires it to do so. Government employers should be allowed
to use personnel procedures that differ from the evidentiary

677Cite as: 511 U. S. 661 (1994)

rules used by courts, without fear that these differences willlead to liability.

2
On the other hand, we do not believe that the court mustapply the

Connick test only to the facts as the employerthought them to be, without considering the reasonableness

of the employer's conclusions. Even in situations wherecourts have recognized the special expertise and special
needs of certain decisionmakers, the deference to their con-clusions has never been complete. Cf.

New Jersey v. T. L. O.,469 U. S. 325, 342-343 (1985); United States v. Leon, 468 U. S.

897, 914 (1984); Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U. S.474, 490-491 (1951). It is necessary that the decisionmaker
reach its conclusion about what was said in good faith, ratherthan as a pretext; but it does not follow that good faith is
sufficient. Justice Scalia is right in saying that we haveoften held various laws to require only an inquiry into the
decisionmaker's intent, see post, at 690-691, but, as discussed
supra in Part II-A, this has not been our view of the FirstAmendment.

We think employer decisionmaking will not be unduly bur-dened by having courts look to the facts as the employer
reasonably found them to be. It may be unreasonable, forexample, for the employer to come to a conclusion based on
no evidence at all. Likewise, it may be unreasonable for anemployer to act based on extremely weak evidence when
strong evidence is clearly available--if, for instance, an em-ployee is accused of writing an improper letter to the editor,
and instead of just reading the letter, the employer decideswhat it said based on unreliable hearsay.

If an employment action is based on what an employeesupposedly said, and a reasonable supervisor would recognize that there is a substantial likelihood that what wasactually said was protected, the manager must tread with a
certain amount of care. This need not be the care withwhich trials, with their rules of evidence and procedure, are

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
conducted. It should, however, be the care that a reason-able manager would use before making an employment decision--discharge, suspension, reprimand, or whatever else--of the sort involved in the particular case.

Justice Scalia
correctly points out that such care is normally not constitutionally required unless the employee has a protected prop-erty interest in her job,

post, at 688; see also Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 576-578 (1972);but we believe that the possibility of inadvertently punishing

someone for exercising her First Amendment rights makessuch care necessary.

Of course, there will often be situations in which reasonable employers would disagree about who is to be believed,
or how much investigation needs to be done, or how much
evidence is needed to come to a particular conclusion. In
those situations, many different courses of action will necessarily be reasonable. Only procedures outside the range of
what a reasonable manager would use may be condemned
as unreasonable.

Petitioners argue that Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v.
Doyle, 429 U. S. 274 (1977), forecloses a reasonableness test,
and holds instead that the First Amendment was not violated unless " `the defendant[s'] intent [was] to violate the
plaintiff['s] constitutional rights.' " Brief for Petitioners
25; see also post, at 690 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Justice
Scalia makes a similar argument based on Pickering, Connick, and Perry, which alluded to the impropriety of management "retaliation" for protected speech. Post, at 689.
But in all those cases the employer assertedly knew the true
content of the employee's protected speech, and fired the employee in part because of it. In none of them did we have
occasion to decide what should happen if the defendants hold
an erroneous and unreasonable belief about what plaintiff
said. These cases cannot be read as foreclosing an argument
that they never dealt with. United States v. L. A. Tucker
Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U. S. 33, 38 (1952).

We disagree with Justice Stevens' contention that the
test we adopt "provides less protection for a fundamental
constitutional right than the law ordinarily provides for less
exalted rights." Post, at 695. We have never held that it
is a violation of the Constitution for a government employer
to discharge an employee based on substantively incorrect
information. Where an employee has a property interest in
her job, the only protection we have found the Constitution
gives her is a right to adequate procedure. And an at-will
government employee--such as Churchill apparently was,
App. to Pet. for Cert. 70--generally has no claim based on
the Constitution at all.

Of course, an employee may be able to challenge the substantive accuracy of the employer's factual conclusions under
state contract law, or under some state statute or commonlaw cause of action. In some situations, the employee may
even have a federal statutory claim. See NLRB v.
Burnup & Sims, Inc., 379 U. S. 21 (1964). Likewise, the
State or Federal Governments may, if they choose, provide
similar protection to people fired because of their speech.
But this protection is not mandated by the Constitution.

The one pattern from which our approach does diverge
is the broader protection normally given to people in their
relationship with the government as sovereign. See, e. g.,
New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S., at 279-280, cited
post, at 696, 699 (Stevens, J., dissenting). But the reasons
for this are those discussed supra in Part II-B: "[O]ur `profound national commitment' to the freedom of speech," post,
at 699 (Stevens, J., dissenting), must of necessity operate
differently when the government acts as employer rather
than sovereign.

III

Applying the foregoing to this case, it is clear that if petitioners really did believe Perkins-Graham's and Ballew's

511us3$59J 11-08-97 20:06:24 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
story, and fired Churchill because of it, they must win.Their belief, based on the investigation they conducted,

would have been entirely reasonable. After getting the ini-tial report from Ballew, who overheard the conversation, Waters and Davis approached and interviewed Perkins-Graham,
and then interviewed Ballew again for confirmation. In re-sponse to Churchill's grievance, Hopper met directly with

Churchill to hear her side of the story, and instructed Maginto interview Ballew one more time. Management can spend
only so much of their time on any one employment decision.By the end of the termination process, Hopper, who made
the final decision, had the word of two trusted employees, the
endorsement of those employees' reliability by three hospital
managers, and the benefit of a face-to-face meeting with the
employee he fired. With that in hand, a reasonable manager
could have concluded that no further time needed to be
taken. As respondents themselves point out, "if the belief
an employer forms supporting its adverse personnel action is
`reasonable,' an employer has no need to investigate further."
Brief for Respondents 39.

And under the Connick test, Churchill's speech as reported by Perkins-Graham and Ballew was unprotected.
Even if Churchill's criticism of cross-training reported by
Perkins-Graham and Ballew was speech on a matter of public
concern--something we need not decide--the potential disruptiveness of the speech as reported was enough to outweigh whatever First Amendment value it might have had.
According to Ballew, Churchill's speech may have substantially dampened Perkins-Graham's interest in working in
obstetrics. Discouraging people from coming to work for a
department certainly qualifies as disruption. Moreover,
Perkins-Graham perceived Churchill's statements about Waters to be "unkind and inappropriate," and told management
that she knew they could not continue to "tolerate that kind
of negativism" from Churchill. This is strong evidence that
Churchill's complaining, if not dealt with, threatened to un511us3$59J 11-08-97 20:06:24 PAGES OPINPGT

681Cite as: 511 U. S. 661 (1994)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
dermine management's authority in Perkins-Graham's eyes.And finally, Churchill's statement, as reported by PerkinsGraham, that it "wasn't possible" to "wipe the slate clean"between her and Waters could certainly make management
doubt Churchill's future effectiveness. As a matter of law,
this potential disruptiveness was enough to outweigh what-ever First Amendment value the speech might have had.

This is so even if, as Churchill suggests, Davis and Waterswere "[d]eliberately [i]ndifferent," Brief for Respondents 31,
to the possibility that much of the rest of the conversationwas solely about cross-training. So long as Davis and Waters discharged Churchill only for the part of the speech that
was either not on a matter of public concern, or on a matter
of public concern but disruptive, it is irrelevant whether the
rest of the speech was, unbeknownst to them, both on a matter of public concern and nondisruptive. The Connick test
is to be applied to the speech for which Churchill was fired.
Cf. Connick, 461 U. S., at 149 (evaluating the disruptiveness
of part of plaintiff 's speech because that part was "upon a
matter of public concern and contributed to [plaintiff 's] discharge" (emphasis added)); Mt. Healthy, 429 U. S., at 286-
287. An employee who makes an unprotected statement is
not immunized from discipline by the fact that this statement
is surrounded by protected statements.

Nonetheless, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the
District Court erred in granting summary judgment in petitioners' favor. Though Davis and Waters would have been
justified in firing Churchill for the statements outlined
above, there remains the question whether Churchill was
actually fired because of those statements, or because of
something else. See Mt. Healthy, supra, at 286-287.

Churchill has produced enough evidence to create a material issue of disputed fact about petitioners' actual motivation. Churchill had criticized the cross-training policy in the
past; management had exhibited some sensitivity about the
criticisms; Churchill pointed to some other conduct by hospi511us3$59J 11-08-97 20:06:24 PAGES OPINPGT

tal management that, if viewed in the light most favorableto her, would show that they were hostile to her because of

her criticisms. 977 F. 2d, at 1125-1126. A reasonable fact-finder might therefore, on this record, conclude that petitioners actually fired Churchill not because of the disruptive
things she said to Perkins-Graham, but because of nondis-ruptive statements about cross-training that they thought

she may have made in the same conversation, or because ofother statements she may have made earlier. If this is so,
then the court will have to determine whether those state-ments were protected speech, a different matter than the
one before us now.Because of our conclusion, we need not determine whether
the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. We also
need not decide whether the defendants were acting pur-suant to hospital policy or custom, because that question,

though argued by petitioners in their merits brief, was notpresented in the petition for certiorari. See

Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceed-ings consistent with this opinion.

I join Justice O'Connor's plurality opinion stating that,under the Free Speech Clause, a public employer who reasonably believes a third-party report that an employee en-gaged in constitutionally unprotected speech may punish the
employee in reliance on that report, even if it turns out thatthe employee's actual remarks were constitutionally protected. I add these words to emphasize that, in order to
avoid liability, the public employer must not only reasonably
investigate the third-party report, but must also actually be511us3$59M 11-08-97 20:06:24 PAGES OPINPGT

lieve it. Under the plurality's opinion, an objectively rea-sonable investigation that fails to convince the employer that

the employee actually engaged in disruptive or otherwiseunprotected speech does not inoculate the employer against
constitutional liability. A public employer violates the Free
Speech Clause, that is, by invoking a third-party report topenalize an employee when the employer, despite the report

and the reasonable investigation into it, believes or genuinelysuspects that the employee's speech was protected in its
entirety or in that part on which the employer purports torely in taking disciplinary action; or if the employer invokes
the third-party report merely as a pretext to shield disciplinary action taken because of protected speech the employer
believes or genuinely suspects that the employee uttered at
another time.

First Amendment limitations on public employers, as the
plurality explains, must reflect a balance of the public employer's interest in accomplishing its mission and the public
employee's interest in speaking on matters of public concern.
See ante, at 668-675. Where an employer penalizes an employee on the basis of a third-party report of speech that the
employer should have suspected, based on the content of the
report and the employer's familiarity with the employee and
the workplace, to have been constitutionally protected, this
balance must reflect the facts that employees' speech on matters of public concern will often (as we said of employees'
union activities) "engende[r] strong emotions and giv[e] rise
to active rumors," and, critically, that "the example of employees who are discharged on false charges would or might
have a deterrent effect on other employees." NLRB v.
Burnup & Sims, Inc., 379 U. S. 21, 23 (1964); see also Rankin
v. McPherson, 483 U. S. 378, 384 (1987) (" `[T]he threat of
dismissal from public employment is . . . a potent means of
inhibiting speech' ") (quoting Pickering v. Board of Ed. of
Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563,
574 (1968)). As the plurality's opinion frankly recognizes,

permitting public employers to punish employees in relianceon third-party reports "involve[s] some risk of erroneously

punishing protected speech." Ante, at 676.This is a risk that the public employer's interests justify
tolerating, as the plurality's opinion explains, but only whenthe public employer's conduct was reasonable, see

ante, at677-678, and only when the employer "really did believe"

the third-party report, ante, at 679; see also ante, at 680 (anemployer need not investigate further " `if the belief an employer forms supporting its adverse personnel action is "rea-sonable" ' ") (citation omitted); ante, at 677 (courts must "look
to the facts as the employer reasonably found them to be")(emphasis deleted).* A public employer who did not really
believe that the employee engaged in disruptive or otherwisepunishable speech can assert no legitimate interest strong
enough to justify chilling protected expression, whether theemployer affirmatively disbelieved the third-party report or
merely doubted its accuracy. Imposing liability on such anemployer respects the "longstanding recognition that the
First Amendment's primary aim is the full protection ofspeech upon issues of public concern, as well as the practical
realities involved in the administration of a government of-fice." Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138, 154 (1983).

Accordingly, even though petitioners conducted an objec-tively reasonable investigation into Ballew's report about
respondent Churchill's conversation with Perkins-Graham,I believe that petitioners' dismissal of Churchill would have
violated the Free Speech Clause if after the investigationthey doubted the accuracy of the report and fired Churchill
for speech, or for a portion of her speech, that they genuinelysuspected was nondisruptive (assuming that the speech was

*In addition, and also because of the risk of chilling protected expression, the public employer must believe that the discipline chosen is an
appropriate, and not excessive, response to the employee's speech as reported. I do not understand respondents in this case to raise any claim
that the discharge was pretextual in this respect.

actually on a matter of public concern). Though under theplurality's opinion the presentation of such an argument is

open to Churchill on remand, Churchill would not, of course,have to rely on it if she can establish that, despite the reasonable investigation, petitioners believed that Churchill saidnothing disruptive in her conversation with Perkins-Graham;
that they believed that Churchill made some nondisruptiveremarks to Perkins-Graham and fired her because of those
remarks; or that they fired her because of nondisruptivecomments about cross-training they knew she made earlier
(again, assuming in each case that the speech at issue was ona matter of public concern).

II
Though Justice O'Connor's opinion speaks for just fourMembers of the Court, the reasonableness test it sets out is

clearly the one that lower courts should apply. A majorityof the Court agrees that employers whose conduct survives
the plurality's reasonableness test cannot be held constitu-tionally liable (assuming the absence of pretext), see ante, at
679-681 (plurality opinion); post, at 686-692 (Scalia, J., con-curring in judgment); and a majority (though a different one)
is of the view that employers whose conduct fails the plu-rality's reasonableness test have violated the Free Speech
Clause, see ante, at 677-678 (plurality opinion); post, at 694-699 (

Stevens, J., dissenting); see also post, at 697-698, n. 4(
Stevens, J., dissenting) ("Justice O'Connor appropriatelyrejects [

Accordingly, the plurality opinion may be taken to state theholding of the Court. See

Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure" v. Attorney General ofMass., 383 U. S. 413 (1966)).

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Kennedy and
Justice Thomas join, concurring in the judgment.

The central issue in this case is whether we shall adhereto our previously stated rule that a public employer's disciplining of an employee violates the Speech and Press Clauseof the First Amendment only if it is in retaliation for the
employee's speech on a matter of public concern. Justice
O'Connor would add to this prohibition a requirement thatthe employer conduct an investigation before taking disciplinary action in certain circumstances. This recognition of abroad new First Amendment procedural right is in my view
unprecedented, superfluous to the decision in the presentcase, unnecessary for protection of public-employee speech
on matters of public concern, and unpredictable in its appli-cation and consequences.

I
I do not doubt that the First Amendment contains withinit some procedural prescriptions--that in some circumstances, "the freedom of speech" recognized by the Constitu-tion consisted of a right to speak unless and until certain
procedures to prevent the speech had first been compliedwith. Thus, for example, I have no quarrel in principle with
(though I have not inquired into the historical justificationfor) decisions such as Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51
(1965), which established the administrative and judicialreview provisions that a film licensing process must contain
in order to avoid constituting an unconstitutional prior re-straint, see

Patterson v. Colorado ex rel. Attorney Generalof Colo., 205 U. S. 454, 462 (1907) (Holmes, J.).

We have, however, been most circumspect about acknowl-edging procedural components of the First Amendment. Almost all of the cases Justice O'Connor cites as exemplarsare elaborations upon the limitation on defamation suits first

announced in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254(1964). See, e. g., Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United

States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485 (1984); Philadelphia Newspapers,Inc. v. Hepps, 475 U. S. 767 (1986); Masson v. New Yorker
Magazine, Inc., 501 U. S. 496 (1991). These cases deal withalleged governmental deprivation of the freedom of speech
specifically through the judicial process, in which contextprocedures are necessarily central to the discussion.*
Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513 (1958), also involved judicial(and pre-judicial adjudicative) process, holding that a state
tax deduction could not be denied for a speech-related reason(advocacy of overthrow of the Government of the United
States or of the State by unlawful means) by placing theburden of disproving that speech-related reason upon the
taxpayer. Moreover, although the existence of a FirstAmendment right was central to the Court's reasoning, the
decision was squarely rested on the Due Process Clause, seeid., at 529, and not on the First Amendment, see id., at 517,
n. 3. The last case cited by Justice O'Connor, Freedman,
supra, was, as I described earlier, a prior restraint case;review and requirement of procedures were to be expected.

In today's opinion by Justice O'Connor, our previousparsimony is abandoned, in favor of a general principle that
"it is important to ensure not only that the substantive FirstAmendment standards are sound, but also that they are applied through reliable procedures," ante, at 669. Althoughwe are assured that "not every procedure that may safeguard protected speech is constitutionally mandated," ante,at 670, the implication of that assurance is that many are.
We never are informed how to tell mandated speech-safeguarding procedures from nonmandated ones, except
for the clue that "each procedure involves a different mixof administrative burden, risk of erroneous punishment of

*Moreover, the remedy in that context is self-evident: remand for readjudication pursuant to the proper procedures. In the present context,
by contrast, the remedy is not all clear, see infra, at 693-694.

protected speech, and risk of erroneous exculpation ofunprotected speech,"

ibid.
The proposed right to an investigation before dismissal forspeech not only expands the concept of "First Amendment

procedure" into brand new areas, but brings it into disharmony with our cases involving government employment de-cided under the Due Process Clause. As

Justice O'Connor acknowledges, see ante, at 678, those cases hold thatpublic employees who, like Churchill, lack a protected property interest in their jobs, are not entitled to any sort ofa hearing before dismissal. See,

e. g., Board of Regents of
State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 577-578 (1972). Such
employees can be dismissed with impunity (insofar as federal
constitutional protections are concerned) for the reason, accurate or not, that they are incompetent, that they have been
guilty of unexcused absences, that they have stolen money
from the faculty honor bar--or indeed for no reason at all.
But under Justice O'Connor's opinion, if a reason happens
to be given, and if the reason relates to speech and "there
is a substantial likelihood that what was actually said was
protected," (whatever that means), ante, at 677, an investigation to assure that the speech was not the sort protected
by the First Amendment must be conducted--after which,
presumably, the dismissal can still proceed even if the speech
was not what the employer had thought it was, so long as it
was not speech on an issue of public importance. In the
present case, for example, if the requisite "First Amendment
investigation" disclosed that Nurse Churchill had not been
demeaning her superiors, but had been complaining about
the perennial end-of-season slump of the Chicago Cubs, her
dismissal, erroneous as it was, would have been perfectly
OK.

This is a strange jurisprudence indeed. And the reason
it is strange is that Justice O'Connor has in effect converted the government employer's First Amendment liability with respect to "public concern" speech from liability for

689Cite as: 511 U. S. 661 (1994)
Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
intentional wrong to liability for mere negligence. Whatshe proposes is, at bottom, not new procedural protections

for established First Amendment rights, but rather newFirst Amendment rights. Pickering v. Board of Ed. of
Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563(1968), did not require government-employer "protection" of
"public concern" speech, but merely forbade government-employer hostility to such speech. "[I]t is essential,"

Pick-ering said, "that [public employees] be able to speak out

freely on such questions without fear of retaliatory dis-missal." Id., at 572 (emphasis added). See also Connick v.
Myers, 461 U. S. 138, 149 (1983) (same). The critical inquiryfor the factfinder in these cases is whether the employment
decision was, "in fact, made in retaliation for [the] exerciseof the constitutional right of free speech."

Perry v. Sinder-mann, 408 U. S. 593, 598 (1972). A category of employee

speech is certainly not being "retaliated against" if it is nomore and no less subject to being mistaken for a disciplinable
infraction than is any other category of speech or conduct.

II
The creation of procedural First Amendment rights in thiscase is all the more remarkable because it is unnecessary to

the disposition of the matter. After imposing the new dutyupon government employers,

Justice O'Connor's opinionconcludes that it was satisfied anyway--

i. e., that the investi-gation conducted by the hospital was "entirely reasonable."

Ante, at 680. And then, to make the creation of the newduty doubly irrelevant, it finds that the case must be remanded anyway for a pretext inquiry: whether "petitionersactually fired Churchill not because of the disruptive things
she said to Perkins-Graham, but because of nondisruptivestatements about cross-training that they thought she may
have made in the same conversation, or because of otherstatements she may have made earlier."

Ante, at 682; seealso ante, at 682-685 (
Souter, J., concurring). Surely this

511us3$59K 11-08-97 20:06:24 PAGES OPINPGT
690 WATERS v. CHURCHILL

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
offends the doctrine that constitutional questions that neednot be addressed should be avoided.

The requirement of a pretext inquiry, I think, renders cre-ation of the new First Amendment right of investigation
not only superfluous to the disposition of the present case,
but superfluous to the protection of previously establishedspeech rights.

Justice O'Connor makes no attempt to
justify the right of investigation on historical grounds (itis quite unheard of). The entire asserted basis for it is pragmatic and functional: without it the government employee'sright not to be fired for his speech cannot be protected. The
availability of a pretext inquiry disproves that argument.
Judicial inquiry into the genuineness of a public employer's asserted permissible justification for an employment
decision--be it unprotected speech, general insubordination,
or laziness--is all that is necessary to avoid the targeting
of "public interest" speech condemned in Pickering.

Our cases have hitherto considered this sort of inquiry all
the protection needed. Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v.
Doyle, 429 U. S. 274 (1977), involved an arguably weaker case
for the public employer than the present one, in that there
was a "mixed motive" for the disciplinary action--that is, the
employer admitted that the "public concern" speech was part
of the reason for the discharge, but asserted that other valid
reasons were in any event sufficient. In deciding that case,
we found no need to invent procedural requirements, but
simply directed the District Court "to determine whether
the Board had shown by a preponderance of the evidence
that it would have reached the same decision as to respondent's [e]mployment even in the absence of the protected conduct." Id., at 287. The objective, we said, was to "protec[t]
against the invasion of constitutional rights without commanding undesirable consequences not necessary to the assurance of those rights." Ibid.

The Court considers "pretext" analysis sufficient in many
other areas. See, e. g., Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Techni511us3$59K 11-08-97 20:06:24 PAGES OPINPGT

Hernandez v. New York, 500 U. S. 352, 363-364 (1991) (plurality opinion) (constitutionality of peremptory challenges);

(1989) (employment discrimination suit under 42 U. S. C.

claim against legislation); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.
Green, 411 U. S. 792, 804-805 (1973) (discrimination claim
under Title VII). And it considers "pretext" analysis sufficient in other First Amendment contexts. For example, in
Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, 54 (1986),
after holding that zoning laws restricting the location of
movie theaters do not violate the First Amendment unless
they are a pretext for preventing free speech, we did not
think it necessary to prescribe "reasonable" procedures for
zoning commissions across the Nation; we left it to factfinders to determine whether zoning regulations are prompted
by legitimate or improper factors. See also Arcara v. Cloud
Books, Inc., 478 U. S. 697, 708 (1986) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (same). There is no reason why the same approach
should not suffice here.

Justice Stevens believes that "pretext" review is inadequate, since "it provides less protection for a fundamental
constitutional right than the law ordinarily provides for less
exalted rights"; and "[o]rdinarily," he contends, "when someone acts to another person's detriment based upon a factual
judgment, the actor assumes the risk that an impartial adjudicator may come to a different conclusion." Post, at 696.
But that is true in contractual realms only to the extent that
the contract provides a "right" whose elimination constitutes
a legal "detriment." An employee dismissable at will can

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
be fired on the basis of an erroneous factual judgment, withno legal recourse--which is what happened here. Churchill

also had a noncontractual right: the right not to be dismissed(even from an at-will government job) in retaliation for her
expression of views on a matter of public concern. Thatright was not violated, since she was dismissed for another
reason, erroneous though it may have been. The issue be-fore us has nothing to do with according the deprivation of
a right the ordinary degree of protection; it has to do withexpanding the protection accorded a government employee's
public interest speech from (1) protection against retaliation,to (2) protection against retaliation and mistake.

III
The approach to this case adopted by Justice O'Connor'sopinion provides more questions than answers, subjecting

public employers to intolerable legal uncertainty. Despitethe difficulties courts already encounter in distinguishing
between protected and unprotected speech, see, e. g., Millerv. California, 413 U. S. 15, 22 (1973), and in determining
whether speech pertains to a matter of public concern, com-pare O'Connor v. Steeves, 994 F. 2d 905, 915 (CA1), cert. denied, 510 U. S. 1024 (1993), with Gillum v. City of Kerrville,3 F. 3d 117, 120-121 (CA5 1993), cert. denied, 510 U. S. 1072
(1994), Justice O'Connor creates yet another speech-related puzzlement that government employers, judges, and
juries must struggle to solve. The new constitutional dutyto provide certain minimum procedural protections is triggered when "an employment action is based on what an em-ployee supposedly said, and a reasonable supervisor would
recognize that there is a substantial likelihood that what wasactually said was protected," ante, at 677. But on what does
the "reasonable supervisor" base his judgment as to whether"there is a substantial likelihood that what was actually said
was protected?" Can he base it upon the report of what wassaid? Seemingly not, since otherwise

693Cite as: 511 U. S. 661 (1994)
Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
would not have found the minimum procedural protectionof investigation to have been required in the present case

(the report of Churchill's conversation gave no hint of pro-tected speech). It remains entirely unclear what the employer's judgment must be based on. To avoid liability, he
had better assume that it must be based on what was actually said--which means that he had better investigate the
incident in order to determine whether he has an obligationto investigate the incident. Hopefully I am wrong, however,

and (despite today's holding) the basis for judging whetherinvestigation is required will be solely the

report. Then
the public employer will only have to figure out what a hypothetical reasonable supervisor would infer about actual
speech from that report, and then determine whether that
constructed "actual speech" has a substantial likelihood of
being on a matter of public concern. May the employer
at least assume that no investigation is required if the
report does not mention speech? Or can he be liable if
the recommended basis for the discipline (for example,
"disrupting the workplace") had a substantial likelihood of
involving speech which would have had a substantial likelihood of being on a subject of public concern? I suppose ultimately it will be up to the jury to answer all these nice,
once-removed questions. Or come to think of it, perhaps it
will be up to the judge. Justice O'Connor does not specify
whether all this is a question of law or fact.

Justice O'Connor states that "employer decisionmaking
will not be unduly burdened by having courts look to the
facts as the employer reasonably found them to be." Ante,
at 677 (emphasis in original). This explains the subsequent
course of events when the employer's investigation has been
found reasonable: The court (or the jury) decides whether,
on the facts as found by the employer, the speech was on a
matter of public concern, and if not, whether the employer's
reliance on the report was pretextual. But what happens
when the employer's investigation has been found unrea511us3$59K 11-08-97 20:06:24 PAGES OPINPGT

Stevens, J., dissenting
sonable? I presume that there has then been established aviolation of the procedural component of the First Amendment--the failure to treat possibly protected speech with therequisite "amount of care"--without regard to whether the
employee's speech was in fact on a matter of public concern.
Justice O'Connor does not reveal what the remedy forthis violation is to be. There are various possibilities: One

could say that the discharge without observance of the con-stitutionally requisite procedures is invalid, and must be
set aside unless and until those procedures are compliedwith. Alternatively, one could charge the employer who
failed to conduct a reasonable investigation with knowledgeof the protected speech that a jury later finds--producing a
sort of constructive retaliatory discharge, and entitling the
employee to full reinstatement and damages. Or alternatively again, the jury could be required to determine what
information a reasonable investigation would have turned
up, and then to decide whether it would have been permissible for the employer to fire the employee based on that
information.

These are only a few of the numerous questions left unanswered by Justice O'Connor's opinion. Loose ends are
the inevitable consequence of judicial invention. We will
spend decades trying to improvise the limits of this new
First Amendment procedure that is unmentioned in text and
unformed by tradition. It seems to me clear that game is
not worth the candle, given the adequacy of "pretext" analysis to protect the constitutional interest at stake.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Blackmun joins,
dissenting.

This is a free country. Every American has the right to
express an opinion on issues of public significance. In the
private sector, of course, the exercise of that right may entail
unpleasant consequences. Absent some contractual or statutory provision limiting its prerogatives, a private-sector

Stevens, J., dissenting
employer may discipline or fire employees for speaking theirminds. The First Amendment, however, demands that the

government respect its employees' freedom to express theiropinions on issues of public importance. As long as that expression is not unduly disruptive, it simply may not providethe basis for discipline or termination. The critical issues in
a case of this kind are (1) whether the speech is protected,and (2) whether it was the basis for the sanction imposed on
the employee.Applying these standards to the case before us is quite
straightforward. Everyone agrees that respondent CherylChurchill was fired because of what she said in a conversation with co-workers during a dinner break. Given the pos-ture in which this case comes to us, we must assume that
Churchill's statements were fully protected by the FirstAmendment.

1 Nevertheless, the plurality concludes that a

dismissal for speech is valid as a matter of law as long asthe public employer reasonably believed that the employee's

speech was unprotected. See ante, at 677-678. This con-clusion is erroneous because it provides less protection for
a fundamental constitutional right than the law ordinarilyprovides for less exalted rights, including contractual and
statutory rights applicable in the private sector.If, for example, a hospital employee had a contract providing that she could retain her job for a year if she followedthe employer's rules and did competent work, that employee

1 On review of the Court of Appeals' reversal of a summary judgment
for petitioners, we naturally accept as true the version of Churchill's statements described in her testimony and that of two supporting witnesses.
See 977 F. 2d 1114, 1118-1126 (CA7 1992). According to Churchill,
Thomas Koch, and Jean Welty, the dinner-break conversation concerned
the merits of hospital policy, and Churchill did not direct any "personal
criticism" against her supervisors. See id., at 1118-1119, 1122. According to two other witnesses, Melanie Perkins-Graham and Mary Lou Ballew, Churchill's speech was filled with "unkind and inappropriate . . .
things," "negativism," and personal comment about petitioner Cynthia
Waters and the hospital administration. Id., at 1118-1119.

could not be fired because her supervisor reasonably but mistakenly believed she had been late to work or given a patient
the wrong medicine. Ordinarily, when someone acts to another person's detriment based upon a factual judgment, the
actor assumes the risk that an impartial adjudicator may
come to a different conclusion.2 Our legal system generally
delegates the determination of facts upon which important
rights depend to neutral factfinders, notwithstanding the
attendant risks of error and overdeterrence.

Federal constitutional rights merit at least the normal degree of protection. Doubts concerning the ability of juries
to find the truth, an ability for which we usually have high
regard, should be resolved in favor of, not against, the
protection of First Amendment rights. See, e. g., New York
Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 279-280 (1964). Unfortunately, the plurality underestimates the importance of freedom of speech for the more than 18 million civilian employees
of this country's Federal, State, and local Governments,3 and

subordinates that freedom to an abstract interest in bureaucratic efficiency. The need for governmental efficiency that
so concerns the plurality is amply protected by the substan2 In NLRB v. Burnup & Sims, Inc., 379 U. S. 21 (1964), two employee
labor organizers were fired based upon a report that they had threatened
to dynamite the employer's plant if a coming representation election was
unsuccessful. The National Labor Relations Board found that the employees had never made the threatening statements. Although we recognized that the employer had acted in good faith, this Court held that the
discharge "plainly violated" the organizers' right under $ 8 of the National
Labor Relations Act. Id., at 22. "Union activity," we observed, "often
engenders strong emotions and gives rise to active rumors. A protected
activity acquires a precarious status if innocent employees can be discharged while engaging in it, even though the employer acts in good faith."
Id., at 23. The plurality does not explain why First Amendment rights
should receive any lesser protection than the statutory right at issue in
Burnup & Sims.

tive limits on public employees' rights of expression. See
generally Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138 (1983); Pickering
v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will
Cty., 391 U. S. 563 (1968). Efficiency does not demand an
additional layer of deference to employers' "reasonable" factual errors. Today's ruling will surely deter speech that
would be fully protected under Pickering and Connick.

The plurality correctly points out that we have never decided whether the governing version of the facts in public
employment free speech cases is "what the government employer thought was said, or . . . what the trier of fact ultimately determines to have been said." Ante, at 664.4 To

4 Justice Scalia would recharacterize employees' right to free speech
as a more modest protection against "retaliatory" discharges, a protection
that would not extend to those terminated for speech that was fully protected but incorrectly reported. The only support he cites for this restrictive theory is that three of our prior public employment speech opinions have used the word "retaliation." See ante, at 688-689 (opinion
concurring in judgment) (citing Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138, 149 (1983);
Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593, 598 (1972); Pickering v. Board of Ed.
of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563, 572 (1968)).
Our use of that word in the cases Justice Scalia cites, however, does not
resolve the present question, since none of those decisions involved any
factual dispute over the content of employee speech. More importantly,
other passages from two of those opinions support the view that the
causal connection between the employee's speech and her discharge is
all the "retaliation" that must be shown. See Perry, 408 U. S., at 598
(nonrenewal of a teacher's contract "may not be predicated on his exercise
of First and Fourteenth Amendment rights"); ibid. ("[A] teacher's public

criticism of his superiors on matters of public concern may be constitutionally protected and may, therefore, be an impermissible basis for termination of his employment"); Pickering, 391 U. S., at 574 ("In sum, . . . a
teacher's exercise of his right to speak on issues of public importance may
not furnish the basis for his dismissal from public employment"). Precedent certainly does not command Justice Scalia's approach, and nothing
in the First Amendment recommends a rule that makes ignorance or mistake a complete defense for a discharge based on fully protected speech.
Justice O'Connor appropriately rejects that position, at least for those
instances in which the employer unreasonably believes an incorrect report

Stevens, J., dissenting
me it is clear that the latter must be controlling. The FirstAmendment assures public employees that they may express

their views on issues of public concern without fear of disci-pline or termination as long as they do so in an appropriate
manner and at an appropriate time and place. A violation
occurs when a public employee is fired for uttering speechon a matter of public concern that is not unduly disruptive

of the operations of the relevant agency. The violation doesnot vanish merely because the firing was based upon a reasonable mistake about what the employee said.5 A FirstAmendment claimant need not allege bad faith; the controlling question is not the regularity of the agency's investiga-tive procedures, or the purity of its motives, but whether the
employee's freedom of speech has been "abridged."The risk that a jury may ultimately view the facts differently from even a conscientious employer is not, as the plurality would have it, a needless fetter on public employers'
ability to discharge their duties. It is the normal means by
which our legal system protects legal rights and encourages
those in authority to act with care. Here, for example, attention to "conclusions a jury would later draw," ante, at 676,
about the content of Churchill's speech might have caused
petitioners to talk to Churchill about what she said before
deciding to fire her. There is nothing unfair or onerous

concerning speech that was in fact protected and disciplines an employee
based upon that misunderstanding. I, of course, agree with Justice
O'Connor that discipline in such circumstances violates the First
Amendment.

5 The reasonableness of the public employer's mistake would, of course,

bear on whether that employer should be liable for damages. See Butz
v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478, 507 (1978) ("Federal officials will not be liable
for mere mistakes in judgment, whether the mistake is one of fact or one
of law"). It is wrong, however, to constrict the substantive reach of a
public employee's right of free speech in response to such remedial considerations. See ante, at 677 (government employers who use reasonable
procedures should be free to act "without fear [of] liability") (emphasis
added).

about putting the risk of error on an employer in thesecircumstances.

Government agencies are often the site of sharp differ-ences over a wide range of important public issues. In offices where the First Amendment commands respect for can-did deliberation and individual opinion, such disagreements
are both inevitable and desirable. When those who worktogether disagree, reports of speech are often skewed, and
supervisors are apt to misconstrue even accurate reports.The plurality, observing that managers "can spend only so
much of their time on any one employment decision," ante, at680, adopts a rule that invites discipline, rather than further
discussion, when such disputes arise. That rule is unwise,for deliberation within the government, like deliberation
about it, is an essential part of our "profound national com-mitment" to the freedom of speech. Cf. New York Times,
376 U. S., at 270. A proper regard for that principle re-quires that, before firing a public employee for her speech,
management get its facts straight.I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

6 Because there is no dispute that Churchill was fired for the content of
her speech, this case does not involve the problem of determining whether
the public employee would have been terminated anyway for reasons unrelated to speech. See Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S.
274 (1977).

PUD NO. 1 OF JEFFERSON COUNTY et al. v.WASHINGTON DEPARTMENT OF

ECOLOGY et al.
certiorari to the supreme court of washington

No. 92-1911. Argued February 23, 1994--Decided May 31, 1994
Section 303 of the Clean Water Act requires each State, subject to federal

approval, to institute comprehensive standards establishing water quality goals for all intrastate waters, and requires that such standards "consist of the designated uses of the navigable waters involved and the
water quality criteria for such waters based upon such uses." Under
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations, the standards
must also include an antidegradation policy to ensure that "[e]xisting
instream water uses and the level of water quality necessary to protect
[those] uses [are] maintained and protected." States are required by

$ 401 of the Act to provide a water quality certification before a federal
license or permit can be issued for any activity that may result in a
discharge into intrastate navigable waters. As relevant here, the certification must "set forth any effluent limitations and other limitations . . .
necessary to assure that any applicant" will comply with various provisions of the Act and "any other appropriate" state law requirement.

$ 401(d). Under Washington's comprehensive water quality standards,
characteristic uses of waters classified as Class AA include fish migration, rearing, and spawning. Petitioners, a city and a local utility district, want to build a hydroelectric project on the Dosewallips River, a
Class AA water, which would reduce the water flow in the relevant part
of the river to a minimal residual flow of between 65 and 155 cubic feet
per second (cfs). In order to protect the river's fishery, respondent
state environmental agency issued a $ 401 certification imposing, among
other things, a minimum stream flow requirement of between 100 and
200 cfs. A state administrative appeals board ruled that the certification condition exceeded respondent's authority under state law, but the
State Superior Court reversed. The State Supreme Court affirmed,
holding that the antidegradation provisions of the State's water quality
standards require the imposition of minimum stream flows, and that

$ 401 authorized the stream flow condition and conferred on States
power to consider all state action related to water quality in imposing
conditions on $ 401 certificates.

Held: Washington's minimum stream flow requirement is a permissible

condition of a $ 401 certification. Pp. 710-723.

Syllabus
(a) A State may impose conditions on certifications insofar as necessary to enforce a designated use contained in the State's water quality
standard. Petitioners' claim that the State may only impose water
quality limitations specifically tied to a "discharge" is contradicted by

$ 401(d)'s reference to an applicant's compliance, which allows a State to
impose "other limitations" on a project. This view is consistent with
EPA regulations providing that activities--not merely discharges--
must comply with state water quality standards, a reasonable interpretation of $ 401 which is entitled to deference. State standards adopted
pursuant to $ 303 are among the "other limitations" with which a State
may ensure compliance through the $ 401 certification process. Although $ 303 is not specifically listed in $ 401(d), the statute allows States
to impose limitations to ensure compliance with $ 301 of the Act, and

$ 301 in turn incorporates $ 303 by reference. EPA's view supports this
interpretation. Such limitations are also permitted by $ 401(d)'s reference to "any other appropriate" state law requirement. Pp. 710-713.

(b) Washington's requirement is a limitation necessary to enforce the
designated use of the river as a fish habitat. Petitioners err in asserting that $ 303 requires States to protect such uses solely through implementation of specific numerical "criteria." The section's language
makes it plain that water quality standards contain two components and
is most naturally read to require that a project be consistent with both:
the designated use and the water quality criteria. EPA has not interpreted $ 303 to require the States to protect designated uses exclusively
through enforcement of numerical criteria. Moreover, the Act permits
enforcement of broad, narrative criteria based on, for example, "aesthetics." There is no anomaly in the State's reliance on both use designations and criteria to protect water quality. Rather, it is petitioners'
reading that leads to an unreasonable interpretation of the Act, since
specified criteria cannot reasonably be expected to anticipate all the
water quality issues arising from every activity that can affect a State's
hundreds of individual water bodies. Washington's requirement also is
a proper application of the state and federal antidegradation regulations,
as it ensures that an existing instream water use will be "maintained
and protected." Pp. 713-719.

(c) Petitioners' assertion that the Act is only concerned with water
quality, not quantity, makes an artificial distinction, since a sufficient
lowering of quantity could destroy all of a river's designated uses, and
since the Act recognizes that reduced stream flow can constitute water
pollution. Moreover, $$ 101(g) and 510(2) of the Act do not limit the
scope of water pollution controls that may be imposed on users who have
obtained, pursuant to state law, a water allocation. Those provisions
preserve each State's authority to allocate water quantity as between

users, but the $ 401 certification does not purport to determine petitioners' proprietary right to the river's water. In addition, the Court is
unwilling to read implied limitations into $ 401 based on petitioners'
claim that a conflict exists between the condition's imposition and the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's authority to license hydroelectric projects under the Federal Power Act, since FERC has not yet
acted on petitioners' license application and since $ 401's certification
requirement also applies to other statutes and regulatory schemes.

704 PUD NO. 1 OF JEFFERSON CTY. v. WASHINGTON

DEPT. OF ECOLOGY

Opinion of the Court

I
This case involves the complex statutory and regulatory
scheme that governs our Nation's waters, a scheme that implicates both federal and state administrative responsibilities. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, commonly
known as the Clean Water Act, 86 Stat. 816, as amended, 33
U. S. C. $ 1251 et seq., is a comprehensive water quality statute designed to "restore and maintain the chemical, physical,
and biological integrity of the Nation's waters." $ 1251(a).
The Act also seeks to attain "water quality which provides for the protection and propagation of fish, shellfish, and
wildlife." $ 1251(a)(2).

To achieve these ambitious goals, the Clean Water Act establishes distinct roles for the Federal and State Governments. Under the Act, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is required, among other
things, to establish and enforce technology-based limitations
on individual discharges into the country's navigable waters
from point sources. See $$ 1311, 1314. Section 303 of the
Act also requires each State, subject to federal approval, to
institute comprehensive water quality standards establishing water quality goals for all intrastate waters. $$ 1311(b)
(1)(C), 1313. These state water quality standards provide
"a supplementary basis . . . so that numerous point sources,
despite individual compliance with effluent limitations, may
be further regulated to prevent water quality from falling
below acceptable levels." EPA v. California ex rel. State
Water Resources Control Bd., 426 U. S. 200, 205, n. 12 (1976).

A state water quality standard "shall consist of the designated uses of the navigable waters involved and the water
quality criteria for such waters based upon such uses." 33
U. S. C. $ 1313(c)(2)(A). In setting standards, the State must
comply with the following broad requirements:

"Such standards shall be such as to protect the public
health or welfare, enhance the quality of water and

Opinion of the Court
serve the purposes of this chapter. Such standards
shall be established taking into consideration their use
and value for public water supplies, propagation of fish
and wildlife, recreational [and other purposes.]" Ibid.

See also $ 1251(a)(2).

A 1987 amendment to the Clean Water Act makes clear
that $ 303 also contains an "antidegradation policy"--that is,
a policy requiring that state standards be sufficient to maintain existing beneficial uses of navigable waters, preventing
their further degradation. Specifically, the Act permits the
revision of certain effluent limitations or water quality
standards "only if such revision is subject to and consistent
with the antidegradation policy established under this section." $ 1313(d)(4)(B). Accordingly, EPA's regulations implementing the Act require that state water quality standards include "a statewide antidegradation policy" to ensure
that "[e]xisting instream water uses and the level of water
quality necessary to protect the existing uses shall be maintained and protected." 40 CFR $ 131.12 (1993). At a minimum, state water quality standards must satisfy these conditions. The Act also allows States to impose more stringent
water quality controls. See 33 U. S. C. $$ 1311(b)(1)(C),
1370. See also 40 CFR $ 131.4(a) (1993) ("As recognized by
section 510 of the Clean Water Act[, 33 U. S. C. $ 1370],
States may develop water quality standards more stringent
than required by this regulation").

The State of Washington has adopted comprehensive
water quality standards intended to regulate all of the
State's navigable waters. See Washington Administrative
Code (WAC) 173-201-010 to 173-201-120 (1986). The State
created an inventory of all the State's waters, and divided
the waters into five classes. 173-201-045. Each individual
fresh surface water of the State is placed into one of these
classes. 173-201-080. The Dosewallips River is classified
AA, extraordinary. 173-201-080(32). The water quality

standard for Class AA waters is set forth at 173-201-045(1).The standard identifies the designated uses of Class AA

waters as well as the criteria applicable to such waters.1

1 WAC 173-201-045(1) (1986) provides in pertinent part:
"(1) Class AA (extraordinary).

"(a) General characteristic. Water quality of this class shall markedly
and uniformly exceed the requirements for all or substantially all uses.

"(b) Characteristic uses. Characteristic uses shall include, but not be
limited to, the following:

"(i) Water supply (domestic, industrial, agricultural).
"(ii) Stock watering.
"(iii) Fish and shellfish:
"Salmonid migration, rearing, spawning, and harvesting.
"Other fish migration, rearing, spawning, and harvesting.. . . . .

"(iv) Wildlife habitat.
"(v) Recreation (primary contact recreation, sport fishing, boating, and
aesthetic enjoyment).

"(vi) Commerce and navigation.
"(c) Water quality criteria
"(i) Fecal coliform organisms.
"(A) Freshwater--fecal coliform organisms shall not exceed a geometric
mean value of 50 organisms/100 mL, with not more than 10 percent of
samples exceeding 100 organisms/100 mL.

"(B) Marine water--fecal coliform organisms shall not exceed a geometric mean value of 14 organisms/100 mL, with not more than 10 percent of
samples exceeding 43 organisms/100 mL.

"(ii) Dissolved oxygen [shall exceed specific amounts].. . . . .

"(iii) Total dissolved gas shall not exceed 110 percent of saturation at
any point of sample collection.

"(iv) Temperature shall not exceed [certain levels].. . . . .

"(v) pH shall be within [a specified range].
"(vi) Turbidity shall not exceed [specific levels].
"(vii) Toxic, radioactive, or deleterious material concentrations shall be
less than those which may affect public health, the natural aquatic environment, or the desirability of the water for any use.

"(viii) Aesthetic values shall not be impaired by the presence of materials or their effects, excluding those of natural origin, which offend the
senses of sight, smell, touch, or taste."

707Cite as: 511 U. S. 700 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
In addition to these specific standards applicable to ClassAA waters, the State has adopted a statewide antidegradation policy. That policy provides:

"(a) Existing beneficial uses shall be maintained and
protected and no further degradation which would inter-fere with or become injurious to existing beneficial uses

will be allowed."(b) No degradation will be allowed of waters lying in
national parks, national recreation areas, national wild-life refuges, national scenic rivers, and other areas of
national ecological importance.. . . . .

"(f) In no case, will any degradation of water quality
be allowed if this degradation interferes with orbecomes injurious to existing water uses and causes

long-term and irreparable harm to the environment."173-201-035(8).

As required by the Act, EPA reviewed and approved theState's water quality standards. See 33 U. S. C. $ 1313(c)(3);
42 Fed. Reg. 56792 (1977). Upon approval by EPA, thestate standard became "the water quality standard for the
applicable waters of that State." 33 U. S. C. $ 1313(c)(3).States are responsible for enforcing water quality standards on intrastate waters. $ 1319(a). In addition to these
primary enforcement responsibilities, $ 401 of the Act re-quires States to provide a water quality certification before

a federal license or permit can be issued for activities thatmay result in any discharge into intrastate navigable waters.
33 U. S. C. $ 1341. Specifically, $ 401 requires an applicant
for a federal license or permit to conduct any activity "which
may result in any discharge into the navigable waters" to
obtain from the State a certification "that any such discharge
will comply with the applicable provisions of sections [1311,
1312, 1313, 1316, and 1317 of this title]." 33 U. S. C.

water through turbines to generate electricity and then return the water to the river below the bypass reach. Under
the Federal Power Act (FPA), 41 Stat. 1063, as amended, 16
U. S. C. $ 791a et seq., the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has authority to license new hydroelectric
facilities. As a result, petitioners must get a FERC license
to build or operate the Elkhorn Project. Because a federal
license is required, and because the project may result in
discharges into the Dosewallips River, petitioners are also
required to obtain state certification of the project pursuant
to $ 401 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U. S. C. $ 1341.

The water flow in the bypass reach, which is currently undiminished by appropriation, ranges seasonally between 149
and 738 cubic feet per second (cfs). The Dosewallips supports two species of salmon, coho and chinook, as well as
steelhead trout. As originally proposed, the project was to
include a diversion dam which would completely block the
river and channel approximately 75% of the river's water
into a tunnel alongside the streambed. About 25% of the
water would remain in the bypass reach, but would be returned to the original riverbed through sluice gates or a fish
ladder. Depending on the season, this would leave a residual minimum flow of between 65 and 155 cfs in the river.
Respondent undertook a study to determine the minimum
stream flows necessary to protect the salmon and steelhead
fishery in the bypass reach. On June 11, 1986, respondent
issued a $ 401 water quality certification imposing a variety
of conditions on the project, including a minimum stream
flow requirement of between 100 and 200 cfs depending on
the season.

A state administrative appeals board determined that the
minimum flow requirement was intended to enhance, not
merely maintain, the fishery, and that the certification condition therefore exceeded respondent's authority under
state law. App. to Pet. for Cert. 55a-57a. On appeal, the

29a-45a. The Superior Court also found that respondenthad imposed the minimum flow requirement to protect and
preserve the fishery, not to improve it, and that this require-ment was authorized by state law.

Id., at 34a.The Washington Supreme Court held that the antidegradation provisions of the State's water quality standards re-quire the imposition of minimum stream flows. 121 Wash.
2d 179, 186-187, 849 P. 2d 646, 650 (1993). The court alsofound that $ 401(d), which allows States to impose conditions
based upon several enumerated sections of the Clean WaterAct and "any other appropriate requirement of State law,"
33 U. S. C. $ 1341(d), authorized the stream flow condition.Relying on this language and the broad purposes of the
Clean Water Act, the court concluded that $ 401(d) conferson States power to "consider all state action related to water
quality in imposing conditions on section 401 certificates."121 Wash. 2d, at 192, 849 P. 2d, at 652. We granted certiorari, 510 U. S. 810 (1993), to resolve a conflict among thestate courts of last resort. See 121 Wash. 2d 179, 849 P. 2d
646 (1993); Georgia Pacific Corp. v. Dept. of EnvironmentalConservation, 159 Vt. 639, 628 A. 2d 944 (1992) (table);
Power Authority of New York v. Williams, 60 N. Y. 2d 315,457 N. E. 2d 726 (1983). We now affirm.

III
The principal dispute in this case concerns whether theminimum stream flow requirement that the State imposed

on the Elkhorn Project is a permissible condition of a $ 401certification under the Clean Water Act. To resolve this
dispute we must first determine the scope of the State's au-thority under $ 401. We must then determine whether the
limitation at issue here, the requirement that petitionersmaintain minimum stream flows, falls within the scope of
that authority.

Opinion of the Court

A
There is no dispute that petitioners were required to ob-tain a certification from the State pursuant to $ 401. Petitioners concede that, at a minimum, the project will resultin two possible discharges--the release of dredged and fill
material during the construction of the project, and the dis-charge of water at the end of the tailrace after the water
has been used to generate electricity. Brief for Petitioners27-28. Petitioners contend, however, that the minimum
stream flow requirement imposed by the State was unrelatedto these specific discharges, and that as a consequence, the
State lacked the authority under $ 401 to condition its certi-fication on maintenance of stream flows sufficient to protect
the Dosewallips fishery.If $ 401 consisted solely of subsection (a), which refers to a
state certification that a "discharge" will comply with certainprovisions of the Act, petitioners' assessment of the scope of
the State's certification authority would have considerableforce. Section 401, however, also contains subsection (d),
which expands the State's authority to impose conditions onthe certification of a project. Section 401(d) provides that
any certification shall set forth "any effluent limitations andother limitations . . . necessary to assure that

any applicant"will comply with various provisions of the Act and appropriate state law requirements. 33 U. S. C. $ 1341(d) (empha-sis added). The language of this subsection contradicts petitioners' claim that the State may only impose water qualitylimitations specifically tied to a "discharge." The text refers
to the compliance of the applicant, not the discharge. Sec-tion 401(d) thus allows the State to impose "other limitations" on the project in general to assure compliance withvarious provisions of the Clean Water Act and with "any
other appropriate requirement of State law." Although thedissent asserts that this interpretation of $ 401(d) renders

$ 401(a)(1) superfluous, post, at 726, we see no such anom-aly. Section 401(a)(1) identifies the category of activities

Opinion of the Court

subject to certification--namely, those with discharges. And$ 401(d) is most reasonably read as authorizing additional

conditions and limitations on the activity as a whole once thethreshold condition, the existence of a discharge, is satisfied.

Our view of the statute is consistent with EPA's regulations implementing $ 401. The regulations expressly inter-pret $ 401 as requiring the State to find that "there is a reasonable assurance that the activity will be conducted in amanner which will not violate applicable water quality standards." 40 CFR $ 121.2(a)(3) (1993) (emphasis added). Seealso EPA, Wetlands and 401 Certification 23 (Apr. 1989) ("In
401(d), the Congress has given the States the authority to
place any conditions on a water quality certification that are
necessary to assure that the applicant will comply with effluent limitations, water quality standards, . . . and with `any
other appropriate requirement of State law' "). EPA's conclusion that activities--not merely discharges--must comply
with state water quality standards is a reasonable interpretation of $ 401, and is entitled to deference. See, e. g.,
Arkansas v. Oklahoma, 503 U. S. 91, 110 (1992); Chevron
U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467
U. S. 837 (1984).

Although $ 401(d) authorizes the State to place restrictions
on the activity as a whole, that authority is not unbounded.
The State can only ensure that the project complies with
"any applicable effluent limitations and other limitations,
under [33 U. S. C. $$ 1311, 1312]" or certain other provisions
of the Act, "and with any other appropriate requirement of
State law." 33 U. S. C. $ 1341(d). The State asserts that
the minimum stream flow requirement was imposed to ensure compliance with the state water quality standards
adopted pursuant to $ 303 of the Clean Water Act, 33
U. S. C. $ 1313.

We agree with the State that ensuring compliance with

$ 303 is a proper function of the $ 401 certification. Although

$ 303 is not one of the statutory provisions listed in $ 401(d),

Opinion of the Court
the statute allows States to impose limitations to ensurecompliance with $ 301 of the Act, 33 U. S. C. $ 1311. Section

301 in turn incorporates $ 303 by reference. See 33 U. S. C.$ 1311(b)(1)(C); see also H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 95-830, p. 96
(1977) ("Section 303 is always included by reference wheresection 301 is listed"). As a consequence, state water quality standards adopted pursuant to $ 303 are among the "otherlimitations" with which a State may ensure compliance
through the $ 401 certification process. This interpretationis consistent with EPA's view of the statute. See 40 CFR

$ 121.2(a)(3) (1992); EPA, Wetlands and 401 Certification,
supra. Moreover, limitations to assure compliance withstate water quality standards are also permitted by $ 401(d)'s

reference to "any other appropriate requirement of Statelaw." We do not speculate on what additional state laws,
if any, might be incorporated by this language.3 But at aminimum, limitations imposed pursuant to state water quality standards adopted pursuant to $ 303 are "appropriate"requirements of state law. Indeed, petitioners appear to
agree that the State's authority under $ 401 includes limita-tions designed to ensure compliance with state water quality
standards. Brief for Petitioners 9, 21.

Having concluded that, pursuant to $ 401, States may con-dition certification upon any limitations necessary to ensure

3 The dissent asserts that $ 301 is concerned solely with discharges, not
broader water quality standards. Post, at 730, n. 2. Although $ 301 does
make certain discharges unlawful, see 33 U. S. C. $ 1311(a), it also contains
a broad enabling provision which requires States to take certain actions,
to wit: "In order to carry out the objective of this chapter [viz. the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's water] there shall be
achieved . . . not later than July 1, 1977, any more stringent limitation,
including those necessary to meet water quality standards, . . . established
pursuant to any State law or regulations . . . ." 33 U. S. C. $ 1311(b)(1)(C).
This provision of $ 301 expressly refers to state water quality standards,
and is not limited to discharges.

Opinion of the Court

compliance with state water quality standards or any other"appropriate requirement of State law," we consider whether

the minimum flow condition is such a limitation. Under$ 303, state water quality standards must "consist of the
designated uses of the navigable waters involved and the
water quality criteria for such waters based upon suchuses." 33 U. S. C. $ 1313(c)(2)(A). In imposing the minimum stream flow requirement, the State determined thatconstruction and operation of the project as planned would
be inconsistent with one of the designated uses of Class AAwater, namely "[s]almonid [and other fish] migration, rearing,
spawning, and harvesting." App. to Pet. for Cert. 83a-84a.
The designated use of the river as a fish habitat directly
reflects the Clean Water Act's goal of maintaining the "chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters." 33 U. S. C. $ 1251(a). Indeed, the Act defines pollution as "the man-made or man induced alteration of the
chemical, physical, biological, and radiological integrity of
water." $ 1362(19). Moreover, the Act expressly requires
that, in adopting water quality standards, the State must
take into consideration the use of waters for "propagation of
fish and wildlife." $ 1313(c)(2)(A).

Petitioners assert, however, that $ 303 requires the State
to protect designated uses solely through implementation of
specific "criteria." According to petitioners, the State may
not require them to operate their dam in a manner consistent
with a designated "use"; instead, say petitioners, under $ 303
the State may only require that the project comply with
specific numerical "criteria."

We disagree with petitioners' interpretation of the language of $ 303(c)(2)(A). Under the statute, a water quality
standard must "consist of the designated uses of the navigable waters involved and the water quality criteria for such
waters based upon such uses." 33 U. S. C. $ 1313(c)(2)(A)
(emphasis added). The text makes it plain that water quality standards contain two components. We think the lan511us3$60J 11-04-97 20:17:00 PAGES OPINPGT

715Cite as: 511 U. S. 700 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
guage of $ 303 is most naturally read to require that a projectbe consistent with

both components, namely, the designated
use and the water quality criteria. Accordingly, under theliteral terms of the statute, a project that does not comply

with a designated use of the water does not comply with the
applicable water quality standards.Consequently, pursuant to $ 401(d) the State may require

that a permit applicant comply with both the designated usesand the water quality criteria of the state standards. In
granting certification pursuant to $ 401(d), the State "shallset forth any . . . limitations . . . necessary to assure that [the
applicant] will comply with any . . . limitations under [$ 303]
. . . and with any other appropriate requirement of State
law." A certification requirement that an applicant operate
the project consistently with state water quality standards--
i. e., consistently with the designated uses of the water body
and the water quality criteria--is both a "limitation" to
assure "compl[iance] with . . . limitations" imposed under

$ 303, and an "appropriate" requirement of state law.

EPA has not interpreted $ 303 to require the States to
protect designated uses exclusively through enforcement
of numerical criteria. In its regulations governing state
water quality standards, EPA defines criteria as "elements
of State water quality standards, expressed as constituent
concentrations, levels, or narrative statements, representing
a quality of water that supports a particular use." 40 CFR

$ 131.3(b) (1993) (emphasis added). The regulations further
provide that "[w]hen criteria are met, water quality will generally protect the designated use." Ibid. (emphasis added).
Thus, the EPA regulations implicitly recognize that in some
circumstances, criteria alone are insufficient to protect a designated use.

Petitioners also appear to argue that use requirements are
too open ended, and that the Act only contemplates enforcement of the more specific and objective "criteria." But this
argument is belied by the open-ended nature of the criteria

themselves. As the Solicitor General points out, even "cri-teria" are often expressed in broad, narrative terms, such

as " `there shall be no discharge of toxic pollutants in toxicamounts.' " Brief for United States as

Amicus Curiae
18. See American Paper Institute, Inc. v. EPA, 996 F. 2d
346, 349 (CADC 1993). In fact, under the Clean Water Act,only one class of criteria, those governing "toxic pollutants

listed pursuant to section 1317(a)(1)," need be rendered innumerical form. See 33 U. S. C. $ 1313(c)(2)(B); 40 CFR

$ 131.11(b)(2) (1993).Washington's Class AA water quality standards are typical
in that they contain several open-ended criteria which, like
the use designation of the river as a fishery, must be translated into specific limitations for individual projects. For
example, the standards state that "[t]oxic, radioactive, or deleterious material concentrations shall be less than those which
may affect public health, the natural aquatic environment, or
the desirability of the water for any use." WAC 173-201-
045(1)(c)(vii) (1986). Similarly, the state standards specify
that "[a]esthetic values shall not be impaired by the presence
of materials or their effects, excluding those of natural origin,
which offend the senses of sight, smell, touch, or taste."
173-201-045(1)(c)(viii). We think petitioners' attempt to
distinguish between uses and criteria loses much of its force
in light of the fact that the Act permits enforcement of broad,
narrative criteria based on, for example, "aesthetics."

Petitioners further argue that enforcement of water quality standards through use designations renders the water
quality criteria component of the standards irrelevant. We
see no anomaly, however, in the State's reliance on both use
designations and criteria to protect water quality. The specific numerical limitations embodied in the criteria are a convenient enforcement mechanism for identifying minimum
water conditions which will generally achieve the requisite
water quality. And, in most circumstances, satisfying the
criteria will, as EPA recognizes, be sufficient to maintain the

511us3$60J 11-04-97 20:17:00 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
designated use. See 40 CFR $ 131.3(b) (1993). Water qual-ity standards, however, apply to an entire class of water, a

class which contains numerous individual water bodies. Forexample, in the State of Washington, the Class AA water
quality standard applies to 81 specified fresh surface waters,
as well as to all "surface waters lying within the moun-tainous regions of the state assigned to national parks, national forests, and/or wilderness areas," all "lakes and theirfeeder streams within the state," and all "unclassified surface waters that are tributaries to Class AA waters." WAC173-201-070 (1986). While enforcement of criteria will in
general protect the uses of these diverse waters, a complementary requirement that activities also comport with designated uses enables the States to ensure that each activity--
even if not foreseen by the criteria--will be consistent with
the specific uses and attributes of a particular body of water.

Under petitioners' interpretation of the statute, however,
if a particular criterion, such as turbidity, were missing from
the list contained in an individual state water quality standard, or even if an existing turbidity criterion were insufficient to protect a particular species of fish in a particular
river, the State would nonetheless be forced to allow activities inconsistent with the existing or designated uses. We
think petitioners' reading leads to an unreasonable interpretation of the Act. The criteria components of state water
quality standards attempt to identify, for all the water bodies
in a given class, water quality requirements generally sufficient to protect designated uses. These criteria, however,
cannot reasonably be expected to anticipate all the water
quality issues arising from every activity that can affect the
State's hundreds of individual water bodies. Requiring the
States to enforce only the criteria component of their water
quality standards would in essence require the States to
study to a level of great specificity each individual surface
water to ensure that the criteria applicable to that water are
sufficiently detailed and individualized to fully protect the

Opinion of the Court

water's designated uses. Given that there is no textual sup-port for imposing this requirement, we are loath to attribute

to Congress an intent to impose this heavy regulatory bur-den on the States.

The State also justified its minimum stream flow as necessary to implement the "antidegradation policy" of $ 303, 33U. S. C. $ 1313(d)(4)(B). When the Clean Water Act was

enacted in 1972, the water quality standards of all 50 Stateshad antidegradation provisions. These provisions were required by federal law. See U. S. Dept. of Interior, FederalWater Pollution Control Administration, Compendium of
Department of Interior Statements on Non-degradation of
Interstate Waters 1-2 (Aug. 1968); see also Hines, A Decade
of Nondegradation Policy in Congress and the Courts: The
Erratic Pursuit of Clean Air and Clean Water, 62 Iowa L.
Rev. 643, 658-660 (1977). By providing in 1972 that existing state water quality standards would remain in force
until revised, the Clean Water Act ensured that the States
would continue their antidegradation programs. See 33
U. S. C. $ 1313(a). EPA has consistently required that revised state standards incorporate an antidegradation policy.
And, in 1987, Congress explicitly recognized the existence
of an "antidegradation policy established under [$ 303]."

$ 1313(d)(4)(B).

EPA has promulgated regulations implementing $ 303's
antidegradation policy, a phrase that is not defined elsewhere
in the Act. These regulations require States to "develop
and adopt a statewide antidegradation policy and identify the
methods for implementing such policy." 40 CFR $ 131.12
(1993). These "implementation methods shall, at a minimum, be consistent with the . . . [e]xisting instream water
uses and the level of water quality necessary to protect the
existing uses shall be maintained and protected." Ibid.
EPA has explained that under its antidegradation regulation,
"no activity is allowable . . . which could partially or completely eliminate any existing use." EPA, Questions and

Opinion of the Court
Answers on Antidegradation 3 (Aug. 1985). Thus, Statesmust implement their antidegradation policy in a manner

"consistent" with existing uses of the stream. The State ofWashington's antidegradation policy in turn provides that
"[e]xisting beneficial uses shall be maintained and protected
and no further degradation which would interfere with orbecome injurious to existing beneficial uses will be allowed."

WAC 173-201-035(8)(a) (1986). The State concluded thatthe reduced stream flows would have just the effect prohibited by this policy. The Solicitor General, representingEPA, asserts, Brief for United States as

21, and we agree, that the State's minimum stream flow condition is a proper application of the state and federal antidegradation regulations, as it ensures that an "[e]xisting
instream water us[e]" will be "maintained and protected."
40 CFR $ 131.12(a)(1) (1993).

Petitioners also assert more generally that the Clean
Water Act is only concerned with water "quality," and does
not allow the regulation of water "quantity." This is an artificial distinction. In many cases, water quantity is closely
related to water quality; a sufficient lowering of the water
quantity in a body of water could destroy all of its designated
uses, be it for drinking water, recreation, navigation or, as
here, as a fishery. In any event, there is recognition in the
Clean Water Act itself that reduced stream flow, i. e., diminishment of water quantity, can constitute water pollution.
First, the Act's definition of pollution as "the man-made or
man induced alteration of the chemical, physical, biological,
and radiological integrity of water" encompasses the effects
of reduced water quantity. 33 U. S. C. $ 1362(19). This
broad conception of pollution--one which expressly evinces
Congress' concern with the physical and biological integrity
of water--refutes petitioners' assertion that the Act draws a
sharp distinction between the regulation of water "quantity"
and water "quality." Moreover, $ 304 of the Act expressly
recognizes that water "pollution" may result from "changes

in the movement, flow, or circulation of any navigable waters. . . , including changes caused by the construction of dams."

33 U. S. C. $ 1314(f). This concern with the flowage effectsof dams and other diversions is also embodied in the EPA
regulations, which expressly require existing dams to beoperated to attain designated uses. 40 CFR $ 131.10(g)(4)
(1992).Petitioners assert that two other provisions of the Clean
Water Act, $$ 101(g) and 510(2), 33 U. S. C. $$ 1251(g) and1370(2), exclude the regulation of water quantity from the
coverage of the Act. Section 101(g) provides "that the au-thority of each State to allocate quantities of water within its
jurisdiction shall not be superseded, abrogated or otherwiseimpaired by this chapter." 33 U. S. C. $ 1251(g). Similarly,

$ 510(2) provides that nothing in the Act shall "be construedas impairing or in any manner affecting any right or jurisdiction of the States with respect to the waters . . . of suchStates." 33 U. S. C. $ 1370. In petitioners' view, these provisions exclude "water quantity issues from direct regula-tion under the federally controlled water quality standards
authorized in $ 303." Brief for Petitioners 39 (emphasisdeleted).

This language gives the States authority to allocate waterrights; we therefore find it peculiar that petitioners argue
that it prevents the State from regulating stream flow. Inany event, we read these provisions more narrowly than
petitioners. Sections 101(g) and 510(2) preserve the author-ity of each State to allocate water quantity as between users;
they do not limit the scope of water pollution controls thatmay be imposed on users who have obtained, pursuant to
state law, a water allocation. In California v. FERC, 495U. S. 490, 498 (1990), construing an analogous provision of
the Federal Power Act,4 we explained that "minimum stream

flow requirements neither reflect nor establish `proprietary
rights' " to water. Cf. First Iowa Hydro-Electric Cooperative v. FPC, 328 U. S. 152, 176, and n. 20 (1946). Moreover,
the certification itself does not purport to determine petitioners' proprietary right to the water of the Dosewallips.
In fact, the certification expressly states that a "State Water
Right Permit (Chapters 90.03.250 RCW and 508-12 WAC)
must be obtained prior to commencing construction of the
project." App. to Pet. for Cert. 83a. The certification
merely determines the nature of the use to which that proprietary right may be put under the Clean Water Act, if and
when it is obtained from the State. Our view is reinforced
by the legislative history of the 1977 amendment to the
Clean Water Act adding $ 101(g). See 3 Legislative History
of the Clean Water Act of 1977 (Committee Print compiled
for the Committee on Environment and Public Works by the
Library of Congress), Ser. No. 95-14, p. 532 (1978) ("The requirements [of the Act] may incidentally affect individual
water rights. . . . It is not the purpose of this amendment to
prohibit those incidental effects. It is the purpose of this
amendment to insure that State allocation systems are not
subverted, and that effects on individual rights, if any,
are prompted by legitimate and necessary water quality
considerations").

Petitioners contend that we should limit the State's authority to impose minimum flow requirements because
FERC has comprehensive authority to license hydroelectric
projects pursuant to the FPA, 16 U. S. C. $ 791a et seq. In
petitioners' view, the minimum flow requirement imposed
here interferes with FERC's authority under the FPA.

Opinion of the Court

The FPA empowers FERC to issue licenses for projects
"necessary or convenient . . . for the development, transmission, and utilization of power across, along, from, or in any
of the streams . . . over which Congress has jurisdiction."

$ 797(e). The FPA also requires FERC to consider a project's effect on fish and wildlife. $$ 797(e), 803(a)(1). In California v. FERC, supra, we held that the California Water
Resources Control Board, acting pursuant to state law, could
not impose a minimum stream flow which conflicted with
minimum stream flows contained in a FERC license. We
concluded that the FPA did not "save" to the States this
authority. Id., at 498.

No such conflict with any FERC licensing activity is presented here. FERC has not yet acted on petitioners' license
application, and it is possible that FERC will eventually
deny petitioners' application altogether. Alternatively, it is
quite possible, given that FERC is required to give equal
consideration to the protection of fish habitat when deciding
whether to issue a license, that any FERC license would contain the same conditions as the state $ 401 certification. Indeed, at oral argument the Deputy Solicitor General stated
that both EPA and FERC were represented in this proceeding, and that the Government has no objection to the stream
flow condition contained in the $ 401 certification. Tr. of
Oral Arg. 43-44.

Finally, the requirement for a state certification applies
not only to applications for licenses from FERC, but to all
federal licenses and permits for activities which may result
in a discharge into the Nation's navigable waters. For example, a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers is required for the installation of any structure in the navigable
waters which may interfere with navigation, including piers,
docks, and ramps. Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act
of 1899, 30 Stat. 1151, $ 10, 33 U. S. C. $ 403. Similarly, a
permit must be obtained from the Army Corps of Engineers

for the discharge of dredged or fill material, and from the
Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture for the construction
of reservoirs, canals, and other water storage systems on federal land. See 33 U. S. C. $$ 1344(a), (e); 43 U. S. C. $ 1761
(1988 ed. and Supp. IV). We assume that a $ 401 certification would also be required for some licenses obtained pursuant to these statutes. Because $ 401's certification requirement applies to other statutes and regulatory schemes, and
because any conflict with FERC's authority under the FPA
is hypothetical, we are unwilling to read implied limitations
into $ 401. If FERC issues a license containing a stream
flow condition with which petitioners disagree, they may
pursue judicial remedies at that time. Cf. Escondido Mut.
Water Co. v. La Jolla Band of Mission Indians, 466 U. S.
765, 778, n. 20 (1984).

In summary, we hold that the State may include minimum
stream flow requirements in a certification issued pursuant
to $ 401 of the Clean Water Act insofar as necessary to enforce a designated use contained in a state water quality
standard. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington, accordingly, is affirmed.

So ordered.

Justice Stevens, concurring.
While I agree fully with the thorough analysis in the
Court's opinion, I add this comment for emphasis. For
judges who find it unnecessary to go behind the statutory
text to discern the intent of Congress, this is (or should be)
an easy case. Not a single sentence, phrase, or word in the
Clean Water Act purports to place any constraint on a State's
power to regulate the quality of its own waters more stringently than federal law might require. In fact, the Act explicitly recognizes States' ability to impose stricter standards. See, e. g., $ 301(b)(1)(C), 33 U. S. C. $ 1311(b)(1)(C).

Thomas, J., dissenting

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins,dissenting.

The Court today holds that a State, pursuant to $ 401 ofthe Clean Water Act, may condition the certification necessary to obtain a federal license for a proposed hydroelectricproject upon the maintenance of a minimum flow rate in the
river to be utilized by the project. In my view, the Courtmakes three fundamental errors. First, it adopts an interpretation that fails adequately to harmonize the subsectionsof $ 401. Second, it places no meaningful limitation on a
State's authority under $ 401 to impose conditions on certifi-cation. Third, it gives little or no consideration to the fact
that its interpretation of $ 401 will significantly disrupt thecarefully crafted federal-state balance embodied in the Federal Power Act. Accordingly, I dissent.

A
Section 401(a)(1) of the Federal Water Pollution ControlAct, otherwise known as the Clean Water Act (CWA or Act),

33 U. S. C. $ 1251 et seq., provides that "[a]ny applicant for aFederal license or permit to conduct any activity . . . , which
may result in any discharge into the navigable waters, shallprovide the licensing or permitting agency a certification
from the State in which the discharge originates . . . that anysuch discharge will comply with . . . applicable provisions
of [the CWA]." 33 U. S. C. $ 1341(a)(1). The terms of$ 401(a)(1) make clear that the purpose of the certification
process is to ensure that discharges from a project will meetthe requirements of the CWA. Indeed, a State's authority
under $ 401(a)(1) is limited to certifying that "any discharge"that "may result" from "any activity," such as petitioners'
proposed hydroelectric project, will "comply" with the enu-merated provisions of the CWA; if the discharge will fail to
comply, the State may "den[y]" the certification. Ibid. Inaddition, under $ 401(d), a State may place conditions on a

$ 401 certification, including "effluent limitations and otherlimitations, and monitoring requirements," that may be necessary to ensure compliance with various provisions of theCWA and with "any other appropriate requirement of State
law." $ 1341(d).The minimum stream flow condition imposed by respondents in this case has no relation to any possible "discharge"that might "result" from petitioners' proposed project. The
term "discharge" is not defined in the CWA, but its plainand ordinary meaning suggests "a flowing or issuing out," or
"something that is emitted." Webster's Ninth New Colle-giate Dictionary 360 (1991). Cf. 33 U. S. C. $ 1362(16) ("The
term `discharge' when used without qualification includes adischarge of a pollutant, and a discharge of pollutants"). A
minimum stream flow requirement, by contrast, is a limita-tion on the amount of water the project can take in or divert
from the river. See ante, at 709. That is, a minimumstream flow requirement is a limitation on intake--the opposite of discharge. Imposition of such a requirement wouldthus appear to be beyond a State's authority as it is defined
by $ 401(a)(1).The Court remarks that this reading of $ 401(a)(1) would
have "considerable force," ante, at 711, were it not for whatthe Court understands to be the expansive terms of $ 401(d).
That subsection, as set forth in 33 U. S. C. $ 1341(d), provides:

"Any certification provided under this section shall setforth any effluent limitations and other limitations, and

monitoring requirements necessary to assure that anyapplicant for a Federal license or permit will comply
with any applicable effluent limitations and other limita-tions, under section 1311 or 1312 of this title, standard
of performance under section 1316 of this title, or pro-hibition, effluent standard, or pretreatment standard
under section 1317 of this title, and with any otherappropriate requirement of State law set forth in such
certification, and shall become a condition on any Fed511us3$60N 11-04-97 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT

eral license or permit subject to the provisions of thissection." (Emphasis added.)

According to the Court, the fact that $ 401(d) refers to an"applicant," rather than a "discharge," complying with various provisions of the Act "contradicts petitioners' claim thatthe State may only impose water quality limitations specifically tied to a `discharge.' " Ante, at 711. In the Court'sview, $ 401(d)'s reference to an applicant's compliance "expands" a State's authority beyond the limits set out in$ 401(a)(1),

ibid., thereby permitting the State in its certifi-cation process to scrutinize the applicant's proposed "activity

as a whole," not just the discharges that may result from theactivity, ante, at 712. The Court concludes that this broader
authority allows a State to impose conditions on a $ 401 certi-fication that are unrelated to discharges. Ante, at 711-712.

While the Court's interpretation seems plausible at firstglance, it ultimately must fail. If, as the Court asserts,

$ 401(d) permits States to impose conditions unrelated to dis-charges in $ 401 certifications, Congress' careful focus on discharges in $ 401(a)(1)--the provision that describes the scopeand function of the certification process--was wasted effort.
The power to set conditions that are unrelated to dischargesis, of course, nothing but a conditional power to deny certification for reasons unrelated to discharges. PermittingStates to impose conditions unrelated to discharges, then,
effectively eliminates the constraints of $ 401(a)(1).Subsections 401(a)(1) and (d) can easily be reconciled to
avoid this problem. To ascertain the nature of the condi-tions permissible under $ 401(d), $ 401 must be read as a
whole. See United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood
Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988) (statutoryinterpretation is a "holistic endeavor"). As noted above,

$ 401(a)(1) limits a State's authority in the certification proc-ess to addressing concerns related to discharges and to
ensuring that any discharge resulting from a project willcomply with specified provisions of the Act. It is reasonable

Thomas, J., dissenting
to infer that the conditions a State is permitted to impose on
certification must relate to the very purpose the certification
process is designed to serve. Thus, while $ 401(d) permits a
State to place conditions on a certification to ensure compliance of the "applicant," those conditions must still be related
to discharges. In my view, this interpretation best harmonizes the subsections of $ 401. Indeed, any broader interpretation of $ 401(d) would permit that subsection to swallow $ 401(a)(1).

The text of $ 401(d) similarly suggests that the conditions
it authorizes must be related to discharges. The Court attaches critical weight to the fact that $ 401(d) speaks of the
compliance of an "applicant," but that reference, in and of
itself, says little about the nature of the conditions that may
be imposed under $ 401(d). Rather, because $ 401(d) conditions can be imposed only to ensure compliance with specified provisions of law--that is, with "applicable effluent limitations and other limitations, under section 1311 or 1312 of
this title, standard[s] of performance under section 1316 of
this title, . . . prohibition[s], effluent standard[s], or pretreatment standard[s] under section 1317 of this title, [or] . . . any
other appropriate requirement[s] of State law"--one should
logically turn to those provisions for guidance in determining
the nature, scope, and purpose of $ 401(d) conditions. Each
of the four identified CWA provisions describes dischargerelated limitations. See $ 1311 (making it unlawful to discharge any pollutant except in compliance with enumerated
provisions of the Act); $ 1312 (establishing effluent limitations on point source discharges); $ 1316 (setting national
standards of performance for the control of discharges); and

$ 1317 (setting pretreatment effluent standards and prohibiting the discharge of certain effluents except in compliance
with standards).

The final term on the list--"appropriate requirement[s] of
State law"--appears to be more general in scope. Because

this reference follows a list of more limited provisions that
specifically address discharges, however, the principle ejusdem generis would suggest that the general reference to
"appropriate" requirements of state law is most reasonably
construed to extend only to provisions that, like the other
provisions in the list, impose discharge-related restrictions.
Cf. Cleveland v. United States, 329 U. S. 14, 18 (1946)
("Under the ejusdem generis rule of construction the general words are confined to the class and may not be used
to enlarge it"); Arcadia v. Ohio Power Co., 498 U. S. 73, 84
(1990). In sum, the text and structure of $ 401 indicate
that a State may impose under $ 401(d) only those conditions
that are related to discharges.

B
The Court adopts its expansive reading of $ 401(d) based
at least in part upon deference to the "conclusion" of the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that $ 401(d) is not
limited to requirements relating to discharges. Ante, at
712. The agency regulation to which the Court defers is 40
CFR $ 121.2(a)(3) (1993), which provides that the certification shall contain "[a] statement that there is a reasonable
assurance that the activity will be conducted in a manner
which will not violate applicable water quality standards."
Ante, at 712. According to the Court, "EPA's conclusion
that activities--not merely discharges--must comply with
state water quality standards . . . is entitled to deference"
under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense
Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984). Ante, at 712.

As a preliminary matter, the Court appears to resort to
deference under Chevron without establishing through an
initial examination of the statute that the text of the section
is ambiguous. See Chevron, supra, at 842-843. More importantly, the Court invokes Chevron deference to support
its interpretation even though the Government does not seek

deference for the EPA's regulation in this case.1 That theGovernment itself has not contended that an agency interpretation exists reconciling the scope of the conditioning au-thority under $ 401(d) with the terms of $ 401(a)(1) should
suggest to the Court that there is no "agenc[y] construction"directly addressing the question.

Chevron, supra, at 842.In fact, the regulation to which the Court defers is hardly

a definitive construction of the scope of $ 401(d). On the con-trary, the EPA's position on the question whether conditions
under $ 401(d) must be related to discharges is far from clear.Indeed, the only EPA regulation that specifically addresses
the "conditions" that may appear in $ 401 certificationsspeaks exclusively in terms of limiting discharges. According to the EPA, a $ 401 certification shall contain "[a] state-ment

of any conditions which the certifying agency deemsnecessary or desirable with respect to the discharge of the

activity." 40 CFR $ 121.2(a)(4) (1993) (emphases added).In my view, $ 121.2(a)(4) should, at the very least, give the
Court pause before it resorts to Chevron deference in thiscase.

II
The Washington Supreme Court held that the State'swater quality standards, promulgated pursuant to $ 303 of

the Act, 33 U. S. C. $ 1313, were "appropriate" requirementsof state law under $ 401(d), and sustained the stream flow
condition imposed by respondents as necessary to ensurecompliance with a "use" of the river as specified in those
standards. As an alternative to their argument that $ 401(d)conditions must be discharge related, petitioners assert that

1 The Government, appearing as amicus curiae "supporting affirmance,"
instead approaches the question presented by assuming, arguendo, that
petitioners' construction of $ 401 is correct: "Even if a condition imposed
under Section 401(d) were valid only if it assured that a `discharge' will
comply with the State's water quality standards, the [minimum flow condition set by respondents] satisfies that test." Brief for United States as

Thomas, J., dissenting

the state court erred when it sustained the stream flow con-dition under the "use" component of the State's water quality

standards without reference to the corresponding "waterquality criteria" contained in those standards. As explained
above, petitioners' argument with regard to the scope of aState's authority to impose conditions under $ 401(d) is correct. I also find petitioners' alternative argument persua-sive. Not only does the Court err in rejecting that $ 303
argument, in the process of doing so it essentially removesall limitations on a State's conditioning authority under $ 401.

The Court states that, "at a minimum, limitations imposedpursuant to state water quality standards adopted pursuant
to $ 303 are `appropriate' requirements of state law" under$ 401(d). Ante, at 713.

2 A water quality standard promulgated pursuant to $ 303 must "consist of the designated usesof the navigable waters involved and the water quality criteria for such waters based upon such uses." 33 U. S. C.$ 1313(c)(2)(A). The Court asserts that this language "is
most naturally read to require that a project be consistentwith both components, namely, the designated use and the
water quality criteria." Ante, at 715. In the Court's view,then, the "use" of a body of water is independently enforceable through $ 401(d) without reference to the correspondingcriteria.

Ibid.The Court's reading strikes me as contrary to common

sense. It is difficult to see how compliance with a "use" ofa body of water could be enforced without reference to the

2 In the Court's view, $ 303 water quality standards come into play under

$ 401(d) either as "appropriate" requirements of state law or through $ 301
of the Act, which, according to the Court, "incorporates $ 303 by reference." Ante, at 713 (citations omitted). The Court notes that through

$ 303, "the statute allows States to impose limitations to ensure compliance with $ 301 of the Act." Ibid. Yet $ 301 makes unlawful only "the
[unauthorized] discharge of any pollutant by any person." 33 U. S. C.

$ 1311(a) (emphasis added); cf. supra, at 727. Thus, the Court's reliance
on $ 301 as a source of authority to impose conditions unrelated to discharges is misplaced.

corresponding criteria. In this case, for example, the appli-cable "use" is contained in the following regulation: "Characteristic uses shall include, but not be limited to, . . . [s]almo-nid migration, rearing, spawning, and harvesting." Wash.
Admin. Code (WAC) 173-201-045(1)(b)(iii) (1986). The cor-responding criteria, by contrast, include measurable factors
such as quantities of fecal coliform organisms and dissolvedgases in the water. 173-201-045(1)(c)(i) and (ii).

3 Although

the Act does not further address (at least not expressly) thelink between "uses" and "criteria," the regulations promulgated under $ 303 make clear that a "use" is an aspirationalgoal to be attained through compliance with corresponding
"criteria." Those regulations suggest that "uses" are to be"achieved and protected," and that "water quality criteria"
are to be adopted to "protect the designated use[s]." 40CFR $$ 131.10(a), 131.11(a)(1) (1993).

The problematic consequences of decoupling "uses" and"criteria" become clear once the Court's interpretation of

$ 303 is read in the context of $ 401. In the Court's view, aState may condition the $ 401 certification "upon any limitations necessary to ensure compliance" with the "uses ofthe water body."

Ante, at 713-714, 715 (emphasis added).Under the Court's interpretation, then, state environmental

agencies may pursue, through $ 401, their water goals in anyway they choose; the conditions imposed on certifications
need not relate to discharges, nor to water quality criteria,nor to any objective or quantifiable standard, so long as they
tend to make the water more suitable for the uses the Statehas chosen. In short, once a State is allowed to impose conditions on $ 401 certifications to protect "uses" in the ab-stract, $ 401(d) is limitless.

To illustrate, while respondents in this case focused onlyon the "use" of the Dosewallips River as a fish habitat, this
particular river has a number of other "[c]haracteristic uses,"

3 Respondents concede that petitioners' project "will likely not violate
any of Washington's water quality criteria." Brief for Respondents 24.

including "[r]ecreation (primary contact recreation, sportfishing, boating, and aesthetic enjoyment)." WAC 173-201-

045(1)(b)(v) (1986). Under the Court's interpretation, re-spondents could have imposed any number of conditions
related to recreation, including conditions that have littlerelation to water quality. In

Town of Summersville, 60FERC || 61,291, p. 61,990 (1992), for instance, the state

agency required the applicant to "construct . . . access roadsand paths, low water stepping stone bridges, . . . a boat
launching facility . . . , and a residence and storage building."These conditions presumably would be sustained under the
approach the Court adopts today.4 In the end, it is difficultto conceive of a condition that would fall outside a State's

$ 401(d) authority under the Court's approach.

III
The Court's interpretation of $ 401 significantly disruptsthe careful balance between state and federal interests that

Congress struck in the Federal Power Act (FPA), 16 U. S. C.$ 791 et seq. Section 4(e) of the FPA authorizes the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to issue licenses forprojects "necessary or convenient . . . for the development,
transmission, and utilization of power across, along, from, orin any of the streams . . . over which Congress has jurisdiction." 16 U. S. C. $ 797(e). In the licensing process, FERCmust balance a number of considerations: "[I]n addition to
the power and development purposes for which licenses areissued, [FERC] shall give equal consideration to the purposes of energy conservation, the protection, mitigation ofdamage to, and enhancement of, fish and wildlife (including
related spawning grounds and habitat), the protection of rec4 Indeed, as the $ 401 certification stated in this case, the flow levels
imposed by respondents are "in excess of those required to maintain water
quality in the bypass region," App. to Pet. for Cert. 83a, and therefore
conditions not related to water quality must, in the Court's view, be
permitted.

reational opportunities, and the preservation of other aspectsof environmental quality."

Ibid. Section 10(a) empowers
FERC to impose on a license such conditions, including mini-mum stream flow requirements, as it deems best suited for

power development and other public uses of the waters.
See 16 U. S. C. $ 803(a); California v. FERC, 495 U. S. 490,494-495, 506 (1990).

In California v. FERC, the Court emphasized FERC's ex-clusive authority to set the stream flow levels to be maintained by federally licensed hydroelectric projects. Califor-nia, in order "to protect [a] stream's fish," had imposed flow
rates on a federally licensed project that were significantlyhigher than the flow rates established by FERC.

Id., at 493.
In concluding that California lacked authority to impose such
flow rates, we stated:

"As Congress directed in FPA $ 10(a), FERC set theconditions of the [project] license, including the minimum stream flow, after considering which requirements
would best protect wildlife and ensure that the projectwould be economically feasible, and thus further power

development. Allowing California to impose signifi-cantly higher minimum stream flow requirements would
disturb and conflict with the balance embodied in thatconsidered federal agency determination. FERC has
indicated that the California requirements interferewith its comprehensive planning authority, and we agree
that allowing California to impose the challenged requirements would be contrary to congressional intentregarding the Commission's licensing authority and

would constitute a veto of the project that was approved
and licensed by FERC." Id., at 506-507 (citations and
internal quotation marks omitted).

a veto power" over federal hydroelectric projects. Such au-thority, we concluded, could "destroy the effectiveness" of

the FPA and "subordinate to the control of the State the`comprehensive' planning" with which the administering
federal agency (at that time the Federal Power Commission)was charged.

Ibid.Today, the Court gives the States precisely the veto power

over hydroelectric projects that we determined in Califor-nia v. FERC and First Iowa they did not possess. As the
language of $ 401(d) expressly states, any condition placed ina $ 401 certification, including, in the Court's view, a stream
flow requirement, "shall become a condition on any Federallicense or permit." 33 U. S. C. $ 1341(d) (emphasis added).
Any condition imposed by a State under $ 401(d) thus be-comes a "ter[m] . . . of the license as a matter of law,"

Depart-ment of Interior v. FERC, 952 F. 2d 538, 548 (CADC 1992)

(citation and internal quotation marks omitted), regardless ofwhether FERC favors the limitation. Because of $ 401(d)'s
mandatory language, federal courts have uniformly held thatFERC has no power to alter or review $ 401 conditions, and
that the proper forum for review of those conditions is statecourt.

5 Section 401(d) conditions imposed by States are

5 See, e. g., Keating v. FERC, 927 F. 2d 616, 622 (CADC 1991) (federal
review inappropriate because a decision to grant or deny $ 401 certification

an area that Congress expressly intended to reserve to the states and
concerning which federal agencies have little competence"); Department

F. 2d 1007, 1009 (CA3 1988). FERC has taken a similar position. See

therefore binding on FERC. Under the Court's interpreta-tion, then, it appears that the mistake of the State in

California v. FERC was not that it had trespassed into terri-tory exclusively reserved to FERC; rather, it simply had not

hit upon the proper device--that is, the $ 401 certification--
through which to achieve its objectives.Although the Court notes in passing that "[t]he limitations

included in the certification become a condition on any fed-eral license,"

ante, at 708, it does not acknowledge or discuss
the shift of power from FERC to the States that is accom-plished by its decision. Indeed, the Court merely notes that

"any conflict with FERC's authority under the FPA" in this
case is "hypothetical" at this stage, ante, at 723, because
"FERC has not yet acted on petitioners' license application,"
ante, at 722. We are assured that "it is quite possible . . .
that any FERC license would contain the same conditions as
the state $ 401 certification." Ibid.

The Court's observations simply miss the point. Even if
FERC might have no objection to the stream flow condition
established by respondents in this case, such a happy coincidence will likely prove to be the exception, rather than the
rule. In issuing licenses, FERC must balance the Nation's
power needs together with the need for energy conservation,
irrigation, flood control, fish and wildlife protection, and recreation. 16 U. S. C. $ 797(e). State environmental agencies,
by contrast, need only consider parochial environmental interests. Cf., e. g., Wash. Rev. Code $ 90.54.010(2) (1992) (goal
of State's water policy is to "insure that waters of the state
are protected and fully utilized for the greatest benefit to
the people of the state of Washington"). As a result, it is
likely that conflicts will arise between a FERC-established
stream flow level and a state-imposed level.

Moreover, the Court ignores the fact that its decision nullifies the congressionally mandated process for resolving such
state-federal disputes when they develop. Section 10( j)(1)

of the Electric Consumers Protection Act of 1986 (ECPA),100 Stat. 1244, provides that every FERC license must include conditions to "protect, mitigate damag[e] to, and en-hance" fish and wildlife, including "related spawning grounds
and habitat," and that such conditions "shall be based on recommendations" received from various agencies, includingstate fish and wildlife agencies. If FERC believes that a

recommendation from a state agency is inconsistent with theFPA--that is, inconsistent with what FERC views as the
proper balance between the Nation's power needs and envi-ronmental concerns--it must "attempt to resolve any such
inconsistency, giving due weight to the recommendations, expertise, and statutory responsibilities" of the state agency.

$ 803( j)(2). If, after such an attempt, FERC "does not adopt
in whole or in part a recommendation of any [state] agency,"
it must publish its reasons for rejecting that recommendation. Ibid. After today's decision, these procedures are a
dead letter with regard to stream flow levels, because a
State's "recommendation" concerning stream flow "shall" be
included in the license when it is imposed as a condition
under $ 401(d).

More fundamentally, the 1986 amendments to the FPA
simply make no sense in the stream flow context if, in fact,
the States already possessed the authority to establish minimum stream flow levels under $ 401(d) of the CWA, which
was enacted years before those amendments. Through the
ECPA, Congress strengthened the role of the States in
establishing FERC conditions, but it did not make that authority paramount. Indeed, although Congress could have
vested in the States the final authority to set stream flow
conditions, it instead left that authority with FERC. See
California v. FERC, 495 U. S., at 499. As the Ninth Circuit
observed in the course of rejecting California's effort to give
California v. FERC a narrow reading, "[t]here would be no
point in Congress requiring [FERC] to consider the state

Given the connection between $ 401 and federal hydroelec-tric licensing, it is remarkable that the Court does not at
least attempt to fit its interpretation of $ 401 into the largerstatutory framework governing the licensing process. At
the very least, the significant impact the Court's ruling islikely to have on that process should compel the Court to
undertake a closer examination of $ 401 to ensure that theresult it reaches was mandated by Congress.

Because the Court today fundamentally alters thefederal-state balance Congress carefully crafted in the FPA,

and because such a result is neither mandated nor supportedby the text of $ 401, I respectfully dissent.

NICHOLS v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 92-8556. Argued January 10, 1994--Decided June 6, 1994
After petitioner Nichols pleaded guilty to federal felony drug charges, he

was assessed criminal history points under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, including one point for a state misdemeanor conviction
for driving while under the influence (DUI), for which he was fined
but not incarcerated. That point increased the maximum sentence of
imprisonment from 210 to 235 months. Petitioner objected to the inclusion of his DUI conviction, arguing that because he had not been represented by counsel in that proceeding, considering it in establishing his
sentence would violate the Sixth Amendment as construed in Baldasar
v. Illinois, 446 U. S. 222. However, the District Court reasoned that
Baldasar lacked a majority opinion and thus stood only for the proposition that a prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction may not be used
to create a felony with a prison term. Since petitioner's offense was
already defined as a felony, the court ruled that Baldasar was inapplicable and sentenced petitioner to a term of imprisonment 25 months
longer than it could have been had the DUI conviction not been considered. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: Consistent with the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, a sentencing court may consider a defendant's previous uncounseled misdemeanor
conviction in sentencing him for a subsequent offense so long as the
previous uncounseled misdemeanor conviction did not result in a sentence of imprisonment. Pp. 743-749.

(a) A year after this Court decided that a defendant charged with a
misdemeanor has no constitutional right to counsel where no sentence
of imprisonment is imposed, Scott v. Illinois, 440 U. S. 367, a majority
of the Court held in Baldasar that a prior uncounseled misdemeanor
conviction, constitutional under Scott, could not be collaterally used to
convert a second misdemeanor conviction into a felony under the applicable Illinois sentencing enhancement statute. However, that per
curiam opinion provided no rationale for its result, referring instead
to three different concurring opinions to support the judgment. This
splintered decision has created great confusion in the lower courts.
Pp. 743-746.

(b) Five Members of the Baldasar Court expressed continued adherence to Scott. This Court adheres to that holding today, but agrees

with the dissent in Baldasar that a logical consequence of the holding
is that an uncounseled conviction valid under Scott may be relied upon
to enhance the sentence for a subsequent offense, even though that sentence entails imprisonment. Enhancement statutes do not change the
penalty imposed for the earlier conviction. Reliance on the earlier conviction is also consistent with the traditional understanding of the sentencing process, which is less exacting than the process of establishing
guilt. It is constitutional to consider a defendant's past criminal conduct when sentencing, even if no conviction resulted from that behavior,
and the state need prove such conduct only by a preponderance of the
evidence. McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 91. Thus, it must
be constitutionally permissible to consider a prior misdemeanor conviction based on the same conduct where that conduct is subject to proof
beyond a reasonable doubt. Petitioner's due process contention that a
misdemeanor defendant must be warned that his conviction might be
used in the future for enhancement purposes is rejected. Such convictions often take place in police or justice courts, which are not courts
of record, and thus there may be no way to memorialize any such warning; and it is unclear how expansive the warning would have to be.

740 NICHOLS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

In this case, we return to the issue that splintered theCourt in Baldasar v. Illinois, 446 U. S. 222 (1980): Whether
the Constitution prohibits a sentencing court from consider-ing a defendant's previous uncounseled misdemeanor conviction in sentencing him for a subsequent offense.In 1990, petitioner Nichols pleaded guilty to conspiracy to
possess cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21U. S. C. $ 846. Pursuant to the United States Sentencing
Commission's Guidelines (Sentencing Guidelines), petitionerwas assessed three criminal history points for a 1983 federal
felony drug conviction. An additional criminal history pointwas assessed for petitioner's 1983 state misdemeanor conviction for driving under the influence (DUI), for which peti-tioner was fined $250 but was not incarcerated.

1 This additional criminal history point increased petitioner's CriminalHistory Category from Category II to Category III.

2 As a

result, petitioner's sentencing range under the SentencingGuidelines increased from 168-210 months (under Criminal

History Category II) to 188-235 months (under CategoryIII).

3

1 At the time of his conviction, petitioner faced a maximum punishment
of one year imprisonment and a $1,000 fine. Georgia law provided that a
person convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol "shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than ten days nor more than one year, or by a fine
of not less than $100.00 nor more than $1,000.00, or by both such fine and
imprisonment." Ga. Code Ann. $ 40.6-391(c) (1982).

2 There are six criminal history categories under the Sentencing Guidelines. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (USSG)
ch. 5, pt. A (Nov. 1993) (Sentencing Table). A defendant's criminal history
category is determined by the number of his criminal history points, which
in turn is based on his prior criminal record. Id., ch. 4, p. A.

3 The Sentencing Table provides a matrix of sentencing ranges. On the

vertical axis of the matrix is the defendant's offense level representing the
seriousness of the crime; on the horizontal axis is the defendant's criminal
history category. The sentencing range is determined by identifying the

Opinion of the Court
Petitioner objected to the inclusion of his DUI misde-meanor conviction in his criminal history score because he

was not represented by counsel at that proceeding. Hemaintained that consideration of that uncounseled misdemeanor conviction in establishing his sentence would violate
the Sixth Amendment as construed in Baldasar, supra.The United States District Court for the Eastern District of

Tennessee found that petitioner's misdemeanor convictionwas uncounseled and that, based on the record before it, petitioner had not waived his right to counsel.4 763 F. Supp.277 (1991). But the District Court rejected petitioner's

Baldasar argument, explaining that in the absence of a majorityopinion,

Baldasar "stands only for the proposition that a
prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction may not be usedto create a felony with a prison term." 763 F. Supp., at 279.

Because petitioner's offense was already defined as a felony,
the District Court ruled that Baldasar was inapplicable to
the facts of this case; thus, petitioner's constitutional rights
were not violated by using his 1983 DUI conviction to enhance his sentence.5 It sentenced petitioner to the maximum term allowed by the Sentencing Guidelines under its
interpretation of Baldasar, a term 25 months longer than
if the misdemeanor conviction had not been considered in
calculating petitioner's criminal history score.

intersection of the defendant's offense level and his criminal history category. Id., ch. 5, pt. A (Sentencing Table).

4 The Government contends that, even if Baldasar v. Illinois, 446 U. S.

222 (1980), prohibits using the prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction
to enhance petitioner's sentence, the District Court applied the wrong legal
standard in finding no valid waiver of the right to counsel. Based on Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 467-469 (1938), and Parke v. Raley, 506 U. S.
20, 28-29 (1992), the Government argues that petitioner failed to carry
his burden to establish the absence of a valid waiver of counsel. We need
not address this contention due to our resolution of the Baldasar issue.

5 Petitioner's instant felony conviction was punishable under statute by

not less than 10 years' imprisonment and not more than life imprisonment.

742 NICHOLS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Cir-cuit affirmed. 979 F. 2d 402 (1992). After reviewing the

fractured decision in Baldasar and the opinions from otherCourts of Appeals that had considered the issue, the court
held that Baldasar limits the collateral use at sentencing ofa prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction only when the
effect of such consideration is to convert a misdemeanor intoa felony.

6 The dissent, while recognizing that "numerous

courts have questioned whether [Baldasar] expresses anysingle holding, and, accordingly, have largely limited

Bal-dasar to its facts," nevertheless concluded that Baldasar

proscribed the use of petitioner's prior uncounseled DUIconviction to enhance his sentence under the Sentencing
Guidelines. 979 F. 2d, at 407-408 (citations omitted).We granted certiorari, 509 U. S. 953 (1993), to address this
important question of Sixth Amendment law, and to therebyresolve a conflict among state courts

7 as well as Federal

Courts of Appeals.8 We now affirm.

6 The court also stated that its decision was "logically compelled" by

may be used for impeachment purposes' ").

essentially limiting Baldasar to its facts. See Wilson v. Estelle, 625 F. 2d
1158, 1159, and n. 1 (CA5 1980) (a prior uncounseled misdemeanor convic511us3$61H 11-04-97 20:25:22 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
In Scott v. Illinois, 440 U. S. 367 (1979), we held that whereno sentence of imprisonment was imposed, a defendant

charged with a misdemeanor had no constitutional right tocounsel.

9 Our decision in Scott was dictated by Argersinger

v. Hamlin, 407 U. S. 25 (1972), but we stated that "[e]venwere the matter

res nova, we believe that the central premise of Argersinger--that actual imprisonment is a penalty
different in kind from fines or the mere threat of imprisonment--is eminently sound and warrants adoption of actual
imprisonment as the line defining the constitutional right to
appointment of counsel." Scott, supra, at 373.

One year later, in Baldasar v. Illinois, 446 U. S. 222 (1980),
a majority of the Court held that a prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction, constitutional under Scott, could nevertheless not be collaterally used to convert a second misdemeanor conviction into a felony under the applicable Illinois
sentencing enhancement statute. The per curiam opinion
in Baldasar provided no rationale for the result; instead, it
referred to the "reasons stated in the concurring opinions."

subsequent misdemeanor into a felony with a prison term), cert. denied,
451 U. S. 912 (1981); United States v. Castro-Vega, 945 F. 2d 496, 500 (CA2
1991) (Baldasar does not apply where "the court used an uncounseled
misdemeanor conviction to determine the appropriate criminal history category for a crime that was already a felony"), cert. denied sub nom.
Cintron-Rodriguez v. United States, 507 U. S. 908 (1992). But see, e. g.,
United States v. Brady, 928 F. 2d 844, 854 (CA9 1991) (Baldasar and the
Sixth Amendment bar any imprisonment in a subsequent case imposed
because of an uncounseled conviction in which the right to counsel was
not waived).

9 In felony cases, in contrast to misdemeanor charges, the Constitution

requires that an indigent defendant be offered appointed counsel unless
that right is intelligently and competently waived. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963). We have held that convictions gained in
violation of Gideon cannot be used "either to support guilt or enhance
punishment for another offense," Burgett v. Texas, 389 U. S. 109, 115
(1967), and that a subsequent sentence that was based in part on a prior
invalid conviction must be set aside, United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S.
443, 447-449 (1972).

744 NICHOLS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
446 U. S., at 224. There were three different opinions sup-porting the result. Justice Stewart, who was joined by

Justices Brennan and Stevens, stated simply that the defend-ant "was sentenced to an increased term of imprisonment

only because he had been convicted in a previous prosecution
in which he had not had the assistance of appointed counselin his defense," and that "this prison sentence violated the

constitutional rule of Scott . . . ." Ibid. Justice Marshall,who was also joined by

Justices Brennan and Stevens,
rested his opinion on the proposition that an uncounseledmisdemeanor conviction is "not sufficiently reliable" to support imprisonment under Argersinger, and that it "does not
become more reliable merely because the accused has been
validly convicted of a subsequent offense." 446 U. S., at
227-228. Justice Blackmun, who provided the fifth vote,
advanced the same rationale expressed in his dissent in
Scott--that the Constitution requires appointment of counsel
for an indigent defendant whenever he is charged with a
"nonpetty" offense (an offense punishable by more than six
months' imprisonment) or when the defendant is actually
sentenced to imprisonment. 446 U. S., at 229-230. Under
this rationale, Baldasar's prior misdemeanor conviction was
invalid and could not be used for enhancement purposes because the initial misdemeanor was punishable by a prison
term of more than six months.

Justice Powell authored the dissent, in which the remaining three Members of the Court joined. The dissent criticized the majority's holding as one that "undermines the
rationale of Scott and Argersinger and leaves no coherent
rationale in its place." Id., at 231. The dissent opined that
the majority's result misapprehended the nature of enhancement statutes that "do not alter or enlarge a prior sentence,"
ignored the significance of the constitutional validity of the
first conviction under Scott, and created a "hybrid" conviction, good for the punishment actually imposed but not
available for sentence enhancement in a later prosecution.

Opinion of the Court
446 U. S., at 232-233. Finally--and quite presciently--thedissent predicted that the Court's decision would create

confusion in the lower courts. Id., at 234.In Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188 (1977), we stated
that "[w]hen a fragmented Court decides a case and no singlerationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, `the holding of the Court may be viewed as that posi-tion taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds . . . .' " Id., at 193, quoting
Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 169, n. 15 (1976). This testis more easily stated than applied to the various opinions

supporting the result in Baldasar. A number of Courts ofAppeals have decided that there is no lowest common denominator or "narrowest grounds" that represents the Court'sholding. See,

e. g., United States v. Castro-Vega, 945 F. 2d496, 499-500 (CA2 1991); United States v. Eckford, 910 F. 2d

216, 219, n. 8 (CA5 1990); Schindler v. Clerk of Circuit Court,715 F. 2d 341, 345 (CA7 1983), cert. denied, 465 U. S. 1068
(1984). Another Court of Appeals has concluded that theholding in

Baldasar is Justice Blackmun's rationale, San-tillanes v. United States Parole Comm'n, 754 F. 2d 887, 889

(CA10 1985); yet another has concluded that the "consensus"of the Baldasar concurrences is roughly that expressed by
Justice Marshall's concurring opinion. United States v. Wil-liams, 891 F. 2d 212, 214 (CA9 1989). State courts have similarly divided.10 The Sentencing Guidelines have also re-flected uncertainty over Baldasar.

11 We think it not useful

10 See n. 7, supra.
11 The 1989 version of the Sentencing Guidelines stated that, in determining a defendant's criminal history score, an uncounseled misdemeanor
conviction should be excluded only if it "would result in the imposition of
a sentence of imprisonment under circumstances that would violate the
United States Constitution." USSG $ 4A1.2, Application Note 6 (Nov.
1989). Effective November 1, 1990, the Sentencing Commission amended

$ 4A1.2 by deleting the above quoted phrase and adding the following
statement as background commentary: "Prior sentences, not otherwise excluded, are to be counted in the criminal history score, including uncoun511us3$61H 11-04-97 20:25:22 PAGES OPINPGT
746 NICHOLS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
to pursue the Marks inquiry to the utmost logical possibilitywhen it has so obviously baffled and divided the lower courts

that have considered it. This degree of confusion followinga splintered decision such as

Baldasar is itself a reason for
reexamining that decision. Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S.
808, 829-830 (1991); Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, 24-

25 (1973).

Five Members of the Court in Baldasar--the four dissenters and Justice Stewart--expressed continued adherence to
Scott v. Illinois, 440 U. S. 367 (1979). There the defendant
was convicted of shoplifting under a criminal statute which
provided that the penalty for the offense should be a fine of
not more than $500, a term of not more than one year in
jail, or both. The defendant was in fact fined $50, but he
contended that since imprisonment for the offense was authorized by statute, the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments
to the United States Constitution required Illinois to provide
trial counsel. We rejected that contention, holding that so
long as no imprisonment was actually imposed, the Sixth
Amendment right to counsel did not obtain. Id., at 373-374.
We reasoned that the Court, in a number of decisions, had
already expanded the language of the Sixth Amendment well
beyond its obvious meaning, and that the line should be
drawn between criminal proceedings that resulted in imprisonment, and those that did not. Id., at 372.

We adhere to that holding today, but agree with the dissent in Baldasar that a logical consequence of the holding is
that an uncounseled conviction valid under Scott may be reseled misdemeanor sentences where imprisonment was not imposed."
USSG App. C, amdt. 353 (Nov. 1993). When the Sentencing Commission
initially published the amendment for notice and comment, it included the
following explanation: "The Commission does not believe the inclusion of
sentences resulting from constitutionally valid, uncounseled misdemeanor
convictions in the criminal history score is foreclosed by Baldasar v. Illinois, 446 U. S. 222 (1980)." 55 Fed. Reg. 5741 (1990).

Opinion of the Court
lied upon to enhance the sentence for a subsequent offense,
even though that sentence entails imprisonment. Enhancement statutes, whether in the nature of criminal history provisions such as those contained in the Sentencing Guidelines,
or recidivist statutes that are commonplace in state criminal
laws, do not change the penalty imposed for the earlier conviction. As pointed out in the dissenting opinion in Baldasar, "[t]his Court consistently has sustained repeat-offender
laws as penalizing only the last offense committed by the
defendant. E. g., Moore v. Missouri, 159 U. S. 673, 677
(1895); Oyler v. Boles, 368 U. S. 448, 451 (1962)." 446 U. S.,
at 232.

Reliance on such a conviction is also consistent with the
traditional understanding of the sentencing process, which
we have often recognized as less exacting than the process
of establishing guilt. As a general proposition, a sentencing
judge "may appropriately conduct an inquiry broad in scope,
largely unlimited either as to the kind of information he may
consider, or the source from which it may come." United
States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443, 446 (1972). "Traditionally,
sentencing judges have considered a wide variety of factors
in addition to evidence bearing on guilt in determining what
sentence to impose on a convicted defendant." Wisconsin
v. Mitchell, 508 U. S. 476, 485 (1993). One such important
factor, as recognized by state recidivism statutes and the
criminal history component of the Sentencing Guidelines, is
a defendant's prior convictions. Sentencing courts have not
only taken into consideration a defendant's prior convictions,
but have also considered a defendant's past criminal behavior, even if no conviction resulted from that behavior. We
have upheld the constitutionality of considering such previous conduct in Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241 (1949).
We have also upheld the consideration of such conduct, in
connection with the offense presently charged, in McMillan
v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986). There we held that

Opinion of the Court
the state could consider, as a sentence enhancement factor,visible possession of a firearm during the felonies of which

defendant was found guilty.Thus, consistently with due process, petitioner in the present case could have been sentenced more severely based sim-ply on evidence of the underlying conduct that gave rise to
the previous DUI offense. And the state need prove suchconduct only by a preponderance of the evidence.

Id., at91. Surely, then, it must be constitutionally permissible to

consider a prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction basedon the same conduct where that conduct must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.Petitioner contends that, at a minimum, due process requires a misdemeanor defendant to be warned that his con-viction might be used for enhancement purposes should the
defendant later be convicted of another crime. No such re-quirement was suggested in

Scott, and we believe with goodreason. In the first place, a large number of misdemeanor

convictions take place in police or justice courts which arenot courts of record. Without a drastic change in the procedures of these courts, there would be no way to memorializeany such warning. Nor is it at all clear exactly how expansive the warning would have to be; would a Georgia courthave to warn the defendant about permutations and commutations of recidivist statutes in 49 other States, as well asthe criminal history provision of the Sentencing Guidelines
applicable in federal courts? And a warning at the com-pletely general level--that if he is brought back into court
on another criminal charge, a defendant such as Nichols willbe treated more harshly--would merely tell him what he
must surely already know.Today we adhere to Scott v. Illinois, supra, and overrule
Baldasar.12 Accordingly we hold, consistent with the Sixth

I write separately because I do not share the Court's viewthat Baldasar v. Illinois, 446 U. S. 222 (1980), has a holding

that can be "overrule[d]," ante, at 748, and because I wish tobe clear about the narrow ground on which I think this case
is properly decided. Baldasar is an unusual case, not be-cause no single opinion enlisted a majority, but because no
common ground united any five Justices. As I read the vari-ous opinions, eight Members of the

Baldasar Court divided,four to four, over whether an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction that is valid because no prison sentence was imposed,see Scott v. Illinois, 440 U. S. 367 (1979), may be used for
automatic enhancement of the prison sentence attached toa subsequent conviction. See

750 NICHOLS v. UNITED STATES

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
Instead of breaking the tie, the ninth Justice, Justice
Blackmun, declined to accept the premise on which the others proceeded (that the prior uncounseled conviction was
valid under Scott), adhering to his earlier position that an
uncounseled conviction of the sort involved in Baldasar was
not valid for any purpose. See 446 U. S., at 229-230 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (discussing Scott, supra, at 389-390
(Blackmun, J., dissenting)). Significantly for present purposes, Justice Blackmun gave no indication of his view on
whether an uncounseled conviction, if valid under Scott,
could subsequently be used for automatic sentence enhancement. On the question addressed by the other eight Justices, then, the Baldasar Court was in equipoise, leaving a
decision in the same posture as an affirmance by an equally
divided Court, entitled to no precedential value, see United
States v. Pink, 315 U. S. 203, 216 (1942). Cf. Waters v.
Churchill, ante, p. 661; ante, at 685 (Souter, J., concurring);
Book Named "John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of
Pleasure" v. Attorney General of Mass., 383 U. S. 413 (1966)
(discussed in Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188, 193-194
(1977)).

Setting Baldasar aside as controlling precedent (but retaining the case's even split as evidence), it seems safe to say
that the question debated there is a difficult one. The Court
in Scott, relying on Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U. S. 25
(1972), drew a bright line between imprisonment and lesser
criminal penalties, on the theory, as I understand it, that the
concern over reliability raised by the absence of counsel is
tolerable when a defendant does not face the deprivation of
his liberty. See Scott, supra, at 372-373; see also Argersinger, supra, at 34-37 (discussing studies showing that "the
volume of misdemeanor cases . . . may create an obsession for
speedy dispositions, regardless of the fairness of the result")
(footnote omitted). There is an obvious and serious argument that the line drawn in Scott is crossed when, as Justice

Souter, J., concurring in judgment
Stewart put it in Baldasar, a defendant is "sentenced to an
increased term of imprisonment only because he had been
convicted in a previous prosecution in which he had not had
the assistance of appointed counsel in his defense." 446
U. S., at 224 (concurring opinion) (emphasis in original); see
also id., at 227 (Marshall, J., concurring) (petitioner's prison
sentence "was imposed as a direct consequence of [the previous] uncounseled conviction and is therefore forbidden under
Scott and Argersinger").

Fortunately, the difficult constitutional question that argument raises need not be answered in deciding this case, cf.
Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 346-347 (1936) (Brandeis,
J., concurring), for unlike the sentence-enhancement scheme
involved in Baldasar, the United States Sentencing Commission's Guidelines (Guidelines) do not provide for automatic
enhancement based on prior uncounseled convictions. Prior
convictions, as the Court explains, serve under the Guidelines to place the defendant in one of six "criminal history"
categories; the greater the number of prior convictions, the
higher the category. See ante, at 740, and n. 2. But the
Guidelines seek to punish those who exhibit a pattern of
"criminal conduct," not a pattern of prior convictions as such,
see United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (USSG) ch. 4, pt. A (Nov. 1993) (intro. comment.), and
accordingly do not bind a district court to the category into
which simple addition places the defendant. Thus, while the
Guidelines require that "uncounseled misdemeanor sentences
where imprisonment was not imposed" are "to be counted in
the criminal history score," USSG App. C, amdt. 353 (Nov.
1993), they also expressly empower the district court to depart from the range of sentences prescribed for a criminalhistory category that inaccurately captures the defendant's
actual history of criminal conduct. See id., $ 4A1.3. In
particular, the Guidelines authorize downward departure
"where the court concludes that a defendant's criminal his511us3$61M 11-04-97 20:25:22 PAGES OPINPGT

tory category significantly over-represents the seriousnessof a defendant's criminal history or the likelihood that the

defendant will commit further crimes." Ibid.*Under the Guidelines, then, the role prior convictions play
in sentencing is presumptive, not conclusive, and a defendanthas the chance to convince the sentencing court of the unreliability of any prior valid but uncounseled convictions in re-flecting the seriousness of his past criminal conduct or predicting the likelihood of recidivism. A defendant may show,for example, that his prior conviction resulted from railroading an unsophisticated indigent, from a frugal preference fora low fine with no counsel fee, or from a desire to put the
matter behind him instead of investing the time to fight thecharges.

Because the Guidelines allow a defendant to rebut the neg-ative implication to which a prior uncounseled conviction
gives rise, they do not ignore the risk of unreliability associ-ated with such a conviction. Moreover, as the Court observes, permitting a court to consider (in contrast to givingconclusive weight to) a prior uncounseled conviction is "consistent with the traditional understanding of the sentencingprocess," under which a "judge `may appropriately conduct
an inquiry broad in scope, largely unlimited either as to the

kind of information he may consider, or the source fromwhich it may come,' " at least as long as the defendant is

given a reasonable opportunity to disprove the accuracy ofinformation on which the judge may rely, and to contest the
relevancy of that information to sentencing. Ante, at 747
(quoting United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443, 446 (1972)).Where concern for reliability is accommodated, as it is under

the Guidelines, nothing in the Sixth Amendment or our casesrequires a sentencing court to ignore the fact of a valid uncounseled conviction, even if that conviction is a less confi-dent indicator of guilt than a counseled one would be. Cf.
United States Sentencing Commission, Sentencing Guidelines for United States Courts, 55 Fed. Reg. 5741 (1990) (explaining that valid, uncounseled convictions should be counted in determining a defendant's criminal history category
because the alternative would "deprive the [sentencing]
court of significant information relevant to the purposes of
sentencing").

I therefore agree with the Court that it is "constitutionally
permissible" for a federal court to "consider a prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction" in sentencing a defendant
under the Guidelines. Ante, at 748. That is enough to answer the constitutional question this case presents, whether
"[t]he District Court should . . . have considered [petitioner's]
previous uncounseled misdemeanor in computing [his] criminal history score" under the Guidelines. Pet. for Cert. i; see

him in a criminal-history category that "significantly overrepresents the seriousness of [his] criminal history or the

$ 4A1.3, the Court properly rejects petitioner's challenge tohis sentence.

I am shy, however, of endorsing language in the Court'sopinion that may be taken as addressing the constitutional
validity of a sentencing scheme that automatically requiresenhancement for prior uncounseled convictions, a scheme not
now before us. Because I prefer not to risk offending theprinciple that "[t]he Court will not `anticipate a question of
constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it,' "
Ashwander, 297 U. S., at 346 (citation omitted), I concur onlyin the judgment.

Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

In 1983, petitioner Kenneth O. Nichols pleaded nolo con-tendere to driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and

paid a $250 fine. He was not represented by counsel.Under Scott v. Illinois, 440 U. S. 367 (1979), this uncounseled
misdemeanor could not have been used as the basis for anyincarceration, not even a 1-day jail sentence. Seven years
later, when Nichols pleaded guilty to a federal drug charge,this uncounseled misdemeanor, used to enhance his sentence,
led directly to his imprisonment for over two years. Themajority's holding that this enhancement does not violate the
Sixth Amendment is neither compelled by Scott nor faithfulto the concern for reliability that lies at the heart of our
Sixth Amendment cases since Gideon v. Wainwright, 372U. S. 335 (1963). Accordingly, I dissent.

I
The Sixth Amendment provides: "In all criminal prosecu-tions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence." In Gideon v. Wainwright,this Court recognized the "Sixth Amendment's guarantee of
counsel" as " `fundamental and essential to a fair trial,' " id.,at 342, because " `[e]ven the intelligent and educated layman

Blackmun, J., dissenting
. . . requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step inthe proceedings against him,' "

id., at 345, quoting Powell v.
Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 69 (1932).Both the plain wording of the Amendment and the reasoning in Gideon would support the guarantee of counsel in "all"
criminal prosecutions, petty or serious, whatever their con-sequences. See

Scott v. Illinois, 440 U. S., at 376, 379 (Brennan, J., dissenting). Although the Court never has read theguarantee of counsel that broadly, one principle has been

clear, at least until today: No imprisonment may be imposedon the basis of an uncounseled conviction. Thus, in

Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U. S. 25 (1972), the Court rejected aformalistic distinction between petty and non-petty offenses

and applied Gideon to "any criminal trial, where an accused
is deprived of his liberty." Id., at 32; id., at 41, 42 (Burger,C. J., concurring in result) (because "any deprivation of liberty is a serious matter," no individual "can be imprisonedunless he is represented by counsel").

A year later, Scott confirmed that any deprivation of lib-erty, no matter how brief, triggers the Sixth Amendment's
right to counsel:

"Even were the matter res nova, we believe that the
central premise of Argersinger--that actual imprison-ment is a penalty different in kind from fines or the mere

threat of imprisonment--is eminently sound and war-rants adoption of actual imprisonment as the line defining the constitutional right to appointment of counsel. . . . We therefore hold that the Sixth and FourteenthAmendments to the United States Constitution require

only that no indigent criminal defendant be sentenced to
a term of imprisonment unless the State has afforded
him the right to assistance of appointed counsel in his
defense." 440 U. S., at 373-374.

Finally, although the Court, in Baldasar v. Illinois, 446 U. S.
222 (1980), in one sense, was "splintered," ante, at 740, a

511us3$61F 11-04-97 20:25:22 PAGES OPINPGT
756 NICHOLS v. UNITED STATES

Blackmun, J., dissenting
majority of the Court concluded that an uncounseled conviction could not be used to support a prison term, either initially, to punish the misdemeanor, or later, to lengthen the
jail time for a subsequent conviction. See Baldasar, 446
U. S., at 224 (Stewart, J., concurring) (sentencing an indigent
"to an increased term of imprisonment only because he had
been convicted in a previous prosecution in which he had not
had the assistance of appointed counsel in his defense" violated Scott); 446 U. S., at 226 (Marshall, J., concurring) (even
on Scott's terms, a "prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction could not be used collaterally to impose an increased
term of imprisonment upon a subsequent conviction"); 446
U. S., at 230 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (adhering to dissenting position in Scott that an uncounseled conviction is invalid
not only where the defendant is sentenced to any actual incarceration but also where the defendant is convicted of an
offense punishable by more than six months in prison).1

1 I dissented in Scott v. Illinois, 440 U. S. 367 (1979), in which five Members of the Court held that the Sixth Amendment required counsel only
for convictions that were punished by actual imprisonment, and not for
offenses that were punishable by imprisonment, but where imprisonment
was not imposed. Believing that the line the Court drew did not protect
indigent defendants adequately or keep faith with our Sixth Amendment
principles, I argued for a right to counsel not only where the defendant
was convicted and sentenced to jail time, but also where the defendant
was convicted of any offense punishable by more than six months' imprisonment, regardless of the punishment actually imposed. Id., at 389-390.

A year later, when the Court decided Baldasar v. Illinois, 446 U. S. 222
(1980), I adhered to this position, concurring in the Court's per curiam
opinion and its judgment that the uncounseled conviction could not be
used to justify increasing Baldasar's jail time. Although I based my decision on my belief that the uncounseled conviction was invalid in the first
instance because Baldasar was charged with an offense punishable by
more than six months in prison, I expressed no disagreement, and indeed
had none, with the premise that an uncounseled conviction that was valid
under Scott was invalid for purposes of imposing increased incarceration
for a subsequent offense. 446 U. S., at 229-230. Obviously, logic dictates
that, where the threat of imprisonment is enough to trigger the Sixth

757Cite as: 511 U. S. 738 (1994)
Blackmun, J., dissenting
Thus, the animating concern in the Court's Sixth Amend-ment jurisprudence has been to ensure that no indigent is

deprived of his liberty as a result of a proceeding in whichhe lacked the guiding hand of counsel. While the Court has
grappled with, and sometimes divided over, extending thisconstitutional guarantee beyond convictions that lead to actual incarceration, it has never permitted, before now, an un-counseled conviction to serve as the basis for any jail time.

II
Although the Court now expressly overrules Baldasar v.
Illinois, ante, at 748, it purports to adhere to Scott, describ-ing its holding as a "logical consequence" of Scott, ante, at

746. This logic is not unassailable. To the contrary, as Jus-tice Marshall stated in

Baldasar, "a rule that held a convic-tion invalid for imposing a prison term directly, but valid for

imposing a prison term collaterally, would be an illogical andunworkable deviation from our previous cases." 446 U. S.,
at 228-229 (concurring opinion). It is more logical, andmore consistent with the reasoning in Scott, to hold that a
conviction that is invalid for imposing a sentence for theoffense itself remains invalid for increasing the term of imprisonment imposed for a subsequent conviction.The Court skirts

Scott's actual imprisonment standard byasserting that enhancement statutes "do not change the penalty imposed for the earlier conviction," ante, at 747, becausethey punish only the later offense. Although it is undeniable
that recidivist statutes do not impose a second punishmentfor the first offense in violation of the Double Jeopardy
Clause, Moore v. Missouri, 159 U. S. 673, 677 (1895), it alsois undeniable that Nichols' DUI conviction directly resulted
in more than two years' imprisonment. In any event, ourconcern here is not with multiple punishments, but with
reliability. Specifically, is a prior uncounseled misdemeanor
Amendment's guarantee of counsel, the actual imposition of imprisonment
through an enhancement statute also requires the appointment of counsel.

Blackmun, J., dissenting
conviction sufficiently reliable to justify additional jail timeimposed under an enhancement statute? Because imprisonment is a punishment "different in kind" from fines or thethreat of imprisonment, Scott, 440 U. S., at 373, we consistently have read the Sixth Amendment to require that courts
decrease the risk of unreliability, through the provision ofcounsel, where a conviction results in imprisonment. That

the sentence in Scott was imposed in the first instance andthe sentence here was the result of an enhancement statute
is a distinction without a constitutional difference.The Court also defends its position by arguing that the
process of sentencing traditionally is "less exacting" than theprocess of establishing guilt.

Ante, at 747. This may be
true as a general proposition,2 but it does not establish that

2 In support of its position, the majority cites several cases that refer to
a sentencing judge's traditional discretion. The cases provide scant, if
any, support for the majority's rule sanctioning the use of prior uncounseled convictions as the basis for increased terms of imprisonment. None
even addresses the Sixth Amendment guarantee of counsel.

In McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986), the Court held 5 to 4
that a state statute defining visible possession of a firearm as a sentencing
consideration that could be proved by a preponderance of the evidence,
rather than as an element of the crime that must be proved beyond a
reasonable doubt, did not violate due process. McMillan did not involve
the use of a prior conviction in a subsequent proceeding. Additionally,
McMillan involved only felony convictions, in which the defendants were
entitled to counsel at every step of the proceedings to assist in proving or
disproving the facts to be relied on in sentencing. The Court also noted
that the "risk of error" in the challenged proceeding was "comparatively
slight" because visible possession was "a simple, straightforward issue susceptible of objective proof." Id., at 84. The same cannot be said for the
reliability of prior uncounseled misdemeanors. See Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U. S. 25, 34 (1972) (observing that the volume of misdemeanor
cases "may create an obsession for speedy dispositions, regardless of the
fairness of the result"); id., at 35 (noting that " `[t]he misdemeanor trial is
characterized by insufficient and frequently irresponsible preparation,' "
quoting Hellerstein, The Importance of the Misdemeanor Case on Trial
and Appeal, 28 The Legal Aid Brief Case 151, 152 (1970)). Moreover, a
finding of visible possession did not expose a defendant to a greater or

Blackmun, J., dissenting
an uncounseled conviction is reliable enough for SixthAmendment purposes to justify the imposition of imprisonment, even in the sentencing context. Nor does it followthat, because the state may attempt to prove at sentencing
conduct justifying greater punishment, it also may rely on aprior uncounseled conviction. In

McMillan v. Pennsylva-nia, 477 U. S. 79 (1986), for example, the State was permitted

to prove at sentencing that the defendant visibly possesseda firearm during the commission of the felonies of which he
was convicted.3 Where, as in McMillan, the state sets out
additional punishment than otherwise authorized, McMillan, 477 U. S., at
88, while the prior conviction at issue here exposed petitioner to two additional years in prison.

Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U. S. 476 (1993), in which the Court rejected
a First Amendment challenge to a state statute that enhanced a penalty
based on the defendant's motive, is no more helpful to the majority's position. The Court simply observed that the defendant's motive was a factor
traditionally considered by sentencing judges; it said nothing about the
validity of prior convictions or even about the standard required to prove
the motive. Similarly, although United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443,
446 (1972), made passing reference to a sentencing judge's broad inquiry,
it held only that Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963), required resentencing where the sentencing court had considered prior felony convictions that later were found to have been uncounseled.

Finally, Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241 (1949), was a Confrontation
Clause challenge to a sentencing judge's consideration of evidence obtained through a presentence investigation. The court did not rely on
any prior convictions; the defendant, who was represented by counsel, did
not challenge the accuracy of the information the judge considered, ask
the judge to disregard it, or seek to refute or discredit it; and the consideration of this information did not expose the defendant to a greater or
additional punishment.

3 McMillan, of course, was a due process case. Curiously, the Court

appears to rest its holding as much on the Due Process Clause as on the
Sixth Amendment. See ante, at 748. But even if the use of a prior uncounseled conviction does not violate due process, that does not conclusively resolve the Sixth Amendment question. Compare Betts v. Brady,
316 U. S. 455, 462 (1942) (holding that the right to counsel was not required
under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and recognizing due process as a "concept less rigid and more fluid than those envis511us3$61F 11-04-97 20:25:22 PAGES OPINPGT

Blackmun, J., dissenting
to prove actual conduct rather than the fact of conviction ina sentencing proceeding at which the defendant is represented by counsel, counsel can put the state to its proof, ex-amining its witnesses, rebutting its evidence, and testing the
reliability of its allegations. See Argersinger, 407 U. S., at31 (the accused " `requires the guiding hand of counsel

atevery step in the proceedings against him,' " quoting Powell

v. Alabama, 287 U. S., at 69) (emphasis added). In contrast,where the state simply submits a record of a conviction
obtained in a proceeding in which the defendant lacked theassistance of counsel, we lack similar confidence that the
conviction reliably reflects the defendant's conduct.Moreover, as a practical matter, introduction of a record
of conviction generally carries greater weight than other evi-dence of prior conduct. Indeed, the United States Sentencing Commission's Guidelines (Guidelines) require a districtcourt to assess criminal history points for prior convictions,
and to impose a sentence within the range authorized bythe defendant's criminal history, unless it concludes that a
defendant's "criminal history category significantly overaged in other specific and particular provisions of the Bill of Rights"), with
Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S., at 339 (holding that the Sixth Amendment requires counsel in all state felony prosecutions).

Nor do I read the majority's reliance on due process to reflect an understanding that due process requires only partial incorporation of the Sixth
Amendment right to counsel in state courts. This Court long has recognized the "Sixth Amendment's guarantee of counsel" as " `fundamental and
essential to a fair trial' " and therefore "made obligatory upon the States
by the Fourteenth Amendment." Id., at 342; see also Johnson v. Zerbst,
304 U. S. 458, 462 (1938) (the assistance of counsel "is one of the safeguards
of the Sixth Amendment deemed necessary to insure fundamental human
rights of life and liberty"); Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233,
243-244 (1936) ("the fundamental right of the accused to the aid of counsel
in a criminal prosecution" is "safeguarded against state action by the due
process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment"). No decision of
this Court even has intimated that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel
somehow is diluted or truncated in state proceedings.

represents the seriousness of a defendant's criminal historyor the likelihood that a defendant will commit further

crimes." United States Sentencing Commission, GuidelinesManual $ 4A1.3 (Nov. 1993). Realistically, then, the conclusion that a state may prove prior conduct in a sentencingproceeding at which the defendant is aided by counsel does
not support, much less compel, a conclusion that the statemay, in lieu of proving directly the prior conduct, rely on a
conviction obtained against an uncounseled defendant.4

4 Justice Souter concludes that this provision passes Sixth Amendment muster by providing the defendant a "reasonable opportunity" to
disprove the accuracy of the prior conviction. Ante, at 753. Even assuming that the Guidelines would permit a sentencing court to depart downward in response to a defendant's claim that his conviction resulted from
his lack of sophistication or his calculation that it was cheaper to plead
and pay a low fine than to retain counsel and litigate the charge, such a
safety valve still does not accommodate reliability concerns sufficiently.
As Chief Justice Burger recognized in Argersinger, "[a]ppeal from a conviction after an uncounseled trial is not likely to be of much help to a
defendant since the die is usually cast when judgment is entered on an
uncounseled trial record." 407 U. S., at 41 (concurring opinion). A collateral proceeding holds forth no greater promise of relief. The uncounseled
misdemeanor convictions that are considered inherently unreliable under
Argersinger and Scott are presumptively valid under most sentence enhancement schemes, see, e. g., Custis v. United States, ante, p. 485 (limiting a defendant's right to attack as unconstitutional a prior conviction used
to enhance a sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984, 18
U. S. C. $ 924(e)); Parke v. Raley, 506 U. S. 20 (1992) (presumption of validity that attaches to final judgments properly extended to prior convictions
used for sentence enhancement under a state recidivism statute), and are
presumptively reflected in a defendant's criminal history score--and sentence--under the Guidelines, see United States Sentencing Commission,
Guidelines Manual App. C, amdt. 353 (Nov. 1993) ("Prior sentences, not
otherwise excluded, are to be counted in the criminal history score, including uncounseled misdemeanor sentences where imprisonment was not
imposed").

Moreover, although it might be salutary for courts to consider under the
Guidelines a defendant's reasons other than culpability for pleading nolo
contendere to a prior misdemeanor conviction, I do not share Justice

Contrary to the rule set forth by the Court, a rule that anuncounseled misdemeanor conviction

never can form thebasis for a term of imprisonment is faithful to the principle

born of Gideon and announced in Argersinger that an un-counseled misdemeanor, like an uncounseled felony, is not reliable enough to form the basis for the severe sanction ofincarceration. This Court in

Gideon stated that "reason andreflection require us to recognize that in our adversary system of criminal justice, any person haled into court, who istoo poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless
counsel is provided for him." 372 U. S., at 344. Gideon in-volved a felony, but we recognized in Argersinger, 407 U. S.,
at 31, that counsel was "often a requisite to the very exist-ence of a fair trial" in misdemeanor cases, as well. In the
absence of this "assurance" of or "requisite" to a fair trial,we cannot have confidence in the reliability of the conviction
and, therefore, cannot impose a prison term based on it.These reliability concerns have prompted this Court to
hold that an uncounseled felony conviction cannot later beused to increase a prison term under a state recidivist statute, Burgett v. Texas, 389 U. S. 109 (1967), nor even be consid-ered by a court in sentencing for a subsequent conviction,
United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443 (1972). The Courtoffers no reason and I can think of none why the same rules

Souter's confidence that such a benevolent review of a defendant's circumstances is occurring now. Even if it were, a district court, after the

downward too tenuous a check on the use of unreliable misdemeanor convictions to salvage a sentencing scheme that is, in my view, a violation
of Scott.

should not apply with regard to uncounseled misdemeanorconvictions. Counsel can have a profound effect in misdemeanor cases, where both the volume of cases and the pres-sure to plead are great. See Argersinger, 407 U. S., at 36
(" `[m]isdemeanants represented by attorneys are five timesas likely to emerge from police court with all charges dismissed as are defendants who face similar charges withoutcounsel,' " quoting American Civil Liberties Union, Legal
Counsel for Misdemeanants, Preliminary Report 1 (1970));
Baldasar, 446 U. S., at 228, n. 2 (Marshall, J., concurring)(recognizing that misdemeanor convictions may be less reliable than felony convictions because they are obtainedthrough "assembly-line justice" and because jurors may be
less scrupulous in applying the reasonable-doubt standard toa minor offense). Given the utility of counsel in these cases,
the inherent risk of unreliability in the absence of counsel,and the severe sanction of incarceration that can result
directly or indirectly from an uncounseled misdemeanor,there is no reason in law or policy to construe the Sixth
Amendment to exclude the guarantee of counsel where theconviction subsequently results in an increased term of
incarceration.Moreover, the rule that an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction can never be used to increase a prison term is emi-nently logical, as Justice Marshall made clear in Baldasar:

"An uncounseled conviction does not become morereliable merely because the accused has been validly
convicted of a subsequent offense. For this reason, aconviction which is invalid for purposes of imposing a
sentence of imprisonment for the offense itself remainsinvalid for purposes of increasing a term of imprisonment for a subsequent conviction under a repeat-offender statute."

Id., at 227-228 (concurring opinion).5

5 From another perspective, the prior uncounseled conviction can be
viewed as a "hybrid" conviction: valid for the purpose of imposing a
sentence, but invalid for the purpose of depriving the accused of his lib511us3$61F 11-04-97 20:25:22 PAGES OPINPGT

Blackmun, J., dissenting
Finally, this rule is workable. As the Court has engagedin "constitutional line drawing" to determine the "precise

limits and . . . ramifications" of Gideon's principles, Scott, 440U. S., at 372, it has sought to draw a clear line, one that
adequately informs judges, prosecutors, and defendants ofthe consequences of their actions and decisions. Under the
clear rule that an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction cannever justify any term of imprisonment, the judge and the
parties will know, at the beginning of a misdemeanor trial,that no imprisonment may be imposed, directly or collaterally, based on that proceeding, unless counsel is appointed torepresent the indigent accused. See

Argersinger, 407 U. S.,at 42 (Burger, C. J., concurring in result). Admittedly, this

rule might cause the state to seek and judges to grant ap-pointed counsel for more indigent defendants, in order to
preserve the right to use the conviction later for enhancement purposes. The Sixth Amendment guarantee of coun-sel should not be subordinated to these costs. See

id., at
43, 44 (Burger, C. J., concurring in result) (accepting that
the Court's holding would require the appointment of moredefense counsel). In any event, the majority's rule, which

exposes indigent defendants to substantial sentence en-hancements on the basis of minor offenses, may well have
the same result by encouraging more indigent defendantsto seek counsel and to litigate offenses to which they othererty. See Baldasar, 446 U. S., at 232 (Powell, J., dissenting). There is
nothing intuitively offensive about a "hybrid." See id., at 226 (Marshall,
J., concurring) (noting and accepting that Baldasar's conviction was not
valid for all purposes); see also 15 U. S. C. $ 16(a) (certain consent decrees
or consent judgments in favor of the Government in a civil or criminal
antitrust action shall not be prima facie evidence in a subsequent proceeding brought by another party); $ 16(h) (district court proceedings leading

wise might have pleaded. This case is illustrative. Whencharged with driving under the influence, petitioner sought

out an attorney, who told him that he did not need a lawyerif he was pleading nolo contendere. This advice made sense
if a $250 fine was the only consequence of the plea. Itssoundness is less apparent where the consequences can include a 2-year increase in a prison sentence down the road.

IV
With scant discussion of Sixth Amendment case law orprinciples, the Court today approves the imposition of two

years of incarceration as the consequence of an uncounseledmisdemeanor conviction. Because uncounseled misdemeanor convictions lack the reliability this Court has alwaysconsidered a prerequisite for the imposition of any term of
incarceration, I dissent.

Justice Ginsburg, dissenting.
In Custis v. United States, ante, p. 485, the Court heldthat, with the sole exception of convictions obtained in violation of the right to counsel, a defendant in a federal sentenc-ing proceeding has no right to attack collaterally a prior
state conviction used to enhance his sentence under theArmed Career Criminal Act of 1984. This case is dispositively different.

Custis presented a forum question. The issue was where,not whether, the defendant could attack a prior conviction

for constitutional infirmity. See ante, at 497 (Custis "mayattack his state sentence in Maryland or through federal
habeas review").Here, we face an uncounseled prior conviction tolerable
under the Sixth Amendment "assistance of counsel" guaran-tee only because it did not expose defendant Nichols to the
prospect of incarceration. See Scott v. Illinois, 440 U. S. 367(1979). Today's decision enlarges the impact of that uncounseled conviction. It turns what was a disposition allowing

attack his prior uncounseled conviction for what it was.He is seeking only to confine that conviction to the term
(no incarceration) that rendered it constitutional.Recognizing that the issue in this case is not like the one
presented in Custis, I join Justice Blackmun's dissentingopinion.

DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE OF MONTANA v.KURTH RANCH

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 93-144. Argued January 19, 1994--Decided June 6, 1994
Montana law enforcement officers raided the farm of respondents--members of the extended Kurth family--arrested them, and confiscated and
later destroyed their marijuana plants. After the Kurths pleaded
guilty to drug charges, petitioner revenue department attempted, in a
separate proceeding, to collect a state tax imposed on the possession
and storage of dangerous drugs. That tax is collected only after any
state or federal fines or forfeitures have been satisfied, and taxpayers
must file a return after they are arrested. In bankruptcy proceedings
filed by the Kurths, they objected to petitioner's proof of claim for the
tax and challenged the tax's constitutionality. The Bankruptcy Court
held, among other things, that the assessment on harvested marijuana,
a portion of which resulted in a tax eight times the product's market
value, was a form of double jeopardy invalid under the Federal Constitution, and the District Court affirmed. In affirming, the Court of Appeals determined that the central inquiry under United States v. Halper,
490 U. S. 435, is whether the sanction imposed is rationally related to
the damages the government suffered, that the Kurths were entitled to
an accounting to determine if the sanction constituted an impermissible
second punishment, and that the tax was unconstitutional as applied to
them because the State refused to offer any such evidence.

Held: The tax violates the constitutional prohibition against successive

punishments for the same offense. Pp. 776-784.

(a) Although deciding in Halper that a legislature's description of a
statute as civil does not foreclose the possibility that it has a punitive
character, and that a defendant convicted and punished for an offense
may not have a nonremedial civil penalty imposed against him for the
same offense in a separate proceeding, the Court did not consider
whether a tax may similarly be characterized as punitive. However,
the Court's recognition that the extension of a so-called tax's penalizing
feature can cause it to lose its character as such and become a mere
penalty, A. Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292 U. S. 40, 46, together with
Halper's unequivocal statement that labels do not control in a double
jeopardy inquiry, indicates that a tax is not immune from double jeopardy scrutiny simply because it is a tax. Pp. 776-780.

KURTH RANCH

(b) While taxes are usually motivated by revenue-raising rather than
punitive purposes, Montana's tax departs far from normal revenue laws.
Its high rate and deterrent purpose, in and of themselves, do not necessarily render it punitive, but other unusual features set it apart from
most taxes. That it is conditioned on the commission of a crime is significant of penal and prohibitory intent rather than the gathering of
revenue. It is also exacted only after the taxpayer has been arrested
for the precise conduct that gives rise to the tax obligation in the first
place. Since the taxed activity is completely forbidden, the legitimate
revenue-raising purpose that might support the tax could be equally
well served by increasing the fine imposed upon conviction. In addition, it purports to be a property tax, yet it is levied on goods--here,
the destroyed marijuana plants--that the taxpayer neither owns nor
possesses. Pp. 780-783.

(c) Since tax statutes serve a purpose quite different from civil
penalties, it is inappropriate to subject Montana's tax to Halper's test
for a civil penalty: whether the penalty is imposed as a remedy for
actual costs to the State that are attributable to the defendant's conduct.
Moreover, Montana has not claimed that its assessments can be justified
on such grounds, and the same formula would have been used to compute the assessment regardless of the State's damages or whether it
suffered any damages. Montana's tax is not the kind of remedial sanction that may follow the first punishment of a criminal offense. It is a
second punishment that must be imposed during the first prosecution or
not at all. P. 784.

KURTH RANCH

Opinion of the Court

I
Montana's Dangerous Drug Tax Act 2 took effect on Octo-ber 1, 1987. The Act imposes a tax "on the possession and

storage of dangerous drugs," 3 Mont. Code Ann. $ 15-25-111(1987), and expressly provides that the tax is to be "collected
only after any state or federal fines or forfeitures have beensatisfied." $ 15-25-111(3). The tax is either 10 percent of
the assessed market value of the drugs as determined bythe Montana Department of Revenue (DOR) or a specified
amount depending on the drug ($100 per ounce for mari-juana, for example, and $250 per ounce for hashish), whichever is greater. $ 15-25-111(2). The Act directs the statetreasurer to allocate the tax proceeds to special funds to support "youth evaluation" and "chemical abuse" programs and"to enforce the drug laws." $$ 15-25-121, 15-25-122.

4

In addition to imposing reporting responsibilities on lawenforcement agencies,

5 the Act also authorizes the DOR to

2 Mont. Code Ann. $$ 15-25-101 through 15-25-123 (1987). See In re
Kurth Ranch, 145 B. R. 61, 66 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Mont. 1990). We refer
throughout this opinion to the 1987 edition of the Montana Code--the version in effect at the time of the Kurths' arrest. Some sections of the
Dangerous Drug Tax Act have since been amended.

3 The Act defines "dangerous drug" as that term is defined in the Montana Code provisions that criminalize the possession of such drugs, see
Mont. Code Ann. $$ 15-25-103(2), 50-32-101(6), 45-9-102 (1987), and authorize their seizure, see $ 44-12-103.

4 According to the Act's preamble, the Montana Legislature recognizes

that the use of dangerous drugs is not acceptable, but concludes that because the manufacturing and sale of such drugs has an economic impact
on the State, "it is appropriate that some of the revenue generated by
this tax be devoted to continuing investigative efforts directed toward the
identification, arrest, and prosecution of individuals involved in conducting
illegal continuing criminal enterprises that affect the distribution of dangerous drugs in Montana." 1987 Mont. Laws, ch. 563, p. 1416.

5 Section 5(1) of the Act provides that "[a]ll law enforcement personnel

and peace officers shall promptly report each person subject to the tax to
the department, together with such other information which the depart511us3$62I 11-08-97 20:07:35 PAGES OPINPGT

adopt rules to administer and enforce the tax. Under thoserules, taxpayers must file a return within 72 hours of their

arrest. Mont. Admin. Rule 42.34.102(1) (1988). The Rulealso provides that "[a]t the time of arrest law enforcement
personnel shall complete the dangerous drug information re-port as required by the department and afford the taxpayer
an opportunity to sign it." Rule 42.34.102(3). If the tax-payer refuses to do so, the law enforcement officer is required to file the form within 72 hours of the arrest. Ibid.The "associated criminal nature of assessments under this
act" justifies the expedited collection procedures. See Rule42.34.103(3). The taxpayer has no obligation to file a return
or to pay any tax unless and until he is arrested.

The six respondents, all members of the extended Kurthfamily, have for years operated a mixed grain and livestock

farm in central Montana.6 In 1986 they began to cultivateand sell marijuana. About two weeks after the new Dangerous Drug Tax Act went into effect, Montana law en-forcement officers raided the farm, arrested the Kurths,
and confiscated all the marijuana plants, materials, and para-phernalia they found.

marijuana business and gave rise to four separate legalproceedings.

In one of those proceedings, the State filed criminalcharges against all six respondents in the Montana District
Court, charging each with conspiracy to possess drugs withthe intent to sell, Mont. Code Ann. $ 45-4-102 (1987), or, in
the alternative, possession of drugs with the intent to sell,$ 45-9-103.

8 Each respondent initially pleaded not guilty,

but subsequently entered into a plea agreement. On July
18, 1988, the court sentenced Richard Kurth and JudithKurth to prison and imposed suspended or deferred sentences on the other four family members.9The county attorney also filed a civil forfeiture action seeking recovery of cash and equipment used in the marijuanaoperation. The confiscated drugs were not involved in that
action, presumably because law enforcement agents had de-stroyed them after an inventory. Respondents settled the
forfeiture action with an agreement to forfeit $18,016.83 in
cash and various items of equipment.

"Item #7: 1 bag of marijuana, 1/4 pound,
"Item #8: 5 plastic bags of marijuana, total 2230 grams,
"Item #9: approximately 100 pounds of marijuana stems, leaves, parts,
etc." 145 B. R., at 66-67.

8 Plaintiff's Exhs. 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13; 145 B. R., at 64-65. Richard Kurth

was also charged with criminal sale of dangerous drugs (marijuana), Mont.
Code Ann. $ 45-9-101 (1987), criminal possession of a dangerous drug
(marijuana) with intent to sell, $ 45-9-103, solicitation to commit the offense of criminal possession of a dangerous drug (marijuana) with intent
to sell, $ 45-4-101, and criminal possession of a dangerous drug (hashish),

$ 45-9-102. See Plaintiff's Exh. 3.

9 Because only one respondent, Richard Kurth, was adjudged guilty of

the offense of possession (the other five pleaded guilty to the conspiracy
count), Montana has suggested that only he has standing to argue that the
tax on possession constitutes a second punishment for the same offense.
Respondents counter that Montana's withdrawal of the possession charges
pursuant to the plea agreements would bar a second prosecution for possession. The issue was not raised below, so we do not address it.

Opinion of the Court
The third proceeding involved the assessment of the new
tax on dangerous drugs. Despite difficulties the DOR had
in applying the Act for the first time, it ultimately attempted
to collect almost $900,000 in taxes on marijuana plants,
harvested marijuana, hash tar and hash oil, interest, and penalties.10 The Kurths contested the assessments in administrative proceedings. Those proceedings were automatically
stayed in September 1988, however, when the Kurths initiated the fourth legal proceeding triggered by the raid on
their farm: a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code. See 11 U. S. C. $ 362(a).

In the bankruptcy proceedings, the Kurths objected to the
DOR's proof of claim for unpaid drug taxes and challenged
the constitutionality of the Montana tax. After a trial, the
Bankruptcy Court held most of the assessment invalid as a
matter of state law,11 but concluded that an assessment of
$181,000 on 1,811 ounces of harvested marijuana was authorized by the Act. It held that assessment invalid under the
Federal Constitution.

Relying primarily on United States v. Halper, 490 U. S.
435 (1989), the Bankruptcy Court decided that the assessment constituted a form of double jeopardy. The court rejected the State's argument that the tax was not a penalty
because it was designed to recover law enforcement costs; as
the court noted, the DOR "failed to introduce one scintilla of
evidence as to cost of the above government programs or
costs of law enforcement incurred to combat illegal drug

10 The precise figure appears to be $894,940.99. 145 B. R., at 68. The
Court of Appeals' figure of "nearly $865,000," In re Kurth Ranch, 986
F. 2d 1308, 1310 (CA9 1993), apparently failed to take account of the
$30,000 collected before computation of the final assessment. 145 B. R.,
at 68.

11 Specifically, the Bankruptcy Court held that the assessments on the

live marijuana plants and the marijuana oil were "arbitrary" and "lacked
any basis in fact." Id., at 69.

activity." 145 B. R., at 74. After noting that a portion ofthe assessment resulted in a tax eight times the product's

market value,12 the court explained that the punitive char-acter of the tax was evident

"because drug tax laws have historically been regardedas penal in nature, the Montana Act promotes the traditional aims of punishment--retribution and deterrence,the tax applies to behavior which is already a crime, the
tax allows for sanctions by restraint of Debtors' prop-erty, the tax requires a finding of illegal possession of
dangerous drugs and therefore a finding of scienter, thetax will promote elimination of illegal drug possession,
and the tax appears excessive in relation to the alter-nate purpose assigned, especially in the absence of any
record developed by the State as to societal costs. Fi-nally, the tax follows arrest for possession of illegal
drugs and the tax report is made by law enforcementofficers, not the taxpayer, who may or may not sign the
report." Id., at 75-76.
These aspects led the court to the "inescapable conclusion"that the drug tax statute's purpose was deterrence and punishment. Id., at 76.The District Court affirmed. Agreeing with the Bankruptcy Court's findings and reasoning, it concluded that theMontana Dangerous Drug Tax Act "simply punishes the
Kurths a second time for the same criminal conduct." Inre Kurth Ranch, CV-90-084-GF, 1991 WL 365065 (D. Mont.,
Apr. 23, 1991) (reprinted at App. to Pet. for Cert. 22). That

refers to the stems, leaves, and other loose parts of the marijuana plant
that have less value because of their lower levels of tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC), the chemical substance in marijuana that activates a user's senses.
Id., at 66. Officials placed the market value for shake at $200 per pound.
Thus, when Montana taxed the shake at $100 per ounce, or $1,600 per
pound, it taxed it at eight times its market value. Id., at 72.

Opinion of the Court
and the DOR's failure to provide an accounting of its actualdamages or costs convinced the Bankruptcy Court that the

tax assessments violated the Fifth Amendment's DoubleJeopardy Clause. Ibid.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit also affirmed,but based its conclusion largely on the State's refusal to offer
evidence justifying the tax, and accordingly refused to holdthe tax unconstitutional on its face.

In re Kurth Ranch, 986F. 2d 1308, 1312 (1993). The court first determined that

under Halper, a disproportionately large civil penalty can bepunitive for double jeopardy purposes. 986 F. 2d, at 1310.
That the assessment is called a tax, as opposed to some kindof penalty, is not controlling.

Id., at 1310-1311. The cen-tral inquiry under Halper, the court determined, is whether

the sanction imposed is rationally related to the damages thegovernment suffered. 986 F. 2d, at 1311. That inquiry only
applies to cases in which there has been a separate criminalconviction, however.

13 The court concluded that the Kurths

were entitled to an accounting to determine if the sanctionconstitutes an impermissible second punishment, and because the State refused to offer any such evidence, it held thetax unconstitutional as applied to the Kurths. Id., at 1312.

While this case was pending on appeal, the Montana Su-preme Court reversed two lower state-court decisions that
had held that the Dangerous Drug Tax Act was a form ofdouble jeopardy.

Sorensen v. State Dept. of Revenue, 254Mont. 61, 836 P. 2d 29 (1992). Over the dissent of two jus13 It is on this basis that the court distinguished this Court's cases holding a federal marijuana tax to be nonpunitive, see Minor v. United States,

did not involve previous criminal convictions. 986 F. 2d, at 1311. The
court acknowledged that a State may legitimately tax criminal activities,
ibid., (citing Marchetti v. United States, 390 U. S. 39, 44 (1968)), and that
a civil sanction need not satisfy a remedial analysis when it is imposed
apart from a criminal conviction. 986 F. 2d, at 1311 (citing Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 623 (1981)).

tices, the State Supreme Court found that the legislature hadintended to establish a civil, not a criminal, penalty and that

the tax had a remedial purpose other than promoting retri-bution and deterrence. Id., at 65, 836 P. 2d, at 31. The
court found that Halper was not controlling, both because itexpressly announced " `a rule for the rare case' " and because
the case involved a civil penalty, not a tax. 254 Mont., at 67,836 P. 2d, at 32-33. The

Sorensen court concluded that thedrug tax was not excessive and that a tax, unlike the civil

sanction at issue in Halper, requires no proof of the State'sremedial costs on the part of the State. 254 Mont., at 67-68,
836 P. 2d, at 33.The Montana Supreme Court's decision is directly at odds
with the conclusion reached in the federal proceedings in-volving the Kurths. We therefore granted certiorari to review the decision of the Court of Appeals. 509 U. S. 953(1993). We now affirm its judgment.

III
In Halper we considered "whether and under what circum-stances a civil penalty may constitute `punishment' for the

purposes of double jeopardy analysis." 490 U. S., at 436.Our answer to that question does not decide the different
question whether Montana's tax should be characterized aspunishment.

Halper was convicted of 65 separate violations of the crim-inal false claims statute, 18 U. S. C. $ 287, each involving a
demand for $12 in reimbursement for medical services worthonly $3. After Halper was sentenced to two years in prison
and fined $5,000, the Government filed a separate action torecover a $2,000 civil penalty for each of the 65 violations.
See 31 U. S. C. $ 3729 (1982 ed., Supp. II). The DistrictCourt found that the $130,000 recovery the statute authorized "bore no `rational relation' to the sum of the Govern-ment's $585 actual loss plus its costs in investigating and
prosecuting Halper's false claims." 490 U. S., at 439. In

Opinion of the Court
the court's view, a civil penalty "more than 220 times greater
than the Government's measurable los[s] qualified as punishment" that was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.
Ibid.

On direct appeal to this Court, we rejected the Government's submission that the Double Jeopardy Clause only applied to punishment imposed in criminal proceedings, reasoning that its violation "can be identified only by assessing the
character of the actual sanctions imposed on the individual
by the machinery of the state." Id., at 447.14 In making
such an assessment, "the labels `criminal' and `civil' are not
of paramount importance." Ibid. Accepting the District
Court's findings, we held that "a defendant who already has
been punished in a criminal prosecution may not be subjected to an additional civil sanction to the extent that the
second sanction may not fairly be characterized as remedial,
but only as a deterrent or retribution." Id., at 448-449.

Halper thus decided that the legislature's description of a
statute as civil does not foreclose the possibility that it has
a punitive character.15 We also recognized in Halper that a
so-called civil "penalty" may be remedial in character if it
merely reimburses the government for its actual costs arising from the defendant's criminal conduct. Id., at 449-450,

14 We noted, however, that whether a sanction constitutes punishment is
not determined from the defendant's perspective, as even remedial sanctions carry the "sting of punishment." 490 U. S., at 447, n. 7 (citing United
States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537, 551 (1943)).

15 Notably, in reaching that conclusion we relied in part on an earlier

case recognizing that a tax statute might be considered punitive in character for double jeopardy purposes. See 490 U. S., at 443. That case,
United States v. La Franca, 282 U. S. 568 (1931), observed that the words
"tax" and "penalty" "are not interchangeable, one for the other" and that
"if an exaction be clearly a penalty it cannot be converted into a tax by
the simple expedient of calling it such." Id., at 572. See also Lipke v.
Lederer, 259 U. S. 557, 561 (1922) ("The mere use of the word `tax' in an
act primarily designed to define and suppress crime is not enough to show
that within the true intendment of the term a tax was laid").

452. We therefore remanded the case to the District Court
to determine what portion of the statutory penalty could be
sustained as compensation for the Government's actual
damages.

Halper did not, however, consider whether a tax may
similarly be characterized as punitive.

IV
Criminal fines, civil penalties, civil forfeitures, and taxes
all share certain features: They generate government revenues, impose fiscal burdens on individuals, and deter certain
behavior. All of these sanctions are subject to constitutional constraints. A government may not impose criminal
fines without first establishing guilt by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Cf. In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970). A
defendant convicted and punished for an offense may not
have a nonremedial civil penalty imposed against him for
the same offense in a separate proceeding. United States v.
Halper, 490 U. S. 435 (1989). A civil forfeiture may violate
the Eighth Amendment's proscription against excessive
fines. Austin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602 (1993). And a
statute imposing a tax on unlawful conduct may be invalid
because its reporting requirements compel taxpayers to
incriminate themselves. Marchetti v. United States, 390
U. S. 39 (1968).

As a general matter, the unlawfulness of an activity
does not prevent its taxation. Id., at 44; United States
v. Constantine, 296 U. S. 287, 293 (1935); James v. United
States, 366 U. S. 213 (1961). Montana no doubt could collect
its tax on the possession of marijuana, for example, if it had
not previously punished the taxpayer for the same offense,
or, indeed, if it had assessed the tax in the same proceeding
that resulted in his conviction. Missouri v. Hunter, 459
U. S. 359, 368-369 (1983); see also Halper, 490 U. S., at 450.

tics that subject it to the constraints of the Double Jeop-ardy Clause.

Although we have never held that a tax violated the Dou-ble Jeopardy Clause, we have assumed that one might.

16 In

the context of other constitutional requirements, we haverepeatedly examined taxes for constitutional validity. We

have cautioned against invalidating a tax simply because itsenforcement might be oppressive or because the legislature's
motive was somehow suspect. A. Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292 U. S. 40, 44 (1934). Yet we have also recognizedthat "there comes a time in the extension of the penalizing

features of the so-called tax when it loses its character assuch and becomes a mere penalty with the characteristics of
regulation and punishment." Id., at 46 (citing Child Labor
Tax Case, 259 U. S. 20, 38 (1922)). That comment, togetherwith

Halper's unequivocal statement that labels do not control in a double jeopardy inquiry, indicates that a tax is notimmune from double jeopardy scrutiny simply because it is

a tax.

Halper recognized that "[t]his constitutional protection is
intrinsically personal," and that only "the character of the
actual sanctions" can substantiate a possible double jeopardyviolation. 490 U. S., at 447. Whereas fines, penalties, and

forfeitures are readily characterized as sanctions, taxes aretypically different because they are usually motivated by

16 In Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391 (1938), for example, this Court
considered a Revenue Act provision requiring the taxpayer to pay an additional 50 percent of the total amount of any deficiency due to fraud with
an intent to evade the tax. The Court assumed such a penalty could trigger double jeopardy protection if it were intended for punishment, but it
nevertheless held that the statute was constitutional because the 50 percent addition to the tax was remedial, not punitive. Id., at 398-405. Although the penalty at issue in Mitchell is arguably better characterized
as a sanction for fraud than a tax, the Court described it interchangeably
as a "sanction," id., at 405, 406, an "addition to the tax," id., at 405, an
"assessment," id., at 396, and a "tax," id., at 398, making nothing of the
potential import of the distinction.

revenue-raising, rather than punitive, purposes. Yet atsome point, an exaction labeled as a tax approaches punishment, and our task is to determine whether Montana's drugtax crosses that line.

We begin by noting that neither a high rate of taxationnor an obvious deterrent purpose automatically marks this
tax as a form of punishment. In this case, although thosefactors are not dispositive, they are at least consistent with
a punitive character. A significant part of the assessmentwas more than eight times the drug's market value--a remarkably high tax.17 That the Montana Legislature in-tended the tax to deter people from possessing marijuana is
beyond question.18 The DOR reminds us, however, thatmany taxes that are presumed valid, such as taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, are also both high and motivated to some

17 The State recovered 1,811 ounces of marijuana with an estimated
value of $46,000, and taxed the marijuana at $100 per ounce (that is, the
greater of 10 percent of market value or $100 per ounce), for a total tax
of $181,000. The State thus taxed the drugs at about 400 percent of their
market value. Compared to similar taxes on legal goods and activities,
Montana's tax--assessed at a rate of 10 percent or roughly 400 percent of
market value, whichever is greater--appears to be unrivaled. Even the
taxes identified by the United States, which supports the DOR as amicus
curiae, do not approach a level this high. See Brief for United States
as Amicus Curiae 23-24. The United States notes hypothetically, for
example, that the current 24-cent-per-pack federal tax on cigarettes could,
under a new health plan, be increased to 99 cents, resulting in a total
tax burden that "could easily surpass" the 80 percent rate that Montana
imposed on the part of the marijuana consisting of the higher valued
" `buds.' " Ibid. The Government offers no such example, however, of a
tax equivalent to that assessed on the combined cache of buds and lower
valued "shake." See n. 12, supra.

18 For example, although the Act's preamble evinces a clear motivation

to raise revenue, it also indicates that the tax will provide for anticrime
initiatives by "burdening" violators of the law instead of "law abiding
taxpayers"; that use of dangerous drugs is not acceptable; and that the
Act is not intended to "give credence" to any notion that manufacturing,
selling, or using drugs is legal or proper. 1987 Mont. Laws, ch. 563,
p. 1416.

extent by an interest in deterrence. Indeed, although nodouble jeopardy challenge was at issue, this Court sustained

the steep $100-per-ounce federal tax on marijuana in UnitedStates v. Sanchez, 340 U. S. 42 (1950). Thus, while a high
tax rate and deterrent purpose lend support to the charac-terization of the drug tax as punishment, these features, in
and of themselves, do not necessarily render the tax puni-tive. Cf.

Sonzinsky v. United States, 300 U. S. 506, 513-514 (1937).

Other unusual features, however, set the Montana statuteapart from most taxes. First, this so-called tax is conditioned on the commission of a crime. That condition is"significant of penal and prohibitory intent rather than the
gathering of revenue." 19 Moreover, the Court has reliedon the absence of such a condition to support its conclusion
that a particular federal tax was a civil, rather than a crimi-nal, sanction.

20 In this case, the tax assessment not only

hinges on the commission of a crime, it also is exacted onlyafter the taxpayer has been arrested for the precise conduct

that gives rise to the tax obligation in the first place.21 Per19 United States v. Constantine, 296 U. S. 287, 295 (1935) (concluding
that a tax was motivated by penal instead of revenue-raising intent in part
because the taxpayer had to pay an additional sum based on his illegal
conduct). See also United States v. La Franca, 282 U. S., at 571, 575
(holding that a liquor tax assessed only against those prosecuted for illegal
manufacture or sale of liquor was barred on statutory grounds, thus avoiding the "grave constitutional question" whether double jeopardy principles
precluded such an assessment).

20 In Sanchez we examined a federal marijuana tax, IRC $ 2590-(a)(2)

(since repealed, but last codified at 26 U. S. C. $ 4741 et seq. (1964)), that
taxed the transfer of marijuana to a person who has not paid a special tax
and registered. Under the statute, the transferor's liability arose when
the transferee failed to pay the tax; as a result, "[s]ince his tax liability
does not in effect rest on criminal conduct, the tax can be properly called
a civil rather than a criminal sanction." 340 U. S., at 45.

21 This statute therefore does not raise the question whether an ostensibly civil proceeding that is designed to inflict punishment may bar a subsequent proceeding that is admittedly criminal in character. See Justice

sons who have been arrested for possessing marijuana con-stitute the entire class of taxpayers subject to the Montana

tax.Taxes imposed upon illegal activities are fundamentally
different from taxes with a pure revenue-raising purposethat are imposed

despite their adverse effect on the taxedactivity. But they differ as well from mixed-motive taxes

that governments impose both to deter a disfavored activityand to raise money. By imposing cigarette taxes, for example, a government wants to discourage smoking. But be-cause the product's benefits--such as creating employment,
satisfying consumer demand, and providing tax revenues--are regarded as outweighing the harm, that government will
allow the manufacture, sale, and use of cigarettes as long asthe manufacturers, sellers, and smokers pay high taxes that
reduce consumption and increase government revenue.These justifications vanish when the taxed activity is completely forbidden, for the legitimate revenue-raising purposethat might support such a tax could be equally well served
by increasing the fine imposed upon conviction.22
Scalia's dissent, post, at 804. Nor does the statute require us to comment on the permissibility of "multiple punishments" imposed in the same
proceeding, cf. Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163 (1874); North Carolina v.
Pearce, 395 U. S. 711 (1969), since it involves separate sanctions imposed
in successive proceedings.

22 In this case, it is significant that the same sovereign that criminalized

the activity also imposed the tax. Contrarily, most of our cases confirming that the unlawfulness of an activity does not prevent its taxation involve taxes on acts prohibited by other sovereigns. For example, United
States v. Constantine, 296 U. S. 287 (1935), involved a federal excise tax
on retail liquor sales that violated state law. Id., at 293. Likewise, in
James v. United States, 366 U. S. 213 (1961), a federal tax on embezzled
money was imposed upon a man who had pleaded guilty in state court to
conspiracy to embezzle. Id., at 214. And Marchetti v. United States, 390
U. S. 39 (1968), involved a federal tax on gambling activities primarily
prohibited under state law, though as the Court there noted, some federal
statutes also prohibited activities ancillary to wagering. Id., at 44-47.

Opinion of the Court
The Montana tax is exceptional for an additional reason.
Although it purports to be a species of property tax--that
is, a "tax on the possession and storage of dangerous drugs,"
Mont. Code Ann. $ 15-25-111 (1987)--it is levied on goods
that the taxpayer neither owns nor possesses when the tax
is imposed. Indeed, the State presumably destroyed the
contraband goods in this case before the tax on them was
assessed. If a statute that amounts to a confiscation of property is unconstitutional, Heiner v. Donnan, 285 U. S. 312, 326
(1932); Nichols v. Coolidge, 274 U. S. 531, 542 (1927), a tax
on previously confiscated goods is at least questionable.23 A
tax on "possession" of goods that no longer exist and that
the taxpayer never lawfully possessed has an unmistakable
punitive character. This tax, imposed on criminals and no
others, departs so far from normal revenue laws as to become a form of punishment.

Taken as a whole, this drug tax is a concoction of anomalies, too far removed in crucial respects from a standard tax
assessment to escape characterization as punishment for the
purpose of double jeopardy analysis.24

and dual sovereign proceedings also is borne out by our cases holding that
the Constitution does not prohibit successive prosecutions by different
sovereigns based on the same conduct. See, e. g., Bartkus v. Illinois, 359
U. S. 121 (1959) (state prosecution after federal); Abbate v. United States,
359 U. S. 187 (1959) (federal prosecution after state).

23 Curiously, one of two alternative measures of the tax is the market

value of a substance that cannot legally be marketed.

24 Courts--including this Court in United States v. Sanchez, 340 U. S. 42

(1950)--have frequently commented on the punishing and deterrent nature
of drug taxes. See, e. g., Sims v. State Tax Comm'n, 841 P. 2d 6, 13 (Utah
1992); Rehg v. Illinois Dept. of Revenue, 152 Ill. 2d 504, 515, 605 N. E. 2d

KURTH RANCH

Opinion of the Court

V
Because Montana's tax is fairly characterized as punishment, the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be affirmed. In Halper, we recognized that a civil penalty may
be imposed as a remedy for actual costs to the State that are
attributable to the defendant's conduct. 490 U. S., at 452.
Yet as The Chief Justice points out, tax statutes serve
a purpose quite different from civil penalties, and Halper's
method of determining whether the exaction was remedial
or punitive "simply does not work in the case of a tax statute." Post, at 787 (dissenting opinion). Subjecting Montana's drug tax to Halper's test for civil penalties is therefore
inappropriate. Even if it were proper to permit such a
showing, Montana has not claimed that its assessment in this
case even remotely approximates the cost of investigating,
apprehending, and prosecuting the Kurths, or that it roughly
relates to any actual damages that they caused the State.
And in any event, the formula by which Montana computed
the tax assessment would have been the same regardless of
the amount of the State's damages and, indeed, regardless of
whether it suffered any harm at all.

This drug tax is not the kind of remedial sanction that may
follow the first punishment of a criminal offense. Instead, it
is a second punishment within the contemplation of a constitutional protection that has "deep roots in our history and
jurisprudence," Halper, 490 U. S., at 440, and therefore must
be imposed during the first prosecution or not at all. The
proceeding Montana initiated to collect a tax on the possession of drugs was the functional equivalent of a successive
criminal prosecution that placed the Kurths in jeopardy a
second time "for the same offence."

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, dissenting.
Without giving any indication that it is doing so, theCourt's opinion drastically alters existing law. We have

never previously subjected a tax statute to double jeopardyanalysis, but under today's decision a state tax statute is
struck down because its application violates double jeopardy.The Court starts off on the right foot. It correctly recognizes that our opinion in United States v. Halper, 490 U. S.435 (1989), says nothing about the possible double jeopardy
concerns of a tax, as opposed to a civil fine like the one con-fronted in Halper. Ante, at 777. I agree with the Court's
rejection of the Halper mode of analysis, which, with its ef-fort to determine whether a penalty statute is remedial or
punitive, simply does not fit in the case of a tax statute.
Ante, at 783. But the Court then goes astray and the endresult of its decision is a hodgepodge of criteria--many of

which have been squarely rejected by our previous deci-sions--to be used in deciding whether a tax statute qualifies
as "punishment."The Court cites the case of

Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S.391 (1938), as one in which a tax statute was subjected to

double jeopardy analysis. But I agree with the Court'sstatement that the "penalty at issue in Mitchell is arguably
better characterized as a sanction for fraud than a tax."Ante, at 779, n. 16.

1 All of our other cases in this area of

n. 16. The only language which was used by the Mitchell Court to which
we are referred for this proposition is 303 U. S., at 398, where the Court
uses the word "tax" three times, but only in the context of summarizing
the parties' arguments. As for the first two times, the word "tax" is
mentioned only in discussing the Government's argument that the indictment of Mitchell for willful evasion of the tax in question did not raise the
same issue as did the civil proceeding for the fraud penalty for purposes
of res judicata. The Court simply said:

"Since there was not even an adjudication that Mitchell did not wilfully
attempt to evade or defeat the tax, it is not necessary to decide whether

the law involved claims of double jeopardy where a statuteimposing what was denominated a "civil penalty" was invoked following a separate criminal proceeding based on anindictment for fraud. In

Mitchell, supra, United States ex
rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537 (1943), and Rex Trailer Co.
v. United States, 350 U. S. 148 (1956), the double jeopardyclaim was rejected; in

United States v. Halper, supra, a double jeopardy claim was upheld for the first time.The Court, unlike the Court of Appeals below, wisely does

not subject the Montana tax to the Halper analysis and it isthus unnecessary to determine whether

Halper was correctly decided. See post, at 802-805 (Scalia, J., dissenting).This clearly is not the "rare case" contemplated by

Halper,
nor does this tax involve a "fixed-penalty provision."
Halper, supra, at 449. In Halper, we held that the doublejeopardy test was whether or not the penalty statute there

enabled the Government to recover more than an approximation of its costs in bringing the fraudulent actor to book,
because compensation for the Government's loss is the
avowed purpose of a civil penalty statute. But here we are
confronted with a tax statute, and the purpose of a tax statute is not to recover the costs incurred by the Government
for bringing someone to book for some violation of law, but
is instead either to raise revenue or to deter conduct, or both.
See, e. g., Welch v. Henry, 305 U. S. 134, 146 (1938); Sonzinsky v. United States, 300 U. S. 506, 513 (1937). Thus, despite
Justice O'Connor's attempt to view this case through the
Halper lens, post, at 793, the reasoning quite properly employed in Halper to decide whether the exaction was remesuch an adjudication would be decisive also of this issue of fraud." Ibid.
The word "tax" is mentioned a third time in setting out the respondent's
argument that "this proceeding is barred under the doctrine of double
jeopardy because the 50 per centum addition . . . is not a tax, but a criminal
penalty intended as punishment for allegedly fraudulent acts." Ibid. It
is telling to note that the Court immediately thereafter denotes the 50%
addition as a "sanction," and not a tax. Id., at 398-399.

dial or punitive simply does not work in the case of a taxstatute. Tax statutes need not be based on any benefit accorded to the taxpayer or on any damage or cost incurredby the Government as a result of the taxpayer's activities.
Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 622
(1981). Thus, in analyzing the instant tax statute, the in-quiry into the State's "damages caused by the [Kurths']

wrongful conduct," post, at 794 (O'Connor, J., dissenting), isunduly restrictive.

The proper question to be asked is whether the Montanadrug tax constitutes a second punishment under the Double
Jeopardy Clause for conduct already punished criminally.
The Court asks the right question, ante, at 780, but reaches
the wrong conclusion.

Taxes are customarily enacted to raise revenue to support
the costs of government. Cf. ante, at 779-780 ("[T]axes are
typically different [than fines, penalties, and forfeitures]
because they are usually motivated by revenue-raising . . . purposes"). It is also firmly established that taxes may be enacted to deter or even suppress the taxed activity. Constitutional attacks on such laws have been regularly turned aside
in our previous decisions. In A. Magnano Co. v. Hamilton,
292 U. S. 40 (1934), for example, the Court upheld against a
due process challenge a steep excise tax imposed by the
State of Washington on processors of oleomargarine during
the depths of the depression. In Sonzinsky v. United
States, supra, at 513, the Court upheld an annual federal
firearms tax as a valid exercise of the taxing power of Congress. The Court there said "it has long been established
that an Act of Congress which on its face purports to be an
exercise of the taxing power is not any the less so because
the tax is burdensome or tends to restrict or suppress the
thing taxed." In United States v. Sanchez, 340 U. S. 42
(1950), the Court upheld the former federal tax on marijuana
at the rate of $100 per ounce against a challenge that the tax
was a penalty, rather than a true tax. In so doing, the Court

noted that "[i]t is beyond serious question that a tax does not
cease to be valid merely because it regulates, discourages, or
even definitely deters the activity taxed." Id., at 44. And,
as the Court concedes, ante, at 778-779, it is well settled that
the unlawfulness of an activity does not prevent its taxation.

States v. Constantine, 296 U. S. 287, 293 (1935).

The Court's opinion today gives a passing nod to these
cases, but proceeds to hold that a high tax rate and a deterrent purpose "lend support to the characterization of the
drug tax as punishment." Ante, at 781. The Court then
discusses "[o]ther unusual features" of the Montana tax
which, it concludes, brands this tax as a criminal penalty.

The Court first points to its conclusion that the so-called
tax is conditioned on the commission of a crime, ibid., a
conclusion that the State disputes, and for good reason.

42.34.102(1) (1988), which provides that the tax return "shall
be filed within 72 hours of . . . arrest," merely acknowledges
the practical realities involved in taxing an illegal activity.2
Then, quite contrary to the teachings of Marchetti, Constantine, and James v. United States, 366 U. S. 213 (1961),
the Court states that the justifications for mixed-motive
taxes--imposed both to deter and to raise revenue--vanish
"when the taxed activity is completely forbidden." Ante,
at 782.

2 Other potential schemes for taxing illegal drug possession will face
similar pitfalls. Because the activity sought to be taxed is illegal, individuals cannot be expected to voluntarily identify themselves as subject to
the tax. The Minnesota scheme cited by respondents provides for the
anonymous purchase of tax stamps prior to, and independent of, any criminal prosecution. Minn. Stat. $ 297D.01 et seq. (1992). Not surprisingly,
when asked at oral argument "Does Minnesota collect any money off that
scheme . . . Not too many stamps being sold?," counsel for respondents
admitted, amidst laughter, that he did not know the answer. Tr. of Oral

A second "unusual feature" identified by the Court is thatthe tax is levied on drugs that the taxpayer neither owns or

possesses at the time of taxation. But here, the Court ex-alts form over substance. Surely the Court is not suggesting that the State must permit the Kurths to keep the con-traband in order to tax its possession. Cf.

Constantine,supra, at 293 ("It would be strange if one carrying on a business the subject of an excise should be able to excuse himselffrom payment by the plea that in carrying on the business
he was violating the law"). And although Montana's "Dan-gerous Drug Tax" is described as a tax on storage and possession, it is clear from the structure and purpose of the Actthat it was passed for the legitimate purpose of raising revenue from the profitable underground drug business. 1987Mont. Laws, ch. 563 (preamble).

I do not dispute the Court's conclusion that an assessmentwhich is labeled a "tax" could, under some conceivable cir3 The preamble to the 1987 Montana Dangerous Drug Tax Act provides:
"WHEREAS, dangerous drugs are commodities having considerable
value, and the existence in Montana of a large and profitable dangerous
drug industry and expensive trade in dangerous drugs is irrefutable; and

"WHEREAS, the state does not endorse the manufacturing of or trading in dangerous drugs and does not consider the use of such drugs to be
acceptable, but it recognizes the economic impact upon the state of the
manufacturing and selling of dangerous drugs; and

"WHEREAS, it is appropriate that some of the revenue generated by
this tax be devoted to continuing investigative efforts directed toward the
identification, arrest, and prosecution of individuals involved in conducting
illegal continuing criminal enterprises that affect the distribution of dangerous drugs in Montana.

"THEREFORE, the Legislature of the State of Montana does not wish
to give credence to the notion that the manufacturing, selling, and use of
dangerous drugs is legal or otherwise proper, but finds it appropriate in
view of the economic impact of such drugs to tax those who profit from
drug-related offenses and to dispose of the tax proceeds through providing
additional anticrime initiatives without burdening law abiding taxpayers."

Funds collected from the tax are earmarked for youth evaluations,
chemical abuse assessment and aftercare, and juvenile detention facilities.

cumstances, constitute "punishment" for purposes of theDouble Jeopardy Clause. Ante, at 778, and n. 15, 779. The

Court made a similar finding in United States v. Constantine,supra, although in the context of a different sort of challenge. At issue in that case was the validity of a special$1,000 excise tax levied against all persons dealing in the
liquor business contrary to local law. Id., at 289, n. 1. Instriking down the tax as an unlawful penalty rather than a
tax, the Court noted that the assessment was conditioned onthe imposition of a crime, and that it was "highly exorbitant." Id., at 295.But the

Constantine factors are not persuasive in the pres-ent context. As discussed above, I do not find the conditioning of the tax on criminal conduct and arrest to be fatal tothis tax's validity; this characteristic simply reflects the reality of taxing an illegal enterprise. Furthermore, the rate oftaxation clearly supports petitioner here. In

Constantine,the special $1,000 excise tax on the sale of alcohol was 40

times as great when compared to the otherwise applicable$25 fee for retail liquor dealers such as respondent.

Ibid.When compared to the Montana tax, two points are noteworthy. First, unlike the situation in Constantine, no taxor fee is otherwise collected from individuals engaged in the
illicit drug business. Thus, an entire business goes withouttaxation. Second, the Montana tax is not as disproportionate as the additional excise tax in Constantine. The Courtmakes much of the fact that the bulk of the assessment--
that imposed on the low-grade "shake"--was more than eighttimes the market value of the drug.

Ante, at 780. But theCourt glosses over the fact that the tax imposed on the

higher quality "bud" amounted to only 80% of that product'smarket value.

4

4 The Kurths were taxed for their possession of 130 ounces of marijuana
"bud," a substance of higher quality than the marijuana "shake." The
Bankruptcy Court found that the bud had a market value of approximately

After averaging the effective tax rates on the two marijuana products, the Court concludes that Montana's tax rate
of four times the market value appears to be "unrivaled."
Ante, at 780, n. 17. That may be so. But the proper inquiry
is not whether the tax rate is "unrivaled," but whether it is
so high that it can only be explained as serving a punitive
purpose. When compared to similar types of "sin" taxes on
items such as alcohol and cigarettes, these figures are not so
high as to be deemed arbitrary or shocking. This is especially so given both the traditional deference accorded to
state authorities regarding matters of taxation, and the fact
that a substantial amount of the illegal drug business will
escape taxation altogether.5

In short, I think the Court's conclusion that the tax here
is a punishment is very much at odds with the purpose and
effect of the Montana statute, as well as our previous decisions. After reviewing the structure and language of the
tax provision and comparing the rate of taxation with similar
types of sin taxes imposed on lawful products, I would reach
the contrary conclusion--that the Montana tax has a nonpenal purpose of raising revenue, as well as the legitimate purpose of deterring conduct, such that it should be regarded as
a genuine tax for double jeopardy purposes.

$2,000 per pound. The product was taxed at a minimum rate of $100 per
ounce ($1,600 per pound), or 80% of market value.

5 The federal tax on cigarettes is currently at 1.2 cents per cigarette, or

24 cents per package. 26 U. S. C. $ 5701(b). While this does not exceed
the cost of a pack of cigarettes, the current proposal to boost the cigarette
tax to 99 cents per pack could lead to a total tax on cigarettes in some
jurisdictions at a rate higher than the 80% rate utilized in this case for
the marijuana bud. That the shake is taxed at a higher rate is consistent
with the effect of a fixed rate tax on a very low-quality, inexpensive product. See 26 U. S. C. $ 4131(b)(1) (fixed tax on vaccines, ranging from 6
cents to $4.56 per dose); 26 U. S. C. $ 4681 (1988 ed., Supp. IV) (fixed tax
on ozone-depleting chemicals).

KURTH RANCH

O'Connor, J., dissenting

Justice O'Connor, dissenting.
In an attempt to save their ranch from creditors, the ex-tended Kurth family turned to marijuana farming. "The

business expanded to the largest marijuana growing opera-tion in the State of Montana when shut down by law enforcement authorities in October, 1987." In re Kurth Ranch, 145B. R. 61, 66 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Mont. 1990). The Kurths were convicted and sentenced on various state drug charges.During the raid on the ranch, authorities found 1,811
ounces of harvested marijuana in the Kurths' possession.Under Montana law, "[t]here is a tax on the possession and
storage of dangerous drugs," and "each person possessing orstoring dangerous drugs is liable for the tax." Mont. Code
Ann. $ 15-25-111(1) (1987). In the case of marijuana, thetax is 10 percent of the market value of the drugs or $100
per ounce, whichever is greater. $ 15-25-111(2). Pursuantto this law, the Montana Department of Revenue assessed a
tax of $181,000 against the Kurths. The Kurths argue, andthe courts below agreed, that this tax is a second punishment
prohibited by the Double Jeopardy Clause. See Schiro v.
Farley, 510 U. S. 222, 229 (1994) (the Clause " `protects
against multiple punishments for the same offense,' " quoting
North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 717 (1969)).

The government may, of course, tax illegal activity. See,
e. g., Marchetti v. United States, 390 U. S. 39, 44 (1968). In
fact, we have upheld, as within Congress' taxing authority, a$100 per ounce tax on marijuana.

United States v. Sanchez,
340 U. S. 42, 44 (1950). But the power to tax illegal activitycarries with it the danger that the legislature will use the

tax to punish the participants for engaging in that activity.
This is particularly true of taxes assessed on the possessionof illegal drugs: Because most drug offenses involve the manufacture, possession, transportation, or distribution of con-trolled substances, the State might use a tax on possession
to punish a participant in a drug crime twice for the sameconduct. We would certainly examine a $100 per ounce

fine

levied against a person who had previously been convicted
and sentenced for marijuana possession for consistency with
the Double Jeopardy Clause. Cf. United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537, 548-549 (1943). Because in my
view there is no constitutional distinction between such a
fine and the tax at issue in this case, a tax imposed on the
possession of illegal drugs is subject to double jeopardy
analysis.

To hold, however, that Montana's drug tax is not exempt
from scrutiny under the Double Jeopardy Clause says nothing about whether imposition of the tax is unconstitutional.
"Congress may impose both a criminal and a civil sanction
in respect to the same act or omission; for the double jeopardy clause prohibits merely punishing twice, or attempting
a second time to punish criminally, for the same offense."
Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391, 399 (1938) (emphasis
added). The Fifth Amendment says "nor shall any person
be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy,"
and a civil proceeding following a criminal prosecution simply is not a second "jeopardy." See post, at 801, and n. 1
(Scalia, J., dissenting). But we have recognized that the
Constitution constrains the States' ability to denominate proceedings as "civil" and so dispense with the criminal procedure protections embodied in the Bill of Rights. See, e. g.,
Allen v. Illinois, 478 U. S. 364, 368-369 (1986). Some governmental exactions are so punitive that they may only be
imposed in a criminal proceeding. United States v. Ward,
448 U. S. 242, 248-249 (1980). And because the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits successive criminal proceedings for the
same offense, the government may not sanction a defendant
for conduct for which he has already been punished insofar
as the subsequent sanction is punitive, because to do so
would necessitate a criminal proceeding prohibited by the
Constitution. See generally United States v. Halper, 490
U. S. 435 (1989).

O'Connor, J., dissenting

The question, then, is whether Montana's drug tax is puni-tive. Our double jeopardy cases make clear that a civil sanction will be considered punishment to the extent that itserves only the purposes of retribution and deterrence, as
opposed to furthering any nonpunitive objective. Id., at
448-450. See also Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 539, n. 20(1979);

Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 168
(1963). This will obtain when, as in Halper, the amount ofthe sanction is "overwhelmingly disproportionate" to the

damages caused by the wrongful conduct and thus "is notrationally related to the goal of making the Government
whole." 490 U. S., at 449, 451.

The State and Federal Governments spend vast sums on
drug control activities. See, e. g., U. S. Dept. of Justice,
Bureau of Justice Statistics, Fact Sheet: Drug Data Summary 5 (Apr. 1994) (approximately $27 billion in fiscal year
1991). The Kurths are directly responsible for some of these
expenditures--the costs of detecting, investigating, and raiding their operation, the price of prosecuting them and incarcerating those who received prison sentences, and part of
the money spent on drug abuse education, deterrence, and
treatment. The State of Montana has a legitimate nonpunitive interest in defraying the costs of such activities.
United States v. Halper, supra, at 444-446, and n. 6; see also
United States v. Ward, supra, at 254; One Lot Emerald Cut
Stones v. United States, 409 U. S. 232, 237 (1972); Rex Trailer
Co. v. United States, 350 U. S. 148, 153-154 (1956). For example, readily available statistics indicate that apprehension,
prosecution, and incarceration of the Kurths will cost the
State of Montana at least $120,000. See Montana Board of
Crime Control, Per-Unit and Per-Transaction Expenditures
in the Montana Criminal Justice System 8, 15, 19, 21, 22-23,
and Tables 21 and 23 (1993) (Montana Criminal Justice
Expenditures).

But measuring the costs actually imposed by every participant in the illegal drug trade would be, to the extent it is

even possible, so complex as to make the game not worththe candle. Thus, the government must resort to approximation--in effect, it exacts liquidated damages. See Rex
Trailer Co. v. United States, supra, at 153-154 ("The damages resulting from [the government's] injury may be difficult or impossible to ascertain, but it is the function of liqui-dated damages to provide a measure of recovery in such

circumstances"); United States v. Halper, supra, at 452-453(

Kennedy, J., concurring) ("Our rule permits the imposition
in the ordinary case of at least a fixed penalty roughly pro-portionate to the damage caused or a reasonably liquidated

amount"). The Montana Legislature has determined that$100 per ounce of marijuana is an appropriate estimate of its
costs of drug control, and at least 22 other States have made
a similar determination and tax marijuana at approximatelythe same rate.*

The Court of Appeals recognized that imposition of the
drug tax on the Kurths' possession of marijuana would not
be punishment if the sanction bore some rational relationship
to "the staggering costs associated with fighting drug abuse
in this country." In re Kurth Ranch, 986 F. 2d 1308, 1312
(CA9 1993). But the court held that "allowing the state to

ing a penalty which Halper prohibits." Ibid. (emphasis
added). As evidenced by the highlighted phrase, the Court
of Appeals skipped a step in the double jeopardy analysis.
In Halper, we held that determining whether an exaction is
punitive entails a two-part inquiry:

"Where a defendant previously has sustained a criminal
penalty and the civil penalty sought in the subsequent
proceeding bears no rational relation to the goal of compensating the Government for its loss, but rather appears to qualify as `punishment' in the plain meaning of
the word, then the defendant is entitled to an accounting
of the Government's damages and costs to determine if
the penalty sought in fact constitutes a second punishment." 490 U. S., at 449-450 (emphasis added).

In other words, the defendant must first show the absence
of a rational relationship between the amount of the sanction
and the government's nonpunitive objectives; the burden
then shifts to the government to justify the sanction with
reference to the particular case. This bifurcated approach
to the double jeopardy question makes good sense. The presumption of constitutionality to which every state statute is
entitled means in this context that a sanction denominated
as civil must be presumed to be nonpunitive. This presumption would be rendered nugatory if the government were
required to prove that the sanction is in fact nonpunitive
before imposing it in a particular case. Rather, the defendant must show that the sanction may be punitive as applied
to him before the government can be required to justify its
imposition. As we emphasized in Halper, it will be the
"rare case" in which a litigant will succeed in satisfying the
first prong of the constitutional analysis. Id., at 449. We
do not know whether this is such a case because the courts
below improperly faulted the State for failing to prove its
actual damages even though the Kurths have not shown that

the amount of the tax is not rationally related to the govern-ment's legitimate nonpunitive objectives.

The Court avoids this problem by asserting that "[s]ub-jecting Montana's drug tax to

Halper's test for civil penalties
is . . . inappropriate." Ante, at 784. To reach this conclusion, the Court holds that imposition of the drug tax is always punitive, regardless of the nature of the offense or the
offender. The consequences of this decision are astounding.The State of Montana--along with about half of the other

States--is now precluded from ever imposing the drug taxon a person who has been punished for a possessory drug
offense. A defendant who is arrested, tried, and convicted
for possession of one ounce of marijuana cannot be taxed
$100 therefor, even though the State's law enforcement costs
in such a case average more than $4,000. See Montana
Criminal Justice Expenditures 24. Moreover, presumably
the State cannot tax anyone for possession of illegal drugs
without providing the full panoply of criminal procedure protections found in the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, given the
Court's holding that "[t]he proceeding Montana initiated to
collect a tax on the possession of drugs was the functional
equivalent of a successive criminal prosecution." Ibid.
See United States v. Ward, 448 U. S., at 248; post, at 807
(Scalia, J., dissenting).

Today's decision is entirely unnecessary to preserve individual liberty, because the Excessive Fines Clause is available to protect criminals from governmental overreaching.

The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment pro-vides: "nor shall any person be subject for the same offence

I
"To be put in jeopardy" does not remotely mean "to bepunished," so by its terms this provision prohibits, not multiple punishments, but only multiple prosecutions. Comparethe proposal of the House of Representatives, for which the
Senate substituted language similar to the current text ofthe Clause: "No person shall be subject, except in cases of
impeachment, to more than one punishment or one trial forthe same offence." See 1 Annals of Cong. 434, 753, 767
(1789); Senate Journal, Aug. 24, 1789, 1st Cong., 1st Sess.,105, 119, 130 (1789). The view that the Double Jeopardy
Clause does not prohibit multiple punishments is, as JusticeFrankfurter observed,

"confirmed by history. For legislation . . . providingtwo sanctions for the same misconduct, enforceable in
separate proceedings, one a conventional criminal prose-cution, and the other a forfeiture proceeding or a civil
action as upon a debt, was quite common when the FifthAmendment was framed by Congress. . . . It would do
violence to proper regard for the framers of the FifthAmendment to assume that they contemporaneously enacted and continued to enact legislation that was offen-sive to the guarantees of the double jeopardy clause

(1943) (concurring opinion).
The belief that there is a multiple-punishments componentof the Double Jeopardy Clause can be traced to

Ex parteLange, 18 Wall. 163 (1874). In that case, the lower court

sentenced Lange to both one year of imprisonment and a$200 fine for stealing mail bags from the Post Office, under
a statute that authorized a maximum sentence of one yearof imprisonment

or a fine not to exceed $200. The Court,acknowledging that the sentence was in excess of statutory

authorization, issued a writ of habeas corpus. Lange hassince been cited as though it were decided exclusively on the
basis of the Double Jeopardy Clause, see, e. g., North Caro-lina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 717, and n. 11 (1969); in fact,
Justice Miller's opinion for the Court rested the decision onprinciples of the common law, and both the Due Process and
Double Jeopardy Clauses of the Fifth Amendment. See
Lange, 18 Wall., at 170, 176, 178. The opinion went out ofits way not to rely exclusively on the Double Jeopardy

Clause, in order to avoid deciding whether it applied toprosecutions not literally involving "life or limb." See id.,
at 170. It is clear that the Due Process Clause alone sufficesto support the decision, since the guarantee of the process
provided by the law of the land, cf. Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co.v.

Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 28-29 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring injudgment), assures prior legislative authorization for whatever punishment is imposed.The basis for Lange was hardly clarified when, almost
three-quarters of a century later and in a case involvingnearly identical circumstances (a prisoner who had already
paid a $500 fine was sentenced to prison under a contemptstatute that permitted only a fine

or imprisonment), theCourt discharged the prisoner without express reference to

the Double Jeopardy Clause and with only a citation ofLange. See In re Bradley, 318 U. S. 50, 51-52 (1943). Chief

Justice Stone's dissent in Bradley displays his uncertaintyregarding the doctrinal basis for

Lange--as well as his view
that if the basis was the Double Jeopardy Clause it waswrong: "So far as

Ex parte Lange is regarded here as resting
on the ground that it would be double jeopardy to compel
the offender to serve the prison sentence after remission ofthe fine on the same day on which it was paid, I think its

authority should be reexamined and rejected." 318 U. S.,at 53.

Between Lange and our decision five Terms ago in United
States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435 (1989), our cases often stated
that the Double Jeopardy Clause protects against both successive prosecutions and successive punishments for the
same criminal offense. See, e. g., North Carolina v. Pearce,
supra, at 717; Illinois v. Vitale, 447 U. S. 410, 415 (1980);
Ohio v. Johnson, 467 U. S. 493, 498-499 (1984). But the repetition of a dictum does not turn it into a holding, and an
examination of the cases discussing the prohibition against
multiple punishments demonstrates that, until Halper, the
Court never invalidated a legislatively authorized successive punishment. The dispositions were entirely consistent
with the proposition that the restriction derived exclusively
from the due process requirement of legislative authorization. Indeed, some cases expressed the restriction in precisely that fashion. See, e. g., Johnson, supra, at 499, and
n. 8 ("[P]rotection against cumulative punishmen[t] is designed to ensure that the sentencing discretion of courts is
confined to the limits established by the legislature"); Albernaz v. United States, 450 U. S. 333, 344 (1981) ("[T]he question of what punishments are constitutionally permissible is
not different from the question of what punishments the
Legislative Branch intended to be imposed"); United States

id., at 697 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judg-ment) ("The only function the Double Jeopardy Clause

serves in cases challenging multiple punishments is to pre-vent the prosecutor from bringing more charges, and the
sentencing court from imposing greater punishments, thanthe Legislative Branch intended") (emphasis in original);
Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161, 165 (1977) ("The legislatureremains free under the Double Jeopardy Clause to define
crimes and fix punishments").To tell the truth, however, until

Halper was decided, ex-tending the "no-double-punishments" rule to civil penalties,

it did not much matter whether that rule was a freestandingconstitutional prohibition implicit in the Double Jeopardy
Clause or (as I think to be the case) merely an aspect of theDue Process Clause requirement of legislative authorization.
Even if it were thought to be the former, the Double Jeop-ardy Clause's ban on successive criminal prosecutions would
make surplusage of any distinct protection against additionalpunishment imposed in a

successive prosecution, since theprosecution itself would be barred.

1 (It has never been

imagined, of course, that the commonplace practice of impos-ing multiple authorized punishments--fine and incarceration--after a single prosecution is unconstitutional. See

1 Thus, in the context of criminal proceedings, legislatively authorized
multiple punishments are permissible if imposed in a single proceeding,
but impermissible if imposed in successive proceedings. See Missouri v.
Hunter, 459 U. S. 359, 368-369 (1983). United States v. Halper, 490 U. S.
435, 450 (1989), and the Court's opinion in the present case, see ante, at
778, attempt to preserve that distinction in the context of civil proceedings. But of course the textual basis for it--the Double Jeopardy Clause's
prohibition of successive prosecutions--does not exist: a civil proceeding
is not a second jeopardy. See infra, at 807-808.

DiFrancesco, supra, at 139.) But a civil proceeding succes-sive to a criminal prosecution is

not barred, even if (as in
Halper itself) it has the potential to result in the impositionof a penalty. See

United States v. One Assortment of 89
Firearms, 465 U. S. 354, 362 (1984); One Lot Emerald Cut
Stones v. United States, 409 U. S. 232, 235 (1972). Thus, byextending the no-double-punishments rule to civil penalties,

while simultaneously affirming that it demanded more thanmere fidelity to legislative intent,

Halper gave the rule a
breadth of effect it had never before enjoyed.

Halper involved a medical doctor who had already been
convicted and punished under the criminal false claims statute, 18 U. S. C. $ 287, for filing false medicare claims. The
issue was whether he could then be fined for the same false
claims under the civil provisions of the False Claims Act,
31 U. S. C. $$ 3729-3731. We held that the Double Jeopardy
Clause prevented it, to the extent that the fine exceeded
what was needed to cover " `legitimate nonpunitive governmental objectives,' " Halper, 490 U. S., at 448, quoting Bell v.
Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 539, n. 20 (1979). The Government's
contention in Halper was not that no constitutional prohibition on multiple punishments existed, but rather that it
applied only to punishments meted out in a criminal proceeding. See Brief for United States in United States v.
Halper, O. T. 1988, No. 87-1383, pp. 11-12, 21-24. I found,
and continue to find, that distinction incoherent: if the Constitution prohibits multiple punishments, the nature of the
proceeding in which punishment is imposed should make
no difference. Accordingly, I joined the Court's unanimous
opinion. I continued to apply the rule of Halper--indeed, I
thought I applied it more faithfully than the Court--in my
dissent the next month in Jones v. Thomas, 491 U. S. 376,
388, 393 (1989).

The difficulty of applying Halper's analysis to Montana's
Dangerous Drug Tax has prompted me to focus on the antecedent question whether there is a multiple-punishments

component of the Double Jeopardy Clause. As indicatedabove, I have concluded--as did Chief Justice Stone, see In

re Bradley, 318 U. S. 50 (1943), and Justice Frankfurter, seeUnited States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537 (1943)--
that there is not. Instead, the Due Process Clause keepspunishment within the bounds established by the legislature,
and the Cruel and Unusual Punishments and ExcessiveFines Clauses place substantive limits upon what those legislated bounds may be.2Of course the conviction that

Halper was in error is notalone enough to justify departing from it. But there is

added to that conviction the knowledge, acquired from briefexperience with the new regime, that the erroneous holding
produces results too strange for judges to endure, and regu-larly demands judgments of the most problematic sort. As
to the latter: We dodged the bullet in Halper--or perhaps amore precise metaphor would be that we thrust our lowercourt colleagues between us and the bullet--by leaving it tothe lower courts to determine at what particular dollar level
the civil fine exceeded the Government's "legitimate nonpu-nitive governmental objectives" and thus became a penalty.
See Halper, 490 U. S., at 452. In the present case, however,the alleged punishment is not an adjudicated fine that can be
judicially reduced to a lower level, but rather a tax; and sowe grapple with the different, though no less peculiar, inquiry: When is a tax so high (or so something-else) that it isa punishment? Surely further enigmas await us.

2 The Excessive Fines Clause--which was rescued from obscurity only
after Halper was decided, see Alexander v. United States, 509 U. S. 544,
558-559 (1993) (first Supreme Court case applying the Clause to in personam criminal proceedings); Austin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602, 606-

618 (1993) (Clause applies to civil forfeitures)--may well support the judgment in Halper. Indeed, it may even explain the judgment in Halper,
since much of the language of that opinion suggests that the Court was
motivated by concern for the harsh consequences of applying a pertransaction penalty to a "prolific but small-gauge offender," 490 U. S., at
449.

And we have also learned from experience that we are
unwilling to take the strong (and not particularly healthful)
medicine that we poured out for ourselves in Halper. Jones
was the first lesson, but even sterner ones are in store. In
the present case, as in Halper itself, we confront the relatively easy task of disallowing a civil sanction because criminal punishment has already been imposed. But many
cases, including one being held for this case, will demand
much more of us: disallowing criminal punishment because
a civil sanction has already been imposed. Although at
least one lower court has optimistically suggested (without
elaborating) that there might be a constitutional difference
between the two situations, see United States v. Newby, 11
F. 3d 1143 (CA3 1993), if there is a constitutional prohibition
on multiple punishments, the order of punishment cannot
possibly make any difference. Accord, United States v.
Sanchez-Escareno, 950 F. 2d 193, 200 (CA5 1991). The social
cost of vindicating the fictional, Halper-created multiplepunishments prohibition will be much higher when criminal
penalties are at stake, and we will be no more willing to pay
it (nor should we) than the lower courts have been. Can a
prison inmate who has been disciplined for an altercation
with a guard subsequently be punished criminally for the
same incident? See Newby, supra, at 1145-1146 (answering
yes). Can a person who has paid a $75,000 fine and been
permanently disbarred from commodity trading because of
trading violations subsequently be sent to jail for the same
violations? See United States v. Furlett, 974 F. 2d 839 (CA7
1992) (answering yes). Can a person who has suffered civil
forfeiture for violation of law later be prosecuted criminally
for the same violation? See United States v. Tilley, 18 F.
3d 295 (CA5 1994) (answering yes).

It is time to put the Halper genie back in the bottle, and
to acknowledge what the text of the Constitution makes perfectly clear: the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits successive

prosecution, not successive punishment. Multiple punish-ment is of course restricted by the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause insofar as its nature is concerned, and bythe Excessive Fines Clause insofar as its cumulative extent
is concerned. Its multiplicity qua multiplicity, however, isrestricted only by the Double Jeopardy Clause's requirement
that there be no successive criminal prosecution, and by theDue Process Clause's requirement that the cumulative punishments be in accord with the law of the land, i. e., author-ized by the legislature.

II
The Court's entire opinion appears to proceed on theassumption that the relevant question is whether taxes

assessed pursuant to Montana's Dangerous Drug Tax Act"violate the constitutional prohibition against successive
punishments for the same offense." Ante, at 769. Nonethe-less, after 16 pages addressing how Montana's marijuana
tax inflicts punishment, the Court adds, almost as an after-thought: "The proceeding Montana initiated to collect a tax
on the possession of drugs was the functional equivalent ofa successive criminal prosecution that placed the Kurths
in jeopardy a second time `for the same offence.' " Ante,at 784.

The only conceivable foundation for that statement is theimplicit assumption that any proceeding which imposes "punishment" within the meaning of the multiple-punishmentscomponent of the Double Jeopardy Clause is a criminal
prosecution. That assumption parts company with a longline of cases, including

Halper, without even the courtesy of
a goodbye. Although a few of our cases include statements
to the effect that a proceeding in which punishment is im-posed is criminal, see,

e. g., Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez,
372 U. S. 144, 167 (1963), the criterion of "punishment" for
that purpose is significantly different (and significantly more
deferential to the government) than the criterion applied in

Halper. United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242 (1980), put itthis way:

"[W]here Congress has indicated an intention to estab-lish a civil penalty, we have inquired further whether
the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purposeor effect as to negate that intention. In regard to this
latter inquiry, we have noted that `only the clearestproof could suffice to establish the unconstitutionality of
a statute on such a ground.' " Id., at 248-249, quoting
Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 617 (1960) (citationomitted).

Halper's focus on whether the sanction serves the goalsof "retribution and deterrence" is just one factor in the
Kennedy-Ward test, see 372 U. S., at 168-169, and one factoralone is not dispositive, see Ward, supra, at 250-251.

The greater severity of the "criminal prosecution" testis in fact precisely why Halper resorted to the multiplepunishments component of the Double Jeopardy Clause.The opinion distinguished between the test used to determine "whether proceedings are criminal or civil," 490 U. S.,at 447, and the more searching analysis thought appropriate
in the multiple-punishments context:

"The Government correctly observes that this Court hasfollowed this abstract [Kennedy-Ward] approach when

determining whether the procedural protections of theSixth Amendment apply to proceedings under a given
statute, in affixing the appropriate standard of proof forsuch proceedings, and in determining whether double
jeopardy protections should be applied. See United
States v. Ward, 448 U. S., at 248-251. But while re-course to statutory language, structure, and intent is

appropriate in identifying the inherent nature of a pro-ceeding, or in determining the constitutional safeguards
that must accompany those proceedings as a general

matter, the approach is not well suited to the context ofthe `humane interests' safeguarded by the Double Jeopardy Clause's proscription of multiple punishments."Ibid.

The Court not only ignores the Kennedy-Ward test andthis portion of

Halper, it also does not attempt to reconcile
its conclusion with our decision in Helvering v. Mitchell, 303U. S. 391 (1938):

"Forfeiture of goods or their value and the payment offixed or variable sums of money are other sanctions
which have been recognized as enforcible [sic] by civilproceedings since the original revenue law of 1789. In
spite of their comparative severity, such sanctions havebeen upheld against the contention that they are essentially criminal and subject to the procedural rules
governing criminal prosecutions." Id., at 400 (citationomitted) (citing cases).

Of course, if the Court were correct that the proceeding
below was criminal in nature, there would be no particularreason to refer to this as a double jeopardy case. Assessment of a criminal punishment in a civil tax proceeding
would violate not only the Double Jeopardy Clause, but allof the criminal-procedure guarantees of the Fifth and Sixth

Amendments. And it would be invalid whether or not it waspreceded by a traditional criminal prosecution. The Court's
assertion that it would be lawful in isolation, see ante, at778-779, thus contradicts the Court's contention that it is
"the functional equivalent of a . . . criminal prosecution,"
ante, at 784.

Applying the Kennedy-Ward test to the Montana tax proceeding, I do not find that it constituted a second criminalprosecution. And since the Montana Legislature authorized

of due process sometimes called the multiple-punishmentscomponent of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The Constitution requires nothing more. For these reasons, I respect-fully dissent.

KEY TRONIC CORP. v. UNITED STATES et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 93-376. Argued March 29, 1994--Decided June 6, 1994
Petitioner Key Tronic Corporation, one of several parties responsible for

contaminating a landfill, settled a lawsuit filed by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) and then brought this action against the Air
Force and other responsible parties to recover a share of its cleanup
costs, including attorney's fees for legal services in connection with (1)
the identification of other potentially responsible parties (PRP's), (2) the
preparation and negotiation of the settlement agreement with the EPA,
and (3) the prosecution of this litigation. The District Court held, inter
alia, that all of the attorney's fees were recoverable under $ 107 of the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and
Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA). The Court of Appeals disagreed
as to each type of fees and reversed.

Held: CERCLA $ 107 does not provide for the award of private litigants'

attorney's fees associated with bringing a cost recovery action.
Pp. 814-821.

(a) Under the longstanding "American rule," attorney's fees generally are not a recoverable cost of litigation absent explicit congressional
authorization. See, e. g., Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness
Society, 421 U. S. 240. The relevant provisions of CERCLA do not
expressly mention the recovery of such fees, although $ 107(a)(4)(B)
imposes private liability for the "necessary costs of response" to the
release of a hazardous substance, while $ 101(25), as amended by SARA,
defines "response" to include "enforcement activities." Pp. 814-816.

(b) The fees for prosecuting this action against the Air Force are not
recoverable "necessary costs of response" under $ 107(a)(4)(B) because
the "enforcement activities" included in $ 101(25) do not encompass a
private party's action to recover cleanup costs from other PRP's. First,
although $ 107 unquestionably provides such a cause of action, that cause
is not explicitly set out in the section's text, but was inferred in numerous District Court cases interpreting the statute. To conclude that a
provision that only impliedly authorizes suit nonetheless provides for
attorney's fees with the clarity required by Alyeska would be unprecedented. Second, Congress' inclusion of two express fee awards provisions elsewhere in the SARA amendments, and its omission of a similar

810 KEY TRONIC CORP. v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
provision either in $ 107 or in $ 113, which expressly authorizes contribution claims, strongly suggest a deliberate decision not to authorize such
awards in the kind of private cost recovery action that is at issue.
Third, it would stretch the plain terms of the phrase "enforcement
activities" too far to construe it as encompassing such an action.
Pp. 816-819.

(c) Unlike litigation-related fees, the component of Key Tronic's claim
covering activities performed in identifying other PRP's constitutes a
"necessary cos[t] of response" recoverable under $ 107(a)(4)(B). Such
work might well be performed by engineers, chemists, private investigators, or other professionals who are not lawyers, and fees for its performance are clearly distinguishable from litigation expenses governed
by the American rule under Alyeska. The District Court recognized
the role such efforts played in uncovering the Air Force's disposal of
wastes at the site and in prompting the EPA to initiate enforcement
action against the Air Force. Tracking down other responsible solvent
polluters increases the probability that a cleanup will be effective and
get paid for. Key Tronic is therefore quite right to claim that these
activities significantly benefited the entire cleanup effort and served a
statutory purpose apart from the reallocation of costs. Pp. 819-820.

(d) However, fees for the legal services performed in connection with
the negotiations between Key Tronic and the EPA that culminated in
the consent decree do not constitute "necessary costs of response." Although studies that Key Tronic's counsel prepared or supervised during
those negotiations may indeed have aided the EPA and may also have
affected the cleanup's ultimate scope and form, such work must be
viewed as primarily protecting Key Tronic's interests as a defendant in
the proceedings that established the extent of its liability. Pp. 820-821.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
Petitioner Key Tronic Corporation, one of several partiesresponsible for contaminating a landfill, brought this action

to recover a share of its cleanup costs from other responsi-ble parties. The question presented is whether attorney's
fees are "necessary costs of response" within the meaningof $ 107(a)(4)(B) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA),as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), 100 Stat. 1613, and therefore re-coverable in such an action.

I
During the 1970's Key Tronic and other parties, includingthe United States Air Force, disposed of liquid chemicals at

the Colbert Landfill in eastern Washington State. In 1980the Washington Department of Ecology (WDOE) determined
that the water supply in the surrounding area had beencontaminated by these chemicals. Various lawsuits ensued,
including formal proceedings against Key Tronic, the AirForce, and other parties.

Two of those proceedings were settled. In one settlementwith WDOE and the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), Key Tronic agreed to contribute $4.2 million to anEPA cleanup fund. In the other, the Air Force agreed to
pay the EPA $1.45 million. The EPA subsequently releasedthe Air Force from further liability pursuant to CERCLA

party that has resolved its liability to the United States shallnot be liable for contribution claims regarding matters addressed in the settlement.1Key Tronic thereafter brought this action against the
United States and other parties seeking to recover part ofits $4.2 million commitment to the EPA in a contribution
claim under CERCLA $ 113(f ), 42 U. S. C. $ 9613(f ), and seek-ing an additional $1.2 million for response costs that it incurred before the settlements in a cost recovery claim underCERCLA $ 107(a)(4)(B), 42 U. S. C. $ 9607(a)(4)(B). The $1.2
million included attorney's fees for three types of legal serv-ices: (1) the identification of other potentially responsible
parties (PRP's), including the Air Force, that were liable forthe cleanup; (2) preparation and negotiation of its agreement
with the EPA; and (3) the prosecution of this litigation.2The District Court dismissed Key Tronic's $4.2 million
contribution claim against the Air Force when Key Tronicconceded that $ 122(g)(5) precluded it from recovering any
part of the consent decree obligation.3 Key Tronic's claimfor $1.2 million of additional response costs could be pursued
under CERCLA $ 107(a)(4)(B), 42 U. S. C. $ 9607, the courtheld, because it related to matters not covered by the Air

1 See Administrative Order on Consent and Interagency Agreement || 8,
p. 12 (Record, Doc. No. 23, Exh. 1). Paragraph 7(a) of that agreement
defines the term "Covered Matters" to include "any and all civil liability
for reimbursement of response costs or for injunctive relief pursuant to
sections 106 or 107(a) of CERCLA, 42 U. S. C. 9606 or 9607(a), or section
7003 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, 42
U. S. C. 6973, with regard to the Site."

2 Key Tronic also sought prejudgment interest against the United

States. The District Court awarded such interest, and the Air Force did
not appeal that award. Other payments the Air Force made to Key
Tronic are not in dispute.

3 The statutory bar protected only the Air Force from liability. Key

Tronic's claim against another defendant, Alumax Fabricated Products,
Inc., and Alumax Mill Products, Inc. (collectively Alumax), was deemed
moot when the two parties settled. 766 F. Supp. 865, 867-868 (ED
Wash. 1991).

Force's settlement with the EPA. 766 F. Supp. 865, 868(ED Wash. 1991). Section 107(a) provides that responsible

parties are liable for "any . . . necessary costs of responseincurred by any other person consistent with the national
contingency plan." 4 42 U. S. C. $ 9607(a)(4)(B). CERCLA'sdefinitional $ 101(25), as amended by SARA, provides that
"response" or "respond" "means remove, removal, remedy,and remedial action" and that "all such terms (including the
terms `removal' and `remedial action') include enforcementactivities related thereto." 42 U. S. C. $ 9601(25). Construing $$ 107 and 101(25) "liberally to achieve the overall objectives of the statute," 766 F. Supp., at 872, the District Courtconcluded that a private party may incur enforcement costs

and that such costs include attorney's fees for bringing a cost
recovery action under $ 107. Id., at 871. The court wenton to decide that attorney's fees encompassed within Key

Tronic's PRP search costs also were recoverable as an en-forcement activity under CERCLA,

id., at 872, and that the
costs Key Tronic's attorneys incurred in negotiating theagreement with the EPA were recoverable as necessary

response costs under $ 107.5The Court of Appeals reversed. 984 F. 2d 1025, 1028 (CA9
1993). Relying on its decision in Stanton Road Associatesv.

Lohrey Enterprises, 984 F. 2d 1015 (CA9 1993), which prohibited a litigant in a private response cost recovery actionfrom obtaining attorney's fees from a party responsible for

the pollution, the court held that the District Court lackedauthority to award attorney's fees in this case. 984 F. 2d,

precluded an award of attorney's fees for Key Tronic's search

5 The court indicated that these expenses were necessary response costs

within the meaning of $ 107(a)(4)(B) regardless of whether they constituted
costs of " `enforcement activities' " under $ 101(25). 766 F. Supp., at 872.

for other responsible parties and for negotiating the consentdecree. "Because Congress has not explicitly authorized

private litigants to recover their legal expenses incurred ina private cost recovery action," the District Court's award
of attorney's fees could not stand. 984 F. 2d, at 1028.Judge Canby dissented, reasoning that Congress' 1986
amendment of the definition of "response" meant to author-ize the recovery of attorney's fees even in private litigants'
cost recovery actions. Ibid.Other courts addressing this question have differed over
the extent to which attorney's fees are a necessary cost ofresponse under CERCLA. See

As its name implies, CERCLA is a comprehensive statutethat grants the President broad power to command government agencies and private parties to clean up hazardouswaste sites. Sections 104 and 106 provide the framework
for federal abatement and enforcement actions that the Pres-ident, the EPA as his delegated agent, or the Attorney General initiates. 42 U. S. C. $$ 9604, 9606. These actions typi-cally require private parties to incur substantial costs in
removing hazardous wastes and responding to hazardousconditions. Section 107 sets forth the scope of the liabilities
that may be imposed on private parties and the defenses thatthey may assert. 42 U. S. C. $ 9607.

(1976) (citing Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S. 240, 247 (1975)). Recognition of the availability of attorney's fees therefore requires a determination
that "Congress intended to set aside this longstanding American rule of law." Runyon, 427 U. S., at 185-186. Neither
CERCLA $ 107, the liabilities and defenses provision, nor

$ 113, which authorizes contribution claims, expressly mentions the recovery of attorney's fees. The absence of specific
reference to attorney's fees is not dispositive if the statute
otherwise evinces an intent to provide for such fees. The
Eighth Circuit, for example, found "a sufficient degree of
explicitness" in CERCLA's references to "necessary costs of
response" and "enforcement activities" to warrant the award
of attorney's fees and expenses.6 Mere "generalized commands," however, will not suffice to authorize such fees. Id.,
at 186.

The three components of Key Tronic's claim for attorney's
fees raise somewhat different issues. We first consider
whether the fees for prosecuting this action against the Air
Force are recoverable under CERCLA. That depends,
again, upon whether the "enforcement activities" included in

$ 101(25)'s definition of "response" encompass a private party's action to recover cleanup costs from other PRP's such

6 See General Electric Co. v. Litton Industrial Automation Systems,
Inc., 920 F. 2d 1415, 1421-1422 (1990). After setting out the relevant language of $$ 107(a)(4)(B) and 101(25), the court concluded that a private
party cost-recovery action is an enforcement activity within the meaning
of the statute, that attorney's fees "necessarily are incurred in this kind
of enforcement activity," and that "it would strain the statutory language
to the breaking point to read them out of the `necessary costs' that section
9607(a)(4)(B) allows private parties to recover." Ibid. The court's subsequent conclusion that CERCLA authorizes private parties to recover attorney's fees was "based on the statutory language" and was "consistent
with two of the main purposes of CERCLA--prompt cleanup of hazardous
waste sites and imposition of all cleanup costs on the responsible party."

Opinion of the Court
that the attorney's fees associated with that action are then"necessary costs of response" within $ 107(a)(4)(B).

III
The 1986 amendments to CERCLA are the genesis of theterm "enforcement activities"; we begin, therefore, by considering the statutory basis for the claim in the originalCERCLA enactment and the SARA provisions' effect on it.
In its original form CERCLA contained no express provisionauthorizing a private party that had incurred cleanup costs
to seek contribution from other PRP's. In numerous cases,however, District Courts interpreted the statute--particularly the $ 107 provisions outlining the liabilities and de-fenses of persons against whom the Government may assert
claims--to impliedly authorize such a cause of action.7The 1986 amendments included a provision--CERCLA

$ 113(f)--that expressly created a cause of action for contri-bution. See 42 U. S. C. $ 9613(f). Other SARA provisions,
moreover, appeared to endorse the judicial decisions recog-nizing a cause of action under $ 107 by presupposing that
such an action existed. An amendment to $ 107 itself, forexample, refers to "amounts recoverable in an action under
this section." 42 U. S. C. $ 9607(a)(4)(D). The new contri-bution section also contains a reference to a "civil action . . .
under section 9607(a)." 42 U. S. C. $ 9613(f)(1). Thus thestatute now expressly authorizes a cause of action for contribution in $ 113 and impliedly authorizes a similar and some-what overlapping remedy in $ 107.

7 In Walls v. Waste Resource Corp., 761 F. 2d 311 (CA6 1985), Judge
Merritt noted that District Courts "have been virtually unanimous" in
holding that $ 107(a)(4)(B) creates a private right of action for the recovery
of necessary response costs. Id., at 318 (citing Bulk Distribution Centers,
Inc. v. Monsanto Co., 589 F. Supp. 1437, 1442-1444 (SD Fla. 1984); Jones

Opinion of the Court
As we have said, neither $ 107 nor $ 113 expressly calls forthe recovery of attorney's fees by the prevailing party. In

contrast, two SARA provisions contain explicit authority forthe award of attorney's fees. A new provision authorizing
private citizens to bring suit to enforce the statute, see 100Stat. 1704-1705, expressly authorizes the award of "reasonable attorney and expert witness fees" to the prevailingparty. 42 U. S. C. $ 9659(f). And an amendment to the section authorizing the Attorney General to bring abatementactions provides that a person erroneously ordered to pay
response costs may in some circumstances recover counselfees from the Government. See $ 9606(b)(2)(E).

8 Since its

enactment CERCLA also has expressly authorized the re-covery of fees in actions brought by employees claiming discriminatory treatment based on their disclosure of statutoryviolations. See $ 9610(c) ("aggregate amount of all costs and
expenses (including the attorney's fees)" is recoverable).Judicial decisions, rather than explicit statutory text, also
resolved an issue that arose frequently under the originalversion of CERCLA--that is, whether the award in a government enforcement action seeking to recover cleanup costscould encompass its litigation expenses, including attorney's
fees. Here, too, District Courts generally agreed that suchfees were recoverable.

9 Congress arguably endorsed these

holdings, as well, in the SARA provision redefining the term"response" to include related "enforcement activities," 100

8 Under this section, the reimbursement that a court awards "may include appropriate costs, fees, and other expenses" in accordance with 28
U. S. C. $$ 2412(a) and (d), which outline the procedures by which costs and
fees are awarded. Section 2412(d)(2)(A), in particular, defines "fees and
other expenses" to include reasonable attorney's fees.

818 KEY TRONIC CORP. v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Stat. 1615.10 Key Tronic contends that a private action
under $ 107 is one of the enforcement activities covered by
that definition and that fees should therefore be available in
private litigation as well as in government actions.

For three reasons, we are unpersuaded. First, although

$ 107 unquestionably provides a cause of action for private
parties to seek recovery of cleanup costs, that cause of action
is not explicitly set out in the text of the statute.11 To conclude that a provision that only impliedly authorizes suit
nonetheless provides for attorney's fees with the clarity required by Alyeska would be unusual if not unprecedented.
Indeed, none of our cases has authorized fee awards to prevailing parties in such circumstances.

Second, Congress included two express provisions for fee
awards in SARA without including a similar provision in
either $ 113, which expressly authorizes contribution claims,
or in $ 107, which impliedly authorizes private parties to
recover cleanup costs from other PRP's. These omissions

10 According to the House Committee Report on this amendment,

$ 101(25)'s modification of the definition of "response action" to include related enforcement activities "will confirm the EPA's authority to recover
costs for enforcement actions taken against responsible parties." H. R.
Rep. No. 99-253, pp. 66-67 (1985).

11 Justice Scalia correctly notes that "to say that A shall be liable to

B is the express creation of a right of action." Post, at 822. Section 107,
however, merely says that "A shall be liable" without revealing to whom
A is liable. Sections 104 and 106 plainly indicate that the parties described in $ 107 are liable to the Government. The statute thus expressly
identifies the Government as a potential plaintiff and only impliedly identifies private parties as the hypothetical B in $ 107 litigation. That $ 107
imposes liability on A for costs incurred "by any other person" implies--
but does not expressly command--that A may have a claim for contribution against those treated as joint tortfeasors. Cf. Texas Industries, Inc.
v. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U. S. 630, 639-640 (1981) (finding no implied right to contribution from other participants in conspiracy violative
of antitrust laws); Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers, 451 U. S.
77, 91-95 (1981) (finding no implied right to contribution under the Equal
Pay Act of 1963 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964).

Opinion of the Court
strongly suggest a deliberate decision not to authorize suchawards.

Third, we believe it would stretch the plain terms of thephrase "enforcement activities" too far to construe it as encompassing the kind of private cost recovery action at issuein this case. Though we offer no comment on the extent
to which that phrase forms the basis for the Government'srecovery of attorney's fees through $ 107, the term "enforcement activity" is not sufficiently explicit to embody a privateaction under $ 107 to recover cleanup costs.

12 Given our adherence to a general practice of not awarding fees to a pre-vailing party absent explicit statutory authority,

AlyeskaPipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U. S., at 262,

we conclude that CERCLA $ 107 does not provide for theaward of private litigants' attorney's fees associated with
bringing a cost recovery action.13

IV
The conclusion we reach with respect to litigation-relatedfees does not signify that all payments that happen to be made

12 That characterization undeniably applies to citizen suits brought by
private parties under $ 310 seeking affirmative relief. Significantly, Congress expressly authorized fee awards in such cases. See 42 U. S. C.

$ 9659(f).

13 In concluding that a private party may not recover attorney's fees

arising from the litigation of a private recovery action, the Tenth Circuit
observed: "We simply cannot agree with those courts that find an explicit
authorization for the award of litigation fees from the fact that response
costs include related enforcement activities. We recognize that CERCLA
is designed to encourage private parties to assume the financial responsibility of cleanup by allowing them to seek recovery from others. It may
be true that awarding the litigation fees incurred in that recovery would
further this goal. Nonetheless, the efficacy of an exception to the American rule is a policy decision that must be made by Congress, not the courts.
The desirability of a fee-shifting provision cannot substitute for the express authorization mandated by the Supreme Court." FMC Corp v.
Aero Industries, Inc., 998 F. 2d 842, 847 (1993) (citing Alyeska, 421 U. S.,
at 263-264).

Opinion of the Court
to a lawyer are unrecoverable expenses under CERCLA.On the contrary, some lawyers' work that is closely tied to

the actual cleanup may constitute a necessary cost of re-sponse in and of itself under the terms of $ 107(a)(4)(B). The
component of Key Tronic's claim that covers the work per-formed in identifying other PRP's falls in this category. Unlike the litigation services at issue in Alyeska, these effortsmight well be performed by engineers, chemists, private investigators, or other professionals who are not lawyers. Asthe Tenth Circuit observed, the American rule set out in
Alyeska does not govern such fees "because they are notincurred in pursuing litigation."

FMC Corp. v. Aero Industries, Inc., 998 F. 2d 842, 847 (1993).The District Court in this case recognized the role Key

Tronic's search for other responsible parties played in uncov-ering the Air Force's disposal of wastes at the site and in
prompting the EPA to initiate its enforcement action againstthe Air Force. 766 F. Supp., at 872, n. 4. Tracking down
other responsible solvent polluters increases the probabilitythat a cleanup will be effective and get paid for. Key Tronic
is therefore quite right to claim that such efforts significantlybenefited the entire cleanup effort and served a statutory
purpose apart from the reallocation of costs. These kindsof activities are recoverable costs of response clearly distinguishable from litigation expenses.14This reasoning does not extend, however, to the legal services performed in connection with the negotiations betweenKey Tronic and the EPA that culminated in the consent decree. Studies that Key Tronic's counsel prepared or super-vised during those negotiations may indeed have aided the
EPA and may also have affected the ultimate scope and formof the cleanup. We nevertheless view such work as primarily protecting Key Tronic's interests as a defendant in theproceedings that established the extent of its liability. As

14 As is customary in assessments of this sort, of course, trial courts will
determine the exact amount of these costs that is recoverable.

such, these services do not constitute "necessary costs ofresponse" and are not recoverable under CERCLA.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in partand reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Blackmun and
Justice Thomas join, dissenting in part.

I disagree with the Court's conclusion that a private liti-gant cannot recover the attorney's fees associated with

bringing a cost recovery action under $ 107 of the Compre-hensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), 42 U. S. C. $ 9607. Under$$ 107(a)(4)(A) and (B), a party who has incurred costs to
clean up a hazardous waste site can recover those costs fromany other party liable under CERCLA. Those provisions
state that:

"Covered persons . . . shall be liable for--"(A) all costs of removal or remedial action incurred

by the United States Government or a State or anIndian tribe not inconsistent with the national contingency plan;"(B)

any other necessary costs of response incurredby any other person consistent with the national contingency plan." (Emphases added.)
Title 42 U. S. C. $ 9601(25) explains that:

"The terms `respond' or `response' means [sic] re-move, removal, remedy, and remedial action;

all such
terms (including the terms `removal' and `remedial ac-tion') include enforcement activities related thereto."

(Emphases added; footnote omitted.)
Under the plain language of these provisions, a privatelitigant is entitled to the costs associated with bringing

a $ 107(a)(4)(B) cost recovery action, which is the only

822 KEY TRONIC CORP. v. UNITED STATES

Scalia, J., dissenting in part
"enforcement activit[y]" he can conceivably conduct. Obviously, attorney's fees will constitute the major portion of
those enforcement costs.

The Court seeks to characterize the right of recovery created by $ 107 as an "implied" right of action, see ante, at
816, 818, and n. 11--perhaps in order to support the view
that the authorization of attorney's fees included within that
right of action is not explicit (a point I shall discuss more
fully below). That characterization is mistaken. Section
107(a)(4)(B) states, as clearly as can be, that "[c]overed persons . . . shall be liable for . . . necessary costs of response
incurred by any other person." Surely to say that A shall
be liable to B is the express creation of a right of action.*
Moreover, other language in $ 107 of CERCLA refers to
"amounts recoverable in an action under this section,"
42 U. S. C. $ 9607(a)(4)(D), and language in $ 113 discusses
the "civil action . . . under section 9607(a) [i. e., $ 107(a) of
CERCLA]," 42 U. S. C. $ 9613(f)(1). The Court's assumption
seems to be that only a statute that uses the very term
"cause of action" can create an "express" cause of action, and
that all other causes of action are "implied." That is not
ordinary usage. An implied cause of action is something
quite different from what we have here. See, e. g., Central
Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver,
N. A., ante, at 171 (discussing the genesis of the implied private causes of action under $$ 10(b) and 14(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934).

*I cannot agree with Justice Stevens's contention that CERCLA "expressly identifies the Government as a potential plaintiff and only impliedly identifies private parties" as potential plaintiffs in $ 107 litigation.
Ante, at 818, n. 11. Section 107(a)(4)(A) states that persons are liable for
certain costs "incurred by the United States Government or a State or an
Indian Tribe," thus providing an express cause of action for those plaintiffs. Section 107(a)(4)(B) states that persons are liable for certain costs
"incurred by any other person" (emphasis added), thus providing an express cause of action for private parties.

Scalia, J., dissenting in part
The first of the three reasons the Court gives for refusingto read $$ 9607(a)(4)(B) and 9601(25) to cover attorney's fees

displays the same confusion between a requirement of explic-itness and a requirement of a password. The Court states
that "attorney's fees generally are not . . . recoverable . . .
`absent explicit congressional authorization,' " ante, at 814(quoting

Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 185 (1976), and
notes further that none of the statutory provisions at issue"expressly mentions the recovery of attorney's fees,"

ante,
at 815. But to meet the demands of Runyon, Congress needonly be explicit--it need not incant the magic phrase "attorney's fees." Where, as here, Congress has explicitly authorized recovery of costs of "enforcement activities," and where,
as here, the costs of "enforcement activities" naturally (and
indeed primarily) include attorney's fees, that textual authorization satisfies Runyon.

The Court also draws a negative inference from the fact
that Congress expressly provided for attorney's fee awards
in other portions of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 1613, the Act that
added the "enforcement activities" language of 42 U. S. C.

$ 9601(25). From this, the Court concludes that Congress's
failure to mention attorney's fees in $ 9607 or $ 9613 "strongly
suggest[s] a deliberate decision not to authorize such
awards." Ante, at 819. That argument would be persuasive if it were ambiguous whether, for a private party, the
cost of "enforcement activities" includes attorney's fees.
But since it is not, the fact that Congress provided for the
recovery of attorney's fees eo nomine in two other sections
is of little relevance. Given the explicitness of the award of
costs of "enforcement activities," the " `attorney's fees' was
used elsewhere" argument is simply a watered-down version
of the "magic words" argument rejected above.

Finally, the Court comes to grips with the core issue in
this case, declaring that "it would stretch the plain terms of
the phrase `enforcement activities' too far to construe it as

encompassing the kind of private cost recovery action atissue in this case." Ibid. I do not agree. While the term

"enforcement" often--perhaps even usually--is used in con-nection with government prosecution, that is assuredly not
the only form of legal action it refers to. It clearly includesthe assertion of a valid private claim against another private
litigant. Lawyers regularly speak of "enforceable obliga-tions" and "enforceable contracts," and of "enforcing" a private judgment. We have called the private rights of actioncreated by the Clayton Act "vehicle[s] for private enforcement" of the law, Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colo., Inc., 479U. S. 104, 109 (1986), and the "private enforcement" characterization seems especially apt here, where the plaintiff 'ssuit must be "consistent with the national contingency plan"
promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency. 42U. S. C. $ 9607(a)(4)(B). As I read the Court's opinion, it interprets "enforcement activities" to cover, at most, the gov-ernment's attorney's fees in a cost recovery action. See
ante, at 819. That gives the specification of $ 9601(25) thatcertain terms include "enforcement activities"

no applicationto private parties, and no application to any terms except

"removal" and "remedial action"--which is very curious,since the parenthetical in $ 9601(25) suggests that those two
terms, far from being central to the provision (much less anembodiment of its total application), were in danger of
being overlooked.I would read "enforcement activities" in $ 9601(25) to cover
the attorney's fees incurred by both the government andprivate plaintiffs successfully seeking cost recovery under

$ 9607 of CERCLA.

FARMER v. BRENNAN, WARDEN, et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 92-7247. Argued January 12, 1994--Decided June 6, 1994
Petitioner, a preoperative transsexual who projects feminine characteristics, has been incarcerated with other males in the federal prison system, sometimes in the general prison population but more often in segregation. Petitioner claims to have been beaten and raped by another
inmate after being transferred by respondent federal prison officials
from a correctional institute to a penitentiary--typically a higher security facility with more troublesome prisoners--and placed in its general
population. Filing an action under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, petitioner sought damages and an injunction barring future confinement in any penitentiary, and alleged that
respondents had acted with "deliberate indifference" to petitioner's
safety in violation of the Eighth Amendment because they knew that
the penitentiary had a violent environment and a history of inmate assaults and that petitioner would be particularly vulnerable to sexual
attack. The District Court granted summary judgment to respondents,
denying petitioner's motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f)
to delay its ruling until respondents complied with a discovery request.
It concluded that failure to prevent inmate assaults violates the Eighth
Amendment only if prison officials were "reckless in a criminal sense,"
i. e., had "actual knowledge" of a potential danger, and that respondents
lacked such knowledge because petitioner never expressed any safety
concerns to them. The Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held:

1. A prison official may be held liable under the Eighth Amendment
for acting with "deliberate indifference" to inmate health or safety only
if he knows that inmates face a substantial risk of serious harm and
disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate
it. Pp. 832-851.

(a) Prison officials have a duty under the Eighth Amendment to
provide humane conditions of confinement. They must ensure that inmates receive adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical care, and
must protect prisoners from violence at the hands of other prisoners.
However, a constitutional violation occurs only where the deprivation
alleged is, objectively, "sufficiently serious," Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U. S.

511us3$64Z 11-04-97 20:54:26 PAGES OPINPGT
826 FARMER v. BRENNAN

Syllabus
294, 298, and the official has acted with "deliberate indifference" to
inmate health or safety. Pp. 832-834.

(b) Deliberate indifference entails something more than negligence,
but is satisfied by something less than acts or omissions for the very
purpose of causing harm or with knowledge that harm will result.
Thus, it is the equivalent of acting recklessly. However, this does not
establish the level of culpability deliberate indifference entails, for the
term recklessness is not self-defining, and can take subjective or objective forms. Pp. 835-837.

(c) Subjective recklessness, as used in the criminal law, is the appropriate test for "deliberate indifference." Permitting a finding of
recklessness only when a person has disregarded a risk of harm of which
he was aware is a familiar and workable standard that is consistent with
the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause as interpreted in this
Court's cases. The Eighth Amendment outlaws cruel and unusual
"punishments," not "conditions," and the failure to alleviate a significant
risk that an official should have perceived but did not, while no cause
for commendation, cannot be condemned as the infliction of punishment
under the Court's cases. Petitioner's invitation to adopt a purely objective test for determining liability--whether the risk is known or should
have been known--is rejected. This Court's cases "mandate inquiry
into a prison official's state of mind," id., at 299, and it is no accident
that the Court has repeatedly said that the Eighth Amendment has a
"subjective component." Pp. 837-840.

(d) The subjective test does not permit liability to be premised on
obviousness or constructive notice. Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378,
distinguished. However, this does not mean that prison officials will be
free to ignore obvious dangers to inmates. Whether an official had the
requisite knowledge is a question of fact subject to demonstration in the
usual ways, and a factfinder may conclude that the official knew of a
substantial risk from the very fact that it was obvious. Nor may an
official escape liability by showing that he knew of the risk but did not
think that the complainant was especially likely to be assaulted by the
prisoner who committed the act. It does not matter whether the risk
came from a particular source or whether a prisoner faced the risk for
reasons personal to him or because all prisoners in his situation faced
the risk. But prison officials may not be held liable if they prove that
they were unaware of even an obvious risk or if they responded reasonably to a known risk, even if the harm ultimately was not averted.
Pp. 840-845.

(e) Use of a subjective test will not foreclose prospective injunctive
relief, nor require a prisoner to suffer physical injury before obtaining

prospective relief. The subjective test adopted today is consistent with
the principle that "[o]ne does not have to await the consummation of
threatened injury to obtain preventive relief." Pennsylvania v. West
Virginia, 262 U. S. 553. In a suit for prospective relief, the subjective
factor, deliberate indifference, "should be determined in light of the
prison authorities' current attitudes and conduct," Helling v. McKinney,
509 U. S. 25, 36: their attitudes and conduct at the time suit is brought
and persisting thereafter. In making the requisite showing of subjective culpability, the prisoner may rely on developments that postdate
the pleadings and pretrial motions, as prison officials may rely on such
developments to show that the prisoner is not entitled to an injunction.
A court that finds the Eighth Amendment's objective and subjective
requirements satisfied may grant appropriate injunctive relief, though
it should approach issuance of injunctions with the usual caution. A
court need not ignore a prisoner's failure to take advantage of adequate
prison procedures to resolve inmate grievances, and may compel a prisoner to pursue them. Pp. 845-847.

2. On remand, the District Court must reconsider its denial of petitioner's Rule 56(f) discovery motion and apply the Eighth Amendment
principles explained herein. The court may have erred in placing decisive weight on petitioner's failure to notify respondents of a danger, and
such error may have affected the court's ruling on the discovery motion,
so that additional evidence may be available to petitioner. Neither of
two of respondents' contentions--that some of the officials had no knowledge about the confinement conditions and thus were alleged to be liable
only for the transfer, and that there is no present threat that petitioner
will be placed in a penitentiary--is so clearly correct as to justify affirmance. Pp. 848-851.

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 97 (1976). This case requires us to define the term"deliberate indifference," as we do by requiring a showing

that the official was subjectively aware of the risk.

I
The dispute before us stems from a civil suit brought bypetitioner, Dee Farmer, alleging that respondents, federal

prison officials, violated the Eighth Amendment by their de-liberate indifference to petitioner's safety. Petitioner, who
is serving a federal sentence for credit card fraud, has beendiagnosed by medical personnel of the Bureau of Prisons as
a transsexual, one who has "[a] rare psychiatric disorder inwhich a person feels persistently uncomfortable about his or
her anatomical sex," and who typically seeks medical treat-ment, including hormonal therapy and surgery, to bring
about a permanent sex change. American Medical Associa-tion, Encyclopedia of Medicine 1006 (1989); see also American
Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ofMental Disorders 74-75 (3d rev. ed. 1987). For several
years before being convicted and sentenced in 1986 at theage of 18, petitioner, who is biologically male, wore women's
clothing (as petitioner did at the 1986 trial), underwent es-trogen therapy, received silicone breast implants, and submitted to unsuccessful "black market" testicle-removal sur-gery. See Farmer v. Haas, 990 F. 2d 319, 320 (CA7 1993).
Petitioner's precise appearance in prison is unclear from therecord before us, but petitioner claims to have continued hormonal treatment while incarcerated by using drugs smug-gled into prison, and apparently wears clothing in a feminine
manner, as by displaying a shirt "off one shoulder," App.112. The parties agree that petitioner "projects feminine
characteristics." Id., at 51, 74.The practice of federal prison authorities is to incarcerate
preoperative transsexuals with prisoners of like biologicalsex, see

Farmer v. Haas, supra, at 320, and over time author-ities housed petitioner in several federal facilities, sometimes

Opinion of the Court
in the general male prison population but more often in seg-regation. While there is no dispute that petitioner was segregated at least several times because of violations of prisonrules, neither is it disputed that in at least one penitentiary
petitioner was segregated because of safety concerns. See
Farmer v. Carlson, 685 F. Supp. 1335, 1342 (MD Pa. 1988).On March 9, 1989, petitioner was transferred for disciplinary reasons from the Federal Correctional Institute in Ox-ford, Wisconsin (FCI-Oxford), to the United States Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana (USP-Terre Haute). Thoughthe record before us is unclear about the security designations of the two prisons in 1989, penitentiaries are typically
higher security facilities that house more troublesome prisoners than federal correctional institutes. See generally
Federal Bureau of Prisons, Facilities 1990. After an initial
stay in administrative segregation, petitioner was placed in
the USP-Terre Haute general population. Petitioner voiced
no objection to any prison official about the transfer to the
penitentiary or to placement in its general population.
Within two weeks, according to petitioner's allegations, petitioner was beaten and raped by another inmate in petitioner's cell. Several days later, after petitioner claims to have
reported the incident, officials returned petitioner to segregation to await, according to respondents, a hearing about
petitioner's HIV-positive status.

Acting without counsel, petitioner then filed a Bivens complaint, alleging a violation of the Eighth Amendment. See
Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388
(1971); Carlson v. Green, 446 U. S. 14 (1980). As defendants,
petitioner named respondents: the warden of USP-Terre
Haute and the Director of the Bureau of Prisons (sued only
in their official capacities); the warden of FCI-Oxford and a
case manager there; and the Director of the Bureau of Prisons North Central Region Office and an official in that office
(sued in their official and personal capacities). As later
amended, the complaint alleged that respondents either

Opinion of the Court
transferred petitioner to USP-Terre Haute or placed peti-tioner in its general population despite knowledge that the

penitentiary had a violent environment and a history of in-mate assaults, and despite knowledge that petitioner, as a
transsexual who "projects feminine characteristics," wouldbe particularly vulnerable to sexual attack by some USPTerre Haute inmates. This allegedly amounted to a deliber-ately indifferent failure to protect petitioner's safety, and
thus to a violation of petitioner's Eighth Amendment rights.Petitioner sought compensatory and punitive damages, and
an injunction barring future confinement in any penitentiary,including USP-Terre Haute.

Respondents filed a motion for summary judgment sup-ported by several affidavits, to which petitioner responded

with an opposing affidavit and a cross-motion for summaryjudgment; petitioner also invoked Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f), asking the court to delay its ruling until re-spondents had complied with petitioner's pending request for
production of documents. Respondents then moved for aprotective order staying discovery until resolution of the
issue of qualified immunity, raised in respondents' summaryjudgment motion.

Without ruling on respondents' request to stay discovery,the District Court denied petitioner's Rule 56(f) motion and
granted summary judgment to respondents, concluding thatthere had been no deliberate indifference to petitioner's
safety. The failure of prison officials to prevent inmate as-saults violates the Eighth Amendment, the court stated, only
if prison officials were "reckless in a criminal sense," mean-ing that they had "actual knowledge" of a potential danger. App. 124. Respondents, however, lacked the requisite

place petitioner in a "co-correctional facility" (i. e., one separately housing
male and female prisoners but allowing coeducational programming). Petitioner tells us, however, that the Bureau no longer operates such facilities,
and petitioner apparently no longer seeks this relief.

knowledge, the court found. "[Petitioner] never expressedany concern for his safety to any of [respondents]. Since

[respondents] had no knowledge of any potential danger to[petitioner], they were not deliberately indifferent to his
safety." Ibid.The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit summarily affirmed without opinion. We grantedcertiorari, 510 U. S. 811 (1993), because Courts of Appeals
had adopted inconsistent tests for "deliberate indifference."Compare, for example,

McGill v. Duckworth, 944 F. 2d 344,348 (CA7 1991) (holding that "deliberate indifference" requires a "subjective standard of recklessness"), cert. denied,503 U. S. 907 (1992), with

Young v. Quinlan, 960 F. 2d 351,360-361 (CA3 1992) ("[A] prison official is deliberately indifferent when he knows or should have known of a sufficientlyserious danger to an inmate").

The Constitution "does not mandate comfortable prisons,"
Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U. S. 337, 349 (1981), but neitherdoes it permit inhumane ones, and it is now settled that "the

treatment a prisoner receives in prison and the conditionsunder which he is confined are subject to scrutiny under the
Eighth Amendment," Helling, 509 U. S., at 31. In its pro-hibition of "cruel and unusual punishments," the Eighth
Amendment places restraints on prison officials, who maynot, for example, use excessive physical force against prisoners. See Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S. 1 (1992). TheAmendment also imposes duties on these officials, who must
provide humane conditions of confinement; prison officialsmust ensure that inmates receive adequate food, clothing,
shelter, and medical care, and must "take reasonable meas-ures to guarantee the safety of the inmates," Hudson v.
Palmer, 468 U. S. 517, 526-527 (1984). See Helling, supra,

Hudson v. Palmer, supra, at 526, having stripped them of

free to let the state of nature take its course. Cf. DeShaney,
supra, at 199-200; Estelle, supra, at 103-104. Prison conditions may be "restrictive and even harsh," Rhodes, supra,
at 347, but gratuitously allowing the beating or rape of one

Opinion of the Court
supra, at 102 (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958)
(plurality opinion)). Being violently assaulted in prison is
simply not "part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay
for their offenses against society." Rhodes, supra, at 347.

It is not, however, every injury suffered by one prisoner
at the hands of another that translates into constitutional
liability for prison officials responsible for the victim's safety.
Our cases have held that a prison official violates the Eighth
Amendment only when two requirements are met. First,
the deprivation alleged must be, objectively, "sufficiently serious," Wilson, supra, at 298; see also Hudson v. McMillian,
supra, at 5; a prison official's act or omission must result in
the denial of "the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities," Rhodes, supra, at 347. For a claim (like the one here)
based on a failure to prevent harm, the inmate must show
that he is incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial
risk of serious harm. See Helling, supra, at 35.3

The second requirement follows from the principle that
"only the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain implicates the Eighth Amendment." Wilson, 501 U. S., at 297
(internal quotation marks, emphasis, and citations omitted).
To violate the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, a
prison official must have a "sufficiently culpable state of
mind." Ibid.; see also id., at 302-303; Hudson v. McMillian, supra, at 8. In prison-conditions cases that state of
mind is one of "deliberate indifference" to inmate health or
safety, Wilson, supra, at 302-303; see also Helling, supra, at
34-35; Hudson v. McMillian, supra, at 5; Estelle, supra, at
106, a standard the parties agree governs the claim in this
case. The parties disagree, however, on the proper test for
deliberate indifference, which we must therefore undertake
to define.

3 At what point a risk of inmate assault becomes sufficiently substantial
for Eighth Amendment purposes is a question this case does not present,
and we do not address it.

1

Although we have never paused to explain the meaning of
the term "deliberate indifference," the case law is instructive. The term first appeared in the United States Reports
in Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S., at 104, and its use there shows
that deliberate indifference describes a state of mind more
blameworthy than negligence. In considering the inmate's
claim in Estelle that inadequate prison medical care violated
the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, we distinguished "deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of
prisoners," ibid., from "negligen[ce] in diagnosing or treating
a medical condition," id., at 106, holding that only the former
violates the Clause. We have since read Estelle for the
proposition that Eighth Amendment liability requires "more
than ordinary lack of due care for the prisoner's interests or
safety." Whitley v. Albers, 475 U. S. 312, 319 (1986).

While Estelle establishes that deliberate indifference entails something more than mere negligence, the cases are
also clear that it is satisfied by something less than acts or
omissions for the very purpose of causing harm or with
knowledge that harm will result. That point underlies the
ruling that "application of the deliberate indifference standard is inappropriate" in one class of prison cases: when "officials stand accused of using excessive physical force." Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S., at 6-7; see also Whitley, supra,
at 320. In such situations, where the decisions of prison officials are typically made " `in haste, under pressure, and frequently without the luxury of a second chance,' " Hudson v.
McMillian, supra, at 6 (quoting Whitley, supra, at 320), an
Eighth Amendment claimant must show more than "indifference," deliberate or otherwise. The claimant must show
that officials applied force "maliciously and sadistically for
the very purpose of causing harm," 503 U. S., at 6 (internal
quotation marks and citations omitted), or, as the Court also

511us3$64M 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT
836 FARMER v. BRENNAN

Opinion of the Court
put it, that officials used force with "a knowing willingnessthat [harm] occur," id., at 7 (internal quotation marks and

citation omitted). This standard of purposeful or knowingconduct is not, however, necessary to satisfy the mens rea
requirement of deliberate indifference for claims challengingconditions of confinement; "the very high state of mind prescribed by Whitley does not apply to prison conditionscases."

Wilson, supra, at 302-303.With deliberate indifference lying somewhere between the

poles of negligence at one end and purpose or knowledgeat the other, the Courts of Appeals have routinely equated
deliberate indifference with recklessness.4 See, e. g., LaMarca v. Turner, 995 F. 2d 1526, 1535 (CA11 1993); Manarite
v. Springfield, 957 F. 2d 953, 957 (CA1 1992); Redman v.
County of San Diego, 942 F. 2d 1435, 1443 (CA9 1991); McGill v. Duckworth, 944 F. 2d, at 347; Miltier v. Beorn, 896
F. 2d 848, 851-852 (CA4 1990); Martin v. White, 742 F. 2d469, 474 (CA8 1984); see also

Springfield v. Kibbe, 480 U. S.
257, 269 (1987) (O'Connor, J., dissenting). It is, indeed, fairto say that acting or failing to act with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to a prisoner is theequivalent of recklessly disregarding that risk.

That does not, however, fully answer the pending questionabout the level of culpability deliberate indifference entails,
for the term recklessness is not self-defining. The civil law
generally calls a person reckless who acts or (if the personhas a duty to act) fails to act in the face of an unjustifiably

high risk of harm that is either known or so obvious that itshould be known. See Prosser and Keeton $ 34, pp. 213-214;
Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 500 (1965). The criminal

4 Between the poles lies "gross negligence" too, but the term is a "nebulous" one, in practice typically meaning little different from recklessness
as generally understood in the civil law (which we discuss later in the
text). See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and
Keeton on Law of Torts $ 34, p. 212 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser
and Keeton).

Opinion of the Court
law, however, generally permits a finding of recklessness
only when a person disregards a risk of harm of which he is
aware. See R. Perkins & R. Boyce, Criminal Law 850-851
(3d ed. 1982); J. Hall, General Principles of Criminal Law
115-116, 120, 128 (2d ed. 1960) (hereinafter Hall); American
Law Institute, Model Penal Code $ 2.02(2)(c), and Comment
3 (1985); but see Commonwealth v. Pierce, 138 Mass. 165,
175-178 (1884) (Holmes, J.) (adopting an objective approach
to criminal recklessness). The standards proposed by the
parties in this case track the two approaches (though the
parties do not put it that way): petitioner asks us to define
deliberate indifference as what we have called civil-law recklessness,5 and respondents urge us to adopt an approach consistent with recklessness in the criminal law.6

We reject petitioner's invitation to adopt an objective test
for deliberate indifference. We hold instead that a prison
official cannot be found liable under the Eighth Amendment
for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to
inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of
facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw
the inference. This approach comports best with the text of
the Amendment as our cases have interpreted it. The
Eighth Amendment does not outlaw cruel and unusual "conditions"; it outlaws cruel and unusual "punishments." An
act or omission unaccompanied by knowledge of a significant
risk of harm might well be something society wishes to dis5 See Reply Brief for Petitioner 5 (suggesting that a prison official is
deliberately indifferent if he "knew facts which rendered an unreasonable
risk obvious; under such circumstances, the defendant should have known
of the risk and will be charged with such knowledge as a matter of law");
see also Brief for Petitioner 20-21.

6 See Brief for Respondents 16 (asserting that deliberate indifference

requires that a prison "official must know of the risk of harm to which an
inmate is exposed").

Opinion of the Court
courage, and if harm does result society might well wish toassure compensation. The common law reflects such concerns when it imposes tort liability on a purely objectivebasis. See Prosser and Keeton $$ 2, 34, pp. 6, 213-214; see
also Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U. S. C. $$ 2671-2680;
United States v. Muniz, 374 U. S. 150 (1963). But an offi-cial's failure to alleviate a significant risk that he should have

perceived but did not, while no cause for commendation, can-not under our cases be condemned as the infliction of
punishment.In

Wilson v. Seiter, we rejected a reading of the Eighth
Amendment that would allow liability to be imposed on
prison officials solely because of the presence of objectively
inhumane prison conditions. See 501 U. S., at 299-302. As
we explained there, our "cases mandate inquiry into a prison
official's state of mind when it is claimed that the official has
inflicted cruel and unusual punishment." Id., at 299. Although "state of mind," like "intent," is an ambiguous term
that can encompass objectively defined levels of blameworthiness, see 1 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal
Law $$ 3.4, 3.5, pp. 296-300, 313-314 (1986) (hereinafter LaFave & Scott); United States v. Bailey, 444 U. S. 394, 404
(1980), it was no accident that we said in Wilson and repeated in later cases that Eighth Amendment suits against
prison officials must satisfy a "subjective" requirement. See
Wilson, supra, at 298; see also Helling, 509 U. S., at 35;
Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S., at 8. It is true, as petitioner points out, that Wilson cited with approval Court of
Appeals decisions applying an objective test for deliberate
indifference to claims based on prison officials' failure to prevent inmate assaults. See 501 U. S., at 303 (citing CortesQuinones v. Jimenez-Nettleship, 842 F. 2d, at 560; and Morgan v. District of Columbia, 824 F. 2d 1049, 1057-1058
(CADC 1987)). But Wilson cited those cases for the proposition that the deliberate indifference standard applies to all
prison-conditions claims, not to undo its holding that the

839Cite as: 511 U. S. 825 (1994)
Opinion of the Court
Eighth Amendment has a "subjective component." 501U. S., at 298. Petitioner's purely objective test for deliberate indifference is simply incompatible with Wilson's holding.To be sure, the reasons for focusing on what a defendant's
mental attitude actually was (or is), rather than what itshould have been (or should be), differ in the Eighth Amendment context from that of the criminal law. Here, a subjec-tive approach isolates those who inflict punishment; there, it
isolates those against whom punishment should be inflicted.But the result is the same: to act recklessly in either setting
a person must "consciously disregar[d]" a substantial risk ofserious harm. Model Penal Code $ 2.02(2)(c).

At oral argument, the Deputy Solicitor General advisedagainst frank adoption of a criminal-law mens rea requirement, contending that it could encourage triers of fact to findEighth Amendment liability only if they concluded that prison
officials acted like criminals. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 39-40. We think this concern is misdirected. Bivens actions
against federal prison officials (and their 42 U. S. C. $ 1983counterparts against state officials) are civil in character, and
a court should no more allude to the criminal law when en-forcing the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause than
when applying the Free Speech and Press Clauses, wherewe have also adopted a subjective approach to recklessness.
See Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc. v. Connaughton,491 U. S. 657, 688 (1989) (holding that the standard for "reckless disregard" for the truth in a defamation action by a pub-lic figure "is a subjective one," requiring that "the defendant
in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publi-cation," or that "the defendant actually had a high degree of
awareness of . . . probable falsity") (internal quotation marksand citations omitted).

7 That said, subjective recklessness

as used in the criminal law is a familiar and workable stand7 Appropriate allusions to the criminal law would, of course, be proper
during criminal prosecutions under, for example, 18 U. S. C. $ 242, which
sets criminal penalties for deprivations of rights under color of law.

Opinion of the Court
ard that is consistent with the Cruel and Unusual Punish-ments Clause as interpreted in our cases, and we adopt it

as the test for "deliberate indifference" under the EighthAmendment.

2
Our decision that Eighth Amendment liability requiresconsciousness of a risk is thus based on the Constitution and

our cases, not merely on a parsing of the phrase "deliberateindifference." And we do not reject petitioner's arguments
for a thoroughly objective approach to deliberate indiffer-ence without recognizing that on the crucial point (whether
a prison official must know of a risk, or whether it sufficesthat he should know) the term does not speak with certainty.
Use of "deliberate," for example, arguably requires nothingmore than an act (or omission) of indifference to a serious
risk that is voluntary, not accidental. Cf. Estelle, 429 U. S.,at 105 (distinguishing "deliberate indifference" from "accident" or "inadverten[ce]"). And even if "deliberate" is bet-ter read as implying knowledge of a risk, the concept of
constructive knowledge is familiar enough that the term "de-liberate indifference" would not, of its own force, preclude a
scheme that conclusively presumed awareness from a risk'sobviousness.

Because "deliberate indifference" is a judicial gloss, ap-pearing neither in the Constitution nor in a statute, we could
not accept petitioner's argument that the test for "deliberateindifference" described in

Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378
(1989), must necessarily govern here. In Canton, interpret-ing Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, we held that a municipality can be liable for failure to train its employees when
the municipality's failure shows "a deliberate indifference tothe rights of its inhabitants." 489 U. S., at 389 (internal

quotation marks omitted). In speaking to the meaning ofthe term, we said that "it may happen that in light of the
duties assigned to specific officers or employees the need for

more or different training is so obvious, and the inadequacy
so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights,
that the policymakers of the city can reasonably be said to
have been deliberately indifferent to the need." Id., at 390;
see also id., at 390, n. 10 (elaborating). Justice O'Connor's
separate opinion for three Justices agreed with the Court's
"obvious[ness]" test and observed that liability is appropriate
when policymakers are "on actual or constructive notice" of
the need to train, id., at 396 (opinion concurring in part and
dissenting in part). It would be hard to describe the Canton understanding of deliberate indifference, permitting liability to be premised on obviousness or constructive notice,
as anything but objective.

Canton's objective standard, however, is not an appropriate test for determining the liability of prison officials
under the Eighth Amendment as interpreted in our cases.
Section 1983, which merely provides a cause of action, "contains no state-of-mind requirement independent of that necessary to state a violation of the underlying constitutional
right." Daniels v. Williams, 474 U. S. 327, 330 (1986). And
while deliberate indifference serves under the Eighth
Amendment to ensure that only inflictions of punishment
carry liability, see Wilson, 501 U. S., at 299-300, the "term
was used in the Canton case for the quite different purpose
of identifying the threshold for holding a city responsible for
the constitutional torts committed by its inadequately
trained agents," Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 124
(1992), a purpose the Canton Court found satisfied by a test
permitting liability when a municipality disregards "obvious" needs. Needless to say, moreover, considerable conceptual difficulty would attend any search for the subjective
state of mind of a governmental entity, as distinct from that
of a governmental official. For these reasons, we cannot accept petitioner's argument that Canton compels the conclu511us3$64M 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT
842 FARMER v. BRENNAN

Opinion of the Court
sion here that a prison official who was unaware of a substan-tial risk of harm to an inmate may nevertheless be held liable

under the Eighth Amendment if the risk was obvious and areasonable prison official would have noticed it.

We are no more persuaded by petitioner's argument that,
without an objective test for deliberate indifference, prisonofficials will be free to ignore obvious dangers to inmates.

Under the test we adopt today, an Eighth Amendment claim-ant need not show that a prison official acted or failed to act
believing that harm actually would befall an inmate; it isenough that the official acted or failed to act despite his
knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm. Cf. 1 C.
Torcia, Wharton's Criminal Law $ 27, p. 141 (14th ed. 1978);
Hall 115. We doubt that a subjective approach will present
prison officials with any serious motivation "to take refuge
in the zone between `ignorance of obvious risks' and `actual
knowledge of risks.' " Brief for Petitioner 27. Whether a
prison official had the requisite knowledge of a substantial
risk is a question of fact subject to demonstration in the
usual ways, including inference from circumstantial evidence,
cf. Hall 118 (cautioning against "confusing a mental state
with the proof of its existence"), and a factfinder may conclude that a prison official knew of a substantial risk from
the very fact that the risk was obvious. Cf. LaFave & Scott

$ 3.7, p. 335 ("[I]f the risk is obvious, so that a reasonable
man would realize it, we might well infer that [the defendant]
did in fact realize it; but the inference cannot be conclusive,
for we know that people are not always conscious of what
reasonable people would be conscious of "). For example, if
an Eighth Amendment plaintiff presents evidence showing
that a substantial risk of inmate attacks was "longstanding,
pervasive, well-documented, or expressly noted by prison
officials in the past, and the circumstances suggest that the
defendant-official being sued had been exposed to information concerning the risk and thus `must have known' about
it, then such evidence could be sufficient to permit a trier of

Nor may a prison official escape liability for deliberate in-difference by showing that, while he was aware of an obvious, substantial risk to inmate safety, he did not know thatthe complainant was especially likely to be assaulted by the
specific prisoner who eventually committed the assault.The question under the Eighth Amendment is whether
prison officials, acting with deliberate indifference, exposeda prisoner to a sufficiently substantial "risk of serious damage to his future health," Helling, 509 U. S., at 35, and it doesnot matter whether the risk comes from a single source or
multiple sources, any more than it matters whether a pris-oner faces an excessive risk of attack for reasons personal to
him or because all prisoners in his situation face such a risk.See Brief for Respondents 15 (stating that a prisoner can
establish exposure to a sufficiently serious risk of harm "byshowing that he belongs to an identifiable group of prisoners
who are frequently singled out for violent attack by otherinmates"). If, for example, prison officials were aware that
inmate "rape was so common and uncontrolled that some po-tential victims dared not sleep [but] instead . . . would leave

8 While the obviousness of a risk is not conclusive and a prison official
may show that the obvious escaped him, see infra, at 844, he would not
escape liability if the evidence showed that he merely refused to verify
underlying facts that he strongly suspected to be true, or declined to confirm inferences of risk that he strongly suspected to exist (as when a
prison official is aware of a high probability of facts indicating that one
prisoner has planned an attack on another but resists opportunities to
obtain final confirmation; or when a prison official knows that some diseases are communicable and that a single needle is being used to administer flu shots to prisoners but refuses to listen to a subordinate who he
strongly suspects will attempt to explain the associated risk of transmitting disease). When instructing juries in deliberate indifference cases
with such issues of proof, courts should be careful to ensure that the requirement of subjective culpability is not lost. It is not enough merely to
find that a reasonable person would have known, or that the defendant
should have known, and juries should be instructed accordingly.

their beds and spend the night clinging to the bars nearestthe guards' station,"

Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678, 681-682,
n. 3 (1978), it would obviously be irrelevant to liability thatthe officials could not guess beforehand precisely who would

attack whom. Cf. Helling, supra, at 33 (observing that the
Eighth Amendment requires a remedy for exposure of in-mates to "infectious maladies" such as hepatitis and venereal

disease "even though the possible infection might not affectall of those exposed");

Commonwealth v. Welansky, 316
Mass. 383, 55 N. E. 2d 902 (1944) (affirming conviction formanslaughter under a law requiring reckless or wanton conduct of a nightclub owner who failed to protect patrons from
a fire, even though the owner did not know in advance who
would light the match that ignited the fire or which patrons
would lose their lives); State v. Julius, 185 W. Va. 422, 431-
432, 408 S. E. 2d 1, 10-11 (1991) (holding that a defendant
may be held criminally liable for injury to an unanticipated
victim).

Because, however, prison officials who lacked knowledge
of a risk cannot be said to have inflicted punishment, it remains open to the officials to prove that they were unaware
even of an obvious risk to inmate health or safety. That a
trier of fact may infer knowledge from the obvious, in other
words, does not mean that it must do so. Prison officials
charged with deliberate indifference might show, for example, that they did not know of the underlying facts indicating
a sufficiently substantial danger and that they were therefore unaware of a danger, or that they knew the underlying
facts but believed (albeit unsoundly) that the risk to which
the facts gave rise was insubstantial or nonexistent.

In addition, prison officials who actually knew of a substantial risk to inmate health or safety may be found free from
liability if they responded reasonably to the risk, even if the
harm ultimately was not averted. A prison official's duty
under the Eighth Amendment is to ensure " `reasonable
safety,' " Helling, supra, at 33; see also Washington v. Har511US3 Unit: $U64 [11-04-99 07:50:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Spain v. Procunier, 600
F. 2d 189, 193 (CA9 1979) (Kennedy, J.); see also Bell v.
Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 547-548, 562 (1979). Whether oneputs it in terms of duty or deliberate indifference, prison

officials who act reasonably cannot be found liable under theCruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.

We address, finally, petitioner's argument that a subjectivedeliberate indifference test will unjustly require prisoners to
suffer physical injury before obtaining court-ordered correction of objectively inhumane prison conditions. "It would,"
indeed, "be odd to deny an injunction to inmates who plainly
proved an unsafe, life-threatening condition in their prison
on the ground that nothing yet had happened to them." Helling, supra, at 33. But nothing in the test we adopt today
clashes with that common sense. Petitioner's argument is
flawed for the simple reason that "[o]ne does not have to
await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief." Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S.
553, 593 (1923). Consistently with this principle, a subjective approach to deliberate indifference does not require a
prisoner seeking "a remedy for unsafe conditions [to] await
a tragic event [such as an] actua[l] assaul[t] before obtaining
relief." Helling, supra, at 33-34.

In a suit such as petitioner's, insofar as it seeks injunctive
relief to prevent a substantial risk of serious injury from
ripening into actual harm, "the subjective factor, deliberate
indifference, should be determined in light of the prison authorities' current attitudes and conduct," Helling, supra, at
36: their attitudes and conduct at the time suit is brought
and persisting thereafter. An inmate seeking an injunction
on the ground that there is "a contemporary violation of a
nature likely to continue," United States v. Oregon State
Medical Soc., 343 U. S. 326, 333 (1952), must adequately

Opinion of the Court
plead such a violation; to survive summary judgment, he
must come forward with evidence from which it can be inferred that the defendant-officials were at the time suit was
filed, and are at the time of summary judgment, knowingly
and unreasonably disregarding an objectively intolerable
risk of harm, and that they will continue to do so; and finally
to establish eligibility for an injunction, the inmate must
demonstrate the continuance of that disregard during the remainder of the litigation and into the future. In so doing,
the inmate may rely, in the district court's discretion, on developments that postdate the pleadings and pretrial motions,
as the defendants may rely on such developments to establish that the inmate is not entitled to an injunction.9 See
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(d); 6A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M.
Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure $$ 1504-1510, pp. 177-
211 (2d ed. 1990). If the court finds the Eighth Amendment's subjective and objective requirements satisfied, it
may grant appropriate injunctive relief. See Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S., at 685-688, and n. 9 (upholding order designed
to halt "an ongoing violation" in prison conditions that included extreme overcrowding, rampant violence, insufficient
food, and unsanitary conditions). Of course, a district court
should approach issuance of injunctive orders with the usual

9 If, for example, the evidence before a district court establishes that an
inmate faces an objectively intolerable risk of serious injury, the defendants could not plausibly persist in claiming lack of awareness, any more
than prison officials who state during the litigation that they will not take
reasonable measures to abate an intolerable risk of which they are aware
could claim to be subjectively blameless for purposes of the Eighth
Amendment, and in deciding whether an inmate has established a continuing constitutional violation a district court may take such developments
into account. At the same time, even prison officials who had a subjectively culpable state of mind when the lawsuit was filed could prevent
issuance of an injunction by proving, during the litigation, that they were
no longer unreasonably disregarding an objectively intolerable risk of
harm and that they would not revert to their obduracy upon cessation of
the litigation.

Opinion of the Court
caution, see Bell v. Wolfish, supra, at 562 (warning courts
against becoming "enmeshed in the minutiae of prison operations"), and may, for example, exercise its discretion if appropriate by giving prison officials time to rectify the situation
before issuing an injunction.

That prison officials' "current attitudes and conduct," Helling, 509 U. S., at 36, must be assessed in an action for injunctive relief does not mean, of course, that inmates are free to
bypass adequate internal prison procedures and bring their
health and safety concerns directly to court. "An appeal to
the equity jurisdiction conferred on federal district courts is
an appeal to the sound discretion which guides the determinations of courts of equity," Meredith v. Winter Haven, 320
U. S. 228, 235 (1943), and any litigant making such an appeal
must show that the intervention of equity is required.
When a prison inmate seeks injunctive relief, a court need
not ignore the inmate's failure to take advantage of adequate
prison procedures, and an inmate who needlessly bypasses
such procedures may properly be compelled to pursue them.
Cf. 42 U. S. C. $ 1997e (authorizing district courts in $ 1983
actions to require inmates to exhaust "such plain, speedy,
and effective administrative remedies as are available").
Even apart from the demands of equity, an inmate would be
well advised to take advantage of internal prison procedures
for resolving inmate grievances. When those procedures
produce results, they will typically do so faster than judicial
processes can. And even when they do not bring constitutionally required changes, the inmate's task in court will
obviously be much easier.

Accordingly, we reject petitioner's arguments and hold
that a prison official may be held liable under the Eighth
Amendment for denying humane conditions of confinement
only if he knows that inmates face a substantial risk of
serious harm and disregards that risk by failing to take
reasonable measures to abate it.

Opinion of the Court

III

A

Against this backdrop, we consider whether the District
Court's disposition of petitioner's complaint, summarily affirmed without briefing by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, comports with Eighth Amendment principles.
We conclude that the appropriate course is to remand.

In granting summary judgment to respondents on the
ground that petitioner had failed to satisfy the Eighth
Amendment's subjective requirement, the District Court
may have placed decisive weight on petitioner's failure to
notify respondents of a risk of harm. That petitioner "never
expressed any concern for his safety to any of [respondents],"
App. 124, was the only evidence the District Court cited for
its conclusion that there was no genuine dispute about respondents' assertion that they "had no knowledge of any
potential danger to [petitioner]," ibid. But with respect to
each of petitioner's claims, for damages and for injunctive
relief, the failure to give advance notice is not dispositive.
Petitioner may establish respondents' awareness by reliance
on any relevant evidence. See supra, at 842.

The summary judgment record does not so clearly establish respondents' entitlement to judgment as a matter of law
on the issue of subjective knowledge that we can simply assume the absence of error below. For example, in papers
filed in opposition to respondents' summary-judgment
motion, petitioner pointed to respondents' admission that
petitioner is a "non-violent" transsexual who, because of
petitioner's "youth and feminine appearance" is "likely to
experience a great deal of sexual pressure" in prison. App.
50-51, 73-74. And petitioner recounted a statement by one
of the respondents, then warden of the penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, who told petitioner that there was "a
high probability that [petitioner] could not safely function
at USP-Lewisburg," id., at 109, an incident confirmed in a

Opinion of the Court
published District Court opinion. See Farmer v. Carlson,685 F. Supp., at 1342; see also ibid. ("Clearly, placing plaintiff,

a twenty-one year old transsexual, into the general popula-tion at [USP-]Lewisburg, a [high-]security institution, could
pose a significant threat to internal security in general andto plaintiff in particular").

We cannot, moreover, be certain that additional evidenceis unavailable to petitioner because in denying petitioner's
Rule 56(f ) motion for additional discovery the District Courtmay have acted on a mistaken belief that petitioner's failure
to notify was dispositive. Petitioner asserted in papers accompanying the Rule 56(f) motion that the requested documents would show that "each defendant had knowledge thatUSP-Terre Haute was and is, a violent institution with a

history of sexual assault, stabbings, etc., [and that] each de-fendant showed reckless disregard for my safety by designating me to said institution knowing that I would be sexu-ally assaulted." App. 105-106. But in denying the Rule
56(f ) motion, the District Court stated that the requesteddocuments were "not shown by plaintiff to be necessary to
oppose defendants' motion for summary judgment," id., at
121, a statement consistent with the erroneous view that fail-ure to notify was fatal to petitioner's complaint.

Because the District Court may have mistakenly thoughtthat advance notification was a necessary element of an
Eighth Amendment failure-to-protect claim, we think itproper to remand for reconsideration of petitioner's Rule
56(f ) motion and, whether additional discovery is permittedor not, for application of the Eighth Amendment principles
explained above.10

10 The District Court's opinion is open to the reading that it required not
only advance notification of a substantial risk of assault, but also advance
notification of a substantial risk of assault posed by a particular fellow
prisoner. See App. 124 (referring to "a specific threat to [a prisoner's]
safety"). The Eighth Amendment, however, imposes no such requirement. See supra, at 842-844.

Opinion of the Court

B
Respondents urge us to affirm for reasons not relied onbelow, but neither of their contentions is so clearly correct

as to justify affirmance.With respect to petitioner's damages claim, respondents
argue that the officials sued in their individual capacities (of-ficials at FCI-Oxford and the Bureau of Prisons North Central Region office) were alleged to be liable only for theirtransfer of petitioner from FCI-Oxford to USP-Terre Haute,
whereas petitioner "nowhere alleges any reason for believingthat these officials, who had no direct responsibility for administering the Terre Haute institution, would have hadknowledge of conditions within that institution regarding
danger to transsexual inmates." Brief for Respondents 27-28. But petitioner's Rule 56(f ) motion alleged just that.
Though respondents suggest here that petitioner offered nofactual basis for that assertion, that is not a ground on which
they chose to oppose petitioner's Rule 56(f) motion belowand, in any event, is a matter for the exercise of the District
Court's judgment, not ours. Finally, to the extent respond-ents seek affirmance here on the ground that officials at
FCI-Oxford and the Bureau of Prisons regional office had nopower to control prisoner placement at Terre Haute, the record gives at least a suggestion to the contrary; the affidavitof one respondent, the warden of USP-Terre Haute, states
that after having been at USP-Terre Haute for about amonth petitioner was placed in administrative segregation
"pursuant to directive from the North Central Regional Of-fice" and a "request . . . by staff at FCI-Oxford." App. 94-
95. Accordingly, though we do not reject respondents' argu-ments about petitioner's claim for damages, the record does
not permit us to accept them as a basis for affirmance whenthey were not relied upon below. Respondents are free to
develop this line of argument on remand.With respect to petitioner's claim for injunctive relief, respondents argued in their merits brief that the claim was

"foreclosed by [petitioner's] assignment to administrative de-tention status because of his high-risk HIV-positive condition, . . . as well as by the absence of any allegation . . . thatadministrative detention status poses any continuing threat
of physical injury to him." Brief for Respondents 28-29.At oral argument, however, the Deputy Solicitor General informed us that petitioner was no longer in administrativedetention, having been placed in the general prison population of a medium-security prison. Tr. of Oral Arg. 25-26.He suggested that affirmance was nevertheless proper because "there is no present threat" that petitioner will beplaced in a setting where he would face a "continuing threat
of physical injury," id., at 26, but this argument turns onfacts about the likelihood of a transfer that the District
Court is far better placed to evaluate than we are. We leaveit to respondents to present this point on remand.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and thecase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with

this opinion.

So ordered.

Justice Blackmun, concurring.
I agree with Justice Stevens that inhumane prison con-ditions violate the Eighth Amendment even if no prison official has an improper, subjective state of mind. This Court'sholding in

Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U. S. 294 (1991), to the effectthat barbaric prison conditions may be beyond the reach of

the Eighth Amendment if no prison official can be deemedindividually culpable, in my view is insupportable in principle and is inconsistent with our precedents interpreting theCruel and Unusual Punishments Clause. Whether the Constitution has been violated "should turn on the character ofthe punishment rather than the motivation of the individual who inflicted it." Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 116

(1976) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Wilson v. Seiter shouldbe overruled.

Although I do not go along with the Court's reliance onWilson in defining the "deliberate indifference" standard, I
join the Court's opinion, because it creates no new obstaclesfor prison inmates to overcome, and it sends a clear message
to prison officials that their affirmative duty under the Con-stitution to provide for the safety of inmates is not to be
taken lightly. Under the Court's decision today, prison offi-cials may be held liable for failure to remedy a risk so obvious and substantial that the officials must have known aboutit, see

ante, at 842-843, and prisoners need not " `await atragic event [such as an] actua[l] assaul[t] before obtaining

relief,' " ante, at 845. I

Petitioner is a transsexual who is currently serving a 20-year sentence in an all-male federal prison for credit card
fraud. Although a biological male, petitioner has undergonetreatment for silicone breast implants and unsuccessful surgery to have his testicles removed. Despite his overtly fem-inine characteristics, and his previous segregation at a different federal prison because of safety concerns, see Farmer v.
Carlson, 685 F. Supp. 1335, 1342 (MD Pa. 1988), prison offi-cials at the United States Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, housed him in the general population of that maximum-security prison. Less than two weeks later, petitioner was
brutally beaten and raped by another inmate in petitioner'scell.

Homosexual rape or other violence among prison inmatesserves absolutely no penological purpose. See

Rhodes v.
Chapman, 452 U. S. 337, 345-346 (1981), citing Gregg v. Geor-gia, 428 U. S. 153, 183 (1976) ( joint opinion) (the Eighth

Amendment prohibits all punishment, physical and mental,which is "totally without penological justification"). "Such
brutality is the equivalent of torture, and is offensive to anymodern standard of human dignity." United States v. Bai511us3$64F 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT

ley, 444 U. S. 394, 423 (1980) (Blackmun, J., dissenting).The horrors experienced by many young inmates, particularly those who, like petitioner, are convicted of nonviolentoffenses, border on the unimaginable. Prison rape not only
threatens the lives of those who fall prey to their aggressors,
but is potentially devastating to the human spirit. Shame,depression, and a shattering loss of self-esteem accompany

the perpetual terror the victim thereafter must endure.See Note, Rape in Prison and AIDS: A Challenge for the
Eighth Amendment Framework of Wilson v. Seiter, 44 Stan.L. Rev. 1541, 1545 (1992). Unable to fend for himself without the protection of prison officials, the victim finds himselfat the mercy of larger, stronger, and ruthless inmates. Although formally sentenced to a term of incarceration, many
inmates discover that their punishment, even for nonviolentoffenses like credit card fraud or tax evasion, degenerates

into a reign of terror unmitigated by the protection supposedly afforded by prison officials.*

The fact that our prisons are badly overcrowded and understaffed may well explain many of the shortcomings of our
penal systems. But our Constitution sets minimal standards governing the administration of punishment in this
country, see Rhodes, 452 U. S., at 347, and thus it is no answer to the complaints of the brutalized inmate that the re*Numerous court opinions document the pervasive violence among inmates in our state and federal prisons. See, e. g., United States v. Bailey,

The Court in Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U. S. 294 (1991), held
that any pain and suffering endured by a prisoner that isnot formally a part of his sentence--no matter how severe

or unnecessary--will not be held violative of the Cruel andUnusual Punishments Clause unless the prisoner establishes
that some prison official intended the harm. The Court jus-tified this remarkable conclusion by asserting that only pain
that is intended by a state actor to be punishment is punish-ment. See

id., at 300 ("The source of the intent requirement
is not the predilections of this Court, but the Eighth Amendment itself, which bans only cruel and unusual punishment.If the pain inflicted is not formally meted out as

punishment
by the statute or the sentencing judge, some mental elementmust be attributed to the inflicting officer before it can qualify") (emphasis in original).

The Court's analysis is fundamentally misguided; indeed
it defies common sense. "Punishment" does not necessarily
imply a culpable state of mind on the part of an identifiable
punisher. A prisoner may experience punishment when he
suffers "severe, rough, or disastrous treatment," see, e. g.,
Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1843 (1961),

regardless of whether a state actor intended the cruel treat-ment to chastise or deter. See also Webster's New International Dictionary of the English Language 1736 (1923) (de-fining punishment as "[a]ny pain, suffering, or loss inflicted
on or suffered by a person because of a crime or evil-doing")
(emphasis added); cf. Wilson, 501 U. S., at 300, citing Duckworth v. Franzen, 780 F. 2d 645, 652 (CA7 1985) (" `The infliction of punishment is a deliberate act intended to chastiseor deter' "), cert. denied, 479 U. S. 816 (1986).

The Court's unduly narrow definition of punishment blindsit to the reality of prison life. Consider, for example, a situation in which one individual is sentenced to a period of confinement at a relatively safe, well-managed prison, complete
with tennis courts and cable television, while another is sentenced to a prison characterized by rampant violence and
terror. Under such circumstances, it is natural to say that
the latter individual was subjected to a more extreme punishment. It matters little that the sentencing judge did not
specify to which prison the individuals would be sent; nor
is it relevant that the prison officials did not intend either
individual to suffer any attack. The conditions of confinement, whatever the reason for them, resulted in differing
punishment for the two convicts.

Wilson's myopic focus on the intentions of prison officials
is also mistaken. Where a legislature refuses to fund a
prison adequately, the resulting barbaric conditions should
not be immune from constitutional scrutiny simply because
no prison official acted culpably. Wilson failed to recognize
that "state-sanctioned punishment consists not so much of
specific acts attributable to individual state officials, but
more of a cumulative agglomeration of action (and inaction)
on an institutional level." The Supreme Court--Leading
Cases, 105 Harv. L. Rev. 177, 243 (1991). The responsibility
for subminimal conditions in any prison inevitably is diffuse,
and often borne, at least in part, by the legislature. Yet,
regardless of what state actor or institution caused the harm

Blackmun, J., concurring
and with what intent, the experience of the inmate is thesame. A punishment is simply no less cruel or unusual because its harm is unintended. In view of this obvious fact,there is no reason to believe that, in adopting the Eighth
Amendment, the Framers intended to prohibit cruel and
unusual punishments only when they were inflicted inten-tionally. As Judge Noonan has observed:

"The Framers were familiar from their wartime experience of British prisons with the kind of cruel punish-ment administered by a warden with the mentality of a

Captain Bligh. But they were also familiar with the
cruelty that came from bureaucratic indifference to the
conditions of confinement. The Framers understood
that cruel and unusual punishment can be administeredby the failure of those in charge to give heed to the

impact of their actions on those within their care."
Jordan v. Gardner, 986 F. 2d 1521, 1544 (CA9 1993) (concurring opinion) (citations omitted) (emphasis added).

Before Wilson, it was assumed, if not established, that the
conditions of confinement are themselves part of the punish-ment, even if not specifically "meted out" by a statute or

judge. See Wilson, 501 U. S., 306-309 (White, J., concurringin judgment), citing

Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678 (1978);
Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U. S. 337 (1981). We examined
only the objective severity of the conditions of confinementin the preWilson cases, not the subjective intent of government officials, as we found that "[a]n express intent to inflictunnecessary pain is not required, . . . and

harsh `conditions
of confinement' may constitute cruel and unusual punishment unless such conditions `are part of the penalty that
criminal offenders pay for their offenses against society.' "
Whitley v. Albers, 475 U. S. 312, 319 (1986), quoting Rhodes,
452 U. S., at 347 (emphasis added). This initial approach,
which employed an objective standard to chart the boundaries of the Eighth Amendment, reflected the practical real511us3$64F 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT

ity that "intent simply is not very meaningful when consider-ing a challenge to an institution, such as a prison system,"

Wilson, 501 U. S., at 310 (White, J., concurring in judgment).It also, however, demonstrated a commitment to the principles underlying the Eighth Amendment. The Cruel andUnusual Punishments Clause was not adopted to protect
prison officials with arguably benign intentions from law-suits. The Eighth Amendment guarantees each prisoner
that reasonable measures will be taken to ensure his safety.Where a prisoner can prove that no such reasonable steps
were taken and, as a result, he experienced severe pain orsuffering without any penological justification, the Eighth
Amendment is violated regardless of whether there is aneasily identifiable wrongdoer with poor intentions.

II
Though I believe Wilson v. Seiter should be overruled, anddisagree with the Court's reliance upon that case in defining

the "deliberate indifference" standard, I nonetheless join theCourt's opinion. Petitioner never challenged this Court's
holding in Wilson or sought reconsideration of the theoryupon which that decision is based. More importantly, the
Court's opinion does not extend Wilson beyond its ill-conceived boundaries or erect any new obstacles for prison
inmates to overcome in seeking to remedy cruel and unusualconditions of confinement. The Court specifically recognizes
that "[h]aving incarcerated `persons [with] demonstrated pro-clivities for criminally antisocial and, in many cases, violent
conduct,' [and] having stripped them of virtually everymeans of self-protection and foreclosed their access to outside aid, the government and its officials are not free to letthe state of nature take its course." Ante, at 833. The
Court further acknowledges that prison rape is not consti-tutionally tolerable, see ante, at 834 ("Being violently assaulted in prison is simply not `part of the penalty that crimi-nal offenders pay for their offenses against society' "), and it

511us3$64F 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT
858 FARMER v. BRENNAN

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
clearly states that prisoners can obtain relief before beingvictimized, see

ante, at 845 ("[A] subjective approach to deliberate indifference does not require a prisoner seeking `aremedy for unsafe conditions [to] await a tragic event [such

as an] actua[l] assaul[t] before obtaining relief ' "). Finally,
under the Court's holding, prison officials may be held liablefor failure to remedy a risk of harm so obvious and substantial that the prison officials must have known about it, see
ante, at 842-843. The opinion's clear message is that prison
officials must fulfill their affirmative duty under the Consti-tution to prevent inmate assault, including prison rape, or

otherwise face a serious risk of being held liable for damages,see

ante, at 842-844, or being required by a court to rectify
the hazardous conditions, see ante, at 845-847. As much
as is possible within the constraints of Wilson v. Seiter,the Court seeks to ensure that the conditions in our Nation's prisons in fact comport with the "contemporary standard of decency" required by the Eighth Amendment. See
DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Servs., 489
U. S. 189, 198-200 (1989). Short of overruling Wilson v.
Seiter, the Court could do no better.

Justice Stevens, concurring.
While I continue to believe that a state official may inflict
cruel and unusual punishment without any improper subjective motivation, see Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 116-117
(1976) (dissenting opinion); Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U. S. 294,
306-307 (1991) (White, J., concurring in judgment), I join
Justice Souter's thoughtful opinion because it is faithful to
our precedents.

Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.
Prisons are necessarily dangerous places; they house society's most antisocial and violent people in close proximity
with one another. Regrettably, "[s]ome level of brutality
and sexual aggression among [prisoners] is inevitable no

matter what the guards do . . . unless all prisoners are lockedin their cells 24 hours a day and sedated."

McGill v. Duckworth, 944 F. 2d 344, 348 (CA7 1991). Today, in an attemptto rectify such unfortunate conditions, the Court further

refines the "National Code of Prison Regulation," otherwise known as the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.
Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S. 1, 28 (1992) (Thomas, J.,
dissenting).I adhere to my belief, expressed in

Hudson and Helling v.
McKinney, 509 U. S. 25 (1993) (Thomas, J., dissenting), that"judges or juries--but not jailers--impose `punishment.' "

Id., at 40. "[P]unishment," from the time of the Founding
through the present day, "has always meant a `fine, penalty,
or confinement inflicted upon a person by the authority of
the law and the judgment and sentence of a court, for some
crime or offense committed by him.' " Id., at 38 (quoting
Black's Law Dictionary 1234 (6th ed. 1990)). See also 2
T. Sheridan, A General Dictionary of the English Language
(1780) (defining "punishment" as "[a]ny infliction imposed in
vengeance of a crime"). Conditions of confinement are not
punishment in any recognized sense of the term, unless imposed as part of a sentence. See Helling, supra, at 42
(Thomas, J., dissenting). As an original matter, therefore,
this case would be an easy one for me: Because the unfortunate attack that befell petitioner was not part of his sentence, it did not constitute "punishment" under the Eighth
Amendment.

When approaching this case, however, we do not write on
a clean slate. Beginning with Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97
(1976), the Court's prison condition jurisprudence has been
guided, not by the text of the Constitution, but rather by
"evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of
a maturing society." Id., at 102 (internal quotation marks
omitted). See also ante, at 833-834; Helling, supra; Hudson, supra. I continue to doubt the legitimacy of that mode
of constitutional decisionmaking, the logical result of which,

511us3$64N 11-04-97 20:54:27 PAGES OPINPGT
860 FARMER v. BRENNAN

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
in this context, is to transform federal judges into superin-tendents of prison conditions nationwide. See

Helling,
supra, at 40-41 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Although Estelleloosed the Eighth Amendment from its historical moorings,

the Court is now unwilling to accept the full consequences
of its decision and therefore resorts to the "subjective" (stateof mind) component of postEstelle Eighth Amendment analysis in an attempt to contain what might otherwise be un-bounded liability for prison officials under the Cruel and

Unusual Punishments Clause. Cf. McGill, supra, at 348.Although I disagree with the constitutional predicate of
the Court's analysis, I share the Court's view that petitioner's theory of liability--that a prison official can be held
liable for risks to prisoner safety of which he was ignorant
but should have known--fails under even "a straightforward
application of Estelle." Helling, supra, at 42 (Thomas, J.,
dissenting). In adopting the "deliberate indifference" standard for challenges to prison conditions, Estelle held that
mere "inadverten[ce]" or "negligen[ce]" does not violate the
Eighth Amendment. 429 U. S., at 105-106. "From the outset, thus, we specified that the Eighth Amendment does not
apply to every deprivation, or even every unnecessary deprivation, suffered by a prisoner, but only that narrow class
of deprivations involving `serious' injury inflicted by prison
officials acting with a culpable state of mind." Hudson,
supra, at 20 (Thomas, J., dissenting). We reiterated this
understanding in Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U. S. 294, 305 (1991),
holding that "mere negligence" does not constitute deliberate
indifference under Estelle. See also, e. g., Whitley v. Albers,
475 U. S. 312, 319 (1986). Petitioner's suggested "should
have known" standard is nothing but a negligence standard,
as the Court's discussion implicitly assumes. Ante, at 837-
839. Thus, even under Estelle, petitioner's theory of liability necessarily fails.

The question remains, however, what state of mind is
sufficient to constitute deliberate indifference under Estelle.

861Cite as: 511 U. S. 825 (1994)
Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
Given my serious doubts concerning the correctness ofEstelle in extending the Eighth Amendment to cover challenges to conditions of confinement, I believe the scope of theEstelle "right" should be confined as narrowly as possible.
Cf. Helling, supra, at 42 (Thomas, J., dissenting). In Wilson, the Court has already held that the highest subjectivestandard known to our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence--

"maliciou[s] and sadisti[c]" action "for the very purpose ofcausing harm," Whitley, supra, at 320-321 (internal quotation marks omitted)--"does not apply to prison conditionscases." Wilson, supra, at 303. The Court today adopts the
next highest level of subjective intent, actual knowledge ofthe type sufficient to constitute recklessness in the criminal
law, ante, at 837, 839-840, noting that "due regard" is appro-priate "for prison officials' `unenviable task of keeping dangerous men in safe custody under humane conditions.' " 1Ante, at 845 (quoting Spain v. Procunier, 600 F. 2d 189, 193
(CA9 1979) (Kennedy, J.)).Even though the Court takes a step in the right direction
by adopting a restrictive definition of deliberate indifference,I cannot join the Court's opinion. For the reasons expressed
more fully in my dissenting opinions in Hudson and Helling,I remain unwilling to subscribe to the view, adopted by

ipsedixit in Estelle, that the Eighth Amendment regulates

prison conditions not imposed as part of a sentence. Indeed,"[w]ere the issue squarely presented, . . . I might vote to
overrule Estelle." Helling, 509 U. S., at 42 (Thomas, J., dis-senting). Nonetheless, the issue is not squarely presented

1 The facts of this case demonstrate how difficult that task can be.
When petitioner was taken out of general prison population for security
reasons at United States Penitentiary-Lewisburg, he asserted that he
"d[id] not need extra security precautions" and filed suit alleging that
placing him in solitary confinement was unconstitutional. See Farmer v.
Carlson, 685 F. Supp. 1335, 1342 (MD Pa. 1988). Petitioner's present
claim, oddly enough, is essentially that leaving him in general prison population was unconstitutional because it subjected him to a risk of sexual
assault.

in this case. Respondents have not asked us to revisitEstelle, and no one has briefed or argued the question. In

addition to these prudential concerns, stare decisis counselshesitation in overruling dubious precedents. See 509 U. S.,
at 42. For these reasons, I concur in the Court's judgment.2In doing so, however, I remain hopeful that in a proper case
the Court will reconsider Estelle in light of the constitutionaltext and history.

2 I do not read the remand portion of the Court's opinion to intimate
that the courts below reached the wrong result, especially because the
Seventh Circuit has long followed the rule of law the Court lays down
today. See McGill v. Duckworth, 944 F. 2d 344 (CA7 1991); Duckworth v.
Franzen, 780 F. 2d 645 (CA7 1985). Rather, I regard it as a cautionary
measure undertaken merely to give the Court of Appeals an opportunity
to decide in the first instance whether the District Court erroneously gave
dispositive weight to petitioner's failure to complain to prison officials that
he believed himself at risk of sexual assault in the general prison population. Ante, at 849. If, on remand, the Seventh Circuit concludes that the
District Court did not, nothing in the Court's opinion precludes the Seventh Circuit from summarily affirming the entry of summary judgment in
respondents' favor.

DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORP. v. DESKTOP DIRECT,INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 93-405. Argued February 22, 1994--Decided June 6, 1994
Pursuant to a settlement agreement between the parties, the District

Court dismissed a trademark infringement suit that respondent Desktop
Direct, Inc., had filed against petitioner Digital Equipment Corporation.
Months later, it granted Desktop's motion to vacate the dismissal and
rescind the agreement on the ground that Digital had misrepresented
material facts during settlement negotiations. The Court of Appeals
dismissed Digital's appeal for lack of jurisdiction, see 28 U. S. C. $ 1291,
holding that the District Court order was not immediately appealable
under the collateral order doctrine. Applying the three-pronged test
set forth in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541,
and Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, it concluded that the
entitlement claimed under the settlement agreement was insufficiently
"important" to warrant immediate appeal as of right and reasoned that
an alleged privately negotiated "right not to go to trial" was different in
kind from an immunity rooted in an explicit constitutional or statutory
provision or compelling public policy rationale, the denial of which has
been held to be immediately appealable.

Held: A refusal to enforce a settlement agreement claimed to shelter a

party from suit is not immediately appealable under $ 1291. Pp. 867-884.

(a) Although certain categories of prejudgment decisions justify departure from $ 1291's general final judgment requirement, the collateral
order doctrine is a narrow exception and should never be allowed to
swallow the rule. Thus, immediate appeal is confined to those decisions
that are conclusive, that resolve important questions completely separate from the merits, and that would render such questions effectively
unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action. See Coopers & Lybrand, supra. Appealability must be determined for the entire category to which a claim belongs, without regard
to the chance that the litigation at hand might be speeded, or a particular injustice averted, by a prompt appellate court decision. Pp. 867-868.

(b) Orders denying immunities are strong candidates for prompt appeal under $ 1291. Abney v. United States, 431 U. S. 651 (right to be
free from a second trial on a criminal charge); Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472
U. S. 511 (right of government official to qualified immunity from dam511us3$65z 11-04-97 20:57:27 PAGES OPINPGT

Syllabus
ages suit). However, merely identifying some interest that would be
"irretrievably lost" has never sufficed to meet the third Cohen requirement, see generally Lauro Lines s.r.l. v. Chasser, 490 U. S. 495, 499, for
then appellate jurisdiction would depend on a party's agility in characterizing the right asserted. Even limiting the focus to whether the
interest claimed may be called a "right not to stand trial" would move

$ 1291 aside too easily, since virtually any right that could be enforced
appropriately by pretrial dismissal might loosely be so described. Precisely because there is no single, obviously correct way to characterize
an asserted right, $ 1291 requires courts of appeals to view claims of a
"right not to be tried" with skepticism. Pp. 868-875.

(c) That Digital's agreement may be read as providing for immunity
from trial does not distinguish its claim from other arguable rights to
be trial free, such as an assertion of res judicata, and attaching significance to the supposed clarity of this agreement's terms would flout the
admonition that availability of collateral order appeal must be determined categorically. More fundamentally, such a right by agreement
does not rise to the level of importance needed for recognition under

$ 1291. Digital errs in maintaining that "importance" has no place in
a doctrine justified as supplying a gloss on Congress's "final decision"
language. The third Cohen question, whether a right is "adequately
vindicable" or "effectively reviewable," simply cannot be answered without a judgment about the value of the interests that would be lost
through rigorous application of a final judgment requirement. While
there is no need to decide here that a privately conferred right could
never supply the basis of a collateral order appeal, there are sound reasons for treating such rights differently from those originating in the
Constitution or statutes. There is little room to gainsay the importance
of the public policy embodied in constitutional or statutory provisions
entitling a party to immunity from suit, but including such a provision
in a private contract is barely a prima facie indication that the right is
important to the benefited party, let alone that its value exceeds that of
other rights not embodied in agreements, or that it is "important" in
Cohen's sense, as being weightier than the policies advanced by $ 1291.
Pp. 875-881.

(d) Even if the term "importance" were to be exorcised from the
Cohen analysis altogether, Digital's rights would remain adequately vindicable on final judgment to an extent that other immunities are not.
Freedom from trial is rarely the sine qua non of a negotiated settlement
agreement and will rarely compare with the embarrassment and anxiety
averted by a successful double jeopardy claimant or the distraction from
duty avoided by qualified immunity. Moreover, unlike trial immunity
claimants relying on public law, a settling party can seek relief in state

court for breach of contract or may move for a sanction under Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 11 if a rescission was sought for improper purposes. In addition, Digital's insistence that the District Court applied
a fundamentally wrong legal standard in vacating the dismissal order
here might support a discretionary interlocutory appeal under 28

Section 1291 of the Judicial Code confines appeals as ofright to those from "final decisions of the district courts."

See Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541,546 (1949). We hold that an order denying effect to a settlement agreement does not come within the narrow ambit ofcollateral orders.

866 DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORP. v. DESKTOP DIRECT, INC.

Opinion of the Court
United States District Court for the District of Utah, charg-ing Digital with unlawful use of the Desktop Direct name.

Desktop sent Digital a copy of the complaint, and negotia-tions between officers of the two corporations ensued.
Under a confidential settlement reached on March 25, 1992,
Digital agreed to pay Desktop a sum of money for the rightto use the "Desktop Direct" trade name and corresponding

trademark, and for waiver of all damages and dismissal ofthe suit. That same day, Desktop filed a notice of dismissal
in the District Court.Several months later, Desktop moved to vacate the dismissal and rescind the settlement agreement, alleging misrepresentation of material facts during settlement negotiations. The District Court granted the motion, concluding
"that a fact finder could determine that [Digital] failed to
disclose material facts to [Desktop] during settlement negotiations which would have resulted in rejection of the settlement offer." App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a. After the District
Court declined to reconsider that ruling or stay its order
vacating dismissal, Digital appealed.

The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit dismissed the
appeal for lack of jurisdiction, holding that the District Court
order was not appealable under $ 1291, because it neither
"end[ed] the litigation on the merits" nor "[fell] within the
long-recognized `collateral order' exception to the final judgment requirement." 993 F. 2d 755, 757 (1993). Applying
the three-pronged test for determining when "collateral
order" appeal is allowed, see Cohen, supra; Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463 (1978), the Court of Appeals
concluded that any benefits claimed under the settlement
agreement were insufficiently "important" to warrant the
immediate appeal as of right. Although Digital claimed
what it styled a "right not to go to trial," the court reasoned
that any such privately negotiated right as Digital sought to
vindicate was different in kind from an immunity rooted in
an explicit constitutional or statutory provision or "compel511us3$65M 11-04-97 20:57:27 PAGES OPINPGT

The Tenth Circuit recognized that it was thus deviatingfrom the rule followed in some other Courts of Appeals, see

Forbus v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 958 F. 2d 1036 (CA11 1992);
Grillet v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 927 F. 2d 217 (CA5 1991);Janneh v. GAF Corp., 887 F. 2d 432 (CA2 1989); but see

Transtech Industries, Inc. v. A & Z Septic Clean, 5 F. 3d 51(CA3 1993), cert. pending, No. 93-960. We granted certiorari, 510 U. S. 942 (1993), to resolve this conflict and nowaffirm.

A

The collateral order doctrine is best understood not as anexception to the "final decision" rule laid down by Congress

in $ 1291, but as a "practical construction" of it, Cohen, supra,at 546; see, e. g., Coopers & Lybrand, supra, at 468. We
have repeatedly held that the statute entitles a party to ap-peal not only from a district court decision that "ends the
litigation on the merits and leaves nothing more for the courtto do but execute the judgment,"

Catlin v. United States,324 U. S. 229, 233 (1945), but also from a narrow class of

decisions that do not terminate the litigation, but must, inthe interest of "achieving a healthy legal system," cf. Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U. S. 323, 326 (1940), nonethe-less be treated as "final." The latter category comprises
only those district court decisions that are conclusive, thatresolve important questions completely separate from the
merits, and that would render such important questionseffectively unreviewable on appeal from final judgment in
the underlying action. See generally Coopers & Lybrand,

generally Richardson-Merrell Inc. v. Koller, 472 U. S. 424(1985).

But we have also repeatedly stressed that the "narrow"exception should stay that way and never be allowed to swallow the general rule, id., at 436, that a party is entitled to asingle appeal, to be deferred until final judgment has been
entered, in which claims of district court error at any stageof the litigation may be ventilated, see

United States v. Hol-lywood Motor Car Co., 458 U. S. 263, 270 (1982). We have

accordingly described the conditions for collateral order ap-peal as stringent, see,

e. g., Midland Asphalt Corp. v. UnitedStates, 489 U. S. 794, 799 (1989), and have warned that the

issue of appealability under $ 1291 is to be determined forthe entire category to which a claim belongs, without regard
to the chance that the litigation at hand might be speeded,or a "particular injustic[e]" averted, Van Cauwenberghe v.
Biard, 486 U. S. 517, 529 (1988), by a prompt appellate courtdecision. See also

Richardson-Merrell, supra, at 439 (thisCourt "has expressly rejected efforts to reduce the finality

requirement of $ 1291 to a case-by-case [appealability] deter-mination"); Carroll v. United States, 354 U. S. 394, 405 (1957).

B
Here, the Court of Appeals accepted Digital's claim thatthe order vacating dismissal (and so rescinding the settlement agreement) was the "final word on the subject ad-dressed," 993 F. 2d, at 757 (citation omitted), and held the
second Cohen condition, separability, to be satisfied, as well.Neither conclusion is beyond question,

2 It might be argued that given the District Court's "somewhat cryptic"
reference, 993 F. 2d, at 757, to what "a trier of fact could determine," its
recision order here was merely "tentative," Coopers & Lybrand v.
Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 469, n. 11 (1978), and thus inadequate under the
first Cohen test, or that the basis for vacating, Digital's alleged misrepre511us3$65M 11-04-97 20:57:27 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
untouched here, both because Desktop has made no seriouseffort to defend the Court of Appeals' judgment on those

points and because the failure to meet the third condition ofthe Cohen test, that the decision on an "important" question
be "effectively unreviewable" upon final judgment, would initself suffice to foreclose immediate appeal under $ 1291.

3

Turning to these dispositive factors, we conclude, despiteDigital's position that it holds a "right not to stand trial"

requiring protection by way of immediate appeal, that rightsunder private settlement agreements can be adequately vindicated on appeal from final judgment.

C
The roots of Digital's argument that the settlement withDesktop gave it a "right not to stand trial altogether" (and

that such a right per se satisfies the third Cohen require-ment) are readily traced to Abney v. United States, 431 U. S.
651 (1977), where we held that $ 1291 entitles a criminal de-fendant to appeal an adverse ruling on a double jeopardy
claim, without waiting for the conclusion of his trial. Afterholding the second

Cohen requirement satisfied by the dis-tinction between the former jeopardy claim and the question

of guilt to be resolved at trial, we emphasized that the FifthAmendment not only secures the right to be free from multisentations about when it first learned of Desktop's use of the trade name,
was so "enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff's
cause of action," 437 U. S., at 469 (internal quotation marks omitted), i. e.,
whether Digital (willfully) misappropriated the name, as to elude Cohen's
second requirement for collateral order appeal. Indeed, it is possible that
the District Court phrased its order here in equivocal terms precisely
because it assumed that this lack of separability would preclude any immediate appeal under $ 1291.

3 We have of course held that the Cohen requirements go to an appellate

court's subject-matter jurisdiction, see Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v.
Risjord, 449 U. S. 368, 379 (1981), and thus, were it necessary here, we
would be obliged to assess whether each condition was met, without regard to whether the parties believe it to be satisfied.

ple punishments, but by its very terms embodies the broaderprinciple, " `deeply ingrained in . . . the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence,' " that it is intolerable for " `the State,with all its resources . . . to make repeated attempts to convict an individual [defendant], thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to livein a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity.' " 431 U. S.,

at 661-662 (quoting Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184,187-188 (1957)). We found that immediate appeal was the
only way to give "full protection" to this constitutional right"not to face trial at all." 431 U. S., at 662, and n. 7; see also
Helstoski v. Meanor, 442 U. S. 500 (1979) (decision denying
immunity under the Speech and Debate Clause would be
appealable under $ 1291).

Abney's rationale was applied in Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457
U. S. 731, 742 (1982), where we held to be similarly appealable an order denying the petitioner absolute immunity from
suit for civil damages arising from actions taken while petitioner was President of the United States. Seeing this immunity as a "functionally mandated incident of the President's unique office, rooted in the . . . separation of powers
and supported by our history," id., at 749, we stressed that
it served "compelling public ends," id., at 758, and would be
irretrievably lost if the former President were not allowed
an immediate appeal to vindicate this right to be free from
the rigors of trial, see id., at 752, n. 32.

Next, in Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511 (1985), we held
that similar considerations supported appeal under $ 1291
from decisions denying government officials qualified immunity from damages suits. An "essential attribute," id., at
525, of this freedom from suit for past conduct not violative
of clearly established law, we explained, is the "entitlement
not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation," id.,
at 526, one which would be "effectively lost if a case [were]
erroneously permitted to go to trial," ibid. Echoing the reasoning of Nixon v. Fitzgerald, supra (and Harlow v. Fitz511us3$65M 11-04-97 20:57:27 PAGES OPINPGT

gerald, 457 U. S. 800 (1982)), we explained that requiring anofficial with a colorable immunity claim to defend a suit for

damages would be "peculiarly disruptive of effective govern-ment," and would work the very "distraction . . . from . . .
dut[y], inhibition of discretionary action, and deterrence ofable people from public service" that qualified immunity was
meant to avoid. See 472 U. S., at 526 (internal quotationmarks omitted); see also

Puerto Rico Aqueduct and SewerAuthority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139, 147 (1993)

(State's Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federalcourt may be vindicated by immediate appeal under $ 1291).

D
Digital puts this case on all fours with Mitchell. It main-tains that it obtained dual rights under the settlement agreement with Desktop, not only a broad defense to liability butthe "right not to stand trial," the latter being just like the
qualified immunity held immediately appealable in Mitchell.As in

Mitchell, that right must be enforceable on collateralorder appeal, Digital asserts, or an adverse trial ruling will

destroy it forever.While Digital's argument may exert some pull on a narrow
analysis, it does not hold up under the broad scrutiny towhich all claims of immediate appealability under $ 1291
must be subjected. To be sure, Abney and Mitchell arefairly cited for the proposition that orders denying certain
immunities are strong candidates for prompt appeal under$ 1291. But Digital's larger contention, that a party's ability
to characterize a district court's decision as denying an irrep-arable "right not to stand trial" altogether is sufficient as
well as necessary for a collateral order appeal, is neither anaccurate distillation of our case law nor an appealing prospect for adding to it.Even as they have recognized the need for immediate appeals under $ 1291 to vindicate rights that would be "irre-trievably lost," Richardson-Merrell, 472 U. S., at 431, if re511us3$65M 11-04-97 20:57:27 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
view were confined to final judgments only, our cases have
been at least as emphatic in recognizing that the jurisdiction
of the courts of appeals should not, and cannot, depend on a
party's agility in so characterizing the right asserted. This
must be so because the strong bias of $ 1291 against piecemeal appeals almost never operates without some cost. A
fully litigated case can no more be untried than the law's
proverbial bell can be unrung, and almost every pretrial or
trial order might be called "effectively unreviewable" in the
sense that relief from error can never extend to rewriting
history. Thus, erroneous evidentiary rulings, grants or
denials of attorney disqualification, see, e. g., RichardsonMerrell, supra, and restrictions on the rights of intervening
parties, see Stringfellow v. Concerned Neighbors in Action,
480 U. S. 370 (1987), may burden litigants in ways that are
only imperfectly reparable by appellate reversal of a final
district court judgment, cf. Carroll, 354 U. S., at 406; Parr v.
United States, 351 U. S. 513, 519-520 (1956); and other errors, real enough, will not seem serious enough to warrant
reversal at all, when reviewed after a long trial on the merits, see Stringfellow, supra. In still other cases, see Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463 (1978), an erroneous
district court decision will, as a practical matter, sound the
"death knell" for many plaintiffs' claims that might have gone
forward if prompt error correction had been an option. But
if immediate appellate review were available every such
time, Congress's final decision rule would end up a pretty
puny one, and so the mere identification of some interest that
would be "irretrievably lost" has never sufficed to meet the
third Cohen requirement. See generally Lauro Lines s.r.l.
v. Chasser, 490 U. S. 495, 499 (1989) ("It is always true, however, that `there is value . . . in triumphing before trial,
rather than after it' ") (quoting United States v. MacDonald,

Opinion of the Court
Nor does limiting the focus to whether the interest asserted may be called a "right not to stand trial" offer much
protection against the urge to push the $ 1291 limits. We
have, after all, acknowledged that virtually every right that
could be enforced appropriately by pretrial dismissal might
loosely be described as conferring a "right not to stand trial,"
see, e. g., Midland Asphalt, 489 U. S., at 501; Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U. S., at 524. Allowing immediate appeals to vindicate every such right would move $ 1291 aside
for claims that the district court lacks personal jurisdiction,
see Van Cauwenberghe, supra, that the statute of limitations
has run, see 15B C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal
Practice and Procedure $ 3918.5, and n. 65, p. 521 (1992), that
the movant has been denied his Sixth Amendment right to a
speedy trial, see MacDonald, supra, that an action is barred
on claim preclusion principles, that no material fact is in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, or merely that the complaint fails to state a claim.
Such motions can be made in virtually every case, see generally id., at 862; United States v. Hollywood Motor Car Co.,
458 U. S., at 270, and it would be no consolation that a party's
meritless summary judgment motion or res judicata claim
was rejected on immediate appeal; the damage to the efficient and congressionally mandated allocation of judicial responsibility would be done, and any improper purpose the
appellant might have had in saddling its opponent with cost
and delay would be accomplished. Cf. Richardson-Merrell,
supra, at 434 (appeals from "entirely proper" decisions impose the same costs as do appeals from "injudicious" ones).
Thus, precisely because candor forces us to acknowledge that
there is no single, "obviously correct way to characterize"
an asserted right, Lauro Lines, supra, at 500, we have held
that $ 1291 requires courts of appeals to view claims of a
"right not to be tried" with skepticism, if not a jaundiced
eye. Cf. Van Cauwenberghe, supra, at 524-525.

Opinion of the Court
In Midland Asphalt, for example, we had no trouble indispatching a defendant's claim of entitlement to an immediate appeal from an order denying dismissal for alleged viola-tion of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), forbidding
disclosure of secret grand jury information. Noting " `a cru-cial distinction between a right not to be tried and a right
whose remedy requires the dismissal of charges,' " 489 U. S.,at 801, quoting

Hollywood Motor Car, supra, at 269, we ob-served that Rule 6(e) "contains no hint," 489 U. S., at 802, of

an immunity from trial, and we contrasted that Rule withthe Fifth Amendment's express provision that "[n]o person
shall be held to answer" for a serious crime absent grandjury indictment. Only such an "explicit statutory or constitutional guarantee that trial will not occur," we suggested,
id., at 801, could be grounds for an immediate appeal of rightunder $ 1291.

4

The characterization issue surfaced again (and more omi-nously for Digital, see

infra, at 880) in Lauro Lines, supra,where a defendant sought to appeal under $ 1291 from an

order denying effect to a contractual provision that a Neapol-itan court would be the forum for trying all disputes arising
from the parties' cruise-ship agreement. While we realizedof course that the value of the forum-selection clause would
be diminished if the defendant could be tried before appeal-ing, we saw the contractual right to limit trial to an Italian
forum as "different in kind" from the entitlement to "avoid

4 That reasoning echoed our decision one Term earlier in Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U. S. 517 (1988), where we unanimously rejected the
contention that a defendant brought to the United States under an extradition treaty could appeal immediately under $ 1291 from a decision denying
a motion to dismiss based on the principle of "specialty," which he asserted
immunized him from service of civil process in the United States. Even
if such an immunity might supply a basis for vacating a judgment on appeal, we held, the right "should be characterized as the right not to be
subject to a binding judgment of the court," and so understood, it could
therefore "be effectively vindicated following final judgment." Id., at
526-527.

suit altogether" that Abney and Mitchell held could be "ade-quately vindica[ted]" only on immediate appeal. 490 U. S.,

at 501. E

As Digital reads the cases, the only things standing in theway of an appeal to perfect its claimed rights under the settlement agreement are the lone statement in Midland Asphalt, to the effect that only explicit statutory and constitu-tional immunities may be appealed immediately under $ 1291,

and language (said to be stray) repeated in many of ourcollateral order decisions, suggesting that the "importance"
of the right asserted is an independent condition of appeal-ability. See Brief for Petitioner 28-34. The first, Digital
explains, cannot be reconciled with Mitchell's holding, thatdenial of qualified immunity (which we would be hard pressed
to call "explicitly . . . guarantee[d]" by a particular constitu-tional or statutory provision) is a collateral order under

$ 1291; as between Mitchell and the Midland Asphalt dic-tum, Digital says, the dictum must give way. As for the
second obstacle, Digital adamantly maintains that "impor-tance" has no place in a doctrine justified as supplying a gloss
on Congress's "final decision" language.

1
These arguments miss the mark. First, even if Mitchellcould not be squared fully with the literal words of the

Mid-land Asphalt sentence (but cf. Lauro Lines, 490 U. S., at 499,

noting that Midland Asphalt was a criminal case and Mitch-ell was not), that would be only because the qualified immunity right is inexplicit, not because it lacks a good pedigreein public law. Indeed, the insight that explicitness may not
be needed for jurisdiction consistent with $ 1291 only leavesDigital with the unenviable task of explaining why other
rights that might fairly be said to include an (implicit) "rightto avoid trial" aspect are less in need of protection by immediate review, or more readily vindicated on appeal from final

judgment, than the (claimed) privately negotiated right to befree from suit. It is far from clear, for example, why $ 1291

should bless a party who bargained for the right to avoidtrial, but not a party who "purchased" the right by having
once prevailed at trial and now pleads res judicata, see In
re Corrugated Container Antitrust Litigation v. WillametteIndustries, Inc., 694 F. 2d 1041 (CA5 1983); or a party who

seeks shelter under the statute of limitations, see, e. g.,United States v. Weiss, 7 F. 3d 1088 (CA2 1993), which is
usually understood to secure the same sort of "repose" thatDigital seeks to vindicate here, see Brief for Petitioner 25;
or a party not even subject to a claim on which relief couldbe granted. See also

Cobbledick, 309 U. S., at 325 ("Bearingthe discomfiture and cost of a prosecution for crime even by

an innocent person is one of the painful obligations of citizen-ship"); Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U. S. 368,
378 (1981) ("[P]otential harm" should be compared to "theharm resulting from other interlocutory orders that may be
erroneous") (internal quotation marks omitted).Digital answers that the status under $ 1291 of these other
(seemingly analogous) rights should not give us pause, be-cause the text and structure of this particular settlement
with Desktop confer what no res judicata claimant could everhave, an express right not to stand trial.

5 But we cannot

attach much significance one way or another to the supposedclarity of the agreement's terms in this case. To ground a

ruling here on whether this settlement agreement in termsconfers the prized "right not to stand trial" (a point Desktop
by no means concedes) would flout our own frequent admoni-tions, see,

e. g., Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U. S., at 529, thatavailability of collateral order appeal must be determined at

Opinion of the Court
a higher level of generality. Indeed, just because it wouldbe the rare settlement agreement that could not be construed to include (at least an implicit) freedom-from-trial"aspect," we decide this case on the assumption that if Digital prevailed here, any district court order denying effect toa settlement agreement could be appealed immediately.
(And even if form were held to matter, settlement agree-ments would all include "immunity from suit" language a
good deal plainer than what Digital relies on here, see Tr. ofOral Arg. 44.) See also

Van Cauwenberghe, supra, at 524("For purposes of determining appealability, . . . we will

assume, but do not decide, that petitioner has presented asubstantial claim" on the merits).

The more fundamental response, however, to the claimthat an agreement's provision for immunity from trial can

6 Similarly, we must reject as patently irrelevant for $ 1291 purposes
Digital's repeated claims that the District Court applied the "wrong legal
standard" in granting Desktop's motion to vacate the dismissal order. If
Digital is right that a settlement agreement confers a contractual "immunity from suit," that protection is no more "irretrievably lost," and thus
no more appealable under $ 1291, when a district court applies an erroneous legal standard than when it commits a plain vanilla mistake in misapplying the proper standard.

Nor do we accept uncritically Digital's novel and highly convenient
contention that such a right to be free from trial is, either in this case
or generally, more valuable than other rights conferred by a settlement
agreement. See infra, at 881-882. While Digital emphasizes that, under
the terms of the settlement here, Desktop is owed a larger sum for "dismissal of the above referenced lawsuit and a waiver of all damages" than
for "all rights to the Trademarks," that proves little, if anything. To compare those two amounts is to place the bargained-for damages waiver on
the wrong side of the ledger: that (typically quite valuable) right is precisely the sort that is fully vindicable on postjudgment appeal. Moreover,
even if a high price tag might otherwise be an indicator of a right's "importance" to the benefited party, we cannot ignore that settlement agreement
"prices" may be structured for tax, accounting, and business strategy reasons that have nothing to do with their true value to the party.

878 DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORP. v. DESKTOP DIRECT, INC.

Opinion of the Court
distinguish it from other arguable rights to be trial free issimply that such a right by agreement does not rise to the

level of importance needed for recognition under $ 1291.This, indeed, is the bone of the fiercest contention in the case.
In disparaging any distinction between an order denying a
claim grounded on an explicit constitutional guarantee ofimmunity from trial and an order at odds with an equally

explicit right by private agreement of the parties, Digitalstresses that the relative "importance" of these rights, heavily relied upon by the Court of Appeals, is a rogue factor.No decision of this Court, Digital maintains, has held an
order unappealable as "unimportant" when it has otherwise
met the three Cohen requirements, and whether a decided
issue is thought "important," it says, should have no bearing
on whether it is "final" under $ 1291.

If "finality" were as narrow a concept as Digital maintains,
however, the Court would have had little reason to go beyond the first factor in Cohen, see also United States v.
243.22 Acres of Land in Babylon, Suffolk Cty., 129 F. 2d 678,
680 (CA2 1942) (Frank, J.) (" `Final' is not a clear one-purpose
word"). And if "importance" were truly aberrational, we
would not find it featured so prominently in the Cohen opinion itself, which describes the "small class" of immediately
appealable prejudgment decisions in terms of rights that are
"too important to be denied review" right away, see 337
U. S., at 546. To be sure, Digital may validly question
whether "importance" is a factor "beyond" the three Cohen
conditions or whether it is best considered, as we have sometimes suggested it should be, in connection with the second,
"separability," requirement, see, e. g., Coopers & Lybrand,
437 U. S., at 468; Lauro Lines, 490 U. S., at 498, but neither
enquiry could lead to the conclusion that "importance" is
itself unimportant. To the contrary, the third Cohen question, whether a right is "adequately vindicable" or "effectively reviewable," simply cannot be answered without a
judgment about the value of the interests that would be lost

through rigorous application of a final judgment require-ment. See generally

Van Cauwenberghe, supra, at 524
(" `[T]he substance of the rights entailed, rather than theadvantage to a litigant in winning his claim sooner,' " is dispositive) (quoting MacDonald, 435 U. S., at 860, n. 7);
Lauro Lines, supra, at 502-503 (Scalia, J., concurring).While there is no need to decide here that a privately conferred right could never supply the basis of a collateral orderappeal, but cf. n. 7,

infra (discussing 9 U. S. C. $ 16), there
are surely sound reasons for treating such rights differentlyfrom those originating in the Constitution or statutes.

When a policy is embodied in a constitutional or statutory
provision entitling a party to immunity from suit (a rare
form of protection), there is little room for the judiciary to
gainsay its "importance." Including a provision in a private
contract, by contrast, is barely a prima facie indication that
the right secured is "important" to the benefited party (contracts being replete with boilerplate), let alone that its value
exceeds that of other rights not embodied in agreements
(e. g., the right to be free from a second suit based on a claim
that has already been litigated), or that it qualifies as "important" in Cohen's sense, as being weightier than the societal
interests advanced by the ordinary operation of final judgment principles. Where statutory and constitutional rights
are concerned, "irretrievabl[e] los[s]" can hardly be trivial,
and the collateral order doctrine might therefore be understood as reflecting the familiar principle of statutory construction that, when possible, courts should construe statutes (here $ 1291) to foster harmony with other statutory and
constitutional law, see, e. g., Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co.,
467 U. S. 986, 1018 (1984); United States ex rel. Milwaukee
Social Democratic Publishing Co. v. Burleson, 255 U. S. 407,
437-438 (1921) (Holmes, J., dissenting). But it is one thing
to say that the policy of $ 1291 to avoid piecemeal litigation
should be reconciled with policies embodied in other statutes
or the Constitution, and quite another to suggest that this

public policy may be trumped routinely by the expectationsor clever drafting of private parties.

Indeed, we do not take issue with the Tenth Circuit's ob-servation that this case shares more in common with

Lauro
Lines than with Mitchell. It is hard to see how, for pur-poses of $ 1291, the supposedly explicit "right not to be tried"

element of the settlement agreement in this case differs from
the unarguably explicit, privately negotiated "right not to betried in any forum other than Naples, Italy," in that one.

There, no less than here (if Digital reads the settlementagreement correctly), one private party secured from another a promise not to bring suit for reasons that presumablyincluded avoiding the burden, expense, and perhaps embarrassment of a certain class of trials (all but Neapolitan ones
or, here, all prompted by Desktop). Cf. Lauro Lines, supra,at 501 (asserted right was "surely as effectively vindicable"

on final judgment appeal as was the right in Van Cauwenberghe).8 The losing argument in Lauro Lines should be a
losing argument here.

7 This is not to say that rights originating in a private agreement may
never be important enough to warrant immediate appeal. To the contrary, Congress only recently enacted a statute, 102 Stat. 4671, see 9
U. S. C. $ 16 (1988 ed., Supp. IV), essentially providing for immediate appeal when a district court rejects a party's assertion that, under the Arbitration Act, a case belongs before a commercial arbitrator and not in court,
a measure predicted to have a "sweeping impact," 15B C. Wright, A.
Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 3914.17, p. 11 (1992);
see generally id., at 7-38. That courts must give full effect to this express congressional judgment that particular policies require that private
rights be vindicable immediately, however, by no means suggests that they
should now be more ready to make similar judgments for themselves. Congress has expressed no parallel sentiment, to the effect that settlementagreement rights are, as a matter of federal policy, similarly "too important" to be denied immediate review.

8 To be fair, the Lauro Lines opinion does contain language that, taken

alone, might lend succor to petitioner's claim, see 490 U. S., at 501 ("[A]n
entitlement to avoid suit is different in kind from an entitlement to be
sued only in a particular forum"), but the opinion is not easily read as

Opinion of the Court
Nor are we swayed by Digital's last-ditch effort to comewithin Cohen's sense of "importance" by trying to show that

settlement-agreement "immunities" merit first-class treat-ment for purposes of collateral order appeal, because they
advance the public policy favoring voluntary resolution ofdisputes. It defies common sense to maintain that parties'
readiness to settle will be significantly dampened (or the cor-responding public interest impaired) by a rule that a district
court's decision to let allegedly barred litigation go forwardmay be challenged as a matter of right only on appeal from
a judgment for the plaintiff 's favor.

III

A

Even, finally, if the term "importance" were to be exor-cised from the

Cohen analysis altogether, Digital's rightswould remain "adequately vindicable" or "effectively reviewable" on final judgment to an extent that other immunities,like the right to be free from a second trial on a criminal
charge, are not. As noted already, experience suggests thatfreedom from trial is rarely the

sine qua non (or "the es-sence," see Van Cauwenberghe, 486 U. S., at 525) of a negotiated settlement agreement. Avoiding the burden of a trialis no doubt a welcome incident of out-of-court dispute resolution ( just as it is for parties who prevail on pretrial motions),but in the run-of-the-mill cases this boon will rarely compare
with the " `embarrassment' " and " `anxiety' " averted by asuccessful double jeopardy claimant, see

Abney, 431 U. S., at661-662, or the " `distraction from . . . dut[y],' " Mitchell, 472

endorsing Digital's claim that a privately negotiated right not to stand
trial would be immediately appealable. To the contrary, Lauro Lines expressly adopted (at least for criminal appeals) Midland Asphalt's limitation that " `[a] right not to be tried in the sense relevant to the Cohen
exception rests upon an explicit statutory or constitutional guarantee,' "
490 U. S., at 499, quoting 489 U. S., at 801, and stated that the collateral
order doctrine operates "[s]imilarly" in civil cases, 490 U. S., at 499.

882 DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORP. v. DESKTOP DIRECT, INC.

Opinion of the Court
U. S., at 526, avoided by qualified immunity. Judged withinthe four corners of the settlement agreement, avoiding trial

probably pales in comparison with the benefit of limiting ex-posure to liability (an interest that is fully vindicable on appeal from final judgment). In the rare case where a party
had a special reason, apart from the generic desire to tri-umph early, for having bargained for an immunity from trial,

e. g., an unusual interest in preventing disclosure of particu-lar information, it may seek protection from the district
court.The case for adequate vindication without immediate appeal is strengthened, moreover, by recognizing that a settling party has a source of recompense unknown to trial
immunity claimants dependent on public law alone. The essence of Digital's claim here is that Desktop, for valuable
consideration, promised not to sue, and we have been given
no reason to doubt that Utah law provides for the enforcement of that promise in the same way that other rights arising from private agreements are enforced, through an action
for breach of contract. See, e. g., VanDyke v. Mountain
Coin Machine Distributors, Inc., 758 P. 2d 962 (Utah App.
1988) (upholding compensatory and punitive damages award
against party pursuing suit in the face of settlement agreement); see generally 5A A. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts

$ 1251 (1964); cf. Yockey v. Horn, 880 F. 2d 945, 947 (CA7
1989) (awarding damages for breach of settlement agreement
promise not to "participate in any litigation" against plaintiff); see also Richardson-Merrell, 472 U. S., at 435, and n. 2
(existence of alternative fora for vindicating asserted rights is
relevant to appealability under $ 1291). And as for Digital's
suggestion, see Brief for Petitioner 25, that Desktop is using
this proceeding not to remedy a fraud but merely to renege
on a promise because it now thinks it should have negotiated
a better deal, when a party claims fraud or otherwise seeks
recision of a settlement for such improper purposes, its opponent need not rely on a court of appeals for protection. See

Opinion of the Court
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11 (opponent may move for sanctionwhen litigation is motivated by an "improper purpose, such

as . . . unnecessary delay or needless increase in the costof litigation").

B
In preserving the strict limitations on review as of rightunder $ 1291, our holding should cause no dismay, for the law

is not without its safety valve to deal with cases where thecontest over a settlement's enforceability raises serious legal
questions taking the case out of the ordinary run. WhileDigital's insistence that the District Court applied a fundamentally wrong legal standard in vacating the dismissalorder here may not be considered in deciding appealability
under $ 1291, see n. 6, supra, it plainly is relevant to theavailability of the discretionary interlocutory appeal from
particular district court orders "involv[ing] a controllingquestion of law as to which there is substantial ground for
difference of opinion," provided for in $ 1292(b) of Title 28.Indeed, because we suppose that a defendant's claimed entitlement to a privately negotiated "immunity from suit" couldin some instances raise "a controlling question of law . . .
[which] . . . may materially advance the ultimate terminationof the litigation," the discretionary appeal provision (allowing courts to consider the merits of individual claims) wouldseem a better vehicle for vindicating serious contractual
interpretation claims than the blunt, categorical instrumentof $ 1291 collateral order appeal. See Van Cauwenberghe,
486 U. S., at 529-530 (internal quotation marks omitted);
Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U. S., at 474-475.9

9 We recognize that $ 1292 is not a panacea, both because it depends to
a degree on the indulgence of the court from which review is sought and
because the discretion to decline to hear an appeal is broad, see, e. g.,
Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U. S., at 475 (serious docket congestion may be
adequate reason to support denial of certified appeal). On the other hand,
we find nothing in the text or purposes of either statute to justify the
concern, expressed here by Digital, that a party's request to appeal under

884 DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORP. v. DESKTOP DIRECT, INC.

Opinion of the Court

IV
The words of $ 1291 have long been construed to recognizethat certain categories of prejudgment decisions exist for

which it is both justifiable and necessary to depart from thegeneral rule, that "the whole case and every matter in controversy in it [must be] decided in a single appeal." McLishv.

Roff, 141 U. S. 661, 665-666 (1891). But denying effect tothe sort of (asserted) contractual right at issue here is far

removed from those immediately appealable decisions involv-ing rights more deeply rooted in public policy, and the rights
Digital asserts may, in the main, be vindicated throughmeans less disruptive to the orderly administration of justice
than immediate, mandatory appeal. We accordingly holdthat a refusal to enforce a settlement agreement claimed to
shelter a party from suit altogether does not supply the basisfor immediate appeal under $ 1291. The judgment of the
Court of Appeals is therefore Affirmed.

$ 1292(b) might operate, practically or legally, to prejudice its claimed right
to immediate appeal under $ 1291.

to Justice Kennedy, and by him referred to the Court, denied.Certiorari denied. The order heretofore entered by Justice
Kennedy is vacated. Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburgwould grant the application for stay of execution.

Justice Blackmun, dissenting.
Even if I had not reached the conclusion that the death penaltycannot be imposed fairly within the constraints of our Constitution, see my dissent in Callins v. Collins, 510 U. S. 1141, 1143(1994), I could not support its imposition in this case. There is
substantial evidence that William Henry Hance is mentally re-tarded as well as mentally ill. There is reason to believe that
his trial and sentencing proceedings were infected with racialprejudice. One of his sentencers has come forward to say that
she did not vote for the death penalty because of his mentalimpairments. And Mr. Hance has raised a colorable claim that
the trial court's refusal to answer his jurors' questions about sen-tencing options should be held and considered in light of the
forthcoming decision in Simmons v. South Carolina, No. 92-9059,pending before this Court. Accordingly, I would grant the application for a stay, grant the petition for writ of certiorari, andvacate the death sentence in this case.

Thomas, J., dissenting1060
Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins, dissenting.
Petitioner Ian Hoffman brought suit under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42U. S. C. $ 1983, against respondents, Kentucky's Cabinet for Human

Resources (CHR), two CHR social workers, and his former wife,Melisa Hoffman, alleging that they had deprived him of a constitutionally protected liberty interest in being allowed to visit hisminor daughter, B. H. The events giving rise to the suit began
when Melisa told the social workers that she suspected petitionerof sexually abusing B. H. The social workers obtained an ex
parte order from a state court that suspended petitioner's visita-tion rights. The District Court held that the social workers were
absolutely immune from damages liability under $ 1983 for thisconduct. Relying on its decision in Salyer v. Patrick, 874 F. 2d
374 (CA6 1989), the Court of Appeals affirmed. I would grantcertiorari to address petitioner's challenge to that ruling.

In Salyer, the Sixth Circuit held that, "due to their quasi-prosecutorial function in the initiation of child abuse proceedings,"
social workers are absolutely immune from liability for filing juve-nile abuse petitions. Id., at 378. Other courts addressing the
question have agreed that social workers are entitled to absoluteimmunity under $ 1983 in some instances, depending on their conduct and the terms of the state laws pursuant to which theyacted. See,

e. g., Meyers v. Contra Costa County Dept. of SocialServs., 812 F. 2d 1154, 1157 (CA9) (holding that "social workers

are entitled to absolute immunity in performing quasi-prosecutorial functions connected with the initiation and pursuit
of child dependency proceedings"), cert. denied, 484 U. S. 829(1987);

Vosburg v. Department of Social Servs., 884 F. 2d 133(CA4 1989) (granting absolute immunity to social workers in connection with their filing of a child removal petition in juvenilecourt); Snell v. Tunnell, 920 F. 2d 673 (CA10 1990) (denying absolute immunity to social workers for conduct in seeking a pro-tective custody order that did not initiate juvenile court proceedings), cert. denied, 499 U. S. 976 (1991). These courts havereasoned that social workers function as prosecutors in certain
contexts, and therefore are entitled to the absolute immunity thatwould be due a prosecutor performing analogous functions. Cf.
Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409 (1976) (discussing prosecuto-rial immunity).

1062 OCTOBER TERM, 1993

Thomas, J., dissenting 511 U. S.
Consideration of the function performed by an official seekingabsolute immunity plays an important role in our immunity analysis. See, e. g., Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U. S. 259, 269 (1993).Function, however, becomes significant only when evaluated in
historical context. A related inquiry precedes the functionalanalysis: "Our initial inquiry is whether an official claiming immunity under $ 1983 can point to a common-law counterpart to theprivilege he asserts." Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 339-340
(1986) (emphasis added). Although $ 1983 "on its face admits ofno defense of official immunity," "[c]ertain immunities were so
well established in 1871, when $ 1983 was enacted, that `we pre-sume that Congress would have specifically so provided had it
wished to abolish' them." Buckley, supra, at 268 (quoting Pier-son v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 554-555 (1967)). We therefore have
held that some officials are, under certain circumstances, entitledto absolute immunity. See, e. g., Imbler, supra. An official seeking such immunity, however, must at the outset show that a "coun-terpart to the privilege he asserts" was recognized at common
law in 1871, for "[w]here we have found that a tradition of abso-lute immunity did not exist as of 1871, we have refused to grant
such immunity under $ 1983." Burns v. Reed, 500 U. S. 478, 498(1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting

in part).The courts that have accorded absolute immunity to social
workers appear to have overlooked the necessary historical in-quiry; none has seriously considered whether social workers enjoyed absolute immunity for their official duties in 1871. If theydid not, absolute immunity is unavailable to social workers under

$ 1983. See ibid. This all assumes, of course, that "social work-ers" (at least as we now understand the term) even existed in
1871. If that assumption is false, the argument for granting abso-lute immunity becomes (at least) more difficult to maintain. Cf.
Antoine v. Byers & Anderson, Inc., 508 U. S. 429 (1993) (denyingcourt reporter absolute immunity in large part because official
court reporters did not begin appearing in state courts until thelate 19th century).

It may be argued that the Sixth Circuit and other courts haveeffectively identified a common-law counterpart to the modern
social worker for purposes of the immunity analysis: the 1871prosecutor. In reasoning that the social worker functions as a
prosecutor in performing certain duties, these courts essentially

511ord$$1t 11-17-97 21:57:38 PGT*ORD1PP (Prelim. Print)

1063ORDERS
April 25, 1994511 U. S.
have suggested that, by analogy, the historically rooted immunityfor prosecutors should apply to social workers. In the absence
of a detailed examination of the immunity (if any) that applied tosocial workers in 1871, however, such an analogy must be suspect.
But even putting historical concerns aside, it is not clear to methat the functional analysis of the Sixth Circuit is correct. I am
not convinced that social workers, who often are involved in civilfamily welfare proceedings, can ever function as prosecutors for
purposes of $ 1983 immunity analysis. Cf. Imbler, supra, at 430(absolute prosecutorial immunity extends to those functions "intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process")(emphasis added).

Of course, the decision below and other decisions granting abso-lute immunity to social workers may be premised more on the
notion that absolute immunity serves important policy concernsthan on either historical or functional analyses. See, e. g., Meyers, 812 F. 2d, at 1157. To the extent they are so based, they aremisguided: The federal courts "do not have a license to establish
immunities from $ 1983 actions in the interests of what [they]judge to be sound public policy." Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S. 914,
922-923 (1984).We should address the important threshold question whether
social workers are, under any circumstances, entitled to absoluteimmunity. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

the traditional practice of this Court, however, to decline to re-view claims raised for the first time on rehearing in the court

on a petition for rehearing come too late for consideration here,unless the State court exerted its jurisdiction [over them on rehearing]") (emphasis added). Following this practice here makesgood sense because we do not have the benefit of a decision analyzing the application of Penry to the facts of petitioner's case.Petitioner is free to bring his Penry claim to the attention of the
Texas courts in a postconviction proceeding. See Ex parte Kun-kle, 852 S. W. 2d 499, 502, n. 3 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993) (Penry
claims are cognizable in state habeas despite an applicant's failureto raise them on direct appeal). If he is unsuccessful in state
court, petitioner can proceed to federal court and petition for awrit of habeas corpus. Because these avenues of relief are sufficient to afford full review of petitioner's substantial constitutionalclaim, I concur in the denial of the petition for a writ of certiorari.

Justice Blackmun, dissenting.
Petitioner Bobby Joe Wills, a mentally retarded capital defend-ant who was 17 at the time of his offense, was sentenced to death

in Texas without the jury's being allowed to give mitigating effectto his mental impairment. Petitioner's death sentence thus was
imposed in direct violation of Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302(1989), and is devoid of the reliability the Constitution requires
before death can be the appropriate punishment. See Woodsonv. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, 305 (1976) (opinion of Stewart,
Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).Petitioner has an IQ of 61.

1 At his trial in 1985, petitioner's

counsel introduced evidence of petitioner's mental retardation tochallenge only the reliability of his confession and his mens rea

to commit the offense. At the close of the guilt phase, the prose-cutor admonished the jury not to " `have any sympathy for the
defendant because he's a little slow or he's borderline mentallyretarded . . . . Don't say, Poor Old Bobby Joe, he's a little slow,
he's borderline mentally retarded. Let's give him a break.' "

1 At the time of petitioner's trial, the American Association on Mental
Retardation classified individuals with an IQ score between 50-55 and 70 ashaving "mild" retardation. See Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 308, n. 1

(1989). In 1992, the association revised its classification to identify individu-als with an IQ of 75 or below as presumptively retarded. See AAMR, Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 14 (9thed. 1992).

Pet. for Cert. 10. At the penalty phase, the jurors were askedto answer Texas' two standard "special issues": "Did [Wills] act
deliberately when he murdered . . . ? Is there a probability thathe will be dangerous in the future?" See

Penry, 492 U. S., at320. The prosecutor repeatedly commanded the jurors to consider only these questions and reminded them: " `You're not asked,"Was the defendant given an unfair chance at life?" ' " Pet. for
Cert. 11. After reviewing petitioner's unstable past, the prosecu-tor concluded that "all the counselors and all the psychologists
and all the teachers and all the case workers and all the supervi-sors can't do anything for Bobby Joe Wills.

They can't rehabili-tate Bobby Joe Wills." Ibid. (emphasis added). The jury returned affirmative answers to both special issues and sentencedpetitioner to death.

Penry v. Lynaugh was decided while petitioner's direct appealwas pending. Recognizing that mental retardation may render a
defendant "less morally `culpable than defendants who have nosuch excuse,' " 492 U. S., at 322, quoting

California v. Brown, 479U. S. 538, 545 (1987) (
O'Connor, J., concurring), this Court heldthat Texas' execution of a mentally retarded defendant, without

the jury's being instructed that it could consider and give mitigat-ing effect to his mental impairment in imposing sentence, would
violate the Eighth Amendment. A rational juror, this Court ob-served, readily could conclude that a mentally retarded capital
defendant had killed deliberately and was likely to be dangerousin the future, while also concluding that mercy and the defendant's
reduced culpability for the crime made his execution inappropriate. Texas' capital sentencing scheme allowed a jury to give ef-fect to the former conclusion but not the latter, and thus eliminated "a constitutionally indispensable part of the process ofinflicting the penalty of death."

Woodson, 428 U. S., at 304 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).

Like Penry, petitioner was condemned to die by the State ofTexas without the jury's ever having had an opportunity to give

a "reasoned moral response to the defendant's background, char-acter, and crime."

Brown, 479 U. S., at 545 (O'Connor, J., concurring). His sentence therefore runs the constitutionally intol-erable risk that the death penalty has been imposed despite the

presence of factors that may justify a sentence less than death.

It is possible that petitioner's claims may be better addressedin state and federal postconviction proceedings. Even if I did

not believe that the death penalty cannot be fairly administeredwithin the constraints of our Constitution, see Callins v. Collins,
510 U. S. 1141, 1143 (1994) (Blackmun, J., dissenting from denialof certiorari), however, because the execution of this mentally
retarded juvenile offender would constitute a miscarriage of jus-tice, I would grant the petition, vacate the death sentence, and
remand for resentencing. I therefore dissent.

2 Petitioner additionally claims that the execution of mentally retarded juvenile offenders is cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the EighthAmendment. This Court has recognized that youth, like mental retardation,

reduces a defendant's criminal culpability and may render the imposition ofsociety's ultimate retributive sanction inappropriate. See, e. g., Eddings v.
Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 115-116 (1982); Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S.815 (1988) (striking death sentence for juvenile offender under age 16); but
see Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361 (1989) (declining to declare capitalpunishment per se invalid for juvenile offenders age 16 or older). That such
executions violate society's "evolving standards of decency," Trop v. Dulles,356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion), is consistent, of course, with international practice, which condemns the execution of both the mentally dis-abled and juvenile offenders. At least 72 countries that retain the death
penalty restrict its administration to persons age 18 or over at the time ofthe offense. Amnesty International, Open Letter to the President on the
Death Penalty 8, n. 10 (1994). The United States thus "stands almost alonein the world in still executing offenders who were under-18 at the time of
the crime." Id., at 8. See generally W. Schabas, The Abolition of theDeath Penalty in International Law (1993).

and to ask such questions is improper," id., at 772 (adding that"proper questioning . . . should be limited to asking jurors if they
knew of any reason why they could not sit, if they would haveany difficulty in following the law as given by the court, or if
they would have any difficulty in sitting in judgment").

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins, dissenting.
During jury selection for petitioner's trial on a charge of aggra-vated robbery, the prosecutor used a peremptory strike to remove

a black man from the venire. Petitioner, who is black, objectedon Batson grounds and requested a race-neutral explanation for
the strike. See Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, 97 (1986). Theprosecutor responded that she had struck the venireman because
he was a Jehovah's Witness and explained that "[i]n my experi-ence Jahovah Witness [sic] are reluctant to exercise authority
over their fellow human beings in this Court House." 504N. W. 2d 767, 768 (Minn. 1993). The trial court accepted that
reason for the strike and proceeded to trial. Petitioner subse-quently was convicted.

On appeal, petitioner conceded that the prosecutor's explanationfor the strike was race neutral, but contended that Batson should
be extended to prohibit peremptory strikes based on religion.The Supreme Court of Minnesota rejected petitioner's Batson
argument and affirmed the conviction. The court reasoned thatthis Court has never held that "Batson should extend beyond
race-based peremptory challenges," and noted that "Batson, itself,speaks solely of the need to eradicate racial discrimination."
Ibid. Acknowledging that "[i]f the life of the law were logicrather than experience, Batson might well be extended to include
religious bias and, for that matter, an endless number of otherbiases," id., at 769, the court nevertheless concluded that, because
Batson had been confined by this Court to the context of race, itshould not be broadened to reach petitioner's claim in this case,
504 N. W. 2d, at 772.I find it difficult to understand how the Court concludes today
that the judgment of the court below should not be vacated andthe case remanded in light of our recent decision in J. E. B.
v. Alabama ex rel. T. B., ante, p. 127, which shatters the Su-preme Court of Minnesota's understanding that Batson's equal
protection analysis applies solely to racially based peremptorystrikes. It is abundantly clear that the lower court was relying

511ord$$2w 11-03-97 16:36:53 PGT*ORDPP (Prelim. Print)

1117ORDERS
Thomas, J., dissenting1115
on just such a reading of Batson, for it reasoned that Batsonembodies " `a special rule of relevance' " that operates only in the
context of race, and concluded that " `[o]utside the uniquely sensi-tive area of race the ordinary rule that a prosecutor may strike
without giving any reason applies.' " 504 N. W. 2d, at 771-772(quoting Brown v. North Carolina, 479 U. S. 940, 942 (1986)
(O'Connor, J., concurring in denial of certiorari)). In extendingEqual Protection Clause analysis to prohibit strikes exercised on
the basis of sex, J. E. B. explicitly disavowed that understandingof Batson.

Indeed, given the Court's rationale in J. E. B., no principledreason immediately appears for declining to apply Batson to any
strike based on a classification that is accorded heightened scru-tiny under the Equal Protection Clause. The Court's decision in
J. E. B. was explicitly grounded on a conclusion that peremptorystrikes based on sex cannot survive "heightened scrutiny" under
the Clause, ante, at 135, because such strikes "are not substan-tially related to an important government objective," ante, at 137,
n. 6. In breaking the barrier between classifications that meritstrict equal protection scrutiny and those that receive what we
have termed "heightened" or "intermediate" scrutiny, J. E. B.would seem to have extended Batson's equal protection analysis
to all strikes based on the latter category of classifications--acategory which presumably would include classifications based on
religion. Cf. Larson v. Valente, 456 U. S. 228, 244-246 (1982);Batson, supra, at 124 (Burger, C. J., dissenting). It is at least
not obvious, given the reasoning in J. E. B., why peremptorystrikes based on religious affiliation would survive equal protection analysis. As Justice Scalia pointed out in dissent, J. E. B.itself provided no rationale for distinguishing between strikes exercised on the basis of various classifications that receive height-ened scrutiny, ante, at 161, and the Supreme Court of Minnesota
certainly did not develop such a distinction. As described above,the court relied expressly on the understanding that Batson was
confined to the context of race. Under these circumstances, thiscase should be remanded for the Supreme Court of Minnesota to
consider explicitly whether a principled basis exists for confiningthe holding in J. E. B. to the context of sex.

I can only conclude that the Court's decision to deny certioraristems from an unwillingness to confront forthrightly the ramifications of the decision in J. E. B. It has long been recognized

by some Members of the Court that subjecting the peremptory
strike to the rigors of equal protection analysis may ultimately
spell the doom of the strike altogether, because the peremptory
challenge is by nature " ` "an arbitrary and capricious right." ' "
Batson, supra, at 123 (Burger, C. J., dissenting) (quoting Swain
v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202, 219 (1965) (quoting Lewis v. United
States, 146 U. S. 370, 378 (1892))). Cf. J. E. B., ante, at 161-162
(Scalia, J., dissenting). Once the scope of the logic in J. E. B. is
honestly acknowledged, it cannot be glibly asserted that the decision has no implications for peremptory strikes based on classifications other than sex, or that it does not imply further restrictions on the exercise of the peremptory strike outside the context
of race and sex.

In my view, the petition should therefore be granted, the judgment below vacated, and the case remanded for reconsideration
in light of J. E. B. I respectfully dissent.

Certiorari denied. Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburgwould grant the application for stay of execution of sentence of
death. Reported below: 18 F. 3d 662.

Justice Blackmun, dissenting.
In 1853, hanging was the "nearly universal form of execution"in the United States, State v. Frampton, 95 Wash. 2d 469, 492,

627 P. 2d 922, 934 (1981), and 48 States once imposed death bythis method. Today, only Washington and Montana still employ
judicial hanging. Montana has not executed anyone by hangingin over 50 years, and no one who has contested the sentence has
been lawfully hanged in the United States in more than threedecades.

1 Petitioner Charles Rodman Campbell, who is scheduled to be executed "by hanging by the neck" in Washington thisweek,

2 contends that his hanging will constitute a cruel and unusual punishment. I agree, and accordingly, even if I believedthat the death penalty could be applied constitutionally, see Callins v. Collins, 510 U. S. 1141, 1143 (1994) (Blackmun, J., dissent-ing), I would vote to grant the application for stay and the petition for certiorari in this case.3

1 The only execution by hanging to occur since 1963 was that of Westley
Alan Dodd, who was executed in Washington last year. Dodd refused eitherto select his mode of punishment or to challenge his hanging sentence.

2 Washington's death penalty statute, Wash. Rev. Code 10.95.180(1) (1992),
provides: "The punishment of death . . . shall be inflicted either by hangingby the neck or, at the election of the defendant, by [lethal injection]." For

defendants like Campbell who are unwilling to select their mode of execu-tion, Washington imposes death by hanging.

3 Possible obstacles to review are the facts that petitioner's habeas claim
might constitute a new rule under Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989) (plu-rality opinion), and that no circuit conflict exists regarding whether hanging

is cruel and unusual. Because the only two States that retain hanging arein the Ninth Circuit, a circuit conflict on this issue is unlikely to emerge.
Though I respect that Members of this Court may disagree, I would notawait a conflict in a capital case raising a fundamental constitutional question such as this.

1120 OCTOBER TERM, 1993

Blackmun, J., dissenting 511 U. S.
This Court has accepted that the Eighth Amendment's prohibi-tion against cruel and unusual punishments "draw[s] its meaning
from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progressof a maturing society," Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958)
(plurality opinion), and that the best evidence of these evolvingstandards "is the legislation enacted by the country's legislatures," Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 331 (1989); see also Stan-ford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361, 370 (1989) (citations omitted)
(" `[F]irst' among the `objective indicia that reflect the public atti-tude toward a given sanction' are statutes passed by society's
elected representatives"); Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399, 408-410 (1986). The public condemnation of hanging is overwhelming.
Not only have 46 of the 48 States that once regularly imposedhanging abandoned the practice, but many state legislatures rejected the practice because it was perceived as inhumane andbarbaric, precisely the concern that lies at the core of the Eighth
Amendment. See, e. g., Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 296-297 (1972) (Brennan, J., concurring) ("Since the development of the
supposedly more humane methods" of lethal gas and electrocution,"hanging and shooting have virtually ceased"); Malloy v. South
Carolina, 237 U. S. 180, 185 (1915) (noting that 11 States alteredtheir practice based on "a well-grounded belief that electrocution
is less painful and more humane than hanging"). But see Glassv. Louisiana, 471 U. S. 1080 (1985) (Brennan, J., dissenting) (arguing that death by electrocution is cruel and unusual). Evenas the death penalty's popularity has increased in recent years,
toleration for hanging has steadily declined. Of the eight Statesthat provided for judicial hanging by the time of the Furman
decision, see 408 U. S., at 297, n. 50 (Brennan, J., concurring), allbut two have abolished it. Today, the only three jurisdictions in
the English-speaking world that impose state-sponsored hangingsare Washington, Montana, and South Africa.

4 App. to Pet. for

Cert. A-38.Moreover, the States' rejection of hanging has been much more

universal than that of practices this Court previously has foundto be cruel and unusual. Compare Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487

4 Hanging in South Africa also soon may be a thing of the past. Former
President F. W. de Klerk imposed a moratorium on hanging in South Africain 1990, and no one has been executed in that country since 1989. The

African National Congress has campaigned to abolish the death penalty.See N. Y. Times, Apr. 27, 1994, section A, p. 9, col. 1.

U. S. 815 (1988) (invalidating capital punishment for offendersunder age 16 where almost two-thirds of state legislatures rejected the practice); Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782 (1982)(striking down the death penalty for vicarious felony murders
where only eight States still authorized the punishment); Cokerv. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584, 595-596 (1977) (abolishing the death
penalty for rape where only Georgia imposed death for rape ofan adult and only three States imposed the penalty for any rape),
with Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S., at 371 (upholding the deathpenalty for 16-year-olds since "a majority of the States that permit capital punishment authorize" the practice). If the EighthAmendment represents anything other than a prohibition against
punishments that have been entirely abolished, a punishment onceuniversally practiced and then abandoned specifically due to its
inhumanity must qualify as cruel and unusual.In a 6-to-5 en banc opinion, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit disregarded this overwhelming evidence of state practice,holding that such evidence is relevant to consideration only of
the proportionality of a death sentence. Where the method ofexecution is contested, the majority reasoned, the Eighth Amendment prohibits only "the unnecessary and wanton infliction ofpain." App. to Pet. for Cert. A-20. Because hanging does not
inflict "purposeful cruelty," the method is constitutional. Id., atA-25. The Ninth Circuit's analysis is surprising given that this
Court never has held that pain is the exclusive considerationunder the Eighth Amendment, nor distinguished between challenges to the proportionality and the method of capital punish-ment. To the contrary, we have suggested that "[a] penalty must
also accord with `the dignity of man,' which is the `basic conceptunderlying the Eighth Amendment,' " Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S.
153, 173 (1976) ( joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens,JJ.), a suggestion supported by our recognition that painless, post
mortem punishments such as public display, drawing and quarter-ing, and mutilation also violate the Eighth Amendment. Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S. 130, 135-136 (1879).But the en banc panel's emphasis on pain also fails on its own
terms. Under the most "ideal" of circumstances, hanging killsby breaking the spine. "When the victim is dropped from a sufficient height his vertebrae are dislocated and his spinal cordcrushed; unconsciousness is immediate and death follows a short
time later." App. to Pet. for Cert. A-49 (Reinhardt, J., dissent511ord$$2w 11-03-97 16:36:53 PGT*ORDPP (Prelim. Print)

ing), quoting Gardner, Executions and Indignities--An EighthAmendment Assessment of Methods of Inflicting Capital Punishment, 39 Ohio St. L. J. 96, 120 (1978). Hanging, however, is acrude and imprecise practice, which always includes a risk that
the inmate will slowly strangulate or asphyxiate, if the rope istoo elastic or too short, or will be decapitated, if the rope is
too taut or too long. A veteran prison warden has described atypical hanging:

"When the trap springs he dangles at the end of the rope.There are times when the neck has not been broken and the
prisoner strangles to death. His eyes pop almost out of hishead, his tongue swells and protrudes from his mouth, his
neck may be broken, and the rope many times takes largeportions of skin and flesh from the side of the face that the
noose is on. He urinates, he defecates, and droppings fall tothe floor while witnesses look on." App. to Pet. for Cert.
A-57 (Reinhardt, J., dissenting), quoting Gardner, 39 Ohio St.L. J., at 121.

A person who slowly asphyxiates or strangulates while twistingat the end of a rope unquestionably experiences the most torturous and "wanton infliction of pain," Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S.,at 173 ( joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and

Stevens, JJ.), whilepartial or complete decapitation of the person, as blood sprays

uncontrollably, obviously violates human dignity.Washington contends that by conducting its hangings pursuant
to its Field Instruction WSP 410.500 or "protocol," these misfor-tunes can be reduced. Washington's protocol details the appropriate placement of the noose knot and the width and length ofthe rope to avoid decapitation, and provides that the rope be
boiled, stretched, and waxed to reduce asphyxiation. The proto-col includes a chart for determining, based on the weight of the
defendant, the appropriate distance the body should be dropped.Washington relies entirely on this protocol in conducting its judicial hangings; the State employs no "trained hangers," nor, appar-ently, are there any persons so trained in the United States.
App. to Pet. for Cert. A-26.The Ninth Circuit relied on this protocol and the State's own
evidence from its sole recent hanging to find only a "slight risk"that death by hanging will not be rapid or comparatively painless.
Id., at A-25. Washington's protocol, however, is derived almost

verbatim from a 1959 military execution manual that never hasbeen used in any hanging, and that is almost indistinguishable
from hanging procedures that resulted in torturous deaths andmutilations in the past. See id., at A-50, and n. 31 (Reinhardt,
J., dissenting). Experts for both parties who testified before theDistrict Court agreed that hanging always includes a risk that
unconsciousness and death will not be instantaneous, and ad-mitted that a certain number of Washington's hangings inevitably
will result in death by decapitation. The State presented no evi-dence that Washington's protocol will significantly reduce the risk
of asphyxiation or decapitation, and Campbell introduced unre-futed testimony that the protocol actually may increase the likelihood that an inmate's head will be torn off. The evidence in therecord is uncontested, therefore, that Washington's hangings will
suffer the inevitable failings that led all but one other State toabandon hanging as a means of execution.

I do not dispute that petitioner's crime was horrible or that hispunishment should be severe. It is equally irrefutable, however,
that the Constitution prohibits the imposition of punishments thatare offensive to civilized society. Forty-six of the forty-eight
States that once imposed hanging have rejected that punishmentas unnecessarily torturous, brutal, and inhumane. I can only conclude that today in the United States of America, hanging is crueland unusual punishment. I dissent.

No. 93-9278 (A-977). Nethery v. Texas. Ct. Crim. App.Tex. Application for stay of execution of sentence of death, presented to Justice Scalia, and by him referred to the Court,denied. Certiorari denied.

Justice Blackmun, dissenting.
Adhering to my view that the death penalty cannot be imposedfairly within the constraints of our Constitution, see my dissent

in Callins v. Collins, 510 U. S. 1141, 1143 (1994), I would grantthe application for stay of execution and the petition for certiorari
and would vacate the death sentence in this case.

Reported below: 862 S. W. 2d 297.

Justice O'Connor, dissenting.
Each year, Downtown Frankfort, Inc. (DFI), a nonprofit corpo-ration established to promote downtown revitalization in Frankfort, Kentucky, organizes a 1-day "Great Pumpkin Festival" onthe city's St. Clair Mall. Capital Area Right to Life, Inc.
(CARTL), had a booth at the 1989 festival, where it, among otherthings, distributed plastic models of fetuses in little baskets.
When many festivalgoers objected to this sort of political advo-cacy at the festival, DFI adopted a policy of denying booths to
organizations that it deemed incompatible with the festival's goalsof "fun and entertainment." Under this policy, DFI refused to
give CARTL a booth at the 1990 festival; DFI's president explic-itly told CARTL representatives that this was because CARTL
was a "controversial group." DFI also denied booths to Ken-tucky NOW and the Kentucky Religious Coalition for Abortion
Rights, two political groups with a message opposed to that ofCARTL. 862 S. W. 2d 297, 297-298 (Ky. 1993).

CARTL sued, claiming the policy violated its free speech rights.The Kentucky Supreme Court disagreed. It concluded DFI was

a state actor, and thus subject to the strictures of the FirstAmendment, because (1) DFI is principally funded by state agencies, (2) DFI took over from the city the function of promotingdowntown revitalization, and (3) the city temporarily delegated
to DFI control over the St. Clair Mall by letting DFI conduct thefestival and decide who gets booths. Id., at 299-300. But the
court went on to hold that the festival's policy was nonetheless"content neutral," and therefore a valid time, place, and manner
restriction. Id., at 300-301. The court interpreted the content-neutrality requirement as meaning that the restriction must be
"neutral as to the type of message the restriction permits as wellas being nondiscriminatory between messages of the same type,
so long as there is a logical and legitimate reason for restrictingthe type of message." Id., at 301. "It is a critical fact in this
case," the court said, "that CARTL's counterparts, NOW and theReligious Coalition for Abortion Rights, were also denied booths
in keeping with the festival's theme." Ibid.This content-neutrality analysis is flatly inconsistent with our
precedents. The restriction here is clearly not content neutral,and therefore cannot be a permissible time, place, and manner
restriction, because it is indisputably justified with reference tothe controversial content of the speech. See, e. g., Boos v. Barry,
485 U. S. 312, 321 (1988). The fact that prochoice speakers weretreated similarly under this regulation does not dispose of the
content-neutrality analysis; we have time and again rejected theargument that viewpoint neutrality equals content neutrality.
See, e. g., Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 197 (1992); Boos,supra, at 319; Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481
U. S. 221, 230 (1987); Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. PublicServ. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 530, 537-538 (1980); Carey v.
Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 462, n. 6 (1980).In fact, Heffron v. International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., 452 U. S. 640 (1981), the case on which the opinionbelow relied, specifically said that, to be a valid time, place, and
manner restriction, a regulation " `may not be based upon eitherthe content or subject matter of speech,' " id., at 648 (emphasis
added). Perhaps there is some other reason why the restrictionmight be permissible; but to call it content neutral and to uphold
it on that basis is a serious error and an unfortunate precedent.I also think the Kentucky Supreme Court's state action analysis
raises an important and difficult question. Many private organi511ord$$3x 11-03-97 16:42:49 PGT*ORDPP (Prelim. Print)

zations--artists' groups, private hospitals, private universities, or-ganizations that educate the public on social matters, Presidential
campaigns--get government subsidies. We have made clear thata state subsidy of a private organization, even a private organization that exercises functions which might otherwise be performedby the State, does not make that organization a state actor for
First Amendment purposes. Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U. S.830, 840-843 (1982) (dealing with a First Amendment claim based
on the discharge of an employee by a private school for malad-justed high school students). That this case also involves the use
of a traditional public forum probably should not change the anal-ysis. Many of the groups mentioned above may put on events in
public fora, and it is not clear that they should have any less rightto exclude people from their events than any other public forum
user would have to exclude others from its rally or parade.We have recently granted certiorari in Lebron v. National
Railroad Passenger Corporation, 511 U. S. 1105 (1994), to resolvea related state action question. While we cannot now tell to
what extent the decision in Lebron may bear on this case, I wouldhold this case pending that decision, and then either grant and
remand in light of Lebron, or, if Lebron proves irrelevant, grantand summarily reverse on the content-neutrality point. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the denial of the petition for awrit of certiorari.

June 6, 1994 511 U. S.
No. 93-1338. J. Alexander Securities, Inc. v. Mendez.Ct. App. Cal., 2d App. Dist. Certiorari denied. Reported below:
17 Cal. App. 4th 1083, 21 Cal. Rptr. 2d 826.

Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justice joins,dissenting.

Petitioner is a Los Angeles brokerage firm. When respondentopened an account there, she executed an agreement providing
for arbitration of all disputes. See 17 Cal. App. 4th 1083, 1087,n. 2, 21 Cal. Rptr. 2d 826, 828, n. 2 (1993). The contract also
provided that " `[t]his agreement and its enforcement shall be gov-erned by the laws of the State of New York.' " Id., at 1087, 21
Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 827. In 1991, respondent alleged that petitionerand one of its employees had engaged in various deceptive practices, resulting in financial losses to respondent. The parties sub-mitted the dispute to a panel of three arbitrators convened in
accordance with the rules of the National Association of SecuritiesDealers (NASD). The panel awarded respondent $27,000 in compensatory damages and $27,000 in punitive damages for petition-er's failure to adequately supervise the employee. Id., at 1087-
1088, 21 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at 828.Petitioner sought to have the punitive damages portion of the
award set aside, arguing that New York law prohibits arbitratorsfrom awarding punitive damages. See Garrity v. Lyle Stuart,
Inc., 40 N. Y. 2d 354, 353 N. E. 2d 793 (1976). The trial courtdeclined to correct the award. Relying on the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U. S. C. $ 2 et seq. (1988 ed. and Supp. IV), the Califor-nia Court of Appeal affirmed. The court concluded that "[t]he
choice of law provision [in the contract] merely designates thesubstantive law that the arbitrators must apply in determining
whether the conduct of the parties warrants an award of punitivedamages; it does not deprive the arbitrators of their authority to
award punitive damages." 17 Cal. App. 4th, at 1091, 21 Cal.Rptr. 2d, at 830.

The decision below is in accord with several federal decisionsholding that the Arbitration Act pre-empts state law prohibitions
on arbitral punitive damages awards. See, e. g., Todd ShipyardsCorp. v. Cunard Line, Ltd., 943 F. 2d 1056 (CA9 1991); Bonar v.
Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 835 F. 2d 1378 (CA11 1988). Butthe Court of Appeal expressly "decline[d] to follow two Second
Circuit cases, which held . . . that state law relating to the propri511ord$$3y 11-03-97 16:42:49 PGT*ORDPP (Prelim. Print)

1151ORDERS
O'Connor, J., dissenting1150
ety of a punitive damages award by an arbitrator is not pre-empted by federal substantive law, and thus vacated the punitive
damage[s] award." 17 Cal. App. 4th, at 1091, n. 7, 21 Cal.Rptr. 2d, at 830, n. 7, citing Barbier v. Shearson Lehman Hutton,
Inc., 948 F. 2d 117 (CA2 1991), and Fahnestock & Co. v. Waltman,935 F. 2d 512 (CA2 1991).

Moreover, the decision below irreconcilably conflicts with Mas-trobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 20 F. 3d 713 (CA7
1994). In Mastrobuono, the investor signed an agreement withthe brokerage house containing an arbitration provision and a
New York choice-of-law clause identical to those in the agreementin this case. The investor brought the same kinds of claims as
respondent did--churning and unauthorized trading--and theywere submitted to arbitration pursuant to NASD rules. The arbitration panel awarded punitive damages against the brokeragefirm, but the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that
the award should be set aside. See 9 U. S. C. $ 10(a)(4) (1988 ed.,Supp. IV) (authorizing set-aside where "the arbitrators exceeded
their powers"). The court acknowledged the strong federal policyfavoring arbitration, but also noted that the policy "is simply
to ensure the enforceability, according to their terms, of privateagreements to arbitrate." Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v.
Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S.468, 476 (1989) (emphasis added). By incorporating New York
law into the agreement, the court reasoned, the parties agreed tobe bound by the New York prohibition on arbitrators' awarding
punitive damages. The Seventh Circuit expressly "recognize[d]that some circuit courts have reached a different result." 20 F.
3d, at 718, citing Bonar v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., supra;Raytheon Co. v. Automated Business Systems, Inc., 882 F. 2d 6
(CA1 1989); Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Cunard Line, Ltd., supra;Lee v. Chica, 983 F. 2d 883 (CA8), cert. denied, 510 U. S. 906
(1993).To this list of conflicting decisions may be added the decision
below. The result is that courts in different jurisdictions reachcontrary results with respect to the availability of punitive
damages in cases involving similarly situated parties and iden-tical arbitration agreements. The Federal Arbitration Act was
passed, in part, to prevent this kind of disarray. Because mostsecurities agreements contain arbitration provisions, and many
are governed by New York law, the ability of arbitrators to award

(3) for a new trial under Rule 9023; or
(4) for relief under Rule 9024 if the motion is filed no

of the above motions is ineffective to appeal from the
judgment, order, or decree, or part thereof, specified in

2. Firearms possession--Convicted felon--Restoration of state civil
rights.--A person with a federal felony conviction who has had his civil

firearm, including a machinegun--Government should have been required

Frivolous appeal--Employment discrimination claim.--If only basis
for Court of Appeals' order sanctioning on petitioner's attorney for filing
a frivolous appeal in petitioner's employment discrimination case was that
his retroactivity argument was foreclosed by Circuit precedent, order was
not proper, since this Court had not yet ruled on disputed question
whether $ 101 of Civil Rights Act of 1991 applied retroactively to cases
arising before its enactment. McKnight v. General Motors Corp., p. 659.
