to Parts I, III, and IV, concluding that:1. A state law requirement that directly, substantially, and specificallyregulates occupational safety and health is an occupational safety andhealth standard within the meaning of the OSH Act regardless ofwhether it has another, nonoccupational purpose. In assessing a statelaw's impact on the federal scheme, this Court has refused to rely solely505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:25 PAGES OPINPGT89Cite as: 505 U. S. 88 (1992)Syllabuson the legislature's professed purpose and has looked as well to the law'seffects. See, e. g., Perez v. Campbell, 402 U. S. 637, 651-652. Statelaws of general applicability, such as traffic and fire safety laws, wouldgenerally not be pre-empted, because they regulate workers simply asmembers of the general public. Pp. 104-108.2. The state licensing acts are pre-empted by the OSH Act to theextent that they establish occupational safety and health standards fortraining those who work with hazardous wastes. The Act's saving provisions are not implicated and Illinois does not have an approved plan.Illinois' interest in establishing standards for licensing various occupations, cf., e. g., Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U. S. 773, 792, cannotsave from OSH Act pre-emption those provisions that directly and substantially affect workplace safety, since any state law, however clearlywithin a State's acknowledged power, must yield if it interferes with oris contrary to federal law, Felder v. Casey, 487 U. S. 131, 138. Nor canthe acts be saved from pre-emption by Gade's argument that they regulate a "pre-condition" to employment rather than occupational safetyand health, since SARA makes clear that the training of employees engaged in hazardous waste operations is an occupational safety and healthissue and that certification requirements before an employee may engage in such work are occupational safety and health standards. ThisCourt does not specifically consider which of the licensing acts' provisions will be pre-empted under the foregoing analysis. Pp. 108-109.Justice O'Connor, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice White,and Justice Scalia, concluded in Part II that the OSH Act impliedlypre-empts any state regulation of an occupational safety or health issuewith respect to which a federal standard has been established, unless astate plan has been submitted and approved pursuant to $ 18(b) of theAct. The Act as a whole demonstrates that Congress intended to promote occupational safety and health while avoiding subjecting workersand employers to duplicative regulation. Thus, it established a systemof uniform federal standards, but gave States the option of pre-emptingthe federal regulations entirely pursuant to an approved state plan thatdisplaces the federal standards. This intent is indicated principally in$ 18(b)'s statement that a State "shall" submit a plan if it wishes to"assume responsibility" for developing and enforcing health and safetystandards. Gade's interpretation of $ 18(b)--that the Secretary's approval is required only if a State wishes to replace, not merely supplement, the federal regulations--would be inconsistent with the federalscheme and is untenable in light of the surrounding provisions. Thelanguage and purposes of $$ 18(a), (c), (f), and (h) all confirm the viewthat the States cannot assume an enforcement role without the Secretary's approval, unless no federal standard is in effect. Also unaccept505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:25 PAGES OPINPGT90 GADE v. NATIONAL SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSN.Syllabusable is Gade's argument that the OSH Act does not pre-empt nonconflicting state laws because those laws, like the Act, are designed topromote worker safety. Even where such laws share a common goal, astate law will be pre-empted if it interferes with the methods by whicha federal statute was intended to reach that goal. International PaperCo. v. Ouellette, 479 U. S. 481, 494. Here, the Act does not foreclose aState from enacting its own laws, but it does restrict the ways in whichit can do so. Pp. 96-104.Justice Kennedy, agreeing that the state laws are pre-empted, concluded that the result is mandated by the express terms of $ 18(b) of theOSH Act and that the scope of pre-emption is also defined by the statutory text. Such a finding is not contrary to the longstanding rule thatthis Court will not infer pre-emption of the States' historic police powers absent a clear statement of intent by Congress. Unartful though$ 18(b)'s language may be, its structure and language, in conjunctionwith subsections (a), (c), and (f), leave little doubt that in the OSH ActCongress intended to pre-empt supplementary state regulation of anoccupational safety and health issue with respect to which a federalstandard exists.

NATIONAL SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSN.Opinion of the CourtIThe OSH Act authorizes the Secretary of Labor to promul-gate federal occupational safety and health standards. 29U. S. C. $ 655. In the Superfund Amendments and Reau-thorization Act of 1986 (SARA), Congress directed the Secretary of Labor to "promulgate standards for the health andsafety protection of employees engaged in hazardous wasteoperations" pursuant to her authority under the OSH Act.SARA, Pub. L. 99-499, Title I, $ 126, 100 Stat. 1690-1692,codified at note following 29 U. S. C. $ 655. In relevant part,SARA requires the Secretary to establish standards for theinitial and routine training of workers who handle hazard-ous wastes.In response to this congressional directive, OSHA, towhich the Secretary has delegated certain of her statutoryresponsibilities, see Martin v. Occupational Safety andHealth Review Comm'n, 499 U. S. 144, 147, n. 1 (1991), pro-mulgated regulations on "Hazardous Waste Operations andEmergency Response," including detailed regulations onworker training requirements. 51 Fed. Reg. 45654, 45665-45666 (1986) (interim regulations); 54 Fed. Reg. 9294, 9320-9321 (1989) (final regulations), codified at 29 CFR $ 1910.120(1991). The OSHA regulations require, among other things,that workers engaged in an activity that may expose themto hazardous wastes receive a minimum of 40 hours of in-struction off the site, and a minimum of three days actualfield experience under the supervision of a trained supervi-sor. $ 1910.120(e)(3)(i).

Those who have satisfied the train-ing and field experience requirement receive a written certification; uncertified workers are prohibited from engaging inhazardous waste operations. $ 1910.120(e)(6).In 1988, while OSHA's interim hazardous waste regulations were in effect, the State of Illinois enacted the licensingacts at issue here. The laws are designated as acts "in relation to environmental protection," and their stated aim is toprotect both employees and the general public by licensinghazardous waste equipment operators and laborers workingat certain facilities. Both licensing acts require a licenseapplicant to provide a certified record of at least 40 hoursof training under an approved program conducted withinIllinois, to pass a written examination, and to complete anannual refresher course of at least eight hours of instruction. Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 111, |||| 7705(c) and (e), 7706(c) and(d), 7707(b), 7805(c) and (e), 7806(b). In addition, applicantsfor a hazardous waste crane operator's license must submit"a certified record showing operation of equipment used inhazardous waste handling for a minimum of 4,000 hours."|| 7705(d). Employees who work without the proper license,and employers who knowingly permit an unlicensed employee to work, are subject to escalating fines for eachoffense. |||| 7715, 7716, 7814.The respondent in this case, National Solid Wastes Management Association (Association), is a national trade association of businesses that remove, transport, dispose, andhandle waste material, including hazardous waste. The Association's members are subject to the OSH Act and OSHAregulations, and are therefore required to train, qualify, andcertify their hazardous waste remediation workers. 29CFR $ 1910.120 (1991). For hazardous waste operationsconducted in Illinois, certain of the workers employed by theAssociation's members are also required to obtain licenses505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:25 PAGES OPINPGT94 GADE v. NATIONAL SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSN.Opinion of the Courtpursuant to the Illinois licensing acts. Thus, for example,some of the Association's members must ensure that theiremployees receive not only the 3 days of field experiencerequired for certification under the OSHA regulations, butalso the 500 days of experience (4,000 hours) required forlicensing under the state statutes.Shortly before the state licensing acts were due to go intoeffect, the Association brought a declaratory judgment ac-tion in United States District Court against Bernard Killian,the former Director of the Illinois Environmental ProtectionAgency (IEPA); petitioner Mary Gade is Killian's successorin office and has been substituted as a party pursuant to thisCourt's Rule 35.3. The Association sought to enjoin IEPAfrom enforcing the Illinois licensing acts, claiming that theacts were pre-empted by the OSH Act and OSHA regulations and that they violated the Commerce Clause of theUnited States Constitution. The District Court held thatstate laws that attempt to regulate workplace safety andhealth are not pre-empted by the OSH Act when the lawshave a "legitimate and substantial purpose apart from promoting job safety." App. to Pet. for Cert. 54. Applyingthis standard, the District Court held that the Illinois licensing acts were not pre-empted because each protected publicsafety in addition to promoting job safety. Id., at 56-57.The court indicated that it would uphold a state regulationimplementing the 4,000-hour experience requirement, as longas it did not conflict with federal regulations, because it wasreasonable to conclude that workers who satisfy the requirement "will be better skilled than those who do not; and better skilled means fewer accidents, which equals less risk topublic safety and the environment." Id., at 59. At thesame time, the District Court invalidated the requirementthat applicants for a hazardous waste license be trained"within Illinois" on the ground that the provision did notcontribute to Illinois' stated purpose of protecting publicsafety. Id., at 57-58. The court declined to consider the505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:25 PAGES OPINPGT95Cite as: 505 U. S. 88 (1992)Opinion of the CourtAssociation's Commerce Clause challenge for lack of ripeness. Id., at 61-62.On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for theSeventh Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. National Solid Wastes Management Assn. v. Killian, 918 F. 2d671 (1990). The Court of Appeals held that the OSH Actpre-empts all state law that "constitutes, in a direct, clearand substantial way, regulation of worker health and safety,"unless the Secretary has explicitly approved the state law.Id., at 679. Because many of the regulations mandated bythe Illinois licensing acts had not yet reached their finalform, the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the DistrictCourt without considering which, if any, of the Illinois provisions would be pre-empted. Id., at 684. The court madeclear, however, its view that Illinois "cannot regulate workerhealth and safety under the guise of environmental regulation," and it rejected the District Court's conclusion that theState's 4,000-hour experience requirement could survive preemption simply because the rule might also enhance publichealth and safety. Ibid. Writing separately, Judge Easterbrook expressed doubt that the OSH Act pre-empts nonconflicting state laws. Id., at 685-688. He concluded, however, that if the OSH Act does pre-empt state law, themajority had employed an appropriate test for determiningwhether the Illinois licensing acts were superseded. Id.,at 688.We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 1012 (1991), to resolve aconflict between the decision below and decisions in whichother Courts of Appeals have found the OSH Act to havea much narrower pre-emptive effect on "dual impact" stateregulations.

Hughey, 774 F. 2d 587,593 (CA3 1985).IIBefore addressing the scope of the OSH Act's pre-emptionof dual impact state regulations, we consider petitioner'sthreshold argument, drawn from Judge Easterbrook's sepa-rate opinion below, that the Act does not pre-empt nonconflicting state regulations at all. "[T]he question whether acertain state action is pre-empted by federal law is one ofcongressional intent. ` "The purpose of Congress is the ul-timate touchstone." ' " Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471U. S. 202, 208 (1985) (quoting Malone v. White Motor Corp.,435 U. S. 497, 504 (1978)). "To discern Congress' intent weexamine the explicit statutory language and the structureand purpose of the statute." Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U. S. 133, 138 (1990); see also FMC Corp. v. Holliday, 498 U. S. 52, 56-57 (1990).In the OSH Act, Congress endeavored "to assure so far aspossible every working man and woman in the Nation safeand healthful working conditions." 29 U. S. C. $ 651(b). Tothat end, Congress authorized the Secretary of Labor to setmandatory occupational safety and health standards applicable to all businesses affecting interstate commerce, 29U. S. C. $ 651(b)(3), and thereby brought the Federal Government into a field that traditionally had been occupied by theStates. Federal regulation of the workplace was not intended to be all encompassing, however. First, Congressexpressly saved two areas from federal pre-emption. Section 4(b)(4) of the OSH Act states that the Act does not "su-persede or in any manner affect any workmen's compensation law or . . . enlarge or diminish or affect in any othermanner the common law or statutory rights, duties, or liabilities of employers and employees under any law with respectto injuries, diseases, or death of employees arising out of, orin the course of, employment." 29 U. S. C. $ 653(b)(4). Sec-tion 18(a) provides that the Act does not "prevent any State505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:25 PAGES OPINPGT97Cite as: 505 U.

S. C. $ 667(a).Congress not only reserved certain areas to state regulation, but it also, in $ 18(b) of the Act, gave the States theoption of pre-empting federal regulation entirely. That section provides:"Submission of State plan for development and enforce-ment of State standards to preempt applicable Federalstandards."Any State which, at any time, desires to assume responsibility for development and enforcement therein ofoccupational safety and health standards relating to anyoccupational safety or health issue with respect to whicha Federal standard has been promulgated [by the Secretary under the OSH Act] shall submit a State plan forthe development of such standards and their enforcement." 29 U. S. C. $ 667(b).About half the States have received the Secretary's approvalfor their own state plans as described in this provision. 29CFR pts. 1952, 1956 (1991). Illinois is not among them.In the decision below, the Court of Appeals held that$ 18(b) "unquestionably" pre-empts any state law or reg-ulation that establishes an occupational health and safetystandard on an issue for which OSHA has already pro-mulgated a standard, unless the State has obtained theSecretary's approval for its own plan. 918 F. 2d, at 677.Every other federal and state court confronted with an OSHAct pre-emption challenge has reached the same conclusion,1and so do we.1 E. g., Associated Industries of Massachusetts v.

Absent explicit pre-emptive language,we have recognized at least two types of implied pre-emption: field pre-emption, where the scheme of federal regulation is " `so pervasive as to make reasonable the inferencethat Congress left no room for the States to supplement it,' "id., at 153 (quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S.218, 230 (1947)), and conflict pre-emption, where "compliancewith both federal and state regulations is a physical impossi-bility,"Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373U. S. 132, 142-143 (1963), or where state law "stands as anobstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full pur-poses and objectives of Congress," Hines v. Davidowitz, 312U.

S. 88 (1992)Opinion of O'Connor, J.sues for which a federal standard is in effect is impliedly pre-empted as in conflict with the full purposes and objectives ofthe OSH Act, Hines v. Davidowitz, supra. The design ofthe statute persuades us that Congress intended to subjectemployers and employees to only one set of regulations, beit federal or state, and that the only way a State may regu-late an OSHA-regulated occupational safety and health issueis pursuant to an approved state plan that displaces the fed-eral standards.The principal indication that Congress intended to pre-empt state law is $ 18(b)'s statement that a State "shall" submit a plan if it wishes to "assume responsibility" for "development and enforcement . . . of occupational safety andhealth standards relating to any occupational safety orhealth issue with respect to which a Federal standard hasbeen promulgated." The unavoidable implication of thisprovision is that a State may not enforce its own occupationalsafety and health standards without obtaining the Secretary's approval, and petitioner concedes that $ 18(b) wouldrequire an approved plan if Illinois wanted to "assume responsibility" for the regulation of occupational safety andhealth within the State. Petitioner contends, however, thatan approved plan is necessary only if the State wishes completely to replace the federal regulations, not merely to supplement them. She argues that the correct interpretationof $ 18(b) is that posited by Judge Easterbrook below: i. e., aState may either "oust" the federal standard by submittinga state plan to the Secretary for approval or "add to" thefederal standard without seeking the Secretary's approval.918 F. 2d, at 685 (Easterbrook, J., dubitante).Petitioner's interpretation of $ 18(b) might be plausiblewere we to interpret that provision in isolation, but it simplyis not tenable in light of the OSH Act's surrounding provisions. "[W]e must not be guided by a single sentence ormember of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the wholelaw." Dedeaux, supra, at 51 (internal quotation marks and505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT100 GADE v. NATIONAL SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSN.Opinion of O'Connor, J.citations omitted). The OSH Act as a whole evidences Con-gress' intent to avoid subjecting workers and employers toduplicative regulation; a State may develop an occupationalsafety and health program tailored to its own needs, but onlyif it is willing completely to displace the applicable federalregulations.Cutting against petitioner's interpretation of $ 18(b) is thelanguage of $ 18(a), which saves from pre-emption any statelaw regulating an occupational safety and health issue withrespect to which no federal standard is in effect. 29 U. S. C.$ 667(a). Although this is a saving clause, not a pre-emptionclause, the natural implication of this provision is that statelaws regulating the same issue as federal laws are not saved,even if they merely supplement the federal standard. Moreover, if petitioner's reading of $ 18(b) were correct, and ifa State were free to enact nonconflicting safety and healthregulations, then $ 18(a) would be superfluous: There is nopossibility of conflict where there is no federal regulation.Because "[i]t is our duty `to give effect, if possible, to everyclause and word of a statute,' " United States v. Menasche,348 U. S. 528, 538-539 (1955) (quoting Montclair v. Ramsdell,107 U. S. 147, 152 (1883)), we conclude that $ 18(a)'s preservation of state authority in the absence of a federal standardpresupposes a background pre-emption of all state occupational safety and health standards whenever a federal standard governing the same issue is in effect.Our understanding of the implications of $ 18(b) is likewisebolstered by $ 18(c) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. $ 667(c), which setsforth the conditions that must be satisfied before the Secretary can approve a plan submitted by a State under subsection (b). State standards that affect interstate commercewill be approved only if they "are required by compellinglocal conditions" and "do not unduly burden interstate commerce." $ 667(c)(2). If a State could supplement federalregulations without undergoing the $ 18(b) approval process,then the protections that $ 18(c) offers to interstate com505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT101Cite as: 505 U. S. 88 (1992)Opinion of O'Connor, J.merce would easily be undercut. It would make little senseto impose such a condition on state programs intended tosupplant federal regulation and not those that merely supple-ment it: The burden on interstate commerce remains thesame.Section 18(f ) also confirms our view that States are notpermitted to assume an enforcement role without the Secretary's approval, unless no federal standard is in effect. Thatprovision gives the Secretary the authority to withdraw herapproval of a state plan. 29 U. S. C. $ 667(f ). Once ap-proval is withdrawn, the plan "cease[s] to be in effect" andthe State is permitted to assert jurisdiction under its occupational health and safety law only for those cases "commencedbefore the withdrawal of the plan." Ibid. Under petitioner's reading of $ 18(b), $ 18(f) should permit the continuedexercise of state jurisdiction over purely "supplemental" andnonconflicting standards. Instead, $ 18(f) assumes that theState loses the power to enforce all of its occupational safetyand health standards once approval is withdrawn.The same assumption of exclusive federal jurisdiction inthe absence of an approved state plan is apparent in thetransitional provisions contained in $ 18(h) of the Act. 29U. S. C. $ 667(h). Section 18(h) authorized the Secretary ofLabor, during the first two years after passage of the Act,to enter into an agreement with a State by which the Statewould be permitted to continue to enforce its own occupational health and safety standards for two years or until finalaction was taken by the Secretary pursuant to $ 18(b), whichever was earlier. Significantly, $ 18(h) does not say thatsuch an agreement is only necessary when the State wishesfully to supplant federal standards. Indeed, the originalSenate version of the provision would have allowed a Stateto enter into such an agreement only when it wished to enforce standards "not in conflict with Federal occupationalhealth and safety standards," a category which included "anyState occupational health and safety standard which pro505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT102 GADE v. NATIONAL SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSN.Opinion of O'Connor, J.vides for more stringent health and safety regulations thando the Federal standards." S. 2193, $ 17(h), reprinted in 116Cong. Rec. 37637 (1970). Although that provision was elimi-nated from the final draft of the bill, thereby allowing agreements for the temporary enforcement of less stringent statestandards, it is indicative of the congressional understandingthat a State was required to enter into a transitional agreement even when its standards were stricter than federalstandards. The Secretary's contemporaneous interpretation of $ 18(h) also expresses that understanding. See 29CFR $ 1901.2 (1972) ("Section 18(h) permits the Secretary toprovide an alternative to the exclusive Federal jurisdiction[over] occupational safety and health issue[s]. This alternative is temporary and may be considered a step toward themore permanent alternative to exclusive Federal jurisdiction provided by sections 18(b) and (c) following submissionand approval of a plan submitted by a State for the development and enforcement of occupational safety and healthstandards") (emphases added).Looking at the provisions of $ 18 as a whole, we concludethat the OSH Act precludes any state regulation of an occupational safety or health issue with respect to which a federal standard has been established, unless a state plan hasbeen submitted and approved pursuant to $ 18(b). Our review of the Act persuades us that Congress sought to promote occupational safety and health while at the same timeavoiding duplicative, and possibly counterproductive, regulation. It thus established a system of uniform federal occupational health and safety standards, but gave States theoption of pre-empting federal regulations by developing theirown occupational safety and health programs. In addition,Congress offered the States substantial federal grant moneysto assist them in developing their own programs. See OSHAct $ 23, 29 U. S. C. $$ 672(a), (b), and (f) (for three yearsfollowing enactment, the Secretary may award up to 90% ofthe costs to a State of developing a state occupational safety505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT103Cite as: 505 U. S. 88 (1992)Opinion of O'Connor, J.and health plan); 29 U. S. C. $ 672(g) (States that develop approved plans may receive funding for up to 50% of the costsof operating their occupational health and safety programs).To allow a State selectively to "supplement" certain federalregulations with ostensibly nonconflicting standards wouldbe inconsistent with this federal scheme of establishing uniform federal standards, on the one hand, and encouragingStates to assume full responsibility for development and enforcement of their own OSH programs, on the other.We cannot accept petitioner's argument that the OSH Actdoes not pre-empt nonconflicting state laws because thoselaws, like the Act, are designed to promote worker safety.In determining whether state law "stands as an obstacle" tothe full implementation of a federal law, Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S., at 67, "it is not enough to say that the ultimate goal of both federal and state law" is the same, International Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 479 U. S. 481, 494 (1987)."A state law also is pre-empted if it interferes with the methods by which the federal statute was designed to reach th[at]goal." Ibid.; see also Michigan Canners & Freezers Assn.,Inc. v. Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Bd., 467U. S. 461, 477 (1984) (state statute establishing association torepresent agricultural producers pre-empted even though itand the federal Agricultural Fair Practices Act "share thegoal of augmenting the producer's bargaining power"); Wisconsin Dept. of Industry v. Gould Inc., 475 U. S. 282, 286-287(1986) (state statute preventing three-time violators of theNational Labor Relations Act from doing business with theState is pre-empted even though state law was designed toreinforce requirements of federal Act). The OSH Act doesnot foreclose a State from enacting its own laws to advancethe goal of worker safety, but it does restrict the ways inwhich it can do so. If a State wishes to regulate an issue ofworker safety for which a federal standard is in effect, its505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT104 GADE v. NATIONAL SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSN.Opinion of the Courtonly option is to obtain the prior approval of the Secretaryof Labor, as described in $ 18 of the Act.2IIIPetitioner next argues that, even if Congress intended topre-empt all nonapproved state occupational safety andhealth regulations whenever a federal standard is in effect,the OSH Act's pre-emptive effect should not be extended tostate laws that address public safety as well as occupationalsafety concerns. As we explained in Part II, we understand2 Justice Kennedy, while agreeing on the pre-emptive scope of theOSH Act, finds that its pre-emption is express rather than implied. Post,at 112 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).The Court's previous observation that our pre-emption categories are not"rigidly distinct," English v. General Electric Co., 496 U. S. 72, 79, n. 5(1990), is proved true by this case. We, too, are persuaded that the textof the Act provides the strongest indication that Congress intended thepromulgation of a federal safety and health standard to pre-empt all nonapproved state regulation of the same issue, but we cannot say that itrises to the level of express pre-emption. In the end, even Justice Kennedy finds express pre-emption by relying on the negative "inference" of$ 18(b), which governs when state law will pre-empt federal law. Post, at112. We cannot agree that the negative implications of the text, althoughultimately dispositive to our own analysis, expressly address the issue offederal pre-emption of state law. We therefore prefer to place this casein the category of implied pre-emption. Supra, at 98-99. Although wehave chosen to use the term "conflict" pre-emption, we could as easilyhave stated that the promulgation of a federal safety and health standard"pre-empts the field" for any nonapproved state law regulating the samesafety and health issue. See English, supra, at 79-80, n. 5 ("[F]ield preemption may be understood as a species of conflict pre-emption: A statelaw that falls within a pre-empted field conflicts with Congress' intent(either express or plainly implied) to exclude state regulation"); post,at 116 (Souter, J., dissenting). Frequently, the pre-emptive "label" wechoose will carry with it substantive implications for the scope of preemption. In this case, however, it does not. Our disagreement with Justice Kennedy as to whether the OSH Act's pre-emptive effect is labeled"express" or "implied" is less important than our agreement that the implications of the text of the statute evince a congressional intent to preempt nonapproved state regulations when a federal standard is in effect.505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT105Cite as: 505 U. S. 88 (1992)Opinion of the Court$ 18(b) to mean that the OSH Act pre-empts all state "occu-pational safety and health standards relating to any occupational safety or health issue with respect to which a Federalstandard has been promulgated." 29 U. S. C. $ 667(b). Wenow consider whether a dual impact law can be an "occupa-tional safety and health standard" subject to pre-emptionunder the Act.The OSH Act defines an "occupational safety and healthstandard" as "a standard which requires conditions, or theadoption or use of one or more practices, means, methods,operations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appro-priate to provide safe or healthful employment and places ofemployment." 29 U. S. C. $ 652(8). Any state law require-ment designed to promote health and safety in the workplacefalls neatly within the Act's definition of an "occupationalsafety and health standard." Clearly, under this definition,a state law that expressly declares a legislative purpose ofregulating occupational health and safety would, in the absence of an approved state plan, be pre-empted by an OSHAstandard regulating the same subject matter. But petitioner asserts that if the state legislature articulates a pur-pose other than (or in addition to) workplace health andsafety, then the OSH Act loses its pre-emptive force. Wedisagree.Although "part of the pre-empted field is defined by refer-ence to the purpose of the state law in question, . . . anotherpart of the field is defined by the state law's actual effect."English v. General Electric Co., 496 U. S. 72, 84 (1990) (citingPacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources Conser-vation and Development Comm'n, 461 U. S. 190, 212-213(1983)). In assessing the impact of a state law on the federalscheme, we have refused to rely solely on the legislature'sprofessed purpose and have looked as well to the effects ofthe law. As we explained over two decades ago:"We can no longer adhere to the aberrational doctrine. . . that state law may frustrate the operation of federal505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT106 GADE v. NATIONAL SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSN.Opinion of the Courtlaw as long as the state legislature in passing its lawhad some purpose in mind other than one of frustration.Apart from the fact that it is at odds with the approachtaken in nearly all our Supremacy Clause cases, such adoctrine would enable state legislatures to nullify nearlyall unwanted federal legislation by simply publishing alegislative committee report articulating some state in-terest or policy--other than frustration of the federalobjective--that would be tangentially furthered by theproposed state law. . . . [A]ny state legislation whichfrustrates the full effectiveness of federal law is ren-dered invalid by the Supremacy Clause."Perez v.Campbell, 402 U. S., at 651-652.See also Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373U. S., at 141-142 (focus on "whether the purposes of the twolaws are parallel or divergent" tends to "obscure more thanaid" in determining whether state law is pre-empted by federal law) (emphasis deleted); Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U. S.322, 336 (1979) ("[W]hen considering the purpose of a challenged statute, this Court is not bound by `[t]he name, de-scription or characterization given it by the legislature orthe courts of the State,' but will determine for itself the prac-tical impact of the law") (quotingLacoste v. Department ofConservation of Louisiana, 263 U. S. 545, 550 (1924)); Na-pier v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 272 U. S. 605, 612 (1926)(pre-emption analysis turns not on whether federal and statelaws "are aimed at distinct and different evils" but whetherthey "operate upon the same object").Our precedents leave no doubt that a dual impact stateregulation cannot avoid OSH Act pre-emption simply be-cause the regulation serves several objectives rather thanone. As the Court of Appeals observed, "[i]t would defeatthe purpose of section 18 if a state could enact measuresstricter than OSHA's and largely accomplished through regu-lation of worker health and safety simply by asserting a nonoccupational purpose for the legislation." 918 F. 2d, at 679.505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT107Cite as: 505 U. S. 88 (1992)Opinion of the CourtWhatever the purpose or purposes of the state law, pre-emption analysis cannot ignore the effect of the challengedstate action on the pre-empted field. The key question isthus at what point the state regulation sufficiently interfereswith federal regulation that it should be deemed pre-emptedunder the Act.InEnglish v. General Electric Co., supra, we held that astate tort claim brought by an employee of a nuclear-fuelsproduction facility against her employer was not pre-emptedby a federal whistle-blower provision because the state lawdid not have a "direct and substantial effect" on the federalscheme. Id., at 85. In the decision below, the Court of Appeals relied on English to hold that, in the absence of theapproval of the Secretary, the OSH Act pre-empts all statelaw that "constitutes, in a direct, clear and substantial way,regulation of worker health and safety." 918 F. 2d, at 679.We agree that this is the appropriate standard for determining OSH Act pre-emption. On the other hand, state laws ofgeneral applicability (such as laws regarding traffic safety orfire safety) that do not conflict with OSHA standards andthat regulate the conduct of workers and nonworkers alikewould generally not be pre-empted. Although some laws ofgeneral applicability may have a "direct and substantial" effect on worker safety, they cannot fairly be characterizedas "occupational" standards, because they regulate workerssimply as members of the general public. In this case, weagree with the court below that a law directed at workplacesafety is not saved from pre-emption simply because theState can demonstrate some additional effect outside of theworkplace.In sum, a state law requirement that directly, substantially, and specifically regulates occupational safety andhealth is an occupational safety and health standard withinthe meaning of the Act. That such a law may also have anonoccupational impact does not render it any less of an occupational standard for purposes of pre-emption analysis.505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT108 GADE v. NATIONAL SOLID WASTES MANAGEMENT ASSN.Opinion of the CourtIf the State wishes to enact a dual impact law that regulatesan occupational safety or health issue for which a federalstandard is in effect, $ 18 of the Act requires that the Statesubmit a plan for the approval of the Secretary.IVWe recognize that "the States have a compelling interestin the practice of professions within their boundaries, andthat as part of their power to protect the public health,safety, and other valid interests they have broad power toestablish standards for licensing practitioners and regulatingthe practice of professions."Goldfarb v. Virginia StateBar, 421 U. S. 773, 792 (1975); see also Ferguson v. Skrupa,372 U. S. 726, 731 (1963); Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U. S.114, 122 (1889). But under the Supremacy Clause, fromwhich our pre-emption doctrine is derived, " `any state law,however clearly within a State's acknowledged power, whichinterferes with or is contrary to federal law, must yield.' "Felder v. Casey, 487 U. S., at 138 (quoting Free v. Bland, 369U. S. 663, 666 (1962)); see also De Canas v. Bica, 424 U. S.351, 357 (1976) ("[E]ven state regulation designed to protectvital state interests must give way to paramount federal legislation"). We therefore reject petitioner's argument thatthe State's interest in licensing various occupations can savefrom OSH Act pre-emption those provisions that directly andsubstantially affect workplace safety.We also reject petitioner's argument that the Illinois li-censing acts do not regulate occupational safety and healthat all, but are instead a "pre-condition" to employment. Bythat reasoning, the OSHA regulations themselves wouldnot be considered occupational standards. SARA, how-ever, makes clear that the training of employees engaged inhazardous waste operations is an occupational safety andhealth issue, and that certification requirements before anemployee may engage in such work are occupational safetyand health standards. See supra, at 92. Because nei505us1$97L 07-15-96 23:00:26 PAGES OPINPGT109Cite as: 505 U. S. 88 (1992)Opinion of Kennedy, J.ther of the OSH Act's saving provisions are implicated, andbecause Illinois does not have an approved state plan under$ 18(b), the state licensing acts are pre-empted by the OSHAct to the extent they establish occupational safety andhealth standards for training those who work with hazardouswastes. Like the Court of Appeals, we do not specificallyconsider which of the licensing acts' provisions will stand orfall under the pre-emption analysis set forth above.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is hereby
