The question in this case is whether the Supreme Court ofArizona has cured petitioner's death sentence of vaguenesserror. IOn August 25, 1973, Bernard Crummett had the misfor-tune to meet Rebecca Corella in a Tucson, Arizona, bar.Crummett left the bar with Corella and, in the parking lot,met petitioner, who had been waiting for Corella with hisgirlfriend, Faith Erwin. Corella agreed to perform an actof prostitution with Crummett, and petitioner drove thegroup to Corella's hotel. There, Corella communicated topetitioner that Crummett was "loaded," and petitioner inturn whispered to Erwin that he intended to rob Crummett.After Corella and Crummett concluded their encounter atthe hotel, the group again went for a drive, this time to adeserted area outside Tucson, where, Crummett believed,Corella would perform another act of prostitution. Peti-tioner stopped the car and got out. He first struck Crummett to the ground and next threw several large rocks atCrummett's head. Crummett's watch and wallet were506us1$$6J 08-22-96 16:50:05 PAGES OPINPGT42 RICHMOND v. LEWISOpinion of the Courttaken by Corella, petitioner, or both, and these two thendrove away with Erwin. Either petitioner or Corella wasdriving, and whoever it was drove the car over Crummetttwice. Crummett suffered injuries to his head and trunk,and died.The State of Arizona charged petitioner with robbery andfirst degree murder. Erwin testified at the jury trial thatpetitioner drove the car over Crummett, but admitted thatshe had been intoxicated by heroin at the time. A defensewitness stated that Erwin previously had identified Corellaas the driver. Neither Corella nor petitioner took the stand,although the prosecution did introduce a postarrest statement by petitioner in which he acknowledged robbing Crummett but claimed that Corella was the driver. There wasmedical testimony that a car had crushed Crummett's head,killing him, and that the injuries to his trunk, also vehicular,took place at least 30 seconds later.Petitioner was convicted of both robbery and first degreemurder. The jury was instructed as to the elements of felony murder as well as premeditated murder; the murder conviction was returned by a general verdict. Judge Roylstonheld the penalty hearing required by Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.$ 13-703 (1989), then codified as $ 13-454, and sentenced petitioner to death for the murder and 15-20 years' imprisonment for the robbery. The judge found two statutory aggravating factors: that petitioner had a prior felony convictioninvolving the use or threat of violence on another person,$ 13-703(F)(2) (an armed kidnaping), and that petitioner"committed the offense in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved manner," $ 13-703(F)(6) ((F)(6) factor). Specifically,Judge Roylston's written order stated that "the Defendantdid commit the offense in an especially heinous and cruelmanner." App. 44. There was no explicit finding about theidentity of the driver of the vehicle.Petitioner unsuccessfully sought postconviction relief inthe trial court, attaching two affidavits by persons who506us1$$6J 08-22-96 16:50:05 PAGES OPINPGT43Cite as: 506 U. S. 40 (1992)Opinion of the Courtclaimed to have been told by Corella that she, not petitioner,drove the car over Crummett. The Supreme Court of Arizona affirmed the sentence, conviction, and denial of postcon-viction relief.State v. Richmond, 114 Ariz. 186, 560 P. 2d41 (1976). Although the opinion is ambiguous on this point,it appears that the court did not reach petitioner's vaguenesschallenge to the "especially heinous, cruel or depraved" factor because his death sentence was supported by anothervalid aggravating factor and no statutory mitigating factorsapplied. Id., at 196-197, 560 P. 2d, at 51-52. We deniedcertiorari. 433 U. S. 915 (1977). Federal habeas corpusproceedings ensued, as a result of which petitioner's conviction was found valid but his sentence invalid becausethe sentencing judge had been constrained to consider a limited set of mitigating factors. Richmond v. Cardwell, 450F. Supp. 519 (Ariz. 1978). Soon thereafter, the SupremeCourt of Arizona held the Arizona death penalty statute unconstitutional insofar as it limited defendants to statutorymitigating factors, State v. Watson, 120 Ariz. 441, 444-445,586 P. 2d 1253, 1256-1257 (1978), and vacated every pendingArizona death sentence, see Brief for Respondents 5.Petitioner's resentencing took place in March 1980. Atthe hearing, one defense witness testified that Erwin hadidentified Corella as the driver, while another stated thatCorella had admitted the same. The defense also producedevidence of petitioner's rehabilitation in prison and of theeffect his execution would have on his family. Judge Roylston again sentenced petitioner to death, this time findingthree statutory aggravating circumstances: under Ariz. Rev.Stat. Ann. $ 13-703(F)(2) (prior violent felony) and $ 13-703(F)(6) ("especially heinous, cruel or depraved" offense), asbefore, and also under $ 13-703(F)(1) (prior felony meritinglife imprisonment), for a murder charge of which petitionerhad been convicted after the first sentencing even thoughthe murder predated Crummett's. Once again, the judgefound that "the Defendant did commit the offense in this case506us1$$6J 08-22-96 16:50:05 PAGES OPINPGT44 RICHMOND v. LEWISOpinion of the Courtin an especially heinous and cruel manner," App. 74, but didnot explicitly find that petitioner was the driver. The findings as to mitigation were, among others, that "Rebecca Corella was involved in the offense but was never charged withany crime"; that "Faith [E]rwin was involved in the offensebut was never charged with any crime"; that "the jury wasinstructed both on the matters relating to the felony murderrule, as well as matters relating to premeditated murder";and that "the Defendant's family . . . will suffer considerablegrief as a result of any death penalty that might be imposed."Id., at 75. The judge was unable to make a definitive findingas to rehabilitation and concluded that "there are no mitigating circumstances sufficiently substantial to call for leniency." Id., at 76.A divided Supreme Court of Arizona affirmed, with eachof the five justices joining one of three opinions. State v.Richmond, 136 Ariz. 312, 666 P. 2d 57 (1983) (Richmond II).Chief Justice Holohan wrote the principal opinion for himselfand for Justice Hays, rejecting various challenges to petitioner's sentence, including a challenge to the (F)(6) factor.He reasoned that petitioner's offense was "heinous" and "depraved" (but not "cruel") and that this factor was not unconstitutionally vague:"In [State v. Gretzler, 135 Ariz. 42, 659 P. 2d 1, cert.denied, 461 U. S. 971 (1983)], we discussed factors whichlead to a finding of heinousness or depravity. One factor is the infliction of gratuitous violence on the victim;another related factor is the needless mutilation of thevictim. Here the victim was already unconscious andbleeding when he was run over not once, but twice, eachtime from a different direction. The evidence indicatesthat the first run by the vehicle was over the victim'shead crushing his skull and killing him. The second runof the vehicle was over the body of the victim. . . . Againthe fact that the victim in the instant case was run over506us1$$6J 08-22-96 16:50:05 PAGES OPINPGT45Cite as: 506 U. S. 40 (1992)Opinion of the Courttwice and his skull was crushed, we find to be a ghastlymutilation of the victim." Id., at 319, 666 P. 2d, at 64.The principal opinion then conducted an independent reviewof the sentence, concluding that "the mitigation offered by[petitioner] is not sufficiently substantial to outweigh the[three] aggravating circumstances." Id., at 321, 666 P. 2d,at 66.Justice Cameron, joined by Vice Chief Justice Gordon,wrote a special concurrence. "I concur in the [principalopinion] except its finding that this crime was heinous anddepraved, and I concur in the result." Id., at 324, 666 P. 2d,at 69. The concurring justices contended that petitionercommitted neither "gratuitous violence" nor "needless muti-lation" within the meaning ofState v. Gretzler, 135 Ariz. 42,659 P. 2d 1, cert. denied, 461 U. S. 971 (1983). Gratuitousviolence would have obtained only if petitioner "knew orshould have known that the victim was dead after the firstpass of the car"--if he "inflicted any violence on the victimwhich he must have known was `beyond the point necessaryto kill.' " Richmond II, 136 Ariz., at 323, 666 P. 2d, at 68.Similarly, needless mutilation was interpreted to mean "distinct acts, apart from the killing, specifically performed tomutilate the victim's body."Ibid. But the concurrenceagreed that a death sentence was appropriate for petitioner,even absent the (F)(6) factor.Justice Feldman dissented. He argued that the murderwas not "especially heinous, cruel or depraved" and that themitigating evidence of petitioner's rehabilitation precluded adeath sentence. Id., at 324-325, 666 P. 2d, at 69-70.We denied certiorari. 464 U. S. 986 (1983). Petitionerfiled a habeas corpus action in the United States DistrictCourt for the District of Arizona, challenging his sentenceand conviction. The District Court denied relief, Richmondv. Ricketts, 640 F. Supp. 767 (1986), and the Ninth Circuitaffirmed, 921 F. 2d 933 (1990). As to the (F)(6) factor, thepanel held that a valid narrowing construction of that factor506us1$$6J 08-22-96 16:50:05 PAGES OPINPGT46 RICHMOND v. LEWISOpinion of the Courthad been imposed in Richmond II and, in the alternative,that petitioner's sentence could stand without that factor despite our decision in Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738(1990). "Elimination of the challenged factor would stillleave enough support for [petitioner's] sentence because thestatute at issue here is not a `weighing' statute." 921 F. 2d,at 947. The opinion later was amended to omit that sen-tence, but the amended opinion still reasoned: "Under thestatute at issue in Clemons, the invalidation of an aggravat-ing circumstance necessarily renders any evidence of mitigation `weightier' or more substantial in a relative sense;the same, however, cannot be said under the terms of theArizona statute at issue here." 948 F. 2d 1473, 1488-1489(1992).The Ninth Circuit denied rehearing en banc, with fourjudges dissenting. Id., at 1476. We granted certiorari, 503U. S. 958 (1992), and now reverse.IIPetitioner challenges his death sentence imposed at resen-tencing in 1980. He argues that the "especially heinous,cruel or depraved" aggravating factor specified by Ariz. Rev.Stat. Ann. $ 13-703(F)(6) (1989), upon which the sentencingjudge relied, was unconstitutionally vague, and that theSupreme Court of Arizona failed to cure this invalidity inRichmond II.The relevant Eighth Amendment law is well defined.First, a statutory aggravating factor is unconstitutionallyvague if it fails to furnish principled guidance for the choicebetween death and a lesser penalty. See, e. g., Maynard v.Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356, 361-364 (1988); Godfrey v. Geor-gia, 446 U. S. 420, 427-433 (1980). Second, in a "weighing"State, where the aggravating and mitigating factors are bal-anced against each other, it is constitutional error for thesentencer to give weight to an unconstitutionally vague ag-gravating factor, even if other, valid aggravating factors ob506us1$$6J 08-22-96 16:50:05 PAGES OPINPGT47Cite as: 506 U. S. 40 (1992)Opinion of the Courttain. See, e. g., Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S. 222, 229-232(1992);Clemons v. Mississippi, supra, at 748-752. Third, astate appellate court may rely upon an adequate narrowingconstruction of the factor in curing this error. SeeLewis v.Jeffers, 497 U. S. 764 (1990); Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639(1990). Finally, in federal habeas corpus proceedings, thestate court's application of the narrowing constructionshould be reviewed under the "rational factfinder" standardofJackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979). See Lewis v.Jeffers, supra, at 781.Arizona's "especially heinous, cruel or depraved" factorwas at issue in Walton v. Arizona, supra. As we explained,"there is no serious argument that [this factor] is not faciallyvague." 497 U. S., at 654. Respondents do not argue thatthe factor had been narrowed adequately prior to petitioner'sresentencing. Thus it would have been error for JudgeRoylston to give weight to the (F)(6) factor, if he indeed bal-anced the aggravating and mitigating factors in resentencingpetitioner, and respondents now agree that the judge did en-gage in this weighing process. See Brief for Respondents44 ("Arizona Is a Weighing State"). The Arizona sentencingstatute provides:"In determining whether to impose a sentence ofdeath . . . the court shall take into account the aggravating and mitigating circumstances included in . . . thissection and shall impose a sentence of death if the courtfinds one or more of the aggravating circumstances . . .and that there are no mitigating circumstances suffi-ciently substantial to call for leniency." Ariz. Rev. Stat.Ann. $ 13-703(E) (1989).This provision governed petitioner's resentencing and remains unamended in relevant part. Read most naturally, itrequires the sentencer to weigh aggravating and mitigatingcircumstances--to determine the relative "substan[ce]" ofthe two kinds of factors. And the provision has been con506us1$$6J 08-22-96 16:50:05 PAGES OPINPGT48 RICHMOND v. LEWISOpinion of the Courtstrued thus by the Supreme Court of Arizona. See, e. g.,State v. Brewer, 170 Ariz. 486, 504, 826 P. 2d 783, 801, cert.denied, post, p. 872; State v. Gretzler, 135 Ariz., at 54-55, 659P. 2d, at 13-14;State v. Valencia, 132 Ariz. 248, 250, 645 P. 2d239, 241 (1982); State v. Brookover, 124 Ariz. 38, 42, 601 P. 2d1322, 1326 (1979). Nor do respondents contend that the(F)(6) factor had no effect on the sentencing judge's calculusand therefore was harmless.Rather, they point toState v. Gretzler, supra, which issuedsubsequent to the resentencing but prior to Richmond II,and which provided an adequate narrowing construction ofthe "especially heinous, cruel or depraved" factor. SeeLewis v. Jeffers, supra, at 777-778 (holding that Gretzlerdefinitions adequately narrowed (F)(6) factor); Walton v. Arizona, supra, at 652-655 (same). Respondents assert thatthe principal opinion in Richmond II properly applied theGretzler construction of the (F)(6) factor, while the concurrence ignored the factor, and that both opinions reweighed.Petitioner argues that the principal opinion improperly applied Gretzler, and that the concurrence did not reweigh.We agree with petitioner that the concurrence in Richmond II did not reweigh. Our prior cases do not specifythe degree of clarity with which a state appellate court mustreweigh in order to cure an otherwise invalid death sentence,see Clemons v. Mississippi, supra, at 750-752; cf. Sochor v.Florida, 504 U. S. 527, 540 (1992) (discussing clarity of stateappellate court's harmless-error analysis); Stringer v. Black,503 U. S., at 229-232 (same), and we need not do so here. Ata minimum, we must determine that the state court actuallyreweighed. "[W]hen the sentencing body is told to weighan invalid factor in its decision, a reviewing court may notassume it would have made no difference if the thumb hadbeen removed from death's side of the scale," id., at 232, norcan a court "cure" the error without deciding, itself, that thevalid aggravating factors are weightier than the mitigatingfactors. "[O]nly constitutional harmless-error analysis or506us1$$6J 08-22-96 16:50:05 PAGES OPINPGT49Cite as: 506 U. S. 40 (1992)Opinion of the Courtreweighing at the trial or appellate level suffices to guarantee that the defendant received an individualized sentence."Ibid. Where the death sentence has been infected by avague or otherwise constitutionally invalid aggravating factor, the state appellate court or some other state sentencermust actually perform a new sentencing calculus, if the sentence is to stand.The concurring justices in Richmond II did not purport toperform such a calculus, or even mention the evidence inmitigation. Respondents suggest that we presume reweighing, both because the justices of the Supreme Courtof Arizona have an obligation to reweigh as part of their"independent review" of death sentences, and because Justices Cameron and Gordon concurred in the portion of theprincipal opinion that articulated this obligation. Althoughthere is some force to this suggestion, any presumption ofreweighing is overcome by the language of the concurrenceitself. After arguing that petitioner's offense did not satisfythe (F)(6) factor, the concurrence offered this brief explanation why a death sentence was justified nonetheless."The criminal record of this defendant, however,clearly places him above the norm of first degree murderers. He has been convicted of another first degreemurder and a kidnapping, each arising in separate incidents. This history of serious violent crime justifiesthe imposition of the death penalty." Richmond II, 136Ariz., at 323-324, 666 P. 2d, at 68-69.The plain meaning of this passage is that petitioner's aggravated background provided a conclusive justification for thedeath penalty. The passage plainly evinces the sort of automatic affirmance rule proscribed in a "weighing" State--"arule authorizing or requiring affirmance of a death sentenceso long as there remains at least one valid aggravating circumstance." Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S., at 751.506us1$$6J 08-22-96 16:50:05 PAGES OPINPGT50 RICHMOND v. LEWISOpinion of the CourtAs to the two justices who joined the principal opinion inRichmond II, Chief Justice Holohan and Justice Hays, petitioner argues that these justices erred by relying upon the(F)(6) "especially heinous, cruel or depraved" factor. Specifically, petitioner contends that the justices refrained from de-termining that he drove the car over Crummett; that in anycase the record before the Supreme Court of Arizona did notsuffice to support such a determination; and that the (F)(6)factor would not apply even if he were the driver, unless heknew when he drove the car over Crummett the second timethat Crummett was already dead. Respondents disputeeach of these points, arguing that Chief Justice Holohan andJustice Hays did determine petitioner to be the driver; thatthe sentencing judge had made an implicit finding on thisscore; and that the (F)(6) factor was applicable to the driver,whether or not he knew Crummett to be dead. The partiesdo agree that a state appellate court can cure a death sen-tence of constitutional error even where only a minority ofthe court relies upon a particular aggravating factor, as inRichmond II, if such reliance is otherwise legitimate. SeeBrief for Respondents 8-33; Reply Brief for Petitioner 3.We assume without deciding that the parties are correct onthis point. Instead, the dispute here is simply whether thejustices who relied upon the (F)(6) factor in Richmond IIought to have done so.Of course, the question to be decided by a federal court onpetition for habeas corpus is not whether the state sentencercommitted state-law error in relying upon an adequately nar-rowed aggravating factor. SeeLewis v. Jeffers, 497 U. S., at780. Rather, the federal, constitutional question is whethersuch reliance is "so arbitrary or capricious as to constitute anindependent due process or Eighth Amendment violation."Ibid. Gretzler, the narrowing construction of Arizona's(F)(6) factor, reads as follows:"[T]he statutory concepts of heinous and depraved in-volve a killer's vile state of mind at the time of the mur506us1$$6J 08-22-96 16:50:05 PAGES OPINPGT51Cite as: 506 U. S. 40 (1992)Opinion of the Courtder, as evidenced by the killer's actions. Our caseshave suggested specific factors which lead to a findingof heinousness or depravity.. . . . ."[One such factor] is the infliction of gratuitous vio-lence on the victim. . . ."[Another] is the needless mutilation of the victim."135 Ariz., at 51-52, 659 P. 2d, at 10-11.A murderer who intentionally drives a car over his victimtwice arguably commits "gratuitous violence" within themeaning of Gretzler, whether or not he knows that the victimis dead after the first pass. An Arizona sentencer would notcommit constitutional error by relying on the (F)(6) factorin sentencing that murderer. Although it may be true thatknowledge of the victim's condition is required as a matterof Arizona law, indeedRichmond II itself may now stand forthat state-law proposition, "federal habeas corpus relief doesnot lie for errors of state law." Lewis v. Jeffers, supra, at780. On the other hand, respondents do agree that, on thefacts of this case, the Eighth Amendment would precludethe application of the (F)(6) factor to petitioner if he did notintentionally drive the car over Crummett. Tr. of Oral Arg.38-39. Cf.Tison v. Arizona, 481 U. S. 137, 156-158 (1987)(conduct short of intentional killing may show culpable mental state that justifies death penalty).But we need not decide whether the principal opinion inRichmond II remained within the constitutional boundariesof the (F)(6) factor. Respondents assume that at least a majority of the Supreme Court of Arizona needed to perform aproper reweighing and vote to affirm petitioner's death sentence if that court was to cure the sentence of the initialvagueness error. See Brief for Respondents 27, 49, n. 16.Thus, even assuming that the two justices who joined theprincipal opinion properly reweighed, their votes did not suffice to validate the death sentence. One more proper votewas needed, but there was none. As we have already ex506us1$$6J 08-22-96 16:50:05 PAGES OPINPGT52 RICHMOND v. LEWISThomas, J., concurringplained, the concurring justices who also voted to affirm peti-tioner's sentence did not perform a curative reweighing,while the dissenter voted to reverse. Therefore petitioner'ssentence is invalid, whether or not the principal opinionproperly relied upon the "especially heinous, cruel or de-praved" factor.IIIPetitioner's death sentence was tainted by Eighth Amend-ment error when the sentencing judge gave weight to anunconstitutionally vague aggravating factor. The SupremeCourt of Arizona did not cure this error, because the twojustices who concurred in affirming the sentence did notactually perform a new sentencing calculus. Thus thesentence, as it stands, violates the Eighth Amendment.We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand with instructions to return the case to the DistrictCourt to enter an order granting the petition for a writ ofhabeas corpus unless the State of Arizona within a reason-able period of time either corrects the constitutional errorin petitioner's death sentence or vacates the sentence andimposes a lesser sentence consistent with law.
