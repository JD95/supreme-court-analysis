FARLEYOpinion of the Courton petitioner Thomas Schiro. For the reasons explainedbelow, we hold that it does not.ISchiro was convicted and sentenced to death for murder.The body of Laura Luebbehusen was discovered in her homeon the morning of February 5, 1981, by her roommate, Dar-lene Hooper, and Darlene Hooper's former husband. Darlene Hooper, who had been away, returned to find the homein disarray. Blood covered the walls and floor; Laura Luebbehusen's semiclad body was lying near the entrance. Thepolice recovered from the scene a broken vodka bottle, a handle and metal portions of an iron, and bottles of various typesof liquor.The pathologist testified that there were a number of con-tusions on the body, including injuries to the head. The victim also had lacerations on one nipple and a thigh, and atear in the vagina, all caused after death. A forensic dentistdetermined that the thigh injury was caused by a humanbite. The cause of death was strangulation.Laura Luebbehusen's car was later found near a halfwayhouse where Schiro was living. Schiro told one counselor atthe halfway house he wanted to discuss something "heavy."App. 53. Schiro later confessed to another counselor that hehad committed the murder. After his arrest, he confessedto an inmate in the county jail that he had been drinking andtaking Quaaludes the night of the killing, and that he had hadintercourse with the victim both before and after killing her.Schiro also admitted the killing to his girlfriend, MaryLee. Schiro told Mary Lee that he gained access to LauraLuebbehusen's house by telling her his car had broken down.Once in the house, he exposed himself to her. She told himthat she was a lesbian, that she had been raped as a child,that she had never otherwise had intercourse before and didnot want to have sex. Nonetheless, Schiro raped her nu-merous times. There was evidence that Schiro forced her510us1$15J 06-18-97 17:25:30 PAGES OPINPGT225Cite as: 510 U. S. 222 (1994)Opinion of the Courtto consume drugs and alcohol. When Laura Luebbehusentried to escape, Schiro restrained and raped her at least oncemore. Then, as Laura Luebbehusen lay or slept on the bed,Schiro realized that she would have to die so that she wouldnot turn him in. He found the vodka bottle and beat her onthe head with it until it broke. He then beat her with theiron and, when she resisted, finally strangled her to death.Schiro dragged her body into another room and sexuallyassaulted the corpse. After the murder, he attempted todestroy evidence linking him to the crime.IIAt the time of the crime, the State of Indiana definedmurder as follows:"A person who:"(1) knowingly or intentionally kills another humanbeing; or"(2) kills another human being while committing orattempting to commit arson, burglary, child molesting,criminal deviate conduct, kidnapping, rape or robbery;"commits murder, a felony." Ind. Code $ 35-42-1-1(Supp. 1978).Schiro was charged with three counts of murder. In CountI he was charged with "knowingly" killing Laura Luebbehusen; in Count II with killing her while committing the crimeof rape; and in Count III with killing her while committingcriminal deviate conduct. App. 3-5. The State sought thedeath penalty for Counts II and III.At trial, Schiro did not contest that he had killed LauraLuebbehusen. Indeed, in closing argument, Schiro's defense attorney stated: "Was there a killing? Sure, no doubtabout it. Did Tom Schiro do it? Sure . . . . There's noquestion about it, I'm not going to try . . . and `bamboozle'this jury. There was a killing and he did it." App. to Brieffor Respondent 24. Instead, the defense argued that Schiro510us1$15J 06-18-97 17:25:30 PAGES OPINPGT226 SCHIRO v. FARLEYOpinion of the Courteither was not guilty by reason of insanity or was guilty butmentally ill, an alternative verdict permitted under Indianalaw.The jury was given 10 possible verdicts, among them the3 murder counts described above, the lesser included offenses of voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, guilty butmentally ill, not guilty by reason of insanity, and not guilty.App. 37-38. After five hours of deliberation, the jury re-turned a verdict of guilty on Count II; it left the remainingverdict sheets blank.Under Indiana law, to obtain the death penalty the Stateis required to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of at least one of nine aggravating factors. Ind. Code$ 35-50-2-9(b) (Supp. 1978). The aggravating factor relevant here is: "[T]he defendant committed the murder by intentionally killing the victim while committing or attemptingto commit . . . rape" or another enumerated felony. $ 35-50-2-9(b)(1). Upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of anaggravating factor, the sentencer weighs the factor againstany mitigating circumstances. When the initial convictionis by a jury, the "jury . . . reconvene[s] for the sentencinghearing" to "recommend to the court whether the death penalty should be imposed." $$ 35-50-2-9(d), (e). The trialjudge makes "the final determination of the sentence, afterconsidering the jury's recommendation." $ 35-50-2-9(e)(2)."The court is not bound by the jury's recommendation," however. Ibid.The primary issue at the sentencing hearing was theweight to be given Schiro's mitigating evidence. Defensecounsel stated to the jury that "I assume by your verdict[at the guilt phase that] you've probably decided" that theaggravating circumstance was proved. App. to Brief forRespondent 31-32. He therefore confined his argument toa plea for leniency, citing Schiro's mental and emotional problems. After considering the statements of counsel, the juryrecommended against the death penalty. The trial judge510us1$15J 06-18-97 17:25:30 PAGES OPINPGT227Cite as: 510 U. S. 222 (1994)Opinion of the Courtrejected the jury's recommendation and sentenced Schiroto death. While the case was pending on direct appeal,the Indiana Supreme Court granted the State's petition toremand the case to the trial court to make written findingsof fact regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances.The trial court found that the State had proved beyond areasonable doubt that "[t]he defendant committed the murder by intentionally killing the victim while committing orattempting to commit . . . rape." App. 46. The trial courtalso found that no mitigating circumstances had been established, and reaffirmed the sentence of death. Id., at 50.The sentence was affirmed on direct appeal to the IndianaSupreme Court. Schiro v. State, 451 N. E. 2d 1047 (1983).This Court denied certiorari. Schiro v. Indiana, 464 U. S.1003 (1983). Schiro sought postconviction relief in statecourt. Again, the Indiana Supreme Court affirmed thejudgment of the trial court. Schiro v. State, 479 N. E. 2d556 (1985). This Court again denied a petition for a writ ofcertiorari. Schiro v. Indiana, 475 U. S. 1036 (1986). Schirothen filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the UnitedStates District Court for the Northern District of Indiana.The District Judge remanded the case to the Indiana courtsfor exhaustion of state remedies. The Indiana SupremeCourt affirmed the conviction and sentence for a third time.Schiro v. State, 533 N. E. 2d 1201 (1989). In so doing, theIndiana Supreme Court rejected Schiro's argument that thejury's failure to convict him on the first murder count operated as an acquittal of intentional murder, and that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibited the use of the intentionalmurder aggravating circumstance for sentencing purposes.The Indiana Supreme Court held that "[felony murder] is notan included offense of [murder] and where the jury, as in theinstant case, finds the defendant guilty of one of the types ofmurder and remains silent on the other, it does not operateas an acquittal of the elements of the type of murder the jury510us1$15J 06-18-97 17:25:30 PAGES OPINPGT228 SCHIRO v. FARLEYOpinion of the Courtchose not to consider." Id., at 1208. This Court deniedcertiorari. Schiro v. Indiana, 493 U. S. 910 (1989).The Federal District Court then denied Schiro's federalhabeas petition. Schiro v. Clark, 754 F. Supp. 646 (ND Ind.1990). The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit af-firmed.Schiro v. Clark, 963 F. 2d 962 (1992). The Courtof Appeals accepted the Indiana Supreme Court's conclusionthat the jury's verdict was not an acquittal on the Count Imurder charge, and that the Double Jeopardy Clause was notviolated by the use of the intentional murder aggravatingcircumstance. The Court of Appeals also concluded thatcollateral estoppel was not implicated since "the defendantmust show that the jury's verdict actually and necessarilydetermined the issue he seeks to foreclose" and "Schiro's con-viction for murder/rape did not act as an acquittal with respect to the pure murder charge as a matter of state law."Id., at 970, n. 7.We granted certiorari, 508 U. S. 905 (1993), to consider whether the trial court violated the Double JeopardyClause by relying on the intentional murder aggravating circumstance. IIIThe State argues that granting relief to Schiro would re-quire the retroactive application of a new rule, in violationof the principle announced in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288(1989) (plurality opinion).Teague analysis is ordinarily ourfirst step when we review a federal habeas case. See, e. g.,Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 466-467 (1993). TheTeague bar to the retroactive application of new rules is not,however, jurisdictional. Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37,40-41 (1990). In this case, the State did not raise theTeague argument in the lower courts. Cf. Parke v. Raley,506 U. S. 20, 26 (1993). While we ordinarily do not reviewclaims made for the first time in this Court, see, e. g., Taylorv.Freeland & Kronz, 503 U. S. 638, 645-646 (1992), we recog-nize that the State, as respondent, is entitled to rely on any510us1$15J 06-18-97 17:25:30 PAGES OPINPGT229Cite as: 510 U. S. 222 (1994)Opinion of the Courtlegal argument in support of the judgment below. See, e. g.,Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U. S. 471, 475, n. 6 (1970).Nevertheless, the State failed to argue Teague in its briefin opposition to the petition for a writ of certiorari. In deciding whether to grant certiorari in a particular case, werely heavily on the submissions of the parties at the petitionstage. See this Court's Rule 15.1. If, as in this case, a legalissue appears to warrant review, we grant certiorari in theexpectation of being able to decide that issue. Since a Statecan waive theTeague bar by not raising it, see Godinez v.Moran, 509 U. S. 389, 397, n. 8 (1993), and since the proprietyof reaching the merits of a dispute is an important consider-ation in deciding whether or not to grant certiorari, theState's omission of any Teague defense at the petition stageis significant. Although we undoubtedly have the discretionto reach the State's Teague argument, we will not do so inthese circumstances.IVSchiro first argues that he could not be sentenced to deathbased on the intentional murder aggravating circumstance,because the sentencing proceeding amounted to a successiveprosecution for intentional murder in violation of the DoubleJeopardy Clause.We have recognized that the Double Jeopardy Clause consists of several protections: "It protects against a secondprosecution for the same offense after acquittal. It protectsagainst a second prosecution for the same offense after con-viction. And it protects against multiple punishments forthe same offense." North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711,717 (1969) (footnotes omitted). These protections stem fromthe underlying premise that a defendant should not be twicetried or punished for the same offense. United States v.Wilson, 420 U. S. 332, 339 (1975). The Clause operates as a"bar against repeated attempts to convict, with consequentsubjection of the defendant to embarrassment, expense, anxi-ety, and insecurity, and the possibility that he may be found510us1$15J 06-18-97 17:25:30 PAGES OPINPGT230 SCHIRO v. FARLEYOpinion of the Courtguilty even though innocent." United States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U. S. 117, 136 (1980). When a defendant has beenacquitted, the "Clause guarantees that the State shall not bepermitted to make repeated attempts to convict him."Wilson, supra, at 343. Where, however, there is "no threat ofeither multiple punishment or successive prosecutions, theDouble Jeopardy Clause is not offended." 420 U. S., at 344(footnote omitted). Thus, our cases establish that the pri-mary evil to be guarded against is successive prosecutions:"[T]he prohibition against multiple trials is the controllingconstitutional principle."DiFrancesco, supra, at 132 (internal citations omitted). See also United States v. MartinLinen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, 569 (1977).Schiro urges us to treat the sentencing phase of a singleprosecution as a successive prosecution for purposes of theDouble Jeopardy Clause. We decline to do so. Our priordecisions are inconsistent with the argument that a first sentencing proceeding can amount to a successive prosecution.In Stroud v. United States, 251 U. S. 15, 17-18 (1919), we heldthat where a defendant's murder conviction was overturnedon appeal, the defendant could be resentenced after retrial.Similarly, we found no constitutional infirmity in holding asecond sentencing hearing where the first sentence was improperly based on a prior conviction for which the defendanthad been pardoned. Lockhart v. Nelson, 488 U. S. 33 (1988).See also North Carolina v. Pearce, supra, at 721 ("[W]ecannot say that the constitutional guarantee against doublejeopardy of its own weight restricts the imposition of an otherwise lawful single punishment" upon retrial); Chaffin v.Stynchcombe, 412 U. S. 17, 23-24 (1973) (same). If a secondsentencing proceeding ordinarily does not violate the DoubleJeopardy Clause, we fail to see how an initial sentencingproceeding could do so.We have also upheld the use of prior convictions to enhance sentences for subsequent convictions, even though thismeans a defendant must, in a certain sense, relitigate in a510us1$15J 06-18-97 17:25:30 PAGES OPINPGT231Cite as: 510 U. S. 222 (1994)Opinion of the Courtsentencing proceeding conduct for which he was previouslytried.Spencer v. Texas, 385 U. S. 554, 560 (1967). Cf.Moore v. Missouri, 159 U. S. 673, 678 (1895) ("[T]he Statemay undoubtedly provide that persons who have been beforeconvicted of a crime may suffer severer punishment for subsequent offences than for a first offence"). In short, as ap-plied to successive prosecutions, the Clause "is written interms of potential or risk of trial and conviction, not punish-ment."Price v. Georgia, 398 U. S. 323, 329 (1970).Our decision in Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U. S. 430(1981), is not to the contrary. Bullington was convicted ofcapital murder. At the first death penalty sentencing proceeding, the jury rejected the death penalty and sentencedhim to a term of years. The conviction was overturned; onresentencing the State again sought the death penalty. InBullington we recognized the general rule that "the DoubleJeopardy Clause imposes no absolute prohibition against theimposition of a harsher sentence at retrial." Id., at 438.Nonetheless, we recognized a narrow exception to this general principle because the capital sentencing scheme at issue"differ[ed] significantly from those employed in any of theCourt's cases where the Double Jeopardy Clause has beenheld inapplicable to sentencing." Ibid. Because the capitalsentencing proceeding "was itself a trial on the issue of punishment," ibid., requiring a defendant to submit to a second,identical proceeding was tantamount to permitting a secondprosecution of an acquitted defendant, id., at 446.This case is manifestly different. Neither the prohibitionagainst a successive trial on the issue of guilt nor the Bullington prohibition against a second capital sentencing proceeding is implicated here--the State did not reprosecuteSchiro for intentional murder, nor did it force him to submitto a second death penalty hearing. It simply conducted asingle sentencing hearing in the course of a single prosecution. The state is entitled to "one fair opportunity" to prosecute a defendant, Bullington, supra, at 446 (internal quota510us1$15J 06-18-97 17:25:30 PAGES OPINPGT232 SCHIRO v. FARLEYOpinion of the Courttion marks omitted), and that opportunity extends not onlyto prosecution at the guilt phase, but also to present evidenceat an ensuing sentencing proceeding.VSchiro also contends that principles of constitutional collat-eral estoppel require vacation of his death sentence. InAshe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436 (1970), we held that theDouble Jeopardy Clause incorporates the doctrine of collateral estoppel in criminal proceedings. See also Dowling v.United States, 493 U. S. 342, 347 (1990). Collateral estoppel,or, in modern usage, issue preclusion, "means simply thatwhen an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by avalid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigatedbetween the same parties in any future lawsuit." Ashe, 397U. S., at 443. Schiro reasons that the jury acquitted him of"intentionally" murdering Laura Luebbehusen, and that asa result, the trial court was precluded from finding the exist-ence of the aggravating circumstance that he "committed themurder by intentionally killing the victim while committingor attempting to commit . . . rape." We do not addresswhether collateral estoppel could bar the use of the "inten-tional" murder aggravating circumstance, because Schiro hasnot met his burden of establishing the factual predicate forthe application of the doctrine, if it were applicable, namely,that an "issue of ultimate fact has once been determined" inhis favor. Ibid.The Indiana Supreme Court concluded that the jury ver-dict did not amount to an acquittal on the intentional murdercount. Schiro v. State, 533 N. E. 2d, at 1201. Ordinarily onhabeas review, we presume the correctness of state courtfindings of fact. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d). Cf. also Cichosv.Indiana, 385 U. S. 76, 79-80 (1966). The preclusive effectof the jury's verdict, however, is a question of federal lawwhich we must review de novo. Cf. Ashe v. Swenson, 397U. S., at 444.510us1$15J 06-18-97 17:25:30 PAGES OPINPGT233Cite as: 510 U. S. 222 (1994)Opinion of the CourtWe must first determine "whether a rational jury couldhave grounded its verdict upon an issue other than" Schiro'sintent to kill. Ibid. Cf. 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E.Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 4421, p. 192 (1981)("Issue preclusion attaches only to determinations that werenecessary to support the judgment entered in the first ac-tion"). To do so, we "examine the record of a prior proceeding taking into account the pleadings, evidence, charge, andother relevant matter . . . ."Ashe v. Swenson, supra, at 444(internal quotation marks omitted). The burden is "on thedefendant to demonstrate that the issue whose relitigationhe seeks to foreclose was actually decided in the first proceeding." Dowling, 493 U. S., at 350. In Dowling, for example, the defendant contended that because he had beenacquitted of a robbery, the jury must have concluded that hehad not been present at the crime. Ibid. In rejecting thatargument, we considered the fact that during the trial therewas a discussion between the lawyers and the judge whereit was asserted that the intruder's identity was not a factualissue in the case. Id., at 351. Because there were "anynumber of possible explanations for the jury's acquittalverdict," the defendant had "failed to satisfy his burden ofdemonstrating" that he was not one of the intruders. Id.,at 352.Applying these principles, we find that the jury could havegrounded its verdict on an issue other than Schiro's intent tokill. The jury was not instructed to return verdicts on allthe counts listed on the verdict sheets. In fact, there areindications in the record that the jury might have believedit could only return one verdict. In closing argument at theguilt phase, defense counsel told the jury that it would "haveto go back there and try to figure out which one of eight orten verdicts . . . that you will return back into this Court."App. to Brief for Respondents 17. The prosecution also toldthe jury that "you are only going to be allowed to return oneverdict." Id., at 27. Although the jury instructions indi510us1$15J 06-18-97 17:25:30 PAGES OPINPGT234 SCHIRO v. FARLEYOpinion of the Courtcated to the jury that more than one verdict was possible,id., at 27-28, on this record it is impossible to tell which ofthese statements the jury relied on. The dissent concludesthat the jury acquitted on Count I for lack of intent, basedon the fact that the only way the jury could have expressedthat conclusion was by leaving the Count I verdict formblank, as it did. What stands in the way of such an inference, however, is that the jury would also have acted as itdid after reaching a guilty verdict on Count II but withoutever deliberating on Count I. In short, since it was not clearto the jury that it needed to consider each count independently, we will not draw any particular conclusion from itsfailure to return a verdict on Count I.The jury instructions on the issue of intent to kill werealso ambiguous. Under Indiana law, a person who either"knowingly or intentionally kills another human being" or"kills another human being while committing or attemptingto commit . . . rape" is guilty of "murder." Ind. Code $ 35-42-1-1 (Supp. 1978). Thus, intent to kill is not required fora felony murder conviction. Schiro reasons that since thejury found him guilty of felony murder in the course of arape, but failed to convict him of intentional murder, the jurymust have found that he did not have an intent to kill.We do not so interpret the jury's failure to convict onCount I, however. Although the jury was provided with thestate law definition of murder, App. 21, the judge also instructed the jury that the State had to prove intent for bothfelony and intentional murder: "To sustain the charge ofmurder, the State must prove . . . [t]hat the defendant engaged in the conduct which caused the death of Laura Luebbehusen [and] [t]hat when the defendant did so, he knew theconduct would or intended the conduct to cause the deathof Laura Luebbehusen." Id., at 22-23 (emphasis added).This instruction did not differentiate between the two waysof proving "murder" under Indiana law. The jury was fur510us1$15J 06-18-97 17:25:30 PAGES OPINPGT235Cite as: 510 U. S. 222 (1994)Opinion of the Courtther told that "[t]he instructions of the court are the bestsource as to the law applicable to this case." Id., at 20.The jury may well have believed, therefore, that it was re-quired to find a knowing or intentional killing in order toconvict Schiro on any of the three murder counts. In sum,in light of the jury instructions, we find that as a matter oflaw the jury verdict did not necessarily depend on a findingthat Schiro lacked an intent to kill.Although not necessary to our conclusion, we note thatthere is additional evidence in the record indicating thatSchiro's intent to kill was not a significant issue in the case.The defense primarily confined its proof at trial to showingthat Schiro was insane, and did not dispute that Schiro hadcommitted the murder. At no point during the guilt phasedid defense counsel or any of the defense witnesses assertthat Schiro should be acquitted on Count I because he lackedan intent to kill. Indeed, we have located no point in thetranscript of the proceedings where defense counsel or defense witnesses even discussed the issue of Schiro's intent tokill. Schiro argues that his intent to kill was put in issueby the insanity defense. But, even if that were so, the jurydid not accept this defense. Even defense counsel apparently believed that Schiro's intent was not an issue in thecase. After the jury returned its verdict of guilty on CountII, and reconvened to consider the appropriate sentence, de-fense counsel indicated his belief that by convicting Schiroon Count II, the jury had found that he had an intent to kill:"The statute . . . provides for aggravating circumstances.There is one listed in this case, and one which you mayconsider. And that one is that the murder was committed, was intentionally committed in the commissionof rape and some other things. I assume by your verdict Friday, or Saturday, that you've probably . . . de-cided that issue. In finding him guilty of murder in thecommission of rape, I'm assuming you've decided beyond510us1$15J 06-18-97 17:25:30 PAGES OPINPGT236 SCHIRO v. FARLEYOpinion of the Courta reasonable doubt that it was done in the commissionof a rape, and so that aggravating circumstance mostlikely exists in your mind." App. to Brief for Respondent 31-32.Finally, we observe that a jury finding of intent to kill isentirely consistent with the evidence presented at trial. BySchiro's own admission, he decided to kill Laura Luebbehusen after she tried to escape and he realized she would goto the police. In addition, the physical evidence suggesteda deliberate, rather than unintentional, accidental, or evenreckless, killing. The victim was repeatedly beaten with abottle and an iron; when she resisted, she was strangled todeath.We have in some circumstances considered jury silence astantamount to an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes.Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 190-191 (1957); Pricev. Georgia, 398 U. S., at 329. The failure to return a verdictdoes not have collateral estoppel effect, however, unless therecord establishes that the issue was actually and necessarilydecided in the defendant's favor. As explained above, ourcases require an examination of the entire record to determine whether the jury could have "grounded its verdict uponan issue other than that which the defendant seeks to foreclose from consideration." Ashe, 397 U. S., at 444 (internalquotation marks omitted). See also Dowling, 493 U. S., at350. In view of Schiro's confession to the killing, the instruction requiring the jury to find intent to kill, and theuncertainty as to whether the jury believed it could returnmore than one verdict, we find that Schiro has not met his"burden . . . to demonstrate that the issue whose relitigationhe seeks to foreclose was actually decided" in his favor.Ibid.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
