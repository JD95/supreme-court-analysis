These cases present the question whether conviction forconspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of 18U. S. C. $ 1956(h), requires proof of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. We hold that it does not.IIn March 1999, a federal grand jury returned a 20-countindictment against petitioners and five codefendants. Asrelevant here, Count II of the indictment charged petitionerswith conspiracy to launder money, in violation of $ 1956(h).The indictment described, in general terms, the "manner andmeans" used to accomplish the objects of the money laundering conspiracy, but it did not charge the defendants with thecommission of any overt act in furtherance thereof.At trial, the Government presented evidence that petitioners were members of the executive board of an entity knownas Greater Ministries International Church (GMIC). GMICoperated a "gifting" program that took in more than $400million between 1996 and 1999. Under that program, petitioners and others induced unwary investors to give moneyto GMIC with promises that investors would receive doubletheir money back within a year and a half. Petitioners marketed the program throughout the country, claiming thatGMIC would generate returns on investors' "gifts" throughoverseas investments in gold and diamond mining, commodities, and offshore banks. Investors were told that GMICwould use some of the profits for philanthropic purposes.Most of these claims were false. GMIC made none of thepromised investments, had no assets, and gave virtuallynothing to charity. Many participants in GMIC's programreceived little or no return on their money, and their investments indeed largely turned out to be "gifts" to GMIC representatives. Petitioners together allegedly received morethan $1.2 million in commissions on the money they solicited.543US1 Unit: $U13 [03-06-07 13:39:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN212 WHITFIELD v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtAt the close of the evidence, petitioners asked the DistrictCourt to instruct the jury that the Government was requiredto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that at least one of theco-conspirators had committed an overt act in furtheranceof the money laundering conspiracy. The court denied thatrequest, and the jury returned a verdict of guilty on themoney laundering conspiracy charge.The Eleventh Circuit affirmed petitioners' convictions,holding, in relevant part, that the jury instructions approvedby the District Court were proper because $ 1956(h) does notrequire proof of an overt act. 349 F. 3d 1320, 1324 (2003).The Court of Appeals noted that some of its sister Circuitshad taken the opposite position. Id., at 1323 (citing UnitedStates v. Wilson, 249 F. 3d 366, 379 (CA5 2001); United Statesv. Hildebrand, 152 F. 3d 756, 762 (CA8 1998)). It concluded,however, that those decisions were erroneously based oncase law interpreting the general conspiracy statute, 18U. S. C. $ 371, which, unlike $ 1956(h), expressly includes anovert-act requirement. 349 F. 3d, at 1323. The EleventhCircuit instead relied upon United States v. Shabani, 513U. S. 10 (1994), where we held that the drug conspiracy statute, 21 U. S. C. $ 846, does not require proof of an overt act.Because the language of 18 U. S. C. $ 1956(h) and 21 U. S. C.$ 846 is "nearly identical," the Eleventh Circuit found itselfcompelled to follow the reasoning ofShabani in holding that$ 1956(h), too, requires no proof of an overt act. 349 F. 3d,at 1323-1324. We granted certiorari to resolve the conflictamong the Circuits on the question presented, 542 U. S. 918(2004), and we now affirm the decision below.IICongress enacted 18 U. S. C. $$ 1956 and 1957 (2000 ed. andSupp. II) as part of the Money Laundering Control Act of1986, Pub. L. 99-570, 100 Stat. 3207-18. Section 1956 penal-izes the knowing and intentional transportation or transferof monetary proceeds from specified unlawful activities,543US1 Unit: $U13 [03-06-07 13:39:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN213Cite as: 543 U. S. 209 (2005)Opinion of the Courtwhile $ 1957 addresses transactions involving criminally de-rived property exceeding $10,000 in value. As originallyenacted, neither section included a conspiracy provision.Accordingly, the Government relied on the general conspiracy statute, 18 U. S. C. $ 371, to prosecute conspiracies tocommit the offenses set forth in $$ 1956 and 1957. In 1992,however, Congress enacted the money laundering conspiracyprovision at issue in these cases, now codified at 18 U. S. C.$ 1956(h). See Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money LaunderingAct, Pub. L. 102-550, $ 1530, 106 Stat. 4066. Section 1956(h)provides: "Any person who conspires to commit any offensedefined in [$ 1956] or section 1957 shall be subject to thesame penalties as those prescribed for the offense the commission of which was the object of the conspiracy."In Shabani, we addressed whether the nearly identicallanguage of the drug conspiracy statute, 21 U. S. C. $ 846,requires proof of an overt act. See ibid. ("Any person whoattempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in thissubchapter shall be subject to the same penalties as thoseprescribed for the offense, the commission of which was theobject of the attempt or conspiracy"). We held that it doesnot, relying principally upon our earlier decisions in Nash v.United States, 229 U. S. 373 (1913), and Singer v. UnitedStates, 323 U. S. 338 (1945). See Shabani, supra, at 13-14.In each of those cases, the Court held that, where Congresshad omitted from the relevant conspiracy provision any language expressly requiring an overt act, the Court wouldnot read such a requirement into the statute. See Singer,supra, at 340 (Selective Training and Service Act of 1940);Nash, supra, at 378 (Sherman Act).As we explained in Shabani, these decisions "follow thesettled principle of statutory construction that, absent contrary indications, Congress intends to adopt the common lawdefinition of statutory terms. See Molzof v. United States,502 U. S. 301, 307-308 (1992). We have consistently heldthat the common law understanding of conspiracy `does not543US1 Unit: $U13 [03-06-07 13:39:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN214 WHITFIELD v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtmake the doing of any act other than the act of conspiring acondition of liability.' " 513 U. S., at 13-14 (quoting Nash,supra, at 378). In concluding that the drug conspiracy stat-ute in Shabani did not require proof of an overt act, we foundinstructive the distinction between that statute and the gen-eral conspiracy statute, $ 371, which supersedes the commonlaw rule by expressly including an overt-act requirement.513 U. S., at 14. See 18 U. S. C. $ 371 ("If two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against theUnited States, or to defraud the United States, or anyagency thereof in any manner or for any purpose, and oneor more of such persons do any act to effect the object of theconspiracy, each shall be fined under this title or imprisonednot more than five years, or both" (emphasis added)).Shabani distilled the governing rule for conspiracy statutes as follows: " `Nash and Singer give Congress a formu-lary: by choosing a text modeled on $ 371, it gets an overt-actrequirement; by choosing a text modeled on the ShermanAct, 15 U. S. C. $ 1 [which, like 21 U. S. C. $ 846, omits anyexpress overt-act requirement], it dispenses with such a re-quirement.' " 513 U. S., at 14 (quotingUnited States v.Sassi, 966 F. 2d 283, 284 (CA7 1992)). This rule dictates theoutcome in the instant cases as well: Because the text of$ 1956(h) does not expressly make the commission of an overtact an element of the conspiracy offense, the Governmentneed not prove an overt act to obtain a conviction.IIIPetitioners argue that the rule that governed Shabani isinapplicable here, because $ 1956(h) does not establish a newconspiracy offense; rather, they say, it merely increases thepenalty for conviction of a money laundering conspiracyunder $ 371. In other words, as we understand their argu-ment, petitioners contend that the Government must continue to prosecute money laundering conspiracies under$ 371, but that $ 1956(h) now provides enhanced penalties for543US1 Unit: $U13 [03-06-07 13:39:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN215Cite as: 543 U. S. 209 (2005)Opinion of the Courtconviction. Since $ 371 contains an overt act requirement,the argument goes, the Government must prove an overtact in prosecutions ostensibly brought under $ 1956(h). Thisreading of $ 1956(h) is untenable for two principal reasons.First, petitioners concede--as they must--that $ 1956(h)'stext is sufficient to establish an offense. Indeed, its language is nearly identical to the drug conspiracy statute atissue in Shabani, which indisputably created an offense.Second, petitioners apparently read $ 1956(h) to supply anenhanced penalty for violation of $ 371 in cases where theobject of the conspiracy is to violate the substantive moneylaundering offenses in $$ 1956(a) and 1957. But the text of$ 1956(h) fails to provide any cross-reference to $ 371. Mereuse of the word "conspires" surely is not enough to establishthe necessary link between these two separate statutes. Inshort, if Congress had intended to create the scheme petitioners envision, it would have done so in clearer terms.Petitioners seek support for their construction of $ 1956(h)in the provision's legislative history. They contend that thishistory contains no indication that Congress meant to createa new offense or to eliminate the pre-existing overt-act requirement for money laundering conspiracy prosecutionsthat hitherto had been brought under $ 371. They say thatthe history instead shows that $ 1956(h) was intended onlyto raise the penalty for money laundering conspiracy fromthe 5-year maximum sentence under $ 371 to the greatermaximums available for substantive money laundering offenses under $$ 1956(a) and 1957. Petitioners also point outthat, when Congress enacted $ 1956(h), it did so under thetitle "Penalty for Money Laundering Conspiracies," 106Stat., at 4066 (emphasis added). Had Congress wanted toenact an "offense" provision, they argue, it would have titledit accordingly.Because the meaning of $ 1956(h)'s text is plain and unambiguous, we need not accept petitioners' invitation to consider the legislative history. But even were we to do so,543US1 Unit: $U13 [03-06-07 13:39:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN216 WHITFIELD v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtwe would reach the same conclusion. It is undisputed thatCongress intended $ 1956(h) to increase the penalties formoney laundering conspiracies. The provision's text makesclear that Congress did so precisely by establishing a newoffense. Given the clarity of the text, mere silence in thelegislative history cannot justify reading an overt-act requirement, or a cross-reference to $ 371, into $ 1956(h). See,e. g., United States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 496-497 (1997)(refusing to read a materiality element into the statute atissue based on silence in the legislative history); Harrison v.PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U. S. 578, 592 (1980) ("[I]t wouldbe a strange canon of statutory construction that would require Congress to state in committee reports or elsewherein its deliberations that which is obvious on the face of astatute"). Nor do we find it significant that Congress choseto label $ 1956(h) a "penalty" rather than an "offense" provision. See Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524U. S. 206, 212 (1998) (" `[T]he title of a statute . . . cannotlimit the plain meaning of the text' "); Castillo v. UnitedStates, 530 U. S. 120, 125 (2000) (although "[t]he title of theentirety of $ 924 is `Penalties' . . . at least some portion of$ 924 . . . creates, not penalty enhancements, but entirelynew crimes").Petitioners' legislative history argument is particularlyinapt here, we might add, because Congress is presumed tohave knowledge of the governing rule described in Shabani.While Shabani was decided two years after $ 1956(h) wasenacted, the rule it articulated was established decades earlier in Nash and Singer. These decisions establish a "formulary" that provides clear and predictable guidance toCongress. As the Government points out, Congress hasincluded an express overt-act requirement in at least 22other current conspiracy statutes, clearly demonstrating thatit knows how to impose such a requirement when it wishesto do so. See Brief for United States 11, and n. 5 (citingstatutes). Where Congress has chosen not to do so, we will543US1 Unit: $U13 [03-06-07 13:39:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN217Cite as: 543 U. S. 209 (2005)Opinion of the Courtnot override that choice based on vague and ambiguous sig-nals from legislative history.We conclude by addressing two arguments raised by peti-tioners relating to the text and structure of $ 1956 as a whole.First, petitioners note that Congress placed each of the threesubstantive money laundering offenses in $ 1956 under subsection (a). Had the drafters intended $ 1956(h) to create anew offense, petitioners contend, they would have placed itwith the other offenses in subsection (a) instead of in its ownseparate subsection. We fail to see why that should be so.The three offenses placed in subsection (a) share a commonfeature: All are substantive money laundering crimes. Wefind nothing remarkable in Congress' decision to place a qualitatively different conspiracy offense provision in a separate subsection.Petitioners' second textual argument is based on $ 1956(i)(2000 ed., Supp. II), a venue provision added to the statutein 2001. See USA PATRIOT ACT, Pub. L. 107-56, $ 1004,115 Stat. 392. Section 1956(i)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. II) provides that "[a] prosecution for an attempt or conspiracy offense under [$ 1956 or $ 1957] may be brought in the districtwhere venue would lie for the completed offense under[$ 1956(i)(1)], or in any other district where an act in furtherance of the attempt or conspiracy took place." Petitionerscontend that, by setting venue in the district where an overtact took place, Congress confirmed what (petitioners say)was the majority view of the Courts of Appeals at the timeof $ 1956(i)'s enactment: that proof of an overt act was required under $ 1956(h). Moreover, petitioners argue, settingvenue where an overt act took place makes little sense ifsuch an act is not an element of the offense.This argument fails for several reasons. As a preliminarymatter, petitioners assume that $ 1956(i) is the sole provisionsetting venue in money laundering conspiracy prosecutions.Although we need not definitively construe that provisionhere, we note that its language appears permissive rather543US1 Unit: $U13 [03-06-07 13:39:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN218 WHITFIELD v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtthan exclusive--$ 1956(i) says a conspiracy prosecution "maybe brought" in a district meeting the specified criteria.(Emphasis added.) This suggests that the provision servesto supplement, rather than supplant, the default venue rule:"Unless a statute or these rules permit otherwise, the government must prosecute an offense in a district where theoffense was committed." Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 18. For aconspiracy prosecution under the common law rule, the district in which the unlawful agreement was reached wouldsatisfy this default venue rule. See Hyde v. Shine, 199 U. S.62, 76 (1905).But even if we assume, for the sake of argument, that$ 1956(i) is an exclusive venue provision, petitioners' argument still fails. The provision authorizes two alternativevenues for money laundering conspiracy prosecutions: (1) thedistrict in which venue would lie if the completed substantive money laundering offense had been accomplished, or(2) any district in which an overt act in furtherance of theconspiracy was committed. The first venue option clearlydoes not require that any overt act have been committed,and the Government therefore need not allege or prove suchan act for venue to be properly established under this portion of $ 1956(i). As to the second venue option, this Courthas long held that venue is proper in any district in whichan overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy was committed,even where an overt act is not a required element of theconspiracy offense. See, e. g., United States v. SoconyVacuum Oil Co., 310 U. S. 150, 252 (1940); United States v.Trenton Potteries Co., 273 U. S. 392, 402-404 (1927). Inlight of this longstanding rule, $ 1956(i)(2)'s authorization ofvenue in a district where an overt act took place cannot betaken to indicate that Congress deemed such an act necessary for conviction under $ 1956(h). Instead, Congress appears merely to have confirmed the availability of this alternative venue option in money laundering conspiracy cases.543US1 Unit: $U13 [03-06-07 13:39:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN219Cite as: 543 U.
