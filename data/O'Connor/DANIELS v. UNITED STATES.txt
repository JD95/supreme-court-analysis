S. 485, 490-497, this Court heldthat with the sole exception of convictions obtained in violation of theright to counsel, a defendant has no right under the ACCA or the Constitution to collaterally attack prior convictions at his federal sentencingproceeding. The considerations supporting that conclusion--ease of administration and the interest in promoting the finality of judgments--are also present in the $ 2255 context. A district court evaluating a$ 2255 motion is as unlikely as a district court engaged in sentencingto have the documents necessary to evaluate claims arising from longpast proceedings in a different jurisdiction. Moreover, States retain astrong interest in preserving convictions they have obtained, as theyimpose a wide range of disabilities on those who have been convicted,even after their release.

S. 374 (2001)Syllabus(b) Although defendants may challenge their convictions for constitutional infirmity, it does not necessarily follow that a $ 2255 motion is anappropriate vehicle for determining whether a conviction later used toenhance a federal sentence was unconstitutionally obtained. A defendant convicted in state court has numerous opportunities to challenge theconstitutionality of that conviction, but those vehicles for review are notavailable indefinitely and without limitation. Procedural barriers limitaccess to review on the merits of constitutional claims, vindicating thepresumption of regularity that attaches to final judgments, even whenthe question is waiver of constitutional rights. Parke v. Raley, 506U. S. 20, 29. Thus, if, by the time of sentencing under the ACCA, aprior conviction has not been set aside on direct or collateral review, itis presumptively valid and may be used to enhance the federal sentence,with the exception of convictions obtained in violation of the right tocounsel. Custis, supra, at 496-497. After an enhanced federal sentence has been imposed under the ACCA, the person sentenced maypursue any channels of direct or collateral review still available to challenge his prior conviction. If, however, a prior conviction used to enhance a federal sentence is no longer open to attack in its own rightbecause the defendant failed to pursue those remedies while they wereavailable (or because he did so unsuccessfully), then he is without recourse. The defendant may not collaterally attack his prior convictionthrough a motion under $ 2255, unless he claims that conviction wasobtained in violation of the right to counsel and he raised that claim athis federal sentencing proceeding. A contrary rule would effectivelypermit challenges far too stale to be brought in their own right, andsanction an end run around statutes of limitation and other proceduralbarriers that would preclude the movant from attacking the prior conviction directly. Nothing in the Constitution or this Court's precedentrequires such a result. Pp. 380-383.O'Connor, J., delivered the opinion of the Court in part, in which Rehnquist, C.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtGeneral Waxman, Assistant Attorney General Robinson,James A. Feldman, and Kathleen A. Felton.*Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court inpart.In Custis v. United States, 511 U. S. 485 (1994), we ad-dressed whether a defendant sentenced under the ArmedCareer Criminal Act of 1984 (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. $ 924(e),could collaterally attack the validity of previous state convictions used to enhance his federal sentence. We held that,with the sole exception of convictions obtained in violationof the right to counsel, a defendant has no right to bring sucha challenge in his federal sentencing proceeding. 511 U. S.,at 487. We now consider whether, after the sentencing pro-ceeding has concluded, the individual who was sentencedmay challenge his federal sentence through a motion under28 U. S. C. $ 2255 (1994 ed., Supp. V) on the ground that hisprior convictions were unconstitutionally obtained. We holdthat, as a general rule, he may not. There may be rare circumstances in which $ 2255 would be available, but we neednot address the issue here.IIn 1994, petitioner Earthy D. Daniels, Jr., was tried andconvicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1). The Government then soughtto enhance his sentence under the ACCA. App. 4-5. TheACCA imposes a mandatory minimum 15-year sentence onanyone who violates $ 922(g)(1) and who has three previousconvictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense.$ 924(e)(1). Petitioner had been convicted in California in1978 and 1981 for robbery, and in 1977 and 1979 for firstdegree burglary.Id., at 14. The District Court found petitioner to be an armed career criminal within the meaning of*Kent S. Scheidegger filed a brief for the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation as amicus curiae urging affirmance.532US2 Unit: $U45 [09-06-02 12:45:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN377Cite as: 532 U.

Had petitioner not been adjudged an armed careercriminal, he would have received at most a 120-month sentence. 18 U. S. C. $ 924(a)(2). On direct appeal, petitionerargued unsuccessfully that his two burglary convictions didnot qualify as predicate offenses under the ACCA. See 86F. 3d 1164 (CA9 1996) (table).Petitioner then filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 in the UnitedStates District Court for the Central District of California.Section 2255, a postconviction remedy for federal prisoners,permits "[a] prisoner in custody under sentence of a [federal]court" to "move the court which imposed the sentence tovacate, set aside or correct the sentence" upon the groundthat "the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States." Petitioner asserted thathis current federal sentence was imposed in violation of theConstitution because it was based in part on his 1978 and1981 robbery convictions. Those prior convictions, he alleged, were themselves unconstitutional because they bothwere based on guilty pleas that were not knowing and voluntary, and because the 1981 conviction was also the productof ineffective assistance of counsel. App. 51-52. He didnot contend that $ 2255 relief was appropriate because hiscurrent sentence was imposed in violation of the ACCA.Cf. Brief for Petitioner 13.The District Court denied the $ 2255 motion, App. 58-67,and a panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed,195 F. 3d 501 (1999). The court held that our decision inCustis "bar[s] federal habeas review of the validity of a priorconviction used for federal sentencing enhancement unlessthe petitioner raises a . . . claim [under Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963)]." 195 F. 3d, at 503 (internalquotation marks and citation omitted). Because the Courtsof Appeals are divided as to whether Custis bars relief under532US2 Unit: $U45 [09-06-02 12:45:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN378 DANIELS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court$ 2255 as well as in federal sentencing proceedings, wegranted certiorari. 530 U. S. 1299 (2000).IIThe petitioner in Custis attempted, during his federal sen-tencing proceeding, to attack prior state convictions used toenhance his sentence under the ACCA. Like petitionerhere, Custis challenged his prior convictions as the productof allegedly faulty guilty pleas and ineffective assistance ofcounsel. 511 U. S., at 488. We held that with the sole exception of convictions obtained in violation of the right tocounsel, Custis had no right under the ACCA or the Constitution "to collaterally attack prior convictions" in the courseof his federal sentencing proceeding.Id., at 490-497.While the "failure to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant was a unique constitutional defect" that justified theexception for challenges concerning Gideon v. Wainwright,372 U. S. 335 (1963), 511 U. S., at 496, challenges of the typeCustis sought to bring did not "ris[e] to the level of a jurisdictional defect," ibid.Two considerations supported our constitutional conclusion in Custis: ease of administration and the interest inpromoting the finality of judgments. With respect to theformer, we noted that resolving non-Gideon-type constitu-tional attacks on prior convictions "would require sentencingcourts to rummage through frequently nonexistent or diffi-cult to obtain state-court transcripts or records." 511 U. S.,at 496. With respect to the latter, we observed that allow-ing collateral attacks would "inevitably delay and impair theorderly administration of justice" and "deprive the state-court judgment of its normal force and effect."Id., at 497(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).APetitioner contends that the Custis rule should not extendto $ 2255 proceedings because the concerns we articulated532US2 Unit: $U45 [09-06-02 12:45:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN379Cite as: 532 U. S. 374 (2001)Opinion of the Courtin Custis are not present in the $ 2255 context. Brief forPetitioner 22-26. We disagree. First, a district courtevaluating a $ 2255 motion is as unlikely as a district courtengaged in sentencing to have the documents necessary toevaluate claims arising from long-past proceedings in a dif-ferent jurisdiction. While petitioner is quite right that federal district courts are capable of evaluating fact-intensiveconstitutional claims raised by way of a habeas petition, id.,at 22-23, institutional competence does not make decades-oldstate court records and transcripts any easier to locate.The facts of this case only reinforce our concern. For example, petitioner contends that he entered his 1978 and 1981guilty pleas without a full understanding of the essential elements of the crimes with which he was charged, and therefore the resulting convictions violated due process. App.40-42, 50-51. These claims by their nature require closescrutiny of the record below. Yet petitioner has not placedthe transcript from either plea colloquy in the record. Infact, he has admitted that the 1978 transcript is missing fromthe state court file. Cf. id., at 38, n. 3. Under these circumstances, it would be an almost futile exercise for a districtcourt to attempt to determine accurately what was communicated to petitioner more than two decades ago.With respect to the concern for finality, petitioner arguesthat because he has served the complete sentences for his1978 and 1981 convictions, the State would suffer little, ifany, prejudice if those convictions were invalidated througha collateral challenge under $ 2255. Brief for Petitioner 24-26. To the contrary, even after a defendant has served thefull measure of his sentence, a State retains a strong interestin preserving the convictions it has obtained. States imposea wide range of disabilities on those who have been convictedof crimes, even after their release. For example, in California, where petitioner committed his crimes, persons convicted of a felony may be disqualified from holding publicoffice, subjected to restrictions on professional licensing, and532US2 Unit: $U45 [09-06-02 12:45:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN380 DANIELS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtbarred from possessing firearms. See U. S. Dept. of Justice,Office of the Pardon Attorney, Civil Disabilities of ConvictedFelons: A State-By-State Survey 29-32 (Oct. 1996). Fur-ther, each of the 50 States has a statute authorizing enhancedsentences for recidivist offenders. E. g., Cal. Penal CodeAnn. $ 667 (West 1999). See also Parke v. Raley, 506 U. S.20, 26-27 (1992).At oral argument, petitioner suggested that invalidating aprior conviction on constitutional grounds for purposes of itsuse under the ACCA would have no effect beyond the federalproceeding. Tr. of Oral Arg. 8-10. Although that questionis not squarely presented here, if a state conviction weredetermined to be sufficiently unreliable that it could not beused to enhance a federal sentence, the State's ability to usethat judgment subsequently for its own purposes would be,at the very least, greatly undermined. Thus, the State doeshave a real and continuing interest in the integrity of itsjudgments.BOn the most fundamental level, petitioner attempts to dis-tinguish Custis as a decision only about the appropriateforum in which a defendant may challenge prior convictionsused to enhance a federal sentence. The issue in Custis, according to petitioner, was " `where, not whether, the defend-ant could attack a prior conviction for constitutional infirmity.' " Brief for Petitioner 14 (quoting Nichols v. UnitedStates, 511 U. S. 738, 765 (1994) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting)(original emphasis deleted)). The appropriate forum forsuch a challenge, petitioner argues, at least where no otherforum is available, is a federal proceeding under $ 2255.Brief for Petitioner 16.The premise underlying petitioner's argument--that defendants may challenge their convictions for constitutionalinfirmity--is quite correct. It is beyond dispute that convictions must be obtained in a manner that comports with theFederal Constitution. But it does not necessarily follow532US2 Unit: $U45 [09-06-02 12:45:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN381Cite as: 532 U. S. 374 (2001)Opinion of the Courtthat a $ 2255 motion is an appropriate vehicle for determining whether a conviction later used to enhance a federal sentence was unconstitutionally obtained.Our system affords a defendant convicted in state courtnumerous opportunities to challenge the constitutionality ofhis conviction. He may raise constitutional claims on directappeal, in postconviction proceedings available under statelaw, and in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus broughtpursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 (1994 ed. and Supp. V). Seegenerally 1 J. Liebman & R. Hertz, Federal Habeas CorpusPractice and Procedure $ 5.1.a (3d ed. 1998).1 These vehiclesfor review, however, are not available indefinitely and without limitation. Procedural barriers, such as statutes oflimitations and rules concerning procedural default and exhaustion of remedies, operate to limit access to review onthe merits of a constitutional claim. See, e. g., United Statesv. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 731 (1993) (" `No procedural principleis more familiar to this Court than that a constitutionalright . . . may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil casesby the failure to make timely assertion of the right before atribunal having jurisdiction to determine it' " (quoting Yakusv. United States, 321 U. S. 414, 444 (1944))). One of the principles vindicated by these limitations is a "presumptiondeeply rooted in our jurisprudence: the `presumption of regularity' that attaches to final judgments, even when the question is waiver of constitutional rights." Parke, supra, at 29.1 Justice Souter is concerned that a defendant may forgo "direct challenge because the penalty was not practically worth challenging, and . . .collateral attack because he had no counsel to speak for him." Post, at391 (dissenting opinion). Whatever incentives may exist at the time ofconviction, the fact remains that avenues of redress are generally availableif sought in a timely manner. If a person chooses not to pursue thoseremedies, he does so with the knowledge that the conviction will stay onhis record. This knowledge should serve as an incentive not to commit asubsequent crime and risk having the sentence for that crime enhancedunder a recidivist sentencing statute.532US2 Unit: $U45 [09-06-02 12:45:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN382 DANIELS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtThus, we have held that if, by the time of sentencing underthe ACCA, a prior conviction has not been set aside on director collateral review, that conviction is presumptively validand may be used to enhance the federal sentence. SeeCustis, 511 U. S., at 497. This rule is subject to only one excep-tion: If an enhanced federal sentence will be based in parton a prior conviction obtained in violation of the right tocounsel, the defendant may challenge the validity of his priorconviction during his federal sentencing proceedings.Id.,at 496. No other constitutional challenge to a prior convic-tion may be raised in the sentencing forum.Id., at 497.After an enhanced federal sentence has been imposed pursuant to the ACCA, the person sentenced may pursue anychannels of direct or collateral review still available to challenge his prior conviction. In Custis, we noted the possibility that the petitioner there, who was still in custody on hisprior convictions, could "attack his state sentences [in statecourt] or through federal habeas review." Ibid. If anysuch challenge to the underlying conviction is successful, thedefendant may then apply for reopening of his federal sentence. As in Custis, we express no opinion on the appropriate disposition of such an application. Cf. ibid.If, however, a prior conviction used to enhance a federalsentence is no longer open to direct or collateral attack inits own right because the defendant failed to pursue thoseremedies while they were available (or because the defendant did so unsuccessfully), then that defendant is withoutrecourse. The presumption of validity that attached to theprior conviction at the time of sentencing is conclusive, andthe defendant may not collaterally attack his prior convictionthrough a motion under $ 2255. A defendant may challengea prior conviction as the product of a Gideon violation in a$ 2255 motion, but generally only if he raised that claim athis federal sentencing proceeding. See United States v.Frady, 456 U. S. 152, 167-168 (1982) (holding that proceduraldefault rules developed in the habeas corpus context apply532US2 Unit: $U45 [09-06-02 12:45:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN383Cite as: 532 U. S. 374 (2001)Opinion of O'Connor, J.in $ 2255 cases); see also Reed v. Farley, 512 U. S. 339, 354-355 (1994).Justice Souter says that our holding here "rul[es] outthe application of $ 2255 when the choice is relief under $ 2255or no relief at all." Post, at 390 (dissenting opinion). Thisall-or-nothing characterization of the problem misses thepoint. As we have said, a defendant generally has ampleopportunity to obtain constitutional review of a state conviction. Supra, at 381. But once the "door" to such review"has been closed,"post, at 388, by the defendant himself--either because he failed to pursue otherwise available remedies or because he failed to prove a constitutional violation--the conviction becomes final and the defendant is not entitledto another bite at the apple simply because that convictionis later used to enhance another sentence.To be sure, the text of $ 2255 is broad enough to cover aclaim that an enhanced federal sentence violates due process.See ibid. See also n. 2, infra. But when such a due processclaim is predicated on the consideration at sentencing of afully expired prior conviction, we think that the goals of easyadministration and finality have ample "horsepower" to justify foreclosing relief under $ 2255. Were we to allow de-fendants sentenced under the ACCA to collaterally attackprior convictions through a $ 2255 motion, we would effec-tively permit challenges far too stale to be brought in theirown right, and sanction an end run around statutes of limita-tions and other procedural barriers that would preclude themovant from attacking the prior conviction directly. Noth-ing in the Constitution or our precedent requires such aresult. CWe recognize that there may be rare cases in which nochannel of review was actually available to a defendant withrespect to a prior conviction, due to no fault of his own. Thecircumstances of this case do not require us to determinewhether a defendant could use a motion under $ 2255 to chal532US2 Unit: $U45 [09-06-02 12:45:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN384 DANIELS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtlenge a federal sentence based on such a conviction.2 Cf.,e. g., 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 (1994 ed., Supp. V) (allowing a secondor successive $ 2255 motion if there is "newly discovered evi-dence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence asa whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convinc-ing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have foundthe movant guilty of the offense"); ibid. (tolling 1-year limita-tion period while movant is prevented from making a $ 2255motion by an "impediment . . . created by governmental ac-tion in violation of the Constitution or laws of the UnitedStates"). IIINo such claim is made here. The sole basis on which peti-tioner Daniels challenges his current federal sentence is thattwo of his prior state convictions were the products of in-adequate guilty pleas and ineffective assistance of counsel.Petitioner could have pursued his claims while he was in cus-tody on those convictions. As his counsel conceded at oralargument, there is no indication that petitioner did so or thathe was prevented from doing so by some external force.Tr. of Oral Arg. 3-4, 6.Petitioner's federal sentence was properly enhanced pursuant to the ACCA based on his four facially valid prior stateconvictions. Because petitioner failed to pursue remediesthat were otherwise available to him to challenge his 1978and 1981 convictions, he may not now use a $ 2255 motion tocollaterally attack those convictions. The judgment of theUnited States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit istherefore affirmed. It is so ordered.2 After comparing the text of $$ 2254 and 2255, Justice Scalia concludes that "Congress did not expect challenges to state convictions (usedto enhance federal convictions) to be brought under $ 2255." Post, at 386(opinion concurring in part). This is, of course, true. But it is also besidethe point, as the subject of the $ 2255 motion in this circumstance is theenhanced federal sentence, not the prior state conviction.532US2 Unit: $U45 [09-06-02 12:45:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN385Cite as: 532 U. S. 374 (2001)Scalia, J., concurring in partJustice Scalia, concurring in part.I agree with the Court that 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 (1994 ed.,Supp. V) does not (with theGideon exception, see Gideonv. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963)) permit inquiry intowhether a conviction later used to enhance a federal sentencewas unconstitutionally obtained, and I agree with the Court'sreasoning so far as it goes. I have another reason for reach-ing that result, however, and one that prevents me from joining that portion of the Court's opinion which speculates that"[t]here may be rare circumstances in which $ 2255 would beavailable," such as when "no channel of review was actuallyavailable to a defendant with respect to a prior conviction,due to no fault of his own," ante, at 376, 383. Simply put,"the text of $ 2255 is"not "broad enough to cover a claim thatan enhanced federal sentence violates due process," ante, at383, if the enhancement is based on prior convictions.In addition to the practical reasonsJustice O'Connoridentifies as counseling against petitioner's interpretation of$ 2255, there stands the very text of that provision. "[W]ehave long recognized that `the power to award the writ [ofhabeas corpus] by any of the courts of the United States,must be given by written law,' " Felker v. Turpin, 518 U. S.651, 664 (1996), quoting Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, 94(1807). Section 2255 authorizes a challenge by "[a] prisonerin custody under sentence of a court established by Act ofCongress claiming the right to be released upon the groundthat the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitu-tion or laws of the United States." (Emphases added.) Wehave already determined, in Custis v. United States, 511U. S. 485 (1994), that a sentencing court does not violate theDue Process Clause by imposing a sentence enhanced byprior, purportedly tainted, convictions, unless the taint is theresult of a Gideon violation.* It follows ineluctably that*Justice Souter asserts that Custis "merely held (with [the] exception[of Gideon violations]) that neither the ACCA nor the Constitution provides a forum at the sentencing hearing for challenges to the underlying532US2 Unit: $U45 [09-06-02 12:45:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN386 DANIELS v. UNITED STATESScalia, J., concurring in part$ 2255 does not establish any right to challenge federal sentences based on their enhancement by stale, non-Gideontainted, convictions.This conclusion is reinforced (if reinforcement is possible)by comparing the text of $ 2255 with that of $ 2254. Thelatter, governing habeas challenges to state convictions, provides that "[t]he ineffectiveness or incompetence of counselduring Federal or State collateral postconviction proceedingsshall not be a ground for relief in a proceeding arising under$ 2254." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(i) (1994 ed., Supp. V). There isno conceivable reason why this bar would be placed uponchallenges to state convictions under $ 2254, but not uponchallenges to state convictions under $ 2255. Congress didnot expect challenges to state convictions (used to enhancefederal convictions) to be brought under $ 2255.Perhaps precepts of fundamental fairness inherent in "dueprocess" suggest that a forum to litigate challenges like petitioner's must be made available somewhere for the odd casein which the challenge could not have been brought earlier.But it would not follow from this that federal sentencingmust provide the remedy; much less that federal sentencingneed not provide the remedy but $ 2255 (which is entirelydependent upon the impropriety of prior federal sentencing)conviction." Post, at 388, n. 1 (dissenting opinion). But the Constitutionwould "provide a forum" at the sentencing hearing if it were unconstitutional to sentence on the basis of invalid but nonetheless outstanding priorconvictions. (Assuredly the Constitution does not permit unconstitutional acts.) Custis necessarily held, therefore, that it is not unconstitutional (with the Gideon exception) to sentence on the basis of invalid butnonetheless outstanding prior convictions. Justice Souter apparentlyunderstood this at the time Custis was decided. His dissent began: "TheCourt answers a difficult constitutional question that I believe the underlying statute does not pose," 511 U. S., at 498, which question turns outto be "whether the Constitution permits courts to enhance a defendant'ssentence on the basis of a prior conviction the defendant can show wasobtained in violation of his right to effective assistance of counsel," id.,at 505.532US2 Unit: $U45 [09-06-02 12:45:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN387Cite as: 532 U. S. 374 (2001)Souter, J., dissentingmust do so. Fundamental fairness could be achieved just aswell--indeed, better--by holding that the rendering jurisdiction must provide a means for challenge when enhancementis threatened or has been imposed. Such a constitutionalrule, combined with a rule that any sentence already im-posed must be adjusted accordingly, would prevent sentencing hearings from being routinely complicated by inquiriesinto prior convictions, and would locate those inquirieswhere they can best be conducted: in the rendering jurisdiction. It would also avoid a possible gap in protection thatwould result from using $ 2255 (and in state-court cases,$ 2254) for this inappropriate purpose--arising from the factthat, as discussed above, $ 2254cannot be used to remedyineffective assistance of postconviction counsel. (We haveleft open the question whether such ineffective assistancecan establish a constitutional violation, see Coleman v.Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 755 (1991).) But $ 2255 cannot possibly be the means of relief.For these reasons, I join the opinion of the Court onlyin part.Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens andJustice Ginsburg join, dissenting.In Custis v. United States, 511 U. S. 485 (1994), we heldthat a federal defendant facing an enhanced sentence on thebasis of prior state convictions under the Armed CareerCriminal Act of 1984 (ACCA), 18 U. S. C. $ 924(e), could not,with one exception, challenge the constitutionality of the underlying state convictions at his federal sentencing proceeding. Custis was thus a precursor of the case before us now;Custis is not, however, compelling authority for today's disposition. Although the Court's opinion in Custis struck meas portending more than it strictly held, a reading of the casefree of portent was in fact the understanding of one Memberof the Custis majority: "Custis presented a forum question.The issue was where, not whether, the defendant could attack532US2 Unit: $U45 [09-06-02 12:45:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN388 DANIELS v. UNITED STATESSouter, J., dissentinga prior conviction for constitutional infirmity." Nichols v.United States, 511 U. S. 738, 765 (1994) (Ginsburg, J., dis-senting) (emphasis in original). The door inCustis re-mained open to an attack on the prior state convictions,through a state or federal habeas challenge to the underlyingconvictions themselves. SeeCustis, supra, at 497 (Custis"was still `in custody' for purposes of his state convictions atthe time of his federal sentencing under $ 924(e)," and couldthus "attack his state sentences in Maryland or through federal habeas review"). This case presents the distinct ques-tion of what happens when that door has been closed.The Court's reasons for reading 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 (1994 ed.,Supp. V) as restrictively as it read the ACCA sentencingprovisions have nothing to do either with the text of $ 2255or with any extension of rules governing habeas review ofstate convictions under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 (1994 ed. and Supp.V). The language of $ 2255 providing a federal prisonerwith the right to relief because a sentence "was imposed inviolation of the Constitution or laws of the United States" isobviously broad enough to include a claim that a prior conviction used anew to mandate sentence enhancement under theACCA was obtained unconstitutionally, so that the new sentence itself violates the terms of the ACCA or the Constitu-tion.1 Nor does the Court rest its exclusion of such claims1 The Government argues, citing Custis v. United States, 511 U. S. 485(1994), that 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 (1994 ed., Supp. V) does not provide a remedyhere because "the Constitution is not violated when a conviction that isfacially valid is used to enhance a sentence for committing another crime."Brief for United States 12. This misstates the holding of Custis, whichmerely held (with one exception discussed below) that neither the ACCAnor the Constitution provides a forum at the sentencing hearing for challenges to the underlying conviction. 511 U. S., at 487. The constitutionalholding was necessarily limited to the statutory scheme considered. And,in any event, $ 2255 provides an explicit remedy for a sentence that violates federal law, not solely the Constitution. Cf. Hill v. United States,368 U. S. 424, 428 (1962) (describing types of fundamental errors that are532US2 Unit: $U45 [09-06-02 12:45:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN389Cite as: 532 U. S. 374 (2001)Souter, J., dissentingfrom $ 2255 review on the theory that a $ 2255 petitioner whochallenges underlying state convictions should be required,like a $ 2254 petitioner, to exhaust state remedies and to comply with state procedural rules. Cf. 28 U. S. C. $$ 2254(b)-(c)(1994 ed. and Supp. V); Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509 (1982);Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991). It is not clear,after all, that such requirements, premised largely on comityconcerns and the State's interest in the finality of its ownjudgments, see, e. g., id., at 731-732, 750, should be importedinto this context of a federal sentence imposed when a petitioner who has completed his state sentence seeks only toavoid a sentence enhancement under federal law. In anyevent, the Court does not purport to apply these specific requirements (which in the $ 2254 setting can be waived by theState, see 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. V); Gray v.Netherland, 518 U. S. 152, 165-166 (1996), and which are subject to explicit exceptions). Instead it imposes a flat ban on$ 2255 relief (subject, maybe, to narrow exceptions).2Having no textual basis or related precedent in habeas law,the Court rules out challenges to ACCA sentencing predicates under $ 2255 on the same grounds invoked earlier tobar such challenges under the sentencing provisions of thecognizable under $ 2255). Neither the Custis Court nor today's Courttakes the position that the ACCA properly applies, as a statutory matter,to underlying sentences that are in fact invalid. See Custis, supra, at497; ante, at 382. The language of $ 2255 invites a petitioner to establishsuch a statutory violation.2 The Court continues to leave the door open (but with no promises) toa motion to revise an ACCA sentence if a defendant has first obtained anorder vacating the predicate conviction through a state collateral proceeding or federal habeas review of the state judgment under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(1994 ed. and Supp. V). See ante, at 382; Custis, supra, at 497. Theplurality adds the possibility of an exception to today's rule if a petitionercan show newly discovered evidence or legal disability during the periodof state custody. See ante, at 383-384. These exceptions will not eclipsethe rule.532US2 Unit: $U45 [09-06-02 12:45:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN390 DANIELS v. UNITED STATESSouter, J., dissentingACCA itself: the ACCA ought to be easy to administer andstate convictions ought to carry finality, ante, at 378-380.But whatever force these reasons might have if alternativeavenues of challenge were open, they do not even come closeto the horsepower needed to rule out the application of $ 2255when the choice is relief under $ 2255 or no relief at all.Why should it be easy to subject a person to a higher sentencing range and commit him for nearly nine extra years(as here) when the prisoner has a colorable claim that theextended commitment rests on a conviction the Constitutionwould condemn? If the answer is the value of finality instate convictions, why is finality valuable when state law itself does not demand it, and why is finality a one-way street?Why should a prisoner like Daniels suddenly be barred fromreturning to challenge the validity of a conviction, when theGovernment is free to reach back to it to impose extendedimprisonment under a sentence enhancement law unheard ofat the time of the earlier convictions (1978 and 1981 in thiscase)? Daniels could not have been expected in 1978 to anticipate the federal enhancement statute enacted in 1984; andeven if he had been blessed with statutory clairvoyance, thepractice in 1978 would have told him he could challenge theconvictions when and if the Government sought to rely onthem under the future enhancement statute. The ACCAwas enacted against the backdrop of a pervasive federalpractice of entertaining constitutional challenges to priorconvictions when used anew for sentence enhancement, apractice on which Congress threw no cold water when itenacted the ACCA. See Custis, 511 U. S., at 499-501 (Souter, J., dissenting). Indeed, even the Court seems to findsomething disquieting in the historical practice, as it showsby recognizing a textually untethered exception to its ownrule, one allowing for collateral attacks on prior convictionsif based on violations of the right to counsel under Gideon v.Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963). See ante, at 382. I sup532US2 Unit: $U45 [09-06-02 12:45:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN391Cite as: 532 U. S. 374 (2001)Souter, J., dissentingpose I should not begrudge the Court's concession, but theGideon exception, first announced in Custis, is inexplicablehere. One might have argued in Custis that a Gideon violation was egregious enough to excuse the defendant's failureto resort to other forums still open; but there is no excusefor picking and choosing among constitutional violationshere, when other forums are closed. The need to addressGideon is no reason to ignore Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U. S.86 (1923), or Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U. S. 103 (1935) (percuriam), or Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278 (1936), orStrickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), or Mirandav. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), or Brady v. Maryland, 373U. S. 83 (1963), or any other recognized violations of theConstitution.None of this is to say that the Court is wrong to recognizethat collateral review of old state convictions can be verycumbersome. See ante, at 379. But that is not the onlypractical consideration in the real world we confront (orought to confront) here. A defendant under the ACCA hasgenerally paid whatever penalty the old conviction entailed;he may well have forgone direct challenge because the penalty was not practically worth challenging, and may wellhave passed up collateral attack because he had no counselto speak for him. But when faced with the ACCA's 15-yearmandatory minimum the old conviction is suddenly wellworth challenging and counsel may be available under 18U. S. C. $ 3006A(a)(2)(B). In denying him any right to attackconvictions later when attacks are worth the trouble, theCourt adopts a policy of promoting challenges earlier whenthey may not justify the effort and perhaps never will. Thatis a very odd incentive for a court to create, and the eccentricity is hardly softened by the likelihood that most defendants will not notice before it is too late.Today's decision is devoid of support in either statutorylanguage or congressional intention. I respectfully dissent.532US2 Unit: $U45 [09-06-02 12:45:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN392 DANIELS v. UNITED STATESBreyer, J., dissentingJustice Breyer, dissenting.I believe that Congress intended courts to read the si-lences in federal sentencing statutes as permitting defendants to challenge the validity of an earlier sentence-enhancing convictionat the time of sentencing. See UnitedStates v. Paleo, 967 F. 2d 7, 11-13 (CA1 1992), implicitly overruled by Custis v. United States, 511 U. S. 485 (1994). Thatwas the practice typically followed in the lower courts beforeCustis. See id., at 498-499, and n. 2, 511 (Souter, J., dis-senting). The courts now follow a comparable practicein respect to other sentence-enhancing factors. See, e. g.,United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U. S. 87, 95-97 (1993) (per-jured testimony enhancement). And, given appropriateburden of proof rules, see, e. g., United States v. Gilbert, 20F. 3d 94, 100 (CA3 1994); United States v. Wicks, 995 F. 2d964, 978 (CA10), cert. denied, 510 U. S. 982 (1993); Paleo,supra, at 13 (citing United States v. Henry, 933 F. 2d 553,559 (CA7 1991), cert. denied, 503 U. S. 997 (1992); UnitedStates v. Gallman, 907 F. 2d 639, 643 (CA7 1990), cert. denied, 499 U. S. 908 (1991); and United States v. Taylor, 882F. 2d 1018, 1031 (CA6 1989), cert. denied, 496 U. S. 907(1990)), that practice need not prove unusually burdensome,see Custis, supra, at 511 (Souter, J., dissenting).Having rejected that procedural approach inCustis,supra, at 496-497, the Court now must face the alternative--a later challenge to the earlier convictions in a collateral proceeding that attacks the present conviction or sentence. Toresolve that challenge the plurality has devised a broad ruleimmunizing the earlier conviction with a possible exceptionfor "rare" circumstances. Seeante, at 383. The rule maywell prove unduly "restrictiv[e]," ante, at 388 (Souter, J.,dissenting). Or, through exceptions, it may well bring aboutadditional delay, still greater litigation complexity, and (inso-far as the plurality ties Congress' hands by resting its exception upon constitutional grounds) legal inflexibility. And,given the restrictions Custis placed on sentencing courts, the532US2 Unit: $U45 [09-06-02 12:45:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN393Cite as: 532 U.

Seeante, at 387 (opinion concurring in part).The legal problem lies at the source. While we do notoften overturn a recently decided case, in this instance theCourt's earlier decision will lead to ever-increasing complexity, for it blocks the simpler procedural approach that Con-gress intended.Consequently, I believe this is one of those rare instancesin which the Court should reconsider an earlier case, namely,Custis, and adopt the dissenters' views. For that reason,I dissent.532US2 Unit: $U46 [09-19-02 20:43:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN394 OCTOBER TERM, 2000SyllabusLACKAWANNA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYet al. v. COSScertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuitNo. 99-1884. Argued February 20, 2001--Decided April 25, 2001In 1986, respondent Coss was convicted in Pennsylvania state court ofsimple assault, institutional vandalism, and criminal mischief. Cossfiled a petition for state postconviction relief with respect to these convictions, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, but the Pennsylvaniacourts have never ruled on the petition. In 1990, after Coss had servedthe full sentences for his 1986 convictions, he was convicted in statecourt of aggravated assault. He successfully challenged his 6 to 12 yearsentence on direct appeal. On remand, the court did not consider Coss'1986 convictions in determining his eligible sentencing range. In choosing a sentence within the applicable range, the court considered severalfactors including Coss' extensive criminal record, and reimposed a 6 to12 year sentence. Coss filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,claiming that his 1986 convictions were constitutionally invalid, and thathe was "in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties ofthe United States." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a). The Federal District Courtheld that it could properly exercise $ 2254 jurisdiction because, in sentencing Coss for his 1990 conviction, the sentencing judge made reference to the 1986 convictions. The District Court denied the petitionbecause Coss had not been prejudiced by his 1986 counsel's ineffectiveness. The Third Circuit remanded, agreeing that the District Courthad jurisdiction, but finding a "reasonable probability" that but for hiscounsel's ineffectiveness, Coss would not have been convicted in 1986.Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.204 F. 3d 453, reversed and remanded.Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court with respectto Parts I, II, III-A, and IV, concluding that $ 2254 does not providea remedy when a state prisoner challenges a current sentence onthe ground that it was enhanced based on an allegedly unconstitutionalprior conviction for which the petitioner is no longer in custody.Pp. 401-405, 408.(a) A $ 2254 petitioner must first show that he is "in custody pursuantto the judgment of a State court." $ 2254(a). Because Coss is nolonger serving the sentences for his 1986 convictions, he cannot bring afederal habeas action directed solely at those convictions. However, his532US2 Unit: $U46 [09-19-02 20:43:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN395Cite as: 532 U. S. 394 (2001)Syllabus$ 2254 petition can be (and has been) construed as asserting a challengeto the 1990 sentence he is currently serving, as enhanced by the allegedly invalid 1986 convictions. See Maleng v. Cook, 490 U. S. 488, 493.Thus, he satisfies $ 2254's "in custody" requirement. Pp. 401-402.(b) The more important question here is the one left unanswered inMaleng: the extent to which a prior expired conviction may be subjectto challenge in an attack upon a current sentence it was used to enhance.In Daniels v. United States, ante, p. 374, this Court held that a federalprisoner who has failed to pursue available remedies to challenge a priorconviction (or has done so unsuccessfully) may not collaterally attackthat conviction through a motion under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 directed at theenhanced federal sentence. That holding is now extended to cover$ 2254 petitions directed at enhanced state sentences. The considerations on which the Daniels holding was grounded--finality of convictions and ease of administration--are equally present in the $ 2254 context. See Daniels, ante, at 379-380. Pp. 402-404.(c) As in Daniels, an exception exists to the general rule for $ 2254petitions that challenge an enhanced sentence on the basis that the priorconviction used to enhance the sentence was obtained where there wasa failure to appoint counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment, as setforth in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335. The failure to appointcounsel is a unique constitutional defect, rising to the level of a jurisdictional defect, which therefore warrants special treatment among allegedconstitutional violations. Moreover, an exception for Gideon claimsdoes not implicate this Court's concerns about administrative ease. Aswith any $ 2254 petition, a petitioner making a Gideon challenge mustsatisfy the procedural prerequisites for relief, including exhaustion ofremedies.

By the age of 16, he had been adjudged a juveniledelinquent on five separate occasions for offenses includingtheft, disorderly conduct, assault, and burglary. See RecordDoc. No. 101 (Pl. Exh. 5, pp. 4-6). By the time he turned23, Coss had been convicted in adult court of assault, institutional vandalism, criminal mischief, disorderly conduct, andpossession of a controlled substance. Seeid., at 6-7. Hisrecord also reveals arrests for assault, making terroristicthreats, delivery of controlled substances, reckless endanger-ment, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, retail theft, andcriminal conspiracy, although each of those charges was laterdropped. Seeibid. A report generated by the Lacka-wanna County Adult Probation Office sums up the "one consistent factor in this defendant's life: criminal behavior, muchof it being aggressive." Id., at 8.This case revolves around two of the many entries on Coss'criminal record. In October 1986, Coss was convicted inPennsylvania state court of simple assault, institutional van-dalism, and criminal mischief. He was then sentenced totwo consecutive prison terms of six months to one year. Hedid not file a direct appeal. See App. 54a; see also Tr. ofOral Arg. 28-29.In June 1987, Coss filed a petition for relief from the 1986convictions under the Pennsylvania Post Conviction ReliefAct, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 9541et seq. (1998), alleging that histrial attorney had been constitutionally ineffective. SeeApp. 50a-53a. The Lackawanna County Court of CommonPleas promptly appointed counsel for Coss, id., at 57a, andthe district attorney filed an answer to the petition, id., at59a. The court, however, took no further action on the petition for the remainder of Coss' time in custody. Indeed, itappears that Coss' state postconviction petition has now532US2 Unit: $U46 [09-19-02 20:43:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN398 LACKAWANNA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY v. COSSOpinion of the Courtbeen pending for almost 14 years, and has never been thesubject of a judicial ruling. Neither petitioners nor respondent is able to explain this lapse. Tr. of Oral Arg. 4, 29.In 1990, after he had served the full sentences for his 1986convictions, Coss was again convicted in Pennsylvania statecourt, this time of aggravated assault. He was sentenced to6 to 12 years in prison, but successfully challenged this sentence on direct appeal because of a possible inaccuracy in thepresentence report. App. 62a.On remand, the court's first task was to determine therange of sentences for which Coss was eligible. In calculating Coss' "prior record score"--one of two determinants ofthe applicable sentencing range, see 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 9721(1998) (reproducing 204 Pa. Code $ 303.9(a) (1998))--the newpresentence report took account of Coss' most serious juvenile adjudication and Coss' 1986 misdemeanor convictions,counting the latter as separate offenses. See Record Doc.No. 101 (Pl. Exh. 3, at 10). Coss objected, claiming that his1986 convictions should be counted as one misdemeanor offense because they arose from the same transaction. Seeibid. (Pl. Exh. 5, at 3-4). The trial court sustained Coss'objection, finding that the convictions should be "view[ed] . . .as being one transaction, one incident, one conviction." Id.,at 5. Under the Pennsylvania Sentencing Guidelines, oneprior misdemeanor does not affect the prior record score.See id., at 10 (displaying grid for calculating prior recordscore). Thus, the practical effect of the court's decision wasto eliminate the 1986 convictions from Coss' prior recordscore entirely. See ibid.; see also 204 F. 3d 453, 467-468(CA3 2000) (en banc) (Nygaard, J., dissenting). Consequently, Coss' 1986 convictions played no part in determiningthe range of sentences to which Coss was exposed.The court's next task was to choose a sentence within thatrange. In doing so, the trial court considered a number offactors, including "the seriousness and nature of the crimeinvolved here, the well being and protection of the people532US2 Unit: $U46 [09-19-02 20:43:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN399Cite as: 532 U.

Record Doc. No. 101(Pl. Exh. 3, at 26). The court concluded that "it's indicativethat from your actions that you will continue to break thelaw unless given a period of incarceration." Ibid. Thecourt then reimposed a 6 to 12 year sentence. BecauseCoss' 1986 convictions are a part of his prior criminal record,the Court of Appeals concluded that the state court tookthose convictions "into consideration" in sentencing Coss.See 204 F. 3d, at 459.In September 1994, Coss filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. Thatprovision, a postconviction remedy in federal court for stateprisoners, provides that a writ of habeas corpus is availableto "a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a Statecourt" if that person "is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States." $ 2254(a).In his petition, Coss contended that his 1986 assault conviction was the product of ineffective assistance of counsel.App. 73a-74a.In answer to Coss' $ 2254 petition, the Lackawanna CountyDistrict Attorney argued that the District Court could notreview the constitutionality of Coss' 1986 convictions because Coss was no longer in custody on those convictions.Record Doc. No. 55, p. 2. The district attorney, however,indicated his understanding that the crux of Coss' claim wasthat his 1986 convictions "may have impact [sic] upon thesentences which have been imposed . . . upon [Coss] for criminal convictions rendered against him" for his 1990 convictions. Ibid. See also Brief for Petitioners 4 ("[R]espondentargues that the sentence for his 1990 conviction was adversely and unconstitutionally affected by the 1986 simpleassault conviction").532US2 Unit: $U46 [09-19-02 20:43:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN400 LACKAWANNA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY v. COSSOpinion of the CourtThe District Court stated that Coss was arguing "that hiscurrent sentence [for the 1990 conviction] was adversely affected by the 1986 convictions because the sentencing judgeconsidered these allegedly unconstitutional convictions incomputing Coss's present sentence." App. to Pet. for Cert.105a-106a. Finding that "the sentencing judge . . . did makereference to the 1986 convictions in sentencing Coss," id., at107a, the court held that it could properly exercise jurisdic-tion under $ 2254,id., at 108a; see also Record Doc. No. 87,p. 3, n. 2. After an evidentiary hearing, the court deniedthe petition, holding that Coss' 1986 trial counsel had beenineffective, but that Coss had not been prejudiced by theineffectiveness. App. to Pet. for Cert. 113a, 116a, 120a.The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, sitting en banc,agreed that "the sentencing court for the 1990 convictiontook into consideration [Coss' 1986] conviction[s]," and therefore that the District Court had jurisdiction over Coss' $ 2254petition. 204 F. 3d, at 459. Citing Circuit precedent andour decisions in Maleng v. Cook, 490 U. S. 488 (1989) (percuriam), and United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443 (1972),the court concluded that $ 2254 provided a remedy for "anallegedly unconstitutional conviction, even if [the $ 2254 petitioner] has served in entirety the sentence resulting fromthe conviction, if that conviction had an effect on a presentsentence." 204 F. 3d, at 459-460.The court then found that Coss had received ineffectiveassistance during his 1986 trial, and that there was "a reasonable probability" that but for the ineffective assistance,Coss "would not have been found guilty of assau[lt]." Id.,at 462. The court remanded the case to the District Court,ordering that the Commonwealth be allowed either to retryCoss for the 1986 assault or to resentence him for the 1990assault without consideration of the 1986 conviction.

S. 923 (2000).IIAThe first showing a $ 2254 petitioner must make is that heis "in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court."28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a). In Maleng v. Cook, supra, we consid-ered a situation quite similar to the one presented here. Inthat case, the respondent had filed a $ 2254 petition listing asthe " `conviction under attack' " a 1958 state conviction forwhich he had already served the entirety of his sentence.490 U. S., at 489-490. He also alleged that the 1958 conviction had been "used illegally to enhance his 1978 state sen-tences" which he had not yet begun to serve because he wasat that time in federal custody on an unrelated matter. Ibid.We determined that the respondent was "in custody" on his1978 sentences because the State had lodged a detaineragainst him with the federal authorities. Id., at 493.We held that the respondent was not "in custody" on his1958 conviction merely because that conviction had beenused to enhance a subsequent sentence. Id., at 492. Weacknowledged, however, that because his $ 2254 petition"[could] be read as asserting a challenge to the 1978 sen-tences, as enhanced by the allegedly invalid prior conviction,. . . respondent . . . satisfied the `in custody' requirement forfederal habeas jurisdiction."Id., at 493-494.Similarly, Coss is no longer serving the sentences imposedpursuant to his 1986 convictions, and therefore cannot bringa federal habeas petition directed solely at those convictions.Coss is, however, currently serving the sentence for his 1990conviction. Like the respondent in Maleng, Coss' $ 2254petition can be (and has been) construed as "asserting achallenge to the [1990] senten[ce], as enhanced by the alleg532US2 Unit: $U46 [09-19-02 20:43:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN402 LACKAWANNA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY v. COSSOpinion of the Courtedly invalid prior [1986] conviction." Id., at 493. See alsosupra, at 399-400. Accordingly, Coss satisfies $ 2254's "incustody" requirement. Cf. Daniels, ante, at 383, 384, n. 2(stating that the text of $ 2255, which also contains an "incustody" requirement, is broad enough to cover a claim thata current sentence enhanced by an allegedly unconstitutionalprior conviction violates due process).BMore important for our purposes here is the question weexplicitly left unanswered inMaleng: "the extent to whichthe [prior expired] conviction itself may be subject to challenge in the attack upon the [current] senten[ce] which it wasused to enhance." 490 U. S., at 494. We encountered thissame question in the $ 2255 context in Daniels v. UnitedStates, ante, p. 374. We held there that "[i]f . . . a priorconviction used to enhance a federal sentence is no longeropen to direct or collateral attack in its own right becausethe defendant failed to pursue those remedies while theywere available (or because the defendant did so unsuccess-fully), then that defendant . . . may not collaterally attack hisprior conviction through a motion under $ 2255." Ante, at382. We now extend this holding to cover $ 2254 petitionsdirected at enhanced state sentences.We grounded our holding inDaniels on considerationsrelating to the need for finality of convictions and ease ofadministration. Those concerns are equally present in the$ 2254 context. The first and most compelling interest isin the finality of convictions. Once a judgment of convictionis entered in state court, it is subject to review in multipleforums. Specifically, each State has created mechanismsfor both direct appeal and state postconviction review,see L. Yackle, Postconviction Remedies $$ 1, 13 (1981 andSupp. 2000), even though there is no constitutional mandatethat they do so, see Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551,557 (1987) (no constitutional right to state postconviction532US2 Unit: $U46 [09-19-02 20:43:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN403Cite as: 532 U. S. 394 (2001)Opinion of the Courtreview); Abney v. United States, 431 U. S. 651, 656 (1977)(no constitutional right to direct appeal). Moreover, $ 2254makes federal courts available to review state criminalproceedings for compliance with federal constitutionalmandates.As we said inDaniels, "[t]hese vehicles for review . . . arenot available indefinitely and without limitation." Ante, at381. A defendant may choose not to seek review of his con-viction within the prescribed time. Or he may seek reviewand not prevail, either because he did not comply with proce-dural rules or because he failed to prove a constitutional violation. In each of these situations, the defendant's conviction becomes final and the State that secured the convictionobtains a strong interest in preserving the integrity of thejudgment. See ante, at 379-380. Other jurisdictions acquire an interest as well, as they may then use that conviction for their own recidivist sentencing purposes, relying on"the `presumption of regularity' that attaches to final judgments." Parke v. Raley, 506 U. S. 20, 29 (1992); see alsoDaniels, ante, at 380.An additional concern is ease of administration of challenges to expired state convictions. Federal courts sittingin habeas jurisdiction must consult state court records andtranscripts to ensure that challenged convictions were obtained in a manner consistent with constitutional demands.As time passes, and certainly once a state sentence has beenserved to completion, the likelihood that trial records will beretained by the local courts and will be accessible for reviewdiminishes substantially. See Daniels, ante, at 379.Accordingly, as in Daniels, we hold that once a state conviction is no longer open to direct or collateral attack in itsown right because the defendant failed to pursue those remedies while they were available (or because the defendant didso unsuccessfully), the conviction may be regarded as conclusively valid. See Daniels, ante, at 382. If that convictionis later used to enhance a criminal sentence, the defendant532US2 Unit: $U46 [09-19-02 20:43:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN404 LACKAWANNA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY v. COSSOpinion of the Courtgenerally may not challenge the enhanced sentence througha petition under $ 2254 on the ground that the prior conviction was unconstitutionally obtained.IIIAAs in Daniels, we recognize an exception to the generalrule for $ 2254 petitions that challenge an enhanced sentenceon the basis that the prior conviction used to enhance thesentence was obtained where there was a failure to appointcounsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment, as set forth inGideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963). The special sta-tus of Gideon claims in this context is well established in ourcase law. See, e. g., Custis v. United States, 511 U. S. 485,496-497 (1994); United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S., at 449;Burgett v. Texas, 389 U. S. 109, 115 (1967). Cf. Daniels,ante, at 382.As we recognized in Custis, the "failure to appoint counselfor an indigent [is] a unique constitutional defect . . . ris[ing]to the level of a jurisdictional defect," which thereforewarrants special treatment among alleged constitutionalviolations. See 511 U. S., at 496. Moreover, allowing anexception for Gideon challenges does not implicate our concern about administrative ease, as the "failure to appointcounsel . . . will generally appear from the judgment rollitself, or from an accompanying minute order." 511 U. S.,at 496.As with any $ 2254 petition, the petitioner must satisfy theprocedural prerequisites for relief including, for example,exhaustion of remedies. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b) (1994 ed.,Supp. V). When an otherwise qualified $ 2254 petitioner candemonstrate that his current sentence was enhanced on thebasis of a prior conviction that was obtained where therewas a failure to appoint counsel in violation of the SixthAmendment, the current sentence cannot stand and habeasrelief is appropriate. Cf. United States v. Tucker, supra, at532US2 Unit: $U46 [09-19-02 20:43:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN405Cite as: 532 U. S. 394 (2001)Opinion of O'Connor, J.449 (affirming vacatur of sentence that was based in part onprior uncounseled state convictions).BWe stated in Daniels that another exception to the generalrule precluding habeas relief might be available, althoughthe circumstances of that case did not require us to resolvethe issue. See ante, at 383-384. We note a similar situation here.The general rule we have adopted here and in Danielsreflects the notion that a defendant properly bears the conse-quences of either forgoing otherwise available review of aconviction or failing to successfully demonstrate constitu-tional error. Seesupra, at 403-404; Daniels, ante, at 381-383. It is not always the case, however, that a defendantcan be faulted for failing to obtain timely review of a consti-tutional claim. For example, a state court may, without justification, refuse to rule on a constitutional claim that hasbeen properly presented to it. Cf. 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d)(1)(B)(1994 ed., Supp. V) (tolling 1-year limitations period whilepetitioner is prevented from filing application by an "impediment . . . created by State action in violation of the Constitu-tion or laws of the United States"). Alternatively, after thetime for direct or collateral review has expired, a defendantmay obtain compelling evidence that he is actually innocentof the crime for which he was convicted, and which he couldnot have uncovered in a timely manner. Cf.Brady v. Mary-land, 373 U. S. 83 (1963); 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b)(2)(B) (1994 ed.,Supp. V) (allowing a second or successive habeas corpus ap-plication if "the factual predicate for the claim could nothave been discovered previously through the exercise of duediligence; and . . . the facts underlying the claim, if provenand viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would besufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that,but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder wouldhave found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense").532US2 Unit: $U46 [09-19-02 20:43:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN406 LACKAWANNA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY v. COSSOpinion of O'Connor, J.In such situations, a habeas petition directed at the en-hanced sentence may effectively be the first and only forumavailable for review of the prior conviction. As in Daniels,this case does not require us to determine whether, or underwhat precise circumstances, a petitioner might be able to usea $ 2254 petition in this manner.Whatever such a petitioner must show to be eligible forreview, the challenged prior conviction must have adverselyaffected the sentence that is the subject of the habeas peti-tion. This question was adequately raised and consideredbelow. As the District Court stated, Coss contended "thathis current sentence [for the 1990 conviction] wasadverselyaffected by the 1986 convictions because the sentencingjudge considered these allegedly unconstitutional convictionsin computing Coss's present sentence." App. to Pet. forCert. 105a-106a (emphasis added). The District Court andmajority of the Court of Appeals agreed with Coss on thispoint. See id., at 107a; 204 F. 3d, at 459. Judge Nygaard,joined by Judge Roth, dissented to dispute the conclusionthat the 1986 convictions had any effect whatsoever on Coss'sentence for the 1990 conviction.Id., at 467-469.CAfter a careful examination of the record here, we are sat-isfied that the findings of the lower courts on this thresholdfactual point are clearly erroneous. Cf. Neil v. Biggers, 409U. S. 188, 193, n. 3 (1972). We therefore conclude that respondent Coss does not qualify to have his $ 2254 petitionreviewed, even assuming the existence of a limited exceptionto the general rule barring review of an expired prior convic-tion. Specifically, it is clear that any "consideration" thetrial court may have given to Coss' 1986 convictions in reim-posing sentence for his 1990 conviction did not actually affectthat sentence.As we explain above, seesupra, at 398-399, when Cosswas resentenced on his 1990 conviction, he objected to the532US2 Unit: $U46 [09-19-02 20:43:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN407Cite as: 532 U. S. 394 (2001)Opinion of O'Connor, J.presentence report's calculation of his prior record score.The court sustained that objection and, in effect, eliminatedCoss' 1986 convictions from the prior record score entirely.Because the prior record score is one of two determinants ofthe applicable sentencing range, see 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 9721(1998) (reproducing 204 Pa. Code $ 303.9(a) (1998)), it is clearthat Coss' 1986 convictions had no role in determining therange of sentences to which Coss was exposed.In choosing a sentence for Coss within that range, the trialcourt considered several factors, including "the seriousnessand nature of the crime involved here, the well being andprotection of the people who live in our community, yourcriminal disposition, your prior criminal record, the possibility of your rehabilitation, and the testimony that I've heard."Record Doc. No. 101 (Pl. Exh. 3, at 26). Coss' 1986 convictions are, of course, a portion of his criminal record. Thus,it is technically correct to say that the court "considered"those convictions before sentencing Coss. Cf. 204 F. 3d,at 459.But it is a different thing entirely to say that the 1986convictions actually increased the length of the sentence thecourt ultimately imposed. As the sentencing court toldCoss, "I think that it's indicative that from your actions thatyou will continue to break the law unless given a period ofincarceration." Record Doc. No. 101 (Pl. Exh. 3, at 26).The "actions" to which the judge referred were obviouslynot limited to Coss' criminal conduct in 1986, but Coss' extensive and violent criminal record as a whole. We conclude, as Judge Nygaard did below, that the 1986 convictionsare "such a minor component of [Coss'] record that there isno question that the sentencing court, given its concerns,would have imposed exactly the same sentence" had thoseconvictions been omitted from Coss' record. 204 F. 3d, at468 (dissenting opinion).We note that the record does not explain why Coss' ineffective assistance claim did not receive a timely adjudication532US2 Unit: $U46 [09-19-02 20:43:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN408 LACKAWANNA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY v. COSSSouter, J., dissentingin the Pennsylvania courts. While the reason might havebeen that Coss' petition "slipped through the cracks," due tono fault of his own, Tr. of Oral Arg. 4, it might also havebeen that Coss was responsible for "request[ing] that thematter be brought up for a hearing," id., at 5. But even ifCoss cannot be faulted for that lapse, he would not qualifyto have his current $ 2254 petition reviewed because the 1990sentence he is challenging was not actually affected by the1986 convictions.IVThe judgment of the United States Court of Appeals forthe Third Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
