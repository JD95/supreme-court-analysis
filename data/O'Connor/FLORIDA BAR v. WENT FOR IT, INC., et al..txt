Rules of the Florida Bar prohibit personal injury lawyersfrom sending targeted direct-mail solicitations to victims andtheir relatives for 30 days following an accident or disaster.This case asks us to consider whether such Rules violate theFirst and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. Wehold that in the circumstances presented here, they do not.IIn 1989, the Florida Bar (Bar) completed a 2-year study ofthe effects of lawyer advertising on public opinion. Afterconducting hearings, commissioning surveys, and reviewingextensive public commentary, the Bar determined that several changes to its advertising rules were in order. In late1990, the Florida Supreme Court adopted the Bar's proposedamendments with some modifications. The Florida Bar:Petition to Amend the Rules Regulating the Florida Bar--Advertising Issues, 571 So. 2d 451 (Fla. 1990). Two of theseamendments are at issue in this case. Rule 4-7.4(b)(1) provides that "[a] lawyer shall not send, or knowingly permit tobe sent, . . . a written communication to a prospective clientfor the purpose of obtaining professional employment if: (A)the written communication concerns an action for personalinjury or wrongful death or otherwise relates to an accidentor disaster involving the person to whom the communicationis addressed or a relative of that person, unless the accidentor disaster occurred more than 30 days prior to the mailingof the communication." Rule 4-7.8(a) states that "[a] lawyershall not accept referrals from a lawyer referral service unless the service: (1) engages in no communication with thepublic and in no direct contact with prospective clients in amanner that would violate the Rules of Professional Conductif the communication or contact were made by the lawyer."Together, these Rules create a brief 30-day blackout periodafter an accident during which lawyers may not, directly or515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT621Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)Opinion of the Courtindirectly, single out accident victims or their relatives inorder to solicit their business.In March 1992, G. Stewart McHenry and his wholly ownedlawyer referral service, Went For It, Inc., filed this actionfor declaratory and injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida challengingRules 4-7.4(b)(1) and 4-7.8(a) as violative of the First andFourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. McHenry alleged that he routinely sent targeted solicitations to accidentvictims or their survivors within 30 days after accidents andthat he wished to continue doing so in the future. Went ForIt, Inc., represented that it wished to contact accident victims or their survivors within 30 days of accidents and torefer potential clients to participating Florida lawyers. InOctober 1992, McHenry was disbarred for reasons unrelatedto this suit, Florida Bar v. McHenry, 605 So. 2d 459 (Fla.1992). Another Florida lawyer, John T. Blakely, was substituted in his stead.The District Court referred the parties' competing summary judgment motions to a Magistrate Judge, who concluded that the Bar had substantial government interests,predicated on a concern for professionalism, both in protecting the personal privacy and tranquility of recent accidentvictims and their relatives and in ensuring that these individuals do not fall prey to undue influence or overreaching.Citing the Bar's extensive study, the Magistrate Judge foundthat the Rules directly serve those interests and sweep nofurther than reasonably necessary. The Magistrate recommended that the District Court grant the Bar's motion forsummary judgment on the ground that the Rules pass constitutional muster.The District Court rejected the Magistrate Judge's reportand recommendations and entered summary judgment forthe plaintiffs, 808 F. Supp. 1543 (MD Fla. 1992), relying onBates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U. S. 350 (1977), and sub515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT622 FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC.Opinion of the Courtsequent cases. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed on similargrounds, McHenry v. Florida Bar, 21 F. 3d 1038 (1994). Thepanel noted, in its conclusion, that it was "disturbed thatBates and its progeny require the decision" that it reached,21 F. 3d, at 1045. We granted certiorari, 512 U. S. 1289(1994), and now reverse.IIAConstitutional protection for attorney advertising, and forcommercial speech generally, is of recent vintage. Until themid-1970's, we adhered to the broad rule laid out in Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U. S. 52, 54 (1942), that, while theFirst Amendment guards against government restriction ofspeech in most contexts, "the Constitution imposes no suchrestraint on government as respects purely commercialadvertising." In 1976, the Court changed course. InVirginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens ConsumerCouncil, Inc., 425 U. S. 748, we invalidated a state statutebarring pharmacists from advertising prescription drugprices. At issue was speech that involved the idea that " `Iwill sell you the X prescription drug at the Y price.' " Id.,at 761. Striking the ban as unconstitutional, we rejectedthe argument that such speech "is so removed from `anyexposition of ideas,' and from `truth, science, morality, andarts in general, in its diffusion of liberal sentiments on theadministration of Government,' that it lacks all protection."Id., at 762 (citations omitted).InVirginia Bd., the Court limited its holding to advertis-ing by pharmacists, noting that "[p]hysicians and lawyers . . .do not dispense standardized products; they render profes-sionalservices of almost infinite variety and nature, with theconsequent enhanced possibility for confusion and deceptionif they were to undertake certain kinds of advertising." Id.,at 773, n. 25 (emphasis in original). One year later, however,the Court applied the Virginia Bd. principles to invalidatea state rule prohibiting lawyers from advertising in news515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT623Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)Opinion of the Courtpapers and other media. In Bates v. State Bar of Arizona,supra, the Court struck a ban on price advertising for whatit deemed "routine" legal services: "the uncontested divorce,the simple adoption, the uncontested personal bankruptcy,the change of name, and the like." 433 U. S., at 372. Expressing confidence that legal advertising would only bepracticable for such simple, standardized services, the Courtrejected the State's proffered justifications for regulation.Nearly two decades of cases have built upon the foundation laid by Bates. It is now well established that lawyeradvertising is commercial speech and, as such, is accorded ameasure of First Amendment protection. See, e. g., Shaperov. Kentucky Bar Assn., 486 U. S. 466, 472 (1988); Zaudererv. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio,471 U. S. 626, 637 (1985); In re R. M. J., 455 U. S. 191, 199(1982). Such First Amendment protection, of course, is notabsolute. We have always been careful to distinguish commercial speech from speech at the First Amendment's core." `[C]ommercial speech [enjoys] a limited measure of protection, commensurate with its subordinate position in the scaleof First Amendment values,' and is subject to `modes ofregulation that might be impermissible in the realm of noncommercial expression.' " Board of Trustees of State Univ.of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 477 (1989), quoting Ohralik v.Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447, 456 (1978). We haveobserved that " `[t]o require a parity of constitutional protection for commercial and noncommercial speech alike couldinvite dilution, simply by a leveling process, of the force ofthe Amendment's guarantee with respect to the latter kindof speech.' " 492 U. S., at 481, quoting Ohralik, supra, at456.Mindful of these concerns, we engage in "intermediate"scrutiny of restrictions on commercial speech, analyzingthem under the framework set forth in Central HudsonGas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S.557 (1980). Under Central Hudson, the government may515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT624 FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC.Opinion of the Courtfreely regulate commercial speech that concerns unlawful ac-tivity or is misleading. Id., at 563-564. Commercial speechthat falls into neither of those categories, like the advertisingat issue here, may be regulated if the government satisfies atest consisting of three related prongs: First, the govern-ment must assert a substantial interest in support of its regulation; second, the government must demonstrate that therestriction on commercial speech directly and materially advances that interest; and third, the regulation must be " `nar-rowly drawn.' "Id., at 564-565.B"Unlike rational basis review, the Central Hudson stand-ard does not permit us to supplant the precise interests putforward by the State with other suppositions," Edenfield v.Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 768 (1993). The Bar asserts that it hasa substantial interest in protecting the privacy and tran-quility of personal injury victims and their loved onesagainst intrusive, unsolicited contact by lawyers. See Brieffor Petitioner 8, 25-27; 21 F. 3d, at 1043-1044.1 This interestobviously factors into the Bar's paramount (and repeatedlyprofessed) objective of curbing activities that "negativelyaffec[t] the administration of justice." The Florida Bar:Petition to Amend the Rules Regulating the Florida Bar--Advertising Issues, 571 So. 2d, at 455; see also Brief forPetitioner 7, 14, 24; 21 F. 3d, at 1043 (describing Bar's effort "to preserve the integrity of the legal profession").1 At prior stages of this litigation, the Bar asserted a different interest,in addition to that urged now, in protecting people against undue influenceand overreaching. See 21 F. 3d, at 1042-1043; cf. Shapero v. KentuckyBar Assn., 486 U. S. 466, 474-476 (1988); Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn.,436 U. S. 447, 462 (1978). Because the Bar does not press this interestbefore us, we do not consider it. Of course, our precedents do not requirethe Bar to point to more than one interest in support of its 30-day restriction; a single substantial interest is sufficient to satisfy Central Hudson'sfirst prong. See Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S. 476, 485 (1995)(deeming only one of the government's proffered interests "substantial").515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT625Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)Opinion of the CourtBecause direct-mail solicitations in the wake of accidents areperceived by the public as intrusive, the Bar argues, the reputation of the legal profession in the eyes of Floridians hassuffered commensurately. See Pet. for Cert. 14-15; Brieffor Petitioner 28-29. The regulation, then, is an effort toprotect the flagging reputations of Florida lawyers by pre-venting them from engaging in conduct that, the Bar maintains, " `is universally regarded as deplorable and beneathcommon decency because of its intrusion upon the specialvulnerability and private grief of victims or their families.' "Brief for Petitioner 28, quotingIn re Anis, 126 N. J. 448, 458,599 A. 2d 1265, 1270 (1992).We have little trouble crediting the Bar's interest as substantial. On various occasions we have accepted the proposition that "States have a compelling interest in the practiceof professions within their boundaries, and . . . as part oftheir power to protect the public health, safety, and othervalid interests they have broad power to establish standardsfor licensing practitioners and regulating the practice of professions." Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U. S. 773, 792(1975); see also Ohralik, supra, at 460; Cohen v. Hurley, 366U. S. 117, 124 (1961). Our precedents also leave no room fordoubt that "the protection of potential clients' privacy is asubstantial state interest." See Edenfield, supra, at 769.In other contexts, we have consistently recognized that"[t]he State's interest in protecting the well-being, tranquility, and privacy of the home is certainly of the highest orderin a free and civilized society." Carey v. Brown, 447 U. S.455, 471 (1980). Indeed, we have noted that "a special benefit of the privacy all citizens enjoy within their own walls,which the State may legislate to protect, is an ability toavoid intrusions." Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 484-485 (1988).Under Central Hudson's second prong, the State mustdemonstrate that the challenged regulation "advances theGovernment's interest `in a direct and material way.' "515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT626 FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC.Opinion of the CourtRubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S. 476, 487 (1995), quotingEdenfield, supra, at 767. That burden, we have explained," `is not satisfied by mere speculation or conjecture; rather,a governmental body seeking to sustain a restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms it recitesare real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them toa material degree.' " 514 U. S., at 487, quotingEdenfield,supra, at 770-771. In Edenfield, the Court invalidated aFlorida ban on in-person solicitation by certified public accountants (CPA's). We observed that the State Board of Ac-countancy had "present[ed] no studies that suggest personalsolicitation of prospective business clients by CPA's createsthe dangers of fraud, overreaching, or compromised independence that the Board claims to fear." 507 U. S., at 771.Moreover, "[t]he record [did] not disclose any anecdotal evidence, either from Florida or another State, that validate[d]the Board's suppositions." Ibid. In fact, we concluded thatthe only evidence in the record tended to "contradic[t], ratherthan strengthe[n], the Board's submissions." Id., at 772.Finding nothing in the record to substantiate the State's allegations of harm, we invalidated the regulation.The direct-mail solicitation regulation before us does notsuffer from such infirmities. The Bar submitted a 106-page summary of its 2-year study of lawyer advertisingand solicitation to the District Court. That summary contains data--both statistical and anecdotal--supporting theBar's contentions that the Florida public views direct-mailsolicitations in the immediate wake of accidents as an intrusion on privacy that reflects poorly upon the profession. Asof June 1989, lawyers mailed 700,000 direct solicitations inFlorida annually, 40% of which were aimed at accident victims or their survivors. Summary of the Record in No.74,987 (Fla.) on Petition to Amend the Rules RegulatingLawyer Advertising (hereinafter Summary of Record), App.H, p. 2. A survey of Florida adults commissioned by theBar indicated that Floridians "have negative feelings about515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT627Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)Opinion of the Courtthose attorneys who use direct mail advertising." MagidAssociates, Attitudes & Opinions Toward Direct Mail Advertising by Attorneys (Dec. 1987), Summary of Record, App.C(4), p. 6. Fifty-four percent of the general population surveyed said that contacting persons concerning accidents orsimilar events is a violation of privacy. Id., at 7. A randomsampling of persons who received direct-mail advertisingfrom lawyers in 1987 revealed that 45% believed that direct-mail solicitation is "designed to take advantage of gullible orunstable people"; 34% found such tactics "annoying or irri-tating"; 26% found it "an invasion of your privacy"; and 24%reported that it "made you angry." Ibid. Significantly,27% of direct-mail recipients reported that their regard forthe legal profession and for the judicial process as a wholewas "lower" as a result of receiving the direct mail. Ibid.The anecdotal record mustered by the Bar is noteworthyfor its breadth and detail. With titles like "Scavenger Lawyers" (The Miami Herald, Sept. 29, 1987) and "Solicitors Outof Bounds" (St. Petersburg Times, Oct. 26, 1987), newspapereditorial pages in Florida have burgeoned with criticism ofFlorida lawyers who send targeted direct mail to victimsshortly after accidents. See Summary of Record, App. B,pp. 1-8 (excerpts from articles); see also Peltz, Legal Advertising--Opening Pandora's Box, 19 Stetson L. Rev. 43, 116(1989) (listing Florida editorials critical of direct-mail solicitation of accident victims in 1987, several of which are referenced in the record). The study summary also includes pageupon page of excerpts from complaints of direct-mail recipients. For example, a Florida citizen described how he was" `appalled and angered by the brazen attempt' " of a law firmto solicit him by letter shortly after he was injured and hisfiancee was killed in an auto accident. Summary of Record,App. I(1), p. 2. Another found it " `despicable and inexcusable' " that a Pensacola lawyer wrote to his mother threedays after his father's funeral. Ibid. Another describedhow she was " `astounded' " and then " `very angry' " when515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT628 FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC.Opinion of the Courtshe received a solicitation following a minor accident. Id.,at 3. Still another described as " `beyond comprehension' "a letter his nephew's family received the day of the nephew'sfuneral.Ibid. One citizen wrote, " `I consider the unsolicited contact from you after my child's accident to be of therankest form of ambulance chasing and in incredibly poortaste. . . . I cannot begin to express with my limited vocabulary the utter contempt in which I hold you and yourkind.' "Ibid.In light of this showing--which respondents at no time re-futed, save by the conclusory assertion that the Rule lacked"any factual basis," Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment and Supplementary Memorandum of Law in No. 92-370-Civ. (MD Fla.), p. 5--we conclude that the Bar has satisfiedthe second prong of the Central Hudson test. In dissent,Justice Kennedy complains that we have before us fewindications of the sample size or selection procedures employed by Magid Associates (a nationally renowned consulting firm) and no copies of the actual surveys employed. Seepost, at 640. As stated, we believe the evidence adducedby the Bar is sufficient to meet the standard elaborated inEdenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761 (1993). In any event, we donot read our case law to require that empirical data cometo us accompanied by a surfeit of background information.Indeed, in other First Amendment contexts, we have permitted litigants to justify speech restrictions by reference tostudies and anecdotes pertaining to different locales altogether, see Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41,50-51 (1986); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S. 560,584-585 (1991) (Souter, J., concurring in judgment), or even,in a case applying strict scrutiny, to justify restrictions basedsolely on history, consensus, and "simple common sense,"Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 211 (1992). Nothing inEdenfield, a case in which the State offered no evidence oranecdotes in support of its restriction, requires more. Afterscouring the record, we are satisfied that the ban on direct515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT629Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)Opinion of the Courtmail solicitation in the immediate aftermath of accidents, un-like the rule at issue inEdenfield, targets a concrete, nonspeculative harm.In reaching a contrary conclusion, the Court of Appealsdetermined that this case was governed squarely by Shaperov. Kentucky Bar Assn., 486 U. S. 466 (1988). Making nomention of the Bar's study, the court concluded that " `a targeted letter [does not] invade the recipient's privacy anymore than does a substantively identical letter mailed atlarge. The invasion, if any, occurs when the lawyer dis-covers the recipient's legal affairs, not when he confronts therecipient with the discovery.' " 21 F. 3d, at 1044, quotingShapero, supra, at 476. In many cases, the Court of Appeals explained, "this invasion of privacy will involve nomore than reading the newspaper." 21 F. 3d, at 1044.While some of Shapero's language might be read to support the Court of Appeals' interpretation, Shapero differs inseveral fundamental respects from the case before us. Firstand foremost, Shapero's treatment of privacy was casual.Contrary to the dissent's suggestions, post, at 637-638, theState in Shapero did not seek to justify its regulation as ameasure undertaken to prevent lawyers' invasions of privacyinterests. See generally Brief for Respondent in Shapero v.Kentucky Bar Assn., O. T. 1987, No. 87-16. Rather, theState focused exclusively on the special dangers of overreaching inhering in targeted solicitations. Ibid. Second,in contrast to this case, Shapero dealt with a broad ban onall direct-mail solicitations, whatever the time frame andwhoever the recipient. Finally, the State in Shapero assembled no evidence attempting to demonstrate any actual harmcaused by targeted direct mail. The Court rejected theState's effort to justify a prophylactic ban on the basis ofblanket, untested assertions of undue influence and overreaching. 486 U. S., at 475. Because the State did notmake a privacy-based argument at all, its empirical showingon that issue was similarly infirm.515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT630 FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC.Opinion of the CourtWe find the Court's perfunctory treatment of privacy inShapero to be of little utility in assessing this ban on targeted solicitation of victims in the immediate aftermath ofaccidents. While it is undoubtedly true that many peoplefind the image of lawyers sifting through accident and policereports in pursuit of prospective clients unpalatable and invasive, this case targets a different kind of intrusion. TheBar has argued, and the record reflects, that a principal purpose of the ban is "protecting the personal privacy and tranquility of [Florida's] citizens from crass commercial intrusionby attorneys upon their personal grief in times of trauma."Brief for Petitioner 8; cf. Summary of Record, App. I(1) (citizen commentary describing outrage at lawyers' timing insending solicitation letters). The intrusion targeted by theBar's regulation stems not from the fact that a lawyer haslearned about an accident or disaster (as the Court of Appeals notes, in many instances a lawyer need only read thenewspaper to glean this information), but from the lawyer'sconfrontation of victims or relatives with such information,while wounds are still open, in order to solicit their business.In this respect, an untargeted letter mailed to society atlarge is different in kind from a targeted solicitation; theuntargeted letter involves no willful or knowing affront to orinvasion of the tranquility of bereaved or injured individualsand simply does not cause the same kind of reputationalharm to the profession unearthed by the Bar's study.Nor do we find Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463U. S. 60 (1983), dispositive of the issue, despite any superficialresemblance. In Bolger, we rejected the Federal Government's paternalistic effort to ban potentially "offensive" and"intrusive" direct-mail advertisements for contraceptives.Minimizing the Government's allegations of harm, we reasoned that "[r]ecipients of objectionable mailings . . . may` "effectively avoid further bombardment of their sensibilitiessimply by averting their eyes." ' " Id., at 72, quoting Con515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT631Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)Opinion of the Courtsolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n ofN. Y., 447 U. S. 530, 542 (1980), in turn quoting Cohen v. California, 403 U. S. 15, 21 (1971). We found that the " `short,though regular, journey from mail box to trash can . . . isan acceptable burden, at least so far as the Constitution isconcerned.' " 463 U. S., at 72 (ellipses in original), quotingLamont v. Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, 269 F. Supp.880, 883 (SDNY), summarily aff 'd, 386 F. 2d 449 (CA2 1967).Concluding that citizens have at their disposal ample meansof averting any substantial injury inhering in the delivery ofobjectionable contraceptive material, we deemed the State'sintercession unnecessary and unduly restrictive.Here, in contrast, the harm targeted by the Bar cannot beeliminated by a brief journey to the trash can. The purposeof the 30-day targeted direct-mail ban is to forestall the out-rage and irritation with the state-licensed legal professionthat the practice of direct solicitation only days after accidents has engendered. The Bar is concerned not with citizens' "offense" in the abstract, see post, at 638-639, but withthe demonstrable detrimental effects that such "offense" hason the profession it regulates. See Brief for Petitioner 7,14, 24, 28.2 Moreover, the harm posited by the Bar is asmuch a function of simple receipt of targeted solicitationswithin days of accidents as it is a function of the letters'contents. Throwing the letter away shortly after opening itmay minimize the latter intrusion, but it does little to combat the former. We see no basis in Bolger, nor in theother, similar cases cited by the dissent, post, at 638-639,for dismissing the Bar's assertions of harm, particularly2 Missing this nuance altogether, the dissent asserts apocalyptically thatwe are "unsettl[ing] leading First Amendment precedents," post, at 635,639-640. We do no such thing. There is an obvious difference betweensituations in which the government acts in its own interests, or on behalfof entities it regulates, and situations in which the government is motivated primarily by paternalism. The cases cited by the dissent, post, at638-639, focus on the latter situation.515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT632 FLORIDA BAR v. WENT FOR IT, INC.Opinion of the Courtgiven the unrefuted empirical and anecdotal basis for theBar's conclusions.Passing to Central Hudson's third prong, we examine therelationship between the Bar's interests and the means chosen to serve them. See Board of Trustees of State Univ. ofN. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S., at 480. With respect to this prong,the differences between commercial speech and noncommercial speech are manifest. In Fox, we made clear that the"least restrictive means" test has no role in the commercialspeech context. Ibid. "What our decisions require," in-stead, "is a `fit' between the legislature's ends and the meanschosen to accomplish those ends,' a fit that is not necessarilyperfect, but reasonable; that represents not necessarily thesingle best disposition but one whose scope is `in proportionto the interest served,' that employs not necessarily the leastrestrictive means but . . . a means narrowly tailored toachieve the desired objective." Ibid. (citations omitted).Of course, we do not equate this test with the less rigorousobstacles of rational basis review; in Cincinnati v. DiscoveryNetwork, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 417, n. 13 (1993), for example,we observed that the existence of "numerous and obviousless-burdensome alternatives to the restriction on commercial speech . . . is certainly a relevant consideration indetermining whether the `fit' between ends and means isreasonable."Respondents levy a great deal of criticism, echoed in thedissent, post, at 642-644, at the scope of the Bar's restrictionon targeted mail. "[B]y prohibiting written communicationsto all people, whatever their state of mind," respondentscharge, the Rule "keeps useful information from those accident victims who are ready, willing and able to utilize a lawyer's advice." Brief for Respondents 14. This criticismmay be parsed into two components. First, the Rule doesnot distinguish between victims in terms of the severity oftheir injuries. According to respondents, the Rule is unconstitutionally overinclusive insofar as it bans targeted mail515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT633Cite as: 515 U. S. 618 (1995)Opinion of the Courtings even to citizens whose injuries or grief are relativelyminor.Id., at 15. Second, the Rule may prevent citizensfrom learning about their legal options, particularly at a timewhen other actors--opposing counsel and insurance adjusters--may be clamoring for victims' attentions. Any benefitarising from the Bar's regulation, respondents implicitly con-tend, is outweighed by these costs.We are not persuaded by respondents' allegations of con-stitutional infirmity. We find little deficiency in the ban'sfailure to distinguish among injured Floridians by the sever-ity of their pain or the intensity of their grief. Indeed, it ishard to imagine the contours of a regulation that might satisfy respondents on this score. Rather than drawing difficult lines on the basis that some injuries are "severe" andsome situations appropriate (and others, presumably, inappropriate) for grief, anger, or emotion, the Bar has crafted aban applicable to all postaccident or disaster solicitations fora brief 30-day period. Unlike respondents, we do not see"numerous and obvious less-burdensome alternatives" toFlorida's short temporal ban. Cincinnati, supra, at 417,n. 13. The Bar's rule is reasonably well tailored to its statedobjective of eliminating targeted mailings whose typeand timing are a source of distress to Floridians, distressthat has caused many of them to lose respect for the legalprofession.Respondents' second point would have force if the Bar'sRule were not limited to a brief period and if there were notmany other ways for injured Floridians to learn about theavailability of legal representation during that time. Ourlawyer advertising cases have afforded lawyers a great dealof leeway to devise innovative ways to attract new business.Florida permits lawyers to advertise on prime-time television and radio as well as in newspapers and other media.They may rent space on billboards. They may send untargeted letters to the general population, or to discrete segments thereof. There are, of course, pages upon pages de515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT634 FLORIDA BAR v.

These ample alternative channels for receiptof information about the availability of legal representationduring the 30-day period following accidents may explainwhy, despite the ample evidence, testimony, and commentary submitted by those favoring (as well as opposing)unrestricted direct-mail solicitation, respondents have notpointed to--and we have not independently found--a singleexample of an individual case in which immediate solicitationhelped to avoid, or failure to solicit within 30 days broughtabout, the harms that concern the dissent, see post, at 643.In fact, the record contains considerable empirical surveyinformation suggesting that Floridians have little difficultyfinding a lawyer when they need one. See, e. g., Summaryof Record, App. C(4), p. 7; id., App. C(5), p. 8. Finding nobasis to question the commonsense conclusion that the manyalternative channels for communicating necessary information about attorneys are sufficient, we see no defect in Flori-da's regulation.IIISpeech by professionals obviously has many dimensions.There are circumstances in which we will accord speech byattorneys on public issues and matters of legal representa-tion the strongest protection our Constitution has to offer.See, e. g., Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada, 501 U. S. 1030(1991); In re Primus, 436 U. S. 412 (1978). This case, how515us2$86j 08-17-98 13:33:22 PAGES OPINPGT635Cite as: 515 U.

Particularly because the standards andconduct of state-licensed lawyers have traditionally beensubject to extensive regulation by the States, it is all themore appropriate that we limit our scrutiny of state regulations to a level commensurate with the " `subordinate posi-tion' " of commercial speech in the scale of First Amendmentvalues. Fox, 492 U. S., at 477, quoting Ohralik, 436 U. S.,at 456.We believe that the Bar's 30-day restriction on targeteddirect-mail solicitation of accident victims and their relativeswithstands scrutiny under the three-pronged Central Hud-son test that we have devised for this context. The Barhas substantial interest both in protecting injured Floridiansfrom invasive conduct by lawyers and in preventing the erosion of confidence in the profession that such repeated inva-sions have engendered. The Bar's proffered study, unrebutted by respondents below, provides evidence indicating thatthe harms it targets are far from illusory. The palliativedevised by the Bar to address these harms is narrow both inscope and in duration. The Constitution, in our view, requires nothing more.The judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is
