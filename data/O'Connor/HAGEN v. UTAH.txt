In this case we decide whether the Uintah Indian Reservation was diminished by Congress when it was opened tonon-Indian settlers at the turn of the century. If the reservation has been diminished, then the town of Myton, Utah,which lies on opened lands within the historical boundariesof the reservation, is not in "Indian country," see 18 U. S.

UTAHOpinion of the Court$ 1151, and the Utah state courts properly exercised criminaljurisdiction over petitioner, an Indian who committed acrime in Myton. IOn October 3, 1861, President Lincoln reserved about 2million acres of land in the Territory of Utah for Indian settlement. Executive Order No. 38-1, reprinted in 1 C. Kap-pler, Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties 900 (1904). Congress confirmed the President's action in 1864, creating theUintah Valley Reservation. Act of May 5, 1864, ch. 77, 13Stat. 63. According to the 1864 Act, the lands were "setapart for the permanent settlement and exclusive occupationof such of the different tribes of Indians of said territory asmay be induced to inhabit the same."Ibid. The present-day Ute Indian Tribe includes the descendants of the Indianswho settled on the Uintah Reservation.In the latter part of the 19th century, federal Indian policychanged. See F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law127-139 (1982 ed.). Indians were no longer to inhabit communally owned reservations, but instead were to be givenindividual parcels of land; any remaining lands were to beopened for settlement by non-Indians. The General Allot-ment Act, Act of Feb. 8, 1887, ch. 119, 24 Stat. 388, grantedthe President authority "to allot portions of reservation landto tribal members and, with tribal consent, to sell the surpluslands to [non-Indian] settlers, with the proceeds of thesesales being dedicated to the Indians' benefit." DeCoteau v.District County Court for Tenth Judicial District, 420 U. S.425, 432 (1975).Pursuant to the General Allotment Act, Congress in 1894directed the President to appoint a commission to negotiatewith the Indians for the allotment of Uintah Reservationlands and the "relinquishment to the United States" of allunallotted lands. Act of Aug. 15, 1894, ch. 290, $ 22, 28 Stat.337. That effort did not succeed, and in 1898 Congress directed the President to appoint another commission to nego510us2$u22 06-19-97 22:49:28 PAGES OPINPGT403Cite as: 510 U.

The Indi-ans resisted those efforts as well. Various bills that wouldhave opened the reservation unilaterally (i. e., without theconsent of the Indians) were subsequently introduced in theSenate but were not enacted into law. See Leasing of In-dian Lands, Hearings before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, S. Doc. No. 212, 57th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1902).In 1902, Congress passed an Act which provided that if amajority of the adult male members of the Uintah and WhiteRiver Indians consented, the Secretary of the Interiorshould make allotments by October 1, 1903, out of the UintahReservation. Act of May 27, 1902, ch. 888, 32 Stat. 263.1The allotments under the 1902 Act were to be 80 acres foreach head of a family and 40 acres for each other member of1 The 1902 Act provided in relevant part:"That the Secretary of the Interior, with the consent thereto of themajority of the adult male Indians of the Uintah and the White Rivertribes of Ute Indians, to be ascertained as soon as practicable by an inspector, shall cause to be allotted to each head of a family eighty acres ofagricultural land which can be irrigated and forty acres of such land toeach other member of said tribes, said allotments to be made prior toOctober first, nineteen hundred and three, on which date all the unallottedlands within said reservation shall be restored to the public domain: Provided, That persons entering any of said land under the homestead lawshall pay therefor at the rate of one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre:And provided further, That . . . the proceeds of the sale of the lands sorestored to the public domain shall be applied, first, to the reimbursementof the United States for any moneys advanced to said Indians to carry intoeffect the foregoing provisions; and the remainder, under the direction ofthe Secretary of the Interior, shall be used for the benefit of said Indians.And the sum of seventy thousand and sixty-four dollars and forty-eightcents is hereby appropriated, out of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to be paid to the Uintah and the White River tribes ofUte Indians, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, whenevera majority of the adult male Indians of said tribes shall have consented tothe allotment of lands and the restoration of the unallotted lands withinsaid reservation as herein provided." 32 Stat. 263-264.510us2$u22 06-19-97 22:49:28 PAGES OPINPGT404 HAGEN v.

The Act also provided that when the deadlinefor allotments passed, "all the unallotted lands within saidreservation shall be restored to the public domain" and sub-ject to homesteading at $1.25 per acre. Ibid. The proceedsfrom the sale of lands restored to the public domain were tobe used for the benefit of the Indians.A month after the passage of the 1902 Act, Congress di-rected the Secretary of the Interior to set apart sufficientland to serve the grazing needs of the Indians remaining onthe reservation. J. Res. 31, 57th Cong., 1st Sess. (1902), 32Stat. 744.2 The resolution clarified that $70,000 appro-priated by the 1902 Act was to be paid to the Indians "without awaiting their action upon the proposed allotment in sev-eralty of lands in that reservation and the restoration of thesurplus lands to the public domain." Id., at 745.In January 1903, this Court held that Congress can unilaterally alter reservation boundaries. Lone Wolf v. Hitch-cock, 187 U. S. 553, 567-568. On Mar. 3, 1903, Congress directed the Secretary to allot the Uintah lands unilaterally ifthe Indians did not give their consent by June 1 of that year,and deferred the opening of the unallotted lands "as providedby the [1902 Act]" until October 1, 1904. Act of Mar. 3, 1903,2 The 1902 Joint Resolution provided in relevant part:"In addition to the allotments in severalty to the Uintah and WhiteRiver Utes of the Uintah Indian Reservation in the State of Utah, theSecretary of the Interior shall, before any of said lands are opened todisposition under any public land law, select and set apart for the use incommon of the Indians of that reservation such an amount of non-irrigablegrazing lands therein at one or more places as will subserve the reasonablerequirements of said Indians for the grazing of live stock.. . . . ."The item of seventy thousand and sixty-four dollars and forty-eight centsappropriated by the Act which is hereby supplemented and modified, tobe paid to the Uintah and White River tribes of Ute Indians in satisfactionof certain claims named in said Act, shall be paid to the Indians entitledthereto without awaiting their action upon the proposed allotment in severalty of lands in that reservation and the restoration of the surplus landsto the public domain." 32 Stat. 744-745.510us2$u22 06-19-97 22:49:28 PAGES OPINPGT405Cite as: 510 U.

Act of Apr. 21, 1904,ch. 1402, 33 Stat. 207.43 The 1903 Act provided in relevant part:"[Money is hereby appropriated to] enable the Secretary of the Interiorto do the necessary surveying and otherwise carry out the purposes of somuch of the Act of May twenty-seventh, nineteen hundred and two, . . . asprovides for the allotment of the . . .

The "proceedsof the sale of such lands" were to be "applied as provided inthe [1902 Act] and the Acts amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto." Id., at 1070.The Government once again failed to obtain the consent ofthe Indians. On July 14, 1905, President Roosevelt issuedthe following Proclamation:"Whereas it was provided by the [1902 Act], amongother things, that on October first, 1903, the unallottedlands in the Uintah Indian Reservation, in the State ofUtah, `shall be restored to the public domain: Provided,That persons entering any of said lands under the home-stead laws shall pay therefor at the rate of [$1.25] peracre.'"And, whereas, the time for the opening of said unallotted lands was extended to October 1, 1904, by the[1903 Act], and was extended to March 10, 1905, by the[1904 Act], and was again extended to not later than September 1, 1905, by the [1905 Act], which last named actprovided, among other things: [`That the said unallottedlands . . . shall be disposed of under the general provisions of the homestead and townsite laws of the UnitedStates . . . .']"Now, therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt, President ofthe United States of America, by virtue of the power inme vested by said Acts of Congress, do hereby declareand make known that all the unallotted lands in said510us2$u22 06-19-97 22:49:28 PAGES OPINPGT408 HAGEN v. UTAHOpinion of the Courtreservation . . . will on and after the 28th day of August,1905, in the manner hereinafter prescribed, and nototherwise, be opened to entry, settlement and disposi-tion under the general provisions of the homesteadand townsite laws of the United States." 34 Stat.3119-3120.The Proclamation went on to detail a lottery scheme for theallocation of the lands to settlers.IIIn 1989, petitioner was charged in Utah state court withdistribution of a controlled substance. The offense occurredin the town of Myton, which was established within the origi-nal boundaries of the Uintah Indian Reservation when thereservation was opened to non-Indian settlement in 1905.Petitioner initially pleaded guilty, but subsequently filed amotion to withdraw his guilty plea. The basis of the motionwas that the Utah state courts lacked jurisdiction over petitioner because he was an Indian and the crime had been com-mitted in Indian country. The trial court denied the motion,finding that petitioner is not an Indian.The state appellate court reversed. It concluded thatpetitioner is an Indian, a determination that is not at issuein this Court. The court also held that Myton is in Indiancountry, relying on Ute Indian Tribe v. Utah, 773 F. 2d 1087(1985) (en banc), cert. denied, 479 U. S. 994 (1986), in whichthe Tenth Circuit held that the Uintah Indian Reserva-tion was not diminished when it was opened to settlementin 1905. Because Congress has not granted criminal ju-risdiction to the State of Utah to try crimes committed byIndians in Indian country, cf. Negonsott v. Samuels, 507 U. S.99, 103 (1993);Washington v. Confederated Bands andTribes of Yakima Nation, 439 U. S. 463, 471-474 (1979), theappellate court held that the state courts lacked jurisdictionover petitioner. The court accordingly vacated petitioner'sconviction.510us2$u22 06-19-97 22:49:28 PAGES OPINPGT409Cite as: 510 U. S. 399 (1994)Opinion of the CourtThe Utah Supreme Court reversed on the authority ofState v. Perank, 858 P. 2d 927 (1992), in which the court hadheld (on the same day as the decision in petitioner's case)that the reservation had been diminished and that Mytonwas outside its boundaries, and thus that petitioner's offensewas subject to state criminal jurisdiction. 858 P. 2d 925(1992); see Solem v. Bartlett, 465 U. S. 463, 467 (1984) ("As adoctrinal matter, the States have jurisdiction over unallottedopened lands if the applicable surplus land Act freed thatland of its reservation status and thereby diminished the reservation boundaries"). The court accordingly reinstatedpetitioner's conviction.We granted certiorari, 507 U. S. 1028 (1993), to resolve thedirect conflict between these decisions of the Tenth Circuitand the Utah Supreme Court on the question whether theUintah Reservation has been diminished.IIIWe first address a threshold question: whether the Stateof Utah, which was a party to the Tenth Circuit proceedings,should be collaterally estopped from relitigating the reserva-tion boundaries. In Perank, the Utah Supreme Court notedthat "neither Perank, the Department of Justice, nor theTribe suggests that the Tenth Circuit'sen banc decision inUte Indian Tribe has res judicata effect in this case." 858P. 2d, at 931. Because "[r]es judicata is an affirmative de-fense in both criminal and civil cases and therefore is waivable," id., at 931, n. 3, the court went on to consider the meritsof the State's claim.Petitioner's only recourse would have been to attack thejudgment inPerank on the ground that the Utah SupremeCourt failed to give effect sua sponte to the prior determination in Ute Indian Tribe that the reservation had not beendiminished. Although that issue is one of federal law, seeRestatement (Second) of Judgments $ 86 (1982), it was notpresented in the petition for a writ of certiorari. It there510us2$u22 06-19-97 22:49:28 PAGES OPINPGT410 HAGEN v. UTAHOpinion of the Courtfore is not properly before us. Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S.519, 535-536 (1992); see Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo KabushikiKaisha v. U. S. Philips Corp., 510 U. S. 27 (1993) (per cu-riam). Moreover, petitioner disavowed the collateral estoppel argument at the petition stage, in response to a brieffiled by the Ute Indian Tribe:"The question presented in the petition was whether thereservation had been diminished by acts of congress.[This Court's Rule 14.1(a)] does not appear to allow dif-ferent issues to be raised. The Ute Indian Tribe arguesthat the Supreme Court of the State of Utah shouldhave reached a different decision in[Perank] based onthe doctrine of collateral estoppel . . . . Regardless ofthe opinion held by the Ute Indian Tribe of the Perankdecision,the decision has been made and is controllingin petitioner's case." Supplemental Brief for Petitioner 2 (filed Dec. 2, 1992) (emphasis added).Because we see no reason to consider an argument that peti-tioner not only failed to raise, but also expressly refused torely upon in seeking a writ of certiorari, we turn to themerits.IVIn Solem v. Bartlett, we recognized:"It is settled law that some surplus land Acts diminishedreservations, see,e. g., Rosebud Sioux Tribe v. Kneip,430 U. S. 584 (1977); DeCoteau v. District County Court,420 U. S. 425 (1975), and other surplus land Acts did not,see, e. g., Mattz v. Arnett, 412 U. S. 481 (1973); Seymourv. Superintendent, 368 U. S. 351 (1962). The effect ofany given surplus land Act depends on the language ofthe Act and the circumstances underlying its passage."465 U. S., at 469.In determining whether a reservation has been diminished,"[o]ur precedents in the area have established a fairly clean510us2$u22 06-19-97 22:49:28 PAGES OPINPGT411Cite as: 510 U. S. 399 (1994)Opinion of the Courtanalytical structure," id., at 470, directing us to look to threefactors. The most probative evidence of diminishment is, ofcourse, the statutory language used to open the Indian lands.Ibid. We have also considered the historical context surrounding the passage of the surplus land Acts, although wehave been careful to distinguish between evidence of the con-temporaneous understanding of the particular Act and matters occurring subsequent to the Act's passage. Id., at 471.Finally, "[o]n a more pragmatic level, we have recognizedthat who actually moved onto opened reservation lands isalso relevant to deciding whether a surplus land Act diminished a reservation." Ibid. Throughout the inquiry, we resolve any ambiguities in favor of the Indians, and we will notlightly find diminishment. Id., at 470, 472; see also SouthDakota v. Bourland, 508 U. S. 679, 687 (1993) (" `[S]tatutesare to be construed liberally in favor of the Indians, withambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit' " (quotingCounty of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands ofYakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 269 (1992) (internal quotationmarks omitted))).The Solicitor General, appearing as amicus in support ofpetitioner, argues that our cases establish a "clear-statementrule," pursuant to which a finding of diminishment wouldrequire both explicit language of cession or other languageevidencing the surrender of tribal interests and an unconditional commitment from Congress to compensate the Indians. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 7-8.We disagree. First, although the statutory language must"establis[h] an express congressional purpose to diminish,"Solem, 465 U. S., at 475, we have never required any particular form of words before finding diminishment, see RosebudSioux Tribe v. Kneip, 430 U. S. 584, 588, and n. 4 (1977). Second, we noted in Solem that a statutory expression of congressional intent to diminish, coupled with the provision ofa sum certain payment, would establish a nearly conclusivepresumption that the reservation had been diminished. 465510us2$u22 06-19-97 22:49:28 PAGES OPINPGT412 HAGEN v. UTAHOpinion of the CourtU. S., at 470-471. While the provision for definite paymentcan certainly provide additional evidence of diminishment,the lack of such a provision does not lead to the contraryconclusion. In fact, the statutes at issue in Rosebud, whichwe held to have effected a diminishment, did not provide forthe payment of a sum certain to the Indians. See 430 U. S.,at 596, and n. 18. We thus decline to abandon our traditionalapproach to diminishment cases, which requires us to examine all the circumstances surrounding the opening of areservation.AThe operative language of the 1902 Act provided for alloca-tions of reservation land to Indians, and that "all the unallotted lands within said reservation shall be restored to the pub-lic domain." 32 Stat. 263 (emphasis added). The publicdomain was the land owned by the Government, mostly inthe West, that was "available for sale, entry, and settlementunder the homestead laws, or other disposition under thegeneral body of land laws." E. Peffer, The Closing of thePublic Domain 6 (1951). "[F]rom an early period in the his-tory of the government it [was] the practice of the Presidentto order, from time to time, . . . parcels of land belonging tothe United States to be reserved from sale and set apart forpublic uses." Grisar v. McDowell, 6 Wall. 363, 381 (1868).This power of reservation was exercised for various purposes, including Indian settlement, bird preservation, andmilitary installations, "when it appeared that the public interest would be served by withdrawing or reserving partsof the public domain." United States v. Midwest Oil Co.,236 U. S. 459, 471 (1915).It follows that when lands so reserved were "restored" tothe public domain--i. e., once again opened to sale or settle-ment--their previous public use was extinguished. SeeSioux Tribe v. United States, 316 U. S. 317, 323 (1942) (Presi-dent ordered lands previously reserved for Indian use " `restored to the public domain[,] . . . the same being no longer510us2$u22 06-19-97 22:49:28 PAGES OPINPGT413Cite as: 510 U. S. 399 (1994)Opinion of the Courtneeded for the purpose for which they were withdrawn fromsale and settlement' ");United States v. Pelican, 232 U. S.442, 445-446 (1914). Statutes of the period indicate thatCongress considered Indian reservations as separate fromthe public domain. See, e. g., Act of June 25, 1910, $ 6, 36Stat. 857 (criminalizing forest fires started "upon the publicdomain, or upon any Indian reservation") (quoted inUnitedStates v. Alford, 274 U. S. 264, 266-267 (1927)). Likewise,inDeCoteau we emphasized the distinction between reservation and public domain lands: "That the lands ceded in theother agreements werereturned to the public domain,stripped of reservation status, can hardly be questioned . . . .The sponsors of the legislation stated repeatedly that theratified agreements would return the ceded lands to the `public domain.' " 420 U. S., at 446 (emphasis added).In Solem, the Court held that an Act which authorized theSecretary of the Interior to " `sell and dispose of ' " unallottedreservation lands merely opened the reservation to nonIndian settlement and did not diminish it. 465 U. S., at 472-474. Elsewhere in the same statute, Congress had grantedthe Indians permission to harvest timber on the opened lands" `as long as the lands remain part of the public domain.' "Id., at 475. We recognized that this reference to the publicdomain "support[ed]" the view that a reservation had beendiminished, but that it was "hardly dispositive." Id., at 475.We noted that "even without diminishment, unallottedopened lands could be conceived of as being in the `publicdomain' inasmuch as they were available for settlement."Id., at 475, n. 17. The Act in Solem, however, did not "restore" the lands to the public domain. More importantly,the reference to the public domain did not appear in the operative language of the statute opening the reservation landsfor settlement, which is the relevant point of reference forthe diminishment inquiry. Our cases considering operativelanguage of restoration have uniformly equated it with a congressional purpose to terminate reservation status.510us2$u22 06-19-97 22:49:28 PAGES OPINPGT414 HAGEN v. UTAHOpinion of the CourtIn Seymour v. Superintendent of Wash. State Penitentiary, 368 U. S. 351 (1962), for example, the question waswhether the Colville Reservation, in the State of Washington, had been diminished. The Court noted that an 1892 Actwhich " `vacated and restored to the public domain' " aboutone-half of the reservation lands had diminished the reservation as to that half. Id., at 354. As to the other half, Congress in 1906 had provided for allotments to the Indians, followed by the sale of mineral lands and entry onto the surpluslands under the homestead laws. This Court held that the1906 Act did not result in diminishment: "Nowhere in the1906 Act is there to be found any language similar to that inthe 1892 Act expressly vacating the South Half of the reservation and restoring that land to the public domain." Id.,at 355. This Court subsequently characterized the 1892 Actat issue in Seymour as an example of Congress' using "clearlanguage of express termination when that result is desired."Mattz, 412 U. S., at 504, n. 22. And in Rosebud, all nineJustices agreed that a statute which " `restored to the publicdomain' " portions of a reservation would result in diminishment. 430 U. S., at 589, and n. 5; id., at 618 (Marshall, J.,dissenting).In light of our precedents, we hold that the restoration ofunallotted reservation lands to the public domain evidencesa congressional intent with respect to those lands inconsistent with the continuation of reservation status. Thus, theexistence of such language in the operative section of a surplus land Act indicates that the Act diminished the reservation. Indeed, we have found only one case in which a Federal Court of Appeals decided that statutory restorationlanguage did not terminate a reservation, Ute Indian Tribe,773 F. 2d, at 1092, a conclusion the Tenth Circuit has sincedisavowed as "unexamined and unsupported." Pittsburg &Midway Coal Mining Co. v. Yazzie, 909 F. 2d 1387, 1400,cert. denied, 498 U. S. 1012 (1990).510us2$u22 06-19-97 22:49:28 PAGES OPINPGT415Cite as: 510 U. S. 399 (1994)Opinion of the CourtUntil the Ute Indian Tribe litigation in the Tenth Circuit,every court had decided that the unallotted lands were restored to the public domain pursuant to the terms of the 1902Act, with the 1905 Act simply extending the time for openingand providing for a few details. Hanson v. United States,153 F. 2d 162, 162-163 (CA10 1946); United States v. Boss,160 F. 132, 133 (Utah 1906);Uintah and White River Bandsof Ute Indians v. United States, 139 Ct. Cl. 1, 21-23 (1957);Sowards v. Meagher, 108 P. 1112, 1114 (Utah 1910). Petitioner argues, however, that the 1905 Act changed the "man-ner" in which the lands were to be opened. That Act specified that the homestead and townsite laws would apply, andso superseded the "restore to the public domain" languageof the 1902 Act, language that was not repeated in the 1905Act. We disagree, because the baseline intent to diminishthe reservation expressed in the 1902 Act survived the passage of the 1905 Act.Every congressional action subsequent to the 1902 Act referred to that statute. The 1902 Joint Resolution providedan appropriation prior to the restoration of surplus reservation lands to the public domain. 32 Stat. 744. The 1903 and1904 Acts simply extended the deadline for opening the reservations in order to allow more time for surveying thelands, so that the "purposes" of the 1902 Act could be carriedout. 32 Stat. 997; 33 Stat. 207. And the 1905 Act recognized that they were all tied together when it provided thatthe proceeds of the sale of the unallotted lands "shall be applied as provided in the [1902 Act] and the Acts amendatorythereof and supplementary thereto." 33 Stat. 1070. TheCongress that passed the 1905 Act clearly viewed the 1902statute as the basic legislation upon which subsequent Actswere built.Furthermore, the structure of the statutes requires thatthe 1905 Act and the 1902 Act be read together. Whereasthe 1905 Act provided for the disposition of unallotted lands,it was the 1902 Act that provided for allotments to the Indi510us2$u22 06-19-97 22:49:28 PAGES OPINPGT416 HAGEN v. UTAHOpinion of the Courtans. The 1902 Act also established the price for which theunallotted lands were to be sold, and what was to be donewith the proceeds of the sales. The 1905 Act did not repeatthese essential features of the opening, because they werealready spelled out in the 1902 Act. The two statutes--aswell as those that came in between--must therefore beread together.Finally, the general rule that repeals by implication aredisfavored is especially strong in this case, because the 1905Actexpressly repealed the provision in the 1903 Act concern-ing the siting of the grazing lands; if Congress had meant torepeal any part of any other previous statute, it could easilyhave done so. Furthermore, the predicate for finding an implied repeal is not present in this case, because the openingprovisions of the two statutes are not inconsistent: The 1902Act also provided that the unallotted lands restored to thepublic domain could be sold pursuant to the homestead laws.Other surplus land Acts which we have held to have effecteddiminishment similarly provided for initial entry under thehomestead and townsite laws. See Rosebud, supra, at 608;DeCoteau, 420 U. S., at 442.BContemporary historical evidence supports our conclusionthat Congress intended to diminish the Uintah Reservation.As we have noted, the plain language of the 1902 Act demon-strated the congressional purpose to diminish the UintahReservation. Under the 1902 Act, however, the consent ofthe Indians was required before the reservation could be diminished; that consent was withheld by the Indians living onthe reservation. After this Court'sLone Wolf decision in1903, Congress authorized the Secretary of the Interior toproceed unilaterally. The Acting Commissioner for IndianAffairs in the Department of the Interior directed IndianInspector James McLaughlin to travel to the Uintah Reser-vation to "endeavor to obtain [the Indians'] consent to the510us2$u22 06-19-97 22:49:28 PAGES OPINPGT417Cite as: 510 U. S. 399 (1994)Opinion of the Courtallotment of lands as provided in the law, and to the restora-tion of the surplus lands." Letter from A. C. Tonner toJames McLaughlin (Apr. 27, 1903), reprinted in S. Doc. No.159, 58th Cong., 3d Sess., 9 (1905). The Acting Commissioner noted, however, that the effect of the 1903 Act wasthat "if the [Indians] do not consent to the allotments by thefirst of June next the allotments are to be made notwithstanding, and the unallotted lands . . . are to be opened toentry" according to the terms of the 1902 Act.Id., at 8-9.Inspector McLaughlin explained the effect of these recentdevelopments to the Indians living on the Reservation:" `By that decision of the Supreme Court, Congress hasthe legal right to legislate in regard to Indian lands, andCongress has enacted a law which requires you to takeyour allotments.. . . . ." `You say that [the Reservation boundary] line is veryheavy and that the reservation is nailed down upon theborder. That is very true as applying to the past manyyears and up to now, but congress has provided legislation which will pull up the nails which hold down thatline andafter next year there will be no outside boundary line to this reservation.' " Minutes of CouncilsHeld by James McLaughlin, U. S. Indian Inspector, withthe Uintah and White River Ute Indians at UintahAgency, Utah, from May 18 to May 23, 1903, excerptedin App. to Brief for Respondent 4a-5a (emphasis added).Inspector McLaughlin's picturesque phrase reflects the contemporaneous understanding, by him conveyed to the Indians, that the reservation would be diminished by operationof the 1902 and 1903 Acts notwithstanding the failure of theIndians to give their consent.The Secretary of the Interior informed Congress in February 1904 that the necessary surveying could not be completed before the date set for the opening, and requested510us2$u22 06-19-97 22:49:28 PAGES OPINPGT418 HAGEN v. UTAHOpinion of the Courtthat the opening be delayed. Letter from E. A. Hitchcockto the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs(Feb. 6, 1904), reprinted in S. Doc. No. 159, supra, at 17. Inthe 1904 Act, Congress accordingly extended the time foropening until March 10, 1905, and appropriated additionalfunds "to enable the Secretary of the Interior to do the necessary surveying" of the reservation lands. 33 Stat. 207.The Secretary of the Interior subsequently informed Congress that a further extension would be necessary becausethe surveying and allotments could not be completed duringthe winter. Letter from E. A. Hitchcock to the Chairmanof the House Committee on Indian Affairs (Dec. 10, 1904),reprinted in S. Doc. No. 159, supra, at 21.The House of Representatives took up the matter on January 21, 1905. The bill on which debate was held providedthat "so much of said lands as will be under the provisionsof said acts restored to the public domain shall be open tosettlement and entry by proclamation of the President of theUnited States, which proclamation shall prescribe the man-ner in which these lands may be settled upon, occupied, andentered." H. R. 17474, quoted in 39 Cong. Rec. 1180 (1905).Representative Howell of Utah offered as an amendment"[t]hat for one year immediately following the restoration ofsaid lands to the public domain said lands shall be subject toentry only under the homestead, town-site, and mining lawsof the United States."Ibid. Significantly, RepresentativeHowell offered his amendment as an addition to, not a replacement for, the language in the bill that explicitly referredto the lands' restoration to the public domain. He explained:"In the pending bill these lands, when restored to thepublic domain, are subject to entry under the generalland laws of the United States, coupled with such rulesand regulations as the President may prescribe. In myhumble judgment there should be some provision suchas is embodied in my amendment, limiting the lands inthe reservation to entry under the homestead, town-site,510us2$u22 06-19-97 22:49:29 PAGES OPINPGT419Cite as: 510 U. S. 399 (1994)Opinion of the Courtand mining laws alone for one year from the date ofthe opening. . . ."Congress should see to it that until such time as thoselands easy of access, reclamation, and irrigation are settled by actual home makers the provisions of the homestead law alone shall prevail. This policy is in accordwith the dominant sentiment of the time, viz, that thepublic lands shall be reserved for actual homes for thepeople." Id., at 1182.Although the amendment was rejected in the House ofRepresentatives, id., at 1186, the Senate substituted the current version of the 1905 Act, which is similar to the amendment offered by Representative Howell but omits the restoration language of the House version. Id., at 3522. In thehearings on the Senate bill, Senator Teller of Colorado hadstated that "I am not going to agree to any entry of that landexcept under the homestead and town-site entries," because"I am not going to consent to any speculators getting publicland if I can help it." Indian Appropriation Bill, 1906, Hearings before the Senate Subcommittee of the Committee onIndian Affairs, 58th Cong., 3d Sess., 30 (1905). Thus, although we have no way of knowing for sure why the Senatedecided to limit the "manner" of opening, it seems likely thatCongress wanted to limit land speculation. That objectiveis not inconsistent with the restoration of the unallottedlands to the public domain: Once the lands became public,Congress could of course place limitations on their entry,sale, and settlement.The Proclamation whereby President Roosevelt actuallyopened the reservation to settlement makes clear that the1905 Act did not repeal the restoration language of the 1902Act. In that document, the President stated that the 1902Act provided that the unallotted lands were to be restoredto the public domain, that the 1903, 1904, and 1905 Acts extended the time for the opening, and that those lands were510us2$u22 06-19-97 22:49:29 PAGES OPINPGT420 HAGEN v. UTAHOpinion of the Courtnow opened for settlement under the homestead laws "byvirtue of the power in [him] vested by said Acts of Congress." 34 Stat. 3120 (emphasis added). President Roose-velt thus clearly understood the 1905 Act to incorporate the1902 Act, and specifically the restoration language. This"unambiguous, contemporaneous, statement, by the Nation'sChief Executive," Rosebud, 430 U. S., at 602, is clear evi-dence of the understanding at the time that the Uintah Reservation would be diminished by the opening of the unallot-ted lands to non-Indian settlement.The subsequent history is less illuminating than the con-temporaneous evidence. Since 1905, Congress has repeatedly referred to the Uintah Reservation in both the past andpresent tenses, reinforcing our longstanding observation that"[t]he views of a subsequent Congress form a hazardous basisfor inferring the intent of an earlier one." United States v.Philadelphia Nat. Bank, 374 U. S. 321, 348-349 (1963) (inter-nal quotation marks omitted). The District Court in theUte Indian Tribe case extensively cataloged these congres-sional references, and we agree with that court's conclusion:"Not only are the references grossly inconsistent when con-sidered together, they . . . are merely passing references intext, not deliberate expressions of informal conclusions aboutcongressional intent in 1905." 521 F. Supp. 1072, 1135 (Utah1981). Because the textual and contemporaneous evidenceof diminishment is clear, however, the confusion in the subsequent legislative record does nothing to alter our conclusionthat the Uintah Reservation was diminished.CFinally, our conclusion that the statutory language and his-tory indicate a congressional intent to diminish is not controverted by the subsequent demographics of the Uintah Valleyarea. We have recognized that "[w]hen an area is predominately populated by non-Indians with only a few survivingpockets of Indian allotments, finding that the land remains510us2$u22 06-19-97 22:49:29 PAGES OPINPGT421Cite as: 510 U. S. 399 (1994)Opinion of the CourtIndian country seriously burdens the administration of stateand local governments." Solem, 465 U. S., at 471-472, n. 12.Of the original 2 million acres reserved for Indian occupation, approximately 400,000 were opened for non-Indian settlement in 1905. Almost all of the non-Indians live on theopened lands. The current population of the area is approximately 85 percent non-Indian. 1990 Census of Populationand Housing, Summary Population and Housing Characteristics: Utah, 1990 CPH-1-46, Table 17, p. 73. The populationof the largest city in the area--Roosevelt City, named forthe President who opened the reservation for settlement--is about 93 percent non-Indian. Id., Table 3, p. 13.The seat of Ute tribal government is in Fort Duchesne,which is situated on Indian trust lands. By contrast, wefound it significant in Solem that the seat of tribal government was located on opened lands. 465 U. S., at 480. TheState of Utah exercised jurisdiction over the opened landsfrom the time the reservation was opened until the TenthCircuit's Ute Indian Tribe decision. That assumption ofauthority again stands in sharp contrast to the situation inSolem, where "tribal authorities and Bureau of Indian Affairs personnel took primary responsibility for policing . . .the opened lands during the years following [the opening in]1908." 465 U. S., at 480. This "jurisdictional history," aswell as the current population situation in the Uintah Valley,demonstrates a practical acknowledgment that the Reservation was diminished; a contrary conclusion would seriouslydisrupt the justifiable expectations of the people living in thearea. Cf. Rosebud, supra, at 604-605.VWe conclude that the Uintah Indian Reservation has beendiminished by Congress.
