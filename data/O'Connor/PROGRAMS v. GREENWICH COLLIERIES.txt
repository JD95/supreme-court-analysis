In adjudicating benefits claims under the Black Lung Ben-efits Act (BLBA), 83 Stat. 792, as amended, 30 U. S. C. $ 901et seq.

C. $ 901 et seq., the Department of Laborapplies what it calls the "true doubt" rule. This rule essentially shifts the burden of persuasion to the party opposingthe benefits claim--when the evidence is evenly balanced,the benefits claimant wins. This litigation presents thequestion whether the rule is consistent with $ 7(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which states that "[e]x-cept as otherwise provided by statute, the proponent of arule or order has the burden of proof." 5 U. S. C. $ 556(d).IWe review two separate decisions of the Court of Appealsfor the Third Circuit. In one, Andrew Ondecko applied fordisability benefits under the BLBA after working as a coalminer for 31 years. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)determined that Ondecko had pneumoconiosis (or black lungdisease), that he was totally disabled by the disease, and thatthe disease resulted from coal mine employment. In resolv-ing the first two issues, the ALJ relied on the true doubtrule. In resolving the third, she relied on the rebuttablepresumption that a miner with pneumoconiosis who workedin the mines for at least 10 years developed the disease be#Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the AmericanInsurance Association by William J.

GREENWICH COLLIERIESOpinion of the Courtcause of his employment. 20 CFR $ 718.203(b) (1993). TheDepartment's Benefits Review Board affirmed, concludingthat the ALJ had considered all the evidence, had found eachside's evidence to be equally probative, and had properly resolved the dispute in Ondecko's favor under the true doubtrule. The Court of Appeals vacated the Board's decision,holding that the true doubt rule is inconsistent with theDepartment's own regulations under the BLBA, $ 718.403,as well as with Mullins Coal Co. of Va. v. Director, Officeof Workers' Compensation Programs, 484 U. S. 135 (1987).990 F. 2d 730 (1993).In the other case, Michael Santoro suffered a work-relatedback and neck injury while employed by respondent MaherTerminals. Within a few months Santoro was diagnosedwith nerve cancer, and he died shortly thereafter. Hiswidow filed a claim under the LHWCA alleging that thework injury had rendered her husband disabled and causedhis death. After reviewing the evidence for both sides, theALJ found it equally probative and, relying on the truedoubt rule, awarded benefits to the claimant. The Boardaffirmed, finding no error in the ALJ's analysis or his application of the true doubt rule. The Court of Appeals reversed,holding that the true doubt rule is inconsistent with $ 7(c)of the APA. 992 F. 2d 1277 (1993). In so holding, thecourt expressly disagreed with Freeman United Coal Mining Co. v. Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, 988F. 2d 706 (CA7 1993). We granted certiorari to resolve theconflict. 510 U. S. 1068 (1994).IIAs a threshold matter, we must decide whether $ 7(c)'s bur-den of proof provision applies to adjudications under theLHWCA and the BLBA. Section 7(c) of the APA applies"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute," and the Department argues that the statutes at issue here make clear that$ 7(c) does not apply. We disagree.512us2$78J 01-08-98 12:23:11 PAGES OPINPGT271Cite as: 512 U. S. 267 (1994)Opinion of the CourtThe Department points out that in conducting investiga-tions or hearings pursuant to the LHWCA, the "Board shallnot be bound by common law or statutory rules of evidenceor by technical or formal rules of procedure, except as provided by this chapter." 33 U. S. C. $ 923(a). But the assignment of the burden of proof is a rule of substantive law,American Dredging Co. v. Miller, 510 U. S. 443, 454 (1994),so it is unclear whether this exception even applies. Moreimportantly, $ 923 by its terms applies "except as providedby this chapter," and the chapter provides that $ 7(c) doesindeed apply to the LHWCA. 33 U. S. C. $ 919(d) ("Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, any hearingheld under this chapter shall be conducted in accordancewith [the APA]"); 5 U. S. C. $ 554(c)(2). We do not lightlypresume exemptions to the APA, Brownell v. Tom WeShung, 352 U. S. 180, 185 (1956), and we do not think $ 923by its terms exempts the LHWCA from $ 7(c).The Department's argument under the BLBA fares no better. The BLBA also incorporates the APA (by incorporating parts of the LHWCA), but it does so "except as otherwise provided . . . by regulations of the Secretary." 30U. S. C. $ 932(a). The Department argues that the followingBLBA regulation so provides: "In enacting [the BLBA], Congress intended that claimants be given the benefit of all reasonable doubt as to the existence of total or partial disabilityor death due to pneumoconiosis." 20 CFR $ 718.3(c) (1993).But we do not think this regulation can fairly be read asauthorizing the true doubt rule and rejecting the APA's burden of proof provision. Not only does the regulation failto mention the true doubt rule or $ 7(c), it does not evenmention the concept of burden shifting or burdens of proof.Accordingly--and assuming, arguendo, that the Departmenthas the authority to displace $ 7(c) through regulation--thisambiguous regulation does not overcome the presumptionthat these adjudications under the BLBA are subject to$ 7(c)'s burden of proof provision.512us2$78J 01-08-98 12:23:11 PAGES OPINPGT272 DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF WORKERS' COMPENSATIONPROGRAMS v. GREENWICH COLLIERIESOpinion of the CourtIIIWe turn now to the meaning of "burden of proof " as usedin $ 7(c). Respondents contend that the Court of Appealswas correct in reading "burden of proof " to include the bur-den ofpersuasion. The Department disagrees, contendingthat "burden of proof " imposes only the burden of production (i. e., the burden of going forward with evidence). Thecases turn on this dispute, for if respondents are correct, thetrue doubt rule must fall: because the true doubt rule placesthe burden of persuasion on the party opposing the benefitsaward, it would violate $ 7(c)'s requirement that the burdenof persuasion rest with the party seeking the award.ABecause the term "burden of proof " is nowhere defined inthe APA, our task is to construe it in accord with its ordinaryor natural meaning. Smith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223,228 (1993). It is easier to state this task than to accomplishit, for the meaning of words may change over time, and manywords have several meanings even at a fixed point in time.Victor v. Nebraska, 511 U. S. 1, 13-14 (1994); see generallyCunningham, Levi, Green, & Kaplan, Plain Meaning andHard Cases, 103 Yale L. J. 1561 (1994). Here we must seekto ascertain the ordinary meaning of "burden of proof " in1946, the year the APA was enacted.For many years the term "burden of proof " was ambiguous because the term was used to describe two distinct con-cepts. Burden of proof was frequently used to refer to whatwe now call the burden of persuasion--the notion that if theevidence is evenly balanced, the party that bears the burdenof persuasion must lose. But it was also used to refer towhat we now call the burden of production--a party's obligation to come forward with evidence to support its claim.See J. Thayer, Evidence at the Common Law 355-384 (1898)(detailing various uses of the term "burden of proof " among19th-century English and American courts).512us2$78J 01-08-98 12:23:11 PAGES OPINPGT273Cite as: 512 U. S. 267 (1994)Opinion of the CourtThe Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts was theleading proponent of the view that burden of proof should belimited to burden of persuasion. In what became an oft-cited case, Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw attempted to distinguish the burden of proof from the burden of producing evidence. Powers v. Russell, 30 Mass. 69 (1833). According tothe Massachusetts court, "the party whose case requires theproof of [a] fact, has all along the burden of proof." Id., at76. Though the burden of proving the fact remains whereit started, once the party with this burden establishes aprima facie case, the burden to "produce evidence" shifts.Ibid. The only time the burden of proof--as opposed to theburden to produce evidence--might shift is in the case ofaffirmative defenses. Id., at 77. In the century after Powers, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts continuedto carefully distinguish between the burden of proof and theburden of production. See, e. g., Smith v. Hill, 232 Mass.188, 122 N. E. 310 (1919).Despite the efforts of the Massachusetts court, the dualuse of the term continued throughout the late 19th and early20th centuries. See 4 J. Wigmore, Evidence $$ 2486-2487,pp. 3524-3529 (1905); Thayer, supra, at 355; 1 B. Elliott& W. Elliott, Law of Evidence $ 129, pp. 184-185 (1904); 2C. Chamberlayne, Modern Law of Evidence $ 936, pp. 1096-1098 (1911). The ambiguity confounded the treatise writers,who despaired over the "lamentable ambiguity of phraseand confusion of terminology under which our law has solong suffered." Wigmore, supra, at 3521-3522. The writers praised the "clear-thinking" efforts of courts like theSupreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, Chamberlayne,supra, at 1097, n. 3, and agreed that the legal professionshould endeavor to clarify one of its most basic terms. According to Thayer, supra, at 384-385, "[i]t seems impossibleto approve a continuance of the present state of things, underwhich such different ideas, of great practical importance andof frequent application, are indicated by this single ambigu512us2$78J 01-08-98 12:23:11 PAGES OPINPGT274 DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF WORKERS' COMPENSATIONPROGRAMS v. GREENWICH COLLIERIESOpinion of the Courtous expression." See also Chamberlayne, supra, at 1098.To remedy this problem, writers suggested that the term"burden of proof " be limited to the concept of burden of per-suasion, while some other term--such as "burden of proceeding" or "burden of evidence"--be used to refer to the conceptof burden of production. Chamberlayne, supra, $ 936; El-liott & Elliott,supra, at 185, n. 3. Despite the efforts atclarification, however, a dwindling number of courts contin-ued to obscure the distinction. See Annot., 2 A. L. R. 1672(1919) (noting that some courts still fail to properly distin-guish "between the burden of proof and the duty of goingforward with the evidence").This Court tried to eliminate the ambiguity in the term"burden of proof " when it adopted the Massachusetts approach. Hill v. Smith, 260 U. S. 592 (1923). Justice Holmeswrote for a unanimous Court that "it will not be necessaryto repeat the distinction, familiar in Massachusetts since thetime of Chief Justice Shaw, [Powers, supra], and elaboratedin the opinion below, between the burden of proof and thenecessity of producing evidence to meet that alreadyproduced. The distinction is now very generally accepted,although often blurred by careless speech." Id., at 594.In the two decades after Hill, our opinions consistentlydistinguished between burden of proof, which we defined asburden of persuasion, and an alternative concept, which weincreasingly referred to as the burden of production or theburden of going forward with the evidence. See, e. g., Brosnan v. Brosnan, 263 U. S. 345, 349 (1923) (imposition of burden of proof imposes the burden of persuasion, not simplythe burden of establishing a prima facie case); Radio Corp.of America v. Radio Engineering Laboratories, Inc., 293U. S. 1, 7-8 (1934) (party who bears the burden of proof"bears a heavy burden of persuasion"); Commercial Molasses Corp. v. New York Tank Barge Corp., 314 U. S. 104, 111(1941) (party with the burden of proof bears the "burden ofpersuasion," though the opposing party may bear a burden512us2$78J 01-08-98 12:23:11 PAGES OPINPGT275Cite as: 512 U. S. 267 (1994)Opinion of the Courtto "go forward with evidence"); Webre Steib Co. v. Commissioner, 324 U. S. 164, 171 (1945) (claimant bears a "burdenof going forward with evidence . . . as well as the burden ofproof ") (emphasis added). During this period the Courts ofAppeals also limited the meaning of burden of proof to burden of persuasion, and explicitly distinguished this conceptfrom the burden of production.*The emerging consensus on a definition of burden of proofwas reflected in the evidence treatises of the 1930's and1940's. "The burden of proof is the obligation which restson one of the parties to an action to persuade the trier of thefacts, generally the jury, of the truth of a proposition whichhe has affirmatively asserted by the pleadings." W. Richardson, Evidence 143 (6th ed. 1944); see also 1 B. Jones, Lawof Evidence in Civil Cases 310 (4th ed. 1938) ("The modernauthorities are substantially agreed that, in its strictprimary sense, `burden of proof ' signifies the duty or obligation of establishing, in the mind of the trier of facts, conviction on the ultimate issue"); J. McKelvey, Evidence 64 (4thed. 1932) ("[T]he proper meaning of [burden of proof]" is"the duty of the person alleging the case to prove it," ratherthan "the duty of the one party or the other to introduceevidence").We interpret Congress' use of the term "burden of proof "in light of this history, and presume Congress intended thephrase to have the meaning generally accepted in the legalcommunity at the time of enactment. Holmes v. SecuritiesInvestor Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 268 (1992);Miles v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U. S. 19, 32 (1990); Cannon*See, e. g., Lee v. State Bank & Trust Co., 38 F. 2d 45, 48 (CA2 1930);United States v. Knoles, 75 F. 2d 557, 561 (CA8 1935); Department ofWater and Power of Los Angeles v.

University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 696-698 (1979).These principles lead us to conclude that the drafters of theAPA used the term "burden of proof " to mean the burden ofpersuasion. As we have explained, though the term hadonce been ambiguous, that ambiguity had largely been eliminated by the early 20th century. After Hill, courts andcommentators almost unanimously agreed that the definitionwas settled. And Congress indicated that it shared this settled understanding, when in the Communications Act of 1934it explicitly distinguished between the burden of proof andthe burden of production. 47 U. S. C. $$ 309(e) and 312(d) (aparty has both the "burden of proceeding with the introduction of evidence and the burden of proof "). Accordingly, weconclude that as of 1946 the ordinary meaning of burden ofproof was burden of persuasion, and we understand theAPA's unadorned reference to "burden of proof " to refer tothe burden of persuasion.BWe recognize that we have previously asserted the contrary conclusion as to the meaning of burden of proof in $ 7(c)of the APA. In NLRB v. Transportation ManagementCorp., 462 U. S. 393 (1983), we reviewed the National LaborRelations Board's (NLRB's) conclusion that the employer haddischarged the employee because of the employee's protectedunion activity. In such cases the NLRB employed a burdenshifting formula typical in dual motive cases: The employeehad the burden of persuading the NLRB that antiunion animus contributed to the employer's firing decision; the burdenthen shifted to the employer to establish as an affirmativedefense that it would have fired the employee for permissiblereasons even if the employee had not been involved in unionactivity. Id., at 401-402. The employer claimed that theNLRB's burden shifting formula was inconsistent with theNational Labor Relations Act (NLRA), but we upheld it asa reasonable construction of the NLRA. Id., at 402-403.512us2$78J 01-08-98 12:23:11 PAGES OPINPGT277Cite as: 512 U. S. 267 (1994)Opinion of the CourtThe employer in Transportation Management argued thatthe NLRB's approach violated $ 7(c)'s burden of proof provision, which the employer read as imposing the burden of per-suasion on the employee. In a footnote, we summarily rejected this argument, concluding that "[$ 7(c)] . . . determinesonly the burden of going forward, not the burden of persua-sion.Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. EPA, [548 F. 2d998, 1004, 1013-1015 (CADC 1976)]." Id., at 404, n. 7. Inlight of our discussion in Part II-A above, we do not thinkour cursory conclusion in the Transportation Managementfootnote withstands scrutiny. The central issue inTransportation Management was whether the NLRB's burdenshifting approach was consistent with the NLRA. The parties and the amici in Transportation Management treatedthe APA argument as an afterthought, devoting only one ortwo sentences to the question. None of the briefs in thecase attempted to explain the ordinary meaning of the term.Transportation Management's cursory answer to an ancillary and largely unbriefed question does not warrant thesame level of deference we typically give our precedents.Moreover, Transportation Management reached its conclusion without referring to Steadman v. SEC, 450 U. S. 91(1981), our principal decision interpreting the meaning of$ 7(c). In Steadman we considered what standard of proof$ 7(c) required, and we held that the proponent of a rule ororder under $ 7(c) had to meet its burden by a preponderanceof the evidence, not by clear and convincing evidence.Though we did not explicitly state that $ 7(c) imposes theburden of persuasion on the party seeking the rule or order,our reasoning strongly implied that this must be so. Weassumed that burden of proof meant burden of persuasionwhen we said that we had to decide "the degree of proofwhich must be adduced by the proponent of a rule or orderto carry its burden of persuasion in an administrative proceeding." Id., at 95 (emphasis added). More important, ourholding that the party with the burden of proof must prove512us2$78J 01-08-98 12:23:11 PAGES OPINPGT278 DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF WORKERS' COMPENSATIONPROGRAMS v. GREENWICH COLLIERIESOpinion of the Courtits case by a preponderance only makes sense if the burdenof proof means the burden of persuasion. A standard ofproof, such as preponderance of the evidence, can apply onlyto a burden of persuasion, not to a burden of production.We do not slight the importance of adhering to precedent,particularly in a case involving statutory interpretation.But here our precedents are in tension, and we think ourapproach inSteadman makes more sense than does theTransportation Management footnote. And although wereject Transportation Management's reading of $ 7(c), theholding in that case remains intact. The NLRB's approachin Transportation Management is consistent with $ 7(c) be-cause the NLRB first required the employee to persuade itthat antiunion sentiment contributed to the employer's deci-sion. Only then did the NLRB place the burden of persuasion on the employer as to its affirmative defense.CIn addition to the Transportation Management footnote,the Department relies on the Senate and House JudiciaryCommittee Reports on the APA to support its claim thatburden of proof means only burden of production. SeeEn-vironmental Defense Fund v. EPA, 548 F. 2d, at 1014-1015(accepting this argument), cited in Transportation Manage-ment, supra, at 404, n. 7. We find this legislative historyunavailing. The Senate Judiciary Committee Report on theAPA states as follows:"That the proponent of a rule or order has the burdenof proof means not only that the party initiating the proceeding has the general burden of coming forward witha prima facie case but that other parties, who are proponents of some different result, also for that purpose havea burden to maintain. Similarly the requirement thatno sanction be imposed or rule or order be issued exceptupon evidence of the kind specified means that the proponents of a denial of relief must sustain such denial by512us2$78J 01-08-98 12:23:11 PAGES OPINPGT279Cite as: 512 U. S. 267 (1994)Opinion of the Courtthat kind of evidence. For example, credible and cred-ited evidence submitted by the applicant for a licensemay not be ignored except upon the requisite kind andquality of contrary evidence. No agency is authorizedto stand mute and arbitrarily disbelieve credible evi-dence. Except as applicants for a license or other privilege may be required to come forward with a prima facieshowing, no agency is entitled to presume that the conduct of any person or status of any enterprise is unlaw-ful or improper." S. Rep. No. 752, 79th Cong., 1st Sess.,22 (1945).The House Judiciary Committee Report contains identicallanguage, along with the following:"In other words, this section means that every propo-nent of a rule or order or the denial thereof has theburden of coming forward with sufficient evidence there-for; and in determining applications for licenses or otherrelief any fact, conduct, or status so shown by credibleand credited evidence must be accepted as true exceptas the contrary has been shown or such evidence hasbeen rebutted or impeached by duly credited evidenceor by facts officially noticed and stated." H. R. Rep.No. 1980, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 36 (1946).The Department argues that this legislative history indi-cates congressional intent to impose a burden of productionon the proponent. But even if that is so, it does not meanthat $ 7(c) is concernedonly with imposing a burden of pro-duction. That Congress intended to impose a burden of production does not mean that Congress did not also intend toimpose a burden of persuasion.Moreover, these passages are subject to a natural inter-pretation compatible with congressional intent to impose aburden of persuasion on the party seeking an order. Theprimary purpose of these passages is not to define or allocatethe burden of proof. The quoted passages are primarily512us2$78J 01-08-98 12:23:11 PAGES OPINPGT280 DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF WORKERS' COMPENSATIONPROGRAMS v. GREENWICH COLLIERIESOpinion of the Courtconcerned with the burden placed on the opponent in admin-istrative hearings ("other parties . . . have a burden to maintain"), particularly where the opponent is the Government.The Committee appeared concerned with those cases inwhich the "proponent" seeks a license or other privilege fromthe Government, and in such cases did not want to allowthe agency "to stand mute and arbitrarily disbelieve credibleevidence." The Reports make clear that once the licenseeestablishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the Gov-ernment to rebut it. This is perfectly compatible with a ruleplacing the burden of persuasion on the applicant, becausewhen the party with the burden of persuasion establishes aprima facie case supported by "credible and credited evi-dence," it must either be rebutted or accepted as true.The legislative history the Department relies on is impre-cise and only marginally relevant. Congress chose to usethe term "burden of proof " in the text of the statute, andgiven the substantial evidence that the ordinary meaning ofburden of proof was burden of persuasion, this legislativehistory cannot carry the day.DIn part due to Congress' recognition that claims such asthose involved here would be difficult to prove, claimants inadjudications under these statutes benefit from certain stat-utory presumptions easing their burden. See 33 U. S. C.$ 920; 30 U. S. C. $ 921(c); Del Vecchio v. Bowers, 296 U. S.280, 286 (1935). Similarly, the Department's solicitude forbenefits claimants is reflected in the regulations adoptingadditional presumptions. See 20 CFR $$ 718.301-718.306(1993); Mullins Coal, 484 U. S., at 158. But with the truedoubt rule the Department attempts to go one step further.In so doing, it runs afoul of the APA, a statute designed"to introduce greater uniformity of procedure and standardization of administrative practice among the diverse512us2$78J 01-08-98 12:23:11 PAGES OPINPGT281Cite as: 512 U. S. 267 (1994)Souter, J., dissentingagencies whose customs had departed widely from eachother." Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U. S. 33, 41(1950). That concern is directly implicated here, for underthe Department's reading each agency would be free to decide who shall bear the burden of persuasion. Accordingly,the Department cannot allocate the burden of persuasion ina manner that conflicts with the APA.IVUnder the Department's true doubt rule, when the evi-dence is evenly balanced the claimant wins. Under $ 7(c),however, when the evidence is evenly balanced, the benefitsclaimant must lose. Accordingly, we hold that the truedoubt rule violates $ 7(c) of the APA.Because we decide these cases on the basis of $ 7(c), weneed not address the Court of Appeals' holding in GreenwichCollieries that the true doubt rule conflicts with $ 718.403 orwith Mullins Coal, supra.
