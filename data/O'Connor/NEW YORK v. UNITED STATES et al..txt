These cases implicate one of our Nation's newest problemsof public policy and perhaps our oldest question of constitutional law. The public policy issue involves the disposal ofradioactive waste: In these cases, we address the constitutionality of three provisions of the Low-Level RadioactiveWaste Policy Amendments Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99-240, 99Stat. 1842, 42 U. S. C. $ 2021b et seq. The constitutionalquestion is as old as the Constitution: It consists of discerning the proper division of authority between the FederalGovernment and the States. We conclude that while Congress has substantial power under the Constitution to en-courage the States to provide for the disposal of the radioactive waste generated within their borders, the Constitutiondoes not confer upon Congress the ability simply to compelthe States to do so. We therefore find that only two of theAct's three provisions at issue are consistent with the Constitution's allocation of power to the Federal Government.IWe live in a world full of low level radioactive waste. Ra-dioactive material is present in luminous watch dials, smokealarms, measurement devices, medical fluids, research mate-rials, and the protective gear and construction materialsused by workers at nuclear power plants. Low level radio-active waste is generated by the Government, by hospitals,by research institutions, and by various industries.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtoften for hundreds of years. Millions of cubic feet of lowlevel radioactive waste must be disposed of each year. SeeApp. 110a-111a; Berkovitz, Waste Wars: Did Congress"Nuke" State Sovereignty in the Low-Level RadioactiveWaste Policy Amendments Act of 1985?, 11 Harv. Envtl. L.Rev. 437, 439-440 (1987).Our Nation's first site for the land disposal of commerciallow level radioactive waste opened in 1962 in Beatty, Nevada.Five more sites opened in the following decade: Maxey Flats,Kentucky (1963), West Valley, New York (1963), Hanford,Washington (1965), Sheffield, Illinois (1967), and Barnwell,South Carolina (1971). Between 1975 and 1978, the Illinoissite closed because it was full, and water management problems caused the closure of the sites in Kentucky and NewYork. As a result, since 1979 only three disposal sites--those in Nevada, Washington, and South Carolina--havebeen in operation. Waste generated in the rest of thecountry must be shipped to one of these three sites for disposal. See Low-Level Radioactive Waste Regulation 39-40(M. Burns ed. 1988).In 1979, both the Washington and Nevada sites wereforced to shut down temporarily, leaving South Carolina toshoulder the responsibility of storing low level radioactivewaste produced in every part of the country. The Governorof South Carolina, understandably perturbed, ordered a 50%reduction in the quantity of waste accepted at the Barnwellsite. The Governors of Washington and Nevada announcedplans to shut their sites permanently. App. 142a, 152a.Faced with the possibility that the Nation would be leftwith no disposal sites for low level radioactive waste, Congress responded by enacting the Low-Level RadioactiveWaste Policy Act, Pub. L. 96-573, 94 Stat. 3347. Relyinglargely on a report submitted by the National Governors'Association, see App. 105a-141a, Congress declared a federalpolicy of holding each State "responsible for providing forthe availability of capacity either within or outside the State505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT151Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of the Courtfor the disposal of low-level radioactive waste generatedwithin its borders," and found that such waste could be disposed of "most safely and efficiently . . . on a regional basis."$ 4(a)(1), 94 Stat. 3348. The 1980 Act authorized States toenter into regional compacts that, once ratified by Congress,would have the authority beginning in 1986 to restrict theuse of their disposal facilities to waste generated withinmember States. $ 4(a)(2)(B), 94 Stat. 3348. The 1980 Actincluded no penalties for States that failed to participate inthis plan.By 1985, only three approved regional compacts had operational disposal facilities; not surprisingly, these were thecompacts formed around South Carolina, Nevada, and Washington, the three sited States. The following year, the 1980Act would have given these three compacts the ability toexclude waste from nonmembers, and the remaining 31States would have had no assured outlet for their low levelradioactive waste. With this prospect looming, Congressonce again took up the issue of waste disposal. The resultwas the legislation challenged here, the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985.The 1985 Act was again based largely on a proposal submitted by the National Governors' Association. In broadoutline, the Act embodies a compromise among the sited andunsited States. The sited States agreed to extend for sevenyears the period in which they would accept low level radioactive waste from other States. In exchange, the unsitedStates agreed to end their reliance on the sited States by1992.The mechanics of this compromise are intricate. The Actdirects: "Each State shall be responsible for providing, eitherby itself or in cooperation with other States, for the disposalof . . . low-level radioactive waste generated within theState," 42 U. S. C. $ 2021c(a)(1)(A), with the exception ofcertain waste generated by the Federal Government,$$ 2021c(a)(1)(B), 2021c(b). The Act authorizes States to505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT152 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court"enter into such [interstate] compacts as may be neces-sary to provide for the establishment and operation ofregional disposal facilities for low-level radioactive waste."$ 2021d(a)(2). For an additional seven years beyond the period contemplated by the 1980 Act, from the beginning of1986 through the end of 1992, the three existing disposalsites "shall make disposal capacity available for low-levelradioactive waste generated by any source," with certainexceptions not relevant here. $ 2021e(a)(2). But the threeStates in which the disposal sites are located are permittedto exact a graduated surcharge for waste arriving from outside the regional compact--in 1986-1987, $10 per cubic foot;in 1988-1989, $20 per cubic foot; and in 1990-1992, $40 percubic foot. $ 2021e(d)(1). After the 7-year transition periodexpires, approved regional compacts may exclude radioactive waste generated outside the region. $ 2021d(c).The Act provides three types of incentives to encouragethe States to comply with their statutory obligation to provide for the disposal of waste generated within their borders.1. Monetary incentives. One quarter of the surchargescollected by the sited States must be transferred to anescrow account held by the Secretary of Energy. $ 2021e(d)(2)(A). The Secretary then makes payments from thisaccount to each State that has complied with a series of deadlines. By July 1, 1986, each State was to have ratified legislation either joining a regional compact or indicating an intent to develop a disposal facility within the State. $$ 2021e(e)(1)(A), 2021e(d)(2)(B)(i). By January 1, 1988, each unsitedcompact was to have identified the State in which its facilitywould be located, and each compact or stand-alone State wasto have developed a siting plan and taken other identifiedsteps. $$ 2021e(e)(1)(B), 2021e(d)(2)(B)(ii). By January 1,1990, each State or compact was to have filed a completeapplication for a license to operate a disposal facility, or theGovernor of any State that had not filed an application wasto have certified that the State would be capable of disposing505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT153Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of the Courtof all waste generated in the State after 1992. $$ 2021e(e)(1)(C), 2021e(d)(2)(B)(iii). The rest of the account is tobe paid out to those States or compacts able to dispose ofall low level radioactive waste generated within their borders by January 1, 1993. $ 2021e(d)(2)(B)(iv). Each Statethat has not met the 1993 deadline must either take titleto the waste generated within its borders or forfeit to thewaste generators the incentive payments it has received.$ 2021e(d)(2)(C).2.Access incentives. The second type of incentive in-volves the denial of access to disposal sites. States that failto meet the July 1986 deadline may be charged twice theordinary surcharge for the remainder of 1986 and may bedenied access to disposal facilities thereafter. $ 2021e(e)(2)(A). States that fail to meet the 1988 deadline may becharged double surcharges for the first half of 1988 and quad-ruple surcharges for the second half of 1988, and may bedenied access thereafter. $ 2021e(e)(2)(B). States that failto meet the 1990 deadline may be denied access. $ 2021e(e)(2)(C). Finally, States that have not filed complete ap-plications by January 1, 1992, for a license to operate a disposal facility, or States belonging to compacts that have notfiled such applications, may be charged triple surcharges.$$ 2021e(e)(1)(D), 2021e(e)(2)(D).3. The take title provision. The third type of incentiveis the most severe. The Act provides:"If a State (or, where applicable, a compact region) inwhich low-level radioactive waste is generated is unableto provide for the disposal of all such waste generatedwithin such State or compact region by January 1, 1996,each State in which such waste is generated, upon therequest of the generator or owner of the waste, shalltake title to the waste, be obligated to take possessionof the waste, and shall be liable for all damages directlyor indirectly incurred by such generator or owner as aconsequence of the failure of the State to take possession505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT154 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtof the waste as soon after January 1, 1996, as the generator or owner notifies the State that the waste is availablefor shipment." $ 2021e(d)(2)(C).These three incentives are the focus of petitioners' constitutional challenge.In the seven years since the Act took effect, Congress hasapproved nine regional compacts, encompassing 42 of theStates. All six unsited compacts and four of the unaffiliatedStates have met the first three statutory milestones. Brieffor United States 10, n. 19; id., at 13, n. 25.New York, a State whose residents generate a relativelylarge share of the Nation's low level radioactive waste, didnot join a regional compact. Instead, the State compliedwith the Act's requirements by enacting legislation providing for the siting and financing of a disposal facility in NewYork. The State has identified five potential sites, three inAllegany County and two in Cortland County. Residents ofthe two counties oppose the State's choice of location. App.29a-30a, 66a-68a.Petitioners--the State of New York and the two counties--filed this suit against the United States in 1990. Theysought a declaratory judgment that the Act is inconsistentwith the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments to the Constitution, with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment,and with the Guarantee Clause of Article IV of the Constitution. The States of Washington, Nevada, and South Carolina intervened as defendants. The District Court dismissed the complaint. 757 F. Supp. 10 (NDNY 1990). TheCourt of Appeals affirmed. 942 F. 2d 114 (CA2 1991). Petitioners have abandoned their due process and EleventhAmendment claims on their way up the appellate ladder; asthe cases stand before us, petitioners claim only that the Actis inconsistent with the Tenth Amendment and the Guarantee Clause.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT155Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of the CourtIIAIn 1788, in the course of explaining to the citizens of NewYork why the recently drafted Constitution provided for federal courts, Alexander Hamilton observed: "The erection ofa new government, whatever care or wisdom may distinguish the work, cannot fail to originate questions of intricacyand nicety; and these may, in a particular manner, be expected to flow from the the establishment of a constitutionfounded upon the total or partial incorporation of a numberof distinct sovereignties." The Federalist No. 82, p. 491 (C.Rossiter ed. 1961). Hamilton's prediction has proved quiteaccurate. While no one disputes the proposition that "[t]heConstitution created a Federal Government of limited powers," Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 457 (1991); and whilethe Tenth Amendment makes explicit that "[t]he powers notdelegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people"; the task of ascertaining the constitutional line between federal and state power has given rise tomany of the Court's most difficult and celebrated cases. Atleast as far back as Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304,324 (1816), the Court has resolved questions "of great importance and delicacy" in determining whether particular sovereign powers have been granted by the Constitution to theFederal Government or have been retained by the States.These questions can be viewed in either of two ways. Insome cases the Court has inquired whether an Act of Congress is authorized by one of the powers delegated to Congress in Article I of the Constitution. See, e. g., Perez v.United States, 402 U. S. 146 (1971); McCulloch v. Maryland,4 Wheat. 316 (1819). In other cases the Court has sought todetermine whether an Act of Congress invades the provinceof state sovereignty reserved by the Tenth Amendment.See, e. g., Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Au505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT156 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtthority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985); Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall.71 (1869). In a case like these, involving the division ofauthority between federal and state governments, the twoinquiries are mirror images of each other. If a power is delegated to Congress in the Constitution, the Tenth Amendment expressly disclaims any reservation of that power tothe States; if a power is an attribute of state sovereigntyreserved by the Tenth Amendment, it is necessarily a powerthe Constitution has not conferred on Congress. SeeUnitedStates v. Oregon, 366 U. S. 643, 649 (1961); Case v. Bowles,327 U. S. 92, 102 (1946);Oklahoma ex rel. Phillips v. Guy F.Atkinson Co., 313 U. S. 508, 534 (1941).It is in this sense that the Tenth Amendment "states but atruism that all is retained which has not been surrendered."United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 124 (1941). As JusticeStory put it, "[t]his amendment is a mere affirmation of what,upon any just reasoning, is a necessary rule of interpretingthe constitution. Being an instrument of limited and enumerated powers, it follows irresistibly, that what is not conferred, is withheld, and belongs to the state authorities." 3J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the UnitedStates 752 (1833). This has been the Court's consistent understanding: "The States unquestionably do retai[n] a significant measure of sovereign authority . . . to the extentthat the Constitution has not divested them of their originalpowers and transferred those powers to the Federal Government." Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, supra, at 549 (internal quotation marks omitted).Congress exercises its conferred powers subject to the limitations contained in the Constitution. Thus, for example,under the Commerce Clause Congress may regulate publishers engaged in interstate commerce, but Congress is constrained in the exercise of that power by the First Amendment. The Tenth Amendment likewise restrains the powerof Congress, but this limit is not derived from the text ofthe Tenth Amendment itself, which, as we have discussed,505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT157Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of the Courtis essentially a tautology. Instead, the Tenth Amendmentconfirms that the power of the Federal Government is subject to limits that may, in a given instance, reserve power tothe States. The Tenth Amendment thus directs us to determine, as in this case, whether an incident of state sovereignty is protected by a limitation on an Article I power.The benefits of this federal structure have been extensively cataloged elsewhere, see, e. g., Gregory v. Ashcroft,supra, at 457-460; Merritt, The Guarantee Clause and StateAutonomy: Federalism for a Third Century, 88 Colum. L.Rev. 1, 3-10 (1988); McConnell, Federalism: Evaluating theFounders' Design, 54 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1484, 1491-1511 (1987),but they need not concern us here. Our task would be thesame even if one could prove that federalism secured no advantages to anyone. It consists not of devising our preferred system of government, but of understanding andapplying the framework set forth in the Constitution. "Thequestion is not what power the Federal Government oughtto have but what powers in fact have been given by the people." United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1, 63 (1936).This framework has been sufficiently flexible over the pasttwo centuries to allow for enormous changes in the natureof government. The Federal Government undertakes activities today that would have been unimaginable to the Framers in two senses; first, because the Framers would not haveconceived that any government would conduct such activities; and second, because the Framers would not have believed that the Federal Government, rather than the States,would assume such responsibilities. Yet the powers conferred upon the Federal Government by the Constitutionwere phrased in language broad enough to allow for theexpansion of the Federal Government's role. Among theprovisions of the Constitution that have been particularlyimportant in this regard, three concern us here.First, the Constitution allocates to Congress the power"[t]o regulate Commerce . . . among the several States."505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT158 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtArt. I, $ 8, cl. 3. Interstate commerce was an establishedfeature of life in the late 18th century. See,e. g., The Federalist No. 42, p. 267 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) ("The defect ofpower in the existing Confederacy to regulate the commercebetween its several members [has] been clearly pointed outby experience"). The volume of interstate commerce andthe range of commonly accepted objects of government regulation have, however, expanded considerably in the last 200years, and the regulatory authority of Congress has expanded along with them. As interstate commerce has be-come ubiquitous, activities once considered purely local havecome to have effects on the national economy, and haveaccordingly come within the scope of Congress' commercepower. See, e. g., Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294(1964); Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942).Second, the Constitution authorizes Congress "to pay theDebts and provide for the . . . general Welfare of the UnitedStates." Art. I, $ 8, cl. 1. As conventional notions of theproper objects of government spending have changed overthe years, so has the ability of Congress to "fix the terms onwhich it shall disburse federal money to the States." Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1,17 (1981). Compare, e. g., United States v. Butler, supra, at72-75 (spending power does not authorize Congress to subsidize farmers), with South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203(1987) (spending power permits Congress to condition highway funds on States' adoption of minimum drinking age).While the spending power is "subject to several general restrictions articulated in our cases," id., at 207, these restrictions have not been so severe as to prevent the regulatoryauthority of Congress from generally keeping up with thegrowth of the federal budget.The Court's broad construction of Congress' power underthe Commerce and Spending Clauses has of course beenguided, as it has with respect to Congress' power generally,by the Constitution's Necessary and Proper Clause, which505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT159Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of the Courtauthorizes Congress "[t]o make all Laws which shall be nec-essary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoingPowers." U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 18. See, e. g., LegalTender Case, 110 U. S. 421, 449-450 (1884); McCulloch v.Maryland, 4 Wheat., at 411-421.Finally, the Constitution provides that "the Laws of theUnited States . . . shall be the supreme Law of the Land . . .any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to theContrary notwithstanding." U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. Asthe Federal Government's willingness to exercise powerwithin the confines of the Constitution has grown, the au-thority of the States has correspondingly diminished to theextent that federal and state policies have conflicted. See,e. g., Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85 (1983). Wehave observed that the Supremacy Clause gives the FederalGovernment "a decided advantage in th[e] delicate balance"the Constitution strikes between state and federal power.Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S., at 460.The actual scope of the Federal Government's authoritywith respect to the States has changed over the years, therefore, but the constitutional structure underlying and limitingthat authority has not. In the end, just as a cup may be halfempty or half full, it makes no difference whether one viewsthe question at issue in these cases as one of ascertainingthe limits of the power delegated to the Federal Governmentunder the affirmative provisions of the Constitution or oneof discerning the core of sovereignty retained by the Statesunder the Tenth Amendment. Either way, we must determine whether any of the three challenged provisions ofthe Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Actof 1985 oversteps the boundary between federal and stateauthority.BPetitioners do not contend that Congress lacks the powerto regulate the disposal of low level radioactive waste.Space in radioactive waste disposal sites is frequently sold505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT160 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtby residents of one State to residents of another. Regula-tion of the resulting interstate market in waste disposal istherefore well within Congress' authority under the Com-merce Clause. Cf.Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S.617, 621-623 (1978); Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v.Michigan Dept. of Natural Resources, 504 U. S. 353, 359(1992). Petitioners likewise do not dispute that under theSupremacy Clause Congress could, if it wished, pre-emptstate radioactive waste regulation. Petitioners contendonly that the Tenth Amendment limits the power of Con-gress to regulate in the way it has chosen. Rather than addressing the problem of waste disposal by directly regulatingthe generators and disposers of waste, petitioners argue,Congress has impermissibly directed the States to regulatein this field.Most of our recent cases interpreting the Tenth Amendment have concerned the authority of Congress to subjectstate governments to generally applicable laws. TheCourt's jurisprudence in this area has traveled an unsteadypath. See Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968) (stateschools and hospitals are subject to Fair Labor StandardsAct); National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976)(overruling Wirtz) (state employers are not subject to FairLabor Standards Act); Garcia v. San Antonio MetropolitanTransit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985) (overruling NationalLeague of Cities) (state employers are once again subject toFair Labor Standards Act). See also New York v. UnitedStates, 326 U. S. 572 (1946); Fry v. United States, 421 U. S.542 (1975); Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455U. S. 678 (1982); EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226 (1983);South Carolina v. Baker, 485 U. S. 505 (1988); Gregory v.Ashcroft, supra. This litigation presents no occasion toapply or revisit the holdings of any of these cases, as this isnot a case in which Congress has subjected a State to thesame legislation applicable to private parties. Cf. FERC v.Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 758-759 (1982).505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT161Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of the CourtThis litigation instead concerns the circumstances underwhich Congress may use the States as implements of regulation; that is, whether Congress may direct or otherwise moti-vate the States to regulate in a particular field or a particularway. Our cases have established a few principles that guideour resolution of the issue.1As an initial matter, Congress may not simply "comman-dee[r] the legislative processes of the States by directly compelling them to enact and enforce a federal regulatory pro-gram." Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & ReclamationAssn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 288 (1981). In Hodel, the Courtupheld the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of1977 precisely because it did not "commandeer" the Statesinto regulating mining. The Court found that "the Statesare not compelled to enforce the steep-slope standards, toexpend any state funds, or to participate in the federal regulatory program in any manner whatsoever. If a State doesnot wish to submit a proposed permanent program that complies with the Act and implementing regulations, the full reg-ulatory burden will be borne by the Federal Government."Ibid.The Court reached the same conclusion the following yearin FERC v. Mississippi, supra. At issue in FERC was thePublic Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, a federal statute encouraging the States in various ways to develop pro-grams to combat the Nation's energy crisis. We observedthat "this Court never has sanctioned explicitly a federalcommand to the States to promulgate and enforce laws andregulations." Id., at 761-762. As in Hodel, the Court up-held the statute at issue because it did not view the statuteas such a command. The Court emphasized: "Titles I andIII of [the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978(PURPA)] require only consideration of federal standards.And if a State has no utilities commission, or simply stopsregulating in the field, it need not even entertain the federal505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT162 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtproposals." 456 U. S., at 764 (emphasis in original). Be-cause "[t]here [wa]s nothing in PURPA `directly compelling'the States to enact a legislative program," the statute wasnot inconsistent with the Constitution's division of authoritybetween the Federal Government and the States. Id., at765 (quoting Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., supra, at 288). See also South Carolina v.Baker, supra, at 513 (noting "the possibility that the TenthAmendment might set some limits on Congress' power tocompel States to regulate on behalf of federal interests");Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,supra, at 556 (same).These statements in FERC and Hodel were not innovations. While Congress has substantial powers to govern theNation directly, including in areas of intimate concern to theStates, the Constitution has never been understood to conferupon Congress the ability to require the States to governaccording to Congress' instructions. See Coyle v. Smith,221 U. S. 559, 565 (1911). The Court has been explicit aboutthis distinction. "Both the States and the United States existed before the Constitution. The people, through that instrument, established a more perfect union by substitutinga national government, acting, with ample power, directlyupon the citizens, instead of the Confederate government,which acted with powers, greatly restricted, only upon theStates." Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall., at 76 (emphasisadded). The Court has made the same point with more rhetorical flourish, although perhaps with less precision, on anumber of occasions. In Chief Justice Chase's much-quotedwords, "the preservation of the States, and the maintenanceof their governments, are as much within the design and careof the Constitution as the preservation of the Union and themaintenance of the National government. The Constitution, in all its provisions, looks to an indestructible Union,composed of indestructible States." Texas v. White, 7 Wall.700, 725 (1869). See also Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT163Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of the CourtU. S. 514, 523 (1926) ("[N]either government may destroy theother nor curtail in any substantial manner the exercise ofits powers"); Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U. S. 455, 458 (1990)("[U]nder our federal system, the States possess sovereigntyconcurrent with that of the Federal Government"); Gregoryv. Ashcroft, 501 U. S., at 461 ("[T]he States retain substantialsovereign powers under our constitutional scheme, powerswith which Congress does not readily interfere").Indeed, the question whether the Constitution should permit Congress to employ state governments as regulatoryagencies was a topic of lively debate among the Framers.Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress lacked theauthority in most respects to govern the people directly. Inpractice, Congress "could not directly tax or legislate uponindividuals; it had no explicit `legislative' or `governmental'power to make binding `law' enforceable as such." Amar, OfSovereignty and Federalism, 96 Yale L. J. 1425, 1447 (1987).The inadequacy of this governmental structure was responsible in part for the Constitutional Convention. Alexander Hamilton observed: "The great and radical vice in theconstruction of the existing Confederation is in the principleof legislation for states or governments, in their corporate or collective capacities, and as contradistinguished from the individuals of whom they consist." TheFederalist No. 15, p. 108 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). As Hamiltonsaw it, "we must resolve to incorporate into our plan thoseingredients which may be considered as forming the characteristic difference between a league and a government; wemust extend the authority of the Union to the persons of thecitizens--the only proper objects of government." Id., at109. The new National Government "must carry its agencyto the persons of the citizens. It must stand in need ofno intermediate legislations . . . . The government ofthe Union, like that of each State, must be able to addressitself immediately to the hopes and fears of individuals."Id., No. 16, at 116.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT164 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtThe Convention generated a great number of proposals forthe structure of the new Government, but two quickly tookcenter stage. Under the Virginia Plan, as first introducedby Edmund Randolph, Congress would exercise legislativeauthority directly upon individuals, without employing theStates as intermediaries. 1 Records of the Federal Conven-tion of 1787, p. 21 (M. Farrand ed. 1911). Under the NewJersey Plan, as first introduced by William Paterson, Con-gress would continue to require the approval of the Statesbefore legislating, as it had under the Articles of Confedera-tion. 1id., at 243-244. These two plans underwent variousrevisions as the Convention progressed, but they remainedthe two primary options discussed by the delegates. Onefrequently expressed objection to the New Jersey Plan wasthat it might require the Federal Government to coerce theStates into implementing legislation. As Randolph explained the distinction, "[t]he true question is whether weshall adhere to the federal plan [i. e., the New Jersey Plan],or introduce the national plan. The insufficiency of the former has been fully displayed . . . . There are but two modes,by which the end of a Gen[eral] Gov[ernment] can be attained: the 1st is by coercion as proposed by Mr. P[aterson's]plan[, the 2nd] by real legislation as prop[osed] by the otherplan. Coercion [is] impracticable, expensive, cruel to individuals. . . . We must resort therefore to a national Legislation over individuals." 1 id., at 255-256 (emphasis inoriginal). Madison echoed this view: "The practicability ofmaking laws, with coercive sanctions, for the States as political bodies, had been exploded on all hands." 2 id., at 9.Under one preliminary draft of what would become theNew Jersey Plan, state governments would occupy a positionrelative to Congress similar to that contemplated by the Actat issue in these cases: "[T]he laws of the United States ought,as far as may be consistent with the common interests ofthe Union, to be carried into execution by the judiciary andexecutive officers of the respective states, wherein the exe505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT165Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of the Courtcution thereof is required." 3 id., at 616. This idea appar-ently never even progressed so far as to be debated by thedelegates, as contemporary accounts of the Convention donot mention any such discussion. The delegates' many descriptions of the Virginia and New Jersey Plans speak onlyin general terms about whether Congress was to derive itsauthority from the people or from the States, and whether itwas to issue directives to individuals or to States. See 1 id.,at 260-280.In the end, the Convention opted for a Constitution inwhich Congress would exercise its legislative authority directly over individuals rather than over States; for a varietyof reasons, it rejected the New Jersey Plan in favor of theVirginia Plan. 1 id., at 313. This choice was made clear tothe subsequent state ratifying conventions. Oliver Ellsworth, a member of the Connecticut delegation in Philadelphia, explained the distinction to his State's convention:"This Constitution does not attempt to coerce sovereign bodies, states, in their political capacity. . . . But this legal coercion singles out the . . . individual." 2 J. Elliot, Debates onthe Federal Constitution 197 (2d ed. 1863). Charles Pinckney, another delegate at the Constitutional Convention, emphasized to the South Carolina House of Representativesthat in Philadelphia "the necessity of having a governmentwhich should at once operate upon the people, and not uponthe states, was conceived to be indispensable by every delegation present." 4 id., at 256. Rufus King, one of Massachusetts' delegates, returned home to support ratification byrecalling the Commonwealth's unhappy experience under theArticles of Confederation and arguing: "Laws, to be effective, therefore, must not be laid on states, but upon individuals." 2 id., at 56. At New York's convention, Hamilton (another delegate in Philadelphia) exclaimed: "But can webelieve that one state will ever suffer itself to be used as aninstrument of coercion? The thing is a dream; it is impossible. Then we are brought to this dilemma--either a federal505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT166 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtstanding army is to enforce the requisitions, or the federaltreasury is left without supplies, and the government without support. What, sir, is the cure for this great evil?Nothing, but to enable the national laws to operate on individuals, in the same manner as those of the states do." 2id., at 233. At North Carolina's convention, Samuel Spencerrecognized that "all the laws of the Confederation were binding on the states in their political capacities, . . . but nowthe thing is entirely different. The laws of Congress will bebinding on individuals." 4 id., at 153.In providing for a stronger central government, therefore,the Framers explicitly chose a Constitution that confers uponCongress the power to regulate individuals, not States. Aswe have seen, the Court has consistently respected thischoice. We have always understood that even where Congress has the authority under the Constitution to pass lawsrequiring or prohibiting certain acts, it lacks the power directly to compel the States to require or prohibit those acts.E. g., FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S., at 762-766; Hodel v.Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452U. S., at 288-289; Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall., at 76.The allocation of power contained in the Commerce Clause,for example, authorizes Congress to regulate interstate commerce directly; it does not authorize Congress to regulatestate governments' regulation of interstate commerce.2This is not to say that Congress lacks the ability to encourage a State to regulate in a particular way, or that Congressmay not hold out incentives to the States as a method ofinfluencing a State's policy choices. Our cases have identified a variety of methods, short of outright coercion, bywhich Congress may urge a State to adopt a legislativeprogram consistent with federal interests. Two of thesemethods are of particular relevance here.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:07 PAGES OPINPGT167Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of the CourtFirst, under Congress' spending power, "Congress may at-tach conditions on the receipt of federal funds."South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S., at 206. Such conditions must (amongother requirements) bear some relationship to the purposeof the federal spending, id., at 207-208, and n. 3; otherwise,of course, the spending power could render academic theConstitution's other grants and limits of federal authority.Where the recipient of federal funds is a State, as is notunusual today, the conditions attached to the funds byCongress may influence a State's legislative choices. SeeKaden, Politics, Money, and State Sovereignty: The JudicialRole, 79 Colum. L. Rev. 847, 874-881 (1979). Dole was onesuch case: The Court found no constitutional flaw in a federalstatute directing the Secretary of Transportation to withhold federal highway funds from States failing to adopt Congress' choice of a minimum drinking age. Similar examplesabound. See, e. g., Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448,478-480 (1980); Massachusetts v. United States, 435 U. S.444, 461-462 (1978); Lau v. Nichols, 414 U. S. 563, 568-569(1974); Oklahoma v. United States Civil Service Comm'n,330 U. S. 127, 142-144 (1947).Second, where Congress has the authority to regulate private activity under the Commerce Clause, we have recognized Congress' power to offer States the choice of regulating that activity according to federal standards or havingstate law pre-empted by federal regulation. Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., supra, at288. See also FERC v. Mississippi, supra, at 764-765.This arrangement, which has been termed "a program of cooperative federalism," Hodel, supra, at 289, is replicated innumerous federal statutory schemes. These include theClean Water Act, 86 Stat. 816, as amended, 33 U. S. C. $ 1251et seq., see Arkansas v. Oklahoma, 503 U. S. 91, 101 (1992)(Clean Water Act "anticipates a partnership between theStates and the Federal Government, animated by a sharedobjective"); the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970,505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT168 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court84 Stat. 1590, 29 U. S. C. $ 651 et seq., see Gade v. NationalSolid Wastes Management Assn., ante, at 97; the ResourceConservation and Recovery Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 2796, asamended, 42 U. S. C. $ 6901et seq., see Department of Energyv. Ohio, 503 U.

Alaska,860 F. 2d 312, 314 (CA9 1988), cert. denied, 491 U. S. 905(1989).By either of these methods, as by any other permissiblemethod of encouraging a State to conform to federal policychoices, the residents of the State retain the ultimate decision as to whether or not the State will comply. If a State'scitizens view federal policy as sufficiently contrary to localinterests, they may elect to decline a federal grant. If stateresidents would prefer their government to devote its attention and resources to problems other than those deemed important by Congress, they may choose to have the FederalGovernment rather than the State bear the expense of a federally mandated regulatory program, and they may continueto supplement that program to the extent state law is notpre-empted. Where Congress encourages state regulationrather than compelling it, state governments remain responsive to the local electorate's preferences; state officials remain accountable to the people.By contrast, where the Federal Government compelsStates to regulate, the accountability of both state and federal officials is diminished. If the citizens of New York, forexample, do not consider that making provision for the disposal of radioactive waste is in their best interest, they mayelect state officials who share their view. That view can always be pre-empted under the Supremacy Clause if it is contrary to the national view, but in such a case it is the FederalGovernment that makes the decision in full view of the public, and it will be federal officials that suffer the consequencesif the decision turns out to be detrimental or unpopular.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT169Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of the CourtBut where the Federal Government directs the States toregulate, it may be state officials who will bear the brunt ofpublic disapproval, while the federal officials who devised theregulatory program may remain insulated from the electoralramifications of their decision. Accountability is thus dimin-ished when, due to federal coercion, elected state officialscannot regulate in accordance with the views of the localelectorate in matters not pre-empted by federal regulation.See Merritt, 88 Colum. L. Rev., at 61-62; La Pierre, PoliticalAccountability in the National Political Process--The Alternative to Judicial Review of Federalism Issues, 80 Nw. U. L.Rev. 577, 639-665 (1985).With these principles in mind, we turn to the three chal-lenged provisions of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985.IIIThe parties in these cases advance two quite different viewsof the Act. As petitioners see it, the Act imposes a requirement directly upon the States that they regulate in the fieldof radioactive waste disposal in order to meet Congress'mandate that "[e]ach State shall be responsible for providing. . . for the disposal of . . . low-level radioactive waste." 42U. S. C. $ 2021c(a)(1)(A). Petitioners understand this provi-sion as a direct command from Congress, enforceable independent of the three sets of incentives provided by the Act.Respondents, on the other hand, read this provision togetherwith the incentives, and see the Act as affording the Statesthree sets of choices. According to respondents, the Actpermits a State to choose first between regulating pursuantto federal standards and losing the right to a share of theSecretary of Energy's escrow account; to choose second be-tween regulating pursuant to federal standards and progressively losing access to disposal sites in other States; and tochoose third between regulating pursuant to federal standards and taking title to the waste generated within the State.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT170 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtRespondents thus interpret $ 2021c(a)(1)(A), despite the statute's use of the word "shall," to provide no more than anoption which a State may elect or eschew.The Act could plausibly be understood either as a mandateto regulate or as a series of incentives. Under petitioners'view, however, $ 2021c(a)(1)(A) of the Act would clearly"commandee[r] the legislative processes of the States by directly compelling them to enact and enforce a federal regulatory program." Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S., at 288. We must reject thisinterpretation of the provision for two reasons. First, suchan outcome would, to say the least, "upset the usual constitutional balance of federal and state powers." Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S., at 460. "[I]t is incumbent upon the federalcourts to be certain of Congress' intent before finding thatfederal law overrides this balance," ibid. (internal quotationmarks omitted), but the Act's amenability to an equally plausible alternative construction prevents us from possessingsuch certainty. Second, "where an otherwise acceptableconstruction of a statute would raise serious constitutionalproblems, the Court will construe the statute to avoid suchproblems unless such construction is plainly contrary to theintent of Congress." Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. FloridaGulf Coast Building & Construction Trades Council, 485U. S. 568, 575 (1988). This rule of statutory constructionpushes us away from petitioners' understanding of $ 2021c(a)(1)(A) of the Act, under which it compels the States toregulate according to Congress' instructions.We therefore decline petitioners' invitation to construe$ 2021c(a)(1)(A), alone and in isolation, as a command to theStates independent of the remainder of the Act. Construedas a whole, the Act comprises three sets of "incentives" forthe States to provide for the disposal of low level radioactivewaste generated within their borders. We consider each inturn.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT171Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of the CourtAThe first set of incentives works in three steps. First,Congress has authorized States with disposal sites to imposea surcharge on radioactive waste received from other States.Second, the Secretary of Energy collects a portion of thissurcharge and places the money in an escrow account.Third, States achieving a series of milestones receive portions of this fund.The first of these steps is an unexceptionable exercise ofCongress' power to authorize the States to burden interstatecommerce. While the Commerce Clause has long been understood to limit the States' ability to discriminate againstinterstate commerce, see, e. g., Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502U. S. 437, 454-455 (1992); Cooley v. Board of Wardens of Portof Philadelphia ex rel. Society for Relief of Distressed Pilots, 12 How. 299 (1852), that limit may be lifted, as it hasbeen here, by an expression of the "unambiguous intent" ofCongress. Wyoming, supra, at 458; Prudential Ins. Co. v.Benjamin, 328 U. S. 408, 427-431 (1946). Whether or notthe States would be permitted to burden the interstatetransport of low level radioactive waste in the absence ofCongress' approval, the States can clearly do so with Congress' approval, which is what the Act gives them.The second step, the Secretary's collection of a percentageof the surcharge, is no more than a federal tax on interstatecommerce, which petitioners do not claim to be an invalidexercise of either Congress' commerce or taxing power. Cf.United States v. Sanchez, 340 U. S. 42, 44-45 (1950); StewardMachine Co. v. Davis, 301 U. S. 548, 581-583 (1937).The third step is a conditional exercise of Congress' au-thority under the Spending Clause: Congress has placed conditions--the achievement of the milestones--on the receiptof federal funds. Petitioners do not contend that Congresshas exceeded its authority in any of the four respects ourcases have identified. See generallySouth Dakota v. Dole,483 U. S., at 207-208. The expenditure is for the general505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT172 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtwelfare, Helvering v. Davis, 301 U. S. 619, 640-641 (1937);the States are required to use the money they receive forthe purpose of assuring the safe disposal of radioactivewaste. 42 U. S. C. $ 2021e(d)(2)(E). The conditions imposedare unambiguous, Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.Halderman, 451 U. S., at 17; the Act informs the States ex-actly what they must do and by when they must do it inorder to obtain a share of the escrow account. The condi-tions imposed are reasonably related to the purpose of theexpenditure, Massachusetts v. United States, 435 U. S., at461; both the conditions and the payments embody Congress'efforts to address the pressing problem of radioactive wastedisposal. Finally, petitioners do not claim that the conditions imposed by the Act violate any independent constitutional prohibition. Lawrence County v. Lead-DeadwoodSchool Dist. No. 40-1, 469 U. S. 256, 269-270 (1985).Petitioners contend nevertheless that the form of theseexpenditures removes them from the scope of Congress'spending power. Petitioners emphasize the Act's instruction to the Secretary of Energy to "deposit all funds receivedin a special escrow account. The funds so deposited shallnot be the property of the United States." 42 U. S. C.$ 2021e(d)(2)(A). Petitioners argue that because the moneycollected and redisbursed to the States is kept in an accountseparate from the general treasury, because the Secretaryholds the funds only as a trustee, and because the Statesthemselves are largely able to control whether they will payinto the escrow account or receive a share, the Act "in nomanner calls for the spending of federal funds." ReplyBrief for Petitioner State of New York 6.The Constitution's grant to Congress of the authority to"pay the Debts and provide for the . . . general Welfare" hasnever, however, been thought to mandate a particular formof accounting. A great deal of federal spending comes fromsegregated trust funds collected and spent for a particularpurpose. See, e. g., 23 U. S. C. $ 118 (Highway Trust Fund);505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT173Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of the Court42 U. S. C. $ 401(a) (Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insur-ance Trust Fund); 42 U. S. C. $ 401(b) (Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund); 42 U. S. C. $ 1395t (Federal Supplemen-tary Medical Insurance Trust Fund). The Spending Clausehas never been construed to deprive Congress of the powerto structure federal spending in this manner. Petitioners'argument regarding the States' ability to determine the es-crow account's income and disbursements ignores the factthat Congress specifically provided the States with this abil-ity as a method of encouraging the States to regulate according to the federal plan. That the States are able to choosewhether they will receive federal funds does not make theresulting expenditures any less federal; indeed, the locationof such choice in the States is an inherent element in anyconditional exercise of Congress' spending power.The Act's first set of incentives, in which Congress hasconditioned grants to the States upon the States' attainmentof a series of milestones, is thus well within the authority ofCongress under the Commerce and Spending Clauses. Be-cause the first set of incentives is supported by affirmativeconstitutional grants of power to Congress, it is not incon-sistent with the Tenth Amendment.BIn the second set of incentives, Congress has authorizedStates and regional compacts with disposal sites graduallyto increase the cost of access to the sites, and then to denyaccess altogether, to radioactive waste generated in Statesthat do not meet federal deadlines. As a simple regulation,this provision would be within the power of Congress to authorize the States to discriminate against interstate com-merce. See Northeast Bancorp, Inc. v. Board of Governors,FRS, 472 U. S. 159, 174-175 (1985). Where federal regula-tion of private activity is within the scope of the CommerceClause, we have recognized the ability of Congress to offerStates the choice of regulating that activity according to fed505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT174 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courteral standards or having state law pre-empted by federalregulation. See Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S., at 288; FERC v. Mississippi,456 U. S., at 764-765.This is the choice presented to nonsited States by the Act'ssecond set of incentives: States may either regulate the disposal of radioactive waste according to federal standards byattaining local or regional self-sufficiency, or their residentswho produce radioactive waste will be subject to federal reg-ulation authorizing sited States and regions to deny accessto their disposal sites. The affected States are not com-pelled by Congress to regulate, because any burden causedby a State's refusal to regulate will fall on those who gener-ate waste and find no outlet for its disposal, rather than onthe State as a sovereign. A State whose citizens do notwish it to attain the Act's milestones may devote its attentionand its resources to issues its citizens deem more worthy;the choice remains at all times with the residents of theState, not with Congress. The State need not expend anyfunds, or participate in any federal program, if local residentsdo not view such expenditures or participation as worth-while. Cf.Hodel, supra, at 288. Nor must the State aban-don the field if it does not accede to federal direction; theState may continue to regulate the generation and disposalof radioactive waste in any manner its citizens see fit.The Act's second set of incentives thus represents a con-ditional exercise of Congress' commerce power, along thelines of those we have held to be within Congress' author-ity. As a result, the second set of incentives does not intrude on the sovereignty reserved to the States by theTenth Amendment.CThe take title provision is of a different character. Thisthird so-called "incentive" offers States, as an alternative toregulating pursuant to Congress' direction, the option of tak-ing title to and possession of the low level radioactive waste505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT175Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of the Courtgenerated within their borders and becoming liable for alldamages waste generators suffer as a result of the States'failure to do so promptly. In this provision, Congress hascrossed the line distinguishing encouragement from coercion.We must initially reject respondents' suggestion that, because the take title provision will not take effect until Janu-ary 1, 1996, petitioners' challenge thereto is unripe. It takesmany years to develop a new disposal site. All parties agreethat New York must take action now in order to avoid thetake title provision's consequences, and no party suggeststhat the State's waste generators will have ceased producingwaste by 1996. The issue is thus ripe for review. Cf. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Comm'n, 461 U. S. 190, 201 (1983);Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U. S. 102, 144-145 (1974).The take title provision offers state governments a"choice" of either accepting ownership of waste or regulatingaccording to the instructions of Congress. Respondents donot claim that the Constitution would authorize Congress toimpose either option as a freestanding requirement. On onehand, the Constitution would not permit Congress simply totransfer radioactive waste from generators to state governments. Such a forced transfer, standing alone, would inprinciple be no different than a congressionally compelledsubsidy from state governments to radioactive waste producers. The same is true of the provision requiring the Statesto become liable for the generators' damages. Standingalone, this provision would be indistinguishable from an Actof Congress directing the States to assume the liabilities ofcertain state residents. Either type of federal action would"commandeer" state governments into the service of federalregulatory purposes, and would for this reason be inconsistent with the Constitution's division of authority between federal and state governments. On the other hand, the secondalternative held out to state governments--regulating pur505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT176 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtsuant to Congress' direction--would, standing alone, presenta simple command to state governments to implement legislation enacted by Congress. As we have seen, the Constitu-tion does not empower Congress to subject state governments to this type of instruction.Because an instruction to state governments to take titleto waste, standing alone, would be beyond the authority ofCongress, and because a direct order to regulate, standingalone, would also be beyond the authority of Congress, itfollows that Congress lacks the power to offer the States achoice between the two. Unlike the first two sets of incentives, the take title incentive does not represent the conditional exercise of any congressional power enumerated in theConstitution. In this provision, Congress has not held outthe threat of exercising its spending power or its commercepower; it has instead held out the threat, should the Statesnot regulate according to one federal instruction, of simplyforcing the States to submit to another federal instruction.A choice between two unconstitutionally coercive regulatorytechniques is no choice at all. Either way, "the Act commandeers the legislative processes of the States by directlycompelling them to enact and enforce a federal regulatoryprogram," Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & ReclamationAssn., Inc., supra, at 288, an outcome that has never beenunderstood to lie within the authority conferred upon Congress by the Constitution.Respondents emphasize the latitude given to the States toimplement Congress' plan. The Act enables the States toregulate pursuant to Congress' instructions in any numberof different ways. States may avoid taking title by contracting with sited regional compacts, by building a disposalsite alone or as part of a compact, or by permitting privateparties to build a disposal site. States that host sites mayemploy a wide range of designs and disposal methods, subject only to broad federal regulatory limits. This line of reasoning, however, only underscores the critical alternative a505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT177Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of the CourtState lacks: A State may not decline to administer the fed-eral program. No matter which path the State chooses, itmust follow the direction of Congress.The take title provision appears to be unique. No otherfederal statute has been cited which offers a state govern-ment no option other than that of implementing legislationenacted by Congress. Whether one views the take title pro-vision as lying outside Congress' enumerated powers, or asinfringing upon the core of state sovereignty reserved bythe Tenth Amendment, the provision is inconsistent with thefederal structure of our Government established by theConstitution.IVRespondents raise a number of objections to this under-standing of the limits of Congress' power.AThe United States proposes three alternative views of theconstitutional line separating state and federal authority.While each view concedes that Congress generally may notcompel state governments to regulate pursuant to federaldirection, each purports to find a limited domain in whichsuch coercion is permitted by the Constitution.First, the United States argues that the Constitution'sprohibition of congressional directives to state governmentscan be overcome where the federal interest is sufficientlyimportant to justify state submission. This argument contains a kernel of truth: In determining whether the TenthAmendment limits the ability of Congress to subject stategovernments to generally applicable laws, the Court has insome cases stated that it will evaluate the strength of federalinterests in light of the degree to which such laws wouldprevent the State from functioning as a sovereign; that is,the extent to which such generally applicable laws would im-pede a state government's responsibility to represent and beaccountable to the citizens of the State. See, e. g., EEOC v.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT178 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtWyoming, 460 U. S., at 242, n. 17; Transportation Union v.Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S., at 684, n. 9; National Leagueof Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S., at 853. The Court has morerecently departed from this approach. See,e. g., South Carolina v. Baker, 485 U. S., at 512-513; Garcia v. San AntonioMetropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S., at 556-557. Butwhether or not a particularly strong federal interest enablesCongress to bring state governments within the orbit of gen-erally applicablefederal regulation, no Member of the Courthas ever suggested that such a federal interest would enableCongress to command a state government to enactstate regulation. No matter how powerful the federal interest involved, the Constitution simply does not give Congress theauthority to require the States to regulate. The Constitution instead gives Congress the authority to regulate matters directly and to pre-empt contrary state regulation.Where a federal interest is sufficiently strong to cause Congress to legislate, it must do so directly; it may not conscriptstate governments as its agents.Second, the United States argues that the Constitutiondoes, in some circumstances, permit federal directives tostate governments. Various cases are cited for this proposition, but none support it. Some of these cases discuss thewell established power of Congress to pass laws enforceablein state courts. See Testa v. Katt, 330 U. S. 386 (1947);Palmore v. United States, 411 U. S. 389, 402 (1973); see alsoSecond Employers' Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 1, 57 (1912);Claflin v. Houseman, 93 U. S. 130, 136-137 (1876). Thesecases involve no more than an application of the SupremacyClause's provision that federal law "shall be the supremeLaw of the Land," enforceable in every State. More to thepoint, all involve congressional regulation of individuals, notcongressional requirements that States regulate. Federalstatutes enforceable in state courts do, in a sense, directstate judges to enforce them, but this sort of federal "direction" of state judges is mandated by the text of the Suprem505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT179Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of the Courtacy Clause. No comparable constitutional provision author-izes Congress to command state legislatures to legislate.Additional cases cited by the United States discuss thepower of federalcourts to order state officials to comply withfederal law. See Puerto Rico v. Branstad, 483 U. S. 219, 228(1987); Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U. S. 658, 695 (1979); Illinois v. City of Milwaukee, 406 U. S. 91, 106-108 (1972); seealsoCooper v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1, 18-19 (1958); Brown v.Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294, 300 (1955); Ex parteYoung, 209 U. S. 123, 155-156 (1908). Again, however, thetext of the Constitution plainly confers this authority on thefederal courts, the "judicial Power" of which "shall extendto all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, [and] the Laws of the United States . . . ; [and] to Controversies between two or more States; [and] between aState and Citizens of another State." U. S. Const., Art. III,$ 2. The Constitution contains no analogous grant of authority to Congress. Moreover, the Supremacy Clause makesfederal law paramount over the contrary positions of stateofficials; the power of federal courts to enforce federal lawthus presupposes some authority to order state officials tocomply. See Puerto Rico v. Branstad, supra, at 227-228(overruling Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66 (1861)).In sum, the cases relied upon by the United States holdonly that federal law is enforceable in state courts and thatfederal courts may in proper circumstances order state officials to comply with federal law, propositions that by nomeans imply any authority on the part of Congress to mandate state regulation.Third, the United States, supported by the three sited regional compacts as amici, argues that the Constitution envisions a role for Congress as an arbiter of interstate disputes.The United States observes that federal courts, and thisCourt in particular, have frequently resolved conflicts amongStates. See, e. g., Arkansas v. Oklahoma, 503 U. S. 91505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT180 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court(1992); Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U. S. 437 (1992). Manyof these disputes have involved the allocation of shared resources among the States, a category perhaps broad enoughto encompass the allocation of scarce disposal space for radioactive waste. See, e. g., Colorado v. New Mexico, 459 U. S.176 (1982);Arizona v. California, 373 U. S. 546 (1963). TheUnited States suggests that if the Court may resolve suchinterstate disputes, Congress can surely do the same underthe Commerce Clause. The regional compacts support thisargument with a series of quotations from The Federalistand other contemporaneous documents, which the compactscontend demonstrate that the Framers established a strongNational Legislature for the purpose of resolving trade disputes among the States. Brief for Rocky Mountain Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact et al. asAmici Curiae 17,and n. 16.While the Framers no doubt endowed Congress with thepower to regulate interstate commerce in order to avoid further instances of the interstate trade disputes that werecommon under the Articles of Confederation, the Framersdid not intend that Congress should exercise that powerthrough the mechanism of mandating state regulation. TheConstitution established Congress as "a superintending au-thority over the reciprocal trade" among the States, TheFederalist No. 42, p. 268 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961), by empower-ing Congress to regulate that trade directly, not by authorizing Congress to issue trade-related orders to state govern-ments. As Madison and Hamilton explained, "a sovereigntyover sovereigns, a government over governments, a legisla-tion for communities, as contradistinguished from individuals, as it is a solecism in theory, so in practice it is subversiveof the order and ends of civil polity." Id., No. 20, at 138.BThe sited state respondents focus their attention on theprocess by which the Act was formulated. They correctly505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT181Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of the Courtobserve that public officials representing the State of NewYork lent their support to the Act's enactment. A DeputyCommissioner of the State's Energy Office testified in favorof the Act. See Low-Level Waste Legislation: Hearings onH. R. 862, H. R. 1046, H. R. 1083, and H. R. 1267 before theSubcommittee on Energy and the Environment of the HouseCommittee on Interior and Insular Affairs, 99th Cong., 1stSess., 97-98, 190-199 (1985) (testimony of Charles Guinn).Senator Moynihan of New York spoke in support of the Acton the floor of the Senate. 131 Cong. Rec. 38423 (1985).Respondents note that the Act embodies a bargain amongthe sited and unsited States, a compromise to which NewYork was a willing participant and from which New Yorkhas reaped much benefit. Respondents then pose what appears at first to be a troubling question: How can a federalstatute be found an unconstitutional infringement of statesovereignty when state officials consented to the statute'senactment?The answer follows from an understanding of the fundamental purpose served by our Government's federal structure. The Constitution does not protect the sovereignty ofStates for the benefit of the States or state governments asabstract political entities, or even for the benefit of the publicofficials governing the States. To the contrary, the Constitution divides authority between federal and state governments for the protection of individuals. State sovereigntyis not just an end in itself: "Rather, federalism secures tocitizens the liberties that derive from the diffusion of sovereign power." Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 759(1991) (Blackmun, J., dissenting). "Just as the separationand independence of the coordinate branches of the FederalGovernment serve to prevent the accumulation of excessivepower in any one branch, a healthy balance of power betweenthe States and the Federal Government will reduce the riskof tyranny and abuse from either front." Gregory v. Ash505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT182 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtcroft, 501 U. S., at 458. See The Federalist No. 51, p. 323(C. Rossiter ed. 1961).Where Congress exceeds its authority relative to theStates, therefore, the departure from the constitutional plancannot be ratified by the "consent" of state officials. Ananalogy to the separation of powers among the branches ofthe Federal Government clarifies this point. The Constitution's division of power among the three branches is violatedwhere one branch invades the territory of another, whetheror not the encroached-upon branch approves the encroach-ment. InBuckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 118-137 (1976), forinstance, the Court held that Congress had infringed thePresident's appointment power, despite the fact that thePresident himself had manifested his consent to the statutethat caused the infringement by signing it into law. See National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S., at 842, n. 12. InINS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 944-959 (1983), we held thatthe legislative veto violated the constitutional requirementthat legislation be presented to the President, despite Presidents' approval of hundreds of statutes containing a legislative veto provision. See id., at 944-945. The constitutionalauthority of Congress cannot be expanded by the "consent"of the governmental unit whose domain is thereby narrowed,whether that unit is the Executive Branch or the States.State officials thus cannot consent to the enlargement ofthe powers of Congress beyond those enumerated in theConstitution. Indeed, the facts of these cases raise the possibility that powerful incentives might lead both federal andstate officials to view departures from the federal structureto be in their personal interests. Most citizens recognizethe need for radioactive waste disposal sites, but few wantsites near their homes. As a result, while it would be wellwithin the authority of either federal or state officials tochoose where the disposal sites will be, it is likely to be inthe political interest of each individual official to avoid beingheld accountable to the voters for the choice of location. If505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT183Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of the Courta federal official is faced with the alternatives of choosing alocation or directing the States to do it, the official may wellprefer the latter, as a means of shifting responsibility for theeventual decision. If a state official is faced with the sameset of alternatives--choosing a location or having Congressdirect the choice of a location--the state official may alsoprefer the latter, as it may permit the avoidance of personalresponsibility. The interests of public officials thus may notcoincide with the Constitution's intergovernmental allocationof authority. Where state officials purport to submit to thedirection of Congress in this manner, federalism is hardlybeing advanced.Nor does the State's prior support for the Act estop it fromasserting the Act's unconstitutionality. While New Yorkhas received the benefit of the Act in the form of a few moreyears of access to disposal sites in other States, New Yorkhas never joined a regional radioactive waste compact. Anyestoppel implications that might flow from membership in acompact, see West Virginia ex rel. Dyer v. Sims, 341 U. S.22, 35-36 (1951) (Jackson, J., concurring), thus do not concernus here. The fact that the Act, like much federal legislation,embodies a compromise among the States does not elevatethe Act (or the antecedent discussions among representa-tives of the States) to the status of an interstate agreementrequiring Congress' approval under the Compact Clause.Cf.Holmes v. Jennison, 14 Pet. 540, 572 (1840) (pluralityopinion). That a party collaborated with others in seekinglegislation has never been understood to estop the partyfrom challenging that legislation in subsequent litigation.VPetitioners also contend that the Act is inconsistent withthe Constitution's Guarantee Clause, which directs theUnited States to "guarantee to every State in this Union aRepublican Form of Government." U. S. Const., Art. IV, $ 4.Because we have found the take title provision of the Act505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT184 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtirreconcilable with the powers delegated to Congress by theConstitution and hence with the Tenth Amendment's reservation to the States of those powers not delegated to theFederal Government, we need only address the applicabilityof the Guarantee Clause to the Act's other two challengedprovisions.We approach the issue with some trepidation, because theGuarantee Clause has been an infrequent basis for litigationthroughout our history. In most of the cases in which theCourt has been asked to apply the Clause, the Court hasfound the claims presented to be nonjusticiable under the"political question" doctrine. See, e. g., City of Rome v.United States, 446 U. S. 156, 182, n. 17 (1980) (challenge tothe preclearance requirements of the Voting Rights Act);Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 218-229 (1962) (challenge toapportionment of state legislative districts); Pacific StatesTelephone & Telegraph Co. v. Oregon, 223 U. S. 118, 140-151(1912) (challenge to initiative and referendum provisions ofstate constitution).The view that the Guarantee Clause implicates only nonjusticiable political questions has its origin in Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1 (1849), in which the Court was asked to decide,in the wake of Dorr's Rebellion, which of two rival governments was the legitimate government of Rhode Island. TheCourt held that "it rests with Congress," not the judiciary,"to decide what government is the established one in aState." Id., at 42. Over the following century, this limitedholding metamorphosed into the sweeping assertion that"[v]iolation of the great guaranty of a republican form of government in States cannot be challenged in the courts." Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549, 556 (1946) (plurality opinion).This view has not always been accepted. In a group ofcases decided before the holding of Luther was elevated intoa general rule of nonjusticiability, the Court addressed themerits of claims founded on the Guarantee Clause withoutany suggestion that the claims were not justiciable. See At505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT185Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of the Courttorney General of Michigan ex rel. Kies v. Lowrey, 199 U. S.233, 239 (1905);Forsyth v. Hammond, 166 U. S. 506, 519(1897); In re Duncan, 139 U. S. 449, 461-462 (1891); Minor v.Happersett, 21 Wall. 162, 175-176 (1875). See also Plessy v.Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, 563-564 (1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting) (racial segregation "inconsistent with the guaranteegiven by the Constitution to each State of a republican formof government").More recently, the Court has suggested that perhaps notall claims under the Guarantee Clause present nonjusticiablepolitical questions. SeeReynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 582(1964) ("[S]ome questions raised under the Guarantee Clauseare nonjusticiable"). Contemporary commentators have likewise suggested that courts should address the merits of suchclaims, at least in some circumstances. See, e. g., L. Tribe,American Constitutional Law 398 (2d ed. 1988); J. Ely,Democracy and Distrust: A Theory of Judicial Review 118,n., and 122-123 (1980); W. Wiecek, The Guarantee Clause ofthe U. S. Constitution 287-289, 300 (1972); Merritt, 88 Colum.L. Rev., at 70-78; Bonfield, The Guarantee Clause of ArticleIV, Section 4: A Study in Constitutional Desuetude, 46 Minn.L. Rev. 513, 560-565 (1962).We need not resolve this difficult question today. Even ifwe assume that petitioners' claim is justiciable, neither themonetary incentives provided by the Act nor the possibilitythat a State's waste producers may find themselves excludedfrom the disposal sites of another State can reasonably besaid to deny any State a republican form of government. Aswe have seen, these two incentives represent permissibleconditional exercises of Congress' authority under theSpending and Commerce Clauses respectively, in forms thathave now grown commonplace. Under each, Congress offers the States a legitimate choice rather than issuing anunavoidable command. The States thereby retain the ability to set their legislative agendas; state government officialsremain accountable to the local electorate. The twin threats505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT186 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtimposed by the first two challenged provisions of the Act--that New York may miss out on a share of federal spending orthat those generating radioactive waste within New York maylose out-of-state disposal outlets--do not pose any realisticrisk of altering the form or the method of functioning ofNew York's government. Thus even indulging the assumption that the Guarantee Clause provides a basis upon whicha State or its subdivisions may sue to enjoin the enforcementof a federal statute, petitioners have not made out such aclaim in these cases.VIHaving determined that the take title provision exceedsthe powers of Congress, we must consider whether it is severable from the rest of the Act."The standard for determining the severability of an unconstitutional provision is well established: Unless it is evi-dent that the Legislature would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power, independently of thatwhich is not, the invalid part may be dropped if what is leftis fully operative as a law." Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock,480 U. S. 678, 684 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted).While the Act itself contains no statement of whether itsprovisions are severable, "[i]n the absence of a severabilityclause, . . . Congress' silence is just that--silence--and doesnot raise a presumption against severability." Id., at 686.Common sense suggests that where Congress has enacted astatutory scheme for an obvious purpose, and where Congress has included a series of provisions operating as incen-tives to achieve that purpose, the invalidation of one of theincentives should not ordinarily cause Congress' overall in-tent to be frustrated. As the Court has observed, "it is notto be presumed that the legislature was legislating for themere sake of imposing penalties, but the penalties . . . weresimply in aid of the main purpose of the statute. They mayfail, and still the great body of the statute have operativeforce, and the force contemplated by the legislature in its505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT187Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of the Courtenactment." Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 154U. S. 362, 396 (1894). See also United States v. Jackson, 390U. S. 570, 585-586 (1968).It is apparent in light of these principles that the take titleprovision may be severed without doing violence to the restof the Act. The Act is still operative and it still serves Congress' objective of encouraging the States to attain local orregional self-sufficiency in the disposal of low level radioactive waste. It still includes two incentives that coax theStates along this road. A State whose radioactive wastegenerators are unable to gain access to disposal sites in otherStates may encounter considerable internal pressure to provide for the disposal of waste, even without the prospect oftaking title. The sited regional compacts need not acceptNew York's waste after the 7-year transition period expires,so any burden caused by New York's failure to secure a disposal site will not be borne by the residents of other States.The purpose of the Act is not defeated by the invalidation ofthe take title provision, so we may leave the remainder ofthe Act in force.VIISome truths are so basic that, like the air around us, theyare easily overlooked. Much of the Constitution is concerned with setting forth the form of our government, andthe courts have traditionally invalidated measures deviatingfrom that form. The result may appear "formalistic" in agiven case to partisans of the measure at issue, because suchmeasures are typically the product of the era's perceived necessity. But the Constitution protects us from our own bestintentions: It divides power among sovereigns and amongbranches of government precisely so that we may resist thetemptation to concentrate power in one location as an expedient solution to the crisis of the day. The shortage ofdisposal sites for radioactive waste is a pressing nationalproblem, but a judiciary that licensed extraconstitutional505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT188 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of White, J.government with each issue of comparable gravity would, inthe long run, be far worse.States are not mere political subdivisions of the UnitedStates. State governments are neither regional offices noradministrative agencies of the Federal Government. Thepositions occupied by state officials appear nowhere on theFederal Government's most detailed organizational chart.The Constitution instead "leaves to the several States a re-siduary and inviolable sovereignty," The Federalist No. 39,p. 245 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961), reserved explicitly to the Statesby the Tenth Amendment.Whatever the outer limits of that sovereignty may be, onething is clear: The Federal Government may not compel theStates to enact or administer a federal regulatory program.The Constitution permits both the Federal Government andthe States to enact legislation regarding the disposal of lowlevel radioactive waste. The Constitution enables the Federal Government to pre-empt state regulation contrary tofederal interests, and it permits the Federal Government tohold out incentives to the States as a means of encouragingthem to adopt suggested regulatory schemes. It does not,however, authorize Congress simply to direct the States toprovide for the disposal of the radioactive waste generatedwithin their borders. While there may be many constitutional methods of achieving regional self-sufficiency in radioactive waste disposal, the method Congress has chosen isnot one of them. The judgment of the Court of Appealsis accordinglyAffirmed in part and reversed in part.Justice White, with whom Justice Blackmun and Justice Stevens join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.The Court today affirms the constitutionality of two facetsof the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Actof 1985 (1985 Act), Pub. L. 99-240, 99 Stat. 1842, 42 U. S. C.$ 2021b et seq. These provisions include the monetary in505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT189Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of White, J.centives from surcharges collected by States with low-levelradioactive waste storage sites and rebated by the Secretary of Energy to States in compliance with the 1985 Act'sdeadlines for achieving regional or in-state disposal, see$$ 2021e(d)(2)(A) and 2021e(d)(2)(B)(iv), and the "access in-centives," which deny access to disposal sites for States thatfail to meet certain deadlines for low-level radioactive wastedisposal management, $ 2021e(e)(2). The Court strikesdown and severs a third component of the 1985 Act, the "taketitle" provision, which requires a noncomplying State to taketitle to or to assume liability for its low-level radioactivewaste if it fails to provide for the disposal of such wasteby January 1, 1996. $ 2021e(d)(2)(C). The Court deems thislast provision unconstitutional under principles of federalism. Because I believe the Court has mischaracterized theessential inquiry, misanalyzed the inquiry it has chosen toundertake, and undervalued the effect the seriousness of thispublic policy problem should have on the constitutionality ofthe take title provision, I can only join Parts III-A andIII-B, and I respectfully dissent from the rest of its opinionand the judgment reversing in part the judgment of theCourt of Appeals.IMy disagreement with the Court's analysis begins at thebasic descriptive level of how the legislation at issue in thesecases came to be enacted. The Court goes some way towardsetting out the bare facts, but its omissions cast the statutorycontext of the take title provision in the wrong light. Toread the Court's version of events, see ante, at 150-151, onewould think that Congress was the sole proponent of a solu-tion to the Nation's low-level radioactive waste problem.Not so. The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of1980 (1980 Act), Pub. L. 96-573, 94 Stat. 3347, and its amendatory 1985 Act, resulted from the efforts of state leaders toachieve a state-based set of remedies to the waste problem.They sought not federal pre-emption or intervention, but505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT190 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of White, J.rather congressional sanction of interstate compromises theyhad reached.The two signal events in 1979 that precipitated move-ment toward legislation were the temporary closing of theNevada disposal site in July 1979, after several serioustransportation-related incidents, and the temporary shuttingof the Washington disposal site because of similar transportation and packaging problems in October 1979. At thattime the facility in Barnwell, South Carolina, received approximately three-quarters of the Nation's low-level radioac-tive waste, and the Governor ordered a 50 percent reductionin the amount his State's plant would accept for disposal.National Governors' Association Task Force on Low-LevelRadioactive Waste Disposal, Low-Level Waste: A Programfor Action 3 (Nov. 1980) (lodged with the Clerk of this Court)(hereinaf ter A Program for Action). The Governor ofWashington threatened to shut down the Hanford, Washington, facility entirely by 1982 unless "some meaningful progress occurs toward" development of regional solutions to thewaste disposal problem. Id., at 4, n. Only three sites existed in the country for the disposal of low-level radioactivewaste, and the "sited" States confronted the undesirable alternatives either of continuing to be the dumping groundsfor the entire Nation's low-level waste or of eliminating orreducing in a constitutional manner the amount of wasteaccepted for disposal.The imminence of a crisis in low-level radioactive wastemanagement cannot be overstated. In December 1979, theNational Governors' Association convened an eight-membertask force to coordinate policy proposals on behalf of theStates. See Status of Interstate Compacts for the Disposalof Low-Level Radioactive Waste: Hearing before the SenateCommittee on the Judiciary, 98th Cong., 1st Sess., 8 (1983).In May 1980, the State Planning Council on RadioactiveWaste Management submitted the following unanimous recommendation to President Carter:505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT191Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of White, J."The national policy of the United States on low-levelradioactive waste shall be that every State is responsible for the disposal of the low-level radioactive wastegenerated by nondefense related activities within itsboundaries and that States are authorized to enter intointerstate compacts, as necessary, for the purpose ofcarrying out this responsibility." 126 Cong. Rec. 20135(1980).This recommendation was adopted by the National Gover-nors' Association a few months later. See A Program forAction 6-7; H. R. Rep. No. 99-314, pt. 2, p. 18 (1985). TheGovernors recognized that the Federal Government could assert its preeminence in achieving a solution to this problem,but requested instead that Congress oversee state-developedregional solutions. Accordingly, the Governors' Task Forceurged that "each state should accept primary responsibilityfor the safe disposal of low-level radioactive waste generatedwithin its borders" and that "the states should pursue a re-gional approach to the low-level waste disposal problem."A Program for Action 6.The Governors went further, however, in recommendingthat "Congress should authorize the states to enter into interstate compacts to establish regional disposal sites" andthat "[s]uch authorization should include the power to exclude waste generated outside the region from the regionaldisposal site."Id., at 7. The Governors had an obvious incentive in urging Congress not to add more coercive meas-ures to the legislation should the States fail to comply, butthey nevertheless anticipated that Congress might eventually have to take stronger steps to ensure compliance withlong-range planning deadlines for low-level radioactive wastemanagement. Accordingly, the Governors' Task Force"recommend[ed] that Congress defer consideration ofsanctions to compel the establishment of new disposalsites until at least two years after the enactment of com505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT192 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of White, J.pact consent legislation. States are already confrontingthe diminishing capacity of present sites and an unequivocal political warning from those states' Governors. Ifat the end of the two-year period states have not responded effectively, or if problems still exist, strongerfederal action may be necessary. But until that time,Congress should confine its role to removing obstaclesand allow the states a reasonable chance to solve theproblem themselves." Id., at 8-9.Such concerns would have been mooted had Congress en-acted a "federal" solution, which the Senate considered inJuly 1980. See S. 2189, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. (1980); S. Rep.No. 96-548 (1980) (detailing legislation calling for federalstudy, oversight, and management of radioactive waste).This "federal" solution, however, was opposed by one of thesited State's Senators, who introduced an amendment toadopt and implement the recommendations of the State Planning Council on Radioactive Waste Management. See 126Cong. Rec. 20136 (1980) (statement of Sen. Thurmond). The"state-based" solution carried the day, and as enacted, the1980 Act announced the "policy of the Federal Governmentthat . . . each State is responsible for providing for the avail-ability of capacity either within or outside the State for thedisposal of low-level radioactive waste generated within itsborders." Pub. L. 96-573, $ 4(a)(1), 94 Stat. 3348. The 1980Act further authorized States to "enter into such compactsas may be necessary to provide for the establishment andoperation of regional disposal facilities for low-level radioac-tive waste," $ 4(a)(2)(A), compacts to which Congress wouldhave to give its consent. $ 4(a)(2)(B). The 1980 Act alsoprovided that, beginning on January 1, 1986, an approvedcompact could reserve access to its disposal facilities forthose States which had joined that particular regional compact. Ibid.As well described by one of theamici, the attempts byStates to enter into compacts and to gain congressional ap505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT193Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of White, J.proval sparked a new round of political squabbling betweenelected officials from unsited States, who generally opposedratification of the compacts that were being formed, andtheir counterparts from the sited States, who insisted thatthe promises made in the 1980 Act be honored. See Brieffor American Federation of Labor and Congress of IndustrialOrganizations as Amicus Curiae 12-14. In its effort tokeep the States at the forefront of the policy amendmentprocess, the National Governors' Association organized morethan a dozen meetings to achieve a state consensus. See H.Brown, The Low-Level Waste Handbook: A User's Guide tothe Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Actof 1985, p. iv (Nov. 1986) (describing "the states' desire toinfluence any revisions of the 1980 Act").These discussions were not merely academic. The sitedStates grew increasingly and justifiably frustrated by theseeming inaction of unsited States in meeting the projectedactions called for in the 1980 Act. Thus, as the end of 1985approached, the sited States viewed the January 1, 1986,deadline established in the 1980 Act as a "drop-dead" date,on which the regional compacts could begin excluding theentry of out-of-region waste. See 131 Cong. Rec. 35203(1985). Since by this time the three disposal facilities operating in 1980 were still the only such plants accepting lowlevel radioactive waste, the unsited States perceived a veryserious danger if the three existing facilities actually carriedout their threat to restrict access to the waste generatedsolely within their respective compact regions.A movement thus arose to achieve a compromise betweenthe sited and the unsited States, in which the sited Statesagreed to continue accepting waste in exchange for the imposition of stronger measures to guarantee compliance withthe unsited States' assurances that they would develop alternative disposal facilities. As Representative Derrickexplained, the compromise 1985 legislation "gives nonsited505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT194 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of White, J.States more time to develop disposal sites, but also estab-lishes a very firm timetable and sanctions for failure to liveup [to] the agreement." Id., at 35207. Representative Mar-key added that "[t]his compromise became the basis for ouramendments to the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Actof 1980. In the process of drafting such amendments, various concessions have been made by all sides in an effort toarrive at a bill which all parties could accept."Id., at 35205.The bill that in large measure became the 1985 Act "represent[ed] the diligent negotiating undertaken by" the Na-tional Governors' Association and "embodied" the "fundamentals of their settlement." Id., at 35204 (statement ofRep. Udall). In sum, the 1985 Act was very much the product of cooperative federalism, in which the States bargainedamong themselves to achieve compromises for Congress tosanction.There is no need to resummarize the essentials of the 1985legislation, which the Court does ante, at 151-154. It does,however, seem critical to emphasize what is accurately described in one amicus brief as the assumption by Congressof "the role of arbiter of disputes among the several States."Brief for Rocky Mountain Low-Level Radioactive WasteCompact et al. as Amici Curiae 9. Unlike legislation thatdirects action from the Federal Government to the States,the 1980 and 1985 Acts reflected hard-fought agreementsamong States as refereed by Congress. The distinction iskey, and the Court's failure properly to characterize this leg-islation ultimately affects its analysis of the take title provision's constitutionality. IITo justify its holding that the take title provision contra-venes the Constitution, the Court posits that "[i]n this provision, Congress has crossed the line distinguishing encourage-ment from coercion."Ante, at 175. Without attempting tounderstand properly the take title provision's place in the505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT195Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of White, J.interstate bargaining process, the Court isolates the measureanalytically and proceeds to dissect it in a syllogistic fashion.The Court candidly begins with an argument respondents donot make: that "the Constitution would not permit Congresssimply to transfer radioactive waste from generators to stategovernments." Ibid. "Such a forced transfer," it continues, "standing alone, would in principle be no different thana congressionally compelled subsidy from state governmentsto radioactive waste producers." Ibid. Since this is not anargument respondents make, one naturally wonders why theCourt builds its analysis that the take title provision is unconstitutional around this opening premise. But havingcarefully built its straw man, the Court proceeds impressively to knock him down. "As we have seen," the Courtteaches, "the Constitution does not empower Congress tosubject state governments to this type of instruction."Ante, at 176.Curiously absent from the Court's analysis is any effort toplace the take title provision within the overall context ofthe legislation. As the discussion in Part I of this opinionsuggests, the 1980 and 1985 statutes were enacted against abackdrop of national concern over the availability of additional low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities. Congress could have pre-empted the field by directly regulatingthe disposal of this waste pursuant to its powers under theCommerce and Spending Clauses, but instead it unanimously assented to the States' request for congressional ratification of agreements to which they had acceded. See 131Cong. Rec. 35252 (1985); id., at 38425. As the floor statements of Members of Congress reveal, see supra, at 193-194,the States wished to take the lead in achieving a solution tothis problem and agreed among themselves to the variousincentives and penalties implemented by Congress to ensure505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT196 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of White, J.adherence to the various deadlines and goals.1 The chiefexecutives of the States proposed this approach, and I amunmoved by the Court's vehemence in taking away Con-gress' authority to sanction a recalcitrant unsited State nowthat New York has reaped the benefits of the sited States'concessions.AIn my view, New York's actions subsequent to enactmentof the 1980 and 1985 Acts fairly indicate its approval of theinterstate agreement process embodied in those laws withinthe meaning of Art. I, $ 10, cl. 3, of the Constitution, whichprovides that "[n]o State shall, without the Consent ofCongress, . . . enter into any Agreement or Compact withanother State." First, the States--including New York--worked through their Governors to petition Congress for the1980 and 1985 Acts. As I have attempted to demonstrate,these statutes are best understood as the products of collective state action, rather than as impositions placed on Statesby the Federal Government. Second, New York acted incompliance with the requisites of both statutes in key re-spects, thus signifying its assent to the agreement achievedamong the States as codified in these laws. After enact-ment of the 1980 Act and pursuant to its provision in $ 4(a)(2),94 Stat. 3348, New York entered into compact negotiationswith several other northeastern States before withdrawingfrom them to "go it alone." Indeed, in 1985, as the January1, 1986, deadline crisis approached and Congress consideredthe 1985 legislation that is the subject of this lawsuit, theDeputy Commissioner for Policy and Planning of the New1 As Senator McClure pointed out: "[T]he actions taken in the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources met the objections and the objectives of the States point by point; and I want to underscore what theSenator from Louisiana has indicated--that it is important that we havereal milestones. It is important to note that the discussions betweenstaffs and principals have produced a[n] agreement that does have somereal teeth in it at some points." 131 Cong. Rec. 38415 (1985).505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT197Cite as: 505 U.

New York State has been participating withthe National Governors' Association and the other largestates and compact commissions in an effort to furtherrefine the recommended approach in HR 1083 and reach aconsensus between all groups." See Low-Level Waste Leg-islation: Hearings on H. R. 862, H. R. 1046, H. R. 1083, andH. R. 1267 before the Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, 99th Cong., 1st Sess., 197 (1985) (testimony ofCharles Guinn) (emphasis added).Based on the assumption that "other states will [not] continue indefinitely to provide access to facilities adequate forthe permanent disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated in New York," 1986 N. Y. Laws, ch. 673, $ 2, the statelegislature enacted a law providing for a waste disposal facility to be sited in the State. Ibid. This measure comportedwith the 1985 Act's proviso that States which did not joina regional compact by July 1, 1986, would have to establishan in-state waste disposal facility. See 42 U. S. C. $ 2021e(e)(1)(A). New York also complied with another provisionof the 1985 Act, $ 2021e(e)(1)(B), which provided that by January 1, 1988, each compact or independent State would identify a facility location and develop a siting plan, or contractwith a sited compact for access to that region's facility. By1988, New York had identified five potential sites in Cortlandand Allegany Counties, but public opposition there causedthe State to reconsider where to locate its waste disposalfacility. See Office of Environmental Restoration and WasteManagement, U. S. Dept. of Energy, Report to Congress inResponse to Public Law 99-240: 1990 Annual Report onLow-Level Radioactive Waste Management Progress 32-35505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT198 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of White, J.(1991) (lodged with the Clerk of this Court). As it was un-dertaking these initial steps to honor the interstate compromise embodied in the 1985 Act, New York continued to takefull advantage of the import concession made by the sitedStates, by exporting its low-level radioactive waste for thefull 7-year extension period provided in the 1985 Act. Bygaining these benefits and complying with certain of the 1985Act's deadlines, therefore, New York fairly evidenced itsacceptance of the federal-state arrangement--including thetake title provision.Although unlike the 42 States that compose the nine existing and approved regional compacts, see Brief for UnitedStates 10, n. 19, New York has never formalized its assentto the 1980 and 1985 statutes, our cases support the viewthat New York's actions signify assent to a constitutionalinterstate "agreement" for purposes of Art. I, $ 10, cl. 3. InHolmes v. Jennison, 14 Pet. 540 (1840), Chief Justice Taneystated that "[t]he word `agreement,' does not necessarily import any direct and express stipulation; nor is it necessarythat it should be in writing. If there is a verbal understanding to which both parties have assented, and upon whichboth are acting, it is an `agreement.' And the use of all ofthese terms, `treaty,' `agreement,' `compact,' show that itwas the intention of the framers of the Constitution to usethe broadest and most comprehensive terms; . . . and we shallfail to execute that evident intention, unless we give to theword `agreement' its most extended signification; and soapply it as to prohibit every agreement, written or verbal,formal or informal, positive or implied, by the mutual understanding of the parties." Id., at 572. (emphasis added). Inmy view, New York acted in a manner to signify its assentto the 1985 Act's take title provision as part of the elaboratecompromise reached among the States.The State should be estopped from asserting the unconstitutionality of a provision that seeks merely to ensure that,after deriving substantial advantages from the 1985 Act,505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT199Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of White, J.New York in fact must live up to its bargain by establishingan in-state low-level radioactive waste facility or assumingliability for its failure to act. Cf. West Virginia ex rel. Dyerv. Sims, 341 U. S. 22, 35-36 (1951), Jackson, J., concurring:"West Virginia officials induced sister States to contract withher and Congress to consent to the Compact. She now attempts to read herself out of this interstate Compact . . . .Estoppel is not often to be invoked against a government.But West Virginia assumed a contractual obligation withequals by permission of another government that is sovereign in the field. After Congress and sister States had beeninduced to alter their positions and bind themselves toterms of a covenant, West Virginia should be estopped fromrepudiating her act." (Emphasis added.)BEven were New York not to be estopped from challengingthe take title provision's constitutionality, I am convincedthat, seen as a term of an agreement entered into betweenthe several States, this measure proves to be less constitutionally odious than the Court opines. First, the practicaleffect of New York's position is that because it is unwillingto honor its obligations to provide in-state storage facilitiesfor its low-level radioactive waste, other States with suchplants must accept New York's waste, whether they wishto or not. Otherwise, the many economically and sociallybeneficial producers of such waste in the State would haveto cease their operations. The Court's refusal to force NewYork to accept responsibility for its own problem inevitablymeans that some other State's sovereignty will be impingedby it being forced, for public health reasons, to accept NewYork's low-level radioactive waste. I do not understand theprinciple of federalism to impede the National Governmentfrom acting as referee among the States to prohibit one frombullying another.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT200 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of White, J.Moreover, it is utterly reasonable that, in crafting a delicate compromise between the three overburdened Statesthat provided low-level radioactive waste disposal facilitiesand the rest of the States, Congress would have to ratifysome punitive measure as the ultimate sanction for noncompliance. The take title provision, though surely onerous,does not take effect if the generator of the waste does notrequest such action, or if the State lives up to its bargain ofproviding a waste disposal facility either within the State orin another State pursuant to a regional compact arrangement or a separate contract. See 42 U. S. C. $ 2021e(d)(2)(C).Finally, to say, as the Court does, that the incursion onstate sovereignty "cannot be ratified by the `consent' of stateofficials," ante, at 182, is flatly wrong. In a case involving acongressional ratification statute to an interstate compact,the Court upheld a provision that Tennessee and Missourihad waived their immunity from suit. Over their objection,the Court held that "[t]he States who are parties to thecompact by accepting it and acting under it assume theconditions that Congress under the Constitution attached."Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm'n, 359 U. S. 275,281-282 (1959) (emphasis added). In so holding, the Courtdetermined that a State may be found to have waived a fundamental aspect of its sovereignty--the right to be immunefrom suit--in the formation of an interstate compact evenwhen in subsequent litigation it expressly denied its waiver.I fail to understand the reasoning behind the Court's selective distinctions among the various aspects of sovereigntythat may and may not be waived and do not believe thesedistinctions will survive close analysis in future cases. Hardpublic policy choices sometimes require strong measures, andthe Court's holding, while not irremediable, essentially misunderstands that the 1985 take title provision was part of acomplex interstate agreement about which New York shouldnot now be permitted to complain.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT201Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of White, J.IIIThe Court announces that it has no occasion to revisit suchdecisions asGregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452 (1991); SouthCarolina v. Baker, 485 U. S. 505 (1988); Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985);EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226 (1983); and NationalLeague of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976); see ante, at160, because "this is not a case in which Congress has subjected a State to the same legislation applicable to privateparties."Ibid. Although this statement sends the wel-come signal that the Court does not intend to cut a wideswath through our recent Tenth Amendment precedents,it nevertheless is unpersuasive. I have several difficultieswith the Court's analysis in this respect: It builds its rulearound an insupportable and illogical distinction in the typesof alleged incursions on state sovereignty; it derives its rulefrom cases that do not support its analysis; it fails to applythe appropriate tests from the cases on which it purports tobase its rule; and it omits any discussion of the most recentand pertinent test for determining the take title provision'sconstitutionality.The Court's distinction between a federal statute's regula-tion of States and private parties for general purposes, asopposed to a regulation solely on the activities of States, isunsupported by our recent Tenth Amendment cases. In nocase has the Court rested its holding on such a distinction.Moreover, the Court makes no effort to explain why this purported distinction should affect the analysis of Congress'power under general principles of federalism and the TenthAmendment. The distinction, facilely thrown out, is notbased on any defensible theory. Certainly one would behard pressed to read the spirited exchanges between theCourt and dissenting Justices inNational League of Cities,supra, and in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan TransitAuthority, supra, as having been based on the distinctionnow drawn by the Court. An incursion on state sovereignty505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT202 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of White, J.hardly seems more constitutionally acceptable if the federalstatute that "commands" specific action also applies to private parties. The alleged diminution in state authority overits own affairs is not any less because the federal mandaterestricts the activities of private parties.Even were such a distinction to be logically sound, theCourt's "anticommandeering" principle cannot persuasivelybe read as springing from the two cases cited for the proposition, Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & ReclamationAssn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 288 (1981), and FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 761-762 (1982). The Court purports todraw support for its rule against Congress "commandeer[ing]" state legislative processes from a solitary statementin dictum in Hodel. See ante, at 161: "As an initial matter,Congress may not simply `commandee[r] the legislative processes of the States by directly compelling them to enactand enforce a federal regulatory program' " (quoting Hodel,supra, at 288). That statement was not necessary to thedecision in Hodel, which involved the question whether theTenth Amendment interfered with Congress' authority topre-empt a field of activity that could also be subject to stateregulation and not whether a federal statute could dictatecertain actions by States; the language about "commandeer[ing]" States was classic dicta. In holding that a federalstatute regulating the activities of private coal mine operators was constitutional, the Court observed that "[i]t would. . . be a radical departure from long-established precedentfor this Court to hold that the Tenth Amendment prohibitsCongress from displacing state police power laws regulatingprivate activity." 452 U. S., at 292.The Court also claims support for its rule from our decision in FERC, and quotes a passage from that case in whichwe stated that " `this Court never has sanctioned explicitlya federal command to the States to promulgate and enforcelaws and regulations.' " Ante, at 161 (quoting 456 U. S., at505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT203Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of White, J.761-762). In so reciting, the Court extracts from the rele-vant passage in a manner that subtly alters the Court'smeaning. In full, the passage reads: "While this Courtnever has sanctioned explicitly a federal command to theStates to promulgate and enforce laws and regulations, cf.EPA v. Brown, 431 U. S. 99 (1977), there are instances wherethe Court has upheld federal statutory structures that ineffect directed state decisionmakers to take or to refrainfrom taking certain actions." Ibid. (citing Fry v. UnitedStates, 421 U. S. 542 (1975) (emphasis added)).2 The phrasehighlighted by the Court merely means that we have not hadthe occasion to address whether Congress may "command"the States to enact a certain law, and as I have argued inParts I and II of this opinion, these cases do not raise thatissue. Moreover, it should go without saying that the absence of any on-point precedent from this Court has no bear-ing on the question whether Congress has properly exercisedits constitutional authority under Article I. Silence by thisCourt on a subject is not authority for anything.The Court can scarcely rest on a distinction between fed-eral laws of general applicability and those ostensibly directed solely at the activities of States, therefore, when thedecisions from which it derives the rule not only made nosuch distinction, but validated federal statutes that con-stricted state sovereignty in ways greater than or similar to2 It is true that under the majority's approach, Fry is distinguishablebecause it involved a statute generally applicable to both state governments and private parties. The law at issue in that case was the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, which imposed wage and salary limitationson private and state workers alike. In Fry, the Court upheld this statute's application to the States over a Tenth Amendment challenge. In myview, Fry perfectly captures the weakness of the majority's distinction,because the law upheld in that case involved a far more pervasive intrusion on state sovereignty--the authority of state governments to pay salaries and wages to its employees below the federal minimum--than thetake title provision at issue here.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT204 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of White, J.the take title provision at issue in these cases. As Fry,Hodel, and FERC make clear, our precedents prior to Garciaupheld provisions in federal statutes that directed States toundertake certain actions. "[I]t cannot be constitutionallydeterminative that the federal regulation is likely to movethe States to act in a given way," we stated in FERC, "oreven to `coerc[e] the States' into assuming a regulatory roleby affecting their `freedom to make decisions in areas of "integral governmental functions." ' " 456 U. S., at 766. I thusam unconvinced that either Hodel or FERC supports therule announced by the Court.And if those cases do stand for the proposition that in certain circumstances Congress may not dictate that the Statestake specific actions, it would seem appropriate to apply thetest stated in FERC for determining those circumstances.The crucial threshold inquiry in that case was whether thesubject matter was pre-emptible by Congress. See 456U. S., at 765. "If Congress can require a state administrative body to consider proposed regulations as a condition toits continued involvement in a pre-emptible field--and wehold today that it can--there is nothing unconstitutionalabout Congress' requiring certain procedural minima as thatbody goes about undertaking its tasks." Id., at 771 (emphasis added). The FERC Court went on to explain that ifCongress is legislating in a pre-emptible field--as the Courtconcedes it was doing here, see ante, at 173-174--the propertest before our decision in Garcia was to assess whether thealleged intrusions on state sovereignty "do not threaten theStates' `separate and independent existence,' Lane Countyv. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 76 (1869); Coyle v. Smith, 221 U. S. 559,580 (1911), and do not impair the ability of the States `tofunction effectively in a federal system.' Fry v. UnitedStates, 421 U. S., at 547, n. 7; National League of Cities v.Usery, 426 U. S., at 852." FERC, supra, at 765-766. On505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT205Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of White, J.neither score does the take title provision raise constitutionalproblems. It certainly does not threaten New York's independent existence nor impair its ability to function effectively in the system, all the more so since the provision wasenacted pursuant to compromises reached among state leaders and then ratified by Congress.It is clear, therefore, that even under the precedents selectively chosen by the Court, its analysis of the take title provision's constitutionality in these cases falls far short of beingpersuasive. I would also submit, in this connection, that theCourt's attempt to carve out a doctrinal distinction for statutes that purport solely to regulate state activities is especially unpersuasive after Garcia. It is true that in that casewe considered whether a federal statute of general applicability--the Fair Labor Standards Act--applied to statetransportation entities but our most recent statements haveexplained the appropriate analysis in a more general manner.Just last Term, for instance, Justice O'Connor wrote forthe Court that "[w]e are constrained in our ability to considerthe limits that the state-federal balance places on Congress'powers under the Commerce Clause. See Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985)(declining to review limitations placed on Congress' Commerce Clause powers by our federal system)." Gregory v.Ashcroft, 501 U. S., at 464. Indeed, her opinion went on tostate that "this Court in Garcia has left primarily to thepolitical process the protection of the States against intrusive exercises of Congress' Commerce Clause powers."Ibid. (emphasis added).Rather than seek guidance from FERC and Hodel, therefore, the more appropriate analysis should flow from Garcia,even if these cases do not involve a congressional law generally applicable to both States and private parties. In Garcia, we stated the proper inquiry: "[W]e are convinced that505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT206 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of White, J.the fundamental limitation that the constitutional schemeimposes on the Commerce Clause to protect the `States asStates' is one of process rather than one of result. Any substantive restraint on the exercise of Commerce Clause powers must find its justification in the procedural nature of thisbasic limitation, and it must be tailored to compensate forpossible failings in the national political process rather thanto dictate a `sacred province of state autonomy.' " 469 U. S.,at 554 (quoting EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S., at 236).Where it addresses this aspect of respondents' argument, seeante, at 180-183, the Court tacitly concedes that a failing ofthe political process cannot be shown in these cases becauseit refuses to rebut the unassailable arguments that theStates were well able to look after themselves in the legislative process that culminated in the 1985 Act's passage.Indeed, New York acknowledges that its "congressional delegation participated in the drafting and enactment of both the1980 and the 1985 Acts." Pet. for Cert. in No. 91-543, p. 7.The Court rejects this process-based argument by resortingto generalities and platitudes about the purpose of federalism being to protect individual rights.Ultimately, I suppose, the entire structure of our federalconstitutional government can be traced to an interest in establishing checks and balances to prevent the exercise of tyranny against individuals. But these fears seem extremelyfar distant to me in a situation such as this. We face a crisisof national proportions in the disposal of low-level radioactive waste, and Congress has acceded to the wishes of theStates by permitting local decisionmaking rather than imposing a solution from Washington. New York itself participated and supported passage of this legislation at both thegubernatorial and federal representative levels, and then enacted state laws specifically to comply with the deadlines andtimetables agreed upon by the States in the 1985 Act. For505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT207Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of White, J.me, the Court's civics lecture has a decidedly hollow ring ata time when action, rather than rhetoric, is needed to solvea national problem.33 With selective quotations from the era in which the Constitution wasadopted, the majority attempts to bolster its holding that the take titleprovision is tantamount to federal "commandeering" of the States. Inview of the many Tenth Amendment cases decided over the past two decades in which resort to the kind of historical analysis generated in themajority opinion was not deemed necessary, I do not read the majority'smany invocations of history to be anything other than elaborate windowdressing. Certainly nowhere does the majority announce that its rule iscompelled by an understanding of what the Framers may have thoughtabout statutes of the type at issue here. Moreover, I would observe that,while its quotations add a certain flavor to the opinion, the majority'shistorical analysis has a distinctly wooden quality. One would not knowfrom reading the majority's account, for instance, that the nature offederal-state relations changed fundamentally after the Civil War. Thatconflict produced in its wake a tremendous expansion in the scope of theFederal Government's law-making authority, so much so that the personswho helped to found the Republic would scarcely have recognized themany added roles the National Government assumed for itself. Moreover,the majority fails to mention the New Deal era, in which the Court recognized the enormous growth in Congress' power under the CommerceClause. See generally F. Frankfurter & J. Landis, The Business of theSupreme Court 56-59 (1927); H. Hyman, A More Perfect Union: The Impact of the Civil War and Reconstruction on the Constitution (1973); Corwin, The Passing of Dual Federalism, 36 Va. L. Rev. 1 (1950); Wiecek, TheReconstruction of Federal Judicial Power, 1863-1875, 13 Am. J.

J. 453 (1989). While I believe weshould not be blind to history, neither should we read it so selectively asto restrict the proper scope of Congress' powers under Article I, especiallywhen the history not mentioned by the majority fully supports a moreexpansive understanding of the legislature's authority than may have existed in the late 18th century.Given the scanty textual support for the majority's position, it would befar more sensible to defer to a coordinate branch of government in itsdecision to devise a solution to a national problem of this kind. Certainlyin other contexts, principles of federalism have not insulated States frommandates by the National Government. The Court has upheld congres505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT208 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of White, J.IVThough I disagree with the Court's conclusion that thetake title provision is unconstitutional, I do not read its opinion to preclude Congress from adopting a similar measurethrough its powers under the Spending or CommerceClauses. The Court makes clear that its objection is to thealleged "commandeer[ing]" quality of the take title provision. See ante, at 175. As its discussion of the surchargeand rebate incentives reveals, see ante, at 171-172, thespending power offers a means of enacting a take title provi-sion under the Court's standards. Congress could, in otherwords, condition the payment of funds on the State's willing-ness to take title if it has not already provided a waste disposal facility. Under the scheme upheld in these cases, forexample, moneys collected in the surcharge provision mightbe withheld or disbursed depending on a State's willingnessto take title to or otherwise accept responsibility for the lowlevel radioactive waste generated in state after the statutorydeadline for establishing its own waste disposal facility haspassed. See ibid.; South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U. S. 203, 208-209 (1987);Massachusetts v. United States, 435 U. S. 444,461 (1978).Similarly, should a State fail to establish a waste disposalfacility by the appointed deadline (under the statute as presently drafted, January 1, 1996, $ 2021e(d)(2)(C)), Congresshas the power pursuant to the Commerce Clause to regulatedirectly the producers of the waste. See ante, at 174.Thus, as I read it, Congress could amend the statute to saythat if a State fails to meet the January 1, 1996, deadline forsional statutes that impose clear directives on state officials, includingthose enacted pursuant to the Extradition Clause, see, e. g., Puerto Ricov. Branstad, 483 U. S. 219, 227-228 (1987), the post-Civil War Amendments, see, e. g., South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 319-320,334-335 (1966), as well as congressional statutes that require state courtsto hear certain actions, see, e. g., Testa v. Katt, 330 U. S. 386, 392-394(1947).505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT209Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of White, J.achieving a means of waste disposal, and has not taken titleto the waste, no low-level radioactive waste may be shippedout of the State of New York. See, e. g., Hodel, 452 U. S., at288. As the legislative history of the 1980 and 1985 Actsindicates, faced with the choice of federal pre-emptive regulation and self-regulation pursuant to interstate agreementwith congressional consent and ratification, the States decisively chose the latter. This background suggests that thethreat of federal pre-emption may suffice to induce States toaccept responsibility for failing to meet critical time dead-lines for solving their low-level radioactive waste disposalproblems, especially if that federal intervention also wouldstrip state and local authorities of any input in locatingsites for low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities. Andshould Congress amend the statute to meet the Court's objection and a State refuse to act, the National Legislaturewill have ensured at least a federal solution to the wastemanagement problem.Finally, our precedents leave open the possibility that Congress may create federal rights of action in the generatorsof low-level radioactive waste against persons acting undercolor of state law for their failure to meet certain functionsdesignated in federal-state programs. Thus, we have upheld 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 suits to enforce certain rights createdby statutes enacted pursuant to the Spending Clause, see,e. g., Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn., 496 U. S. 498 (1990);Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority,479 U. S. 418 (1987), although Congress must be cautious inspelling out the federal right clearly and distinctly, see, e. g.,Suter v. Artist M., 503 U. S. 347 (1992) (not permitting a$ 1983 suit under a Spending Clause statute when the ostensible federal right created was too vague and amorphous).In addition to compensating injured parties for the State'sfailure to act, the exposure to liability established by suchsuits also potentially serves as an inducement to compliancewith the program mandate.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:08 PAGES OPINPGT210 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of Stevens, J.VThe ultimate irony of the decision today is that in its formalistically rigid obeisance to "federalism," the Court givesCongress fewer incentives to defer to the wishes of stateofficials in achieving local solutions to local problems. Thislegislation was a classic example of Congress acting as arbiter among the States in their attempts to accept responsibility for managing a problem of grave import. The Statesurged the National Legislature not to impose from Washington a solution to the country's low-level radioactive wastemanagement problems. Instead, they sought a reasonablelevel of local and regional autonomy consistent with Art. I,$ 10, cl. 3, of the Constitution. By invalidating the measuredesigned to ensure compliance for recalcitrant States, suchas New York, the Court upsets the delicate compromiseachieved among the States and forces Congress to erect several additional formalistic hurdles to clear before achievingexactly the same objective. Because the Court's justifications for undertaking this step are unpersuasive to me, Irespectfully dissent.Justice Stevens, concurring in part and dissenting inpart.Under the Articles of Confederation, the Federal Government had the power to issue commands to the States. SeeArts. VIII, IX. Because that indirect exercise of federalpower proved ineffective, the Framers of the Constitutionempowered the Federal Government to exercise legislativeauthority directly over individuals within the States, eventhough that direct authority constituted a greater intrusionon state sovereignty. Nothing in that history suggests thatthe Federal Government may not also impose its will uponthe several States as it did under the Articles. The Constitution enhanced, rather than diminished, the power of theFederal Government.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:09 PAGES OPINPGT211Cite as: 505 U. S. 144 (1992)Opinion of Stevens, J.The notion that Congress does not have the power to issue"a simple command to state governments to implement legislation enacted by Congress," ante, at 176, is incorrect andunsound. There is no such limitation in the Constitution.The Tenth Amendment 1 surely does not impose any limit onCongress' exercise of the powers delegated to it by ArticleI.2 Nor does the structure of the constitutional order or thevalues of federalism mandate such a formal rule. To thecontrary, the Federal Government directs state governmentsin many realms. The Government regulates state-operatedrailroads, state school systems, state prisons, state elections,and a host of other state functions. Similarly, there can beno doubt that, in time of war, Congress could either draftsoldiers itself or command the States to supply their quotasof troops. I see no reason why Congress may not also com-mand the States to enforce federal water and air qualitystandards or federal standards for the disposition of low-levelradioactive wastes.The Constitution gives this Court the power to resolvecontroversies between the States. Long before Congress1 The Tenth Amendment provides: "The powers not delegated to theUnited States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, arereserved to the States respectively, or to the people."2 In United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100 (1941), we explained:"The amendment states but a truism that all is retained which has notbeen surrendered. There is nothing in the history of its adoption to suggest that it was more than declaratory of the relationship between thenational and state governments as it had been established by the Constitution before the amendment or that its purpose was other than to allayfears that the new national government might seek to exercise powers notgranted, and that the states might not be able to exercise fully their reserved powers. See e. g., II Elliot's Debates, 123, 131, III id. 450, 464,600; IV id. 140, 149; I Annals of Congress, 432, 761, 767-768; Story, Commentaries on the Constitution, $$ 1907-1908."From the beginning and for many years the amendment has been construed as not depriving the national government of authority to resort toall means for the exercise of a granted power which are appropriate andplainly adapted to the permitted end." Id., at 124; see also ante, at 155-157.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:09 PAGES OPINPGT212 NEW YORK v. UNITED STATESOpinion of Stevens, J.enacted pollution-control legislation, this Court crafted abody of " `interstate common law,' " Illinois v. City of Milwaukee, 406 U. S. 91, 106 (1972), to govern disputes betweenStates involving interstate waters. See Arkansas v. Oklahoma, 503 U. S. 91, 98-99 (1992). In such contexts, we havenot hesitated to direct States to undertake specific actions.For example, we have "impose[d] on States an affirmativeduty to take reasonable steps to conserve and augment thewater supply of an interstate stream." Colorado v. NewMexico, 459 U. S. 176, 185 (1982) (citing Wyoming v. Colo-rado, 259 U. S. 419 (1922)). Thus, we unquestionably havethe power to command an upstream State that is pollutingthe waters of a downstream State to adopt appropriate regulations to implement a federal statutory command.With respect to the problem presented by the cases at hand,if litigation should develop between States that have joineda compact, we would surely have the power to grant relief inthe form of specific enforcement of the take title provision.3Indeed, even if the statute had never been passed, if oneState's radioactive waste created a nuisance that harmed itsneighbors, it seems clear that we would have had the power3 Even if $ 2021e(d)(2)(C) is "invalidated" insofar as it applies to the Stateof New York, it remains enforceable against the 44 States that have joinedinterstate compacts approved by Congress because the compacting Stateshave, in their agreements, embraced that provision and given it independent effect. Congress' consent to the compacts was "granted subject tothe provisions of the [Act] . . . and only for so long as the [entities] established in the compact comply with all the provisions of [the] Act." Appalachian States Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact Consent Act, Pub. L.100-319, 102 Stat. 471. Thus the compacts incorporated the provisions ofthe Act, including the take title provision. These compacts, the productof voluntary interstate cooperation, unquestionably survive the "invalidation" of $ 2021e(d)(2)(C) as it applies to New York. Congress did not "direc[t]" the States to enter into these compacts and the decision of eachcompacting State to enter into a compact was not influenced by the existence of the take title provision: Whether a State went its own way orjoined a compact, it was still subject to the take title provision.505us1$u99 07-15-96 23:05:09 PAGES OPINPGT213Cite as: 505 U.

Argued January 22, 1992--Decided June 19, 1992During 1973-1978, respondent chewing gum manufacturer, which is basedin Chicago, sold its products in Wisconsin through a sales force consisting of a regional manager and various "field" representatives, all ofwhom engaged in various activities in addition to requesting ordersfrom customers. Wisconsin orders were sent to Chicago for acceptance,and were filled by shipment through common carrier from outside theState. In 1980, petitioner Wisconsin Department of Revenue concludedthat respondent's in-state business activities during the years in question had been sufficient to support imposition of a franchise tax. Respondent objected to the assessment of that tax, maintaining that it wasimmune under 15 U. S. C. $ 381(a), which prohibits a State from taxingthe income of a corporation whose only business activities within theState consist of "solicitation of orders" for tangible goods, provided thatthe orders are sent outside the State for approval and the goods aredelivered from out of state. Ultimately, the State Supreme Court disallowed the imposition of the tax.Held: Respondent's activities in Wisconsin fell outside the protection of$ 381(a). Pp. 220-235.(a) In addition to any speech or conduct that explicitly or implicitlyproposes a sale, "solicitation of orders" as used in $ 381(a) covers thoseactivities that are entirely ancillary to requests for purchases--thosethat serve no independent business function apart from their connectionto the soliciting of orders. The statutory phrase should not be interpreted narrowly to cover only actual requests for purchases or the actions that are absolutely essential to making those requests, but includesthe entire process associated with inviting an order. Thus, providing acar and a stock of free samples to salesmen is part of the "solicitation oforders," because the only reason to do it is to facilitate requests forpurchases. On the other hand, the statutory phrase should not be interpreted broadly to include all activities that are routinely, or evenclosely, associated with solicitation or customarily performed by salesmen. Those activities that the company would have reason to engagein anyway but chooses to allocate to its in-state sales force are not covered. For example, employing salesmen to repair or service the company's products is not part of the "solicitation of orders," since there is505us1100Z 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT215Cite as: 505 U. S. 214 (1992)Syllabusgood reason to get that done whether or not the company has a salesforce. Pp. 223-231.(b) There is a de minimis exception to the activities that forfeit $ 381immunity. Whether a particular activity is sufficiently de minimisto avoid loss of $ 381 immunity depends upon whether that activity establishes a nontrivial additional connection with the taxing State.Pp. 231-232.(c) Respondent's Wisconsin business activities were not limited tothose specified in $ 381. Although the regional manager's recruitment,training, and evaluation of employees and intervention in credit disputes, as well as the company's use of hotels and homes for sales-relatedmeetings, must be viewed as ancillary to requesting purchases, the salesrepresentatives' practices of replacing retailers' stale gum without cost,of occasionally using "agency stock checks" to sell gum to retailers whohad agreed to install new display racks, and of storing gum for thesepurposes at home or in rented space cannot be so viewed, since thoseactivities constituted independent business functions quite separatefrom the requesting of orders and respondent had a business purposefor engaging in them whether or not it employed a sales force. Moreover, the nonimmune activities, when considered together, are not deminimis. While their relative magnitude was not large compared torespondent's other Wisconsin operations, they constituted a nontrivialadditional connection with the State. Pp. 232-235.160 Wis. 2d 53, 465 N.

S. 214 (1992)Opinion of the Courtparts of other States, which was subdivided into severalgeographic territories.The district manager for the midwestern district had hisresidence and company office in Illinois, and visited Wisconsin only six to nine days each year, usually for a salesmeeting or to call on a particularly important account. Theregional manager of the Milwaukee region resided in Wisconsin, but Wrigley did not provide him with a company of-fice. He had general responsibility for sales activities in theregion, and would typically spend 80-to-95% of his timeworking with the sales representatives in the field or contacting certain "key" accounts. The remainder of his timewas devoted to administrative activities, including writingand reviewing company reports, recruiting new sales representatives, making recommendations to the district managerconcerning the hiring, firing, and compensation of sales representatives, and evaluating their performance. He wouldpreside at full-day sales strategy meetings for all regionalsales representatives once or twice a year. The managerfrom 1973 to 1976, John Kroyer, generally held these meetings in the "office" he maintained in the basement of hishome, whereas his successor, Gary Hecht, usually held themat a hotel or motel. (Kroyer claimed income tax deductionsfor this office, but Wrigley did not reimburse him for it,though it provided a filing cabinet.) Mr. Kroyer also intervened two or three times a year to help arrange a solutionto credit disputes between the Chicago office and importantlocal accounts. Mr. Hecht testified that he never engaged insuch activities, although Wrigley's formal position description for regional sales manager continued to list as one ofthe assigned duties "[r]epresent[ing] the company on creditproblems as necessary."The sales or "field" representatives in the Milwaukee region, each of whom was assigned his own territory, residedin Wisconsin. They were provided with company cars, butnot with offices. They were also furnished a stock of gum505us1100K 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT218 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF REVENUE v.WILLIAM WRIGLEY, JR., CO.Opinion of the Court(with an average wholesale value of about $1,000), a supply ofdisplay racks, and promotional literature. These materialswere kept at home, except that one salesman, whose apart-ment was too small, rented storage space at about $25 permonth, for which he was reimbursed by Wrigley.On a typical day, the sales representative would load upthe company car with a supply of display racks and severalcases of gum, and would visit accounts within his territory.In addition to handing out promotional materials and freesamples, and directly requesting orders of Wrigley products,he would engage in a number of other activities which Wrigley asserts were designed to promote sales of its products.He would, for example, provide free display racks to retailers(perhaps several on any given day), and would seek to havethese new racks, as well as pre-existing ones, prominentlylocated. The new racks were usually filled from the retailer's existing stock of Wrigley gum, but it would sometimeshappen--perhaps once a month--that the retailer had noWrigley products on hand and did not want to wait until theycould be ordered from the wholesaler. In that event, therack would be filled from the stock of gum in the salesman'scar. This gum, which would have a retail value of $15 to$20, was not provided without charge. The representativewould issue an "agency stock check" to the retailer, indicating the quantity supplied; he would send a copy of this tothe Chicago office or to the wholesaler, and the retailerwould ultimately be billed (by the wholesaler) in the properamount.When visiting a retail account, Wrigley's sales representative would also check the retailer's stock of gum for freshness, and would replace stale gum at no cost to the retailer.This was a regular part of a representative's duties, and atany given time up to 40% of the stock of gum in his possession would be stale gum that had been removed from retailstores. After accumulating a sufficient amount of staleproduct, the representative either would ship it back to505us1100K 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT219Cite as: 505 U.

Credit and collection activities were similarly handled by the Chicago office. Although Wrigley engaged in print, radio, and television advertising in Wisconsin,the purchase and placement of that advertising was managedby an independent advertising agency located in Chicago.Wrigley had never filed tax returns or paid taxes in Wisconsin; indeed, it was not licensed to do business in thatState. In 1980, petitioner Wisconsin Department of Revenue concluded that the company's in-state business activitiesduring the years 1973-1978 had been sufficient to supportimposition of a franchise tax, and issued a tax assessment ona percentage of the company's apportionable income forthose years. Wrigley objected to the assessment, maintaining that its Wisconsin activities were limited to "solicitationof orders" within the meaning of 15 U. S. C. $ 381, and thatit was therefore immune from Wisconsin franchise taxes.After an evidentiary hearing, the Wisconsin Tax AppealsCommission unanimously upheld the imposition of the tax.CCH Wis.

S. 807 (1991).IIIn Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minne-sota, 358 U. S. 450, 454 (1959), we considered Minnesota's imposition of a properly apportioned tax on the net income ofan Iowa cement corporation whose "activities in Minnesotaconsisted of a regular and systematic course of solicitation oforders for the sale of its products, each order being subjectto acceptance, filling and delivery by it from its plant [inIowa]." The company's salesmen, operating out of a threeroom office in Minneapolis rented by their employer, solicitedpurchases by cement dealers and by customers of cementdealers. They also received complaints about goods thathad been lost or damaged in shipment, and forwarded theseback to Iowa for further instructions. Id., at 454-455. Thecement company's contacts with Minnesota were otherwisevery limited; it had no bank account, real property, or ware-housed merchandise in the State. We nonetheless rejectedCommerce Clause and due process challenges to the tax:"We conclude that net income from the interstate opera-tions of a foreign corporation may be subjected to statetaxation provided the levy is not discriminatory and isproperly apportioned to local activities within the taxingState forming sufficient nexus to support the same."Id., at 452.The opinion in Northwestern States was handed down inFebruary 1959. Less than a week later, we granted a motion to dismiss (apparently on mootness grounds) the appealof a Louisiana Supreme Court decision that had rejected dueprocess and Commerce Clause challenges to the impositionof state net-income taxes based on local solicitation of ordersthat were sent out of state for approval and shipping.Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v.

That decision was particularly significant because,unlike the Iowa cement company in Northwestern States, theKentucky liquor company in Brown-Forman did not lease(or own) any real estate in the taxing State. Rather, itsactivities were limited to"the presence of `missionary men' who call upon wholesale dealers [in Louisiana] and who, on occasion, accompany the salesmen of these wholesalers to assist them inobtaining a suitable display of appellant's merchandiseat the business establishments of said retailers . . . ."234 La., at 653-654, 101 So. 2d, at 70.Two months later, we denied certiorari in another Louisianacase upholding the imposition of state tax on the income of anout-of-state corporation that neither leased nor owned realproperty in Louisiana and whose only activities in that State"consist[ed] of the regular and systematic solicitation of orders for its product by fifteen salesmen."

The primary sources of confusion, inthis case as in others, have been two questions: (1) what isthe scope of the crucial term "solicitation of orders"; and(2) whether there is a de minimis exception to the activity(beyond "solicitation of orders") that forfeits $ 381 immunity.We address these issues in turn.ASection 381(a)(1) confers immunity from state incometaxes on any company whose "only business activities" inthat State consist of "solicitation of orders" for interstatesales. "Solicitation," commonly understood, means "[a]sking" for, or "enticing" to, something, see Black's Law Dic-tionary 1393 (6th ed. 1990); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2169 (1981) ("solicit" means "to approachwith a request or plea (as in selling or begging)"). We thinkit evident that in this statute the term includes, not just ex-plicit verbal requests for orders, but also any speech or conduct that implicitly invites an order. Thus, for example, asalesman who extols the virtues of his company's product tothe retailer of a competitive brand is engaged in "solicita-tion" even if he does not come right out and ask the retailerto buy some. The key question in this case is whether, andto what extent, "solicitation of orders" covers activities thatneither explicitly nor implicitly propose a sale.505us1100K 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT224 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF REVENUE v.WILLIAM WRIGLEY, JR., CO.Opinion of the CourtIn seeking the answer to that question, we reject the prop-osition put forward by Wisconsin and its amici that we mustconstrue $ 381 narrowly because we said in Heublein that" `unless Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not bedeemed to have significantly changed the Federal-State bal-ance,' " 409 U. S., at 281-282 (citation omitted). That principle--which we applied in Heublein to reject a suggested in-ference from $ 381 that States cannot regulate solicitation ina manner that might cause an out-of-state company to forfeitits tax immunity--has no application in the present case. Because $ 381 unquestionably does limit the power of States totax companies whose only in-state activity is "the solicitationof orders," our task is simply to ascertain the fair meaningof that term. FMC Corp. v. Holliday, 498 U. S. 52, 57 (1990).Wisconsin views some courts as having adopted the posi-tion that an out-of-state company forfeits its $ 381 immunityif it engages in "any activity other than requesting the cus-tomer to purchase the product." Brief for Petitioner 21; seealso id., at 19, n. 8 (citing Hervey v. AMF Beaird, Inc., 250Ark. 147, 464 S. W. 2d 557 (1971);Clairol, Inc. v. Kingsley,109 N. J. Super. 22, 262 A. 2d 213, aff 'd, 57 N.

Though Clairolis frequently cited for this construction, the opinion in the case does notin fact recite it. In any event, our summary disposition affirmed only thejudgment below, and cannot be taken as adopting the reasoning of thelower court. Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.

S. 214 (1992)Opinion of the Courtwhich expands the immunity of subsection (a) when the out-of-state seller does its marketing through independent contractors, to include not only solicitation of orders for sales,but also actual sales, and in addition "the maintenance . . . ofan office . . . by one or more independent contractors whoseactivities . . . consist solely of making sales, or soliciting orders for sales . . . ." 3 The plain implication of this is thatwithout that separate indulgence the maintenance of an office for the exclusive purpose of conducting the exemptedsolicitation and sales would have provided a basis for taxation--i. e., that the phrase "solicitation of orders" does notembrace the maintenance of an office for the exclusive purpose of soliciting orders. Of course the phrase "solicitationof orders" ought to be accorded a consistent meaning withinthe section, see Sorenson v. Secretary of Treasury, 475 U. S.851, 860 (1986), and if it does not embrace maintaining anoffice for soliciting in subsection (c), it does not do so in sub-section (a) either. One might argue that the necessity ofspecial permission for an office establishes that the phrase"solicitation of orders" covers only the actual requests forpurchases or, at most, the actions absolutely essential tomaking those requests.We think, however, that would be an unreasonable readingof the text. That the statutory phrase uses the term "solicitation" in a more general sense that includes not merely theultimate act of inviting an order but the entire process associated with the invitation is suggested by the fact that $ 3813 Title 15 U. S. C. $ 381(c) reads in its entirety as follows:"For purposes of subsection (a) of this section, a person shall not beconsidered to have engaged in business activities within a State duringany taxable year merely by reason of sales in such State, or the solicitationof orders for sales in such State, of tangible personal property on behalfof such person by one or more independent contractors, or by reason ofthe maintenance, of an office in such State by one or more independentcontractors whose activities on behalf of such person in such State consistsolely of making sales, or soliciting orders for sales, or [sic] tangible personal property."505us1100K 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT226 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF REVENUE v.WILLIAM WRIGLEY, JR., CO.Opinion of the Courtdescribes "the solicitation of orders" as a subcategory, not ofin-stateacts, but rather of in-state "business activities"--aterm that more naturally connotes courses of conduct. SeeWebster's Third New International Dictionary 22 (1981) (defining "activity" as "an occupation, pursuit, or recreation inwhich a person is active--often used in pl. <business activities>"). Moreover, limiting "solicitation of orders" to actualrequests for purchases would reduce $ 381(a)(1) to a nullity.(It is obviously impossible to make a request without someaccompanying action, such as placing a phone call or drivinga car to the customer's location.) And limiting it to acts"essential" for making requests would engender endless uncertainty, contrary to the whole purpose of the statute. (Isit "essential" to use a company car, or to take a taxi, in orderto conduct in-person solicitation? For that matter, is it "essential" to solicit in person?) It seems to us evident that"solicitation of orders" embraces request-related activitythat is not even, strictly speaking, essential, or else it wouldnot cover salesmen's driving on the State's roads, spendingthe night in the State's hotels, or displaying within the Statesamples of their product. We hardly think the statute hadin mind only day-trips into the taxing jurisdiction by emptyhanded drummers on foot. See United States Tobacco Co.v. Commonwealth, 478 Pa. 125, 140, 386 A. 2d 471, 478 ("Congress could hardly have intended to exempt only walkingsolicitors"), cert. denied, 439 U. S. 880 (1978). And finally,this extremely narrow interpretation of "solicitation" wouldcause $ 381 to leave virtually unchanged the law that existedbefore its enactment. Both Brown-Forman (where thesalesman assisted wholesalers in obtaining suitable displaysfor whiskey at retail stores) and International Shoe (wherehotel rooms were used to display shoes) would be decided asthey were before, upholding the taxation.At the other extreme, Wrigley urges that we adopt a broadinterpretation of "solicitation" which it describes as havingbeen adopted by the Wisconsin Supreme Court based on that505us1100K 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT227Cite as: 505 U.

Kimberly-Clark Corp., 275Ind. 378, 384, 416 N. E. 2d 1264, 1268 (1981). According toWrigley, this would treat as "solicitation of orders" any ac-tivities that are "ordinary and necessary `business activities'accompanying the solicitation process" or are "routinelyassociated with deploying a sales force to conduct the solicitation, so long as there is no office, plant, warehouse orinventory in the State." Brief for Respondent 9, 19-20; seealso J. Hellerstein, State Taxation || 6.11[2], p. 245 (1983)("[S]olicitation ought to be held to embrace other normalincidents of activities of salesmen" or the "customary func-tions of sales representatives of out-of-state merchants").We reject this "routinely-associated-with-solicitation" or"customarily-performed-by-salesmen" approach, since it converts a standard embracing only a particular activity ("solici-tation") into a standard embracing all activities routinelyconducted by those who engage in that particular activity("salesmen"). If, moreover, the approach were to be applied(as respondent apparently intends) on an industry-by-industry basis, it would render the limitations of $ 381(a)toothless, permitting "solicitation of orders" to be whatevera particular industry wants its salesmen to do.44 The dissent explicitly agrees with our rejection of the "ordinary andnecessary" standard advocated by Wrigley. Post, at 236. It then proceeds, however, to adopt that very standard. It states that the testshould be whether a given activity is one that "reasonable buyers wouldconsider . . . to be a part of the solicitation itself and not a significant andindependent service or component of value." Post, at 237. It is obviousthat those activities that a reasonable buyer would consider "part of thesolicitation itself" rather than an "independent service" are those that arecustomarily performed in connection with solicitation. Any doubt thatthis is what the dissent intends is removed by its later elaboration of its505us1100K 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT228 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF REVENUE v.WILLIAM WRIGLEY, JR., CO.Opinion of the CourtIn any case, we do not regard respondent's proposed ap-proach to be an accurate characterization of the WisconsinSupreme Court's opinion. The Wisconsin court construed"solicitation of orders" to reach only those activities that are"closely associated" with solicitation, industry practice beingonly one factor to be considered in judging the "close[ness]"of the connection between the challenged activity and theactual requests for orders. 160 Wis. 2d, at 82, 465 N. W. 2d,at 811-812. The problem with that standard, it seems tous, is that it merely reformulates rather than answers thecrucial question. "What constitutes the `solicitation of or-ders'?" becomes "What is `closely related' to a solicitationrequest?" This fails to provide the "[c]larity that would re-move uncertainty" which we identified as the primary goalof $ 381. Heublein, 409 U. S., at 280.We proceed, therefore, to describe what we think theproper standard to be. Once it is acknowledged, as we haveconcluded it must be, that "solicitation of orders" coversmore than what is strictly essential to making requests forpurchases, the next (and perhaps the only other) clear line isthe one between those activities that are entirely ancillaryto requests for purchases--those that serve no independenttest in the context of the facts of this case. The dissent repeatedly inquires whether an activity is a "normal ac[t] of courtesy from seller tobuyer," post, at 242 (emphasis added); whether it is a "common solicitation practic[e]," post, at 244 (emphasis added); and whether Wrigley "exceed[ed] the normal scope of solicitation," post, at 242 (emphasis added).Of course, given Wrigley's significant share of the Wisconsin chewing gummarket, most activities it chooses to "conduc[t] in the course of solicitation," post, at 246, will be viewed as a normal part of the solicitation process itself. Had Wrigley's sales representatives routinely approved orderson the spot; or accepted payments on past-due accounts; or even madeoutright sales of gum, it is difficult to see how a reasonable buyer wouldhave thought that was not "part of the solicitation itself"--it certainly hasno "independent value" to him. Nothing in the text of the statute suggests that it was intended to confer tax immunity on whatever activitiesare engaged in by sales agents in a particular industry.505us1100K 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT229Cite as: 505 U.

National Tires, Inc. v. Lindley,68 Ohio App. 2d 71, 78-79, 426 N. E. 2d 793, 798 (1980) (company's activities went beyond solicitation to "functions morecommonly related to maintaining an on-going business").Providing a car and a stock of free samples to salesmen ispart of the "solicitation of orders," because the only reasonto do it is to facilitate requests for purchases. Contrariwise,employing salesmen to repair or service the company's products is not part of the "solicitation of orders," since there isgood reason to get that done whether or not the companyhas a sales force. Repair and servicing may help to increasepurchases; but it is not ancillary to requesting purchases,and cannot be converted into "solicitation" by merely beingassigned to salesmen. See, e. g., Herff Jones Co. v. StateTax Comm'n, 247 Ore. 404, 412, 430 P. 2d 998, 1001-10025 The dissent states that ancillarity should be judged, not from the perspective of the seller, but from the persective of the buyer. Post, at 237(test is whether "reasonable buyers would consider [the activities] to be apart of the solicitation itself") (emphasis added); post, at 243 ("The test Ipropose . . . requires an objective assessment from the vantage point of areasonable buyer") (emphasis added); post, at 246 (question is whether theactivities "possess independent value to the customer") (emphasis added).As explained earlier, see n. 4, supra, this rule inevitably results in awhatever-the-industry-wants standard, despite the dissent's unequivocaldisavowal of such a test.The dissent also suggests that ancillarity should be judged by askingwhether a particular challenged activity is "related to a particular salescall or to a particular sales solicitation," post, at 244 (emphasis added).This standard, besides being amorphous, cannot be correct. Those activities that are most clearly not immunized by the statute--e. g., actual sales,collection of funds--would seem to be the ones most closely "related" toparticular acts of actual solicitation. And activities the dissent finds immunized in the present case--maintenance of a storage facility and use ofa home office--are extremely remote.505us1100K 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT230 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF REVENUE v.WILLIAM WRIGLEY, JR., CO.Opinion of the Court(1967) (no $ 381 immunity for sales representatives' collec-tion activities).6As we have discussed earlier, the text of the statute (the"office" exception in subsection (c)) requires one exceptionto this principle: Even if engaged in exclusively to facilitaterequests for purchases, the maintenance of an office withinthe State, by the company or on its behalf, would go beyondthe "solicitation of orders." We would not make any moregeneralized exception to our immunity standard on the basisof the "office" provision. It seemingly represents a judgment that a company office within a State is such a signifi-cant manifestation of company "presence" that, absent a specific exemption, income taxation should always be allowed.Jantzen, Inc. v. District of Columbia, 395 A. 2d 29, 32 (D. C.1978); see generally Hellerstein, State Taxation || 6.4.Wisconsin urges us to hold that no postsale activities canbe included within the scope of covered "solicitation." Wedecline to do so. Activities that take place after a sale willordinarily not be entirely ancillary in the sense we have de-scribed, see,e. g., Miles Laboratories v. Department of Reve-nue, 274 Ore. 395, 400, 546 P. 2d 1081, 1083 (1976) (replacingdamaged goods), but we are not prepared to say that willinvariably be true. Moreover, the presale/postsale distinction is hopelessly unworkable. Even if one disregards theconfusion that may exist concerning when a sale takes place,cf. Uniform Commercial Code $ 2-401, 1A U. L. A. 675 (1989),manufacturers and distributors ordinarily have ongoing relationships that involve continuous sales, making it often im6 Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, post, at 242, 246, both BrownForman Distillers Corp. v.

Fontenot, 236 La. 279, 107 So. 2d640 (1958), would have been decided differently under these principles.The various activities at issue in those cases (renting a room for temporarydisplay of sample products; assisting wholesalers in obtaining suitableproduct display in retail shops) would be considered merely ancillaryto either wholesale solicitation or downstream (consumer or retailer)solicitation.505us1100K 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT231Cite as: 505 U. S. 214 (1992)Opinion of the Courtpossible to determine whether a particular incidental activ-ity was related to the sale that preceded it or the sale thatfollowed it. BThe Wisconsin Supreme Court also held that a companydoes not necessarily forfeit its tax immunity under $ 381 byperforming some in-state business activities that go beyond"solicitation of orders"; rather, it said, "[c]ourts should alsoanalyze" whether these additional activities were " `devia-tions from the norm' " or "de minimis activities." 160Wis. 2d, at 82, 465 N. W. 2d, at 811 (citation omitted). Wisconsin asserts that the plain language of the statute bars thisrecognition of a de minimis exception, because the immunityis limited to situations where "the only business activitieswithin [the] State" are those described, 15 U. S. C. $ 381 (emphasis added). This ignores the fact that the venerablemaximde minimis non curat lex ("the law cares not fortrifles") is part of the established background of legal principles against which all enactments are adopted, and which allenactments (absent contrary indication) are deemed to accept. See, e. g., Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504U. S. 607, 618 (1992); Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S. 1, 8-9(1992); Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651, 674 (1977); AbbottLaboratories v. Portland Retail Druggists Assn., Inc., 425U. S. 1, 18 (1976); Industrial Assn. of San Francisco v.United States, 268 U. S. 64, 84 (1925). It would be especiallyunreasonable to abandon normal application of the de minimis principle in construing $ 381, which operates in suchstark, all-or-nothing fashion: A company either has completenet-income tax immunity or it has none at all, even for itssolicitation activities. Wisconsin's reading of the statuterenders a company liable for hundreds of thousands of dollarsin taxes if one of its salesmen sells a 10-cent item in state.Finally, Wisconsin is wrong in asserting that application ofthede minimis principle "excise[s] the word `only' from thestatute."

OF REVENUE v.WILLIAM WRIGLEY, JR., CO.Opinion of the Courta strict limit upon the categories of activities that are cov-ered by $ 381, not upon their substantiality. See, e. g.,Drackett Prods. Co. v. Conrad, 370 N. W. 2d 723, 726 (N. D.1985); Kimberly Clark, 275 Ind., at 383-384, 416 N. E. 2d,at 1268.Whether a particular activity is ade minimis deviationfrom a prescribed standard must, of course, be determinedwith reference to the purpose of the standard. Section 381was designed to increase--beyond what Northwestern Statessuggested was required by the Constitution--the connectionthat a company could have with a State before subjectingitself to tax. Accordingly, whether in-state activity otherthan "solicitation of orders" is sufficientlyde minimis toavoid loss of the tax immunity conferred by $ 381 dependsupon whether that activity establishes a nontrivial additionalconnection with the taxing State.IIIWisconsin asserts that at least six activities performed byWrigley within its borders went beyond the "solicitation oforders": the replacement of stale gum by sales representa-tives; the supplying of gum through "agency stock checks";the storage of gum, racks, and promotional materials; therental of space for storage; the regional managers' recruitment, training, and evaluation of employees; and the regionalmanagers' intervention in credit disputes.7 Since none of7 Wisconsin has also argued that the scope of the regional managers'activities caused their residences to be, "[in] economic reality," Wrigleyoffices in the State. Brief for Petitioner 32. If this means that havingresident salesmen without offices can sometimes be as commercially effective as having nonresident salesmen with offices, perhaps it is true. Butit does not establish that Wrigley "maintained an office" in the sense necessary to come within the exception to the "entirely ancillary" standardwe have announced. See supra, at 230. Nor does the regional managers'occasional use of their homes for meetings with salesmen, or Kroyer'suncompensated dedication of a portion of his home basement to his ownoffice.

S. 214 (1992)Opinion of the Courtthese activities can reasonably be viewed as requests for or-ders covered by $ 381, Wrigley was subject to tax unless theywere either ancillary to requesting orders or de minimis.We conclude that the replacement of stale gum, the supplying of gum through "agency stock checks," and the storageof gum were not ancillary. As to the first: Wrigley wouldwish to attend to the replacement of spoiled product whetheror not it employed a sales force. Because that activityserves an independent business function quite separate fromrequesting orders, it does not qualify for $ 381 immunity.Miles Laboratories, 274 Ore., at 400, 546 P. 2d, at 1083. Al-though Wrigley argues that gum replacement was a "promotional necessity" designed to ensure continued sales, Brieffor Respondent 31, it is not enough that the activity facilitatesales; it must facilitate the requesting of sales, which thisdid not.8The provision of gum through "agency stock checks" presents a somewhat more complicated question. It appearsfrom the record that this activity occurred only in connectionwith the furnishing of display racks to retailers, so that itwas arguably ancillary to a form of consumer solicitation.Section 381(a)(2) shields a manufacturer's "missionary" request that an indirect customer (such as a consumer) placean order, if a successful request would ultimately result inan order's being filled by a $ 381 "customer" of the manufacmust be more formally attributed to the out-of-state company itself, or tothe agents of that company in their agency capacity--as was, for example,the rented office in Northwestern States.8 The dissent argues that this activity must be considered part of "solicitation" because, inter alia, it was "minimal," and not "significant." Post,at 243. We disagree. It was not, as the dissent suggests, a practice thatinvolved simple "acts of courtesy" that occurred only because a salesmanhappened to be on the scene and did not wish to "harm the company."Post, at 242, 244. Wrigley deliberately chose to use its sales force to engage in regular and systematic replacement of stale product on a levelthat amounted to several thousand dollars per year, which is a lot of chewing gum.505us1100K 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT234 WISCONSIN DEPT. OF REVENUE v.WILLIAM WRIGLEY, JR., CO.Opinion of the Courtturer, i. e., by the wholesaler who fills the orders of the re-tailer with goods shipped to the wholesaler from out of state.Cf. Gillette, 56 App. Div. 2d, at 482, 393 N. Y. S. 2d, at 191("Advice to retailers on the art of displaying goods to thepublic can hardly be more thoroughly solicitation . . ."). Itmight seem, therefore, that setting up gum-filled displayracks, like Wrigley's general advertising in Wisconsin, wouldbe immunized by $ 381(a)(2). What destroys this analysis,however, is the fact that Wrigley made the retailers pay forthe gum, thereby providing a business purpose for supplyingthe gum quite independent from the purpose of solicitingconsumers. Since providing the gum was not entirely ancil-lary to requesting purchases, it was not within the scope of"solicitation of orders." 9 And because the vast majority ofthe gum stored by Wrigley in Wisconsin was used in connection with stale gum swaps and agency stock checks, thatstorage (and the indirect rental of space for that storage)was in no sense ancillary to "solicitation."By contrast, Wrigley's in-state recruitment, training, andevaluation of sales representatives and its use of hotels andhomes for sales-related meetings served no purpose apartfrom their role in facilitating solicitation. The same mustbe said of the instances in which Wrigley's regional salesmanager contacted the Chicago office about "rather nasty"credit disputes involving important accounts in order to "getthe account and [Wrigley's] credit department communicat9 The dissent speculates, without any basis in the record, that Wrigleymight have chosen to charge for the gum, not for the profit, but becausegiving it away would "lower the per unit cost of all goods purchased,"which "could create either the fact or the perception that retailers werenot receiving the same price." Post, at 245. Though Wrigley's motivefor choosing to make a profit on these items seems to us irrelevant in anyevent, we cannot avoid observing how unlikely it is that this was the reason Wrigley did not include free gum in its (per-unit-cost-distorting) freeracks, although it did, as the record shows, regularly give away other(presumably per-unit-cost-distorting) free gum. Wrigley itself did nothave the temerity to make this argument.505us1100K 04-22-99 16:52:00 PAGES OPINPGT235Cite as: 505 U. S. 214 (1992)Opinion of the Courting." App. 71, 72. It hardly appears likely that this mediating function between the customer and the central officewould have been performed by some other employee--somecompany ombudsman, so to speak--if the on-location salesstaff did not exist. The purpose of the activity, in otherwords, was to ingratiate the salesman with the customer,thereby facilitating requests for purchases.Finally, Wrigley argues that the various nonimmune activities, considered singly or together, are de minimis. Inparticular, Wrigley emphasizes that the gum sales through"agency stock checks" accounted for only 0.00007% of Wrigley's annual Wisconsin sales, and in absolute terms amountedto only several hundred dollars a year. We need not decidewhether any of the nonimmune activities was de minimisin isolation; taken together, they clearly are not. Wrigley'ssales representatives exchanged stale gum, as a matter ofregular company policy, on a continuing basis, and Wrigleymaintained a stock of gum worth several thousand dollars inthe State for this purpose, as well as for the less frequentlypursued (but equally unprotected) purpose of selling gumthrough "agency stock checks." Although the relative magnitude of these activities was not large compared to Wrigley's other operations in Wisconsin, we have little difficultyconcluding that they constituted a nontrivial additional connection with the State. Because Wrigley's business activities within Wisconsin were not limited to those specified in$ 381, the prohibition on net-income taxation contained inthat provision was inapplicable.* * *Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
