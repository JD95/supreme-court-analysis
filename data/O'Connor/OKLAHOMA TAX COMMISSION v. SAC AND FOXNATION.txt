In this case, we consider whether the State of Oklahomamay impose income taxes or motor vehicle taxes on the members of the Sac and Fox Nation.IThe Sac and Fox Nation (Tribe) is a federally recognizedIndian tribe located in the State of Oklahoma. Until themid-18th century, the Tribe lived in the Great Lakes regionof the United States. M. Wright, A Guide to the IndianTribes of Oklahoma 225 (1951). In 1789, it entered into itsfirst treaty with the United States and ceded much of itsland. See Treaty at Fort Harmar, 7 Stat. 28. That wasonly the first of many agreements between the Governmentand the Tribe in which the Tribe surrendered its land andmoved elsewhere. As part of its gradual, treaty-imposedmigration, the Tribe stopped briefly along the Mississippiand Missouri Rivers in what are now the States of Illinois,Missouri, Iowa, and Nebraska.

In the mid-19th century,the Sac and Fox Nation ceded land in several States for tworeservations in Kansas, but the Government eventuallyasked it to cede these as well. Id., at 226. In 1867, the Sacand Fox Nation moved for the final time to the Sac and FoxReservation in Indian Territory.Ibid.By the 1880's, however, white settlers increasingly clamored for the land the Sac and Fox and other tribes held inIndian Territory. In response, Congress passed two statutes that greatly affected the Tribe: the General AllotmentAct (Dawes Act), 24 Stat. 388, which provided for allottingreservation land to individual tribal members and purchas-ing the surplus land for the use of white settlers; and theOklahoma Territory Organic Act, 26 Stat. 81, which estab-lished the Oklahoma Territory in what is now the westernhalf of the State of Oklahoma. This new Oklahoma Terri-tory included the Sac and Fox Nation's Reservation. InJune 1890, the Government and the Tribe concluded theirfinal treaty--a treaty designed to effectuate the provisionsof the Dawes Act. Congress ratified the treaty in 1891(hereinafter 1891 Treaty). Concerning the Tribe's cessionof land, the 1891 Treaty states:"Article I. The said the Sac and Fox Nation herebycedes, conveys, transfers, surrenders and forever relinquishes to the United States of America, all their title,claim or interest, of every kind or character, in and tothe following described tract of land or country, in theIndian Territory, to-wit: [the Reservation land grantedthe Tribe in the Treaty of 1867].. . . . ."Provided however the quarter section of land onwhich is now located the Sac and Fox Agency shall notpass to the United States by this cession, conveyance,transfer, surrender and relinquishment, but shall remainthe property of said Sac and Fox Nation, to the full ex-tent that it is now the property of said Nation--subject508us1$71J 02-14-97 19:58:20 PAGES OPINPGT118 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v.

Each of the Tribe's members,adults and minors, had the right to choose an allotment ofone quarter section (160 acres) within the boundaries of theceded land.Today, the Sac and Fox Nation has approximately 2,500members. Tr. of Oral Arg. 49. It has a fully functioningtribal government with its headquarters on the 800 acresreserved to it under the 1891 Treaty. The United Statesrecognizes and encourages the Tribe's sovereign right toself-governance within "the family of governments inthe federal constitutional system." Compact of SelfGovernance Between the Sac and Fox Nation and the UnitedStates of America 2 (June 26, 1991), see 25 U. S. C. $ 450f,note. To this end, the Tribe has a Constitution and a Codeof Laws, as well as a court system in which to enforce them.It employs approximately 140 to 150 people, most of whomare tribal members. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 50.Among the Tribe's employees are the members of the Sacand Fox Tax Commission, which administers the Sac & Foxtax code. The Tribe imposes a tribal earnings tax, seeSac & Fox Tribe of Indians of Okla. Code of Laws, Tit. 14,ch. 4, and a motor vehicle tax, see ch. 8. The earnings ofany employee employed within tribal jurisdiction, whetheror not that employee is a member of the Tribe, are subject508us1$71J 02-14-97 19:58:20 PAGES OPINPGT119Cite as: 508 U. S. 114 (1993)Opinion of the Courtto the earnings tax. Ch. 4, $ 402. The motor vehicle taxand registration provisions apply to "all motor vehiclesowned by a resident of, and principally garaged within thejurisdiction of the Sac and Fox Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma." Ch. 8, $ 802.The Oklahoma Tax Commission (Commission) also admin-isters income taxes and motor vehicle taxes and fees. Oklahoma Income Tax Act, Okla. Stat., Tit. 68, $ 2351 et seq. (1981and Supp. 1990). All residents, and nonresidents of Oklahoma who receive income in the State, are subject to theOklahoma income tax. $$ 2362, 2368. Oklahoma contendsthat the tax applies equally to members of Indian tribes andto nonmembers. Thus, it claims that those residents ofOklahoma who also reside within Sac and Fox jurisdictionare subject to both state and tribal income taxes.Pursuant to the Vehicle Excise Tax Act, Okla. Stat., Tit.68, $ 2101 et seq. (1981 and Supp. 1990), the State levies anexcise tax, calculated as a percentage of a vehicle's value,"upon the transfer of legal ownership of any vehicle registered in th[e] state and upon the use of any vehicle registeredin th[e] state." $ 2103(A). The Commission collects the tax"at the time of the issuance of a certificate of title for anysuch vehicle." Ibid. Finally, the Commission assesses avehicle registration fee for all vehicles registered with theState of Oklahoma, see Oklahoma Vehicle License and Registration Act, Okla. Stat., Tit. 47, $ 1101 et seq. (Supp. 1990), atthe annual rate of $15 plus a percentage of the value of thecar, $ 1132(A)(1). Like the vehicle excise tax, see Tit. 68,$ 2102, the vehicle registration fees are to provide funds for"general governmental functions," Tit. 47, $ 1103.The Commission contends that tribal members must register their vehicles with the State, just as everyone else wholives within Oklahoma must do. The Tribe, however, requires Sac and Fox tribal members who live and garage carswithin Sac and Fox territory to register those cars with theTribe and to use tribal license plates. Oklahoma considers508us1$71J 02-14-97 19:58:20 PAGES OPINPGT120 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. SAC AND FOX NATIONOpinion of the Courtall tribal members who register their vehicles with the Sacand Fox Nation (and hence do not pay state excise and registration taxes) to be delinquent with regard to the statetaxes. Nevertheless, so long as a tribal member retainsownership of a vehicle, the State makes no effort to collectthe allegedly delinquent taxes. If the tribal member sellsthe car to a nonmember, however, and the nonmember then"applies to the State for a title and license plate, the subsequent owner must bring up the title on the vehicle by payingthe current and delinquent excise taxes on the transfers ofthe vehicle." App. 29. The subsequent owner also mustpay registration fees for the current year and registrationfees and penalties for one previous year. Ibid. In contrast,the Commission issues transfer titles to vehicles previouslylicensed in other States upon payment of current registrationfees without more. Okla. Stat., Tit. 68, $ 2105(b) (Supp.1990).The Sac and Fox Nation brought this action on behalf ofitself and all residents of its territorial jurisdiction, App. 1,seeking a permanent injunction barring the Commissionfrom taxing the income of people who earn their incomewithin Sac and Fox territory and of people who reside withinthe Tribe's jurisdiction, id., at 8. The Tribe also sought relief from imposition of the State's vehicle excise tax and registration fees on vehicles "owned by residents of, and principally garaged within, the Sac and Fox jurisdiction" thatlawfully were registered with the Sac and Fox Nation.Ibid. In large part, the Tribe based its arguments of immunity on our opinion in McClanahan v. Arizona State TaxComm'n, 411 U. S. 164 (1973), in which we held that a Statecould not subject a tribal member living on the reservationwhose income derived from reservation sources to a stateincome tax absent express authorization from Congress.The Commission contended in response that neitherMcClanahan nor any other of our cases discussing Indian508us1$71J 02-14-97 19:58:20 PAGES OPINPGT121Cite as: 508 U. S. 114 (1993)Opinion of the Courtsovereign immunity were relevant. The analysis in thosecases, the Commission argued, applied only to tribes onestablished reservations. It reasoned that Oklahoma hadcomplete tax jurisdiction over the Sac and Fox, because the1891 Treaty had disestablished the Sac and Fox Reservation.The District Court for the Western District of Oklahomaruled on cross-motions for summary judgment. The courtdeclined to determine whether the reservation had been disestablished or its boundaries diminished. Instead, it heldthat the Commission could levy and collect state income taxon the income that nonmembers of the Tribe earned fromtribal employment on trust lands, but not on the income thattribal members earned from tribal employment on trustlands. App. to Pet. for Cert. A-10. The District Court didnot look to where the tribal members resided; it rested itsholding instead only on where they worked. The court alsoheld that the Commission could not require, as a prerequisiteto issuing an Oklahoma motor vehicle title, payment of excisetaxes and registration fees for the years a vehicle properlyhad been licensed by the Tribe. Id., at A-11 to A-13.Both parties appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed. 967 F. 2d 1425 (1992).Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals declined todetermine the boundaries of the Sac and Fox Reservation.The court read our opinion in McClanahan, supra, to standfor the proposition that, absent express congressional authorization, state jurisdiction to tax "the income of a tribalmember earned solely on a reservation is presumed to bepreempted," 967 F. 2d, at 1428, and it rejected the State'scontention that the residence of the tribal member also wasrelevant, id., at 1428, n. 3. Thus, the Court of Appealslooked only to the status of the land on which the incomewas earned--in this case, trust land. In light of OklahomaTax Comm'n v. Citizen Band of Potawatomi Tribe of Okla.,498 U. S. 505 (1991), the court concluded that for tribal immu508us1$71J 02-14-97 19:58:20 PAGES OPINPGT122 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. SAC AND FOX NATIONOpinion of the Courtnity purposes there was no difference between trust landvalidly set apart for Indian use and reservation land. 967F. 2d, at 1428. Hence, the income of tribal members whoworked for the Tribe on trust land was immune from statetaxation. Id., at 1428-1429. The income of nonmembers,however, was not immune. Id., at 1429-1430.Turning to the vehicle taxes, the Court of Appeals foundthat the excise tax was not enforced as a sales tax. Id.,at 1430. It rejected the Commission's contention that theregistration fee was imposed for the privilege of using stateroads because the State had offered no evidence to show theregistration fee was tailored to the amount of use outsideIndian country. Ibid. Relying on Moe v. ConfederatedSalish and Kootenai Tribes of Flathead Reservation, 425U. S. 463 (1976), and Washington v. Confederated Tribes ofColville Reservation, 447 U. S. 134 (1980), the court heldthat the taxes were "flatly prohibited." 967 F. 2d, at 1430.Although the taxes were imposed only indirectly on tribalmembers, the court would "not permit the State to tax indirectly what it cannot tax directly." Ibid. As with the income taxes, the Court of Appeals rejected the Tribe's argument that vehicles registered with the Tribe by nonmembersalso should be immune from state taxation. Id., at 1430-1431. Both parties petitioned for certiorari.Soon after the Court of Appeals issued its opinion, theWisconsin Supreme Court issued an opinion in which it concluded that McClanahan's presumption in favor of tax immunity was limited to those instances in which a tribal member both lived on and earned a living on the reservation.Anderson v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, 169 Wis. 2d 255,484 N. W. 2d 914 (1992). Thus, it declined to find state taximmunity for the wages of a tribal member who worked forthe tribe on the reservation but who did not live on thereservation. Id., at 274-276, 484 N. W. 2d, at 921-922.We granted the Oklahoma Tax Commission's petition forcertiorari. 506 U. S. 971 (1992).508us1$71J 02-14-97 19:58:20 PAGES OPINPGT123Cite as: 508 U. S. 114 (1993)Opinion of the CourtIIAIn McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm'n, 411 U. S.164 (1973), we held that a State was without jurisdiction tosubject a tribal member living on the reservation, and whoseincome derived from reservation sources, to a state incometax absent an express authorization from Congress. TheCommission contends that the McClanahan presumptionagainst jurisdiction comes into effect only when the incomeis earned from reservation sources by a tribal member residing on the reservation. Under the Commission's reading ofMcClanahan, the District Court erred in not determiningwhether the Sac and Fox Reservation has been disestablished or reduced because unless the members of the Sac andFox Nation live on a reservation the State has jurisdictionto tax their earnings and their vehicles. The Commissionis partially correct: The residence of a tribal member isa significant component of the McClanahan presumptionagainst state tax jurisdiction. But our cases make clear thata tribal member need not live on a formal reservation to beoutside the State's taxing jurisdiction; it is enough that themember live in "Indian country." Congress has defined Indian country broadly to include formal and informal reservations, dependent Indian communities, and Indian allotments,whether restricted or held in trust by the United States.See 18 U. S. C. $ 1151.Our decision in McClanahan relied heavily on the doctrineof tribal sovereignty. We found a "deeply rooted" policy inour Nation's history of "leaving Indians free from state jurisdiction and control." 411 U. S., at 168 (internal quotationmarks omitted). Indian nations, we noted, long have been" `distinct political communities, having territorial boundaries, within which their authority is exclusive.' " Ibid.(quoting Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 557 (1832) (Marshall, C. J.)). The Indian sovereignty doctrine, which histor508us1$71J 02-14-97 19:58:20 PAGES OPINPGT124 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. SAC AND FOX NATIONOpinion of the Courtically gave state law "no role to play" within a tribe's territo-rial boundaries, 411 U. S., at 168, did not provide "a definitiveresolution of the issues," but it did "provid[e] a backdropagainst which the applicable treaties and federal statutesmust be read," id., at 172. Accord, Colville, supra, at 178-179 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part, concurring in resultin part, and dissenting in part). Although "exemptions fromtax laws should, as a general rule, be clearly expressed,"McClanahan, 411 U. S., at 176, the tradition of Indian sovereignty requires that the rule be reversed when a State at-tempts to assert tax jurisdiction over an Indian tribe ortribal members living and working on land set aside forthose members.To determine whether a tribal member is exempt fromstate income taxes under McClanahan, a court first mustdetermine the residence of that tribal member. To the extent that the Court of Appeals ruled without such a reference, it erred. The Commission, however, contends that therelevant boundary for taxing jurisdiction is the perimeter ofa formal reservation, not merely land set aside for a tribe orits members. In the Commission's view, Indian sovereigntyserves as a "backdrop" only for those tribal members wholive on the reservation, and all others fall outside McClanahan's presumption against taxation. It is true that webegan our discussion in McClanahan by emphasizing thatwe were not "dealing with Indians who have left or neverinhabited reservations set aside for their exclusive use orwho do not possess the usual accoutrements of tribal selfgovernment." Id., at 167-168. Here, in contrast, some ofthe Tribe's members may not live within a reservation; indeed, if the Commission's interpretation of the 1891 Treatyis correct and the reservation was disestablished, none do.Nonetheless, in Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Citizen Band ofPotawatomi Tribe of Okla., we rejected precisely the sameargument--and from precisely the same litigant. There theCommission contended that even if the State did not have508us1$71J 02-14-97 19:58:20 PAGES OPINPGT125Cite as: 508 U. S. 114 (1993)Opinion of the Courtjurisdiction to tax cigarette sales to tribal members on thereservation, it had jurisdiction to tax sales by a tribal convenience store located outside the reservation on land heldin trust for the Potawatomi. 498 U. S., at 511. We notedthat we have never drawn the distinction Oklahoma urged.Instead, we ask only whether the land is Indian country.Ibid. Accord, F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law34 (1982 ed.) ("[T]he intent of Congress, as elucidated by [Su-preme Court] decisions, was to designate as Indian countryall lands set aside by whatever means for the residence oftribal Indians under federal protection, together with trustand restricted Indian allotments"); Ahboah v. Housing Authority of Kiowa Tribe of Indians, 660 P. 2d 625, 629 (Okla.1983) (same).Additional congressional enactments support our conclusion that the McClanahan presumption against state taxingauthority applies to all Indian country, and not just formalreservations. Under Pub. L. 280, 67 Stat. 588, 28 U. S. C.$ 1360 (Pub. L. 280), Congress required some States to assume, and gave other States, including Oklahoma, see Ahboah, supra, at 630, the option of assuming, criminal and civiljurisdiction "in the areas of Indian country situated withinsuch State." 25 U. S. C. $$ 1321(a), 1322(a) (emphasis added).Congress amended Pub. L. 280 with the Indian Civil RightsAct of 1968, Pub. L. 90-284, 82 Stat. 78-80, and among otherchanges, added a requirement that the tribes involved consent before a State can assume jurisdiction over Indian country. Oklahoma did not assume jurisdiction pursuant toPub. L. 280 prior to the law's amendment in 1968, see Ahboah, supra, at 630-632, and the Commission does not contend that the members of the Sac and Fox Nation have consented to an assumption of jurisdiction since the amendment.We noted in McClanahan that the "absence of either civil orcriminal jurisdiction would seem to dispose of " any contention that the State has jurisdiction to tax. 411 U. S., at178-179.508us1$71J 02-14-97 19:58:20 PAGES OPINPGT126 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. SAC AND FOX NATIONOpinion of the CourtOn remand, it must be determined whether the relevanttribal members live in Indian country--whether the land iswithin reservation boundaries, on allotted lands, or in de-pendent communities. If the tribal members do live in Indian country, our cases require the court to analyze therelevant treaties and federal statutes against the backdropof Indian sovereignty. Unless Congress expressly author-ized tax jurisdiction in Indian country, theMcClanahanpresumption counsels against finding such jurisdiction. Because all of the tribal members earning income from theTribe may live within Indian country, we need not determinewhether the Tribe's right to self-governance could operateindependently of its territorial jurisdiction to pre-empt theState's ability to tax income earned from work performedfor the Tribe itself when the employee does not reside inIndian country. See, e. g., White Mountain Apache Tribe v.Bracker, 448 U. S. 136, 142 (1980) (citing Williams v. Lee, 358U. S. 217, 220 (1959)).BThe Commission also argues that the Court of Appealserred in holding that the State could not impose state motorvehicle taxes on tribal members who live on tribal land, ga-rage their cars principally on tribal land, and register theirvehicles with the Tribe. It contends that because the vehi-cle excise tax is paid only when a vehicle is sold, it "resembles a sales tax" on transactions that occur outside Indiancountry. Brief for Petitioner 21. It also contends that theregistration fee is not pre-empted because it is imposed onall vehicles that use state roads. Id., at 23. The Court ofAppeals found that the vehicle excise tax "is not enforced asa sales tax against Sac and Fox purchasers," 967 F. 2d, at1430, and by its terms, the tax is imposed on both the trans-fer and the use of any vehicle in the State. Okla. Stat., Tit.68, $ 2103 (Supp. 1990). Furthermore, the taxes are not im-posed onall vehicles using the roads in Oklahoma. Resi-dents of nearby States pay neither the excise tax nor the508us1$71J 02-14-97 19:58:20 PAGES OPINPGT127Cite as: 508 U. S. 114 (1993)Opinion of the Courtregistration fee. See Okla. Stat., Tit. 47, $ 1125(C) (Supp.1990) (exempting "visiting nonresident[s]" from registrationand hence from payment of both taxes).We agree with the Court of Appeals that the excise taxand registration fees strongly resemble the taxes that weheld pre-empted in Washington v. Confederated Tribes ofColville Reservation, 447 U. S. 134 (1980). Prior to Colville, we held in Moe v. Confederated Salish and KootenaiTribes of Flathead Reservation, 425 U. S. 463 (1976), thatMontana could not apply its personal property tax to motorvehicles owned by tribal members who lived on the reservation. Id., at 480-481. To avoid the Moe holding, in ColvilleWashington described its motor vehicle taxes as "excisetax[es] for the `privilege' of using the covered vehicle inthe State." Colville, supra, at 162. Although Washingtoncalled its taxes "excise taxes," those taxes, like the taxes weheld pre-empted in Moe, were "assessed annually at a certainpercentage of fair market value" of the vehicle, and the Statesought to impose them "upon vehicles owned by the Tribe orits members and used both on and off the reservation." 447U. S., at 162. In Colville, we rejected Washington's distinction of Moe because the only difference between the Washington taxes and the Montana taxes was their names. 447U. S., at 163. We did "not think Moe and McClanahanc[ould] be this easily circumvented. While Washington maywell be free to levy a tax on the use outside the reservationof Indian-owned vehicles, it may not under that rubric accomplish what Moe held was prohibited." Ibid.Oklahoma's taxes are no different than those in Moe andColville. Like the taxes in both those cases, the excise taxand registration fee are imposed in addition to a sales tax;the two taxes are imposed for use both on and off Indiancountry; and the registration fees are assessed annuallybased on a percentage of the value of the vehicle. Oklahomamay not avoid our precedent by avoiding the name "personal508us1$71J 02-14-97 19:58:20 PAGES OPINPGT128 OKLAHOMA TAX COMM'N v. SAC AND FOX NATIONOpinion of the Courtproperty tax" here any more than Washington could inColville.The Commission, however, argues that Oklahoma's taxesare different for yet another reason. It claims that becausethe Sac and Fox live on scattered allotments, and not on areservation, neitherMoe nor Colville applies. That argu-ment fails for the same reasons it fails with regard to incometaxes. See supra, at 123-126. Tribal members who live inIndian country consisting solely of scattered allotmentslikely use their cars more frequently on state land and lessfrequently within Indian country than tribal members wholive on an established reservation. Nevertheless, membersof the Sac and Fox Nation undeniably use their vehicleswithin Indian country. As we said in Colville, had the State"tailored its tax to the amount of actual off-[Indian country]use, or otherwise varied something more than mere nomen-clature, this might be a different case. But it has not doneso, and we decline to treat the case as if it had." 447 U. S.,at 163-164.IIIAbsent explicit congressional direction to the contrary, wepresume against a State's having the jurisdiction to taxwithin Indian country, whether the particular territory con-sists of a formal or informal reservation, allotted lands, ordependent Indian communities. Because the Court of Ap-peals did not determine whether the tribal members onwhom Oklahoma attempts to impose its income and motorvehicle taxes live in Indian country, its judgment is vacated.We remand this case for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.
