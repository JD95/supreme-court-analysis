Roderick Jackson, a teacher in the Birmingham, Alabama,public schools, brought suit against the Birmingham Boardof Education (Board) alleging that the Board retaliatedagainst him because he had complained about sex discrimination in the high school's athletic program. Jackson claimedthat the Board's retaliation violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Pub. L. 92-318, 86 Stat. 373, asamended, 20 U. S. C. $ 1681et seq. The District Court dis-missed Jackson's complaint on the ground that Title IX doesnot prohibit retaliation, and the Court of Appeals for theEleventh Circuit affirmed. 309 F. 3d 1333 (2002). We consider here whether the private right of action implied byTitle IX encompasses claims of retaliation. We hold that itdoes where the funding recipient retaliates against an indi-vidual because he has complained about sex discrimination.IBecause Jackson's Title IX claim was dismissed under Fed-eral Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state aclaim upon which relief can be granted, "we must assumethe truth of the material facts as alleged in the complaint."Summit Health, Ltd. v. Pinhas, 500 U. S. 322, 325 (1991).According to the complaint, Jackson has been an employeeof the Birmingham school district for over 10 years. In1993, the Board hired Jackson to serve as a physical education teacher and girls' basketball coach. Jackson was trans-ferred to Ensley High School in August 1999. At Ensley, hediscovered that the girls' team was not receiving equal fund-ing and equal access to athletic equipment and facilities.The lack of adequate funding, equipment, and facilities madeit difficult for Jackson to do his job as the team's coach.In December 2000, Jackson began complaining to hissupervisors about the unequal treatment of the girls' basketball team, but to no avail. Jackson's complaints went unan-swered, and the school failed to remedy the situation. In544US1 Unit: $U33 [11-02-07 18:03:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN172 JACKSON v. BIRMINGHAM BD. OF ED.Opinion of the Courtstead, Jackson began to receive negative work evaluationsand ultimately was removed as the girls' coach in May 2001.Jackson is still employed by the Board as a teacher, but heno longer receives supplemental pay for coaching.After the Board terminated Jackson's coaching duties, hefiled suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. He alleged, among other things,that the Board violated Title IX by retaliating against himfor protesting the discrimination against the girls' basketballteam. Amended Complaint 2-3, App. 10-11. The Boardmoved to dismiss on the ground that Title IX's private causeof action does not include claims of retaliation. The DistrictCourt granted the motion to dismiss.The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.309 F. 3d 1333 (2002). It assumed, for purposes of the appeal, that the Board retaliated against Jackson for complaining about Title IX violations. It then held that Jackson'ssuit failed to state a claim because Title IX does not providea private right of action for retaliation, reasoning that"[n]othing in the text indicates any congressional concernwith retaliation that might be visited on those who complainof Title IX violations." Id., at 1344. Relying on our decision in Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U. S. 275 (2001), theCourt of Appeals also concluded that a Department of Education regulation expressly prohibiting retaliation does notcreate a private cause of action for retaliation: "Because Congress has not created a right through Title IX to redressharms resulting from retaliation, [the regulation] may not beread to create one either." 309 F. 3d, at 1346. Finally, thecourt held that, even if Title IX prohibits retaliation, Jacksonwould not be entitled to relief because he is not within theclass of persons protected by the statute.We granted certiorari, 542 U. S. 903 (2004), to resolve aconflict in the Circuits over whether Title IX's private rightof action encompasses claims of retaliation for complaintsabout sex discrimination. Compare Lowrey v.

The statute provides that "[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, beexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, orbe subjected to discrimination under any education programor activity receiving Federal financial assistance. " 20U. S. C. $ 1681(a). More than 25 years ago, in Cannon v.University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 690-693 (1979), we heldthat Title IX implies a private right of action to enforceits prohibition on intentional sex discrimination. In subsequent cases, we have defined the contours of that right ofaction. In Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools,503 U. S. 60 (1992), we held that it authorizes private partiesto seek monetary damages for intentional violations of TitleIX. We have also held that the private right of action en-compasses intentional sex discrimination in the form of arecipient's deliberate indifference to a teacher's sexual har-assment of a student,Gebser v. Lago Vista IndependentSchool Dist., 524 U. S. 274, 290-291 (1998), or to sexual harassment of a student by another student, Davis v. MonroeCounty Bd. of Ed., 526 U. S. 629, 642 (1999).In all of these cases, we relied on the text of Title IX,which, subject to a list of narrow exceptions not at issuehere, broadly prohibits a funding recipient from subjectingany person to "discrimination" "on the basis of sex." 20U. S. C. $ 1681. Retaliation against a person because thatperson has complained of sex discrimination is another formof intentional sex discrimination encompassed by Title IX'sprivate cause of action. Retaliation is, by definition, an in544US1 Unit: $U33 [11-02-07 18:03:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN174 JACKSON v. BIRMINGHAM BD. OF ED.Opinion of the Courttentional act. It is a form of "discrimination" because thecomplainant is being subjected to differential treatment.See generally Olmstead v. L. C., 527 U. S. 581, 614 (1999)(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (the "normal definition of discrimination" is "differential treatment"); see alsoNewport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462U. S. 669, 682, n. 22 (1983) (discrimination means "less favorable" treatment). Moreover, retaliation is discrimination"on the basis of sex" because it is an intentional response tothe nature of the complaint: an allegation of sex discrimina-tion. We conclude that when a funding recipient retaliatesagainst a person because he complains of sex discrimination,this constitutes intentional "discrimination" "on the basis ofsex," in violation of Title IX.The Court of Appeals' conclusion that Title IX does notprohibit retaliation because the "statute makes no mentionof retaliation," 309 F. 3d, at 1344, ignores the import of ourrepeated holdings construing "discrimination" under Title IXbroadly. Though the statute does not mention sexual harassment, we have held that sexual harassment is intentionaldiscrimination encompassed by Title IX's private right of action. Franklin, 503 U. S., at 74-75; see also id., at 75 (notingthat, under Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S.57, 64 (1986), " `when a supervisor sexually harasses a subordinate because of the subordinate's sex, that supervisor "discriminate[s]" on the basis of sex,' " and holding that "thesame rule should apply when a teacher sexually harasses . . .a student"). Thus, a recipient's deliberate indifference to ateacher's sexual harassment of a student also "violate[s] TitleIX's plain terms." Davis, supra, at 643 (citing Gebser,supra, at 290-291). Likewise, a recipient's deliberate indifference to sexual harassment of a student by another studentalso squarely constitutes "discrimination" "on the basis ofsex." Davis, 526 U. S., at 643; see also id., at 650 ("Havingpreviously determined that `sexual harassment' is `discrimination' . . . under Title IX, we are constrained to conclude544US1 Unit: $U33 [11-02-07 18:03:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN175Cite as: 544 U. S. 167 (2005)Opinion of the Courtthat student-on-student sexual harassment, if sufficientlysevere, can likewise rise to the level of discrimination actionable under the statute"). "Discrimination" is a term thatcovers a wide range of intentional unequal treatment; byusing such a broad term, Congress gave the statute a broadreach. SeeNorth Haven Bd. of Ed. v. Bell, 456 U. S. 512,521 (1982) (Courts " `must accord' " Title IX " `a sweep asbroad as its language' ").Congress certainly could have mentioned retaliation inTitle IX expressly, as it did in $ 704 of Title VII of the CivilRights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 257, as amended, 86 Stat. 109, 42U. S. C. $ 2000e-3(a) (providing that it is an "unlawful employment practice" for an employer to retaliate against anemployee because he has "opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by [Title VII], or because he hasmade a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in anymanner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under[Title VII]"). Title VII, however, is a vastly differentstatute from Title IX, see Gebser, 524 U. S., at 283-284,286-287, and the comparison the Board urges us to draw istherefore of limited use. Title IX's cause of action is implied, while Title VII's is express. See id., at 283-284.Title IX is a broadly written general prohibition on discrimination, followed by specific, narrow exceptions to that broadprohibition. See 20 U. S. C. $ 1681. By contrast, Title VIIspells out in greater detail the conduct that constitutes discrimination in violation of that statute. See 42 U. S. C.$$ 2000e-2 (giving examples of unlawful employment practices), 2000e-3 (prohibiting "[o]ther unlawful employmentpractices," including (a) "[d]iscrimination" in the form of retaliation; and (b) the discriminatory practice of "[p]rinting orpublication of notices or advertisements indicating prohibited preference . . . "). Because Congress did not list anyspecific discriminatory practices when it wrote Title IX, itsfailure to mention one such practice does not tell us anythingabout whether it intended that practice to be covered.544US1 Unit: $U33 [11-02-07 18:03:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN176 JACKSON v. BIRMINGHAM BD. OF ED.Opinion of the CourtTitle IX was enacted in 1972, three years after our deci-sion inSullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U. S. 229(1969). In Sullivan, we held that Rev. Stat. $ 1978, 42U. S. C. $ 1982, which provides that "[a]ll citizens of theUnited States shall have the same right . . . as is enjoyed bywhite citizens . . . to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, andconvey real and personal property," protected a white manwho spoke out against discrimination toward one of his ten-ants and who suffered retaliation as a result. Sullivan hadrented a house to a black man and assigned him a member-ship share and use rights in a private park. The corporationthat owned the park would not approve the assignment tothe black lessee. Sullivan protested, and the corporation retaliated against him by expelling him and taking his shares.Sullivan sued the corporation, and we upheld Sullivan's causeof action under 42 U. S. C. $ 1982 for "[retaliation] for theadvocacy of [the black person's] cause." 396 U. S., at 237.Thus, in Sullivan we interpreted a general prohibition onracial discrimination to cover retaliation against those whoadvocate the rights of groups protected by that prohibition.1Congress enacted Title IX just three years after Sullivanwas decided, and accordingly that decision provides a valuable context for understanding the statute. As we recog-nized inCannon, "it is not only appropriate but also realisticto presume that Congress was thoroughly familiar with [Sullivan] and that it expected its enactment [of Title IX] to beinterpreted in conformity with [it]." 441 U. S., at 699; seealso id., at 698, n. 22.

Itplainly held that the white owner could maintain his own private cause ofaction under $ 1982 if he could show that he was "punished for trying tovindicate the rights of minorities." 396 U.

S. 167 (2005)Opinion of the Courtcrimination" "on the basis of sex," just as retaliation for ad-vocacy on behalf of a black lessee in Sullivan was discrimination on the basis of race. BThe Board contends that our decision in Alexander v. San-doval, 532 U. S. 275 (2001), compels a holding that Title IX'sprivate right of action does not encompass retaliation. San-doval involved an interpretation of Title VI of the CivilRights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252, as amended, 42 U. S. C.$ 2000d et seq., which provides in $ 601 that no person shall,"on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excludedfrom participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity" cov-ered by Title VI. 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d. Section 602 of TitleVI authorizes federal agencies to effectuate the provisionsin $ 601 by enacting regulations. Pursuant to that authority,the Department of Justice promulgated regulations prohibit-ing funding recipients from adopting policies that had "theeffect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because oftheir race, color, or national origin." 28 CFR $ 42.104(b)(2)(1999). The Sandoval petitioners brought suit to enjoin anEnglish-only policy of the Alabama Department of PublicSafety on grounds that it disparately impacted non-Englishspeakers in violation of the regulations. Though we assumed that the regulations themselves were valid, see 532U. S., at 281, we rejected the contention that the privateright of action to enforce intentional violations of Title VIencompassed suits to enforce the disparate-impact regulations. We did so because "[i]t is clear . . . that thedisparate-impact regulations do not simply apply $ 601--since they indeed forbid conduct that $ 601 permits--andtherefore clear that the private right of action to enforce$ 601 does not include a private right to enforce these regula-tions."Id., at 285.

OF ED.Opinion of the Court(1994) (A "private plaintiff may not bring a [suit based on aregulation] against a defendant for acts not prohibited bythe text of [the statute]"). Thus, Sandoval held that privateparties may not invoke Title VI regulations to obtain redressfor disparate-impact discrimination because Title VI itselfprohibits only intentional discrimination.The Board cites a Department of Education regulationprohibiting retaliation "against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by[Title IX]," 34 CFR $ 100.7(e) (2004) (incorporated by reference by $ 106.71), and contends that Jackson, like the peti-tioners inSandoval, seeks an "impermissible extension ofthe statute" when he argues that Title IX's private rightof action encompasses retaliation. Brief for Respondent 45.This argument, however, entirely misses the point. We donot rely on regulations extending Title IX's protection be-yond its statutory limits; indeed, we do not rely on the Department of Education's regulation at all, because the statuteitself contains the necessary prohibition. As we explainabove, see supra, at 174-175, the text of Title IX prohibits afunding recipient from retaliating against a person whospeaks out against sex discrimination, because such retaliation is intentional "discrimination" "on the basis of sex."We reach this result based on the statute's text. In stepwith Sandoval, we hold that Title IX's private right of actionencompasses suits for retaliation, because retaliation fallswithin the statute's prohibition of intentional discriminationon the basis of sex.22 We agree with Justice Thomas that plaintiffs may not assert claimsunder Title IX for conduct not prohibited by that statute. Post, at 193(dissenting opinion). See also Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. FirstInterstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 173 (1994) ("[T]he privateplaintiff may not bring a 10b-5 suit against a defendant for acts not prohibited by the text of $ 10(b)"). But we part ways with regard to ourreading of the statute. We interpret Title IX's text to clearly prohibitretaliation for complaints about sex discrimination.544US1 Unit: $U33 [11-02-07 18:03:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN179Cite as: 544 U. S. 167 (2005)Opinion of the CourtCNor are we convinced by the Board's argument that, evenif Title IX's private right of action encompasses discrimination, Jackson is not entitled to invoke it because he is an"indirect victi[m]" of sex discrimination. Brief for Respondent 33. The statute is broadly worded; it does not requirethat the victim of the retaliation must also be the victim ofthe discrimination that is the subject of the original com-plaint. If the statute provided instead that "no person shallbe subjected to discrimination on the basis of such individual's sex," then we would agree with the Board. Cf. 42U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1) ("It shall be an unlawful employmentpractice for an employer . . . to discriminate against any individual . . . because of such individual's race, color, religion,sex, or national origin" (emphasis added)). However, TitleIX contains no such limitation. Where the retaliation oc-curs because the complainant speaks out about sex discrimination, the "on the basis of sex" requirement is satisfied.The complainant is himself a victim of discriminatory retaliation, regardless of whether he was the subject of the originalcomplaint.3 As we explain above, see supra, at 176-177, thisis consistent with Sullivan, which formed an important part3 Justice Thomas contends that "extending the implied cause of actionunder Title IX to claims of retaliation expands the class of people thestatute protects beyond the specified beneficiaries." Post, at 194 (dissenting opinion). But Title IX's beneficiaries plainly include all those who aresubjected to "discrimination" "on the basis of sex." 20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a).Because, as we explain above, see supra, at 174-175, retaliation in response to a complaint about sex discrimination is "discrimination" "on thebasis of sex," the statute clearly protects those who suffer such retaliation.The following hypothetical, offered by petitioner at oral argument, illustrates this point: If the male captain of the boys' basketball team and thefemale captain of the girls' basketball team together approach the schoolprincipal to complain about discrimination against the girls' team, and theprincipal retaliates by expelling them both from the honor society, thenboth the female and the male captains have been "discriminated" against"on the basis of sex." Tr. of Oral Arg. 53-54.544US1 Unit: $U33 [11-02-07 18:03:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN180 JACKSON v. BIRMINGHAM BD. OF ED.Opinion of the Courtof the backdrop against which Congress enacted Title IX.Sullivan made clear that retaliation claims extend to thosewho oppose discrimination against others. See 396 U. S., at237 (holding that a person may bring suit under 42 U. S. C.$ 1982 if he can show that he was "punished for trying tovindicate the rights of minorities").Congress enacted Title IX not only to prevent the use offederal dollars to support discriminatory practices, but also"to provide individual citizens effective protection againstthose practices." Cannon, 441 U. S., at 704. We agree withthe United States that this objective "would be difficult, ifnot impossible, to achieve if persons who complain about sexdiscrimination did not have effective protection against retaliation." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13.If recipients were permitted to retaliate freely, individualswho witness discrimination would be loath to report it, andall manner of Title IX violations might go unremedied asa result. See Sullivan, supra, at 237 (noting that withoutprotection against retaliation, the underlying discriminationis perpetuated).Reporting incidents of discrimination is integral to TitleIX enforcement and would be discouraged if retaliationagainst those who report went unpunished. Indeed, if retaliation were not prohibited, Title IX's enforcement schemewould unravel. Recall that Congress intended Title IX'sprivate right of action to encompass claims of a recipient'sdeliberate indifference to sexual harassment. See generallyDavis, 526 U. S. 629. Accordingly, if a principal sexuallyharasses a student, and a teacher complains to the schoolboard but the school board is indifferent, the board wouldlikely be liable for a Title IX violation. See generallyGebser, 524 U. S. 274. But if Title IX's private right of action does not encompass retaliation claims, the teacher wouldhave no recourse if he were subsequently fired for speakingout. Without protection from retaliation, individuals whowitness discrimination would likely not report it, indiffer544US1 Unit: $U33 [11-02-07 18:03:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN181Cite as: 544 U. S. 167 (2005)Opinion of the Courtence claims would be short circuited, and the underlying dis-crimination would go unremedied.Title IX's enforcement scheme also depends on individualreporting because individuals and agencies may not bringsuit under the statute unless the recipient has received "ac-tual notice" of the discrimination. Id., at 288, 289-290 (holding that an appropriate official of the funding recipient musthave actual knowledge of discrimination and respond withdeliberate indifference before a private party may bringsuit); 20 U. S. C. $ 1682 (providing that a federal agency mayterminate funding only after it "has advised the appropriateperson or persons of the failure to comply with the requirement and has determined that compliance cannot be securedby voluntary means"). If recipients were able to avoid suchnotice by retaliating against all those who dare complain,the statute's enforcement scheme would be subverted. Weshould not assume that Congress left such a gap in itsscheme.Moreover, teachers and coaches such as Jackson areoften in the best position to vindicate the rights of theirstudents because they are better able to identify discrimina-tion and bring it to the attention of administrators. Indeed,sometimes adult employees are " `the only effective adver-sar[ies]' " of discrimination in schools. See Sullivan, supra,at 237 ("[A] white owner is at times `the only effective adver-sary' of the unlawful restrictive covenant" (citing Barrows v.Jackson, 346 U. S. 249, 259 (1953))).DThe Board is correct in pointing out that, because Title IXwas enacted as an exercise of Congress' powers under theSpending Clause, see, e. g., Davis, supra, at 640; Gebser,supra, at 287; Franklin, 503 U. S., at 74-75, and n. 8, "privatedamages actions are available only where recipients of federal funding had adequate notice that they could be liable forthe conduct at issue,"Davis, supra, at 640.

Halderman, 451U. S. 1, 17 (1981). As we have recognized, "[t]here can . . .be no knowing acceptance [of the terms of the contract] if aState is unaware of the conditions [imposed by the legislationon its receipt of funds]." Ibid.The Board insists that we should not interpret Title IX toprohibit retaliation because it was not on notice that it couldbe held liable for retaliating against those who complain ofTitle IX violations. We disagree. Funding recipients havebeen on notice that they could be subjected to private suitsfor intentional sex discrimination under Title IX since 1979,when we decided Cannon. Pennhurst does not precludeprivate suits for intentional acts that clearly violate Title IX.Davis, supra, at 642.Indeed, in Davis, we held that Pennhurst did not pose anobstacle to private suits for damages in cases of a recipient'sdeliberate indifference to one student's sexual harassment ofanother, because the deliberate indifference constituted intentional discrimination on the basis of sex. Davis, supra,at 650. See also Franklin, supra, at 75 ("Congress surelydid not intend for federal moneys to be expended to supportthe intentional actions it sought by statute to proscribe").Similarly, we held in Gebser that a recipient of federal funding could be held liable for damages under Title IX for deliberate indifference to a teacher's harassment of a student.524 U. S., at 287-288. In Gebser, as in Davis, we acknowledged that federal funding recipients must have notice thatthey will be held liable for damages. See Davis, supra, at642; Gebser, supra, at 287. But we emphasized that "thislimitation on private damages actions is not a bar to liabilitywhere a funding recipient intentionally violates the statute."Davis, supra, at 642 (citing Franklin, 503 U. S., at 74-75).See also ibid. ("[T]he [Pennhurst] notice problem does not544US1 Unit: $U33 [11-02-07 18:03:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN183Cite as: 544 U.

S.656, 665-666 (1985) (holding that there was sufficient no-tice underPennhurst where a statute made clear that someconditions were placed on the receipt of federal funds, andstating that Congress need not "specifically identif[y] andproscrib[e]" each condition in the legislation). Simply put,"Pennhurst does not bar a private damages action underTitle IX where the funding recipient engages in intentionalconduct that violates the clear terms of the statute." Davis,supra, at 642.Thus, the Board should have been put on notice by the factthat our cases since Cannon, such as Gebser and Davis, haveconsistently interpreted Title IX's private cause of actionbroadly to encompass diverse forms of intentional sex discrimination. Indeed, retaliation presents an even easiercase than deliberate indifference. It is easily attributableto the funding recipient, and it is always--by definition--intentional. We therefore conclude that retaliation againstindividuals because they complain of sex discrimination is"intentional conduct that violates the clear terms of the statute," Davis, 526 U. S., at 642, and that Title IX itself therefore supplied sufficient notice to the Board that it could notretaliate against Jackson after he complained of discrimination against the girls' basketball team.The regulations implementing Title IX clearly prohibit retaliation and have been on the books for nearly 30 years.Cf., e. g., id., at 643 (holding that Title IX's regulatoryscheme "has long provided funding recipients with noticethat they may be liable for their failure to respond to thediscriminatory acts of certain nonagents"). More importantly, the Courts of Appeals that had considered the question at the time of the conduct at issue in this case all hadalready interpreted Title IX to cover retaliation. See, e. g.,Lowrey, 117 F. 3d, at 252; Preston, 31 F. 3d, at 206. TheBoard could not have realistically supposed that, given this544US1 Unit: $U33 [11-02-07 18:03:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN184 JACKSON v. BIRMINGHAM BD. OF ED.Thomas, J., dissentingcontext, it remained free to retaliate against those who re-ported sex discrimination. Cf.Davis, supra, at 644 (statingthat the common law of torts "has put schools on notice thatthey may be held responsible under state law for their failureto protect students from the tortious acts of third parties").A reasonable school board would realize that institutionscovered by Title IX cannot cover up violations of that lawby means of discriminatory retaliation.To prevail on the merits, Jackson will have to prove thatthe Board retaliated against him because he complained ofsex discrimination. The amended complaint alleges that theBoard retaliated against Jackson for complaining to his su-pervisor, Ms. Evelyn Baugh, about sex discrimination at Ensley High School. At this stage of the proceedings, "[t]heissue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail butwhether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to supportthe claims."Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 236 (1974).Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for theEleventh Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded forfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.
