The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment tothe United States Constitution prohibits successive prosecution or multiple punishment for "the same offence." Thiscase, which involves application of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, asks us to consider whether a court vio-lates that proscription by convicting and sentencing a defendant for a crime when the conduct underlying that offensehas been considered in determining the defendant's sentencefor a previous conviction. IIn June 1990, petitioner Steven Kurt Witte and severalco-conspirators, including Dennis Mason and Tom Pokorny,arranged with Roger Norman, an undercover agent of theDrug Enforcement Administration, to import large amountsof marijuana from Mexico and cocaine from Guatemala.Norman had the task of flying the contraband into the UnitedStates, with Witte providing the ground transportation forthe drugs once they had been brought into the country. Thefollowing month, the Mexican marijuana source advised theconspiracy participants that cocaine might be added to the*Peter Goldberger and Scott A.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtfirst shipment if there was room on the plane or if an insuffi-cient quantity of marijuana was available. Norman was informed in August 1990 that the source was prepared to de-liver 4,400 pounds of marijuana. Once Norman learned thelocation of the airstrip from which the narcotics would betransported, federal agents arranged to have the partici-pants in the scheme apprehended in Mexico. Local authorities arrested Mason and four others on August 12 and seized591 kilograms of cocaine at the landing field. While stillundercover, Norman met Witte the following day to explainthat the pilots had been unable to land in Mexico becausepolice had raided the airstrip. Witte was not taken into custody at that time, and the activities of the conspiracy lapsedfor several months.Agent Norman next spoke with Witte in January 1991and asked if Witte would be interested in purchasing 1,000pounds of marijuana. Witte agreed, promised to obtain a$50,000 down payment, and indicated that he would transport the marijuana in a horse trailer he had purchased forthe original 1990 transaction and in a motor home ownedby an acquaintance, Sam Kelly. On February 7, Witte, Norman, and Kelly met in Houston, Texas. Norman agreed togive the drugs to Witte in exchange for the $25,000 in cashWitte had been able to secure at that time and for a promiseto pay the balance of the down payment in three days. Undercover agents took the motor home and trailer away to loadthe marijuana, and Witte escorted Norman to Witte's hotelroom to view the money. The agents returned the vehiclesthe next morning loaded with approximately 375 pounds ofmarijuana, and they arrested Witte and Kelly when the twomen took possession of the contraband.In March 1991, a federal grand jury in the SouthernDistrict of Texas indicted Witte and Kelly for conspiring andattempting to possess marijuana with intent to distribute it,in violation of 21 U. S. C. $$ 841(a) and 846. The indictmentwas limited on its face to conduct occurring on or about515us1$77J 08-11-98 21:55:34 PAGES OPINPGT393Cite as: 515 U. S. 389 (1995)Opinion of the CourtJanuary 25 through February 8, 1991, thus covering only thelater marijuana transaction. On February 21, 1992, Wittepleaded guilty to the attempted possession count and agreedto cooperate "with the Government by providing truthfuland complete information concerning this and all otheroffenses about which [he] might be questioned by agents oflaw enforcement," and by testifying if requested to do so.App. 14. In exchange, the Government agreed to dismissthe conspiracy count and, if Witte's cooperation amountedto "substantial assistance," to file a motion for a downwarddeparture under the Sentencing Guidelines. See UnitedStates Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 5K1.1(Nov. 1994) (USSG).In calculating Witte's base offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines, the presentence report prepared by theUnited States Probation Office considered the total quantityof drugs involved in all of the transactions contemplated bythe conspirators, including the planned 1990 shipments ofboth marijuana and cocaine. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, the sentencing range for a particular offense is determined on the basis of all "relevant conduct" in which thedefendant was engaged and not just with regard to the conduct underlying the offense of conviction. USSG $ 1B1.3.The Sentencing Commission has noted that, "[w]ith respectto offenses involving contraband (including controlled substances), the defendant is accountable for all quantities ofcontraband with which he was directly involved and, in thecase of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, all reasonablyforeseeable quantities of contraband that were within thescope of the criminal activity that he jointly undertook."USSG $ 1B1.3, comment., n. 2; see also USSG $ 2D1.1, comment., nn. 6, 12. The presentence report therefore suggested that Witte was accountable for the 1,000 pounds ofmarijuana involved in the attempted possession offense towhich he pleaded guilty, 15 tons of marijuana that Witte,Mason, and Pokorny had planned to import from Mexico in515us1$77J 08-11-98 21:55:34 PAGES OPINPGT394 WITTE v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court1990, 500 kilograms of cocaine that the conspirators origi-nally proposed to import from Guatemala, and the 591 kilograms of cocaine seized at the Mexican airstrip in August1990.At the sentencing hearing, both petitioner and the Government urged the court to hold that the 1990 activities concern-ing importation of cocaine and marijuana were not part ofthe same course of conduct as the 1991 marijuana offense towhich Witte had pleaded guilty, and therefore should not beconsidered in sentencing for the 1991 offense. The DistrictCourt concluded, however, that because the 1990 importationoffenses were part of the same continuing conspiracy, theywere "relevant conduct" under $ 1B1.3 of the Guidelines andshould be taken into account. The court therefore acceptedthe presentence report's aggregation of the quantities ofdrugs involved in the 1990 and 1991 episodes, resulting in abase offense level of 40, with a Guideline range of 292 to 365months' imprisonment. App. 80-81; see also USSG $ 2D1.1.From that base offense level, Witte received a two-level increase for his aggravating role in the offense, see USSG$ 3B1.1, and an offsetting two-level decrease for acceptanceof responsibility, see USSG $ 3E1.1. Finally, the courtgranted the Government's $ 5K1.1 motion for downward departure based on Witte's substantial assistance. By virtueof that departure, the court sentenced Witte to 144 monthsin prison, see App. 76, which was 148 months below the minimum sentence of 292 months under the predeparture Guideline range. Witte appealed, but the Court of Appeals dismissed the case when Witte failed to file a brief.In September 1992, another grand jury in the same districtreturned a two-count indictment against Witte and Pokornyfor conspiring and attempting to import cocaine, in violationof 21 U. S. C. $$ 952(a) and 963. The indictment alleged that,between August 1989 and August 1990, Witte tried to importabout 1,091 kilograms of cocaine from Central America.Witte moved to dismiss, arguing that he had already been515us1$77J 08-11-98 21:55:34 PAGES OPINPGT395Cite as: 515 U. S. 389 (1995)Opinion of the Courtpunished for the cocaine offenses because the cocaine in-volved in the 1990 transactions had been considered as "relevant conduct" at sentencing for the 1991 marijuana offense.The District Court dismissed the indictment in February1993 on grounds that punishment for the indicted offenseswould violate the prohibition against multiple punishmentscontained in the Double Jeopardy Clause of the FifthAmendment. App. 130-136.The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed. 25F. 3d 250 (1994). Relying on our decision inWilliams v.Oklahoma, 358 U. S. 576 (1959), the court held that "the useof relevant conduct to increase the punishment of a chargedoffense does not punish the offender for the relevant conduct." 25 F. 3d, at 258. Thus, although the sentencingcourt took the quantity of cocaine involved in the 1990 importation scheme into account when determining the sentencefor Witte's 1991 marijuana possession offense, the Court ofAppeals concluded that Witte had not been punished for thecocaine offenses in the first prosecution--and that the DoubleJeopardy Clause therefore did not bar the later action. Inreaching this result, the court expressly disagreed with contrary holdings in United States v. Koonce, 945 F. 2d 1145(CA10 1991), cert. denied, 503 U. S. 994 (1992), and UnitedStates v. McCormick, 992 F. 2d 437 (CA2 1993), that when adefendant's actions are included in relevant conduct in determining the punishment under the Sentencing Guidelines forone offense, those actions may not form the basis for a laterindictment without violating double jeopardy. We grantedcertiorari to resolve the conflict among the Circuits, 513 U. S.1072 (1995), and now affirm.IIThe Double Jeopardy Clause provides: "[N]or shall anyperson be subject for the same offence to be twice put injeopardy of life or limb." U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. We haveexplained that "the Clause serves the function of preventing515us1$77J 08-11-98 21:55:34 PAGES OPINPGT396 WITTE v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtboth successive punishment and successive prosecution,"United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 704 (1993) (citing NorthCarolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711 (1969)), and that "the Constitution was designed as much to prevent the criminal frombeing twice punished for the same offence as from beingtwice tried for it," Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 173 (1874).See also Schiro v. Farley, 510 U. S. 222, 229-230 (1994);United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 440, 451, n. 10 (1989).Significantly, the language of the Double Jeopardy Clauseprotects against more than the actual imposition of two punishments for the same offense; by its terms, it protects acriminal defendant from being twice put in jeopardy for suchpunishment. See Price v. Georgia, 398 U. S. 323, 326 (1970).That is, the Double Jeopardy Clause "prohibits merely punishing twice, or attempting a second time to punish criminally, for the same offense." Helvering v. Mitchell, 303U. S. 391, 399 (1938) (emphasis added).Petitioner clearly was neither prosecuted for nor convictedof the cocaine offenses during the first criminal proceeding.The offense to which petitioner pleaded guilty and for whichhe was sentenced in 1992 was attempted possession of marijuana with intent to distribute it, whereas the crimescharged in the instant indictment are conspiracy to importcocaine and attempted importation of the same. UnderBlockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299, 304 (1932),"where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation oftwo distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied todetermine whether there are two offenses or only one, iswhether each provision requires proof of a fact which theother does not." See also Dixon, supra, at 696 (emphasizingthat the same inquiry generally applies "[i]n both the multiple punishment and multiple prosecution contexts"). Underthe Blockburger test, the indictment in this case did notcharge the same offense to which petitioner formerly hadpleaded guilty.515us1$77J 08-11-98 21:55:34 PAGES OPINPGT397Cite as: 515 U. S. 389 (1995)Opinion of the CourtPetitioner nevertheless argues that, because the conductgiving rise to the cocaine chargeswas taken into accountduring sentencing for the marijuana conviction, he effec-tively was "punished" for that conduct during the first proceeding. As a result, he contends, the Double JeopardyClause bars the instant prosecution. This claim is ripe atthis stage of the prosecution--although petitioner has notyet been convicted of the cocaine offenses--because, as wehave said, "courts may not impose more than one punishmentfor the same offense and prosecutors ordinarily may not at-tempt to secure that punishment in more than one trial."Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161, 165 (1977). See also Ball v.United States, 470 U. S. 856, 861, 864-865 (1985) (explainingthat, for purposes of the double jeopardy inquiry, punishment"must be the equivalent of a criminal conviction and not simply the imposition of sentence"); Ex parte Lange, supra, at173. Thus, if petitioner is correct that the present case constitutes a second attempt to punish him criminally for thesame cocaine offenses, see Helvering, supra, at 399, then theprosecution may not proceed. We agree with the Court ofAppeals, however, that petitioner's double jeopardy theory--that consideration of uncharged conduct in arriving at a sentence within the statutorily authorized punishment rangeconstitutes "punishment" for that conduct--is not supportedby our precedents, which make clear that a defendant in thatsituation is punished, for double jeopardy purposes, only forthe offense of which the defendant is convicted.Traditionally, "[s]entencing courts have not only taken intoconsideration a defendant's prior convictions, but have alsoconsidered a defendant's past criminal behavior, even if noconviction resulted from that behavior." Nichols v. UnitedStates, 511 U. S. 738, 747 (1994). We explained in Williamsv. New York, 337 U. S. 241, 246 (1949), that "both before andsince the American colonies became a nation, courts in thiscountry and in England practiced a policy under which a sentencing judge could exercise a wide discretion in the sources515us1$77J 08-11-98 21:55:34 PAGES OPINPGT398 WITTE v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtand types of evidence used to assist him in determining thekind and extent of punishment to be imposed within limitsfixed by law." That history, combined with a recognition ofthe need for individualized sentencing, led us to concludethat the Due Process Clause did not require "that courtsthroughout the Nation abandon their age-old practice ofseeking information from out-of-court sources to guide theirjudgment toward a more enlightened and just sentence."Id., at 250-251. Thus, "[a]s a general proposition, a sentencing judge `may appropriately conduct an inquiry broad inscope, largely unlimited either as to the kind of informationhe may consider, or the source from which it may come.' "Nichols, supra, at 747 (quoting United States v. Tucker, 404U. S. 443, 446 (1972)). See also Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508U. S. 476, 485 (1993).Against this background of sentencing history, we specifically have rejected the claim that double jeopardy principlesbar a later prosecution or punishment for criminal activitywhere that activity has been considered at sentencing for aseparate crime. Williams v. Oklahoma, 358 U. S., at 576,arose out of a kidnaping and murder committed by the petitioner while attempting to escape from police after a robbery. Following his arrest, Williams pleaded guilty to murder and was given a life sentence. He was later convictedof kidnaping, which was then a capital offense in Oklahoma,and the sentencing court took into account, in assessing thedeath penalty, the fact that the kidnaping victim had beenmurdered. We rejected Williams' contention that this useof the conduct that had given rise to the prior convictionviolated double jeopardy. Emphasizing that "the exerciseof a sound discretion in such a case required consideration ofall the circumstances of the crime," we made clear that "oneof the aggravating circumstances involved in this kidnapingcrime was the fact that petitioner shot and killed the victimin the course of its commission," and rejected the claim "thatthe sentencing judge was not entitled to consider that cir515us1$77J 08-11-98 21:55:34 PAGES OPINPGT399Cite as: 515 U. S. 389 (1995)Opinion of the Courtcumstance, along with all the other circumstances involved,in determining the proper sentence to be imposed for thekidnaping crime." Id., at 585-586. We then disposed of thepetitioner's double jeopardy claim as follows: "[I]n view ofthe obvious fact that, under the law of Oklahoma, kidnapingis a separate crime, entirely distinct from the crime of mur-der, the court's consideration of the murder as a circumstance involved in the kidnaping crime cannot be said to haveresulted in punishing petitioner a second time for the sameoffense . . . ." Id., at 586. We thus made clear that use ofevidence of related criminal conduct to enhance a defendant'ssentence for a separate crime within the authorized statutory limits does not constitute punishment for that conductwithin the meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause.We find this case to be governed by Williams; it makes nodifference in this context whether the enhancement occurredin the first or second sentencing proceeding. Here, petitioner pleaded guilty to attempted possession of marijuanawith intent to distribute it, in violation of 21 U. S. C. $$ 841(a)and 846. The statute provides that the sentence for such acrime involving 100 kilograms or more of marijuana mustbe between 5 and 40 years in prison. $ 841(b)(1)(B). By including the cocaine from the earlier transaction--and notjust the marijuana involved in the offense of conviction--inthe drug quantity calculation, the District Court ended upwith a higher offense level (40), and a higher sentence range(292 to 365 months), than it would have otherwise under theapplicable Guideline, which specifies different base offenselevels depending on the quantity of drugs involved. USSG$ 2D1.1. This higher Guideline range, however, still fallswithin the scope of the legislatively authorized penalty (5 to40 years). As in Williams, the uncharged criminal conductwas used to enhance petitioner's sentence within the rangeauthorized by statute. If use of the murder to justify thedeath sentence for the kidnaping conviction was not "punishment" for the murder in Williams, it is impossible to con515us1$77J 08-11-98 21:55:34 PAGES OPINPGT400 WITTE v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtclude that taking account of petitioner's plans to import co-caine in fixing the sentence for the marijuana convictionconstituted "punishment" for the cocaine offenses.Williams, like this case, concerned the double jeopardyimplications of taking the circumstances surrounding a particular course of criminal activity into account in sentencingfor a conviction arising therefrom. Similarly, we have madeclear in other cases, which involved a defendant's backgroundmore generally and not conduct arising out of the same criminal transaction as the offense of which the defendant wasconvicted, that "[e]nhancement statutes, whether in the nature of criminal history provisions such as those containedin the Sentencing Guidelines, or recidivist statutes which arecommon place in state criminal laws, do not change the penalty imposed for the earlier conviction." Nichols, 511 U. S.,at 747 (approving consideration of a defendant's previousuncounseled misdemeanor conviction in sentencing him fora subsequent offense). In repeatedly upholding such recidivism statutes, we have rejected double jeopardy challengesbecause the enhanced punishment imposed for the later offense "is not to be viewed as either a new jeopardy or additional penalty for the earlier crimes," but instead as "a stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered to bean aggravated offense because a repetitive one." Gryger v.Burke, 334 U. S. 728, 732 (1948). See also Spencer v. Texas,385 U. S. 554, 560 (1967); Oyler v. Boles, 368 U. S. 448, 451(1962); Moore v. Missouri, 159 U. S. 673, 677 (1895) (under arecidivist statute, "the accused is not again punished for thefirst offence" because " `the punishment is for the last offencecommitted, and it is rendered more severe in consequence ofthe situation into which the party had previously broughthimself ' ").In addition, by authorizing the consideration of offenderspecific information at sentencing without the proceduralprotections attendant at a criminal trial, our cases necessarily imply that such consideration does not result in "punish515us1$77J 08-11-98 21:55:34 PAGES OPINPGT401Cite as: 515 U. S. 389 (1995)Opinion of the Courtment" for such conduct. In McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477U. S. 79 (1986), we upheld against a due process challengePennsylvania's Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act, whichimposed a 5-year minimum sentence for certain enumeratedfelonies if the sentencing judge found, by a preponderance ofthe evidence, that the defendant "visibly possessed a fire-arm" during the commission of the offense. Significantly,we emphasized that the statute at issue "neither alters themaximum penalty for the crime committed nor creates a separate offense calling for a separate penalty; it operates solelyto limit the sentencing court's discretion in selecting a penalty within the range already available to it without the special finding of visible possession of a firearm." Id., at 87-88.That is, the statute "simply took one factor that has alwaysbeen considered by sentencing courts to bear on punishment--the instrumentality used in committing a violent felony--and dictated the precise weight to be given that factorif the instrumentality is a firearm." Id., at 89-90. For thisreason, we approved the lesser standard of proof providedfor in the statute, thereby "reject[ing] the claim that whenever a State links the `severity of punishment' to `the presence or absence of an identified fact' the State must provethat fact beyond a reasonable doubt." Id., at 84 (quotingPatterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 214 (1977)). Thesedecisions reinforce our conclusion that consideration of information about the defendant's character and conduct atsentencing does not result in "punishment" for any offenseother than the one of which the defendant was convicted.We are not persuaded by petitioner's suggestion that theSentencing Guidelines somehow change the constitutionalanalysis. A defendant has not been "punished" any morefor double jeopardy purposes when relevant conduct is included in the calculation of his offense level under the Guidelines than when a pre-Guidelines court, in its discretion, tooksimilar uncharged conduct into account. Cf. McMillan,supra, at 92 (perceiving no difference in the due process cal515us1$77J 08-11-98 21:55:34 PAGES OPINPGT402 WITTE v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtculus depending upon whether consideration of the sentenc-ing factor was discretionary or mandatory). As the Government argues, "[t]he fact that the sentencing process hasbecome more transparent under the Guidelines . . . does notmean that the defendant is now being `punished' for uncharged relevant conduct as though it were a distinct crimi-nal `offense.' " Brief for United States 23. The relevantconduct provisions are designed to channel the sentencingdiscretion of the district courts and to make mandatory theconsideration of factors that previously would have been op-tional.United States v. Wright, 873 F. 2d 437, 441 (CA11989) (Breyer, J.) (explaining that, "very roughly speaking,[relevant conduct] corresponds to those actions and circumstances that courts typically took into account when sentencing prior to the Guidelines' enactment"). See also Burns v.United States, 501 U. S. 129, 133 (1991); Mistretta v. UnitedStates, 488 U. S. 361, 363-367 (1989). Regardless of whetherparticular conduct is taken into account by rule or as an actof discretion, the defendant is still being punished only forthe offense of conviction.Justice Stevens disagrees with our conclusion because,he contends, "[u]nder the Guidelines, . . . an offense that isincluded as `relevant conduct' does not relate to the characterof the offender (which is reflected instead by criminal history), but rather measures only the character of the offense."Post, at 411. The criminal history section of the Guidelines,however, does not seem to create this bright line distinction;indeed, the difference between "criminal history" and "relevant conduct" is more temporal than qualitative, with theformer referring simply to a defendant's past criminal conduct (as evidenced by convictions and prison terms), seeUSSG $ 4A1.1, and the latter covering activity arising out ofthe same course of criminal conduct as the instant offense,see USSG $ 1B1.3.To the extent that the Guidelines aggravate punishmentfor related conduct outside the elements of the crime on the515us1$77J 08-11-98 21:55:34 PAGES OPINPGT403Cite as: 515 U. S. 389 (1995)Opinion of the Courttheory that such conduct bears on the "character of the of-fense," the offender is still punished only for the fact that thepresent offense was carried out in a manner that warrantsincreased punishment, not for adifferent offense (which thatrelated conduct may or may not constitute). But, while relevant conduct thus may relate to the severity of the particu-lar crime, the commission of multiple offenses in the samecourse of conduct also necessarily provides important evi-dence that the character of the offender requires special punishment. Similarly, as we have said in the recidivism cases,a crime committed by an offender with a prior conviction "isconsidered to be an aggravated offense because a repetitiveone." Gryger, 334 U. S., at 732. Nothing about the labelsgiven to these categories controls the use to which suchinformation is put at sentencing. Under the Guidelines,therefore, as under the traditional sentencing regimes Justice Stevens approves, "it is difficult if not impossible todetermine whether a given offense has affected the judge'sassessment of the character of the offender, the character ofthe offense, or both." Post, at 411 (Stevens, J., dissenting).Even under Justice Stevens' framework, the structure ofthe Guidelines should not affect the outcome of this case.The relevant conduct provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines, like their criminal history counterparts and the recidivism statutes discussed above, are sentencing enhancementregimes evincing the judgment that a particular offenseshould receive a more serious sentence within the authorizedrange if it was either accompanied by or preceded by additional criminal activity. Petitioner does not argue that therange fixed by Congress is so broad, and the enhancing roleplayed by the relevant conduct so significant, that consideration of that conduct in sentencing has become "a tail whichwags the dog of the substantive offense." McMillan, 477U. S., at 88; cf. Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 700 (1975).We hold that, where the legislature has authorized such aparticular punishment range for a given crime, the resulting515us1$77J 08-11-98 21:55:34 PAGES OPINPGT404 WITTE v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtsentence within that range constitutes punishment only forthe offense of conviction for purposes of the double jeopardyinquiry. Accordingly, the instant prosecution for the cocaineoffenses is not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause as asecond attempt to punish petitioner for the same crime.IIIAt its core, much of petitioner's argument addresses not aclaim that the instant cocaine prosecution violates principlesof double jeopardy, but the more modest contention that heshould not receive a second sentence under the Guidelinesfor the cocaine activities that were considered as relevantconduct for the marijuana sentence. As an examination ofthe pertinent sections should make clear, however, theGuidelines take into account the potential unfairness withwhich petitioner is concerned.Petitioner argues that the Sentencing Guidelines requirethat drug offenders be sentenced in a single proceeding forall related offenses, whether charged or uncharged. SeeBrief for Petitioner 20-23. Yet while the Guidelines cer-tainly envision that sentences for multiple offenses arisingout of the same criminal activity ordinarily will be imposedtogether, they also explicitly contemplate the possibility ofseparate prosecutions involving the same or overlapping"relevant conduct." See USSG $ 5G1.3, comment., n. 2 (addressing cases in which "a defendant is prosecuted in . . . twoor more federal jurisdictions, for the same criminal conductor for different criminal transactions that were part of thesame course of conduct"). There are often valid reasonswhy related crimes committed by the same defendant arenot prosecuted in the same proceeding, and $ 5G1.3 of theGuidelines attempts to achieve some coordination of sen-tences imposed in such situations with an eye toward having such punishments approximate the total penalty thatwould have been imposed had the sentences for the different offenses been imposed at the same time (i. e., had all515us1$77J 08-11-98 21:55:34 PAGES OPINPGT405Cite as: 515 U. S. 389 (1995)Opinion of the Courtof the offenses been prosecuted in a single proceeding). SeeUSSG $ 5G1.3, comment., n. 3.Because the concept of relevant conduct under the Guide-lines is reciprocal, $ 5G1.3 operates to mitigate the possibilitythat the fortuity of two separate prosecutions will grosslyincrease a defendant's sentence. If a defendant is servingan undischarged term of imprisonment "result[ing] from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account [as relevantconduct] in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense," $ 5G1.3(b) provides that "the sentence for theinstant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to theundischarged term of imprisonment." And where $ 5G1.3(b)does not apply, an accompanying policy statement provides,"the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to runconsecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to the extent necessary to achieve a reasonableincremental punishment for the instant offense." USSG$ 5G1.3(c) (policy statement). Significant safeguards builtinto the Sentencing Guidelines therefore protect petitioneragainst having the length of his sentence multiplied by duplicative consideration of the same criminal conduct; he wouldbe able to vindicate his interests through appropriate appeals should the Guidelines be misapplied in any futuresentencing proceeding.Even if the Sentencing Commission had not formalizedsentencing for multiple convictions in this way, districtcourts under the Guidelines retain enough flexibility in appropriate cases to take into account the fact that conductunderlying the offense at issue has previously been takeninto account in sentencing for another offense. As the Commission has explained, "[u]nder 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(b) the sentencing court may impose a sentence outside the range established by the applicable guideline, if the court finds `thatthere exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of akind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into considerationby the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines515us1$77J 08-11-98 21:55:34 PAGES OPINPGT406 WITTE v. UNITED STATESScalia, J., concurring in judgmentthat should result in a sentence different from that de-scribed.' " USSG $ 5K2.0 (policy statement). This departure power is also available to protect against petitioner'ssecond major practical concern: that a second sentence forthe same relevant conduct may deprive him of the effect ofthe downward departure under $ 5K1.1 of the Guidelines forsubstantial assistance to the Government, which reduced hisfirst sentence significantly. Should petitioner be convictedof the cocaine charges, he will be free to put his argumentconcerning the unusual facts of this case to the sentencingjudge as a basis for discretionary downward departure.IVBecause consideration of relevant conduct in determininga defendant's sentence within the legislatively authorizedpunishment range does not constitute punishment for thatconduct, the instant prosecution does not violate the DoubleJeopardy Clause's prohibition against the imposition of mul-tiple punishments for the same offense. Accordingly, thejudgment of the Court of Appeals is
