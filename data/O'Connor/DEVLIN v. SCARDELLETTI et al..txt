Petitioner, a nonnamed member of a class certified underFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1), sought to appealthe approval of a settlement over objections he stated at thefairness hearing.

SCARDELLETTIOpinion of the Courthe had not successfully moved to intervene in the litigation.We now reverse.IPetitioner Robert Devlin, a retired worker representedby the Transportation Communications International Union(Union), participates in a defined benefits pension plan (Plan)administered by the Union. In 1991, on the recommendation of the Plan's trustees, the Plan was amended to add acost of living adjustment (COLA) for retired and active employees. As it turned out, however, the Plan was not ableto support such a large benefits increase. To address thisproblem, the Plan's new trustees sought to freeze the COLA.Because they were concerned about incurring Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) liability byeliminating the COLA for retired workers, see 29 U. S. C.$ 1054(g)(1) (1994 ed.) (providing that accrued benefits "maynot be decreased by an amendment of the plan"), the trusteesfroze the COLA only as to active employees. Because thePlan still lacked sufficient funds, the new trustees obtainedan equitable decree from the United States District Courtfor the District of Maryland in 1995 declaring that the formertrustees had breached their fiduciary duties and that endingthe COLA for retired workers would not violate ERISA.Scardelletti v. Bobo, 897 F. Supp. 913 (Md. 1995); Scardellettiv.Bobo, No. JFM-95-52 (D. Md., Sept. 8, 1997). Accord-ingly, in a 1997 amendment, the new trustees eliminated theCOLA for all Plan members.In October 1997, those trustees filed the present class action in the United States District Court for the District ofMaryland, seeking a declaratory judgment that the 1997amendment was binding on all Plan members or, alterna-tively, that the 1991 COLA amendment was void. Originally, petitioner was proposed as a class representative for asubclass of retired workers because of his previous involvement in the issue. He refused to become a named repre-sentative, however, preferring to bring a separate action in536US1 Unit: $U57 [12-16-03 19:06:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN5Cite as: 536 U. S. 1 (2002)Opinion of the Courtthe United States District Court for the Southern District ofNew York, arguing, among other things, that the 1997 Planamendment violated the Age Discrimination in EmploymentAct of 1967, 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 621et seq.(1994 ed. and Supp. V). The New York District Court dis-missed petitioner's claim involving the 1997 amendment,which was later affirmed by the Second Circuit because:"The exact COLA issue that the appellants are pursuing . . . is being addressed by the district court inMaryland. . . . It seems eminently sensible that theMaryland district court should resolve fully the COLAamendment issue."Devlin v. Transportation Communications Int'l Union, 175 F. 3d 121, 132 (CA2 1999).At the time petitioner's claim was dismissed, the DistrictCourt in Maryland had already conditionally certified a classunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1), dividing itinto two subclasses: a subclass of active employees and a sub-class of retirees. On April 20, 1999, petitioner's attorneysent a letter to the District Court informally seeking to in-tervene in the class action. On May 12, 1999, petitioner sentanother letter repeating this request. He did not, however,formally move to intervene at that time.Also in May, the Plan's trustees and the class representatives agreed on a settlement whereby the COLA benefitswould be eliminated in exchange for the addition of otherbenefits. On August 27, 1999, the trustees filed a motion forpreliminary approval of the settlement. On September 10,1999, petitioner formally moved to intervene pursuant toFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 24. On November 12, 1999,the District Court denied petitioner's intervention motion as"absolutely untimely." Scardelletti v. Debarr, 265 F. 3d 195,201 (CA4 2001). It then heard objections to the settlement,including those advanced by petitioner, and, concluding thatthe settlement was fair, approved it.

SCARDELLETTIOpinion of the CourtShortly thereafter, petitioner noted his appeal, challengingthe District Court's dismissal of his intervention motion aswell as its decision to approve the settlement. The Court ofAppeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the District Court'sdenial of intervention under an abuse of discretion standard.265 F. 3d, at 203-204. It further held that, because petitioner was not a named representative of the class and be-cause he had been properly denied the right to intervene, helacked standing to challenge the fairness of the settlementon appeal.Id., at 208-210.Petitioner sought review of the Fourth Circuit's holdingthat he lacked the ability to appeal the District Court's ap-proval of the settlement. We granted certiorari, 534 U. S.1064 (2001), to resolve a disagreement among the Circuits asto whether nonnamed class members who fail to properlyintervene may bring an appeal of the approval of a settle-ment. Compare Cook v. Powell Buick, Inc., 155 F. 3d 758,761 (CA5 1998) (holding that nonnamed class members whohave not successfully intervened may not appeal settlementapproval); Gottlieb v. Wiles, 11 F. 3d 1004, 1008-1009 (CA101993) (same);Guthrie v. Evans, 815 F. 2d 626, 628-629 (CA111987) (same); Shults v.

Ltd.Partnerships Litigation, 94 F. 3d 49, 53 (CA2 1996) (any nonnamed class member who objected at the fairness hearingmay appeal); Carlough v.

Holiday Magic, Inc., 550F. 2d 1173, 1176 (CA9 1977) (same).IIAlthough the Fourth Circuit framed the issue as one ofstanding, 265 F. 3d, at 204, we begin by clarifying that thisissue does not implicate the jurisdiction of the courts underArticle III of the Constitution. As a member of the retireeclass, petitioner has an interest in the settlement that createsa "case or controversy" sufficient to satisfy the constitutional536US1 Unit: $U57 [12-16-03 19:06:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN7Cite as: 536 U. S. 1 (2002)Opinion of the Courtrequirements of injury, causation, and redressability. Lujanv.Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555 (1992); see also In reNavigant Consulting, Inc., Securities Litigation, 275 F. 3d616, 620 (CA7 2001).Nor do appeals by nonnamed class members raise thesorts of concerns that are ordinarily addressed as a matterof prudential standing. Prudential standing requirementsinclude:"[T]he general prohibition on a litigant's raising anotherperson's legal rights, the rule barring adjudication ofgeneralized grievances more appropriately addressed inthe representative branches, and the requirement thata plaintiff 's complaint fall within the zone of interestsprotected by the law invoked." Allen v. Wright, 468U. S. 737, 751 (1984).Because petitioner is a member of the class bound by thejudgment, there is no question that he satisfies these threerequirements. The legal rights he seeks to raise are hisown, he belongs to a discrete class of interested parties, andhis complaint clearly falls within the zone of interests of therequirement that a settlement be fair to all class members.Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(e).What is at issue, instead, is whether petitioner should beconsidered a "party" for the purposes of appealing the ap-proval of the settlement. We have held that "only partiesto a lawsuit, or those that properly become parties, may ap-peal an adverse judgment."Marino v. Ortiz, 484 U. S. 301,304 (1988) (per curiam). Respondents argue that, becausepetitioner is not a named class representative and did notsuccessfully move to intervene, he is not a party for the purposes of taking an appeal.We have never, however, restricted the right to appeal tonamed parties to the litigation. In Blossom v. Milwaukee &Chicago R. Co., 1 Wall. 655 (1864), for instance, we alloweda bidder for property at a foreclosure sale, who was not a536US1 Unit: $U57 [12-16-03 19:06:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN8 DEVLIN v. SCARDELLETTIOpinion of the Courtnamed party in the foreclosure action, to appeal the refusalof a request he made during that action to compel the sale.In Hinckley v. Gilman, C., & S. R. Co., 94 U. S. 467 (1877),we allowed a receiver, who was an officer of the court ratherthan a named party to the case, to appeal from an order"relat[ing] to the settlement of his accounts," reasoning that"[f]or this purpose he occupies the position of a party tothe suit." Id., at 469. More recently, we have affirmed that"[t]he right of a nonparty to appeal an adjudication of contempt cannot be questioned," United States Catholic Conference v. Abortion Rights Mobilization, Inc., 487 U. S. 72, 76(1988), given the binding nature of that adjudication uponthe interested nonparty.Justice Scalia attempts to distinguish these cases bycharacterizing them as appeals from collateral orders towhich the appellants "were parties." Post, at 16 (dissentingopinion). But it is difficult to see how they were parties inthe sense in which Justice Scalia uses the term--those" `named as a party to an action,' " usually " `in the captionof the summons or complaint.' " Post, at 15 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments $ 34(1), p. 345 (1980); id.,Comment a, Reporter's Note, at 347). Because they werenot named in the action, the appellants in these cases wereparties only in the sense that they were bound by the orderfrom which they were seeking to appeal.Petitioner's interest in the District Court's approval of thesettlement is similar. Petitioner objected to the settlementat the District Court's fairness hearing, as nonnamed partieshave been consistently allowed to do under the FederalRules of Civil Procedure. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(e)("A class action shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court, and notice of the proposeddismissal or compromise shall be given to all members of theclass in such manner as the court directs"); see also 2 H.Newberg & A. Conte, Class Actions $ 11.55, p. 11-132 (3d ed.1992) (explaining that Rule 23(e) entitles all class members536US1 Unit: $U57 [12-16-03 19:06:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN9Cite as: 536 U. S. 1 (2002)Opinion of the Courtto an opportunity to object). The District Court's approvalof the settlement--which binds petitioner as a member ofthe class--amounted to a "final decision of [petitioner's] rightor claim" sufficient to trigger his right to appeal. SeeWilliams v. Morgan, 111 U. S. 684, 699 (1884) (describing thecases discussed above). And like the appellants in the priorcases, petitioner will only be allowed to appeal that aspectof the District Court's order that affects him--the DistrictCourt's decision to disregard his objections. Cf.supra, at 6.Petitioner's right to appeal this aspect of the District Court'sdecision cannot be effectively accomplished through thenamed class representative--once the named parties reacha settlement that is approved over petitioner's objections,petitioner's interests by definition diverge from those of theclass representative.Marino v. Ortiz, supra, is not to the contrary. In thatcase, we refused to allow an appeal of a settlement by agroup of white police officers who were not members of theclass of minority officers that had brought a racial discrimination claim against the New York Police Department. Although the settlement affected them, the District Court's decision did not finally dispose of any right or claim they mighthave had because they were not members of the class.Nor does considering nonnamed class members parties forthe purposes of bringing an appeal conflict with any otheraspect of class action procedure. In a related case, the Seventh Circuit has argued that nonnamed class members cannot be considered parties for the purposes of bringing anappeal because they are not considered parties for the purposes of the complete diversity requirement in suits under28 U. S. C. $ 1332. See Navigant Consulting, 275 F. 3d, at619; see also Snyder v. Harris, 394 U. S. 332, 340 (1969). According to the Seventh Circuit, "[c]lass members cannot haveit both ways, being non-parties (so that more cases can cometo federal court) but still having a party's ability to litigateindependently." 275 F. 3d, at 619. Nonnamed class mem536US1 Unit: $U57 [12-16-03 19:06:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN10 DEVLIN v. SCARDELLETTIOpinion of the Courtbers, however, may be parties for some purposes and notfor others. The label "party" does not indicate an absolutecharacteristic, but rather a conclusion about the applicabilityof various procedural rules that may differ based on context.Nonnamed class members are, for instance, parties in thesense that the filing of an action on behalf of the class tollsa statute of limitations against them. See American Pipe& Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538 (1974). Otherwise, allclass members would be forced to intervene to preserve theirclaims, and one of the major goals of class action litigation--to simplify litigation involving a large number of class members with similar claims--would be defeated. The rule thatnonnamed class members cannot defeat complete diversityis likewise justified by the goals of class action litigation.Ease of administration of class actions would be compromised by having to consider the citizenship of all class members, many of whom may even be unknown, in determiningjurisdiction. See 7A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 1755, pp. 63-64 (2d ed. 1986).Perhaps more importantly, considering all class members forthese purposes would destroy diversity in almost all classactions. Nonnamed class members are, therefore, not parties in that respect.What is most important to this case is that nonnamed classmembers are parties to the proceedings in the sense of beingbound by the settlement. It is this feature of class actionlitigation that requires that class members be allowed to appeal the approval of a settlement when they have objectedat the fairness hearing. To hold otherwise would deprivenonnamed class members of the power to preserve their owninterests in a settlement that will ultimately bind them, despite their expressed objections before the trial court. Particularly in light of the fact that petitioner had no ability toopt out of the settlement, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(1),appealing the approval of the settlement is petitioner's only536US1 Unit: $U57 [12-16-03 19:06:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN11Cite as: 536 U. S. 1 (2002)Opinion of the Courtmeans of protecting himself from being bound by a disposi-tion of his rights he finds unacceptable and that a reviewingcourt might find legally inadequate.Justice Scalia rightly notes that other nonnamed par-ties may be bound by a court's decision, in particular, thosein privity with the named party. See post, at 18. Trueenough. It is not at all clear, however, that such partiesmay not themselves appeal. Although this Court has neveraddressed the issue, nonnamed parties in privity with anamed party are often allowed by other courts to appealfrom the order that affects them. 5 Am. Jur. 2d, AppellateReview $ 265 (1995).Respondents argue that, nonetheless, appeals from nonnamed parties should not be allowed because they would un-dermine one of the goals of class action litigation, namely,preventing multiple suits. See Guthrie v. Evans, 815 F. 2d,at 629 (arguing that allowing nonnamed class members' appeals would undermine a "fundamental purpose of the classaction": "to render manageable litigation that involves numerous members of a homogenous class, who would all other-wise have access to the court through individual lawsuits").Allowing such appeals, however, will not be as problematicas respondents claim. For one thing, the power to appeal islimited to those nonnamed class members who have objectedduring the fairness hearing. This limits the class of potential appellants considerably. As the longstanding practice ofallowing nonnamed class members to object at the fairnesshearing demonstrates, the burden of considering the claimsof this subset of class members is not onerous.IIIThe Government, as amicus curiae, admits that nonnamedclass members are parties who may appeal the approval of asettlement, but urges us nonetheless to require class members to intervene for purposes of appeal. See Brief for536US1 Unit: $U57 [12-16-03 19:06:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN12 DEVLIN v. SCARDELLETTIOpinion of the CourtUnited States et al. as Amici Curiae 12-27. To address thefairness concerns to objecting nonnamed class membersbound by the settlement they wish to appeal, however, theGovernment also asserts that such a limited purpose intervention generally should be available to all those, like peti-tioner, whose objections at the fairness hearing have beendisregarded. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2) provides for intervention as of right:"Upon timely application . . . when the applicant claimsan interest relating to the property or transaction whichis the subject of the action and the applicant is so situ-ated that the disposition of the action may as a practicalmatter impair or impede the applicant's ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant's interest is ade-quately represented by existing parties."According to the Government, nonnamed class members whostate objections at the fairness hearing should easily meetthese three criteria. For one thing, it claims, a settlementbinding on them will establish the requisite interest in theaction. Moreover, it argues, any intervention motion filed"within the time period in which the named plaintiffs couldhave taken an appeal" should be considered "timely filed" forthe purposes of such limited intervention. United Airlines,Inc. v. McDonald, 432 U. S. 385, 396 (1977). Finally, it asserts, the approval of a settlement over a nonnamed classmember's objection, and the failure of a class representativeto appeal such an approval, should "invariably" show thatthe class representative does not adequately represent thenonnamed class member's interests on appeal. Brief forUnited States et al. as Amici Curiae 20.Given the ease with which nonnamed class members whohave objected at the fairness hearing could intervene forpurposes of appeal, however, it is difficult to see the value ofthe Government's suggested requirement. It identifies only536US1 Unit: $U57 [12-16-03 19:06:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN13Cite as: 536 U. S. 1 (2002)Opinion of the Courta limited number of instances where the initial interventionmotion would be of any use: where the objector is not actually a member of the settlement class or is otherwise notentitled to relief from the settlement, where an objectorseeks to appeal even though his objection was successful,where the objection at the fairness hearing was untimely, orwhere there is a need to consolidate duplicative appeals fromclass members. Id., at 23-25. In such situations, the Government argues, a district court can disallow such problematic and unnecessary appeals.This seems to us, however, of limited benefit. In the firsttwo of these situations, the objector stands to gain nothingby appeal, so it is unlikely such situations will arise with anyfrequency. Justice Scalia argues that if such objectorswere undeterred by this fact at the time they filed their original objections, they will be undeterred at the appellate level.See post, at 21-22. This misunderstands the point. As tothe first group--those who are not actually entitled to relief--one would not expect them to have filed objections inthe district court in the first place. The few irrational persons who wish to pursue one round of meaningless relief will,we agree, probably be irrational enough to pursue a second.But there should not be many of such persons in any case.As for the second--those whose objections were successfulat the district court level--they were far from irrational inthe filing of their initial objections, and they should not generally be expected to lose this level of sensibility when facedwith the prospect of a meaningless appeal. Moreover, evenif such cases did arise with any frequency, such concernscould be addressed by a standing inquiry at the appellatelevel.The third situation--dealing with untimely objections--implicates basic concerns about waiver and should be easilyaddressable by a court of appeals. A court of appeals alsohas the ability to avoid the fourth by consolidating cases rais536US1 Unit: $U57 [12-16-03 19:06:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN14 DEVLIN v. SCARDELLETTIOpinion of the Courting duplicative appeals. Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3(b)(2). Ifthe resolution of any of these issues should turn out to becomplex in a given case, there is little to be gained by requir-ing a district court to consider these issues, which are thetype of issues (standing to appeal, waiver of objections below,and consolidation of appeals) typically addressed only by anappellate court. As such determinations still would mostlikely lead to an appeal, such a requirement would only addan additional layer of complexity before the appeal of thesettlement approval may finally be heard.Nor do we agree with the Government that, regardless ofthe desirability of an intervention requirement for effectiveclass management, the structure of the rules of class actionprocedure requires intervention for the purposes of appeal.According to the Government, intervention is the methodcontemplated under the rules for nonnamed class membersto gain the right to participate in class action proceedings.We disagree. Just as class action procedure allows nonnamed class members to object to a settlement at the fair-ness hearing without first intervening, see supra, at 8-9, itshould similarly allow them to appeal the District Court'sdecision to disregard their objections. Moreover, no federalstatute or procedural rule directly addresses the question ofwho may appeal from approval of class action settlements,while the right to appeal from an action that finally disposesof one's rights has a statutory basis. 28 U. S. C. $ 1291.IVWe hold that nonnamed class members like petitioner whohave objected in a timely manner to approval of the settlement at the fairness hearing have the power to bring anappeal without first intervening. We therefore reverse thejudgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuitand remand the case for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.
