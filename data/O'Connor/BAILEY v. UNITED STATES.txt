IIn May 1989, petitioner Roland Bailey was stopped bypolice officers after they noticed that his car lacked a frontlicense plate and an inspection sticker. When Bailey failedto produce a driver's license, the officers ordered him out ofthe car. As he stepped out, the officers saw Bailey pushsomething between the seat and the front console. A searchof the passenger compartment revealed one round of ammu-nition and 27 plastic bags containing a total of 30 grams ofcocaine. After arresting Bailey, the officers searched thetrunk of his car where they found, among a number of items,a large amount of cash and a bag containing a loaded 9-mm.pistol.Bailey was charged on several counts, including using andcarrying a firearm in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1). Aprosecution expert testified at trial that drug dealers fre-quently carry a firearm to protect their drugs and money aswell as themselves. Bailey was convicted by the jury on allcharges, and his sentence included a consecutive 60-monthterm of imprisonment on the $ 924(c)(1) conviction.The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuitrejected Bailey's claim that the evidence was insufficient tosupport his conviction under $ 924(c)(1).United States v.Bailey, 995 F. 2d 1113 (CADC 1993). The court held thatBailey could be convicted for "using" a firearm during andin relation to a drug trafficking crime if the jury could reasonably infer that the gun facilitated Bailey's commission ofa drug offense.Id., at 1119. In Bailey's case, the court ex-plained, the trier of fact could reasonably infer that Baileyhad used the gun in the trunk to protect his drugs and drugproceeds and to facilitate sales. Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, dissenting in part, argued that prior Circuit precedentrequired reversal of Bailey's conviction.516us1$11J 10-22-98 11:07:25 PAGES OPINPGT140 BAILEY v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtIn June 1991, an undercover officer made a controlled buyof crack cocaine from petitioner Candisha Robinson. Theofficer observed Robinson retrieve the drugs from thebedroom of her one-bedroom apartment. After a secondcontrolled buy, the police executed a search warrant ofthe apartment. Inside a locked trunk in the bedroom closet,the police found, among other things, an unloaded, holstered.22-caliber Derringer, papers and a tax return belonging toRobinson, 10.88 grams of crack cocaine, and a marked $20bill from the first controlled buy.Robinson was indicted on a number of counts, includingusing or carrying a firearm in violation of $ 924(c)(1). Aprosecution expert testified that the Derringer was a "second gun," i. e., a type of gun a drug dealer might hide on hisor her person for use until reaching a "real gun." The expert also testified that drug dealers generally use guns toprotect themselves from other dealers, the police, and theirown employees. Robinson was convicted on all counts, including the $ 924(c)(1) count, for which she received a 60-month term of imprisonment. The District Court deniedRobinson's motion for a judgment of acquittal with respectto the "using or carrying" conviction and ruled that the evidence was sufficient to establish a violation of $ 924(c)(1).A divided panel of the Court of Appeals reversed Robinson's conviction on the $ 924(c)(1) count. United States v.Robinson, 997 F. 2d 884 (CADC 1993). The court determined, "[g]iven the way section 924(c)(1) is drafted, even ifan individual intends to use a firearm in connection with adrug trafficking offense, the conduct of that individual is notreached by the statute unless the individual actually uses thefirearm for that purpose." Id., at 887. The court held thatRobinson's possession of an unloaded .22-caliber Derringerin a locked trunk in a bedroom closet fell significantly shortof the type of evidence the court had previously held necessary to establish actual use under $ 924(c)(1). The mereproximity of the gun to the drugs was held insufficient to516us1$11J 10-22-98 11:07:25 PAGES OPINPGT141Cite as: 516 U. S. 137 (1995)Opinion of the Courtsupport the conviction. Judge Henderson dissented, ar-guing, among other things, that the firearm facilitated Robinson's distribution of drugs because it protected Robinsonand the drugs during sales.In order to resolve the apparent inconsistencies in its decisions applying $ 924(c)(1), the Court of Appeals for the Dis-trict of Columbia Circuit consolidated the two cases and reheard them en banc. In a divided opinion, a majority of thecourt held that the evidence was sufficient to establish thateach defendant had used a firearm in relation to a drug traf-ficking offense and affirmed the $ 924(c)(1) conviction in eachcase. 36 F. 3d 106 (CADC 1994) (en banc).The majority rejected a multifactor weighing approach todetermine sufficiency of the evidence to support a $ 924(c)(1)conviction. The District of Columbia Circuit had previouslyapplied a nonexclusive set of factors, including: accessibilityof the gun, its proximity to drugs, whether or not it wasloaded, what type of weapon was involved, and whether expert testimony supported the Government's theory of "use."The majority explained that this approach invited the reviewing court to reweigh the evidence and make its ownfinding with respect to an ultimate fact, a function properlyleft to the jury; had produced widely divergent and contradictory results; and was out of step with the broader definition of "use" employed by other Circuits.The court replaced the multifactor test with an "accessibility and proximity" test. "[W]e hold that one uses a gun, i. e.,avails oneself of a gun, and therefore violates [$ 924(c)(1)],whenever one puts or keeps the gun in a particular placefrom which one (or one's agent) can gain access to it if andwhen needed to facilitate a drug crime." Id., at 115. Thecourt applied this new standard and affirmed the convictionsof both Bailey and Robinson. In both cases, the court determined that the gun was sufficiently accessible and proximateto the drugs or drug proceeds that the jury could properlyinfer that the defendant had placed the gun in order to fur516us1$11J 10-22-98 11:07:25 PAGES OPINPGT142 BAILEY v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtther the drug offenses or to protect the possession of thedrugs.Judge Wald, in dissent, argued that the court's previousmultifactor test provided a better standard for appellatereview of $ 924(c)(1) convictions. Judge Williams, joinedby Judges Silberman and Buckley, also dissented. Heexplained his understanding that "use" under $ 924(c)(1)denoted active employment of the firearm "rather than possession with a contingent intent to use." Id., at 121. "[B]yarticulating a `proximity' plus `accessibility' test, however,the court has in effect diluted `use' to mean simply possessionwith a floating intent to use."Ibid.As the debate within the District of Columbia Circuit illustrates, $ 924(c)(1) has been the source of much perplexity inthe courts. The Circuits are in conflict both in the standardsthey have articulated, compare United States v. TorresRodriguez, 930 F. 2d 1375, 1385 (CA9 1991) (mere possessionsufficient to satisfy $ 924(c)), with United States v. CastroLara, 970 F. 2d 976, 983 (CA1 1992) (mere possession insuffi-cient), cert. deniedsub nom. Sarraff v. United States, 508U. S. 962 (1993); and in the results they have reached, compare United States v. Feliz-Cordero, 859 F. 2d 250, 254 (CA21988) (presence of gun in dresser drawer in apartment withdrugs, drug proceeds, and paraphernalia insufficient to meet$ 924(c)(1)), with United States v. McFadden, 13 F. 3d 463,465 (CA1 1994) (evidence of gun hidden under mattress withmoney, near drugs, was sufficient to show "use"), andUnitedStates v. Hager, 969 F. 2d 883, 889 (CA10) (gun in boots inliving room near drugs was "used"), cert. denied, 506 U. S.964 (1992). We granted certiorari to clarify the meaning of"use" under $ 924(c)(1). 514 U. S. 1062 (1995).IISection 924(c)(1) requires the imposition of specified penal-ties if the defendant, "during and in relation to any crime ofviolence or drug trafficking crime . . . , uses or carries a516us1$11J 10-22-98 11:07:25 PAGES OPINPGT143Cite as: 516 U. S. 137 (1995)Opinion of the Courtfirearm." Petitioners argue that "use" signifies active em-ployment of a firearm. The Government opposes that definition and defends the proximity and accessibility testadopted by the Court of Appeals. We agree with petitioners, and hold that $ 924(c)(1) requires evidence sufficient toshow an active employment of the firearm by the defendant,a use that makes the firearm an operative factor in relationto the predicate offense.This action is not the first one in which the Court has grappled with the proper understanding of "use" in $ 924(c)(1).InSmith, we faced the question whether the barter of a gunfor drugs was a "use," and concluded that it was. Smith v.United States, 508 U. S. 223 (1993). As the debate in Smithillustrated, the word "use" poses some interpretational difficulties because of the different meanings attributable to it.Consider the paradoxical statement: "I use a gun to protectmy house, but I've never had to use it." "Use" draws meaning from its context, and we will look not only to the worditself, but also to the statute and the sentencing scheme, todetermine the meaning Congress intended.We agree with the majority below that "use" must connote more than mere possession of a firearm by a personwho commits a drug offense. See 36 F. 3d, at 109; accord,United States v. Castro-Lara, supra, at 983; United States v.Theodoropoulos, 866 F. 2d 587, 597-598 (CA3 1989); UnitedStates v. Wilson, 884 F. 2d 174, 177 (CA5 1989). Had Congress intended possession alone to trigger liability under$ 924(c)(1), it easily could have so provided. This obviousconclusion is supported by the frequent use of the term "possess" in the gun-crime statutes to describe prohibited gunrelated conduct. See, e. g., $$ 922(g), 922( j), 922(k), 922(o)(1),930(a), 930(b).Where the Court of Appeals erred was not in its conclusionthat "use" means more than mere possession, but in itsstandard for evaluating whether the involvement of a firearmamounted to something more than mere possession. Its516us1$11J 10-22-98 11:07:25 PAGES OPINPGT144 BAILEY v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtproximity and accessibility standard provides almost no limi-tation on the kind of possession that would be criminalized;in practice, nearly every possession of a firearm by a personengaged in drug trafficking would satisfy the standard,"thereby eras[ing] the line that the statutes, and the courts,have tried to draw." United States v. McFadden, supra, at469 (Breyer, C. J., dissenting). Rather than requiring actualuse, the District of Columbia Circuit would criminalize "sim-pl[e] possession with a floating intent to use." 36 F. 3d, at121 (Williams, J., dissenting). The shortcomings of this testare succinctly explained in Judge Williams' dissent:"While the majority attempts to fine-tune the conceptof facilitation (and thereby, use) through its twin guideposts of proximity and accessibility, the ultimate resultis that possession amounts to `use' because possessionenhances the defendant's confidence. Had Congress in-tended that, all it need have mentioned is possession.In this regard, the majority's test is either so broad asto assure automatic affirmance of any jury conviction or,if not so broad, is unlikely to produce a clear guideline."Id., at 124-125 (citations omitted).An evidentiary standard for finding "use" that is satisfied inalmost every case by evidence of mere possession does notadhere to the obvious congressional intent to require morethan possession to trigger the statute's application.This conclusion--that a conviction for "use" of a firearmunder $ 924(c)(1) requires more than a showing of mere pos-session--requires us to answer a more difficult question.What must the Government show, beyond mere possession,to establish "use" for the purposes of the statute? We conclude that the language, context, and history of $ 924(c)(1)indicate that the Government must show active employmentof the firearm.We start, as we must, with the language of the statute.See United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S.516us1$11J 10-22-98 11:07:25 PAGES OPINPGT145Cite as: 516 U. S. 137 (1995)Opinion of the Court235, 241 (1989). The word "use" in the statute must begiven its "ordinary or natural" meaning, a meaning variouslydefined as "[t]o convert to one's service," "to employ," "toavail oneself of," and "to carry out a purpose or action bymeans of." Smith, supra, at 228-229 (internal quotationmarks omitted) (citing Webster's New International Diction-ary of English Language 2806 (2d ed. 1949) and Black's LawDictionary 1541 (6th ed. 1990)). These various definitionsof "use" imply action and implementation. See alsoMcFadden, 13 F. 3d, at 467 (Breyer, C. J., dissenting) ("[T]heordinary meanings of the words `use and `carry' . . . connoteactivity beyond simple possession").We consider not only the bare meaning of the word butalso its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme." `[T]he meaning of statutory language, plain or not, dependson context.' " Brown v. Gardner, 513 U. S. 115, 118 (1994)(citing King v. St. Vincent's Hospital, 502 U. S. 215, 221(1991)). Looking past the word "use" itself, we read$ 924(c)(1) with the assumption that Congress intended eachof its terms to have meaning. "Judges should hesitate . . .to treat [as surplusage] statutory terms in any setting, andresistance should be heightened when the words describe anelement of a criminal offense." Ratzlaf v. United States,510 U. S. 135, 140-141 (1994). Here, Congress has specifiedtwo types of conduct with a firearm: "uses" or "carries."Under the Government's reading of $ 924(c)(1), "use" includes even the action of a defendant who puts a gun intoplace to protect drugs or to embolden himself. This readingis of such breadth that no role remains for "carry." TheGovernment admits that the meanings of "use" and "carry"converge under its interpretation, but maintains that thisoverlap is a product of the particular history of $ 924(c)(1).Therefore, the Government argues, the canon of constructionthat instructs that "a legislature is presumed to have usedno superfluous words," Platt v. Union Pacific R. Co., 99 U. S.48, 58 (1879), is inapplicable. Brief for United States 24-25.516us1$11J 10-22-98 11:07:25 PAGES OPINPGT146 BAILEY v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtWe disagree. Nothing here indicates that Congress, whenit provided these two terms, intended that they be understood to be redundant.We assume that Congress used two terms because it intended each term to have a particular, nonsuperfluous meaning. While a broad reading of "use" undermines virtuallyany function for "carry," a more limited, active interpretation of "use" preserves a meaningful role for "carries" as analternative basis for a charge. Under the interpretation weenunciate today, a firearm can be used without being carried,e. g., when an offender has a gun on display during a transaction, or barters with a firearm without handling it; anda firearm can be carried without being used, e. g., when anoffender keeps a gun hidden in his clothing throughout adrug transaction.This reading receives further support from the context of$ 924(c)(1). As we observed in Smith, "using a firearm"should not have a "different meaning in $ 924(c)(1) than itdoes in $ 924(d)." 508 U. S., at 235. See also United Sav.Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd.,484 U. S. 365, 371 (1988) ("A provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of thestatutory scheme"). Section 924(d)(1) provides for the forfeiture of any firearm that is "used" or "intended to be used"in certain crimes. In that provision, Congress recognized adistinction between firearms "used" in commission of a crimeand those "intended to be used," and provided for forfeitureof a weapon even before it had been "used." In $ 924(c)(1),however, liability attaches only to cases of actual use, notintended use, as when an offender places a firearm with theintent to use it later if necessary. The difference betweenthe two provisions demonstrates that, had Congress meantto broaden application of the statute beyond actual "use,"Congress could and would have so specified, as it did in$ 924(d)(1).516us1$11J 10-22-98 11:07:25 PAGES OPINPGT147Cite as: 516 U. S. 137 (1995)Opinion of the CourtThe amendment history of $ 924(c) casts further light onCongress' intended meaning. The original version, passedin 1968, read:"(c) Whoever--"(1) uses a firearm to commit any felony which maybe prosecuted in a court of the United States, or"(2) carries a firearm unlawfully during the commis-sion of any felony which may be prosecuted in a court ofthe United States,"shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for notless than one year nor more than 10 years." $ 102, 82Stat. 1224.The phrase "uses a firearm to commit" indicates that Con-gress originally intended to reach the situation where thefirearm was actively employed during commission of thecrime. This original language would not have stretched sofar as to cover a firearm that played no detectable role in thecrime's commission. For example, a defendant who stored agun in a nearby closet for retrieval in case the deal wentsour would not have "use[d] a firearm to commit" a crime.This version also shows that "use" and "carry" were employed with distinctly different meanings.Congress' 1984 amendment to $ 924(c) altered the scopeof predicate offenses from "any felony" to "any crime ofviolence," removed the "unlawfully" requirement, mergedthe "uses" and "carries" prongs, substituted "during andin relation to" the predicate crimes for the earlier provi-sions linking the firearm to the predicate crimes, and raisedthe minimum sentence to five years. $ 1005(a), 98 Stat.2138-2139. The Government argues that this amendmentstripped "uses" and "carries" of the qualifications ("to com-mit" and "unlawfully during") that originally gave them distinct meanings, so that the terms should now be understoodto overlap. Of course, in Smith we recognized that Con516us1$11J 10-22-98 11:07:25 PAGES OPINPGT148 BAILEY v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtgress' subsequent amendments to $ 924(c) employed "use" ex-pansively, to cover both use as a weapon and use as an itemof barter. See Smith, 508 U. S., at 236. But there is noevidence to indicate that Congress intended to expand themeaning of "use" so far as to swallow up any significance for"carry." If Congress had intended to deprive "use" of itsactive connotations, it could have simply substituted a moreappropriate term--"possession"--to cover the conduct itwished to reach.The Government nonetheless argues that our observationinSmith that "$ 924(c)(1)'s language sweeps broadly," 508U. S., at 229, precludes limiting "use" to active employment.But our decision today is not inconsistent with Smith. Although there we declined to limit "use" to the meaning "useas a weapon," our interpretation of $ 924(c)(1) nonethelessadhered to an active meaning of the term. In Smith, it wasclear that the defendant had "used" the gun; the questionwas whether that particular use (bartering) came within themeaning of $ 924(c)(1). Smith did not address the questionwe face today of what evidence is required to permit a juryto find that a firearm had been used at all.To illustrate the activities that fall within the definition of"use" provided here, we briefly describe some of the activities that fall within "active employment" of a firearm, andthose that do not.The active-employment understanding of "use" certainlyincludes brandishing, displaying, bartering, striking with,and, most obviously, firing or attempting to fire a firearm.We note that this reading compels the conclusion that evenan offender's reference to a firearm in his possession couldsatisfy $ 924(c)(1). Thus, a reference to a firearm calculatedto bring about a change in the circumstances of the predicateoffense is a "use," just as the silent but obvious and forcefulpresence of a gun on a table can be a "use."The example given above--"I use a gun to protect myhouse, but I've never had to use it"--shows that "use" takes516us1$11J 10-22-98 11:07:25 PAGES OPINPGT149Cite as: 516 U. S. 137 (1995)Opinion of the Courton different meanings depending on context. In the firstphrase of the example, "use" refers to an ongoing, inactivefunction fulfilled by a firearm. It is this sense of "use" thatunderlies the Government's contention that "placement forprotection"--i. e., placement of a firearm to provide a senseof security or to embolden--constitutes a "use." It follows,according to this argument, that a gun placed in a closet is"used," because its mere presence emboldens or protects itsowner. We disagree. Under this reading, mere possessionof a firearm by a drug offender, at or near the site of a drugcrime or its proceeds or paraphernalia, is a "use" by theoffender, because its availability for intimidation, attack, ordefense would always, presumably, embolden or comfort theoffender. But the inert presence of a firearm, without more,is not enough to trigger $ 924(c)(1). Perhaps the nonactivenature of this asserted "use" is clearer if a synonym is used:storage. A defendant cannot be charged under $ 924(c)(1)merely for storing a weapon near drugs or drug proceeds.Storage of a firearm, without its more active employment, isnot reasonably distinguishable from possession.A possibly more difficult question arises where an offenderconceals a gun nearby to be at the ready for an imminentconfrontation. Cf. 36 F. 3d, at 119 (Wald, J., dissenting) (discussing distinction between firearm's accessibility to drugsor drug proceeds and its accessibility to defendant). Somemight argue that the offender has "actively employed" thegun by hiding it where he can grab and use it if necessary.In our view, "use" cannot extend to encompass this action.If the gun is not disclosed or mentioned by the offender, itis not actively employed, and it is not "used." To concludeotherwise would distort the language of the statute as wellas create an impossible line-drawing problem. How "at theready" was the firearm? Within arm's reach? In the room?In the house? How long before the confrontation did heplace it there? Five minutes or 24 hours? Placement forlater active use does not constitute "use." An alternative516us1$11J 10-22-98 11:07:25 PAGES OPINPGT150 BAILEY v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtrationale for why "placement at the ready" is a "use"--that such placement is made with the intent to put the firearm to a future active use--also fails. As discussed above,$ 924(d)(1) demonstrates that Congress knew how to draft astatute to reach a firearm that was "intended to be used."In $ 924(c)(1), it chose not to include that term, but insteadestablished the 5-year mandatory minimum only for thosedefendants who actually "use" the firearm.While it is undeniable that the active-employment readingof "use" restricts the scope of $ 924(c)(1), the Governmentoften has other means available to charge offenders who mixguns and drugs. The "carry" prong of $ 924(c)(1), for example, brings some offenders who would not satisfy the "use"prong within the reach of the statute. And SentencingGuidelines $ 2D1.1(b)(1) provides an enhancement for a per-son convicted of certain drug-trafficking offenses if a firearmwas possessed during the offense. United States Sentenc-ing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 2D1.1(b)(1) (Nov. 1994).But the word "use" in $ 924(c)(1) cannot support the extendedapplications that prosecutors have sometimes placed on it, inorder to penalize drug-trafficking offenders for firearmspossession.The test set forth by the Court of Appeals renders "use"virtually synonymous with "possession" and makes any rolefor "carry" superfluous. The language of $ 924(c)(1), sup-ported by its history and context, compels the conclusionthat Congress intended "use" in the active sense of "to availoneself of." To sustain a conviction under the "use" prongof $ 924(c)(1), the Government must show that the defendantactively employed the firearm during and in relation to thepredicate crime. IIIHaving determined that "use" denotes active employment,we must conclude that the evidence was insufficient to support either Bailey's or Robinson's conviction for "use"under $ 924(c)(1).516us1$11J 10-22-98 11:07:25 PAGES OPINPGT151Cite as: 516 U. S. 137 (1995)Opinion of the CourtThe police stopped Bailey for a traffic offense and arrestedhim after finding cocaine in the driver's compartment of hiscar. The police then found a firearm inside a bag in thelocked car trunk. There was no evidence that Bailey actively employed the firearm in any way. In Robinson's case,the unloaded, holstered firearm that provided the basis forher $ 924(c)(1) conviction was found locked in a footlocker ina bedroom closet. No evidence showed that Robinson hadactively employed the firearm. We reverse both judgments.Bailey and Robinson were each charged under both the"use" and "carry" prongs of $ 924(c)(1). Because the Courtof Appeals did not consider liability under the "carry" prongof $ 924(c)(1) for Bailey or Robinson, we remand for consider-ation of that basis for upholding the convictions.
