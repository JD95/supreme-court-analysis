This case concerns the kind and amount of evidence neces-sary to sustain a jury's verdict that an employer unlawfullydiscriminated on the basis of age. Specifically, we mustresolve whether a defendant is entitled to judgment as amatter of law when the plaintiff 's case consists exclusivelyof a prima facie case of discrimination and sufficient evidencefor the trier of fact to disbelieve the defendant's legitimate,nondiscriminatory explanation for its action. We must alsodecide whether the employer was entitled to judgment as amatter of law under the particular circumstances presentedhere. IIn October 1995, petitioner Roger Reeves was 57 yearsold and had spent 40 years in the employ of respondent,Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., a manufacturer of toiletseats and covers. 197 F. 3d 688, 690 (CA5 1999). Petitionerworked in a department known as the "Hinge Room," wherehe supervised the "regular line." Ibid. Joe Oswalt, in hismid-thirties, supervised the Hinge Room's "special line,"and Russell Caldwell, the manager of the Hinge Room andage 45, supervised both petitioner and Oswalt. Ibid. Peti-tioner's responsibilities included recording the attendanceand hours of those under his supervision, and reviewing aweekly report that listed the hours worked by each employee. 3 Record 38-40.In the summer of 1995, Caldwell informed Powe Chesnut,the director of manufacturing and the husband of companypresident Sandra Sanderson, that "production was down" inley Strauss, Stephen A.

According to Chesnut's testimony, thatinvestigation revealed "numerous timekeeping errors andmisrepresentations on the part of Caldwell, Reeves, and Os-walt."Ibid. Following the audit, Chesnut, along withDana Jester, vice president of human resources, and TomWhitaker, vice president of operations, recommended tocompany president Sanderson that petitioner and Caldwellbe fired. Id., at 690-691. In October 1995, Sanderson followed the recommendation and discharged both petitionerand Caldwell. Id., at 691.In June 1996, petitioner filed suit in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, contending that he had been fired because of his age in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967(ADEA), 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 621 et seq.At trial, respondent contended that it had fired petitionerdue to his failure to maintain accurate attendance records,while petitioner attempted to demonstrate that respondent'sexplanation was pretext for age discrimination. 197 F. 3d,at 692-693. Petitioner introduced evidence that he had accurately recorded the attendance and hours of the employeesunder his supervision, and that Chesnut, whom Oswalt described as wielding "absolute power" within the company, 3Record 80, had demonstrated age-based animus in his dealings with petitioner. 197 F. 3d, at 693.During the trial, the District Court twice denied oral motions by respondent for judgment as a matter of law underRule 50 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the casewent to the jury. 3 Record 183; 4 id., at 354. The courtinstructed the jury that "[i]f the plaintiff fails to prove agewas a determinative or motivating factor in the decision to530US1 Unit: $U69 [10-22-01 18:15:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN139Cite as: 530 U.

So charged, the juryreturned a verdict in favor of petitioner, awarding him$35,000 in compensatory damages, and found that respondent's age discrimination had been "willfu[l]." 197 F. 3d, at691. The District Court accordingly entered judgment forpetitioner in the amount of $70,000, which included $35,000in liquidated damages based on the jury's finding of will-fulness.Ibid. Respondent then renewed its motion forjudgment as a matter of law and alternatively moved for anew trial, while petitioner moved for front pay. 2 Record,Doc. Nos. 36, 38. The District Court denied respondent'smotions and granted petitioner's, awarding him $28,490.80 infront pay for two years' lost income. 2 id., Doc. Nos. 40, 41.The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that petitioner had not introduced sufficient evidence tosustain the jury's finding of unlawful discrimination. 197 F.3d, at 694. After noting respondent's proffered justificationfor petitioner's discharge, the court acknowledged that petitioner "very well may" have offered sufficient evidence for"a reasonable jury [to] have found that [respondent's] explanation for its employment decision was pretextual." Id., at693. The court explained, however, that this was "not dispositive" of the ultimate issue--namely, "whether Reevespresented sufficient evidence that his age motivated [respondent's] employment decision." Ibid. Addressing thisquestion, the court weighed petitioner's additional evidenceof discrimination against other circumstances surroundinghis discharge. See id., at 693-694. Specifically, the courtnoted that Chesnut's age-based comments "were not madein the direct context of Reeves's termination"; there was noallegation that the two other individuals who had recommended that petitioner be fired (Jester and Whitaker) weremotivated by age; two of the decisionmakers involved inpetitioner's discharge (Jester and Sanderson) were over theage of 50; all three of the Hinge Room supervisors were530US1 Unit: $U69 [10-22-01 18:15:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN140 REEVES v.

Ibid. On this basis, thecourt concluded that petitioner had not introduced sufficientevidence for a rational jury to conclude that he had beendischarged because of his age. Id., at 694.We granted certiorari, 528 U. S. 985 (1999), to resolve aconflict among the Courts of Appeals as to whether a plaintiff 's prima facie case of discrimination (as defined in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792, 802 (1973)), combined with sufficient evidence for a reasonable factfinder toreject the employer's nondiscriminatory explanation for itsdecision, is adequate to sustain a finding of liability for intentional discrimination.

S. C. $ 623(a)(1).When a plaintiff alleges disparate treatment, "liability depends on whether the protected trait (under the ADEA, age)actually motivated the employer's decision."Hazen PaperCo. v. Biggins, 507 U. S. 604, 610 (1993). That is, the plaintiff 's age must have "actually played a role in [the employer'sdecisionmaking] process and had a determinative influenceon the outcome." Ibid. Recognizing that "the questionfacing triers of fact in discrimination cases is both sensitiveand difficult," and that "[t]here will seldom be `eyewitness'testimony as to the employer's mental processes," PostalService Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U. S. 711, 716 (1983),the Courts of Appeals, including the Fifth Circuit in thiscase, have employed some variant of the framework articu-lated in McDonnell Douglas to analyze ADEA claims thatare based principally on circumstantial evidence. See, e. g.,Stokes v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co., 206 F. 3d 420,429 (CA4 2000); Galabya v. New York City Bd. of Ed., 202F. 3d 636, 639 (CA2 2000); Hall v.

Diamond Shamrock Corp., 670 F. 2d 66, 69 (CA61982). This Court has not squarely addressed whether theMcDonnell Douglas framework, developed to assess claimsbrought under $ 703(a)(1) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Actof 1964, 78 Stat. 255, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1), also appliesto ADEA actions. Because the parties do not dispute theissue, we shall assume,arguendo, that the McDonnell Douglas framework is fully applicable here. Cf. O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp., 517 U. S. 308, 311 (1996).McDonnell Douglas and subsequent decisions have "established an allocation of the burden of production and anorder for the presentation of proof in . . . discriminatorytreatment cases." St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks, 509U. S. 502, 506 (1993). First, the plaintiff must establish aprima facie case of discrimination. Ibid.; Texas Dept. ofCommunity Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248, 252-253(1981). It is undisputed that petitioner satisfied this burdenhere: (i) at the time he was fired, he was a member of theclass protected by the ADEA ("individuals who are at least40 years of age," 29 U. S. C. $ 631(a)), (ii) he was otherwisequalified for the position of Hinge Room supervisor, (iii) hewas discharged by respondent, and (iv) respondent successively hired three persons in their thirties to fill petitioner'sposition. See 197 F. 3d, at 691-692. The burden thereforeshifted to respondent to "produc[e] evidence that the plaintiffwas rejected, or someone else was preferred, for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason." Burdine, supra, at 254.This burden is one of production, not persuasion; it "can involve no credibility assessment." St. Mary's Honor Center,supra, at 509. Respondent met this burden by offeringadmissible evidence sufficient for the trier of fact to conclude that petitioner was fired because of his failure to maintain accurate attendance records. See 197 F. 3d, at 692.Accordingly, "the McDonnell Douglas framework--with530US1 Unit: $U69 [10-22-01 18:15:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN143Cite as: 530 U. S. 133 (2000)Opinion of the Courtits presumptions and burdens"--disappeared, St. Mary'sHonor Center, supra, at 510, and the sole remaining issuewas "discrimination vel non," Aikens, supra, at 714.Although intermediate evidentiary burdens shift backand forth under this framework, "[t]he ultimate burden ofpersuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionallydiscriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times withthe plaintiff." Burdine, 450 U. S., at 253. And in attempt-ing to satisfy this burden, the plaintiff--once the employerproduces sufficient evidence to support a nondiscriminatoryexplanation for its decision--must be afforded the "opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that thelegitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its truereasons, but were a pretext for discrimination." Ibid.; seealso St. Mary's Honor Center, supra, at 507-508. That is,the plaintiff may attempt to establish that he was the victim of intentional discrimination "by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence."Burdine, supra, at 256. Moreover, although the presumption of discrimination "drops out of the picture" once the defendant meets its burden of production, St. Mary's HonorCenter, supra, at 511, the trier of fact may still consider theevidence establishing the plaintiff 's prima facie case "andinferences properly drawn therefrom . . . on the issue ofwhether the defendant's explanation is pretextual," Burdine,supra, at 255, n. 10.In this case, the evidence supporting respondent's explanation for petitioner's discharge consisted primarily oftestimony by Chesnut and Sanderson and documentationof petitioner's alleged "shoddy record keeping." 197 F. 3d,at 692. Chesnut testified that a 1993 audit of Hinge Roomoperations revealed "a very lax assembly line" where employees were not adhering to general work rules. 4 Record 197-199. As a result of that audit, petitioner was placedon 90 days' probation for unsatisfactory performance. 197F. 3d, at 690. In 1995, Chesnut ordered another investi530US1 Unit: $U69 [10-22-01 18:15:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN144 REEVES v. SANDERSON PLUMBING PRODUCTS, INC.Opinion of the Courtgation of the Hinge Room, which, according to his testi-mony, revealed that petitioner was not correctly recordingthe absences and hours of employees. 4 Record 204-205.Respondent introduced summaries of that investigationdocumenting several attendance violations by 12 employeesunder petitioner's supervision, and noting that each shouldhave been disciplined in some manner. See App. 21-24,30-37; 4 Record 206-208. Chesnut testified that this failureto discipline absent and late employees is "extremely important when you are dealing with a union" because unevenenforcement across departments would keep the company"in grievance and arbitration cases, which are costly, allthe time." 4 id., at 206. He and Sanderson also statedthat petitioner's errors, by failing to adjust for hours notworked, cost the company overpaid wages. 3 id., at 100,142, 154; 4 id., at 191-192, 213. Sanderson testified that sheaccepted the recommendation to discharge petitioner because he had "intentionally falsif[ied] company pay records."3 id., at 100.Petitioner, however, made a substantial showing that respondent's explanation was false. First, petitioner offeredevidence that he had properly maintained the attendancerecords. Most of the timekeeping errors cited by respondent involved employees who were not marked late but whowere recorded as having arrived at the plant at 7 a.m. forthe 7 a.m. shift. 3 id., at 118-123; 4 id., at 240-247, 283-285,291, 293-294. Respondent contended that employees arriving at 7 a.m. could not have been at their workstations by7 a.m., and therefore must have been late. 3 id., at 119-120;4 id., at 241, 245. But both petitioner and Oswalt testifiedthat the company's automated timeclock often failed toscan employees' timecards, so that the timesheets would notrecord any time of arrival. 3 id., at 6, 85; 4 id., at 334-335.On these occasions, petitioner and Oswalt would visuallycheck the workstations and record whether the employeeswere present at the start of the shift. 3 id., at 6, 85-87;530US1 Unit: $U69 [10-22-01 18:15:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN145Cite as: 530 U. S. 133 (2000)Opinion of the Court4 id., at 335. They stated that if an employee arrivedpromptly but the timesheet contained no time of arrival,they would reconcile the two by marking "7 a.m." as theemployee's arrival time, even if the employee actually arrived at the plant earlier. Ibid. On cross-examination,Chesnut acknowledged that the timeclock sometimes malfunctioned, and that if "people were there at their workstation[s]" at the start of the shift, the supervisor "wouldwrite in seven o'clock." 4id., at 244. Petitioner also testified that when employees arrived before or stayed after theirshifts, he would assign them additional work so they wouldnot be overpaid. See 197 F. 3d, at 693.Petitioner similarly cast doubt on whether he was responsible for any failure to discipline late and absent employees.Petitioner testified that his job only included reviewing thedaily and weekly attendance reports, and that disciplinarywriteups were based on the monthly reports, which werereviewed by Caldwell. 3 Record 20-22; 4 id., at 335. Sanderson admitted that Caldwell, and not petitioner, was responsible for citing employees for violations of the company's attendance policy. 3 id., at 20-21, 137-138. Further, Chesnutconceded that there had never been a union grievance oremployee complaint arising from petitioner's recordkeeping,and that the company had never calculated the amount ofoverpayments allegedly attributable to petitioner's errors.4 id., at 267, 301. Petitioner also testified that, on the dayhe was fired, Chesnut said that his discharge was due to hisfailure to report as absent one employee, Gina Mae Coley, ontwo days in September 1995. 3 id., at 23, 70; 4 id., at 335-336. But petitioner explained that he had spent those daysin the hospital, and that Caldwell was therefore responsiblefor any overpayment of Coley. 3 id., at 17, 22. Finally,petitioner stated that on previous occasions that employeeswere paid for hours they had not worked, the company hadsimply adjusted those employees' next paychecks to correctthe errors. 3 id., at 72-73.530US1 Unit: $U69 [10-22-01 18:15:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN146 REEVES v. SANDERSON PLUMBING PRODUCTS, INC.Opinion of the CourtBased on this evidence, the Court of Appeals concludedthat petitioner "very well may be correct" that "a reasonablejury could have found that [respondent's] explanation for itsemployment decision was pretextual." 197 F. 3d, at 693.Nonetheless, the court held that this showing, standingalone, was insufficient to sustain the jury's finding of liability:"We must, as an essential final step, determine whetherReeves presented sufficient evidence that his age motivated[respondent's] employment decision."Ibid. And in makingthis determination, the Court of Appeals ignored the evi-dence supporting petitioner's prima facie case and challenging respondent's explanation for its decision. See id., at693-694. The court confined its review of evidence favoringpetitioner to that evidence showing that Chesnut had directed derogatory, age-based comments at petitioner, andthat Chesnut had singled out petitioner for harsher treatment than younger employees. See ibid. It is thereforeapparent that the court believed that only this additional evidence of discrimination was relevant to whether the jury'sverdict should stand. That is, the Court of Appeals proceeded from the assumption that a prima facie case of discrimination, combined with sufficient evidence for the trierof fact to disbelieve the defendant's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision, is insufficient as a matter oflaw to sustain a jury's finding of intentional discrimination.In so reasoning, the Court of Appeals misconceived theevidentiary burden borne by plaintiffs who attempt to proveintentional discrimination through indirect evidence. Thismuch is evident from our decision in St. Mary's Honor Center. There we held that the factfinder's rejection of theemployer's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action does not compel judgment for the plaintiff. 509 U. S.,at 511. The ultimate question is whether the employer intentionally discriminated, and proof that "the employer'sproffered reason is unpersuasive, or even obviously contrived, does not necessarily establish that the plaintiff 's prof530US1 Unit: $U69 [10-22-01 18:15:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN147Cite as: 530 U. S. 133 (2000)Opinion of the Courtfered reason . . . is correct." Id., at 524. In other words,"[i]t is not enough . . . todisbelieve the employer; the factfinder must believe the plaintiff 's explanation of intentionaldiscrimination."Id., at 519.In reaching this conclusion, however, we reasoned that itispermissible for the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact ofdiscrimination from the falsity of the employer's explanation.Specifically, we stated:"The factfinder's disbelief of the reasons put forward bythe defendant (particularly if disbelief is accompaniedby a suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the ele-ments of the prima facie case, suffice to show intentionaldiscrimination. Thus, rejection of the defendant's proffered reasons will permit the trier of fact to infer theultimate fact of intentional discrimination."Id., at 511.Proof that the defendant's explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form of circumstantial evidence that isprobative of intentional discrimination, and it may be quitepersuasive. See id., at 517 ("[P]roving the employer's rea-son false becomes part of (and often considerably assists) thegreater enterprise of proving that the real reason was intentional discrimination"). In appropriate circumstances,the trier of fact can reasonably infer from the falsity of theexplanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up adiscriminatory purpose. Such an inference is consistentwith the general principle of evidence law that the factfinderis entitled to consider a party's dishonesty about a materialfact as "affirmative evidence of guilt." Wright v. West, 505U. S. 277, 296 (1992); see alsoWilson v. United States, 162U. S. 613, 620-621 (1896); 2 J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 278(2),p. 133 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1979). Moreover, once the employer's justification has been eliminated, discrimination maywell be the most likely alternative explanation, especiallysince the employer is in the best position to put forth theactual reason for its decision. Cf. Furnco Constr. Corp. v.530US1 Unit: $U69 [10-22-01 18:15:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN148 REEVES v. SANDERSON PLUMBING PRODUCTS, INC.Opinion of the CourtWaters, 438 U. S. 567, 577 (1978) ("[W]hen all legitimatereasons for rejecting an applicant have been eliminated aspossible reasons for the employer's actions, it is more likelythan not the employer, who we generally assume acts withsome reason, based his decision on an impermissible con-sideration"). Thus, a plaintiff 's prima facie case, combinedwith sufficient evidence to find that the employer's assertedjustification is false, may permit the trier of fact to concludethat the employer unlawfully discriminated.This is not to say that such a showing by the plaintiff willalways be adequate to sustain a jury's finding of liability.Certainly there will be instances where, although the plaintiff has established a prima facie case and set forth sufficientevidence to reject the defendant's explanation, no rationalfactfinder could conclude that the action was discriminatory.For instance, an employer would be entitled to judgment asa matter of law if the record conclusively revealed someother, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer's decision,or if the plaintiff created only a weak issue of fact as towhether the employer's reason was untrue and there wasabundant and uncontroverted independent evidence thatno discrimination had occurred. See Aka v. WashingtonHospital Center, 156 F. 3d, at 1291-1292; see also Fisher v.Vassar College, 114 F. 3d, at 1338 ("[I]f the circumstancesshow that the defendant gave the false explanation to conceal something other than discrimination, the inference ofdiscrimination will be weak or nonexistent"). To holdotherwise would be effectively to insulate an entire category of employment discrimination cases from review underRule 50, and we have reiterated that trial courts should not" `treat discrimination differently from other ultimate questions of fact.' " St. Mary's Honor Center, supra, at 524(quoting Aikens, 460 U. S., at 716).Whether judgment as a matter of law is appropriate inany particular case will depend on a number of factors.Those include the strength of the plaintiff 's prima facie530US1 Unit: $U69 [10-22-01 18:15:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN149Cite as: 530 U. S. 133 (2000)Opinion of the Courtcase, the probative value of the proof that the employer'sexplanation is false, and any other evidence that supportsthe employer's case and that properly may be considered ona motion for judgment as a matter of law. See infra, at151-152. For purposes of this case, we need not--and couldnot--resolve all of the circumstances in which such factors would entitle an employer to judgment as a matter oflaw. It suffices to say that, because a prima facie case andsufficient evidence to reject the employer's explanation maypermit a finding of liability, the Court of Appeals erred inproceeding from the premise that a plaintiff must always in-troduce additional, independent evidence of discrimination.IIIAThe remaining question is whether, despite the Court ofAppeals' misconception of petitioner's evidentiary burden,respondent was nonetheless entitled to judgment as a matterof law. Under Rule 50, a court should render judgment asa matter of law when "a party has been fully heard on anissue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for areasonable jury to find for that party on that issue." Fed.Rule Civ. Proc. 50(a); see also Weisgram v. Marley Co., 528U. S. 440, 447-448 (2000). The Courts of Appeals have artic-ulated differing formulations as to what evidence a courtis to consider in ruling on a Rule 50 motion. See VentureTechnology, Inc. v. National Fuel Gas Distribution Corp.,decided with Schwimmer v. Sony Corp. of America, 459 U. S.1007, 1009 (1982) (White, J., dissenting from denial of certio-rari). Some decisions have stated that review is limited tothat evidence favorable to the nonmoving party, see, e. g.,Aparicio v. Norfolk & Western R. Co., 84 F. 3d 803, 807 (CA61996); Simpson v. Skelly Oil Co., 371 F. 2d 563, 566 (CA81967), while most have held that review extends to the entirerecord, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-movant, see,e. g., Tate v. Government Employees Ins. Co.,530US1 Unit: $U69 [10-22-01 18:15:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN150 REEVES v. SANDERSON PLUMBING PRODUCTS, INC.Opinion of the Court997 F. 2d 1433, 1436 (CA11 1993); Boeing Co. v. Shipman, 411F. 2d 365, 374 (CA5 1969) (en banc).On closer examination, this conflict seems more semanticthan real. Those decisions holding that review under Rule50 should be limited to evidence favorable to the nonmovantappear to have their genesis inWilkerson v. McCarthy, 336U. S. 53 (1949). See 9A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2529, pp. 297-301 (2d ed. 1995) (here-inafter Wright & Miller). InWilkerson, we stated that "inpassing upon whether there is sufficient evidence to submitan issue to the jury we need look only to the evidence andreasonable inferences which tend to support the case of " thenonmoving party. 336 U. S., at 57. But subsequent decisions have clarified that this passage was referring to theevidence to which the trial court should give credence, notthe evidence that the court should review. In the analogouscontext of summary judgment under Rule 56, we have statedthat the court must review the record "taken as a whole."Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475U. S. 574, 587 (1986). And the standard for granting summary judgment "mirrors" the standard for judgment as amatter of law, such that "the inquiry under each is the same."Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S. 242, 250-251(1986); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U. S. 317, 323(1986). It therefore follows that, in entertaining a motionfor judgment as a matter of law, the court should review allof the evidence in the record.In doing so, however, the court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, and it maynot make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.Lytle v. Household Mfg., Inc., 494 U. S. 545, 554-555 (1990);Liberty Lobby, Inc., supra, at 254; Continental Ore Co. v.Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U. S. 690, 696, n. 6(1962). "Credibility determinations, the weighing of theevidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from thefacts are jury functions, not those of a judge."

Thus, although the court should re-view the record as a whole, it must disregard all evidencefavorable to the moving party that the jury is not requiredto believe. See Wright & Miller 299. That is, the courtshould give credence to the evidence favoring the nonmovantas well as that "evidence supporting the moving party thatis uncontradicted and unimpeached, at least to the extentthat that evidence comes from disinterested witnesses."Id., at 300. BApplying this standard here, it is apparent that respond-ent was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Inthis case, in addition to establishing a prima facie case ofdiscrimination and creating a jury issue as to the falsityof the employer's explanation, petitioner introduced addi-tional evidence that Chesnut was motivated by age-basedanimus and was principally responsible for petitioner's firing.Petitioner testified that Chesnut had told him that he "wasso old [he] must have come over on the Mayflower" and,on one occasion when petitioner was having difficulty starting a machine, that he "was too damn old to do [his] job."3 Record 26. According to petitioner, Chesnut would regularly "cuss at me and shake his finger in my face." 3 id., at26-27. Oswalt, roughly 24 years younger than petitioner,corroborated that there was an "obvious difference" inhow Chesnut treated them. 3 id., at 82. He stated that,although he and Chesnut "had [their] differences," "it wasnothing compared to the way [Chesnut] treated Roger."Ibid. Oswalt explained that Chesnut "tolerated quite a bit"from him even though he "defied" Chesnut "quite often," butthat Chesnut treated petitioner "[i]n a manner, as youwould . . . treat . . . a child when . . . you're angry with [him]."3 id., at 82-83. Petitioner also demonstrated that, accordingto company records, he and Oswalt had nearly identical ratesof productivity in 1993. 3 id., at 163-167; 4 id., at 225-226.Yet respondent conducted an efficiency study of only the530US1 Unit: $U69 [10-22-01 18:15:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN152 REEVES v. SANDERSON PLUMBING PRODUCTS, INC.Opinion of the Courtregular line, supervised by petitioner, and placed only peti-tioner on probation. 3id., at 166-167; 4 id., at 229. Chesnut conducted that efficiency study and, after having testi-fied to the contrary on direct examination, acknowledged oncross-examination that he had recommended that petitionerbe placed on probation following the study. 4id., at 197-199, 237.Further, petitioner introduced evidence that Chesnutwas the actual decisionmaker behind his firing. Chesnutwas married to Sanderson, who made the formal decisionto discharge petitioner. 3id., at 90, 152. Although Sanderson testified that she fired petitioner because he had "intentionally falsif[ied] company pay records," 3 id., at 100,respondent only introduced evidence concerning the inaccuracy of the records, not their falsification. A 1994 letterauthored by Chesnut indicated that he berated other company directors, who were supposedly his coequals, about howto do their jobs. Pl. Exh. 7, 3 Record 108-112. Moreover,Oswalt testified that all of respondent's employees fearedChesnut, and that Chesnut had exercised "absolute power"within the company for "[a]s long as [he] can remember." 3id., at 80.In holding that the record contained insufficient evidenceto sustain the jury's verdict, the Court of Appeals misappliedthe standard of review dictated by Rule 50. Again, thecourt disregarded critical evidence favorable to petitioner--namely, the evidence supporting petitioner's prima faciecase and undermining respondent's nondiscriminatory explanation. See 197 F. 3d, at 693-694. The court also failed todraw all reasonable inferences in favor of petitioner. Forinstance, while acknowledging "the potentially damningnature" of Chesnut's age-related comments, the court discounted them on the ground that they "were not made in thedirect context of Reeves's termination." Id., at 693. Andthe court discredited petitioner's evidence that Chesnut wasthe actual decisionmaker by giving weight to the fact that530US1 Unit: $U69 [10-22-01 18:15:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN153Cite as: 530 U. S. 133 (2000)Opinion of the Courtthere was "no evidence to suggest that any of the other deci-sion makers were motivated by age."Id., at 694. Moreover, the other evidence on which the court relied--thatCaldwell and Oswalt were also cited for poor recordkeeping,and that respondent employed many managers over age 50--although relevant, is certainly not dispositive. SeeFurnco,438 U. S., at 580 (evidence that employer's work force wasracially balanced, while "not wholly irrelevant," was not"sufficient toconclusively demonstrate that [the employer's]actions were not discriminatorily motivated"). In conclud-ing that these circumstances so overwhelmed the evidencefavoring petitioner that no rational trier of fact could havefound that petitioner was fired because of his age, the Courtof Appeals impermissibly substituted its judgment concerning the weight of the evidence for the jury's.The ultimate question in every employment discriminationcase involving a claim of disparate treatment is whether theplaintiff was the victim of intentional discrimination. Giventhe evidence in the record supporting petitioner, we seeno reason to subject the parties to an additional round oflitigation before the Court of Appeals rather than to resolve the matter here. The District Court plainly informedthe jury that petitioner was required to show "by a preponderance of the evidence that his age was a determiningand motivating factor in the decision of [respondent] to terminate him." Tr. 7 (Jury Charge) (Sept. 12, 1997). Thecourt instructed the jury that, to show that respondent'sexplanation was a pretext for discrimination, petitionerhad to demonstrate "1, that the stated reasons were not thereal reasons for [petitioner's] discharge; and 2, that age discrimination was the real reason for [petitioner's] discharge."Ibid. (emphasis added). Given that petitioner established aprima facie case of discrimination, introduced enough evidence for the jury to reject respondent's explanation, andproduced additional evidence of age-based animus, there wassufficient evidence for the jury to find that respondent had530US1 Unit: $U69 [10-22-01 18:15:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN154 REEVES v. SANDERSON PLUMBING PRODUCTS, INC.Ginsburg, J., concurringintentionally discriminated. The District Court was there-fore correct to submit the case to the jury, and the Courtof Appeals erred in overturning its verdict.For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appealsis reversed.
