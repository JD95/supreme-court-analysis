This case presents the question whether the Double Jeop-ardy Clause, which we have found applicable in the capitalsentencing context, see Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U. S. 430(1981), extends to noncapital sentencing proceedings. Wehold that it does not, and accordingly affirm the judgment ofthe California Supreme Court.IPetitioner was charged under California law with onecount of using a minor to sell marijuana, Cal. Health & SafetyCode Ann. $ 11361(a) (West 1991), one count of sale or trans-portation of marijuana, $ 11360(a), and one count of possession of marijuana for sale, $ 11359. In the information, theState also notified petitioner that it would seek to prove twosentence enhancement allegations: that petitioner had pre-viously been convicted of assault and that he had served aprison term for that offense, see Cal. Penal Code Ann.$$ 245(a)(1), 667(e)(1), and 667.5 (West Supp. 1998).Under California's "three-strikes" law, a defendant con-victed of a felony who has two qualifying prior convictionsfor "serious felonies" receives a minimum sentence of 25years to life; when the instant conviction was preceded byone serious felony offense, the court doubles a defendant'sterm of imprisonment. $$ 667(d)(1) and (e)(1)-(2).

S. 721 (1998)Opinion of the Courtsonally used a dangerous or deadly weapon during the as-sault. $$ 1192.7(c)(8) and (23). According to California law,a number of procedural safeguards surround the assessmentof prior conviction allegations: Defendants may invoke theright to a jury trial, the right to confront witnesses, and theprivilege against self-incrimination; the prosecution mustprove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt; and therules of evidence apply. See, e. g., 16 Cal. 4th 826, 833-834,941 P. 2d 1121, 1126 (1997).Here, petitioner waived his right to a jury trial on thesentencing issues, and the court granted his motion to bifurcate the proceedings. After a jury entered a guilty verdicton the substantive offenses, the truth of the prior convictionallegations was argued before the court. The prosecutor asserted that petitioner had personally used a stick in committing the assault, see Tr. 189-190 (June 12, 1995), App. 12, butintroduced into evidence only a prison record demonstratingthat petitioner had been convicted of assault with a deadlyweapon and had served a prison term for the offense, seePeople's Exh. 1 (filed June 12, 1995), App. 3-6. The trialcourt found both sentencing allegations true and imposed an11-year term of imprisonment: 5 years on count one, doubledto 10 under the three-strikes law, and a 1-year enhancementfor the prior prison term. The court also stayed a 3-yearsentence on count 2 and ordered the 2-year sentence on count3 to be served concurrently.Petitioner appealed, and the California Court of Appeal,on its own motion, requested briefing as to whether sufficientevidence supported the finding that petitioner had a qualifying prior conviction. The State conceded that the record ofthe sentencing proceedings did not contain proof beyond areasonable doubt that petitioner had personally inflictedgreat bodily injury or used a deadly weapon, but requestedanother opportunity to prove the allegations on remand.See Respondent's Supplemental Brief (Cal. App.), pp. 2-3,App. 33-35. The court, however, determined both that the524US2 Unit: $U98 [09-06-00 19:40:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN726 MONGE v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtevidence was insufficient to trigger the sentence enhance-ment and that a remand for retrial on the allegation wouldviolate double jeopardy principles.The California Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeal's ruling that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrialof prior conviction allegations. The three-justice pluralitynoted this Court's traditional reluctance to apply doublejeopardy principles to sentencing proceedings and concludedthat the exception recognized inBullington, supra, did notapply. In Bullington, we held that a capital defendant whohad received a life sentence during a penalty phase that bore"the hallmarks of [a] trial on guilt or innocence" could not beresentenced to death upon retrial following appeal. Here,the plurality acknowledged that California's proceedings toassess the truth of prior conviction allegations have the hallmarks of a trial, but it found Bullington distinguishable onseveral grounds. First, the plurality cited statements bythis Court indicating that Bullington's rationale is confinedto the unique circumstances of capital cases. See 16 Cal.4th, at 836-837, 941 P. 2d, at 1128 (citing Caspari v. Bohlen,510 U. S. 383, 392 (1994); Pennsylvania v. Goldhammer, 474U. S. 28, 30 (1985) (per curiam)). The plurality also reasoned that capital sentencing procedures are mandated bythe Supreme Court's interpretation of the Federal Constitution, whereas the procedural protections accorded in California's sentence enhancement proceedings rest on statutorygrounds. 16 Cal. 4th, at 837, 941 P. 2d, at 1128. The plurality then cited the breadth and subjectivity of the factual determinations at issue in the capital sentencing context, aswell as the financial and emotional burden that the penaltyphase of a capital case places on a defendant. Id., at 838-839, 941 P. 2d, at 1129. Finally, the plurality explained thata qualifying strike involves a finding of a particular "status"that may be made from the record of the prior conviction,while the jury's sentencing determination in a capital case"depends on the specific facts of the defendant's present524US2 Unit: $U98 [09-06-00 19:40:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN727Cite as: 524 U. S. 721 (1998)Opinion of the Courtcrime, as well as an overall assessment of the defendant'scharacter." Id., at 839, 941 P. 2d, at 1130.The concurring justice who provided the fourth vote toreverse noted that retrial on a prior conviction allegationwould not require the factfinder to reevaluate the evidenceunderlying the substantive offense. Accordingly, she concluded that a second attempt at proving the allegation wouldnot unfairly subject a defendant to the risk of repeatedprosecution within the meaning of the Double JeopardyClause.Id., at 846-847, 941 P. 2d, at 1134-1135 (Brown,J., concurring). Three justices dissented, asserting thatunder Bullington's rationale, the Double Jeopardy Clauseprecludes successive efforts to prove prior conviction allegations. Id., at 847, 941 P. 2d, at 1135 (opinion of Wer-degar, J.).The California Supreme Court's decision deepened a con-flict among the state courts as toBullington's application tononcapital sentencing. Compare, e. g., State v. Hennings,100 Wash. 2d 379, 670 P. 2d 256 (1983), with People v. Levin,157 Ill. 2d 138, 623 N. E. 2d 317 (1993). Prior to this Court'sdetermination that the nonretroactivity rule of Teague v.Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), would bar the extension of Bull-ington to noncapital sentencing proceedings on federal habeas review, see Caspari, supra, the Federal Courts of Ap-peals had reached disparate conclusions as well. Compare,e. g., Briggs v. Procunier, 764 F. 2d 368, 371 (CA5 1985), withDenton v. Duckworth, 873 F. 2d 144 (CA7), cert. denied, 493U. S. 941 (1989). In view of the conflicting authority on theissue, we granted certiorari, 522 U. S. 1072 (1998).IIThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, ap-plicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment,provides: "[N]or shall any person be subject for the sameoffence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb." We havepreviously held that it protects against successive prosecu524US2 Unit: $U98 [09-06-00 19:40:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN728 MONGE v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courttions for the same offense after acquittal or conviction andagainst multiple criminal punishments for the same offense.See North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 717 (1969).Historically, we have found double jeopardy protections inapplicable to sentencing proceedings, see Bullington, 451U. S., at 438, because the determinations at issue do not placea defendant in jeopardy for an "offense," see,e. g., Nichols v.United States, 511 U. S. 738, 747 (1994) (noting that repeat-offender laws " `penaliz[e] only the last offense committed bythe defendant' "). Nor have sentence enhancements beenconstrued as additional punishment for the previous offense;rather, they act to increase a sentence "because of the manner in which [the defendant] committed the crime of conviction." United States v. Watts, 519 U. S. 148, 154 (1997)(per curiam); see also Witte v. United States, 515 U. S. 389,398 - 399 (1995). An enhanced sentence imposed on apersistent offender thus "is not to be viewed as either a newjeopardy or additional penalty for the earlier crimes" but as"a stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is consideredto be an aggravated offense because a repetitive one."Gryger v. Burke, 334 U. S. 728, 732 (1948); cf. Moore v. Missouri, 159 U. S. 673, 678 (1895) ("[T]he State may undoubtedly provide that persons who have been before convicted ofcrime may suffer severer punishment for subsequent offences than for a first offence").Justice Scalia insists that the recidivism enhancementthe Court confronts here in fact constitutes an element ofpetitioner's offense. His dissent addresses an issue that wasneither considered by the state courts nor discussed in petitioner's brief before this Court. In any event, JusticeScalia acknowledges, post, at 741, that his argument issquarely foreclosed by our decision in Almendarez-Torres v.United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998). One could imagine circumstances in which fundamental fairness would requirethat a particular fact be treated as an element of the offense,see post, at 738 (Scalia, J., dissenting), but there are also524US2 Unit: $U98 [09-06-00 19:40:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN729Cite as: 524 U. S. 721 (1998)Opinion of the Courtcases in which fairness calls for defining a fact as a sentenc-ing factor. A defendant might not, for example, wish to simultaneously profess his innocence of a drug offense and dis-pute the amount of drugs allegedly involved. Cf.Gregg v.Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 190-195 (1976) ( joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) (discussing the benefits ofbifurcated proceedings in capital cases). In part for thatreason, the Court has rejected an absolute rule that anenhancement constitutes an element of the offense any timethat it increases the maximum sentence to which a defendantis exposed. SeeAlmendarez-Torres, supra. Under California law, the maximum sentence applicable to a first offender who uses a minor to sell drugs is 7 years, and a judgemay double that sentence to 14 years where the offender haspreviously been convicted of a qualifying felony. See Cal.Health & Safety Code Ann. $ 11361(a) (West 1991). That increase falls well within the range that the Court has foundto be constitutionally permissible. See Almendarez-Torres,supra (upholding a potential 18-year increase to a 2-yearsentence). Thus, the sentencing determination here did notplace petitioner in jeopardy for an "offense."Sentencing decisions favorable to the defendant, moreover,cannot generally be analogized to an acquittal. We haveheld that where an appeals court overturns a conviction onthe ground that the prosecution proffered insufficient evidence of guilt, that finding is comparable to an acquittal, andthe Double Jeopardy Clause precludes a second trial. SeeBurks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1, 16 (1978). Where a similar failure of proof occurs in a sentencing proceeding, however, the analogy is inapt. The pronouncement of sentencesimply does not "have the qualities of constitutional finalitythat attend an acquittal." United States v. DiFrancesco,449 U. S. 117, 134 (1980); see also Bullington, supra, at 438("The imposition of a particular sentence usually is not regarded as an `acquittal' of any more severe sentence thatcould have been imposed").524US2 Unit: $U98 [09-06-00 19:40:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN730 MONGE v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the CourtThe Double Jeopardy Clause "does not provide the defend-ant with the right to know at any specific moment in timewhat the exact limit of his punishment will turn out to be."DiFrancesco, 449 U. S., at 137. Consequently, it is a "wellestablished part of our constitutional jurisprudence" that theguarantee against double jeopardy neither prevents theprosecution from seeking review of a sentence nor restrictsthe length of a sentence imposed upon retrial after a defend-ant's successful appeal. Seeid., at 135; Pearce, supra, at720; see also Stroud v. United States, 251 U. S. 15, 18 (1919)(despite a harsher sentence on retrial, the defendant was not"placed in second jeopardy within the meaning of theConstitution").Our opinion in Bullington established a "narrow exception" to the general rule that double jeopardy principles haveno application in the sentencing context. See Schiro v. Farley, 510 U. S. 222, 231 (1994). In Bullington, a capital defendant had received a sentence of life imprisonment fromthe original sentencing jury. The defendant subsequentlyobtained a new trial on the ground that the court had permitted prospective women jurors to claim automatic exemptionfrom jury service in violation of the Sixth and FourteenthAmendments. 451 U. S., at 436. When the State announced its intention to seek the death penalty again, thedefendant alleged a double jeopardy violation. We determined that the first jury's deliberations bore the "hallmarksof the trial on guilt or innocence," id., at 439, because thejury was presented with a choice between two alternativestogether with standards to guide their decision, the prosecution undertook the burden of establishing facts beyond a reasonable doubt, and the evidence was introduced in a separateproceeding that formally resembled a trial, id., at 438. Inlight of the jury's binary determination and the heightenedprocedural protections, we found the proceeding distinctfrom traditional sentencing, in which "it is impossible to conclude that a sentence less than the statutory maximum `con524US2 Unit: $U98 [09-06-00 19:40:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN731Cite as: 524 U. S. 721 (1998)Opinion of the Courtstitute[s] a decision to the effect that the government hasfailed to prove its case.' "Id., at 443 (quoting Burks, supra,at 15).Moreover, we reasoned that the "embarrassment, expenseand ordeal" as well as the "anxiety and insecurity" that acapital defendant faces "are at least equivalent to that facedby any defendant at the guilt phase of a criminal trial." 451U. S., at 445. And we cited the "unacceptably high risk"that repeated attempts to persuade a jury to impose thedeath penalty would lead to an erroneous capital sentence.Id., at 445-446. We later extended the rule set forth inBullington to a capital sentencing scheme in which thejudge, as opposed to a jury, had initially determined that alife sentence was appropriate. See Arizona v. Rumsey, 467U. S. 203, 209-210 (1984).Petitioner contends that the rationale for imposing a double jeopardy bar in Bullington and Rumsey applies withequal force to California's proceedings to determine thetruth of a prior conviction allegation. Like the Missouricapital sentencing scheme at issue in Bullington, petitionerargues, the sentencing proceedings here have the "hallmarksof a trial on guilt or innocence" because the sentencer makesan objective finding as to whether the prosecution hasproved a historical fact beyond a reasonable doubt. The determination whether a defendant in fact has qualifying priorconvictions may be distinguished, petitioner maintains, fromthe normative decisions typical of traditional sentencing. Inpetitioner's view, once a defendant has obtained a favorablefinding on such an issue, the State should not be permittedto retry the allegation.Even assuming, however, that the proceeding on the priorconviction allegation has the "hallmarks" of a trial that weidentified in Bullington, a critical component of our reasoning in that case was the capital sentencing context. Thepenalty phase of a capital trial is undertaken to assess thegravity of a particular offense and to determine whether it524US2 Unit: $U98 [09-06-00 19:40:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN732 MONGE v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtwarrants the ultimate punishment; it is in many respects acontinuation of the trial on guilt or innocence of capital murder. "It is of vital importance" that the decisions made inthat context "be, and appear to be, based on reason ratherthan caprice or emotion." Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349,358 (1977). Because the death penalty is unique "in both itsseverity and its finality,"id., at 357, we have recognized anacute need for reliability in capital sentencing proceedings.SeeLockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604 (1978) (opinion ofBurger, C. J.) (stating that the "qualitative difference be-tween death and other penalties calls for a greater degreeof reliability when the death sentence is imposed"); see alsoStrickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 704 (1984) (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("[W]e haveconsistently required that capital proceedings be policed atall stages by an especially vigilant concern for proceduralfairness and for the accuracy of factfinding").That need for reliability accords with one of the centralconcerns animating the constitutional prohibition againstdouble jeopardy. As the Court explained in Green v. UnitedStates, 355 U. S. 184 (1957), the Double Jeopardy Clause prevents States from "mak[ing] repeated attempts to convict anindividual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him toembarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him tolive in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as wellas enhancing the possibility that even though innocent hemay be found guilty." Id., at 187-188. Indeed, we cited theheightened interest in accuracy in the Bullington decisionitself. We noted that in a capital sentencing proceeding, asin a criminal trial, " `the interests of the defendant [are] ofsuch magnitude that . . . they have been protected by standards of proof designed to exclude as nearly as possible thelikelihood of an erroneous judgment.' " 451 U. S., at 441(quoting Addington v. Texas, 441 U. S. 418, 423-424 (1979)).Moreover, we have suggested in earlier cases that Bullington's rationale is confined to the "unique circumstances of524US2 Unit: $U98 [09-06-00 19:40:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN733Cite as: 524 U. S. 721 (1998)Opinion of the Courta capital sentencing proceeding." Caspari, 510 U. S., at 392;see also Goldhammer, 474 U. S., at 30 ("[T]he decisions ofthis Court `clearly establish that a sentenc[ing in a noncapital case] does not have the qualities of constitutional finalitythat attend an acquittal' ") (quoting DiFrancesco, 449 U. S.,at 134). In addition, we have cited Bullington as an example of the heightened procedural protections accorded capitaldefendants. See Strickland, supra, at 686-687 ("A capitalsentencing proceeding . . . is sufficiently like a trial in itsadversarial format and in the existence of standards for decision, see [Bullington], that counsel's role in the proceedingis comparable to counsel's role at trial").In an attempt to minimize the relevance of the death penalty context, petitioner argues that the application of doublejeopardy principles turns on the nature rather than the consequences of the proceeding. For example, petitioner notesthat Bullington did not overrule the Court's decision inStroud v. United States, 251 U. S. 15 (1919)--which foundthe double jeopardy bar inapplicable to a particular capitalsentencing proceeding--but rather distinguished it on theground that the proceeding at issue did not bear the hallmarks of a trial on guilt or innocence. Stroud predates ourdecisions in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972) (percuriam), and Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153 (1976) ( jointopinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.); it was decidedat a time when "no significant constitutional difference between the death penalty and lesser punishments for crimehad been expressly recognized by this Court." See Gardner, supra, at 357 (opinion of Stevens, J.). Consequently,the capital sentencing procedures at issue in Stroud did notresemble a trial, and the Court confronted a different question in that case. The holding of Bullington turns on boththe trial-like proceedings at issue and the severity of thepenalty at stake. That the Court focused on the absence ofprocedural safeguards in distinguishing an earlier capital524US2 Unit: $U98 [09-06-00 19:40:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN734 MONGE v. CALIFORNIAStevens, J., dissentingcase does not mean that the Bullington decision rests on apurely procedural rationale.In our death penalty jurisprudence, moreover, the natureand the consequences of capital sentencing proceedings areintertwined. We have held that "in capital cases the fundamental respect for humanity underlying the Eighth Amendment requires consideration of the character and record ofthe individual offender and the circumstances of the particular offense as a constitutionally indispensable part of theprocess of inflicting the penalty of death." Woodson v.North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, 304 (1976) (plurality opinion)(citation omitted). Where noncapital sentencing proceedings contain trial-like protections, that is a matter of legislative grace, not constitutional command. Many States havechosen to implement procedural safeguards to protect defendants who may face dramatic increases in their sentencesas a result of recidivism enhancements. We do not believethat because the States have done so, we are compelled toextend the double jeopardy bar. Indeed, were we to applydouble jeopardy here, we might create disincentives thatwould diminish these important procedural protections.* * *We conclude that Bullington's rationale is confined to theunique circumstances of capital sentencing and that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not preclude retrial on a prior conviction allegation in the noncapital sentencing context. Accordingly, the judgment of the California Supreme Court isaffirmed. It is so ordered.Justice Stevens, dissenting."The Double Jeopardy Clause forbids a second trial for thepurpose of affording the prosecution another opportunity tosupply evidence which it failed to muster in the first proceed524US2 Unit: $U98 [09-06-00 19:40:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN735Cite as: 524 U. S. 721 (1998)Stevens, J., dissentinging." Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1, 11 (1978).1 Today,the Court ignores this cardinal principle. In this case, theprosecution attempted to prove that petitioner had pre-viously been convicted of a qualifying felony. If the prosecution had proved this fact, petitioner would have automati-cally been sentenced to an additional five years in prison.2The prosecution, however, failed to prove its case.3 Conse-quently, the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits a " `secondbite at the apple.' " Id., at 17.Until today, the Court has never held that a retrial or resentencing is permissible when the evidence in the first pro-ceeding wasinsufficient; instead, the Court has consistentlydrawn a line between insufficiency of the evidence and legalerrors that infect the first proceeding.4 In his unanimous1 See also, e. g., Poland v. Arizona, 476 U. S. 147, 152 (1986) (reprosecution or resentencing prohibited whenever "a jury agrees or an appellatecourt decides that the prosecution has not proved its case" (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. Schiro v. Farley, 510 U. S. 222, 231-232 (1994)("The state is entitled to `one fair opportunity' to prosecute a defendant,. . . and that opportunity extends not only to prosecution at the guilt phase,but also to present evidence at an ensuing sentencing proceeding").2 The finding of this fact would have also increased petitioner's sentencing range. See Cal. Health & Safety Code Ann. $ 11361(a) (West 1991).This case, then, is factually different from Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U. S.383, 386-387 (1994), as the factual finding in that case did not automaticallyincrease the respondent's sentence or affect his sentencing range.3 The California appellate court concluded that "[t]here was insufficientevidence that [petitioner] suffered a prior felony conviction" within themeaning of the "three-strikes" law. App. 41 (emphasis omitted). It isimmaterial, of course, that this determination was made by an appellatecourt rather than by the trial judge or jury. Burks v. United States, 437U. S. 1, 11 (1978). The State concedes that the evidence was insufficient.4 See, e. g., Poland, 476 U. S., at 154 ("[The Arizona Supreme Court] didnot hold that the prosecution had failed to prove its case . . . . Indeed,the court clearly indicated that there had been no such failure by remarking that `the trial court mistook the law when it did not find that thedefendants [satisfied the disputed aggravator]' "); United States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U. S. 117, 141 (1980) ("The federal statute specifies that the524US2 Unit: $U98 [09-06-00 19:40:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN736 MONGE v. CALIFORNIAStevens, J., dissentingopinion for the Court in Burks v. United States, Chief JusticeBurger emphasized this critical difference, i. e., "between reversals due to trial error and those resulting from eviden-tiary insufficiency." Id., at 15. He specifically noted "thatthe failure to make this distinction has contributed substan-tially to the present state of conceptual confusion existing inthis area of the law," ibid., and concluded that in order tohold, as we did, "that the Double Jeopardy Clause precludesa second trial once the reviewing court has found the evi-dence legally insufficient," it was necessary to overrule several prior cases, id., at 18. The Court's opinion today re-flects the same failure to recognize the critical importance ofthis distinction.I agree that California's decision to "implement proceduralsafeguards to protect defendants who may face dramatic in-creases in their sentences as a result of recidivism enhancements," ante, at 734, should not create a constitutional ob-ligation that would not otherwise exist. But the factthat so many States have done so--not just recently, but formany years5--is powerful evidence that they were simplyresponding to the traditional understanding of fundamentalfairness that produced decisions such as In re Winship, 397U. S. 358 (1970),6 and Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684Court of Appeals may increase the sentence only if the trial court hasabused its discretion or employed unlawful procedures or made clearlyerroneous findings. The appellate court thus is empowered to correctonly a legal error" (emphasis added)); Bozza v. United States, 330 U. S.160, 166-167 (1947) (error of law that infects a sentence may be correctedon appeal).5 See, e. g., cases cited in Annot., 58 A. L. R. 59-62 (1929); cases cited inAlmendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 256-257 (1998) (Scalia,J., dissenting); see also ante, at 734 ("Many States have chosen to implementprocedural safeguards to protect defendants who may face dramatic increases in their sentences as a result of recidivism enhancements").6 In Winship, despite the fact that the Court had never held "that proofbeyond a reasonable doubt is either expressly or impliedly commanded byany provision of the Constitution," 397 U. S., at 377 (Black, J., dissenting),the traditional importance of that standard that dated "at least from our524US2 Unit: $U98 [09-06-00 19:40:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN737Cite as: 524 U. S. 721 (1998)Scalia, J., dissenting(1975).7 It is this same traditional understanding of funda-mental fairness--dating back centuries to the common-lawplea of autrefois acquit and buttressed by a special interestin finality--that undergirds the Double Jeopardy Clause.8I respectfully dissent.Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.I agree with the Court 's determination that Bullington v.Missouri, 451 U. S. 430 (1981), should not be extended, andits conclusion that the Double Jeopardy Clause does notapply to noncapital sentencing proceedings. I do not, how-ever, agree with the Court's assumption that only a sentencing proceeding was at issue here.Like many other guarantees in the Bill of Rights, the Double Jeopardy Clause makes sense only against the backdropof traditional principles of Anglo-American criminal law. Inthat tradition, defendants are charged with "offence[s]." Acriminal "offence" is composed of "elements," which are fac-tual components that must be proved by the state beyond areasonable doubt and submitted (if the defendant so desires)to a jury. Conviction of an "offence" renders the defendanteligible for a range of potential punishments, from which asentencing authority ( judge or jury) then selects the mostearly years as a Nation," id., at 361, justified our conclusion "that the DueProcess Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proofbeyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crimewith which he is charged," id., at 364.7 In Mullaney, we unanimously extended the protection of Winship todeterminations that go not to a defendant's guilt or innocence, but simplyto the length of his sentence. 421 U.

Post, at 739. It is not, however, Californiathat has taken "the first steps" down the road the Court follows today.It was the Court's decision in McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79(1986).524US2 Unit: $U98 [09-06-00 19:40:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN738 MONGE v. CALIFORNIAScalia, J., dissentingappropriate. That sentencer often considers new factual issues and additional evidence under much less demandingproof requirements than apply at the conviction stage. Thefundamental distinction between facts that are elementsof a criminal offense and facts that go only to the sentenceprovides the foundation for our entire double jeopardy jurisprudence--including the "same elements" test for determining whether two "offence[s]" are "the same," see Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299 (1932), and the rule (atissue here) that the Clause protects an expectation of finalitywith respect to offences but not sentences. The same distinction also delimits the boundaries of other important constitutional rights, like the Sixth Amendment right to trial byjury and the right to proof beyond a reasonable doubt.I do not believe that that distinction is (as the Court seemsto assume) simply a matter of the label affixed to each factby the legislature. Suppose that a State repealed all of theviolent crimes in its criminal code and replaced them withonly one offense, "knowingly causing injury to another,"bearing a penalty of 30 days in prison, but subject to a seriesof "sentencing enhancements" authorizing additional punishment up to life imprisonment or death on the basis of variouslevels of mens rea, severity of injury, and other surroundingcircumstances. Could the State then grant the defendanta jury trial, with requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, solely on the question whether he "knowinglycause[d] injury to another," but leave it for the judge to determine by a preponderance of the evidence whether the defendant acted intentionally or accidentally, whether he useda deadly weapon, and whether the victim ultimately diedfrom the injury the defendant inflicted? If the protectionsextended to criminal defendants by the Bill of Rights can beso easily circumvented, most of them would be, to borrow aphrase from Justice Field, "vain and idle enactment[s], whichaccomplished nothing, and most unnecessarily excited Con524US2 Unit: $U98 [09-06-00 19:40:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN739Cite as: 524 U. S. 721 (1998)Scalia, J., dissentinggress and the people on [their] passage." Slaughter-HouseCases, 16 Wall. 36, 96 (1873).1Although California's system is not nearly that sinister, ittakes the first steps down that road. The California Codeis full of "sentencing enhancements" that look exactly likeseparate crimes, and that expose the defendant to additionalmaximum punishment. Cal. Penal Code $ 12022.5 (1982) istypical: "[A]ny person who personally uses a firearm in thecommission or attempted commission of a felony shall . . . bepunished by an additional term of imprisonment in the stateprison for three, four, or five years." Compare that provision with its federal counterpart, 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1), whichprovides that "[w]hoever, during and in relation to any crimeof violence or drug trafficking crime . . . uses or carries afirearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided forsuch crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, be sentenced to imprisonment for five years." Everyone agreesthat 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1) describes a separate crime entitling those who are charged to the constitutional protectionsthat accompany criminal convictions. Indeed, the undisputed fact that each of the elements of $ 924(c)(1) must be1 The Court suggests that "fundamental fairness" will sometimes call fortreating a particular fact as a sentencing factor rather than an element,even if it increases the defendant's maximum sentencing exposure, because"[a] defendant might not, for example, wish to simultaneously profess hisinnocence of a drug offense and dispute the amount of drugs allegedlyinvolved." Ante, at 729. Even if I agreed that putting a defendant tosuch a choice would be fundamentally unfair, I see no reason to assumethat defendants would be eager to pursue such a strategy at the cost offorfeiting their traditional rights to jury trial and proof beyond a reasonable doubt. But in any event, there is no need to contemplate such Faustian bargains. If simultaneous consideration of two elements would begenuinely prejudicial to the defendant (as, for example, when one of theelements involves the defendant's prior criminal history), the trial can bebifurcated without sacrificing jury factfinding in the second phase. SeeAlmendarez-Torres, 523 U. S. 224, 261, 269 (1998) (Scalia, J., dissenting).524US2 Unit: $U98 [09-06-00 19:40:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN740 MONGE v. CALIFORNIAScalia, J., dissentingsubmitted to a jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt,combined with the fact that many courts were mistaken asto what those elements consisted of, has created considerablejuridical chaos in recent years. See,e. g., Bailey v. UnitedStates, 516 U. S. 137 (1995); Bousley v. United States, 523U. S. 614 (1998). Perhaps Congress should have taken a les-son from the California Legislature, which (if my worst fearsabout today's holding are justified) may have stumbled uponthe El Dorado sought by many in vain since the beginningof the Republic: a means of dispensing with inconvenient con-stitutional "rights." For now, California has used this gimmick only to eviscerate the Double Jeopardy Clause; it stillprovides a right to notice, jury trial, and proof beyond a reasonable doubt on "enhancement" allegations as a matter ofstate law. But if the Court is right today, those protectionscould be withdrawn tomorrow.Earlier this Term, in Almendarez-Torres v. United States,523 U. S. 224 (1998), I discussed our precedents bearing onthis issue and concluded that it was a grave and doubtfulquestion whether the Constitution permits a fact that increases the maximum sentence to which a defendant is exposed to be treated as a sentencing enhancement rather thanan element of a criminal offense. See id., at 260 (dissenting opinion). I stopped short of answering that question,because I thought the doctrine of constitutional doubt required us to interpret the federal statute at issue as settingforth an element rather than an enhancement, thereby avoiding the problem. Ibid. Since the present case involves astate statute already authoritatively construed as an enhancement by the California Supreme Court, I must nowanswer the constitutional question. Petitioner Monge wasconvicted of the crime of using a minor to sell marijuana,which carries a maximum possible sentence of seven yearsin prison under California law. See California Health &Safety Code Ann. $ 11361(a) (West 1991). He was later sentenced to eleven years in prison, however, on the basis of524US2 Unit: $U98 [09-06-00 19:40:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN741Cite as: 524 U. S. 721 (1998)Scalia, J., dissentingseveral additional facts that California and the Court havechosen to label "sentence enhancement allegations." However California chooses to divide and label its criminal code,I believe that for federal constitutional purposes those extrafour years are attributable to conviction of a new crime.2Monge was functionally acquitted of that crime when theCalifornia Court of Appeal held that the evidence adducedat trial was insufficient to sustain the trial court's "enhance-ment" findings, seeBurks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1, 18(1978). Giving the State a second chance to prove himguilty of that same crime would violate the very core of thedouble jeopardy prohibition.That disposition would contradict, of course, the Court'sholding in Almendarez-Torres that "recidivism" findings donot have to be treated as elements of the offense,even if theyincrease the maximum punishment to which the defendant isexposed. That holding was in my view a grave constitutional error affecting the most fundamental of rights. Inote, in any event, that Almendarez-Torres left open thequestion whether "enhancements" that increase the maximum sentence and that do not involve the defendant's priorcriminal history are valid. That qualification is an implicitlimitation on the Court's holding today.I respectfully dissent.2 The Court contends that this issue "was neither considered by the statecourts nor discussed in petitioner's brief before this Court." Ante, at 728.But Monge has argued consistently that reconsideration of the enhancement issue would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. He did not explicitly contend that the enhancement was in reality an element of the offensewith which he was charged, but I believe that was fairly included withinthe argument he did make. "When an issue or claim is properly beforethe court, the court is not limited to the particular legal theories advancedby the parties, but rather retains the independent power to identify andapply the proper construction of governing law."

ELLERTHcertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuitNo. 97-569. Argued April 22, 1998--Decided June 26, 1998Respondent Kimberly Ellerth quit her job after 15 months as a salesperson in one of petitioner Burlington Industries' many divisions, allegedlybecause she had been subjected to constant sexual harassment by oneof her supervisors, Ted Slowik. Slowik was a midlevel manager whohad authority to hire and promote employees, subject to higher approval, but was not considered a policymaker. Against a backgroundof repeated boorish and offensive remarks and gestures allegedly madeby Slowik, Ellerth places particular emphasis on three incidents whereSlowik's comments could be construed as threats to deny her tangiblejob benefits. Ellerth refused all of Slowik's advances, yet suffered notangible retaliation and was, in fact, promoted once. Moreover, shenever informed anyone in authority about Slowik's conduct, despiteknowing Burlington had a policy against sexual harassment. In filingthis lawsuit, Ellerth alleged Burlington engaged in sexual harassmentand forced her constructive discharge, in violation of Title VII of theCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e et seq. The District Courtgranted Burlington summary judgment. The Seventh Circuit en bancreversed in a decision that produced eight separate opinions and no consensus for a controlling rationale. Among other things, those opinionsfocused on whether Ellerth's claim could be categorized as one of quidpro quo harassment, and on whether the standard for an employer'sliability on such a claim should be vicarious liability or negligence.Held: Under Title VII, an employee who refuses the unwelcome andthreatening sexual advances of a supervisor, yet suffers no adverse,tangible job consequences, may recover against the employer withoutshowing the employer is negligent or otherwise at fault for the supervisor's actions, but the employer may interpose an affirmative defense.Pp. 751-766.(a) The Court assumes an important premise yet to be established: Atrier of fact could find in Slowik's remarks numerous threats to retaliateagainst Ellerth if she denied some sexual liberties. The threats, however, were not carried out. Cases based on carried-out threats are referred to often as "quid pro quo" cases, as distinct from bothersomeattentions or sexual remarks sufficient to create a "hostile work environment." Those two terms do not appear in Title VII, which forbids only524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN743Cite as: 524 U. S. 742 (1998)Syllabus"discriminat[ion] against any individual with respect to his . . . terms[or] conditions . . . of employment, because of . . . sex." $ 2000e-2(a)(1).In Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57, 65, this Courtdistinguished between the two concepts, saying both are cognizableunder Title VII, though a hostile environment claim requires harassment that is severe or pervasive. Meritor did not discuss the distinction for its bearing upon an employer's liability for discrimination, butheld, with no further specifics, that agency principles controlled on thispoint. Id., at 72. Nevertheless, in Meritor's wake, Courts of Appealsheld that, if the plaintiff established a quid pro quo claim, the employerwas subject to vicarious liability. This rule encouraged Title VII plaintiffs to state their claims in quid pro quo terms, which in turn put expansive pressure on the definition. For example, the question presented here is phrased as whether Ellerth can state a quid pro quoclaim, but the issue of real concern to the parties is whether Burlingtonhas vicarious liability, rather than liability limited to its own negligence.This Court nonetheless believes the two terms are of limited utility.To the extent they illustrate the distinction between cases involving acarried-out threat and offensive conduct in general, they are relevantwhen there is a threshold question whether a plaintiff can prove discrimination. Hence, Ellerth's claim involves only unfulfilled threats, soit is a hostile work environment claim requiring a showing of severeor pervasive conduct. This Court accepts the District Court's findingthat Ellerth made such a showing. When discrimination is thusproved, the factors discussed below, not the categories quid pro quoand hostile work environment, control on the issue of vicarious liability.Pp. 751-754.(b) In deciding whether an employer has vicarious liability in a casesuch as this, the Court turns to agency law principles, for Title VIIdefines the term "employer" to include "agents." $ 2000e(b). Giventhis express direction, the Court concludes a uniform and predictablestandard must be established as a matter of federal law. The Courtrelies on the general common law of agency, rather than on the law ofany particular State. Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid,490 U. S. 730, 740. The Restatement (Second) of Agency (hereinafterRestatement) is a useful beginning point, although common-law principles may not be wholly transferable to Title VII. See Meritor, supra,at 72. Pp. 754-755.(c) A master is subject to liability for the torts of his servants committed while acting in the scope of their employment. Restatement$ 219(1). Although such torts generally may be either negligent or intentional, sexual harassment under Title VII presupposes intentionalconduct. An intentional tort is within the scope of employment when524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN744 BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES, INC. v. ELLERTHSyllabusactuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the employer. Id.,$$ 228(1)(c), 230. Courts of Appeals have held, however, a supervisoracting out of gender-based animus or a desire to fulfill sexual urges maybe actuated by personal motives unrelated and even antithetical to theemployer's objectives. Thus, the general rule is that sexual harassment by a supervisor is not conduct within the scope of employment.Pp. 755-757.(d) However, scope of employment is not the only basis for employerliability under agency principles. An employer is subject to liability forthe torts of its employees acting outside the scope of their employmentwhen, inter alia, the employer itself was negligent or reckless, Restatement $ 219(2)(b), or the employee purported to act or to speak on behalfof the employer and there was reliance upon apparent authority, or hewas aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation, id., $ 219(2)(d). An employer is negligent, and therefore subject toliability under $ 219(2)(b), if it knew or should have known about sexualharassment and failed to stop it. Negligence sets a minimum standardfor Title VII liability; but Ellerth seeks to invoke the more stringentstandard of vicarious liability. Section 219(2)(d) makes an employer vicariously liable for sexual harassment by an employee who uses apparent authority (the apparent authority standard), or who was "aided inaccomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation" (theaided in the agency relation standard). Pp. 758-759.(e) As a general rule, apparent authority is relevant where the agentpurports to exercise a power which he or she does not have, as distinctfrom threatening to misuse actual power. Compare Restatement $ 6with $ 8. Because supervisory harassment cases involve misuse ofactual power, not the false impression of its existence, apparent authority analysis is inappropriate. When a party seeks to impose vicarious liability based on an agent's misuse of delegated authority, the Restatement's aided in the agency relation rule provides the appropriateanalysis. Pp. 759-760.(f) That rule requires the existence of something more than the employment relation itself because, in a sense, most workplace tortfeasors,whether supervisors or co-workers, are aided in accomplishing their tortious objective by the employment relation: Proximity and regular contact afford a captive pool of potential victims. Such an additional aidexists when a supervisor subjects a subordinate to a significant, tangibleemployment action, i. e., a significant change in employment status, suchas discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment. Every FederalCourt of Appeals to have considered the question has correctly foundvicarious liability in that circumstance. This Court imports the significant, tangible employment action concept for resolution of the vicarious524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN745Cite as: 524 U. S. 742 (1998)Syllabusliability issue considered here. An employer is therefore subject to vicarious liability for such actions. However, where, as here, there is notangible employment action, it is not obvious the agency relationshipaids in commission of the tort. Moreover, Meritor holds that agencyprinciples constrain the imposition of employer liability for supervisorharassment. Limiting employer liability is also consistent with TitleVII's purpose to the extent it would encourage the creation and use ofantiharassment policies and grievance procedures. Thus, in order toaccommodate the agency principle of vicarious liability for harm causedby misuse of supervisory authority, as well as Title VII's equally basicpolicies of encouraging forethought by employers and saving action byobjecting employees, the Court adopts, in this case and in Faragher v.Boca Raton, post, p. 775, the following holding: An employer is subjectto vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostileenvironment created by a supervisor with immediate (or successivelyhigher) authority over the employee. When no tangible employmentaction is taken, a defending employer may raise an affirmative defenseto liability or damages, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c). The defense comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) thatthe plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoidharm otherwise. While proof that an employer had promulgated anantiharassment policy with complaint procedure is not necessary inevery instance as a matter of law, the need for a stated policy suitableto the employment circumstances may appropriately be addressed inany case when litigating the first element of the defense. And whileproof that an employee failed to fulfill the corresponding obligation ofreasonable care to avoid harm is not limited to showing an unreasonablefailure to use any complaint procedure provided by the employer, a demonstration of such failure will normally suffice to satisfy the employer'sburden under the second element of the defense. No affirmative defense is available, however, when the supervisor's harassment culminates in a tangible employment action. Pp. 760-765.(g) Given the Court's explanation that the labels quid pro quo andhostile work environment are not controlling for employer-liability purposes, Ellerth should have an adequate opportunity on remand to proveshe has a claim which would result in vicarious liability. Although shehas not alleged she suffered a tangible employment action at Slowik'shands, which would deprive Burlington of the affirmative defense, thisis not dispositive. In light of the Court's decision, Burlington is still524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN746 BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES, INC. v.

Diebold, Inc., 369 U. S. 654, 655 (1962) (percuriam). The employer is Burlington Industries, the petitioner. The employee is Kimberly Ellerth, the respondent.From March 1993 until May 1994, Ellerth worked as a salesperson in one of Burlington's divisions in Chicago, Illinois.During her employment, she alleges, she was subjectedto constant sexual harassment by her supervisor, one TedSlowik.In the hierarchy of Burlington's management structure,Slowik was a midlevel manager. Burlington has eight divisions, employing more than 22,000 people in some 50 plantsaround the United States. Slowik was a vice president inone of five business units within one of the divisions. Hehad authority to make hiring and promotion decisionssubject to the approval of his supervisor, who signed the pa-perwork. See 912 F. Supp. 1101, 1119, n. 14 (ND Ill. 1996).According to Slowik's supervisor, his position was "notconsidered an upper-level management position," and he was"not amongst the decision-making or policy-making hierar-chy." Ibid. Slowik was not Ellerth's immediate supervisor. Ellerth worked in a two-person office in Chicago, andshe answered to her office colleague, who in turn answeredto Slowik in New York.Against a background of repeated boorish and offensiveremarks and gestures which Slowik allegedly made, Ellerthplaces particular emphasis on three alleged incidents whereSlowik's comments could be construed as threats to deny her524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN748 BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES, INC. v. ELLERTHOpinion of the Courttangible job benefits. In the summer of 1993, while on abusiness trip, Slowik invited Ellerth to the hotel lounge, aninvitation Ellerth felt compelled to accept because Slowikwas her boss. App. 155. When Ellerth gave no encouragement to remarks Slowik made about her breasts, he told herto "loosen up" and warned, "you know, Kim, I could makeyour life very hard or very easy at Burlington."Id., at 156.In March 1994, when Ellerth was being considered for apromotion, Slowik expressed reservations during the promotion interview because she was not "loose enough." Id., at159. The comment was followed by his reaching over andrubbing her knee. Ibid. Ellerth did receive the promotion;but when Slowik called to announce it, he told Ellerth,"you're gonna be out there with men who work in factories,and they certainly like women with pretty butts/legs." Id.,at 159-160.In May 1994, Ellerth called Slowik, asking permission toinsert a customer's logo into a fabric sample. Slowik responded, "I don't have time for you right now, Kim . . .--unless you want to tell me what you're wearing." Id., at 78.Ellerth told Slowik she had to go and ended the call. Ibid.A day or two later, Ellerth called Slowik to ask permissionagain. This time he denied her request, but added something along the lines of, "are you wearing shorter skirts yet,Kim, because it would make your job a whole heck of a loteasier." Id., at 79.A short time later, Ellerth's immediate supervisor cautioned her about returning telephone calls to customers in aprompt fashion. 912 F. Supp., at 1109. In response, Ellerthquit. She faxed a letter giving reasons unrelated to the alleged sexual harassment we have described. Ibid. Aboutthree weeks later, however, she sent a letter explaining shequit because of Slowik's behavior. Ibid.During her tenure at Burlington, Ellerth did not informanyone in authority about Slowik's conduct, despite knowingBurlington had a policy against sexual harassment. Ibid.524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN749Cite as: 524 U. S. 742 (1998)Opinion of the CourtIn fact, she chose not to inform her immediate supervisor(not Slowik) because " `it would be his duty as my supervisorto report any incidents of sexual harassment.' " Ibid. Onone occasion, she told Slowik a comment he made was inappropriate. Ibid.In October 1994, after receiving a right-to-sue letter fromthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC),Ellerth filed suit in the United States District Court for theNorthern District of Illinois, alleging Burlington engaged insexual harassment and forced her constructive discharge, inviolation of Title VII. The District Court granted summaryjudgment to Burlington. The court found Slowik's behavior, as described by Ellerth, severe and pervasive enoughto create a hostile work environment, but found Burlingtonneither knew nor should have known about the conduct.There was no triable issue of fact on the latter point, andthe court noted Ellerth had not used Burlington's internalcomplaint procedures. Id., at 1118. Although Ellerth'sclaim was framed as a hostile work environment complaint,the District Court observed there was a quid pro quo "component" to the hostile environment. Id., at 1121. Proceeding from the premise that an employer faces vicarious liability for quid pro quo harassment, the District Court thoughtit necessary to apply a negligence standard because the quidpro quo merely contributed to the hostile work environment.See id., at 1123. The District Court also dismissed Ellerth'sconstructive discharge claim.The Court of Appeals en banc reversed in a decision whichproduced eight separate opinions and no consensus for acontrolling rationale. The judges were able to agree onthe problem they confronted: Vicarious liability, not failureto comply with a duty of care, was the essence of Ellerth'scase against Burlington on appeal. The judges seemed toagree Ellerth could recover if Slowik's unfulfilled threatsto deny her tangible job benefits was sufficient to imposevicarious liability on Burlington. Jansen v. Packing Corp.524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN750 BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES, INC. v. ELLERTHOpinion of the Courtof America, 123 F. 3d 490, 494 (CA7 1997) (per curiam).With the exception of Judges Coffey and Easterbrook, thejudges also agreed Ellerth's claim could be categorized asone ofquid pro quo harassment, even though she hadreceived the promotion and had suffered no other tangibleretaliation. Ibid.The consensus disintegrated on the standard for an employer's liability for such a claim. Six judges, Judges Flaum,Cummings, Bauer, Evans, Rovner, and Diane P. Wood,agreed the proper standard was vicarious liability, and soEllerth could recover even though Burlington was not negligent. Ibid. They had different reasons for the conclusion.According to Judges Flaum, Cummings, Bauer, and Evans,whether a claim involves a quid pro quo determines whethervicarious liability applies; and they in turn defined quid proquo to include a supervisor's threat to inflict a tangible jobinjury whether or not it was completed. Id., at 499.Judges Wood and Rovner interpreted agency principles toimpose vicarious liability on employers for most claims ofsupervisor sexual harassment, even absent a quid pro quo.Id., at 565.Although Judge Easterbrook did not think Ellerth hadstated a quid pro quo claim, he would have followed the lawof the controlling State to determine the employer's liability,and by this standard, the employer would be liable here.Id., at 552. In contrast, Judge Kanne said Ellerth hadstated a quid pro quo claim, but negligence was the appropriate standard of liability when the quid pro quo involvedthreats only. Id., at 505.Chief Judge Posner, joined by Judge Manion, disagreed.He asserted Ellerth could not recover against Burlington despite having stated a quid pro quo claim. According toChief Judge Posner, an employer is subject to vicarious liability for "act[s] that significantly alte[r] the terms or conditions of employment," or "company act[s]." Id., at 515. Inthe emergent terminology, an unfulfilled quid pro quo is a524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN751Cite as: 524 U. S. 742 (1998)Opinion of the Courtmere threat to do a company act rather than the act itself,and in these circumstances, an employer can be found liablefor its negligence only. Ibid. Chief Judge Posner alsofound Ellerth failed to create a triable issue of fact as toBurlington's negligence. Id., at 517.Judge Coffey rejected all of the above approaches becausehe favored a uniform standard of negligence in almost allsexual harassment cases.Id., at 518.The disagreement revealed in the careful opinions of thejudges of the Court of Appeals reflects the fact that Con-gress has left it to the courts to determine controlling agencylaw principles in a new and difficult area of federal law. Wegranted certiorari to assist in defining the relevant standardsof employer liability. 522 U. S. 1086 (1998).IIAt the outset, we assume an important proposition yet tobe established before a trier of fact. It is a premise assumedas well, in explicit or implicit terms, in the various opinionsby the judges of the Court of Appeals. The premise is: Atrier of fact could find in Slowik's remarks numerous threatsto retaliate against Ellerth if she denied some sexual liberties. The threats, however, were not carried out or fulfilled.Cases based on threats which are carried out are referredto often as quid pro quo cases, as distinct from bothersomeattentions or sexual remarks that are sufficiently severe orpervasive to create a hostile work environment. The termsquid pro quo and hostile work environment are helpful, per-haps, in making a rough demarcation between cases in whichthreats are carried out and those where they are not or areabsent altogether, but beyond this are of limited utility.Section 703(a) of Title VII forbids"an employer--"(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individ-ual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individualwith respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN752 BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES, INC. v. ELLERTHOpinion of the Courtprivileges of employment, because of such individual's. . . sex." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1)."Quid pro quo" and "hostile work environment" do not ap-pear in the statutory text. The terms appeared first in theacademic literature, see C. MacKinnon, Sexual Harassmentof Working Women (1979); found their way into decisions ofthe Courts of Appeals, see, e. g., Henson v. Dundee, 682 F. 2d897, 909 (CA11 1982); and were mentioned in this Court'sdecision in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S.57 (1986). See generally E. Scalia, The Strange Career ofQuid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment, 21 Harv. J. L. & Pub.Policy 307 (1998).In Meritor, the terms served a specific and limited pur-pose. There we considered whether the conduct in questionconstituted discrimination in the terms or conditions of em-ployment in violation of Title VII. We assumed, and withadequate reason, that if an employer demanded sexual favorsfrom an employee in return for a job benefit, discriminationwith respect to terms or conditions of employment was ex-plicit. Less obvious was whether an employer's sexually demeaning behavior altered terms or conditions of employmentin violation of Title VII. We distinguished between quidpro quo claims and hostile environment claims, see 477 U. S.,at 65, and said both were cognizable under Title VII, thoughthe latter requires harassment that is severe or pervasive.Ibid. The principal significance of the distinction is to in-struct that Title VII is violated by either explicit or constructive alterations in the terms or conditions of employ-ment and to explain the latter must be severe or pervasive.The distinction was not discussed for its bearing upon anemployer's liability for an employee's discrimination. Onthis question Meritor held, with no further specifics, thatagency principles controlled.Id., at 72.Nevertheless, as use of the terms grew in the wake ofMeritor, they acquired their own significance. The standardof employer responsibility turned on which type of harass524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN753Cite as: 524 U. S. 742 (1998)Opinion of the Courtment occurred. If the plaintiff established a quid pro quoclaim, the Courts of Appeals held, the employer was subjectto vicarious liability. See Davis v. Sioux City, 115 F. 3d1365, 1367 (CA8 1997);Nichols v. Frank, 42 F. 3d 503, 513-514 (CA9 1994); Bouton v. BMW of North America, Inc., 29F. 3d 103, 106-107 (CA3 1994); Sauers v. Salt Lake County,1 F. 3d 1122, 1127 (CA10 1993);Kauffman v. Allied Signal,Inc., 970 F. 2d 178, 185-186 (CA6), cert. denied, 506 U. S.1041 (1992);Steele v. Offshore Shipbuilding, Inc., 867 F. 2d1311, 1316 (CA11 1989). The rule encouraged Title VIIplaintiffs to state their claims asquid pro quo claims, whichin turn put expansive pressure on the definition. The equiv-alence of thequid pro quo label and vicarious liability is illustrated by this case. The question presented on certiorari iswhether Ellerth can state a claim of quid pro quo harass-ment, but the issue of real concern to the parties is whetherBurlington has vicarious liability for Slowik's alleged mis-conduct, rather than liability limited to its own negligence.The question presented for certiorari asks:"Whether a claim of quid pro quo sexual harassmentmay be stated under Title VII . . . where the plaintiffemployee has neither submitted to the sexual advancesof the alleged harasser nor suffered any tangible effectson the compensation, terms, conditions or privileges ofemployment as a consequence of a refusal to submit tothose advances?" Pet. for Cert. i.We do not suggest the terms quid pro quo and hostilework environment are irrelevant to Title VII litigation. Tothe extent they illustrate the distinction between cases involving a threat which is carried out and offensive conductin general, the terms are relevant when there is a thresholdquestion whether a plaintiff can prove discrimination in violation of Title VII. When a plaintiff proves that a tangibleemployment action resulted from a refusal to submit to asupervisor's sexual demands, he or she establishes that the524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN754 BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES, INC. v. ELLERTHOpinion of the Courtemployment decision itself constitutes a change in the termsand conditions of employment that is actionable under TitleVII. For any sexual harassment preceding the employmentdecision to be actionable, however, the conduct must be severe or pervasive. Because Ellerth's claim involves only un-fulfilled threats, it should be categorized as a hostile workenvironment claim which requires a showing of severe orpervasive conduct. SeeOncale v. Sundowner OffshoreServices, Inc., 523 U. S. 75, 81 (1998); Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U. S. 17, 21 (1993). For purposes of this case,we accept the District Court's finding that the alleged conduct was severe or pervasive. See supra, at 749. The casebefore us involves numerous alleged threats, and we expressno opinion as to whether a single unfulfilled threat is suffi-cient to constitute discrimination in the terms or conditionsof employment.When we assume discrimination can be proved, however,the factors we discuss below, and not the categories quid proquo and hostile work environment, will be controlling on theissue of vicarious liability. That is the question we mustresolve. IIIWe must decide, then, whether an employer has vicariousliability when a supervisor creates a hostile work environment by making explicit threats to alter a subordinate'sterms or conditions of employment, based on sex, but doesnot fulfill the threat. We turn to principles of agency law,for the term "employer" is defined under Title VII to include"agents." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e(b); seeMeritor, supra, at 72.In express terms, Congress has directed federal courts tointerpret Title VII based on agency principles. Given suchan explicit instruction, we conclude a uniform and predictable standard must be established as a matter of federal law.We rely "on the general common law of agency, rather thanon the law of any particular State, to give meaning to these524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN755Cite as: 524 U. S. 742 (1998)Opinion of the Courtterms." Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid,490 U. S. 730, 740 (1989). The resulting federal rule, basedon a body of case law developed over time, is statutory inter-pretation pursuant to congressional direction. This is notfederal common law in "the strictest sense, i. e., a rule ofdecision that amounts, not simply to an interpretation of afederal statute . . . , but, rather, to the judicial `creation' of aspecial federal rule of decision."Atherton v. FDIC, 519U. S. 213, 218 (1997). State-court decisions, applying stateemployment discrimination law, may be instructive in apply-ing general agency principles, but, it is interesting to note,in many cases their determinations of employer liabilityunder state law rely in large part on federal-court decisionsunder Title VII. E. g., Arizona v. Schallock, 189 Ariz. 250,259, 941 P. 2d 1275, 1284 (1997);Lehmann v. Toys `R' Us,Inc., 132 N. J. 587, 622, 626 A. 2d 445, 463 (1993); Thompsonv. Berta Enterprises, Inc., 72 Wash. App. 531, 537-539, 864P. 2d 983, 986-988 (1994).As Meritor acknowledged, the Restatement (Second) ofAgency (1957) (hereinafter Restatement) is a useful beginning point for a discussion of general agency principles. 477U. S., at 72. Since our decision inMeritor, federal courtshave explored agency principles, and we find useful instruction in their decisions, noting that "common-law principlesmay not be transferable in all their particulars to Title VII."Ibid. The EEOC has issued Guidelines governing sexualharassment claims under Title VII, but they provide littleguidance on the issue of employer liability for supervisorharassment. See 29 CFR $ 1604.11(c) (1997) (vicarious liabil-ity for supervisor harassment turns on "the particular employment relationship and the job functions performed bythe individual").ASection 219(1) of the Restatement sets out a central principle of agency law:524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN756 BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES, INC. v. ELLERTHOpinion of the Court"A master is subject to liability for the torts of hisservants committed while acting in the scope of theiremployment."An employer may be liable for both negligent and inten-tional torts committed by an employee within the scope ofhis or her employment. Sexual harassment under Title VIIpresupposes intentional conduct. While early decisions absolved employers of liability for the intentional torts of theiremployees, the law now imposes liability where the employee's "purpose, however misguided, is wholly or in part tofurther the master's business." W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R.Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts$ 70, p. 505 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter Prosser and Keetonon Torts). In applying scope of employment principles tointentional torts, however, it is accepted that "it is less likelythat a willful tort will properly be held to be in the courseof employment and that the liability of the master for suchtorts will naturally be more limited." F. Mechem, Outlinesof the Law of Agency $ 394, p. 266 (P. Mechem 4th ed. 1952).The Restatement defines conduct, including an intentionaltort, to be within the scope of employment when "actuated,at least in part, by a purpose to serve the [employer]," evenif it is forbidden by the employer. Restatement $$ 228(1)(c),230. For example, when a salesperson lies to a customerto make a sale, the tortious conduct is within the scope ofemployment because it benefits the employer by increasingsales, even though it may violate the employer's policies.See Prosser and Keeton on Torts $ 70, at 505-506.As Courts of Appeals have recognized, a supervisor actingout of gender-based animus or a desire to fulfill sexual urgesmay not be actuated by a purpose to serve the employer.See, e. g., Harrison v. Eddy Potash, Inc., 112 F. 3d 1437, 1444(CA10 1997), vacated on other grounds,post, p. 947; Torresv. Pisano, 116 F. 3d 625, 634, n. 10 (CA2 1997). But seeKauffman v. Allied Signal, Inc., 970 F. 2d, at 184-185 (hold-ing harassing supervisor acted within scope of employment,524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN757Cite as: 524 U. S. 742 (1998)Opinion of the Courtbut employer was not liable because of its quick and effectiveremediation). The harassing supervisor often acts for personal motives, motives unrelated and even antithetical tothe objectives of the employer. Cf. Mechem,supra, $ 368("[F]or the time being [the supervisor] is conspicuously andunmistakably seeking a personal end"); see also Restatement$ 235, Illustration 2 (tort committed while "[a]cting purelyfrom personal ill will" not within the scope of employment);id., Illustration 3 (tort committed in retaliation for failing topay the employee a bribe not within the scope of employ-ment). There are instances, of course, where a supervisorengages in unlawful discrimination with the purpose, mistaken or otherwise, to serve the employer. E. g., Sims v.Montgomery County Comm'n, 766 F. Supp. 1052, 1075 (MDAla. 1990) (supervisor acting in scope of employment whereemployer has a policy of discouraging women from seekingadvancement and "sexual harassment was simply a way offurthering that policy").The concept of scope of employment has not always beenconstrued to require a motive to serve the employer. E. g.,Ira S. Bushey & Sons, Inc. v. United States, 398 F. 2d 167,172 (CA2 1968). Federal courts have nonetheless found similar limitations on employer liability when applying theagency laws of the States under the Federal Tort ClaimsAct, which makes the Federal Government liable for tortscommitted by employees within the scope of employment.28 U. S. C. $ 1346(b); see, e. g., Jamison v. Wiley, 14 F. 3d 222,237 (CA4 1994) (supervisor's unfair criticism of subordinate'swork in retaliation for rejecting his sexual advances notwithin scope of employment); Wood v. United States, 995F. 2d 1122, 1123 (CA1 1993) (Breyer, C. J.) (sexual harassment amounting to assault and battery "clearly outside thescope of employment"); see also 2 L. Jayson & R. Longstreth,Handling Federal Tort Claims $ 9.07[4], p. 9-211 (1998).The general rule is that sexual harassment by a supervisoris not conduct within the scope of employment.524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN758 BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES, INC. v. ELLERTHOpinion of the CourtBScope of employment does not define the only basis foremployer liability under agency principles. In limited circumstances, agency principles impose liability on employerseven where employees commit torts outside the scope of employment. The principles are set forth in the much-cited$ 219(2) of the Restatement:"(2) A master is not subject to liability for the torts ofhis servants acting outside the scope of their employment, unless:"(a) the master intended the conduct or the consequences, or"(b) the master was negligent or reckless, or"(c) the conduct violated a non-delegable duty of themaster, or"(d) the servant purported to act or to speak on behalfof the principal and there was reliance upon apparentauthority, or he was aided in accomplishing the tort bythe existence of the agency relation."See also $ 219, Comment e (Section 219(2) "enumerates thesituations in which a master may be liable for torts of servants acting solely for their own purposes and hence not inthe scope of employment").Subsection (a) addresses direct liability, where the em-ployer acts with tortious intent, and indirect liability, wherethe agent's high rank in the company makes him or her theemployer's alter ego. None of the parties contend Slowik'srank imputes liability under this principle. There is no con-tention, furthermore, that a nondelegable duty is involved.See $ 219(2)(c). So, for our purposes here, subsections (a)and (c) can be put aside.Subsections (b) and (d) are possible grounds for imposingemployer liability on account of a supervisor's acts and mustbe considered. Under subsection (b), an employer is liablewhen the tort is attributable to the employer's own negli524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN759Cite as: 524 U. S. 742 (1998)Opinion of the Courtgence. $ 219(2)(b). Thus, although a supervisor's sexualharassment is outside the scope of employment because theconduct was for personal motives, an employer can be liable,nonetheless, where its own negligence is a cause of the harassment. An employer is negligent with respect to sexualharassment if it knew or should have known about the conduct and failed to stop it. Negligence sets a minimumstandard for employer liability under Title VII; but Ellerthseeks to invoke the more stringent standard of vicariousliability.Section 219(2)(d) concerns vicarious liability for intentionaltorts committed by an employee when the employee usesapparent authority (the apparent authority standard), orwhen the employee "was aided in accomplishing the tortby the existence of the agency relation" (the aided in theagency relation standard). Ibid. As other federal decisions have done in discussing vicarious liability for supervi-sor harassment, e. g., Henson v. Dundee, 682 F. 2d 897, 909(CA11 1982), we begin with $ 219(2)(d).CAs a general rule, apparent authority is relevant wherethe agent purports to exercise a power which he or she doesnot have, as distinct from where the agent threatens tomisuse actual power. Compare Restatement $ 6 (defining"power") with $ 8 (defining "apparent authority"). In theusual case, a supervisor's harassment involves misuse of actual power, not the false impression of its existence. Appar-ent authority analysis therefore is inappropriate in this context. If, in the unusual case, it is alleged there is a falseimpression that the actor was a supervisor, when he in factwas not, the victim's mistaken conclusion must be a reason-able one. Restatement $ 8, Commentc ("Apparent author-ity exists only to the extent it is reasonable for the thirdperson dealing with the agent to believe that the agent isauthorized"). When a party seeks to impose vicarious liabil524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN760 BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES, INC. v. ELLERTHOpinion of the Courtity based on an agent's misuse of delegated authority, theRestatement's aided in the agency relation rule, rather thanthe apparent authority rule, appears to be the appropriateform of analysis.DWe turn to the aided in the agency relation standard. In asense, most workplace tortfeasors are aided in accomplishingtheir tortious objective by the existence of the agency rela-tion: Proximity and regular contact may afford a captive poolof potential victims. See Gary v. Long, 59 F. 3d 1391, 1397(CADC 1995). Were this to satisfy the aided in the agencyrelation standard, an employer would be subject to vicariousliability not only for all supervisor harassment, but also forall co-worker harassment, a result enforced by neither theEEOC nor any court of appeals to have considered the issue.See, e. g., Blankenship v. Parke Care Centers, Inc., 123 F. 3d868, 872 (CA6 1997), cert. denied, 522 U. S. 1110 (1998) (sexdiscrimination); McKenzie v. Illinois Dept. of Transp., 92F. 3d 473, 480 (CA7 1996) (sex discrimination);Daniels v.Essex Group, Inc., 937 F. 2d 1264, 1273 (CA7 1991) (race discrimination); see also 29 CFR $ 1604.11(d) (1997) ("knows orshould have known" standard of liability for cases of harassment between "fellow employees"). The aided in the agencyrelation standard, therefore, requires the existence of something more than the employment relation itself.At the outset, we can identify a class of cases where, beyond question, more than the mere existence of the employ-ment relation aids in commission of the harassment: when asupervisor takes a tangible employment action against thesubordinate. Every Federal Court of Appeals to have considered the question has found vicarious liability when adiscriminatory act results in a tangible employment action.See, e. g., Sauers v. Salt Lake County, 1 F. 3d 1122, 1127(CA10 1993) (" `If the plaintiff can show that she suffered aneconomic injury from her supervisor's actions, the employerbecomes strictly liable without any further showing . . .' ").524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN761Cite as: 524 U. S. 742 (1998)Opinion of the CourtIn Meritor, we acknowledged this consensus. See 477 U. S.,at 70-71 ("[T]he courts have consistently held employersliable for the discriminatory discharges of employees by su-pervisory personnel, whether or not the employer knew, orshould have known, or approved of the supervisor's actions").Although few courts have elaborated how agency principlessupport this rule, we think it reflects a correct application ofthe aided in the agency relation standard.In the context of this case, a tangible employment actionwould have taken the form of a denial of a raise or a promo-tion. The concept of a tangible employment action appearsin numerous cases in the Courts of Appeals discussing claimsinvolving race, age, and national origin discrimination, aswell as sex discrimination. Without endorsing the specificresults of those decisions, we think it prudent to import theconcept of a tangible employment action for resolution of thevicarious liability issue we consider here. A tangible employment action constitutes a significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or adecision causing a significant change in benefits. CompareCrady v. Liberty Nat. Bank & Trust Co. of Ind., 993 F. 2d132, 136 (CA7 1993) ("A materially adverse change might beindicated by a termination of employment, a demotion evidenced by a decrease in wage or salary, a less distinguishedtitle, a material loss of benefits, significantly diminished material responsibilities, or other indices that might be uniqueto a particular situation"), with Flaherty v. Gas ResearchInstitute, 31 F. 3d 451, 456 (CA7 1994) (a "bruised ego" is notenough), Kocsis v. Multi-Care Management, Inc., 97 F. 3d876, 887 (CA6 1996) (demotion without change in pay, benefits, duties, or prestige insufficient), and Harlston v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 37 F. 3d 379, 382 (CA8 1994) (reassignment to more inconvenient job insufficient).When a supervisor makes a tangible employment decision,there is assurance the injury could not have been inflicted524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN762 BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES, INC. v. ELLERTHOpinion of the Courtabsent the agency relation. A tangible employment actionin most cases inflicts direct economic harm. As a generalproposition, only a supervisor, or other person acting withthe authority of the company, can cause this sort of injury.A co-worker can break a co-worker's arm as easily as asupervisor, and anyone who has regular contact with anemployee can inflict psychological injuries by his or heroffensive conduct. See Gary, supra, at 1397; Henson, 682F. 2d, at 910;Barnes v. Costle, 561 F. 2d 983, 996 (CADC1977) (MacKinnon, J., concurring). But one co-worker (ab-sent some elaborate scheme) cannot dock another's pay, norcan one co-worker demote another. Tangible employmentactions fall within the special province of the supervisor.The supervisor has been empowered by the company as adistinct class of agent to make economic decisions affectingother employees under his or her control.Tangible employment actions are the means by which thesupervisor brings the official power of the enterprise to bearon subordinates. A tangible employment decision requiresan official act of the enterprise, a company act. The decisionin most cases is documented in official company records, andmay be subject to review by higher level supervisors. E. g.,Shager v. Upjohn Co., 913 F. 2d 398, 405 (CA7 1990) (notingthat the supervisor did not fire plaintiff; rather, the CareerPath Committee did, but the employer was still liable because the committee functioned as the supervisor's "cat'spaw"). The supervisor often must obtain the imprimatur ofthe enterprise and use its internal processes. See Kotcherv. Rosa & Sullivan Appliance Center, Inc., 957 F. 2d 59,62 (CA2 1992) ("From the perspective of the employee, thesupervisor and the employer merge into a single entity").For these reasons, a tangible employment action taken bythe supervisor becomes for Title VII purposes the act of theemployer. Whatever the exact contours of the aided in theagency relation standard, its requirements will always bemet when a supervisor takes a tangible employment action524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN763Cite as: 524 U. S. 742 (1998)Opinion of the Courtagainst a subordinate. In that instance, it would be implau-sible to interpret agency principles to allow an employer toescape liability, as Meritor itself appeared to acknowledge.Seesupra, at 760-761.Whether the agency relation aids in commission of supervisor harassment which does not culminate in a tangible em-ployment action is less obvious. Application of the standardis made difficult by its malleable terminology, which can beread to either expand or limit liability in the context ofsupervisor harassment. On the one hand, a supervisor'spower and authority invests his or her harassing conductwith a particular threatening character, and in this sense,a supervisor always is aided by the agency relation. SeeMeritor, 477 U. S., at 77 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment) ("[I]t is precisely because the supervisor is understoodto be clothed with the employer's authority that he is ableto impose unwelcome sexual conduct on subordinates"). Onthe other hand, there are acts of harassment a supervisormight commit which might be the same acts a coemployeewould commit, and there may be some circumstances wherethe supervisor's status makes little difference.It is this tension which, we think, has caused so much confusion among the Courts of Appeals which have sought toapply the aided in the agency relation standard to Title VIIcases. The aided in the agency relation standard, however,is a developing feature of agency law, and we hesitate torender a definitive explanation of our understanding of thestandard in an area where other important considerationsmust affect our judgment. In particular, we are bound byour holding in Meritor that agency principles constrain theimposition of vicarious liability in cases of supervisory harassment. See id., at 72 ("Congress' decision to define `employer' to include any `agent' of an employer, 42 U. S. C.$ 2000e(b), surely evinces an intent to place some limits onthe acts of employees for which employers under Title VIIare to be held responsible"). Congress has not altered Mer524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN764 BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES, INC. v. ELLERTHOpinion of the Courtitor's rule even though it has made significant amendmentsto Title VII in the interim. SeeIllinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720, 736 (1977) ("[W]e must bear in mind thatconsiderations ofstare decisis weigh heavily in the area ofstatutory construction, where Congress is free to change thisCourt's interpretation of its legislation").AlthoughMeritor suggested the limitation on employerliability stemmed from agency principles, the Court acknowl-edged other considerations might be relevant as well. See477 U. S., at 72 ("common-law principles may not be transfer-able in all their particulars to Title VII"). For example,Title VII is designed to encourage the creation of antiharassment policies and effective grievance mechanisms. Wereemployer liability to depend in part on an employer's effortto create such procedures, it would effect Congress' intentionto promote conciliation rather than litigation in the Title VIIcontext, see EEOC v. Shell Oil Co., 466 U. S. 54, 77 (1984),and the EEOC's policy of encouraging the developmentof grievance procedures. See 29 CFR $ 1604.11(f) (1997);EEOC Policy Guidance on Sexual Harassment, 8 BNA FEPManual 405:6699 (Mar. 19, 1990). To the extent limiting employer liability could encourage employees to report harassing conduct before it becomes severe or pervasive, it wouldalso serve Title VII's deterrent purpose. See McKennon v.Nashville Banner Publishing Co., 513 U. S. 352, 358 (1995).As we have observed, Title VII borrows from tort law theavoidable consequences doctrine, see Ford Motor Co. v.EEOC, 458 U. S. 219, 231, n. 15 (1982), and the considerationswhich animate that doctrine would also support the limitation of employer liability in certain circumstances.In order to accommodate the agency principles of vicariousliability for harm caused by misuse of supervisory authority,as well as Title VII's equally basic policies of encouragingforethought by employers and saving action by objecting employees, we adopt the following holding in this case and inFaragher v. Boca Raton, post, p. 775, also decided today.524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN765Cite as: 524 U. S. 742 (1998)Opinion of the CourtAn employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimizedemployee for an actionable hostile environment created by asupervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authorityover the employee. When no tangible employment action istaken, a defending employer may raise an affirmative de-fense to liability or damages, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c). Thedefense comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correctpromptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that theplaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage ofany preventive or corrective opportunities provided by theemployer or to avoid harm otherwise. While proof that anemployer had promulgated an antiharassment policy withcomplaint procedure is not necessary in every instance as amatter of law, the need for a stated policy suitable to theemployment circumstances may appropriately be addressedin any case when litigating the first element of the defense.And while proof that an employee failed to fulfill the cor-responding obligation of reasonable care to avoid harm isnot limited to showing an unreasonable failure to use anycomplaint procedure provided by the employer, a demonstration of such failure will normally suffice to satisfy theemployer's burden under the second element of the defense. No affirmative defense is available, however, whenthe supervisor's harassment culminates in a tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion, or undesirablereassignment.IVRelying on existing case law which held out the promiseof vicarious liability for allquid pro quo claims, see supra,at 752-753, Ellerth focused all her attention in the Courtof Appeals on proving her claim fit within that category.Given our explanation that the labels quid pro quo and hostile work environment are not controlling for purposes ofestablishing employer liability, see supra, at 754, Ellerth524US2 Unit: $U99 [09-15-00 14:41:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN766 BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES, INC. v. ELLERTHThomas, J., dissentingshould have an adequate opportunity to prove she has aclaim for which Burlington is liable.Although Ellerth has not alleged she suffered a tangibleemployment action at the hands of Slowik, which woulddeprive Burlington of the availability of the affirmativedefense, this is not dispositive. In light of our decision,Burlington is still subject to vicarious liability for Slowik'sactivity, but Burlington should have an opportunity to assertand prove the affirmative defense to liability. See supra,at 765.For these reasons, we will affirm the judgment of theCourt of Appeals, reversing the grant of summary judgmentagainst Ellerth. On remand, the District Court will havethe opportunity to decide whether it would be appropriateto allow Ellerth to amend her pleading or supplement herdiscovery.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
