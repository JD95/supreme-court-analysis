This case raises the question whether a tenant by the en-tirety possesses "property" or "rights to property" to whicha federal tax lien may attach. 26 U. S. C. $ 6321. Relyingon the state law fiction that a tenant by the entirety has noseparate interest in entireties property, the United StatesCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that such property is exempt from the tax lien. We conclude that, despitethe fiction, each tenant possesses individual rights in the estate sufficient to constitute "property" or "rights to prop-erty" for the purposes of the lien, and reverse the judgmentof the Court of Appeals. IIn 1988, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assessed$482,446 in unpaid income tax liabilities against Don Craft,the husband of respondent Sandra L. Craft, for failure to filefederal income tax returns for the years 1979 through 1986.App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a, 72a. When he failed to pay,a federal tax lien attached to "all property and rights toproperty, whether real or personal, belonging to" him.26 U. S. C. $ 6321.At the time the lien attached, respondent and her husbandowned a piece of real property in Grand Rapids, Michigan,as tenants by the entirety. App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a.After notice of the lien was filed, they jointly executed a535US1 Unit: $U39 [09-18-03 17:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN277Cite as: 535 U. S. 274 (2002)Opinion of the Courtquitclaim deed purporting to transfer the husband's interestin the property to respondent for one dollar.Ibid. Whenrespondent attempted to sell the property a few years later,a title search revealed the lien. The IRS agreed to releasethe lien and allow the sale with the stipulation that half ofthe net proceeds be held in escrow pending determination ofthe Government's interest in the property. Ibid.Respondent brought this action to quiet title to the es-crowed proceeds. The Government claimed that its lien hadattached to the husband's interest in the tenancy by the en-tirety. It further asserted that the transfer of the propertyto respondent was invalid as a fraud on creditors. Id., at46a-47a. The District Court granted the Government'smotion for summary judgment, holding that the federal taxlien attached at the moment of the transfer to respondent,which terminated the tenancy by the entirety and entitledthe Government to one-half of the value of the property.No. 1:93-CV-306, 1994 WL 669680, *3 (WD Mich., Sept. 12,1994).Both parties appealed. The Sixth Circuit held that thetax lien did not attach to the property because under Michigan state law, the husband had no separate interest in property held as a tenant by the entirety. 140 F. 3d 638, 643(1998). It remanded to the District Court to consider theGovernment's alternative claim that the conveyance shouldbe set aside as fraudulent. Id., at 644.On remand, the District Court concluded that where, ashere, state law makes property exempt from the claims ofcreditors, no fraudulent conveyance can occur. 65 F. Supp.2d 651, 657-658 (WD Mich. 1999). It found, however, thatrespondent's husband's use of nonexempt funds to pay themortgage on the entireties property, which placed them beyond the reach of creditors, constituted a fraudulent actunder state law, and the court awarded the IRS a share ofthe proceeds of the sale of the property equal to that amount.Id., at 659.535US1 Unit: $U39 [09-18-03 17:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN278 UNITED STATES v. CRAFTOpinion of the CourtBoth parties appealed the District Court's decision, theGovernment again claiming that its lien attached to thehusband's interest in the entireties property. The Court ofAppeals held that the prior panel's opinion was law of thecase on that issue. 233 F. 3d 358, 363-369 (CA6 2000). Italso affirmed the District Court's determination that thehusband's mortgage payments were fraudulent. Id., at369-375.We granted certiorari to consider the Government's claimthat respondent's husband had a separate interest in the entireties property to which the federal tax lien attached. 533U. S. 976 (2001).IIWhether the interests of respondent's husband in the prop-erty he held as a tenant by the entirety constitutes "propertyand rights to property" for the purposes of the federal taxlien statute, 26 U. S. C. $ 6321, is ultimately a question of federal law. The answer to this federal question, however,largely depends upon state law. The federal tax lien statuteitself "creates no property rights but merely attaches conse-quences, federally defined, to rights created under statelaw." United States v. Bess, 357 U. S. 51, 55 (1958); see alsoUnited States v. National Bank of Commerce, 472 U. S. 713,722 (1985). Accordingly, "[w]e look initially to state law todetermine what rights the taxpayer has in the property theGovernment seeks to reach, then to federal law to determinewhether the taxpayer's state-delineated rights qualify as`property' or `rights to property' within the compass of thefederal tax lien legislation."Drye v. United States, 528U. S. 49, 58 (1999).A common idiom describes property as a "bundle ofsticks"--a collection of individual rights which, in certaincombinations, constitute property. See B. Cardozo, Para-doxes of Legal Science 129 (1928) (reprint 2000); see alsoDickman v. Commissioner, 465 U. S. 330, 336 (1984). Statelaw determines only which sticks are in a person's bundle.535US1 Unit: $U39 [09-18-03 17:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN279Cite as: 535 U. S. 274 (2002)Opinion of the CourtWhether those sticks qualify as "property" for purposes ofthe federal tax lien statute is a question of federal law.In looking to state law, we must be careful to consider thesubstance of the rights state law provides, not merely thelabels the State gives these rights or the conclusions it drawsfrom them. Such state law labels are irrelevant to the federal question of which bundles of rights constitute propertythat may be attached by a federal tax lien. InDrye v.United States, supra, we considered a situation where statelaw allowed an heir subject to a federal tax lien to disclaimhis interest in the estate. The state law also provided thatsuch a disclaimer would "creat[e] the legal fiction" that theheir had predeceased the decedent and would correspondingly be deemed to have had no property interest in the es-tate. Id., at 53. We unanimously held that this state lawfiction did not control the federal question and looked insteadto the realities of the heir's interest. We concluded that,despite the State's characterization, the heir possessed a"right to property" in the estate--the right to accept theinheritance or pass it along to another--to which the federallien could attach.Id., at 59-61.IIIWe turn first to the question of what rights respondent'shusband had in the entireties property by virtue of statelaw. In order to understand these rights, the tenancy bythe entirety must first be placed in some context.English common law provided three legal structures forthe concurrent ownership of property that have survivedinto modern times: tenancy in common, joint tenancy, andtenancy by the entirety. 1 G. Thompson, Real Property$ 4.06(g) (D. Thomas ed. 1994) (hereinafter Thompson). Thetenancy in common is now the most common form of concurrent ownership. 7 R. Powell & P. Rohan, Real Property$ 51.01[3] (M. Wolf ed. 2001) (hereinafter Powell). The common law characterized tenants in common as each owning535US1 Unit: $U39 [09-18-03 17:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN280 UNITED STATES v. CRAFTOpinion of the Courta separate fractional share in undivided property. Id.,$ 50.01[1]. Tenants in common may each unilaterally alienate their shares through sale or gift or place encumbrancesupon these shares. They also have the power to pass theseshares to their heirs upon death. Tenants in common havemany other rights in the property, including the right touse the property, to exclude third parties from it, andto receive a portion of any income produced from it. Id.,$$ 50.03-50.06.Joint tenancies were the predominant form of concurrentownership at common law, and still persist in some Statestoday. 4 Thompson $ 31.05. The common law characterizedeach joint tenant as possessing the entire estate, rather thana fractional share: "[J]oint-tenants have one and the sameinterest . . . held by one and the same undivided possession."2 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 180(1766). Joint tenants possess many of the rights enjoyed bytenants in common: the right to use, to exclude, and to enjoya share of the property's income. The main difference between a joint tenancy and a tenancy in common is that a jointtenant also has a right of automatic inheritance known as"survivorship." Upon the death of one joint tenant, thattenant's share in the property does not pass through will orthe rules of intestate succession; rather, the remaining tenant or tenants automatically inherit it. Id., at 183; 7 Powell$ 51.01[3]. Joint tenants' right to alienate their individualshares is also somewhat different. In order for one tenantto alienate his or her individual interest in the tenancy, theestate must first be severed--that is, converted to a tenancyin common with each tenant possessing an equal fractionalshare. Id., $ 51.04[1]. Most States allowing joint tenanciesfacilitate alienation, however, by allowing severance to automatically accompany a conveyance of that interest or anyother overt act indicating an intent to sever. Ibid.A tenancy by the entirety is a unique sort of concurrentownership that can only exist between married persons. 4535US1 Unit: $U39 [09-18-03 17:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN281Cite as: 535 U. S. 274 (2002)Opinion of the CourtThompson $ 33.02. Because of the common-law fiction thatthe husband and wife were one person at law (that person,practically speaking, was the husband, see J. Cribbet et al.,Cases and Materials on Property 329 (6th ed. 1990)), Blackstone did not characterize the tenancy by the entirety as aform of concurrent ownership at all. Instead, he thoughtthat entireties property was a form of single ownership bythe marital unity. Orth, Tenancy by the Entirety: TheStrange Career of the Common-Law Marital Estate, 1997B. Y. U. L. Rev. 35, 38-39. Neither spouse was consideredto own any individual interest in the estate; rather, it belonged to the couple.Like joint tenants, tenants by the entirety enjoy the rightof survivorship. Also like a joint tenancy, unilateral alienation of a spouse's interest in entireties property is typicallynot possible without severance. Unlike joint tenancies,however, tenancies by the entirety cannot easily be severedunilaterally. 4 Thompson $ 33.08(b). Typically, severancerequires the consent of both spouses, id., $ 33.08(a), or theending of the marriage in divorce, id., $ 33.08(d). At common law, all of the other rights associated with the entiretiesproperty belonged to the husband: as the head of the household, he could control the use of the property and the exclusion of others from it and enjoy all of the income producedfrom it. Id., $ 33.05. The husband's control of the propertywas so extensive that, despite the rules on alienation, thecommon law eventually provided that he could unilaterallyalienate entireties property without severance subject onlyto the wife's survivorship interest. Orth, supra, at 40-41.With the passage of the Married Women's Property Actsin the late 19th century granting women distinct rights withrespect to marital property, most States either abolished thetenancy by the entirety or altered it significantly. 7 Powell$ 52.01[2]. Michigan's version of the estate is typical of themodern tenancy by the entirety. Following Blackstone,Michigan characterizes its tenancy by the entirety as creat535US1 Unit: $U39 [09-18-03 17:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN282 UNITED STATES v. CRAFTOpinion of the Courting no individual rights whatsoever: "It is well settled underthe law of this State that one tenant by the entirety has nointerest separable from that of the other . . . . Each isvested with an entire title."Long v. Earle, 277 Mich. 505,517, 269 N. W. 577, 581 (1936). And yet, in Michigan, eachtenant by the entirety possesses the right of survivorship.Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. $ 554.872(g) (West Supp. 1997),recodified at $ 700.2901(2)(g) (West Supp. Pamphlet 2001).Each spouse--the wife as well as the husband--may also usethe property, exclude third parties from it, and receive anequal share of the income produced by it. See $ 557.71(West 1988). Neither spouse may unilaterally alienate orencumber the property, Long v. Earle, supra, at 517, 269N. W., at 581; Rogers v. Rogers, 136 Mich. App. 125, 134, 356N. W. 2d 288, 292 (1984), although this may be accomplishedwith mutual consent, Eadus v. Hunter, 249 Mich. 190, 228N. W. 782 (1930). Divorce ends the tenancy by the entirety, generally giving each spouse an equal interest inthe property as a tenant in common, unless the divorce decree specifies otherwise. Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. $ 552.102(West 1988).In determining whether respondent's husband possessed"property" or "rights to property" within the meaning of 26U. S. C. $ 6321, we look to the individual rights created bythese state law rules. According to Michigan law, respondent's husband had, among other rights, the following rightswith respect to the entireties property: the right to use theproperty, the right to exclude third parties from it, the rightto a share of income produced from it, the right of survivorship, the right to become a tenant in common with equalshares upon divorce, the right to sell the property withthe respondent's consent and to receive half the proceedsfrom such a sale, the right to place an encumbrance on theproperty with the respondent's consent, and the right toblock respondent from selling or encumbering the propertyunilaterally.535US1 Unit: $U39 [09-18-03 17:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN283Cite as: 535 U. S. 274 (2002)Opinion of the CourtIVWe turn now to the federal question of whether the rightsMichigan law granted to respondent's husband as a tenantby the entirety qualify as "property" or "rights to property"under $ 6321. The statutory language authorizing the taxlien "is broad and reveals on its face that Congress meant toreach every interest in property that a taxpayer mighthave." United States v. National Bank of Commerce, 472U. S., at 719-720. "Stronger language could hardly havebeen selected to reveal a purpose to assure the collection oftaxes."Glass City Bank v. United States, 326 U. S. 265,267 (1945). We conclude that the husband's rights in theentireties property fall within this broad statutory language.Michigan law grants a tenant by the entirety some of themost essential property rights: the right to use the property,to receive income produced by it, and to exclude others fromit. See Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U. S. 374, 384 (1994)("[T]he right to exclude others" is " `one of the most essentialsticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly character-ized as property' " (quotingKaiser Aetna v. United States,444 U. S. 164, 176 (1979))); Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419, 435 (1982) (including "use" asone of the "[p]roperty rights in a physical thing"). Theserights alone may be sufficient to subject the husband's inter-est in the entireties property to the federal tax lien. Theygave him a substantial degree of control over the entiretiesproperty, and, as we noted inDrye, "in determining whethera federal taxpayer's state-law rights constitute `property' or`rights to property,' [t]he important consideration is thebreadth of the control the [taxpayer] could exercise over theproperty." 528 U. S., at 61 (some internal quotation marksomitted).The husband's rights in the estate, however, went beyonduse, exclusion, and income. He also possessed the right toalienate (or otherwise encumber) the property with the con-sent of respondent, his wife.Loretto, supra, at 435 (the535US1 Unit: $U39 [09-18-03 17:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN284 UNITED STATES v. CRAFTOpinion of the Courtright to "dispose" of an item is a property right). It is true,as respondent notes, that he lacked the right to unilaterallyalienate the property, a right that is often in the bundle ofproperty rights. See alsopost, at 296-297 (Thomas, J., dissenting). There is no reason to believe, however, that thisone stick--the right of unilateral alienation--is essential tothe category of "property."This Court has already stated that federal tax liens mayattach to property that cannot be unilaterally alienated. InUnited States v. Rodgers, 461 U. S. 677 (1983), we consideredthe Federal Government's power to foreclose homesteadproperty attached by a federal tax lien. Texas law providedthat " `the owner or claimant of the property claimed ashomestead [may not], if married, sell or abandon the homestead without the consent of the other spouse.' " Id., at 684-685 (quoting Tex. Const., Art. 16, $ 50). We nonethelessstated that "[i]n the homestead context . . . , there is nodoubt . . . that not only do both spouses (rather than neither)have an independent interest in the homestead property, butthat a federal tax lien can at least attach to each of thoseinterests." 461 U. S., at 703, n. 31; cf. Drye, supra, at 60,n. 7 (noting that "an interest in a spendthrift trust has beenheld to constitute ` "property" for purposes of $ 6321' eventhough the beneficiary may not transfer that interest tothird parties").Excluding property from a federal tax lien simply becausethe taxpayer does not have the power to unilaterally alienateit would, moreover, exempt a rather large amount of what iscommonly thought of as property. It would exempt not onlythe type of property discussed in Rodgers, but also somecommunity property. Community property States oftenprovide that real community property cannot be alienatedwithout the consent of both spouses. See, e. g., Ariz. Rev.Stat. Ann. $ 25-214(C) (2000); Cal. Fam. Code Ann. $ 1102(West 1994); Idaho Code $ 32-912 (1996); La. Civ. Code Ann.,Art. 2347 (West Supp. 2002); Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 123.230(3)535US1 Unit: $U39 [09-18-03 17:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN285Cite as: 535 U. S. 274 (2002)Opinion of the Court(Supp. 2001); N. M. Stat. Ann. $ 40-3-13 (1999); Wash. Rev.Code $ 26.16.030(3) (1994). Accordingly, the fact that respondent's husband could not unilaterally alienate the prop-erty does not preclude him from possessing "property andrights to property" for the purposes of $ 6321.Respondent's husband also possessed the right of survivorship--the right to automatically inherit the whole of the estate should his wife predecease him. Respondent arguesthat this interest was merely an expectancy, which we suggested in Drye would not constitute "property" for the pur-poses of a federal tax lien. 528 U. S., at 60, n. 7 ("[We donot mean to suggest] that an expectancy that has pecuniaryvalue . . . would fall within $ 6321 prior to the time it ripensinto a present estate"). Drye did not decide this question,however, nor do we need to do so here. As we have discussed above, a number of the sticks in respondent's husband's bundle were presently existing. It is therefore notnecessary to decide whether the right to survivorship alonewould qualify as "property" or "rights to property" under$ 6321.That the rights of respondent's husband in the entiretiesproperty constitute "property" or "rights to property" "belonging to" him is further underscored by the fact that, ifthe conclusion were otherwise, the entireties property wouldbelong to no one for the purposes of $ 6321. Respondent hadno more interest in the property than her husband; if neitherof them had a property interest in the entireties property,who did? This result not only seems absurd, but would alsoallow spouses to shield their property from federal taxationby classifying it as entireties property, facilitating abuse ofthe federal tax system. Johnson, After Drye: The LikelyAttachment of the Federal Tax Lien to Tenancy-by-theEntireties Interests, 75 Ind. L. J. 1163, 1171 (2000).Justice Scalia's and Justice Thomas' dissents claimthat the conclusion that the husband possessed an interestin the entireties property to which the federal tax lien could535US1 Unit: $U39 [09-18-03 17:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN286 UNITED STATES v. CRAFTOpinion of the Courtattach is in conflict with the rules for tax liens relating topartnership property. See post, at 289 (opinion of Scalia,J.); see also post, at 295-296, n. 4 (opinion of Thomas, J.).This is not so. As the authorities cited by Justice Thomasreflect, the federal tax lien does attach to an individual partner's interest in the partnership, that is, to the fair marketvalue of his or her share in the partnership assets. Ibid.(citing B. Bittker & M. McMahon, Federal Income Taxationof Individuals || 44.5[4][a] (2d ed. 1995 and 2000 Cum. Supp.));see also 1 A. Bromberg & L. Ribstein, Partnership $ 3.05(d)(2002-1 Supp.) (hereinafter Bromberg & Ribstein) (citingUniform Partnership Act $ 28, 6 U. L. A. 744 (1995)). As aholder of this lien, the Federal Government is entitled to"receive . . . the profits to which the assigning partner wouldotherwise be entitled," including predissolution distributionsand the proceeds from dissolution. Uniform PartnershipAct $ 27(1), id., at 736.There is, however, a difference between the treatment ofentireties property and partnership assets. The FederalGovernment may not compel the sale of partnership assets(although it may foreclose on the partner's interest, 1 Bromberg & Ribstein $ 3.05(d)(3)(iv)). It is this difference thatis reflected in Justice Scalia's assertion that partnershipproperty cannot be encumbered by an individual partner'sdebts. See post, at 289. This disparity in treatment between the two forms of ownership, however, arises from ourdecision in United States v. Rodgers, supra (holding that theGovernment may foreclose on property even where the coowners lack the right of unilateral alienation), and not ourholding today. In this case, it is instead the dissenters' theory that departs from partnership law, as it would hold thatthe Federal Government's lien does not attach to the husband's interest in the entireties property at all, whereas thelien may attach to an individual's interest in partnershipproperty.535US1 Unit: $U39 [09-18-03 17:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN287Cite as: 535 U. S. 274 (2002)Opinion of the CourtRespondent argues that, whether or not we would con-clude that respondent's husband had an interest in the entireties property, legislative history indicates that Congressdid not intend that a federal tax lien should attach to suchan interest. In 1954, the Senate rejected a proposed amend-ment to the tax lien statute that would have provided thatthe lien attach to "property or rights to property (includingthe interest of such person as tenant by the entirety)."S. Rep. No. 1622, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 575 (1954). We haveelsewhere held, however, that failed legislative proposals are"a particularly dangerous ground on which to rest an interpretation of a prior statute," Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U. S. 633, 650 (1990), reasoningthat " `[c]ongressional inaction lacks persuasive significancebecause several equally tenable inferences may be drawnfrom such inaction, including the inference that the existinglegislation already incorporated the offered change.' " Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 187 (1994). This case exemplifiesthe risk of relying on such legislative history. As we notedin United States v. Rodgers, 461 U. S., at 704, n. 31, somelegislative history surrounding the 1954 amendment indicates that the House intended the amendment to be nothingmore than a "clarification" of existing law, and that the Senate rejected the amendment only because it found it "superfluous." See H. R. Rep. No. 1337, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., A406(1954) (noting that the amendment would "clarif[y] the term`property and rights to property' by expressly includingtherein the interest of the delinquent taxpayer in an estateby the entirety"); S. Rep. No. 1622, at 575 ("It is not clearwhat change in existing law would be made by the parenthetical phrase. The deletion of the phrase is intended tocontinue the existing law").The same ambiguity that plagues the legislative historyaccompanies the common-law background of Congress' enactment of the tax lien statute. Respondent argues that535US1 Unit: $U39 [09-18-03 17:31:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN288 UNITED STATES v. CRAFTOpinion of the CourtCongress could not have intended the passage of the federaltax lien statute to alter the generally accepted rule that lienscould not attach to entireties property. See Astoria Fed.Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U. S. 104, 108 (1991)("[W]here a common-law principle is well established . . . thecourts may take it as given that Congress has legislated withan expectation that the principle will apply except `when astatutory purpose to the contrary is evident' "). Thecommon-law rule was not so well established with respect tothe application of a federal tax lien that we must assumethat Congress considered the impact of its enactment on thequestion now before us. There was not much of a commonlaw background on the question of the application of federaltax liens, as the first court of appeals cases dealing with theapplication of such a lien did not arise until the 1950's.United States v. Hutcherson, 188 F. 2d 326 (CA8 1951); Raffaele v. Granger, 196 F. 2d 620 (CA3 1952). This backgroundis not sufficient to overcome the broad statutory languageCongress did enact, authorizing the lien to attach to "allproperty and rights to property" a taxpayer might have.We therefore conclude that respondent's husband's interestin the entireties property constituted "property" or "rightsto property" for the purposes of the federal tax lien statute.We recognize that Michigan makes a different choice withrespect to state law creditors: "[L]and held by husband andwife as tenants by entirety is not subject to levy under execution on judgment rendered against either husband or wifealone." Sanford v. Bertrau, 204 Mich. 244, 247, 169 N. W.880, 881 (1918). But that by no means dictates our choice.The interpretation of 26 U. S. C. $ 6321 is a federal question,and in answering that question we are in no way bound bystate courts' answers to similar questions involving statelaw. As we elsewhere have held, " `exempt status understate law does not bind the federal collector.' " Drye v.United States, 528 U. S., at 59.

We note,however, that insofar as the amount is dependent uponwhether the 1989 conveyance was fraudulent, see post, at290, n. 1 (Thomas, J., dissenting), this case is somewhatanomalous. The Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court'sjudgment that this conveyance was not fraudulent, and theGovernment has not sought certiorari review of that determination. Since the District Court's judgment was basedon the notion that, because the federal tax lien could notattach to the property, transferring it could not constitute anattempt to evade the Government creditor, 65 F. Supp. 2d,at 657-659, in future cases, the fraudulent conveyance ques-tion will no doubt be answered differently.The judgment of the United States Court of Appealsfor the Sixth Circuit is accordingly reversed, and the case isremanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
