The government must prove beyond a reasonable doubtevery element of a charged offense.In re Winship, 397 U. S.358 (1970). Although this standard is an ancient and honored aspect of our criminal justice system, it defies easy ex-plication. In these cases, we consider the constitutionalityof two attempts to define "reasonable doubt."IThe beyond a reasonable doubt standard is a requirementof due process, but the Constitution neither prohibits trialcourts from defining reasonable doubt nor requires them todo so as a matter of course. Cf. Hopt v. Utah, 120 U. S. 430,440-441 (1887). Indeed, so long as the court instructs thejury on the necessity that the defendant's guilt be provedbeyond a reasonable doubt, see Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S.307, 320, n. 14 (1979), the Constitution does not require thatany particular form of words be used in advising the jury ofthe government's burden of proof. Cf.Taylor v. Kentucky,436 U. S. 478, 485-486 (1978). Rather, "taken as a whole,the instructions [must] correctly conve[y] the concept of rea-sonable doubt to the jury." Holland v. United States, 348U. S. 121, 140 (1954).In only one case have we held that a definition of reasonable doubt violated the Due Process Clause. Cage v. Louisiana, 498 U. S. 39 (1990) (per curiam). There, the jurorswere told:" `[A reasonable doubt] is one that is founded upon a realtangible substantial basis and not upon mere caprice andconjecture. It must be such doubt as would give riseto a grave uncertainty, raised in your mind by reasonsof the unsatisfactory character of the evidence or lackthereof. A reasonable doubt is not a mere possible*Justices Blackmun and Souter join only Part II of this opinion.Justice Ginsburg joins only Parts II, III-B, and IV.511us1$30J 11-03-97 16:58:40 PAGES OPINPGT6 VICTOR v.

What isrequired is not an absolute or mathematical certainty,but a moral certainty.' " Id., at 40 (emphasis added bythis Court in Cage).We held that the highlighted portions of the instructionrendered it unconstitutional:"It is plain to us that the words `substantial' and `grave,'as they are commonly understood, suggest a higher degree of doubt than is required for acquittal under thereasonable doubt standard. When those statements arethen considered with the reference to `moral certainty,'rather than evidentiary certainty, it becomes clear thata reasonable juror could have interpreted the instruction to allow a finding of guilt based on a degree of proofbelow that required by the Due Process Clause." Id.,at 41.In a subsequent case, we made clear that the proper inquiry is not whether the instruction "could have" been applied in an unconstitutional manner, but whether there is areasonable likelihood that the jury did so apply it. Estellev. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 72, and n. 4 (1991). The constitutional question in the present cases, therefore, is whetherthere is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood theinstructions to allow conviction based on proof insufficient tomeet the Winship standard. Although other courts haveheld that instructions similar to those given at petitioners'trials violate the Due Process Clause, see State v. Bryant,334 N. C. 333, 432 S. E. 2d 291 (1993), cert. pending, No.93-753; Morley v. Stenberg, 828 F. Supp. 1413 (Neb. 1993),both the Nebraska and the California Supreme Courts heldthat the instructions were constitutional. We granted certiorari, 509 U. S. 954 (1993), and now affirm both judgments.511us1$30J 11-03-97 16:58:40 PAGES OPINPGT7Cite as: 511 U. S. 1 (1994)Opinion of the CourtIIOn October 14, 1984, petitioner Sandoval shot three men,two of them fatally, in a gang-related incident in LosAngeles. About two weeks later, he entered the home of aman who had given information to the police about the murders and shot him dead; Sandoval then killed the man's wifebecause she had seen him murder her husband. Sandovalwas convicted on four counts of first degree murder. Thejury found that Sandoval personally used a firearm in thecommission of each offense, and found the special circumstance of multiple murder. Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 12022.5(West 1992) and Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 190.2(a)(3) (West1988). He was sentenced to death for murdering the womanand to life in prison without possibility of parole for the otherthree murders. The California Supreme Court affirmed theconvictions and sentences. 4 Cal. 4th 155, 841 P. 2d 862(1992).The jury in Sandoval's case was given the following instruction on the government's burden of proof:"A defendant in a criminal action is presumed to beinnocent until the contrary is proved, and in case of areasonable doubt whether his guilt is satisfactorilyshown, he is entitled to a verdict of not guilty. Thispresumption places upon the State the burden of proving him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt."Reasonable doubt is defined as follows: It is not amere possible doubt; because everything relating tohuman affairs, and depending on moral evidence, is opento some possible or imaginary doubt. It is that state ofthe case which, after the entire comparison and consideration of all the evidence, leaves the minds of the jurorsin that condition that they cannot say they feel an abiding conviction, to a moral certainty, of the truth of thecharge."

It is a term often used,probably pretty well understood, but not easily defined.It is not mere possible doubt; because every thing relating to human affairs, and depending on moral evidence,is open to some possible or imaginary doubt. It is thatstate of the case, which, after the entire comparison andconsideration of all the evidence, leaves the minds of ju-rors in that condition that they cannot say they feel anabiding conviction, to a moral certainty, of the truth ofthe charge. The burden of proof is upon the prosecutor.All the presumptions of law independent of evidence arein favor of innocence; and every person is presumed tobe innocent until he is proved guilty. If upon such proofthere is reasonable doubt remaining, the accused is enti-tled to the benefit of it by an acquittal. For it is notsufficient to establish a probability, though a strong onearising from the doctrine of chances, that the factcharged is more likely to be true than the contrary; butthe evidence must establish the truth of the fact to areasonable and moral certainty; a certainty that convinces and directs the understanding, and satisfies thereason and judgment, of those who are bound to actconscientiously upon it. This we take to be proof beyond reasonable doubt." Commonwealth v. Webster, 59Mass. 295, 320 (1850).The Webster charge is representative of the time when"American courts began applying [the beyond a reasonabledoubt standard] in its modern form in criminal cases."

In People v.Paulsell, 115 Cal. 6, 12, 46 P. 734 (1896), the court cautionedstate trial judges against departing from that formulation.And in 1927, the state legislature adopted the bulk of theWebster instruction as a statutory definition of reasonabledoubt. Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 1096 (West 1985); see California Jury Instructions, Criminal, No. 2.90 (4th ed. 1979). Indeed, the California Legislature has directed that "the courtmay read to the jury section 1096 of this code, and no furtherinstruction on the subject of the presumption of innocenceor defining reasonable doubt need be given." $ 1096a. Thestatutory instruction was given in Sandoval's case.The California instruction was criticized in People v. Brigham, 25 Cal. 3d 283, 292-316, 599 P. 2d 100, 106-121 (1979)(Mosk, J., concurring). Justice Mosk apparently did notthink the instruction was unconstitutional, but he "urge[d]the Legislature to reconsider its codification." Id., at 293,599 P. 2d, at 106. The California Assembly and Senate responded by requesting the committee on jury instructions ofthe Los Angeles Superior Court "to study alternatives tothe definition of `reasonable doubt' set forth in Section 1096of the Penal Code, and to report its findings and recommendations to the Legislature."

NEBRASKAOpinion of the CourtASandoval's primary objection is to the use of the phrases"moral evidence" and "moral certainty" in the instruction.As noted, this part of the charge was lifted verbatim fromChief Justice Shaw's Webster decision; some understanding of the historical context in which that instruction waswritten is accordingly helpful in evaluating its continuingvalidity.By the beginning of the Republic, lawyers had borrowedthe concept of "moral evidence" from the philosophers andhistorians of the 17th and 18th centuries. See generally B.Shapiro, "Beyond Reasonable Doubt" and "Probable Cause":Historical Perspectives on the Anglo-American Law of Evidence, ch. 1 (1991). James Wilson, who was instrumental inframing the Constitution and who served as one of the original Members of this Court, explained in a 1790 lecture onlaw that "evidence . . . is divided into two species--demonstrative and moral." 1 Works of James Wilson 518 (J. Andrews ed. 1896). Wilson went on to explain the distinctionthus:"Demonstrative evidence has for its subject abstractand necessary truths, or the unchangeable relations ofideas. Moral evidence has for its subject the real butcontingent truths and connections, which take placeamong things actually existing. . . .. . . . ."In moral evidence, there not only may be, but theregenerally is, contrariety of proofs: in demonstrative evidence, no such contrariety can take place. . . . [T]o suppose that two contrary demonstrations can exist, is tosuppose that the same proposition is both true and false:which is manifestly absurd. With regard to moral evidence, there is, for the most part, real evidence on bothsides. On both sides, contrary presumptions, contrary511us1$30J 11-03-97 16:58:40 PAGES OPINPGT11Cite as: 511 U. S. 1 (1994)Opinion of the Courttestimonies, contrary experiences must be balanced."Id., at 518-519.A leading 19th century treatise observed that "[m]atters offact are proved by moral evidence alone; . . . [i]n the ordinaryaffairs of life, we do not require demonstrative evidence, . . .and to insist upon it would be unreasonable and absurd." 1S. Greenleaf, Law of Evidence 3-4 (13th ed. 1876).The phrase "moral certainty" shares an epistemologicalpedigree with moral evidence. See generally Shapiro, "ToA Moral Certainty": Theories of Knowledge and AngloAmerican Juries 1600-1850, 38 Hastings L. J. 153 (1986).Moral certainty was the highest degree of certitude based onsuch evidence. In his 1790 lecture, James Wilson observed:"In a series of moral evidence, the inference drawn inthe several steps is not necessary; nor is it impossiblethat the premises should be true, while the conclusiondrawn from them is false.". . . In moral evidence, we rise, by an insensiblegradation, from possibility to probability, and fromprobability to the highest degree of moral certainty."1 Works of James Wilson,supra, at 519.At least one early treatise explicitly equated moral certaintywith proof beyond a reasonable doubt:"Evidence which satisfies the minds of the jury of thetruth of the fact in dispute, to the entire exclusion ofevery reasonable doubt, constitutes full proof of thefact. . . ."Even the most direct evidence can produce nothingmore than such a high degree of probability as amountsto moral certainty. From the highest degree it maydecline, by an infinite number of gradations, untilit produce in the mind nothing more than a mere pre-ponderance of assent in favour of the particular fact."T. Starkie, Law of Evidence 478 (2d ed. 1833).511us1$30J 11-03-97 16:58:40 PAGES OPINPGT12 VICTOR v. NEBRASKAOpinion of the CourtSee also Greenleaf, supra, at 4 ("The most that can be affirmed of [things proved by moral evidence] is, that there isno reasonable doubt concerning them").Thus, when Chief Justice Shaw penned the Webster instruction in 1850, moral certainty meant a state of subjectivecertitude about some event or occurrence. As the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court subsequently explained:"Proof `beyond a reasonable doubt' . . . is proof `to amoral certainty,' as distinguished from an absolute certainty. As applied to a judicial trial for crime, the twophrases are synonymous and equivalent; each has beenused by eminent judges to explain the other; and eachsignifies such proof as satisfies the judgment and consciences of the jury, as reasonable men, and applyingtheir reason to the evidence before them, that the crimecharged has been committed by the defendant, and sosatisfies them as to leave no other reasonable conclusionpossible." Commonwealth v. Costley, 118 Mass. 1, 24(1875).Indeed, we have said that "[p]roof to a `moral certainty'is an equivalent phrase with `beyond a reasonable doubt.' "Fidelity Mut. Life Assn. v. Mettler, 185 U. S. 308, 317 (1902),citing Commonwealth v. Costley, supra. See also Wilson v.United States, 232 U. S. 563, 570 (1914) (approving reasonable doubt instruction cast in terms of moral certainty);Miles v. United States, 103 U. S. 304, 309, 312 (1881).We recognize that the phrase "moral evidence" is not amainstay of the modern lexicon, though we do not think itmeans anything different today than it did in the 19th century. The few contemporary dictionaries that define moralevidence do so consistently with its original meaning. See,e. g., Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary 1168 (2ded. 1979) ("based on general observation of people, etc.rather than on what is demonstrable"); Collins English Dic511us1$30J 11-03-97 16:58:40 PAGES OPINPGT13Cite as: 511 U. S. 1 (1994)Opinion of the Courttionary 1014 (3d ed. 1991) (similar); 9 Oxford English Diction-ary 1070 (2d ed. 1989) (similar).Moreover, the instruction itself gives a definition of thephrase. The jury was told that "everything relating tohuman affairs, and depending on moral evidence, is open tosome possible or imaginary doubt"--in other words, that ab-solute certainty is unattainable in matters relating to humanaffairs. Moral evidence, in this sentence, can only mean em-pirical evidence offered to prove such matters--the proof introduced at trial.This conclusion is reinforced by other instructions givenin Sandoval's case. The judge informed the jurors that theirduty was "to determine the facts of the case from the evidence received in the trial and not from any other source."Sandoval App. 38. The judge continued: "Evidence consistsof testimony of witnesses, writings, material objects, or anything presented to the senses and offered to prove the existence or non-existence of a fact." Id., at 40. The judge alsotold the jurors that "you must not be influenced by pity fora defendant or by prejudice against him," and that "[y]oumust not be swayed by mere sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public opinion or public feeling."Id., at 39. These instructions correctly pointed the jurors'attention to the facts of the case before them, not (as Sandoval contends) the ethics or morality of Sandoval's criminalacts. Accordingly, we find the reference to moral evidenceunproblematic.We are somewhat more concerned with Sandoval's argument that the phrase "moral certainty" has lost its historicalmeaning, and that a modern jury would understand it toallow conviction on proof that does not meet the beyond areasonable doubt standard. Words and phrases can changemeaning over time: A passage generally understood in 1850may be incomprehensible or confusing to a modern juror.And although some contemporary dictionaries contain definitions of moral certainty similar to the 19th century under511us1$30J 11-03-97 16:58:40 PAGES OPINPGT14 VICTOR v. NEBRASKAOpinion of the Courtstanding of the phrase, see Webster's Third New Inter-national Dictionary 1468 (1981) ("virtual rather than actual, immediate, or completely demonstrable"); 9 Oxford Eng-lish Dictionary,supra, at 1070 ("a degree of probability sogreat as to admit of no reasonable doubt"), we are willing toaccept Sandoval's premise that "moral certainty," standingalone, might not be recognized by modern jurors as a synonym for "proof beyond a reasonable doubt." But it doesnot necessarily follow that the California instruction isunconstitutional.Sandoval first argues that moral certainty would be understood by modern jurors to mean a standard of proof lowerthan beyond a reasonable doubt. In support of this proposition, Sandoval points to contemporary dictionaries that define moral certainty in terms of probability. E. g., Webster'sNew Twentieth Century Dictionary, supra, at 1168 ("basedon strong probability"); Random House Dictionary of theEnglish Language 1249 (2d ed. 1983) ("resting upon convincing grounds of probability"). But the beyond a reasonabledoubt standard is itself probabilistic. "[I]n a judicial proceeding in which there is a dispute about the facts of someearlier event, the factfinder cannot acquire unassailably accurate knowledge of what happened. Instead, all the factfinder can acquire is a belief of what probably happened."In re Winship, 397 U. S., at 370 (Harlan, J., concurring) (emphasis in original). The problem is not that moral certaintymay be understood in terms of probability, but that a jurymight understand the phrase to mean something less thanthe very high level of probability required by the Constitution in criminal cases.Although in this respect moral certainty is ambiguous inthe abstract, the rest of the instruction given in Sandoval'scase lends content to the phrase. The jurors were told thatthey must have "an abiding conviction, to a moral certainty,of the truth of the charge." Sandoval App. 49. An instruction cast in terms of an abiding conviction as to guilt, without511us1$30J 11-03-97 16:58:40 PAGES OPINPGT15Cite as: 511 U. S. 1 (1994)Opinion of the Courtreference to moral certainty, correctly states the government's burden of proof. Hopt v. Utah, 120 U. S., at 439("The word `abiding' here has the signification of settled andfixed, a conviction which may follow a careful examinationand comparison of the whole evidence"); see Criminal JuryInstructions: District of Columbia 46 (3d H. Greene & T.Guidoboni ed. 1978). And the judge had already informedthe jury that matters relating to human affairs are provedby moral evidence, see supra, at 13; giving the same meaningto the word moral in this part of the instruction, moral certainty can only mean certainty with respect to human affairs.As used in this instruction, therefore, we are satisfied thatthe reference to moral certainty, in conjunction with theabiding conviction language, "impress[ed] upon the factfinderthe need to reach a subjective state of near certitude of theguilt of the accused." Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S., at 315.Accordingly, we reject Sandoval's contention that the moralcertainty element of the California instruction invited thejury to convict him on proof below that required by the DueProcess Clause.Sandoval's second argument is a variant of the first. Accepting that the instruction requires a high level of confidence in the defendant's guilt, Sandoval argues that a jurormight be convinced to a moral certainty that the defendantis guilty even though the government has failed to provehis guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. A definition of moralcertainty in a widely used modern dictionary lends supportto this argument, see American Heritage Dictionary 1173 (3ded. 1992) ("Based on strong likelihood or firm conviction,rather than on the actual evidence"), and we do not gainsayits force. As we have noted, "[t]he constitutional standardrecognized in the Winship case was expressly phrased as onethat protects an accused against a conviction except on `proofbeyond a reasonable doubt.' " Jackson v. Virginia, supra,at 315 (emphasis in original). Indeed, in Cage we contrasted511us1$30J 11-03-97 16:58:40 PAGES OPINPGT16 VICTOR v. NEBRASKAOpinion of the Court"moral certainty" with "evidentiary certainty." 498 U. S.,at 41.But the moral certainty language cannot be sequesteredfrom its surroundings. In theCage instruction, the jurorswere simply told that they had to be morally certain of thedefendant's guilt; there was nothing else in the instructionto lend meaning to the phrase. Not so here. The jury inSandoval's case was told that a reasonable doubt is "thatstate of the case which,after the entire comparison and consideration of all the evidence, leaves the minds of the jurorsin that condition that they cannot say they feel an abidingconviction, to a moral certainty, of the truth of the charge."Sandoval App. 49 (emphasis added). The instruction thusexplicitly told the jurors that their conclusion had to be basedon the evidence in the case. Other instructions reinforcedthis message. The jury was told "to determine the facts ofthe case from the evidence received in the trial and not fromany other source." Id., at 38. The judge continued that"you must not be influenced by pity for a defendant or byprejudice against him. . . . You must not be swayed by meresentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, publicopinion or public feeling." Id., at 39. Accordingly, there isno reasonable likelihood that the jury would have understoodmoral certainty to be disassociated from the evidence in thecase.We do not think it reasonably likely that the jury understood the words "moral certainty" either as suggesting astandard of proof lower than due process requires or asallowing conviction on factors other than the government'sproof. At the same time, however, we do not condone theuse of the phrase. As modern dictionary definitions ofmoral certainty attest, the common meaning of the phrasehas changed since it was used in the Webster instruction, andit may continue to do so to the point that it conflicts withthe Winship standard. Indeed, the definitions of reasonabledoubt most widely used in the federal courts do not contain511us1$30J 11-03-97 16:58:40 PAGES OPINPGT17Cite as: 511 U. S. 1 (1994)Opinion of the Courtany reference to moral certainty. See Federal Judicial Cen-ter, Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions 28 (1988); 1 E. Devitt & C. Blackmar, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions$ 11.14 (3d ed. 1977). But we have no supervisory powerover the state courts, and in the context of the instructionsas a whole we cannot say that the use of the phrase renderedthe instruction given in Sandoval's case unconstitutional.BFinally, Sandoval objects to the portion of the charge inwhich the judge instructed the jury that a reasonable doubtis "not a mere possible doubt." The Cage instruction in-cluded an almost identical reference to "not a mere possibledoubt," but we did not intimate that there was anythingwrong with that part of the charge. See 498 U. S., at 40.That is because "[a] `reasonable doubt,' at a minimum, is onebased upon `reason.' "Jackson v. Virginia, supra, at 317.A fanciful doubt is not a reasonable doubt. As Sandoval'sdefense attorney told the jury: "Anything can be possible. . . . [A] planet could be made out of blue cheese. But that'sreally not in the realm of what we're talking about." Sando-val App. 79 (excerpt from closing argument). That this isthe sense in which the instruction uses "possible" is madeclear from the final phrase of the sentence, which notes thateverything "is open to some possible or imaginary doubt."We therefore reject Sandoval's challenge to this portion ofthe instruction as well. IIIOn December 26, 1987, petitioner Victor went to theOmaha home of an 82-year-old woman for whom he occasionally did gardening work. Once inside, he beat her with apipe and cut her throat with a knife, killing her. Victor wasconvicted of first degree murder. A three-judge panel foundthe statutory aggravating circumstances that Victor hadpreviously been convicted of murder, Neb. Rev. Stat. $ 29-2523(1)(a) (1989), and that the murder in this case was espe511us1$30J 11-03-97 16:58:40 PAGES OPINPGT18 VICTOR v. NEBRASKAOpinion of the Courtcially heinous, atrocious, and cruel, $ 29-2523(1)(d). Findingnone of the statutory mitigating circumstances, the panelsentenced Victor to death. The Nebraska Supreme Courtaffirmed the conviction and sentence.State v. Victor, 235Neb. 770, 457 N. W. 2d 431 (1990), cert. denied, 498 U. S.1127 (1991).At Victor's trial, the judge instructed the jury that "[t]heburden is always on the State to prove beyond a reasonabledoubt all of the material elements of the crime charged, andthis burden never shifts." App. in No. 92-8894, p. 8 (VictorApp.). The charge continued:" `Reasonable doubt' is such a doubt as would cause areasonable and prudent person, in one of the graver andmore important transactions of life, to pause and hesi-tate before taking the represented facts as true and relying and acting thereon. It is such a doubt as will notpermit you, after full, fair, and impartial considerationof all the evidence, to have an abiding conviction, to amoral certainty, of the guilt of the accused. At thesame time, absolute or mathematical certainty is not required. You may be convinced of the truth of a factbeyond a reasonable doubt and yet be fully aware thatpossibly you may be mistaken. You may find an ac-cused guilty upon thestrong probabilities of the case,provided such probabilities are strong enough to excludeany doubt of his guilt that is reasonable. A reasonabledoubt is an actual and substantial doubt reasonablyarising from the evidence, from the facts or circum-stances shown by the evidence, or from the lack of evidence on the part of the State, as distinguished from adoubt arising from mere possibility, from bare imagination, or from fanciful conjecture." Id., at 11 (emphasisadded).On state postconviction review, the Nebraska SupremeCourt rejected Victor's contention that the instruction, par511us1$30J 11-03-97 16:58:40 PAGES OPINPGT19Cite as: 511 U. S. 1 (1994)Opinion of the Courtticularly the emphasized phrases, violated the Due ProcessClause. 242 Neb. 306, 310-311, 494 N. W. 2d 565, 569 (1993).Because the last state court in which review could be hadconsidered Victor's constitutional claim on the merits, it isproperly presented for our review despite Victor's failure toobject to the instruction at trial or raise the issue on directappeal. See, e. g., Ylst v. Nunnemaker, 501 U. S. 797, 801(1991).The instruction given in Victor's case can be traced totwo separate lines of cases. Much of the charge is takenfrom Chief Justice Shaw's Webster instruction. See Carrv.State, 23 Neb. 749, 752-753, 37 N. W. 630, 631-632 (1888)(approving the use ofWebster). The rest derives from aseries of decisions approving instructions cast in terms ofan "actual doubt" that would cause a reasonable person tohesitate to act. See, e. g., Whitney v. State, 53 Neb. 287,298, 73 N. W. 696, 699 (1898); Willis v. State, 43 Neb. 102,110-111, 61 N. W. 254, 256 (1894); Polin v. State, 14 Neb.540, 546-547, 16 N. W. 898, 900-901 (1883). In 1968, acommittee appointed by the Nebraska Supreme Court developed model jury instructions; a court rule in effect at thetime Victor was tried directed that those instructions wereto be used where applicable. Nebraska Jury Instructions ix(1969) (N. J. I.). The model instruction on reasonable doubt,N. J. I. 14.08, is the one given at Victor's trial. (Since Victorwas tried, a revised reasonable doubt instruction, N. J. I. 2dCrim. 2.0 (1992), has been adopted, although the prior ver-sion may still be used.)AVictor's primary argument is that equating a reasonabledoubt with a "substantial doubt" overstated the degree ofdoubt necessary for acquittal. We agree that this construc-tion is somewhat problematic. On the one hand, "substantial" means "not seeming or imaginary"; on the other, itmeans "that specified to a large degree." Webster's ThirdNew International Dictionary, at 2280. The former is un511us1$30J 11-03-97 16:58:40 PAGES OPINPGT20 VICTOR v. NEBRASKAOpinion of the Courtexceptionable, as it informs the jury only that a reasonabledoubt is something more than a speculative one; but the latter could imply a doubt greater than required for acquittalunderWinship. Any ambiguity, however, is removed byreading the phrase in the context of the sentence in which itappears: "A reasonable doubt is an actual and substantialdoubt . . .as distinguished from a doubt arising from merepossibility, from bare imagination, or from fanciful conjec-ture." Victor App. 11 (emphasis added).This explicit distinction between a substantial doubt anda fanciful conjecture was not present in theCage instruction.We did say in that case that "the words `substantial' and`grave,' as they are commonly understood, suggest a higherdegree of doubt than is required for acquittal under the reasonable doubt standard." 498 U. S., at 41. But we did nothold that the reference to substantial doubt alone was sufficient to render the instruction unconstitutional. Cf. Taylorv. Kentucky, 436 U. S., at 488 (defining reasonable doubt as asubstantial doubt, "though perhaps not in itself reversibleerror, often has been criticized as confusing") (emphasisadded). Rather, we were concerned that the jury wouldinterpret the term "substantial doubt" in parallel with thepreceding reference to "grave uncertainty," leading to anoverstatement of the doubt necessary to acquit. In theinstruction given in Victor's case, the context makes clearthat "substantial" is used in the sense of existence ratherthan magnitude of the doubt, so the same concern is notpresent.In any event, the instruction provided an alternative definition of reasonable doubt: a doubt that would cause a reasonable person to hesitate to act. This is a formulation wehave repeatedly approved, Holland v. United States, 348U. S., at 140; cf. Hopt v. Utah, 120 U. S., at 439-441, and tothe extent the word "substantial" denotes the quantum ofdoubt necessary for acquittal, the hesitate to act standardgives a commonsense benchmark for just how substantial511us1$30J 11-03-97 16:58:40 PAGES OPINPGT21Cite as: 511 U. S. 1 (1994)Opinion of the Courtsuch a doubt must be. We therefore do not think it reason-ably likely that the jury would have interpreted this instruction to indicate that the doubt must be anything other thana reasonable one.BVictor also challenges the "moral certainty" portion of theinstruction. In another case involving an identical instruction, the Nebraska Supreme Court distinguished Cage as fol-lows: "[U]nder theCage instruction a juror is to vote forconviction unless convinced to a moral certainty that thereexists a reasonable doubt, whereas under the questioned in-struction a juror is to vote for acquittal unless convinced toa moral certainty that no reasonable doubt exists." State v.Morley, 239 Neb. 141, 155, 474 N. W. 2d 660, 670 (1991); seealso 242 Neb., at 310-311, 494 N. W. 2d, at 569 (relying onMorley). We disagree with this reading of Cage. Themoral certainty to which theCage instruction referred wasclearly related to the defendant's guilt; the problem in Cagewas that the rest of the instruction provided insufficient con-text to lend meaning to the phrase. But the Nebraska instruction is not similarly deficient.Instructing the jurors that they must have an abiding conviction of the defendant's guilt does much to alleviate anyconcerns that the phrase "moral certainty" might be misunderstood in the abstract. See supra, at 14-15. The instruc-tion also equated a doubt sufficient to preclude moral certainty with a doubt that would cause a reasonable person tohesitate to act. In other words, a juror morally certain of afact would not hesitate to rely on it; and such a fact can fairlybe said to have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Cf.Hopt v. Utah, supra, at 439-440. The jurors were told thatthey must be convinced of Victor's guilt "after full, fair, andimpartial consideration of all the evidence." Victor App. 11.The judge also told them: "In determining any questions offact presented in this case, you should be governed solely bythe evidence introduced before you. You should not indulge511us1$30J 11-03-97 16:58:40 PAGES OPINPGT22 VICTOR v. NEBRASKAOpinion of the Courtin speculation, conjectures, or inferences not supported bythe evidence."Id., at 2. There is accordingly no reasonable likelihood that the jurors understood the reference tomoral certainty to allow conviction on a standard insufficientto satisy Winship, or to allow conviction on factors otherthan the government's proof. Though we reiterate that wedo not countenance its use, the inclusion of the "moral certainty" phrase did not render the instruction given in Victor's case unconstitutional.CFinally, Victor argues that the reference to "strong probabilities" in the instruction unconstitutionally understated thegovernment's burden. But in the same sentence, the instruction informs the jury that the probabilities must bestrong enough to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. We upheld a nearly identical instruction inDunbar v. United States, 156 U. S. 185, 199 (1895): "Whileit is true that [the challenged instruction] used the words`probabilities' and `strong probabilities,' yet it emphasizedthe fact that those probabilities must be so strong as to exclude any reasonable doubt, and that is unquestionably thelaw" (citing Hopt v. Utah, supra, at 439). That conclusionhas lost no force in the course of a century, and we thereforeconsider Dunbar controlling on this point.IVThe Due Process Clause requires the government to provea criminal defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, andtrial courts must avoid defining reasonable doubt so as tolead the jury to convict on a lesser showing than due processrequires. In these cases, however, we conclude that "takenas a whole, the instructions correctly conveyed the conceptof reasonable doubt to the jury." Holland v. United States,supra, at 140.
