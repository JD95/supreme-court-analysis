S. 569 (1998)Opinion of the Courtpeals' determination that $ 954(d)(1), on its face, impermissibly discriminates on the basis of viewpoint and is void forvagueness under the First and Fifth Amendments. We conclude that $ 954(d)(1) is facially valid, as it neither inherentlyinterferes with First Amendment rights nor violates constitutional vagueness principles.IAWith the establishment of the NEA in 1965, Congress embarked on a "broadly conceived national policy of support forthe . . . arts in the United States," see $ 953(b), pledgingfederal funds to "help create and sustain not only a climateencouraging freedom of thought, imagination, and inquirybut also the material conditions facilitating the release of . . .creative talent." $ 951(7). The enabling statute vests theNEA with substantial discretion to award grants; it identifies only the broadest funding priorities, including "artistic and cultural significance, giving emphasis to Americancreativity and cultural diversity," "professional excellence," and the encouragement of "public knowledge, education, understanding, and appreciation of the arts." See$$ 954(c)(1)-(10).Applications for NEA funding are initially reviewed byadvisory panels composed of experts in the relevant field ofthe arts. Under the 1990 amendments to the enabling statute, those panels must reflect "diverse artistic and culturalpoints of view" and include "wide geographic, ethnic, andminority representation," as well as "lay individuals who areknowledgeable about the arts." $$ 959(c)(1)-(2). The panels report to the 26-member National Council on the Arts(Council), which, in turn, advises the NEA Chairperson.The Chairperson has the ultimate authority to award grantsbut may not approve an application as to which the Councilhas made a negative recommendation. $ 955(f ).524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN574 NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR ARTS v. FINLEYOpinion of the CourtSince 1965, the NEA has distributed over $3 billion ingrants to individuals and organizations, funding that hasserved as a catalyst for increased state, corporate, and foun-dation support for the arts. Congress has recently restricted the availability of federal funding for individualartists, confining grants primarily to qualifying organiza-tions and state arts agencies, and constraining subgranting.See Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appro-priations Act, 1998, $ 329, 111 Stat. 1600. By far the largestportion of the grants distributed in fiscal year 1998 wereawarded directly to state arts agencies. In the remainingcategories, the most substantial grants were allocated tosymphony orchestras, fine arts museums, dance theater foundations, and opera associations. See National Endowmentfor the Arts, FY 1998 Grants, Creation & Presentation 5-8,21, 20, 27.Throughout the NEA's history, only a handful of theagency's roughly 100,000 awards have generated formal complaints about misapplied funds or abuse of the public's trust.Two provocative works, however, prompted public controversy in 1989 and led to congressional revaluation of theNEA's funding priorities and efforts to increase oversight ofits grant-making procedures. The Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania had used $30,000of a visual arts grant it received from the NEA to fund a1989 retrospective of photographer Robert Mapplethorpe'swork. The exhibit, entitled The Perfect Moment, includedhomoerotic photographs that several Members of Congresscondemned as pornographic. See, e. g., 135 Cong. Rec. 22372(1989). Members also denounced artist Andres Serrano'swork Piss Christ, a photograph of a crucifix immersed inurine. See, e. g., id., at 9789. Serrano had been awarded a$15,000 grant from the Southeast Center for ContemporaryArt, an organization that received NEA support.When considering the NEA's appropriations for fiscal year1990, Congress reacted to the controversy surrounding the524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN575Cite as: 524 U. S. 569 (1998)Opinion of the CourtMapplethorpe and Serrano photographs by eliminating$45,000 from the agency's budget, the precise amount contributed to the two exhibits by NEA grant recipients. Congress also enacted an amendment providing that no NEAfunds "may be used to promote, disseminate, or producematerials which in the judgment of [the NEA] may beconsidered obscene, including but not limited to, depictionsof sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation ofchildren, or individuals engaged in sex acts and which, whentaken as a whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value." Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1990, 103 Stat. 738-742.The NEA implemented Congress' mandate by instituting arequirement that all grantees certify in writing that theywould not utilize federal funding to engage in projects inconsistent with the criteria in the 1990 appropriations bill.That certification requirement was subsequently invalidatedas unconstitutionally vague by a Federal District Court,see Bella Lewitzky Dance Foundation v. Frohnmayer, 754F. Supp. 774 (CD Cal. 1991), and the NEA did not appealthe decision.In the 1990 appropriations bill, Congress also agreed tocreate an Independent Commission of constitutional lawscholars to review the NEA's grant-making procedures andassess the possibility of more focused standards for publicarts funding. The Commission's report, issued in September 1990, concluded that there is no constitutional obligationto provide arts funding, but also recommended that the NEArescind the certification requirement and cautioned againstlegislation setting forth any content restrictions. Instead,the Commission suggested procedural changes to enhancethe role of advisory panels and a statutory reaffirmation of"the high place the nation accords to the fostering of mutualrespect for the disparate beliefs and values among us."

FINLEYOpinion of the Courttional Endowment for the Arts 83-91 (Sept. 1990), 3 Record,Doc. No. 51, Exh. K (hereinafter Report to Congress).Informed by the Commission's recommendations, and cog-nizant of pending judicial challenges to the funding limitations in the 1990 appropriations bill, Congress debated sev-eral proposals to reform the NEA's grant-making processwhen it considered the agency's reauthorization in the fallof 1990. The House rejected the Crane Amendment, whichwould have virtually eliminated the NEA, see 136 Cong.Rec. 28656-28657 (1990), and the Rohrabacher Amendment,which would have introduced a prohibition on awarding anygrants that could be used to "promote, distribute, disseminate, or produce matter that has the purpose or effect ofdenigrating the beliefs, tenets, or objects of a particular religion" or "of denigrating an individual, or group of individuals,on the basis of race, sex, handicap, or national origin,"id.,at 28657-28664. Ultimately, Congress adopted the Williams/Coleman Amendment, a bipartisan compromise betweenMembers opposing any funding restrictions and those favoring some guidance to the agency. In relevant part, theAmendment became $ 954(d)(1), which directs the Chairperson, in establishing procedures to judge the artistic meritof grant applications, to "tak[e] into consideration generalstandards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs andvalues of the American public." **Title 20 U. S. C. $ 954(d) provides in full that:"No payment shall be made under this section except upon applicationtherefor which is submitted to the National Endowment for the Arts inaccordance with regulations issued and procedures established by theChairperson. In establishing such regulations and procedures, the Chairperson shall ensure that--"(1) artistic excellence and artistic merit are the criteria by which applications are judged, taking into consideration general standards of decencyand respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public; and"(2) applications are consistent with the purposes of this section. Suchregulations and procedures shall clearly indicate that obscenity is withoutartistic merit, is not protected speech, and shall not be funded."524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN577Cite as: 524 U. S. 569 (1998)Opinion of the CourtThe NEA has not promulgated any official interpretationof the provision, but in December 1990, the Council unanimously adopted a resolution to implement $ 954(d)(1) merelyby ensuring that the members of the advisory panels thatconduct the initial review of grant applications representgeographic, ethnic, and esthetic diversity. See Minutes ofthe Dec. 1990 Retreat of the National Council on the Arts,reprinted in App. 12-13; Transcript of the Dec. 1990 Retreatof the National Council on the Arts, reprinted in id., at 32-33. John Frohnmayer, then Chairperson of the NEA, alsodeclared that he would "count on [the] procedures" ensuringdiverse membership on the peer review panels to fulfill Congress' mandate. See id., at 40.BThe four individual respondents in this case, Karen Finley,John Fleck, Holly Hughes, and Tim Miller, are performanceartists who applied for NEA grants before $ 954(d)(1) wasenacted. An advisory panel recommended approval of respondents' projects, both initially and after receiving Frohn-mayer's request to reconsider three of the applications. Amajority of the Council subsequently recommended disap-proval, and in June 1990, the NEA informed respondentsthat they had been denied funding. Respondents filed suit,alleging that the NEA had violated their First Amendmentrights by rejecting the applications on political grounds, hadfailed to follow statutory procedures by basing the denial oncriteria other than those set forth in the NEA's enablingstatute, and had breached the confidentiality of their grantapplications through the release of quotations to the press,in violation of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U. S. C. $ 552(a).Respondents sought restoration of the recommended grantsor reconsideration of their applications, as well as damagesfor the alleged Privacy Act violations. When Congressenacted $ 954(d)(1), respondents, now joined by the NationalAssociation of Artists' Organizations (NAAO), amended524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN578 NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR ARTS v. FINLEYOpinion of the Courttheir complaint to challenge the provision as void for vague-ness and impermissibly viewpoint based. First AmendedComplaint || 1.The District Court denied the NEA's motion for judgmenton the pleadings, 795 F. Supp. 1457, 1463-1468 (CD Cal.1992), and, after discovery, the NEA agreed to settle theindividual respondents' statutory and as-applied constitutional claims by paying the artists the amount of the vetoedgrants, damages, and attorney's fees. See Stipulation andSettlement Agreement, 6 Record, Doc. No. 128, pp. 3-5.The District Court then granted summary judgment infavor of respondents on their facial constitutional challengeto $ 954(d)(1) and enjoined enforcement of the provision.See 795 F. Supp., at 1476. The court rejected the argumentthat the NEA could comply with $ 954(d)(1) by structuringthe grant selection process to provide for diverse advisorypanels. Id., at 1471. The provision, the court stated, "failsadequately to notify applicants of what is required of them orto circumscribe NEA discretion." Id., at 1472. Reasoningthat "the very nature of our pluralistic society is that thereare an infinite number of values and beliefs, and correlatively,there may be no national `general standards of decency,' "the court concluded that $ 954(d)(1) "cannot be given effectconsistent with the Fifth Amendment's due process requirement." Id., at 1471-1472 (citing Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 108-109 (1972)). Drawing an analogy between arts funding and public universities, the court furtherruled that the First Amendment constrains the NEA'sgrant-making process, and that because $ 954(d)(1) "clearlyreaches a substantial amount of protected speech," it isimpermissibly overbroad on its face. 795 F. Supp., at 1476.The Government did not seek a stay of the District Court'sinjunction, and consequently the NEA has not applied$ 954(d)(1) since June 1992.A divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's ruling. 100 F. 3d 671 (CA9 1996). The major524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN579Cite as: 524 U. S. 569 (1998)Opinion of the Courtity agreed with the District Court that the NEA was com-pelled by the adoption of $ 954(d)(1) to alter its grant-makingprocedures to ensure that applications are judged accordingto the "decency and respect" criteria. The Chairperson, thecourt reasoned, "has no discretion to ignore this obligation,enforce only part of it, or give it a cramped construction."Id., at 680. Concluding that the "decency and respect" criteria are not "susceptible to objective definition," the courtheld that $ 954(d)(1) "gives rise to the danger of arbitraryand discriminatory application" and is void for vaguenessunder the First and Fifth Amendments.Id., at 680-681.In the alternative, the court ruled that $ 954(d)(1) violatesthe First Amendment's prohibition on viewpoint-based restrictions on protected speech. Government funding of thearts, the court explained, is both a "traditional sphere of freeexpression," Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173, 200 (1991), andan area in which the Government has stated its intentionto "encourage a diversity of views from private speakers,"Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S.819, 834 (1995). 100 F. 3d, at 681-682. Accordingly, findingthat $ 954(d)(1) "has a speech-based restriction as its sole rationale and operative principle," Rosenberger, supra, at 834,and noting the NEA's failure to articulate a compelling interest for the provision, the court declared it facially invalid.100 F. 3d, at 683.The dissent asserted that the First Amendment protectsartists' rights to express themselves as indecently and disrespectfully as they like, but does not compel the Governmentto fund that speech. Id., at 684 (opinion of Kleinfeld, J.).The challenged provision, the dissent contended, did not prohibit the NEA from funding indecent or offensive art, butmerely required the agency to consider the "decency and respect" criteria in the grant selection process. Id., at 689-690. Moreover, according to the dissent's reasoning, thevagueness principles applicable to the direct regulation ofspeech have no bearing on the selective award of prizes, and524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN580 NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR ARTS v. FINLEYOpinion of the Courtthe Government may draw distinctions based on content andviewpoint in making its funding decisions. Id., at 684-688.Three judges dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc,maintaining that the panel's decision gave the statute an "implausible construction," applied the " `void for vagueness'doctrine where it does not belong," and extended "FirstAmendment principles to a situation that the First Amend-ment doesn't cover." 112 F. 3d 1015, 1016-1017 (CA9 1997).We granted certiorari, 522 U. S. 991 (1997), and nowreverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.IIARespondents raise a facial constitutional challenge to$ 954(d)(1), and consequently they confront "a heavy burden"in advancing their claim. Rust, supra, at 183. Facial inval-idation "is, manifestly, strong medicine" that "has been employed by the Court sparingly and only as a last resort."Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 613 (1973); see alsoFW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, 223 (1990) (noting that"facial challenges to legislation are generally disfavored").To prevail, respondents must demonstrate a substantial riskthat application of the provision will lead to the suppressionof speech. SeeBroadrick, supra, at 615.Respondents argue that the provision is a paradigmaticexample of viewpoint discrimination because it rejects anyartistic speech that either fails to respect mainstream valuesor offends standards of decency. The premise of respond-ents' claim is that $ 954(d)(1) constrains the agency's abilityto fund certain categories of artistic expression. The NEA,however, reads the provision as merely hortatory, and contends that it stops well short of an absolute restriction. Sec-tion 954(d)(1) adds "considerations" to the grant-makingprocess; it does not preclude awards to projects that mightbe deemed "indecent" or "disrespectful," nor place conditionson grants, or even specify that those factors must be given524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN581Cite as: 524 U. S. 569 (1998)Opinion of the Courtany particular weight in reviewing an application. Indeed,the agency asserts that it has adequately implemented$ 954(d)(1) merely by ensuring the representation of variousbackgrounds and points of view on the advisory panels thatanalyze grant applications. See Declaration of RandolphMcAusland, Deputy Chairman for Programs at the NEA, re-printed in App. 79 (stating that the NEA implements theprovision "by ensuring that the peer review panels representa variety of geographical areas, aesthetic views, professions,areas of expertise, races and ethnic groups, and gender, andinclude a lay person"). We do not decide whether the NEA'sview--that the formulation of diverse advisory panels is sufficient to comply with Congress' command--is in fact a reasonable reading of the statute. It is clear, however, that thetext of $ 954(d)(1) imposes no categorical requirement. Theadvisory language stands in sharp contrast to congressionalefforts to prohibit the funding of certain classes of speech.When Congress has in fact intended to affirmatively constrain the NEA's grant-making authority, it has done so inno uncertain terms. See $ 954(d)(2) ("[O]bscenity is withoutartistic merit, is not protected speech, and shall not befunded").Furthermore, like the plain language of $ 954(d), the political context surrounding the adoption of the "decency and respect" clause is inconsistent with respondents' assertion thatthe provision compels the NEA to deny funding on the basisof viewpoint discriminatory criteria. The legislation was abipartisan proposal introduced as a counterweight to amendments aimed at eliminating the NEA's funding or substantially constraining its grant-making authority. See, e. g., 136Cong. Rec. 28626, 28632, 28634 (1990). The IndependentCommission had cautioned Congress against the adoption ofdistinct viewpoint-based standards for funding, and the Commission's report suggests that "additional criteria for selection, if any, should be incorporated as part of the selectionprocess (perhaps as part of a definition of `artistic excel524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN582 NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR ARTS v. FINLEYOpinion of the Courtlence'), rather than isolated and treated as exogenous consid-erations." Report to Congress 89. In keeping with thatrecommendation, the criteria in $ 954(d)(1) inform the assess-ment of artistic merit, but Congress declined to disallow anyparticular viewpoints. As the sponsors of $ 954(d)(1) notedin urging rejection of the Rohrabacher Amendment: "[I]f westart down that road of prohibiting categories of expression,categories which are indeed constitutionally protectedspeech, where do we end? Where one Member's aversionsend, others with different sensibilities and with different val-ues begin." 136 Cong. Rec. 28624 (statement of Rep. Coleman); see also id., at 28663 (statement of Rep. Williams) (arguing that the Rohrabacher Amendment would prevent thefunding of Jasper Johns' flag series, The Merchant of Venice,Chorus Line, Birth of a Nation, and the Grapes of Wrath).In contrast, before the vote on $ 954(d)(1), one of its sponsorsstated: "If we have done one important thing in this amendment, it is this. We have maintained the integrity of freedom of expression in the United States." Id., at 28674.That $ 954(d)(1) admonishes the NEA merely to take "decency and respect" into consideration and that the legislationwas aimed at reforming procedures rather than precludingspeech undercut respondents' argument that the provisioninevitably will be utilized as a tool for invidious viewpointdiscrimination. In cases where we have struck down legislation as facially unconstitutional, the dangers were bothmore evident and more substantial. In R. A. V. v. St. Paul,505 U. S. 377 (1992), for example, we invalidated on its facea municipal ordinance that defined as a criminal offense theplacement of a symbol on public or private property " `whichone knows or has reasonable grounds to know arouses anger,alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color,creed, religion or gender.' " See id., at 380. That provisionset forth a clear penalty, proscribed views on particular "disfavored subjects," id., at 391, and suppressed "distinctiveidea[s], conveyed by a distinctive message," id., at 393.524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN583Cite as: 524 U. S. 569 (1998)Opinion of the CourtIn contrast, the "decency and respect" criteria do notsilence speakers by expressly "threaten[ing] censorship ofideas." See ibid. Thus, we do not perceive a realistic dan-ger that $ 954(d)(1) will compromise First Amendment values. As respondents' own arguments demonstrate, the considerations that the provision introduces, by their nature, donot engender the kind of directed viewpoint discriminationthat would prompt this Court to invalidate a statute on itsface. Respondents assert, for example, that "[o]ne would behard-pressed to find two people in the United States whocould agree on what the `diverse beliefs and values of theAmerican public' are, much less on whether a particularwork of art `respects' them"; and they claim that " `[d]ecency'is likely to mean something very different to a septegenarianin Tuscaloosa and a teenager in Las Vegas." Brief for Respondents 41. The NEA likewise views the considerationsenumerated in $ 954(d)(1) as susceptible to multiple interpretations. See Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations for 1992, Hearing before the Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies of the HouseCommittee on Appropriations, 102d Cong., 1st Sess., 234(1991) (testimony of John Frohnmayer) ("[N]o one individualis wise enough to be able to consider general standards ofdecency and the diverse values and beliefs of the Americanpeople all by him or herself. These are group decisions").Accordingly, the provision does not introduce considerationsthat, in practice, would effectively preclude or punish theexpression of particular views. Indeed, one could hardlyanticipate how "decency" or "respect" would bear on grantapplications in categories such as funding for symphonyorchestras.Respondents' claim that the provision is facially unconstitutional may be reduced to the argument that the criteria in$ 954(d)(1) are sufficiently subjective that the agency couldutilize them to engage in viewpoint discrimination. Giventhe varied interpretations of the criteria and the vague ex524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN584 NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR ARTS v. FINLEYOpinion of the Courthortation to "take them into consideration," it seems un-likely that this provision will introduce any greater elementof selectivity than the determination of "artistic excellence"itself. And we are reluctant, in any event, to invalidate legislation "on the basis of its hypothetical application to situations not before the Court." FCC v. Pacifica Foundation,438 U. S. 726, 743 (1978).The NEA's enabling statute contemplates a number of in-disputably constitutional applications for both the "decency"prong of $ 954(d)(1) and its reference to "respect for the di-verse beliefs and values of the American public." Educational programs are central to the NEA's mission. See$ 951(9) ("Americans should receive in school, backgroundand preparation in the arts and humanities"); $ 954(c)(5) (listing "projects and productions that will encourage publicknowledge, education, understanding, and appreciation of thearts" among the NEA's funding priorities); National Endowment for the Arts, FY 1999 Application Guidelines 18-19 (describing "Education & Access" category); Brief for Twentysix Arts, Broadcast, Library, Museum and Publishing AmiciCuriae 5, n. 2 (citing NEA Strategic Plan FY 1997-FY 2002,which identifies children's festivals and museums, art education, at-risk youth projects, and artists in schools as examples of the NEA's activities). And it is well established that"decency" is a permissible factor where "educational suitability" motivates its consideration. Board of Ed., Island TreesUnion Free School Dist. No. 26 v. Pico, 457 U. S. 853, 871(1982); see also Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478U. S. 675, 683 (1986) ("Surely it is a highly appropriate function of public school education to prohibit the use of vulgarand offensive terms in public discourse").Permissible applications of the mandate to consider "respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public" are also apparent. In setting forth the purposes of theNEA, Congress explained that "[i]t is vital to a democracyto honor and preserve its multicultural artistic heritage."524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN585Cite as: 524 U. S. 569 (1998)Opinion of the Court$ 951(10). The agency expressly takes diversity into account, giving special consideration to "projects and productions . . . that reach, or reflect the culture of, a minority,inner city, rural, or tribal community," $ 954(c)(4), as wellas projects that generally emphasize "cultural diversity,"$ 954(c)(1). Respondents do not contend that the criteria in$ 954(d)(1) are impermissibly applied when they may be justified, as the statute contemplates, with respect to a project'sintended audience.We recognize, of course, that reference to these permissible applications would not alone be sufficient to sustain thestatute against respondents' First Amendment challenge.But neither are we persuaded that, in other applications, thelanguage of $ 954(d)(1) itself will give rise to the suppressionof protected expression. Any content-based considerationsthat may be taken into account in the grant-making processare a consequence of the nature of arts funding. The NEAhas limited resources, and it must deny the majority of thegrant applications that it receives, including many that propose "artistically excellent" projects. The agency may decide to fund particular projects for a wide variety of reasons,"such as the technical proficiency of the artist, the creativityof the work, the anticipated public interest in or appreciationof the work, the work's contemporary relevance, its educational value, its suitability for or appeal to special audiences(such as children or the disabled), its service to a rural orisolated community, or even simply that the work could increase public knowledge of an art form." Brief for Petitioners 32. As the dissent below noted, it would be "impossibleto have a highly selective grant program without denyingmoney to a large amount of constitutionally protected expression." 100 F. 3d, at 685 (opinion of Kleinfeld, J.). The"very assumption" of the NEA is that grants will be awardedaccording to the "artistic worth of competing applicants,"and absolute neutrality is simply "inconceivable."

S. 894 (1976).Respondents' reliance on our decision in Rosenberger v.Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995),is therefore misplaced. In Rosenberger, a public universitydeclined to authorize disbursements from its Student Activi-ties Fund to finance the printing of a Christian student newspaper. We held that by subsidizing the Student ActivitiesFund, the University had created a limited public forum,from which it impermissibly excluded all publications withreligious editorial viewpoints.Id., at 837. Although thescarcity of NEA funding does not distinguish this case fromRosenberger, see id., at 835, the competitive process according to which the grants are allocated does. In the contextof arts funding, in contrast to many other subsidies, the Government does not indiscriminately "encourage a diversity ofviews from private speakers," id., at 834. The NEA's mandate is to make esthetic judgments, and the inherentlycontent-based "excellence" threshold for NEA support setsit apart from the subsidy at issue in Rosenberger--which wasavailable to all student organizations that were " `related tothe educational purpose of the University,' " id., at 824--andfrom comparably objective decisions on allocating public benefits, such as access to a school auditorium or a municipaltheater, see Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union FreeSchool Dist., 508 U. S. 384, 386 (1993); Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U. S. 546, 555 (1975), or the secondclass mailing privileges available to " `all newspapers andother periodical publications,' " see Hannegan v. Esquire,Inc., 327 U.

Thus, we have no occasion hereto address an as-applied challenge in a situation where thedenial of a grant may be shown to be the product of invidiousviewpoint discrimination. If the NEA were to leverage itspower to award subsidies on the basis of subjective criteriainto a penalty on disfavored viewpoints, then we would confront a different case. We have stated that, even in the pro-vision of subsidies, the Government may not "ai[m] at thesuppression of dangerous ideas," Regan v. Taxation withRepresentation of Wash., 461 U. S. 540, 550 (1983) (internalquotation marks omitted), and if a subsidy were "manipulated" to have a "coercive effect," then relief could be appro-priate. SeeArkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481U. S. 221, 237 (1987) (Scalia, J., dissenting); see also Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U. S. 439, 447 (1991) ("[D]ifferential taxa-tion of First Amendment speakers is constitutionally suspectwhen it threatens to suppress the expression of particularideas or viewpoints"). In addition, as the NEA itself concedes, a more pressing constitutional question would arise ifGovernment funding resulted in the imposition of a disproportionate burden calculated to drive "certain ideas or view-points from the marketplace."Simon & Schuster, Inc. v.Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105,116 (1991); see Brief for Petitioners 38, n. 12. Unless$ 954(d)(1) is applied in a manner that raises concern aboutthe suppression of disfavored viewpoints, however, we up-hold the constitutionality of the provision. Cf.Red LionBroadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 396 (1969) ("[W]ewill not now pass upon the constitutionality of these regula-tions by envisioning the most extreme applications conceivable, but will deal with those problems if and when theyarise" (citation omitted)).BFinally, although the First Amendment certainly has ap-plication in the subsidy context, we note that the Government may allocate competitive funding according to criteria524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN588 NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR ARTS v. FINLEYOpinion of the Courtthat would be impermissible were direct regulation of speechor a criminal penalty at stake. So long as legislation doesnot infringe on other constitutionally protected rights, Con-gress has wide latitude to set spending priorities. SeeRegan, supra, at 549. In the 1990 amendments that incor-porated $ 954(d)(1), Congress modified the declaration of purpose in the NEA's enabling Act to provide that arts fundingshould "contribute to public support and confidence in theuse of taxpayer funds," and that "[p]ublic funds . . . mustultimately serve public purposes the Congress defines."$ 951(5). And as we held in Rust, Congress may "selectivelyfund a program to encourage certain activities it believes tobe in the public interest, without at the same time fundingan alternative program which seeks to deal with the problemin another way." 500 U. S., at 193. In doing so, "the Gov-ernment has not discriminated on the basis of viewpoint; ithas merely chosen to fund one activity to the exclusion ofthe other." Ibid.; see also Maher v. Roe, 432 U. S. 464, 475(1977) ("There is a basic difference between direct stateinterference with a protected activity and state encouragement of an alternative activity consonant with legislativepolicy").IIIThe lower courts also erred in invalidating $ 954(d)(1)as unconstitutionally vague. Under the First and FifthAmendments, speakers are protected from arbitrary and dis-criminatory enforcement of vague standards. SeeNAACPv. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 432-433 (1963). The terms of theprovision are undeniably opaque, and if they appeared in acriminal statute or regulatory scheme, they could raise substantial vagueness concerns. It is unlikely, however, thatspeakers will be compelled to steer too far clear of any "forbidden area" in the context of grants of this nature. Cf.Board of Airport Comm'rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus,Inc., 482 U. S. 569, 574 (1987) (facially invalidating a flat ban524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN589Cite as: 524 U. S. 569 (1998)Opinion of the Courton any "First Amendment" activities in an airport); HoffmanEstates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 499(1982) ("prohibitory and stigmatizing effect" of a "quasicriminal" ordinance relevant to the vagueness analysis);Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S., at 108 (requiringclear lines between "lawful and unlawful" conduct). We recognize, as a practical matter, that artists may conform theirspeech to what they believe to be the decisionmaking criteriain order to acquire funding. See Statement of CharlotteMurphy, Executive Director of NAAO, reprinted in App. 21-22. But when the Government is acting as patron ratherthan as sovereign, the consequences of imprecision are notconstitutionally severe.In the context of selective subsidies, it is not always feasible for Congress to legislate with clarity. Indeed, if thisstatute is unconstitutionally vague, then so too are all Government programs awarding scholarships and grants on thebasis of subjective criteria such as "excellence." See, e. g.,2 U. S. C. $ 802 (establishing the Congressional Award Program to "promote initiative, achievement, and excellenceamong youths in the areas of public service, personal development, and physical and expedition fitness"); 20 U. S. C.$ 956(c)(1) (providing funding to the National Endowment forthe Humanities to promote "progress and scholarship in thehumanities"); $ 1134h(a) (authorizing the Secretary of Education to award fellowships to "students of superior ability selected on the basis of demonstrated achievement and exceptional promise"); 22 U. S. C. $ 2452(a) (authorizing the awardof Fulbright grants to "strengthen international cooperativerelations"); 42 U. S. C. $ 7382c (authorizing the Secretary ofEnergy to recognize teachers for "excellence in mathematicsor science education"). To accept respondents' vaguenessargument would be to call into question the constitutionalityof these valuable Government programs and countless otherslike them.524US2 Unit: $U95 [09-06-00 18:40:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN590 NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR ARTS v. FINLEYScalia, J., concurring in judgmentSection 954(d)(1) merely adds some imprecise considera-tions to an already subjective selection process. It does not,on its face, impermissibly infringe on First or Fifth Amend-ment rights. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for furtherproceedings consistent with this opinion.
