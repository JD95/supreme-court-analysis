Alabama law vests capital sentencing authority in the trialjudge, but requires the judge to consider an advisory juryverdict. We granted certiorari to consider petitioner's ar-gument that Alabama's capital sentencing statute is unconstitutional because it does not specify the weight the judgemust give to the jury's recommendation and thus permitsarbitrary imposition of the death penalty.513us2$26J 03-30-98 09:01:14 PAGES OPINPGT506 HARRIS v. ALABAMAOpinion of the CourtIA defendant convicted of capital murder in Alabama isentitled to a sentencing hearing before the trial jury, Ala.Code $ 13A-5-46 (1994), unless jury participation is waivedby both parties and approved by the court, $ 13A-5-44. TheState must prove statutory aggravating factors beyond areasonable doubt and must disprove, by a preponderance ofthe evidence, any mitigating circumstance the defendant mayproffer. $ 13A-5-45(g). The jury then renders an advisoryverdict. If it finds that aggravating factors, if any, outweighmitigating circumstances, then the jury recommends death;otherwise, the verdict is life imprisonment without parole.$ 13A-5-46(e). The jury may recommend death only if 10jurors so agree, while a verdict of life imprisonment requiresa simple majority. $ 13A-5-46(f). The recommendationand vote tally are reported to the judge.The judge then must consider all available evidence andfile a written statement detailing the defendant's crime, list-ing specific aggravating and mitigating factors, and imposinga sentence. Section 13A-5-47(e) provides:"In deciding upon the sentence, the trial court shalldetermine whether the aggravating circumstances itfinds to exist outweigh the mitigating circumstancesit finds to exist, and in doing so the trial courtshall consider the recommendation of the jury containedin its advisory verdict, unless such a verdict has beenwaived pursuant to Section 13A-5-46(a) or 13A-5-46(g). While the jury's recommendation concerningsentence shall be given consideration, it is not bindingupon the court."If the defendant is sentenced to death, his conviction andsentence are automatically reviewed by an appellate courtand, if affirmed, a writ of certiorari is granted by the Ala-bama Supreme Court as a matter of right. In addition toreviewing the record for errors, the appellate courts must513us2$26J 03-30-98 09:01:14 PAGES OPINPGT507Cite as: 513 U. S. 504 (1995)Opinion of the Courtindependently weigh aggravating and mitigating circum-stances and determine whether the death penalty is disproportionate to sentences rendered in comparable cases.$ 13A-5-53(b).Petitioner Louise Harris was married to the victim, a deputy sheriff, and was also having an affair with Lorenzo Mc-Carter. She asked McCarter to find someone to kill her husband, and McCarter to that end approached a co-worker, whorefused and reported the solicitation to his supervisor. McCarter then found willing accomplices in Michael Sockwelland Alex Hood, who were paid $100 and given a vague promise of more money upon performance. On the appointednight, as her husband left for work on the night shift, Harriscalled McCarter on his beeper to alert him. McCarter andHood sat in a car parked on a nearby street, and Sockwellhid in the bushes next to a stop sign. As the victim stoppedhis car at the intersection, Sockwell sprang forth and shothim, point blank, with a shotgun. Harris was arrested afterquestioning, and McCarter agreed to bear witness to the conspiracy in exchange for the prosecutor's promise not to seekthe death penalty. McCarter testified that Harris had askedhim to kill her husband so they could share in his death benefits, which totaled about $250,000.The jury convicted Harris of capital murder. At the sentencing hearing, a number of witnesses attested to her goodbackground and strong character. She was rearing sevenchildren, held three jobs simultaneously, and participatedactively in her church. The jury recommended, by a 7 to 5vote, that she be imprisoned for life without parole. Thetrial judge then considered her sentence, finding the existence of one aggravating circumstance, that the murder wascommitted for pecuniary gain, and one statutory mitigator,that Harris had no prior criminal record. The trial judgealso found as nonstatutory mitigating circumstances thatHarris was a hardworking, respected member of her churchand community. Noting that Harris had planned the crime513us2$26J 03-30-98 09:01:14 PAGES OPINPGT508 HARRIS v. ALABAMAOpinion of the Courtand financed its commission and stood to benefit the mostfrom her husband's murder, the judge concluded that "theone statutory aggravating circumstance found and consid-ered far outweighs all of the non-statutory mitigating circumstances, and that the sentence ought to be death." App.7. In separate proceedings, all the conspirators were convicted of capital murder. McCarter and Hood receivedprison terms of life without parole; Sockwell, the triggerman,was sentenced to death after the trial judge rejected a juryrecommendation, again by a 7 to 5 vote, of life imprisonment.The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Harris'conviction and sentence. 632 So. 2d 503 (1992). It notedthat Alabama's death penalty statute is based on Florida'ssentencing scheme, which we have held to be constitutional,see Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U. S. 447, 457-467 (1984); Prof-fitt v. Florida, 428 U. S. 242, 252 (1976) ( joint opinion ofStewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). One difference is thatjury recommendations are to be given "great weight" by thesentencing judge in Florida, see Tedder v. State, 322 So. 2d908, 910 (Fla. 1975), whereas Alabama only requires thejudge to "consider" the advisory verdict. The Court ofCriminal Appeals rejected Harris' contention that Florida'sso-called Tedder standard is constitutionally required, how-ever. 632 So. 2d, at 538. As the statute prescribes, thecourt then reviewed the record for prejudicial errors andindependently weighed the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Finding no errors and concluding that deathwas the proper sentence, the court affirmed. Id., at 542-543. The Alabama Supreme Court also affirmed, discussingan unrelated claim. 632 So. 2d 543 (1993). We grantedcertiorari. 512 U. S. 1234 (1994).IIAlabama's capital sentencing scheme is much like that ofFlorida. Both require jury participation in the sentencing process but give ultimate sentencing authority to the513us2$26J 03-30-98 09:01:14 PAGES OPINPGT509Cite as: 513 U.

Code $ 13A-5-55 (1994); Fla. Stat. $ 921.141(4) (1985). In Florida, as inAlabama, the reviewing courts must independently weighaggravating and mitigating circumstances to determine thepropriety of the death sentence, Ala.

S. 956 (1977), and must decide whether the penalty isexcessive or disproportionate compared to similar cases, Ala.Code $ 13A-5-53(b)(3) (1994);Williams v. State, 437 So. 2d133 (Fla. 1983), cert. denied, 466 U. S. 909 (1984).The two States differ in one important respect. The Florida Supreme Court has opined that the trial judge must give"great weight" to the jury's recommendation and may notoverride the advisory verdict of life unless "the facts suggesting a sentence of death [are] so clear and convincing thatvirtually no reasonable person could differ." Tedder v.State, supra, at 910. The same deference inures to a juryrecommendation of death. See Grossman v. State, 525 So.2d 833, 839, n. 1 (Fla. 1988) (collecting cases). The Alabamacapital sentencing statute, by contrast, requires only that thejudge "consider" the jury's recommendation, and Alabamacourts have refused to read the Tedder standard into thestatute. See Ex parte Jones, 456 So. 2d 380, 382-383 (Ala.1984). This distinction between the Alabama and Floridaschemes forms the controversy in this case--whether theEighth Amendment to the Constitution requires the sentencing judge to ascribe any particular weight to the verdict ofan advisory jury.We have held Florida's capital sentencing statute to beconstitutional. See Proffitt v. Florida, supra; Spaziano v.Florida, supra. In Spaziano, we addressed the specificquestion whether Florida could, consistent with the Constitution, vest sentencing authority in the judge and relegatethe jury to an advisory role. While acknowledging that sen513us2$26J 03-30-98 09:01:14 PAGES OPINPGT510 HARRIS v. ALABAMAOpinion of the Courttencing power resides with the jury in most States, we madeclear that the "Eighth Amendment is not violated every timea State reaches a conclusion different from a majority of itssisters over how best to administer its criminal laws."Id.,at 464. We therefore rejected the contention that "placingthe responsibility on a trial judge to impose the sentence ina capital case is so fundamentally at odds with contemporarystandards of fairness and decency that Florida must be re-quired to alter its scheme and give final authority to thejury to make the life-or-death decision." Id., at 465; see alsoWalton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 648 (1990); Clemons v.Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738, 745 (1990).Asserting that the death penalty serves no function in"rehabilitation," "incapacitation," or "deterren[ce]," JusticeStevens argues that a jury "should bear the responsibilityto express the conscience of the community on the ultimatequestion of life or death in particular cases." Post, at 517,518 (internal quotation marks omitted). What purpose isserved by capital punishment and how a State should implement its capital punishment scheme--to the extent thatthose questions involve only policy issues--are matters overwhich we, as judges, have no jurisdiction. Our power of judicial review legitimately extends only to determine whetherthe policy choices of the community, expressed through itslegislative enactments, comport with the Constitution. Aswe have noted elsewhere, "while we have an obligation toinsure that constitutional bounds are not overreached, wemay not act as judges as we might as legislators." Greggv. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 174-175 (1976) ( joint opinion ofStewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).In various opinions on the Florida statute we have spokenfavorably of the deference that a judge must accord the juryverdict under Florida law. While rejecting an ex post factochallenge in Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282, 294 (1977), wenoted the "crucial protection" provided by the standardof Tedder v. State, supra, at 910. In the same fashion, in513us2$26J 03-30-98 09:01:14 PAGES OPINPGT511Cite as: 513 U. S. 504 (1995)Opinion of the Courtdismissing Spaziano's argument that the Tedder standardwas wrongly applied by the lower courts in his case, westated:"This Court already has recognized the significant safeguard the Tedder standard affords a capital defendant inFlorida. SeeDobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282, 294-295(1977). See also Proffitt, 428 U. S., at 249 ( joint opin-ion). We are satisfied that the Florida Supreme Courttakes that standard seriously and has not hesitatedto reverse a trial court if it derogates the jury's role."Spaziano, supra, at 465.These statements of approbation, however, do not meanthat the Tedder standard is constitutionally required. Aswe stated inSpaziano immediately following the passagequoted above: "Our responsibility, however, is not to secondguess the deference accorded the jury's recommendation ina particular case, but to ensure that the result of the processis not arbitrary or discriminatory." 468 U. S., at 465. Wethus made clear that, our praise forTedder notwithstanding,the hallmark of the analysis is not the particular weight aState chooses to place upon the jury's advice, but whetherthe scheme adequately channels the sentencer's discretion soas to prevent arbitrary results. See alsoProffitt, 428 U. S.,at 252-253 ( joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens,JJ.).Consistent with established constitutional law, Alabamahas chosen to guide the sentencing decision by requiring thejury and judge to weigh aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Harris does not challenge this legislative choice.And she objects to neither the vesting of sentencing authority in the judge nor the requirement that the advisory verdict be considered in the process. What she seeks insteadis a constitutional mandate as to how that verdict should beconsidered; relying on Florida's standard, she suggests thatthe judge must give "great weight" to the jury's advice.513us2$26J 03-30-98 09:01:14 PAGES OPINPGT512 HARRIS v. ALABAMAOpinion of the CourtWe have rejected the notion that "a specific method forbalancing mitigating and aggravating factors in a capital sentencing proceeding is constitutionally required." Franklinv.Lynaugh, 487 U. S. 164, 179 (1988). Equally settled is thecorollary that the Constitution does not require a State toascribe any specific weight to particular factors, either inaggravation or mitigation, to be considered by the sentencer.See, e. g., Blystone v. Pennsylvania, 494 U. S. 299, 306-307(1990);Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 113-115 (1982);Proffitt, supra, at 257-258 ( joint opinion of Stewart, Powell,andStevens, JJ.). To require that "great weight" be givento the jury recommendation here, one of the criteria to beconsidered by the sentencer, would offend these establishedprinciples and place within constitutional ambit micromanagement tasks that properly rest within the State's discretion to administer its criminal justice system. We thereforehold that the Eighth Amendment does not require the Stateto define the weight the sentencing judge must accord anadvisory jury verdict.Harris argues that, under Alabama law, the verdict is morethan advisory and that the jury in fact enjoys the key sentencing role, subject only to review by the judge. For support, she points to Alabama cases reversing death sentenceswhere prejudicial errors were committed before the advisoryjury. See Ex parte Williams, 556 So. 2d 744, 745 (Ala. 1987).Unless the jury played a key role, so goes the argument,reversal would not be warranted because the sentencingjudge was not exposed to the same harmful error. The flawin this contention is that reversal is proper so long as thejury recommendation plays a role in the judge's decision, notnecessarily a determinative one. If the judge must considerthe jury verdict in sentencing a capital defendant, as thestatute plainly requires, then it follows that a sentence isinvalid if the recommendation upon which it partially restswas rendered erroneously. In Espinosa v. Florida, 505U. S. 1079 (1992), the advisory jury, but not the sentencing513us2$26J 03-30-98 09:01:14 PAGES OPINPGT513Cite as: 513 U. S. 504 (1995)Opinion of the Courtjudge, was presented with an invalid aggravating factor.We summarily reversed the death sentence, explaining that"Florida has essentially split the weighing process in two.Initially, the jury weighs aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and the result of that weighing process is then inturn weighed within the trial court's process of weighingaggravating and mitigating circumstances."Id., at 1082.Error is committed when the jury considers an invalid factorand its verdict is in turn considered by the judge: "This kindof indirect weighing of an invalid aggravating factor createsthe same potential for arbitrariness as the direct weighingof an invalid aggravating factor, and the result, therefore,was error." Ibid. (citation omitted). Such consequentialerror attaches whenever the jury recommendation is considered in the process, not only when it is given great weightby the judge.We have observed in the Florida context that permittingthe trial judge to reject the jury's advisory verdict may afford capital defendants "a second chance for life with thetrial judge," Dobbert, 432 U. S., at 296. In practice, however, Alabama's sentencing scheme has yielded some ostensibly surprising statistics. According to the Alabama PrisonProject, there have been only 5 cases in which the judgerejected an advisory verdict of death, compared to 47 instances where the judge imposed a death sentence over ajury recommendation of life. Statistics compiled by the Alabama Prison Project (Nov. 29, 1994) (lodged with the Clerkof this Court). But these numbers do not tell the wholestory. We do not know, for instance, how many cases inwhich a jury recommendation of life imprisonment is adoptedwould have ended differently had the judge not been required to consider the jury's advice. Without such a subjective look into the minds of the decisionmakers, the deceptively objective numbers afford at best an incompletepicture. Even assuming that these statistics reflect a trueview of capital sentencing in Alabama, they say little about513us2$26J 03-30-98 09:01:14 PAGES OPINPGT514 HARRIS v. ALABAMAOpinion of the Courtwhether the scheme is constitutional. That question turnsnot solely on a numerical tabulation of actual death sentencesas compared to a hypothetical alternative, but rather onwhether the penalties imposed are the product of properlyguided discretion and not of arbitrary whim. If the Alabama statute indeed has not had the effect that we or itsdrafters had anticipated, such unintended results would beof little constitutional consequence. An ineffectual law is forthe state legislature to amend, not for us to annul.Harris draws our attention to apparent disparities in theweight given to jury verdicts in different cases in Alabama.For example, the trial judge here did not specify his reasonfor rejecting the jury's advice but in another case wrote thathe accorded "great weight" to the recommendation, State v.Coral, No. CC-88-741 (Montgomery Cty., June 26, 1992), Alabama Capital Sentencing Orders, p. 72 (lodged with theClerk of this Court). In rejecting the jury verdict, otherjudges have commented variously that there was a "reasonable basis" to do so, State v. Parker, No. CC-88-105 (ColbertCty., Dec. 3, 1991), Alabama Capital Sentencing Orders, at408, that the verdict was "unquestionably a bizarre result,"Ex parte Hays, 518 So. 2d 768, 777 (Ala. 1986), or that "if thiswere not a proper case for the death penalty to be imposed, aproper case can scarcely be imagined," State v. Frazier, No.CC-85-3291 (Mobile Cty., July 31, 1990), Alabama CapitalSentencing Orders, at 139. Juxtaposing these statements,Harris argues that the Alabama statute permits judges toreject arbitrarily the advisory verdict, thereby abusing theirsentencing discretion.But these statements do not indicate that the judges havedivergent understandings of the statutory requirement thatthe jury verdicts be considered; they simply illustrate howdifferent judges have "considered" the jury's advice. Thereis no reason to expect that the advisory verdicts will betreated uniformly in every case. The Alabama statute provides that the weighing process "shall not be defined to mean513us2$26J 03-30-98 09:01:14 PAGES OPINPGT515Cite as: 513 U. S. 504 (1995)Stevens, J., dissentinga mere tallying of aggravating and mitigating circumstancesfor the purpose of numerical comparison," Ala. Code $ 13A-5-48 (1994), which is no less than what the Constitution re-quires, seeProffitt, 428 U. S., at 258 ( joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). The disparate treatment ofjury verdicts simply reflects the fact that, in the subjectiveweighing process, the emphasis given to each decisionalcriterion must of necessity vary in order to account for theparticular circumstances of each case. SeeEddings v.Oklahoma, 455 U. S., at 112 ("[A] consistency produced byignoring individual differences is a false consistency"). Inany event, Harris does not show how the various statementsaffect her case. She does not bring an equal protectionclaim, and she does not contest the lower courts' conclusionthat her sentence is proportionate to that imposed in similarcases. The sentiments expressed in unrelated cases do notrender her punishment violative of the Eighth Amendment.The Constitution permits the trial judge, acting alone, toimpose a capital sentence. It is thus not offended when aState further requires the sentencing judge to consider ajury's recommendation and trusts the judge to give it theproper weight. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of theAlabama Supreme Court.
