This case requires us to decide whether the use of exces-sive physical force against a prisoner may constitute crueland unusual punishment when the inmate does not sufferserious injury. We answer that question in the affirmative.IAt the time of the incident that is the subject of this suit,petitioner Keith Hudson was an inmate at the state penitentiary in Angola, Louisiana. Respondents Jack McMillian,Marvin Woods, and Arthur Mezo served as corrections security officers at the Angola facility. During the early morn-ing hours of October 30, 1983, Hudson and McMillian argued.Assisted by Woods, McMillian then placed Hudson in hand-cuffs and shackles, took the prisoner out of his cell, andwalked him toward the penitentiary's "administrative lock-down" area. Hudson testified that, on the way there, McMillian punched Hudson in the mouth, eyes, chest, and stomachwhile Woods held the inmate in place and kicked andpunched him from behind. He further testified that Mezo,the supervisor on duty, watched the beating but merely toldthe officers "not to have too much fun." App. 23. As a re-sult of this episode, Hudson suffered minor bruises and swelling of his face, mouth, and lip. The blows also loosened Hud-son's teeth and cracked his partial dental plate, rendering itunusable for several months.Hudson sued the three corrections officers in FederalDistrict Court under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983,alleging a violation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments and seeking com-pensatory damages. The parties consented to disposition ofthe case before a Magistrate, who found that McMillianand Woods used force when there was no need to do soand that Mezo expressly condoned their actions. App. 26.The Magistrate awarded Hudson damages of $800.Id.,at 29.503us1$32I 11-22-95 08:46:24 PAGES OPINPGT5Cite as: 503 U. S. 1 (1992)Opinion of the CourtThe Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed. 929F. 2d 1014 (1990). It held that inmates alleging use of excessive force in violation of the Eighth Amendment must prove:(1) significant injury; (2) resulting "directly and only fromthe use of force that was clearly excessive to the need"; (3)the excessiveness of which was objectively unreasonable; and(4) that the action constituted an unnecessary and wantoninfliction of pain.Id., at 1015. The court determined thatrespondents' use of force was objectively unreasonable because no force was required. Furthermore, "[t]he conductof McMillian and Woods qualified as clearly excessive andoccasioned unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain." Ibid.However, Hudson could not prevail on his Eighth Amendment claim because his injuries were "minor" and requiredno medical attention.Ibid.We granted certiorari, 499 U. S. 958 (1991), to determinewhether the "significant injury" requirement applied by theCourt of Appeals accords with the Constitution's dictate thatcruel and unusual punishment shall not be inflicted.IIIn Whitley v. Albers, 475 U. S. 312 (1986), the principalquestion before us was what legal standard should governthe Eighth Amendment claim of an inmate shot by a guardduring a prison riot. We based our answer on the settledrule that " `the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain . . .constitutes cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by theEighth Amendment.' " Id., at 319 (quoting Ingraham v.Wright, 430 U. S. 651, 670 (1977)) (internal quotation marksomitted).What is necessary to establish an "unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain," we said, varies according to the natureof the alleged constitutional violation. 475 U. S., at 320.For example, the appropriate inquiry when an inmate allegesthat prison officials failed to attend to serious medical needsis whether the officials exhibited "deliberate indifference."503us1$32I 11-22-95 08:46:24 PAGES OPINPGT6 HUDSON v. McMILLIANOpinion of the CourtSee Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 104 (1976). This stand-ard is appropriate because the State's responsibility to provide inmates with medical care ordinarily does not conflictwith competing administrative concerns.Whitley, supra,at 320.By contrast, officials confronted with a prison disturbancemust balance the threat unrest poses to inmates, prisonworkers, administrators, and visitors against the harm in-mates may suffer if guards use force. Despite the weight ofthese competing concerns, corrections officials must maketheir decisions "in haste, under pressure, and frequentlywithout the luxury of a second chance." 475 U. S., at 320.We accordingly concluded in Whitley that application of thedeliberate indifference standard is inappropriate when authorities use force to put down a prison disturbance. Instead, "the question whether the measure taken inflicted unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering ultimately turns on`whether force was applied in a good faith effort to maintainor restore discipline or maliciously and sadistically for thevery purpose of causing harm.' " Id., at 320-321 (quotingJohnson v. Glick, 481 F. 2d 1028, 1033 (CA2), cert. deniedsub nom. John v. Johnson, 414 U. S. 1033 (1973)).Many of the concerns underlying our holding in Whitleyarise whenever guards use force to keep order. Whetherthe prison disturbance is a riot or a lesser disruption, corrections officers must balance the need "to maintain or restorediscipline" through force against the risk of injury to inmates. Both situations may require prison officials to actquickly and decisively. Likewise, both implicate the principle that " `[p]rison administrators . . . should be accordedwide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution ofpolicies and practices that in their judgment are needed topreserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.' " 475 U. S., at 321-322 (quoting Bell v.Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 547 (1979)). In recognition of thesesimilarities, we hold that whenever prison officials stand ac503us1$32I 11-22-95 08:46:24 PAGES OPINPGT7Cite as: 503 U. S. 1 (1992)Opinion of the Courtcused of using excessive physical force in violation of theCruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, the core judicial inquiry is that set out in Whitley: whether force was appliedin a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.ExtendingWhitley's application of the "unnecessary andwanton infliction of pain" standard to all allegations of excessive force works no innovation. This Court derived theWhitley test from one articulated by Judge Friendly in Johnson v. Glick, supra, a case arising out of a prisoner's claimto have been beaten and harassed by a guard. Moreover,many Courts of Appeals already apply the Whitley standardto allegations of excessive force outside of the riot situation.See Corselli v. Coughlin, 842 F. 2d 23, 26 (CA2 1988); Millerv.Leathers, 913 F. 2d 1085, 1087 (CA4 1990) (en banc), cert.denied, 498 U. S. 1109 (1991); Haynes v. Marshall, 887 F. 2d700, 703 (CA6 1989); Stenzel v. Ellis, 916 F. 2d 423, 427 (CA81990); Brown v. Smith, 813 F. 2d 1187, 1188 (CA11 1987).But see Unwin v. Campbell, 863 F. 2d 124, 130 (CA1 1988)(rejecting application ofWhitley standard absent "an actualdisturbance").AUnder the Whitley approach, the extent of injury sufferedby an inmate is one factor that may suggest "whether theuse of force could plausibly have been thought necessary" ina particular situation, "or instead evinced such wantonnesswith respect to the unjustified infliction of harm as is tanta-mount to a knowing willingness that it occur." 475 U. S., at321. In determining whether the use of force was wantonand unnecessary, it may also be proper to evaluate the needfor application of force, the relationship between that needand the amount of force used, the threat "reasonably perceived by the responsible officials," and "any efforts madeto temper the severity of a forceful response." Ibid. Theabsence of serious injury is therefore relevant to the EighthAmendment inquiry, but does not end it.503us1$32I 11-22-95 08:46:24 PAGES OPINPGT8 HUDSON v. McMILLIANOpinion of the CourtRespondents nonetheless assert that a significant injuryrequirement of the sort imposed by the Fifth Circuit is mandated by what we have termed the "objective component" ofEighth Amendment analysis. SeeWilson v. Seiter, 501U. S. 294, 298 (1991). Wilson extended the deliberate indifference standard applied to Eighth Amendment claims in-volving medical care to claims about conditions of confinement. In taking this step, we suggested that the subjectiveaspect of an Eighth Amendment claim (with which the Courtwas concerned) can be distinguished from the objective facetof the same claim. Thus, courts considering a prisoner'sclaim must ask both if "the officials act[ed] with a sufficientlyculpable state of mind" and if the alleged wrongdoing wasobjectively "harmful enough" to establish a constitutional violation. Id., at 298, 303.With respect to the objective component of an EighthAmendment violation, Wilson announced no new rule. Instead, that decision suggested a relationship between the requirements applicable to different types of Eighth Amendment claims. What is necessary to show sufficient harm forpurposes of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause depends upon the claim at issue, for two reasons. First, "[t]hegeneral requirement that an Eighth Amendment claimantallege and prove the unnecessary and wanton infliction ofpain should . . . be applied with due regard for differences inthe kind of conduct against which an Eighth Amendmentobjection is lodged." Whitley, supra, at 320. Second, theEighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments " `draw[s] its meaning from the evolving standardsof decency that mark the progress of a maturing society,' "and so admits of few absolute limitations. Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U. S. 337, 346 (1981) (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion)).The objective component of an Eighth Amendment claimis therefore contextual and responsive to "contemporarystandards of decency." Estelle, supra, at 103. For in503us1$32I 11-22-95 08:46:24 PAGES OPINPGT9Cite as: 503 U. S. 1 (1992)Opinion of the Courtstance, extreme deprivations are required to make out aconditions-of-confinement claim. Because routine discomfort is "part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay fortheir offenses against society,"Rhodes, supra, at 347, "onlythose deprivations denying `the minimal civilized measure oflife's necessities' are sufficiently grave to form the basis ofan Eighth Amendment violation."Wilson, supra, at 298(quoting Rhodes, supra, at 347) (citation omitted). A similaranalysis applies to medical needs. Because society does notexpect that prisoners will have unqualified access to healthcare, deliberate indifference to medical needs amounts to anEighth Amendment violation only if those needs are "serious." See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S., at 103-104.In the excessive force context, society's expectations aredifferent. When prison officials maliciously and sadisticallyuse force to cause harm, contemporary standards of decencyalways are violated. See Whitley, supra, at 327. This istrue whether or not significant injury is evident. Otherwise, the Eighth Amendment would permit any physicalpunishment, no matter how diabolic or inhuman, inflictingless than some arbitrary quantity of injury. Such a resultwould have been as unacceptable to the drafters of theEighth Amendment as it is today. See Estelle, supra, at102 (proscribing torture and barbarous punishment was "theprimary concern of the drafters" of the Eighth Amendment);Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S. 130, 136 (1879) ("[I]t is safe toaffirm that punishments of torture . . . and all others in thesame line of unnecessary cruelty, are forbidden by [theEighth Amendment]").That is not to say that every malevolent touch by a prisonguard gives rise to a federal cause of action. See Johnsonv. Glick, 481 F. 2d, at 1033 ("Not every push or shove, evenif it may later seem unnecessary in the peace of a judge'schambers, violates a prisoner's constitutional rights"). TheEighth Amendment's prohibition of "cruel and unusual" punishments necessarily excludes from constitutional recognition503us1$32I 11-22-95 08:46:24 PAGES OPINPGT10 HUDSON v. McMILLIANOpinion of the Courtde minimis uses of physical force, provided that the use offorce is not of a sort " `repugnant to the conscience of mankind.' " Whitley, 475 U. S., at 327 (quoting Estelle, supra,at 106) (internal quotation marks omitted).In this case, the Fifth Circuit found Hudson's claim untena-ble because his injuries were "minor." 929 F. 2d, at 1015.Yet the blows directed at Hudson, which caused bruises,swelling, loosened teeth, and a cracked dental plate, are notde minimis for Eighth Amendment purposes. The extentof Hudson's injuries thus provides no basis for dismissal ofhis $ 1983 claim. BThe dissent's theory that Wilson requires an inmate whoalleges excessive use of force to show serious injuryin addi-tion to the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain misapplies Wilson and ignores the body of our Eighth Amendmentjurisprudence. As we have already suggested, the questionbefore the Court in Wilson was "[w]hether a prisoner claim-ing that conditions of confinement constitute cruel and unusual punishment must show a culpable state of mind on thepart of prison officials, and, if so, what state of mind is required." Wilson, supra, at 296. Wilson presented neitheran allegation of excessive force nor any issue relating to whatwas dubbed the "objective component" of an Eighth Amend-ment claim.Wilson did touch on these matters in the course of summa-rizing our prior holdings, beginning with Estelle v. Gamble,supra. Estelle, we noted, first applied the Cruel and Un-usual Punishments Clause to deprivations that were notspecifically part of the prisoner's sentence. Wilson, supra,at 297. As might be expected from this primacy,Estellestated the principle underlying the cases discussed in Wilson: Punishments "incompatible with the evolving standardsof decency that mark the progress of a maturing society" or"involv[ing] the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain"are "repugnant to the Eighth Amendment." Estelle, supra,503us1$32I 11-22-95 08:46:24 PAGES OPINPGT11Cite as: 503 U. S. 1 (1992)Opinion of the Courtat 102-103 (internal quotation marks omitted). This is thesame rule the dissent would reject. With respect to the objective component of an Eighth Amendment claim, however,Wilson suggested no departure from Estelle and its progeny.The dissent's argument that claims based on excessiveforce and claims based on conditions of confinement are nodifferent in kind, post, at 24-25, and n. 4, is likewise un-founded. Far from rejectingWhitley's insight that the un-necessary and wanton infliction of pain standard must beapplied with regard for the nature of the alleged EighthAmendment violation, the Wilson Court adopted it. SeeWilson, 501 U. S., at 302-303. How could it be otherwisewhen the constitutional touchstone is whether punishment iscruel and unusual? To deny, as the dissent does, the differ-ence between punching a prisoner in the face and servinghim unappetizing food is to ignore the " `concepts of dignity,civilized standards, humanity, and decency' " that animatethe Eighth Amendment. Estelle, supra, at 102 (quotingJackson v. Bishop, 404 F. 2d 571, 579 (CA8 1968)).CRespondents argue that, aside from the significant injurytest applied by the Fifth Circuit, their conduct cannot constitute an Eighth Amendment violation because it was "isolatedand unauthorized." Brief for Respondents 28. The beatingof Hudson, they contend, arose from "a personal dispute be-tween correctional security officers and a prisoner," and wasagainst prison policy. Ibid. Respondents invoke the rea-soning of courts that have held the use of force by prisonofficers under such circumstances beyond the scope of "pun-ishment" prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. SeeJohn-son v. Glick, supra, at 1032 ("[A]lthough a spontaneous attack by a guard is `cruel' and, we hope, `unusual,' it does notfit any ordinary concept of `punishment' "); George v. Evans,633 F. 2d 413, 416 (CA5 1980) ("[A] single, unauthorized as-sault by a guard does not constitute cruel and unusual pun503us1$32I 11-22-95 08:46:24 PAGES OPINPGT12 HUDSON v. McMILLIANOpinion of Stevens, J.ishment . . ."). But see Duckworth v. Franzen, 780 F. 2d645, 652 (CA7 1985) ("If a guard decided to supplement aprisoner's official punishment by beating him, this would bepunishment . . ."), cert. denied, 479 U. S. 816 (1986).We take no position on respondents' legal argument be-cause we find it inapposite on this record. The Court ofAppeals left intact the Magistrate's determination that theviolence at issue in this case was "not an isolated assault."App. 27, n. 1. Indeed, there was testimony that McMillianand Woods beat another prisoner shortly after they finishedwith Hudson. Ibid. To the extent that respondents rely onthe unauthorized nature of their acts, they make a claim notaddressed by the Fifth Circuit, not presented by the ques-tion on which we granted certiorari, and, accordingly, notbefore this Court. Moreover, respondents ignore the Mag-istrate's finding that Lieutenant Mezo, acting as a supervisor,"expressly condoned the use of force in this instance."App. 26.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
