This case involves an action for damages against a railroaddue to its alleged failure to maintain adequate warningdevices at a grade crossing in western Tennessee. Afterher husband was killed in a crossing accident, respondentbrought suit against petitioner, the operator of the train in-volved in the collision. Respondent claimed that the warning signs posted at the crossing, which had been installedusing federal funds, were insufficient to warn motorists ofthe danger posed by passing trains. The specific issue wemust decide is whether the Federal Railroad Safety Act of1970, 84 Stat. 971, as amended, 49 U. S. C. $ 20101 et seq.,in conjunction with the Federal Highway Administration'sregulation addressing the adequacy of warning devices in-stalled with federal funds, pre-empts state tort actions suchas respondent's. We hold that it does.IAIn 1970, Congress enacted the Federal Railroad Safety Act(FRSA) "to promote safety in every area of railroad operations and reduce railroad-related accidents and incidents."49 U. S. C. $ 20101. The FRSA grants the Secretary ofTransportation the authority to "prescribe regulations andissue orders for every area of railroad safety," $ 20103(a), anddirects the Secretary to "maintain a coordinated effort todevelop and carry out solutions to the railroad grade crossingproblem," $ 20134(a). The FRSA also contains an expresspre-emption provision, which states:"Laws, regulations, and orders related to railroadsafety shall be nationally uniform to the extent practicable. A State may adopt or continue in force a law,regulation, or order related to railroad safety until theSecretary of Transportation prescribes a regulation or529US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-01 10:03:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN348 NORFOLK SOUTHERN R. CO. v. SHANKLINOpinion of the Courtissues an order covering the subject matter of the Staterequirement." $ 20106.Although the pre-emption provision contains an exception,seeibid., it is inapplicable here.Three years after passing the FRSA, Congress enactedthe Highway Safety Act of 1973, $ 203, 87 Stat. 283, which,among other things, created the Federal Railway-HighwayCrossings Program (Crossings Program), see 23 U. S. C.$ 130. That program makes funds available to States for the"cost of construction of projects for the elimination of hazards of railway-highway crossings." $ 130(a). To partici-pate in the Crossings Program, all States must "conduct andsystematically maintain a survey of all highways to identifythose railroad crossings which may require separation, relocation, or protective devices, and establish and implementa schedule of projects for this purpose." $ 130(d). Thatschedule must, "[a]t a minimum, . . . provide signs for allrailway-highway crossings." Ibid.The Secretary, through the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), has promulgated several regulations implementing the Crossings Program. One of those regulations,23 CFR $ 646.214(b) (1999), addresses the design of gradecrossing improvements. More specifically, $$ 646.214(b)(3)and (4) address the adequacy of warning devices installedunder the program.* According to $ 646.214(b)(3), "[a]de*Sections 646.214(b)(3) and (4) provide in full:"(3)(i) Adequate warning devices, under $ 646.214(b)(2) or on any projectwhere Federal-aid funds participate in the installation of the devices areto include automatic gates with flashing light signals when one or more ofthe following conditions exist:"(A) Multiple main line railroad tracks."(B) Multiple tracks at or in the vicinity of the crossing which may beoccupied by a train or locomotive so as to obscure the movement of anothertrain approaching the crossing."(C) High Speed train operation combined with limited sight distanceat either single or multiple track crossings.529US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-01 10:03:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN349Cite as: 529 U. S. 344 (2000)Opinion of the Courtquate warning devices . . . on any project where Federal-aidfunds participate in the installation of the devices are toinclude automatic gates with flashing light signals" if anyof several conditions are present. Those conditions include (A) "[m]ultiple main line railroad tracks," (B) multipletracks in the vicinity such that one train might "obscurethe movement of another train approaching the crossing,"(C) high speed trains combined with limited sight distances, (D) a "combination of high speeds and moderatelyhigh volumes of highway and railroad traffic," (E) the useof the crossing by "substantial numbers of schoolbuses ortrucks carrying hazardous materials," or (F) when a "diagnostic team recommends them." $ 646.214(b)(3)(i). Subsection (b)(4) states that "[f]or crossings where the requirements of $ 646.214(b)(3) are not applicable, the type ofwarning device to be installed, whether the determination ismade by a State regulatory agency, State highway agency,and/or the railroad, is subject to the approval of FHWA."Thus, at crossings where any of the conditions listed in (b)(3)exist, adequate warning devices, if installed using federalfunds, are automatic gates and flashing lights.

CO. v. SHANKLINOpinion of the CourtBShortly after 5 a.m. on October 3, 1993, Eddie Shanklindrove his truck eastward on Oakwood Church Road inGibson County, Tennessee. App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a. AsShanklin crossed the railroad tracks that intersect the road,he was struck and killed by a train operated by petitioner.Ibid. At the time of the accident, the Oakwood ChurchRoad crossing was equipped with advance warning signs andreflectorized crossbucks, id., at 34a, the familiar black-and-white, X-shaped signs that read "RAILROAD CROSSING,"see U. S. Dept. of Transportation, Federal Highway Adminis-tration, Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices $ 8B-2(1988) (MUTCD). The Tennessee Department of Transpor-tation (TDOT) had installed the signs in 1987 with federalfunds received under the Crossings Program. App. to Pet.for Cert. 3a. The TDOT had requested the funds as partof a project to install such signs at 196 grade crossings in11 Tennessee counties. See App. 128-131. That requestcontained information about each crossing covered by theproject, including the presence or absence of several of thefactors listed in $ 646.214(b)(3). See id., at 134. TheFHWA approved the project, App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a,and federal funds accounted for 99% of the cost of installingthe signs at the crossings, see App. 133. It is undisputedthat the signs at the Oakwood Church Road crossing wereinstalled and fully compliant with the federal standards forsuch devices at the time of the accident.Following the accident, Mr. Shanklin's widow, respondentDedra Shanklin, brought this diversity wrongful death actionagainst petitioner in the United States District Court for theWestern District of Tennessee. Id., at 29-34. Respond-ent's claims were based on Tennessee statutory and commonlaw. Id., at 31-33. She alleged that petitioner had beennegligent in several respects, including by failing to maintainadequate warning devices at the crossing. Ibid. Petitionermoved for summary judgment on the ground that the FRSA529US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-01 10:03:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN351Cite as: 529 U. S. 344 (2000)Opinion of the Courtpre-empted respondent's suit. App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a.The District Court held that respondent's allegation that thesigns installed at the crossing were inadequate was not pre-empted.Id., at 29a-37a. Respondent thus presented herinadequate warning device claim and three other allegationsof negligence to a jury, which found that petitioner andMr. Shanklin had both been negligent. App. 47. The juryassigned 70% responsibility to petitioner and 30% to Mr.Shanklin, and it assessed damages of $615,379.Ibid. TheDistrict Court accordingly entered judgment of $430,765.30for respondent.Id., at 48.The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, holding that the FRSA did not pre-empt respondent's claim thatthe devices at the crossing were inadequate. 173 F. 3d 386(1999). It reasoned that federal funding alone is insufficientto trigger pre-emption of state tort actions under the FRSAand $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4). Id., at 394. Instead, the railroad must establish that $ 646.214(b)(3) or (4) was "applied"to the crossing at issue, meaning that the FHWA affirmatively approved the particular devices installed at the crossing as adequate for safety. Id., at 397. The court concludedthat, because the TDOT had installed the signs for the purpose of providing "minimum protection" at the OakwoodChurch Road crossing, there had been no such individualizeddetermination of adequacy.We granted certiorari, 528 U. S. 949 (1999), to resolve aconflict among the Courts of Appeals as to whether theFRSA, by virtue of 23 CFR $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) (1999),pre-empts state tort claims concerning a railroad's failure tomaintain adequate warning devices at crossings where federal funds have participated in the installation of the devices.Compare Ingram v. CSX Transp., Inc., 146 F. 3d 858 (CA111998) (holding that federal funding of crossing improvementtriggers pre-emption under FRSA); Armijo v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. Co., 87 F. 3d 1188 (CA10 1996) (same);Elrod v. Burlington Northern R. Co., 68 F. 3d 241 (CA8 1995)529US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-01 10:03:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN352 NORFOLK SOUTHERN R. CO. v.

CSX Transp., Inc., 38 F. 3d304 (CA7 1994) (no pre-emption until representative of Federal Government has determined that devices installed areadequate for safety).IIWe previously addressed the pre-emptive effect of theFHWA's regulations implementing the Crossings Program inCSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood, 507 U. S. 658 (1993). Inthat case, we explained that the language of the FRSA'spre-emption provision dictates that, to pre-empt state law,the federal regulation must "cover" the same subject matter,and not merely " `touch upon' or `relate to' that subject mat-ter." Id., at 664; see also 49 U. S. C. $ 20106. Thus, "preemption will lie only if the federal regulations substantiallysubsume the subject matter of the relevant state law." Easterwood, supra, at 664. Applying this standard, we con-cluded that the regulations contained in 23 CFR pt. 924(1999), which "establish the general terms of the bargain be-tween the Federal and State Governments" for the Crossings Program, are not pre-emptive. 507 U. S., at 667. Wealso held that $ 646.214(b)(1), which requires that all trafficcontrol devices installed under the program comply with theMUTCD, does not pre-empt state tort actions.Id., at 668-670. The MUTCD "provides a description of, rather thana prescription for, the allocation of responsibility for gradecrossing safety between Federal and State Governments andbetween States and railroads," and hence "disavows anyclaim to cover the subject matter of that body of law." Id.,at 669-670.With respect to $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4), however, wereached a different conclusion. Because those regulations"establish requirements as to the installation of particularwarning devices," we held that "when they are applicable,state tort law is pre-empted."Id., at 670. Unlike the other529US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-01 10:03:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN353Cite as: 529 U. S. 344 (2000)Opinion of the Courtregulations, "$$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) displace state and pri-vate decisionmaking authority by establishing a federal-lawrequirement that certain protective devices be installed orfederal approval obtained."Ibid. As a result, those regulations "effectively set the terms under which railroads areto participate in the improvement of crossings."Ibid.In Easterwood itself, we ultimately concluded that theplaintiff 's state tort claim was not pre-empted. Ibid. Ashere, the plaintiff brought a wrongful death action allegingthat the railroad had not maintained adequate warning de-vices at a particular grade crossing.Id., at 661. We heldthat $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) were not applicable because thewarning devices for which federal funds had been obtainedwere never actually installed at the crossing where the accident occurred. Id., at 671-673. Nonetheless, we madeclear that, when they do apply, $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) "coverthe subject matter of state law which, like the tort law onwhich respondent relies, seeks to impose an independentduty on a railroad to identify and/or repair dangerous crossings." Id., at 671. The sole question in this case, then, iswhether $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) "are applicable" to all warning devices actually installed with federal funds.We believe that Easterwood answers this question aswell. As an original matter, one could plausibly read$$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) as being purely definitional, establishing a standard for the adequacy of federally funded warningdevices but not requiring that all such devices meet thatstandard. Easterwood rejected this approach, however, andheld that the requirements spelled out in (b)(3) and (4) aremandatory for all warning devices installed with federalfunds. "[F]or projects that involve grade crossings . . . inwhich `Federal-aid funds participate in the installation of the[warning] devices,' regulations specify warning devices thatmust be installed." Id., at 666 (emphasis added). Once itis accepted that the regulations are not merely definitional,their scope is plain: They apply to "any project where529US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-01 10:03:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN354 NORFOLK SOUTHERN R. CO. v. SHANKLINOpinion of the CourtFederal-aid funds participate in the installation of the de-vices." 23 CFR $ 646.214(b)(3)(i) (1999).Sections 646.214(b)(3) and (4) therefore establish a stand-ard of adequacy that "determine[s] the devices to be installed" when federal funds participate in the crossing im-provement project. Easterwood, 507 U. S., at 671. If acrossing presents those conditions listed in (b)(3), the Statemust install automatic gates and flashing lights; if the (b)(3)factors are absent, (b)(4) dictates that the decision as to whatdevices to install is subject to FHWA approval. Seeid., at670-671. In either case, $ 646.214(b)(3) or (4) "is applicable"and determines the type of warning device that is "ade-quate" under federal law. As a result, once the FHWA hasfunded the crossing improvement and the warning devicesare actually installed and operating, the regulation "displace[s] state and private decisionmaking authority by estab-lishing a federal-law requirement that certain protective devices be installed or federal approval obtained." Id., at 670.Importantly, this is precisely the interpretation of$$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) that the FHWA endorsed in Easterwood. Appearing as amicus curiae, the Government ex-plained that $ 646.214(b) "establishes substantive standardsfor what constitutes adequate safety devices on grade cross-ing improvement projects financed with federal funds."Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in CSX Transp.,Inc. v. Easterwood, O. T. 1992, Nos. 91-790 and 91-1206, p. 23.As a result, $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) "cover the subject matterof adequate safety devices at crossings that have been improved with the use of federal funds." Ibid. More specifi-cally, the Government stated that $ 646.214(b)"requires gate arms in certain circumstances, and re-quires FHWA approval of the safety devices in all othercircumstances. Thus, the warning devices in place at acrossing improved with the use of federal funds have, bydefinition, been specifically found to be adequate under aregulation issued by the Secretary. Any state rule that529US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-01 10:03:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN355Cite as: 529 U. S. 344 (2000)Opinion of the Courtmore or different crossing devices were necessary at afederally funded crossing is therefore preempted." Id.,at 24.Thus, Easterwood adopted the FHWA's own understandingof the application of $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4), a regulation thatthe agency had been administering for 17 years.Respondent and the Government now argue that$$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) are more limited in scope and onlyapply where the warning devices have been selected basedon diagnostic studies and particularized analyses of the con-ditions at the crossing. See Brief for Respondent 16, 24;Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22 (hereinafterBrief for United States). They contend that the CrossingsProgram actually comprises two distinct programs--the"minimum protection" program and the "priority" or "hazard" program. See Brief for Respondent 1-7; Brief forUnited States 15-21. Under the "minimum protection" program, they argue, States obtain federal funds merely toequip crossings with advance warning signs and reflectorizedcrossbucks, the bare minimum required by the MUTCD,without any judgment as to whether the signs are adequate.See Brief for Respondent 5-7, 30-36; Brief for United States15-21. Under the "priority" or "hazard" program, in contrast, diagnostic teams conduct individualized assessments ofparticular crossings, and state or FHWA officials make specific judgments about the adequacy of the warning devicesusing the criteria set out in $ 646.214(b)(3). See Brief forRespondent 5-7, 34-35; Brief for United States 18-21.They therefore contend that (b)(3) and (4) only apply to devices installed under the "priority" or "hazard" program,when a diagnostic team has actually applied the decisionalprocess mandated by (b)(3). See Brief for Respondent 16;Brief for United States 18-25. Only then has the regulationprescribed a federal standard for the adequacy of the warn-ing devices that displaces state law covering the samesubject.529US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-01 10:03:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN356 NORFOLK SOUTHERN R. CO. v. SHANKLINOpinion of the CourtThis construction, however, contradicts the regulation'splain text. Sections 646.214(b)(3) and (4) make no distinction between devices installed for "minimum protection" andthose installed under a so-called "priority" or "hazard" program. Nor does their applicability depend on any individu-alized determination of adequacy by a diagnostic team or anFHWA official. Rather, as the FHWA itself explained in itsEasterwood brief, $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) have a "compre-hensive scope." Brief for United States inCSX Transp.,Inc. v. Easterwood, O. T. 1992, Nos. 91-790 and 91-1206, at12. Section 646.214(b)(3) states that its requirements applyto "any project where Federal-aid funds participate in theinstallation of the devices." 23 CFR $ 646.214(b)(3)(i) (1999)(emphasis added). And $ 646.214(b)(4) applies to all federally funded crossings that do not meet the criteria specifiedin (b)(3). Either way, the federal standard for adequacyapplies to the crossing improvement and "substantiallysubsume[s] the subject matter of the relevant state law."Easterwood, 507 U. S., at 664.Thus, contrary to the Government's positi on here,$$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) "specify warning devices that mustbe installed" as a part of all federally funded crossing improvements. Id., at 666. Although generally "an agency'sconstruction of its own regulations is entitled to substantialdeference," Lyng v. Payne, 476 U. S. 926, 939 (1986), no suchdeference is appropriate here. Not only is the FHWA's interpretation inconsistent with the text of $$ 646.214(b)(3) and(4), see Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490U. S. 332, 359 (1989), but it also contradicts the agency's ownprevious construction that this Court adopted as authoritative in Easterwood, cf. Maislin Industries, U. S., Inc. v. Primary Steel, Inc., 497 U. S. 116, 131 (1990) ("Once we havedetermined a statute's clear meaning, we adhere to that determination under the doctrine of stare decisis, and we judgean agency's later interpretation of the statute against ourprior determination of the statute's meaning").529US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-01 10:03:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN357Cite as: 529 U. S. 344 (2000)Opinion of the CourtThe dissent contends that, under our holding, state law ispre-empted even though "[n]o authority, federal or state, hasfound that the signs in place" are "adequate to protectsafety."Post, at 360 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.). This presupposes that States have not fulfilled their obligation tocomply with $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4). Those subsections establish a standard for adequacy that States are required tofollow in determining what devices to install when federalfunds are used. The dissent also argues thatEasterwooddid not hold that federal funding of the devices is "sufficient"to effect pre-emption, and that "any statement as to the automatic preemptive effect of federal funding should have remained open for reconsideration in a later case." Post,at 361. But Easterwood did not, in fact, leave this questionopen. Instead, at the behest of the FHWA, the Courtclearly stated that $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) pre-empt statetort claims concerning the adequacy of all warning devicesinstalled with the participation of federal funds.Respondent also argues that pre-emption does not lie inthis particular case because the Oakwood Church Roadcrossing presented several of the factors listed in$ 646.214(b)(3), and because the TDOT did not install pavement markings as required by the MUTCD. See Brief forRespondent 20-22, 36; Brief in Opposition 6-8. This misconceives how pre-emption operates under these circumstances. When the FHWA approves a crossing improvement project and the State installs the warning devicesusing federal funds, $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) establish a federal standard for the adequacy of those devices that displacesstate tort law addressing the same subject. At that point,the regulation dictates "the devices to be installed and themeans by which railroads are to participate in their selection." Easterwood, supra, at 671. It is this displacementof state law concerning the devices' adequacy, and not theState's or the FHWA's adherence to the standard set outin $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) or to the requirements of the529US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-01 10:03:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN358 NORFOLK SOUTHERN R. CO. v. SHANKLINOpinion of the CourtMUTCD, that pre-empts state tort actions. Whether theState should have originally installed different or additionaldevices, or whether conditions at the crossing have sincechanged such that automatic gates and flashing lights wouldbe appropriate, is immaterial to the pre-emption question.It should be noted that nothing prevents a State from revisiting the adequacy of devices installed using federal funds.States are free to install more protective devices at suchcrossings with their own funds or with additional fundingfrom the FHWA. What States cannot do--once they haveinstalled federally funded devices at a particular crossing--is hold the railroad responsible for the adequacy of those devices. The dissent objects that this bestows on railroads a"double windfall": The Federal Government pays for the installation of the devices, and the railroad is simultaneouslyabsolved of state tort liability. Post, at 360-361. But thesame is true of the result urged by respondent and the Government. Respondent and the Government acknowledgethat $$ 646.214(b)(3) and (4) can pre-empt state tort law, butthey argue that pre-emption only occurs when the State hasinstalled the devices pursuant to a diagnostic team's analysisof the crossing in question. Under this reading, railroadswould receive the same "double windfall"--federal fundingof the devices and pre-emption of state tort law--so long asa diagnostic team has evaluated the crossing. The supposedconferral of a "windfall" on the railroads therefore casts nodoubt on our construction of the regulation.Sections 646.214(b)(3) and (4) "cover the subject matter"of the adequacy of warning devices installed with the participation of federal funds. As a result, the FRSA pre-emptsrespondent's state tort claim that the advance warningsigns and reflectorized crossbucks installed at the OakwoodChurch Road crossing were inadequate. Because the TDOTused federal funds for the signs' installation, $$ 646.214(b)(3)and (4) governed the selection and installation of the devices.And because the TDOT determined that warning devices529US2 Unit: $U45 [09-26-01 10:03:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN359Cite as: 529 U. S. 344 (2000)concurringother than automatic gates and flashing lights were appro-priate, its decision was subject to the approval of the FHWA.See $ 646.214(b)(4). Once the FHWA approved the projectand the signs were installed using federal funds, the federalstandard for adequacy displaced Tennessee statutory andcommon law addressing the same subject, thereby preempting respondent's claim.The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuitis reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.
