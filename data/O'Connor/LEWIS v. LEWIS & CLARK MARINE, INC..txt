This case concerns a seaman's ability to sue a vessel ownerin state court for personal injuries sustained aboard a vessel.Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over admiraltyand maritime claims, but the jurisdictional statute "sav[es]to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they areotherwise entitled." 28 U. S. C. $ 1333(1). Another statutegrants vessel owners the right to seek limited liability infederal court for claims of damage aboard their vessels. 46U. S. C. App. $ 181 et seq. In this case, the District Court,after conducting proceedings to preserve the vessel owner'sright to seek limited liability, dissolved the injunction thatprevented the seaman from litigating his personal injuryclaims in state court. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appealsreversed, concluding that the vessel owner had a right tocontest liability in federal court, and that the seaman did nothave a saved remedy in state court. The question presentedis whether the District Court abused its discretion in dissolv-ing the injunction.IPetitioner, James F. Lewis, worked as a deckhand aboardthe M/V Karen Michelle, owned by respondent, Lewis &Clark Marine, Inc. Petitioner claims that on March 17, 1998,he was injured aboard the M/V Karen Michelle when hetripped over a wire and hurt his back. App. 12. In April1998, petitioner sued respondent in the Circuit Court of Mad531US2 Unit: $U24 [04-12-02 19:31:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN441Cite as: 531 U. S. 438 (2001)Opinion of the Courtison County, Illinois. Petitioner claimed negligence underthe Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 688, unseaworthiness, andmaintenance and cure. A Jones Act claim is an in personamaction for a seaman who suffers injury in the course of employment due to negligence of his employer, the vesselowner, or crew members.Ibid.; Plamals v. S. S. "PinarDel Rio," 277 U. S. 151, 155-156 (1928). Unseaworthiness isa claim under general maritime law based on the vessel own-er's duty to ensure that the vessel is reasonably fit to be atsea. See generally Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., 362 U. S.539, 550 (1960). A claim for maintenance and cure concernsthe vessel owner's obligation to provide food, lodging, andmedical services to a seaman injured while serving the ship.See generally Calmar S. S. Corp. v. Taylor, 303 U. S. 525,527-528 (1938). Petitioner did not demand a jury trial instate court.In anticipation of petitioner's suit, respondent had filed acomplaint for exoneration from, or limitation of, liability inthe United States District Court for the Eastern District ofMissouri pursuant to the Limitation of Liability Act (Limitation Act or Act), 46 U. S. C. App. $ 181 et seq. The DistrictCourt followed the procedure for a limitation action providedin Supplemental Admiralty and Maritime Claims Rule F.The court entered an order approving a surety bond of$450,000, representing respondent's interest in the vessel.The court ordered that any person with a claim for theevents of March 17, 1998, file a claim with the court withina specified period. The court then enjoined the filing orprosecution of any suits against respondent related to theincident on March 17, 1998. App. 30-33.Petitioner filed an answer to respondent's complaint, aclaim for damages for injury, and a motion to dissolve therestraining order. Petitioner averred that he was the soleclaimant concerning the events of March 17, 1998. Hewaived any claim of res judicata concerning limited liabilitybased on a state court judgment; he stipulated that respond531US2 Unit: $U24 [04-12-02 19:31:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN442 LEWIS v. LEWIS & CLARK MARINE, INC.Opinion of the Courtent could relitigate issues relating to the limitation of liabil-ity in District Court.Id., at 72. Petitioner later stipulatedthat the value of his claim was less than the value of thelimitation fund,id., at 102, recanting his earlier allegationthat his claim exceeded the vessel's value.The District Court dissolved the restraining order thatprevented petitioner from proceeding with his cause of action in state court. In re Complaint of Lewis & Clark Marine, Inc., 31 F. Supp. 2d 1164 (ED Mo. 1998). The courtrecognized that federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction todetermine whether a vessel owner is entitled to limited liability. The court also noted, however, that the statute thatconfers exclusive jurisdiction over admiralty and maritimeclaims to federal courts contains a clause that saves to suitors "all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled." 28 U. S. C. $ 1333(1). The court reasoned that "a tension exists between the exclusive jurisdiction vested in theadmiralty courts to determine a vessel owner's right to limited liability and the savings to suitors clause." 31 F. Supp.2d, at 1168.The District Court found two exceptions to exclusive federal jurisdiction under which a claimant is allowed to litigatehis claim in state court. The first is where the value of thelimitation fund exceeds the total value of all claims assertedagainst the vessel owner. The second is where a singleclaimant brings an action against the vessel owner seekingdamages in excess of the value of the vessel. The court concluded that it should dissolve the injunction in this case because petitioner met the limited fund exception and probablymet the single claimant exception as well. Id., at 1169, andn. 3. The court decided to retain jurisdiction over the limitation action to protect the vessel owner's right to limitationin the event that the state proceedings necessitated furtherproceedings in federal court.The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the DistrictCourt abused its discretion in dissolving the injunction. 196531US2 Unit: $U24 [04-12-02 19:31:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN443Cite as: 531 U. S. 438 (2001)Opinion of the CourtF. 3d 900 (1999). The Court of Appeals, like the DistrictCourt, recognized potential tension between the saving tosuitors clause in the jurisdictional statute and the LimitationAct. The Court of Appeals, however, perceived no conflictbetween those provisions in the instant case. The Court ofAppeals explained that a court must consider whether thevessel owner has the right to remain in federal court andwhether the claimant is seeking a saved remedy in anotherforum. The court concluded that respondent had a right toseek exoneration from liability, not merely limitation of liability, in federal court. The court also concluded that because petitioner did not request a trial by jury, he had notsought a saved remedy in state court. The court determined that there was no substantive difference between theremedies afforded petitioner in state court and federal court.For these reasons, the court held that there was no basis fordissolving the injunction.We granted certiorari, 530 U. S. 1202 (2000), to resolve aconflict between the Eighth Circuit's decision and the decisions of other Courts of Appeals. Compare 196 F. 3d 900(CA8 1999), with Kreta Shipping S. A. v. Preussag International Steel Corp., 192 F. 3d 41 (CA2 1999), Beiswenger Enterprises Corp. v. Carletta, 86 F. 3d 1032 (CA11 1996), andLinton v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 964 F. 2d 1480(CA5 1992).IIAArticle III, $ 2, of the United States Constitution vests federal courts with jurisdiction over all cases of admiralty andmaritime jurisdiction. Section 9 of the Judiciary Act of 1789codified this grant of exclusive original jurisdiction, but"sav[ed] to suitors, in all cases, the right of a common lawremedy, where the common law is competent to give it."Ch. 20, $ 9, 1 Stat. 77. In the intervening years, Congresshas revised the language of the saving to suitors clause, but531US2 Unit: $U24 [04-12-02 19:31:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN444 LEWIS v. LEWIS & CLARK MARINE, INC.Opinion of the Courtits substance has remained largely unchanged. See 28U. S. C. $$ 41(3) and 371 Third (1940 ed.) ("saving to suitorsin all cases the right of a common-law remedy where thecommon law is competent to give it"); 28 U. S. C. $ 1333(1)(1946 ed., Supp. II) ("saving to the libellant or petitioner inevery case any other remedy to which he is otherwise entitled"); Act of May 24, 1949, ch. 139, $ 79, 63 Stat. 101 ("savingto suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they areotherwise entitled"). The jurisdictional statute now statesthat "[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction, ex-clusive of the courts of the States, of . . . any civil case ofadmiralty or maritime jurisdiction, saving to suitors in allcases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled." 28 U. S. C. $ 1333(1) (emphasis added).What the drafters of the Judiciary Act intended in creatingthe saving to suitors clause is not entirely clear and has beenthe subject of some debate. See, e. g., 1 J. Goebel, Antecedents and Beginnings to 1801, History of the Supreme Courtof the United States 474 (1971). Compare Casto, The Origins of Federal Admiralty Jurisdiction in an Age of Privateers, Smugglers, and Pirates, 37 Am. J. Legal Hist. 117,139-149 (1993), with Gutoff, Original Understandings andthe Private Law Origins of the Federal Admiralty Jurisdiction, A Reply to Professor Casto, 30 J. Mar. L. & Com. 361,387-390 (1999). This Court theorized that the saving tosuitors clause was "inserted, probably, from abundant caution, lest the exclusive terms in which the power is conferredon the District Courts might be deemed to have taken awaythe concurrent remedy which had before existed. Thisleaves the concurrent power where it stood at common law."New Jersey Steam Nav. Co. v. Merchants' Bank of Boston, 6How. 344, 390 (1848).In early cases we defined the limits of the clause. Forinstance, proceedings in rem were deemed outside the scopeof the clause because an in rem action was not a common lawremedy, but instead a proceeding under civil law. See, e. g.,531US2 Unit: $U24 [04-12-02 19:31:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN445Cite as: 531 U. S. 438 (2001)Opinion of the CourtThe Hine v. Trevor, 4 Wall. 555, 571-572 (1867); The MosesTaylor, 4 Wall. 411, 431 (1867). We later distinguished between the concept of rights and remedies. Chelentis v.Luckenbach S. S. Co., 247 U. S. 372, 383-384 (1918). In Chelentis, we held that maritime law governs a seaman's rightto recovery against a vessel owner for his injuries aboard thevessel. We explained that "[t]he distinction between rightsand remedies is fundamental. A right is a well founded oracknowledged claim; a remedy is the means employed to enforce a right or redress an injury." Id., at 384.In a subsequent case, the Court defined the saving to suitors clause as a grant to state courts of in personam jurisdiction, concurrent with admiralty courts. Red Cross Line v.Atlantic Fruit Co., 264 U. S. 109, 123 (1924). We held enforceable an arbitration agreement between an owner of asteamship and a company that chartered the ship. We reasoned that agreements to arbitrate were valid under admiralty law, and that the State of New York had the power toconfer on its courts the authority to compel parties to submitto arbitration. We explained that the state arbitration lawmerely provided a remedy in state court:"The `right of a common law remedy,' so saved to suitors, does not . . . include attempted changes by theStates in the substantive admiralty law, but it does include all means other than proceedings in admiraltywhich may be employed to enforce the right or to redress the injury involved. It includes remedies in pais,as well as proceedings in court; judicial remedies conferred by statute, as well as those existing at the common law; remedies in equity, as well as those enforceablein a court of law." Id., at 123-124.Thus, the saving to suitors clause preserves remedies andthe concurrent jurisdiction of state courts over some admiralty and maritime claims. See also Madruga v. Superior531US2 Unit: $U24 [04-12-02 19:31:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN446 LEWIS v. LEWIS & CLARK MARINE, INC.Opinion of the CourtCourt of Cal., County of San Diego, 346 U. S. 556, 560-561(1954); Steamboat Co. v. Chase, 16 Wall. 522, 533-534 (1873).BAdmiralty and maritime law includes a host of specialrights, duties, rules, and procedures. See, e. g., 46 U. S. C.App. $ 721 et seq. (wrecks and salvage); $ 741 et seq. (suits inadmiralty by or against vessels or cargoes of the UnitedStates); 46 U. S. C. $ 10101 et seq. (merchant seamen protec-tion and relief). Among these provisions is the LimitationAct, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 181 et seq. The Act allows a vesselowner to limit liability for damage or injury, occasioned without the owner's privity or knowledge, to the value of thevessel or the owner's interest in the vessel. The centralprovision of the Act provides:"The liability of the owner of any vessel, whetherAmerican or foreign, for any embezzlement, loss, or destruction by any person of any property, goods, or mer-chandise shipped or put on board of such vessel, or forany loss, damage, or injury by collision, or for any act,matter, or thing, loss, damage, or forfeiture, done, occasioned, or incurred, without the privity or knowledgeof such owner or owners, shall not, except in the casesprovided for in subsection (b) of this section, exceed theamount or value of the interest of such owner in suchvessel, and her freight then pending." $ 183(a).See also $ 183(b) (requiring supplemental fund for some ves-sels for personal injury and death claimants).Congress passed the Limitation Act in 1851 "to encourageship-building and to induce capitalists to invest money in thisbranch of industry." Norwich Co. v. Wright, 13 Wall. 104,121 (1872). See alsoBritish Transport Comm'n v. UnitedStates, 354 U. S. 129, 133-135 (1957); Just v. Chambers, 312U. S. 383, 385 (1941). The Act also had the purpose of "put-ting American shipping upon an equality with that of other531US2 Unit: $U24 [04-12-02 19:31:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN447Cite as: 531 U. S. 438 (2001)Opinion of the Courtmaritime nations" that had their own limitation acts. TheMain v. Williams, 152 U. S. 122, 128 (1894). See also Norwich Co., supra, at 116-119 (discussing history of limitationacts in England, France, and the States that led to the passage of the Limitation Act).The Act is not a model of clarity. See 2 T. Schoenbaum,Admiralty and Maritime Law 299 (2d ed. 1994) ("Th[e] 1851Act, badly drafted even by the standards of the time, contin-ues in effect today"). Having created a right to seek limitedliability, Congress did not provide procedures for determin-ing the entitlement. This Court did not have an opportunityto review the Act in detail until 20 years after its enactment.See Norwich Co., supra. Deeming the Act "incapable of execution" without further instructions to courts, id., at 123,we designed the procedures that govern a limitation action,and promulgated them the same Term, see SupplementaryRules of Practice in Admiralty, 13 Wall. xii-xiv. We laterexplained that the scheme "was sketched in outline" by theAct, and "the regulation of details as to the form and modesof proceeding was left to be prescribed by judicial authority."Providence & New York S. S. Co. v. Hill Mfg. Co., 109 U. S.578, 590 (1883).The 1872 rules were "intended to facilitate the proceedings of the owners of vessels for claiming the limitation ofliability secured by the statute." The "Benefactor," 103U. S. 239, 244 (1880). Under the rules, a vessel owner seeking limitation of liability had to file a petition. The districtcourt would obtain an appraisal of the vessel's value or theowner's interest in the vessel, and ensure that payment orsome guarantee of payment was deposited with the court.The court would then order all claimants to appear. Supplementary Rule of Practice in Admiralty 54, 13 Wall., at xii-xiii. In the process of seeking limited liability, the ownerwas permitted to contest the fact of liability. Rule 56, 13Wall., at xiii. The ability to contest liability relieved vesselowners of the "very onerous" English rule, which required531US2 Unit: $U24 [04-12-02 19:31:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN448 LEWIS v. LEWIS & CLARK MARINE, INC.Opinion of the Courtvessel owners to confess liability in order to seek the bene-fit of limitation. The "Benefactor," supra, at 243 ("[T]hiscourt, in preparing the rules of procedure for a limitationof liability, deemed it proper to allow a party seeking suchlimitation to contest any liability whatever"). The claim-ants would then contest the vessel owner's claims for exoneration and limitation of liability. Rule 56, 13 Wall., at xiii.If the owner succeeded in its effort to limit liability, but wasnot exonerated, the court was responsible for distributingthe fund deposited in the court among the claimants. Rule55, 13 Wall., at xiii.The procedure for a limitation action is now found in Supplemental Admiralty and Maritime Claims Rule F. Muchlike its predecessor provisions, Rule F sets forth the processfor filing a complaint seeking exoneration from, or limita-tion of, liability. The district court secures the value of thevessel or owner's interest, marshals claims, and enjoins theprosecution of other actions with respect to the claims. Inthese proceedings, the court, sitting without a jury, adjudi-cates the claims. The court determines whether the vesselowner is liable and whether the owner may limit liability.The court then determines the validity of the claims, and ifliability is limited, distributes the limited fund among theclaimants.CSome tension exists between the saving to suitors clauseand the Limitation Act. One statute gives suitors the rightto a choice of remedies, and the other statute gives vesselowners the right to seek limitation of liability in federalcourt. We confronted this tension in Langnes v. Green, 282U. S. 531 (1931). The respondent inLangnes was employedon the petitioner's vessel. The employee sued the vesselowner in state court for $25,000 for personal injuries sufferedaboard the vessel. The vessel owner later filed a petitionfor limitation of liability in Federal District Court. The Dis-trict Court enjoined any further proceedings in state court531US2 Unit: $U24 [04-12-02 19:31:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN449Cite as: 531 U. S. 438 (2001)Opinion of the Courtand issued a notice that all claimants appear. The employeefiled his claim in District Court. The parties stipulated thatthe vessel was worth no more than $5,000.The employee sought dissolution of the injunction. He argued that the state court had jurisdiction over his claim, thathe was the only possible claimant, that there was only onevessel owner, and therefore the vessel owner could claim thebenefit of the Limitation Act by proper pleading in statecourt. The District Court denied the motion and proceededto decide the merits, concluding that the vessel owner wasnot liable. The Court of Appeals reversed on the issue oflimitation.On review, this Court concluded that both courts erred infailing to recognize that the state court was competent tohear the employee's personal injury claim and the vesselowner's claim for limitation. In our view, the choice beforethe District Court was whether it should retain the limitation action and preserve the right of the vessel owner butdestroy the right of the employee in state court to a commonlaw remedy, or allow the action in state court to proceed andpreserve the rights of both parties. We concluded that thelatter course was just. We decided that the District Courtshould have dissolved the injunction and allowed the employee to proceed with his claim in state court, and retainedjurisdiction over the petition for limitation of liability in theevent that the state proceedings necessitated further proceedings in federal court. We explained that the DistrictCourt's decision is "one of discretion in every case," and remanded for further proceedings. Id., at 544.After our decision, the employee was permitted to pursuehis claim in state court. See Ex parte Green, 286 U. S. 437(1932). In those proceedings, notwithstanding this Court'srecognition of the vessel owner's right to seek limitation ofliability in federal court, the employee sought to litigate thatissue in state court. We approved of the District Court'sdecision to enjoin any further proceedings in state court until531US2 Unit: $U24 [04-12-02 19:31:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN450 LEWIS v. LEWIS & CLARK MARINE, INC.Opinion of the Courtthe employee agreed to withdraw his submission on the issueof limited liability.Id., at 440.We have also considered the conflict between the saving tosuitors clause and the Limitation Act in a case where severalclaimants attempted to sue a vessel owner in state court.Lake Tankers Corp. v. Henn, 354 U. S. 147 (1957). A pleasure yacht, the Blackstone, capsized after a collision with atug that was push-towing a barge, injuring several personsand killing one. Claimants sued the owner of the tug andbarge in state court actions. The owner filed a petition forexoneration from, or limitation of, liability in federal court.The owner also filed a bond for the tug in the amount ofapproximately $119,000 and a bond for the barge in theamount of $165,000. The District Court enjoined other proceedings concerning the collision. Thereafter, the claimantsmade their demands for damages; the total claims were lessthan the amount of the two bonds. All claimants relinquished any right to damages in excess of that set forth intheir claims. They further waived any claim of res judicatarelating to the issue of the vessel owner's ability to limitliability. The District Court decided to dissolve the injunction because the total limitation fund exceeded the amountof the claims. The Court of Appeals affirmed.We affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision. In examiningthe Limitation Act and its history, we found it "crystal clearthat the operation of the Act is directed at misfortunes atsea where the losses incurred exceed the value of the vesseland the pending freight." Id., at 151. Where the value ofthe vessel and the pending freight exceed the claims, however, there is no necessity for the maintenance of the actionin federal court. Id., at 152. The stipulations, in additionto other restrictions on the state court proceedings, ensured"beyond doubt that [the owner's] right of limitation underthe Act was fully protected." Ibid. We explained that toexpand the scope of exclusive jurisdiction to prevent thestate court actions531US2 Unit: $U24 [04-12-02 19:31:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN451Cite as: 531 U. S. 438 (2001)Opinion of the Court"would transform the Act from a protective instrumentto an offensive weapon by which the shipowner coulddeprive suitors of their common-law rights, even wherethe limitation fund is known to be more than adequateto satisfy all demands upon it. The shipowner's rightto limit liability is not so boundless. The Act is not oneof immunity from liability but of limitation of it and weread no other privilege for the shipowner into its language over and above that granting him limited liability.In fact, the Congress not only created the limitationprocedure for the primary purpose of apportioning thelimitation fund among the claimants where that fundwas inadequate to pay the claims in full, but it reservedto such suitors their common-law remedies."Id., at152-153.Since these decisions, the Courts of Appeals have generallypermitted claimants to proceed with their claims in statecourt where there is only a single claimant, as in Langnes,or where the total claims do not exceed the value of the limitation fund, as in Lake Tankers. See, e. g., Beiswenger En-terprises Corp. v. Carletta, 86 F. 3d 1032 (CA11 1996); Lintonv. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 964 F. 2d 1480 (CA5 1992).See also Kreta Shipping S. A. v. Preussag InternationalSteel Corp., 192 F. 3d 41 (CA2 1999) (foreign forum).IIIIn the instant case, we believe that the District Courtproperly exercised its discretion in dissolving the injunctionthat prevented petitioner from pursuing his claims in statecourt. The District Court, guided by our prior cases, attempted to reconcile petitioner's right to his remedy underthe saving to suitors clause with respondent's right to seeklimited liability under the Limitation Act. The court dis-solved the injunction against the state court proceedingsafter it concluded that respondent's right to seek limitationof liability would be adequately protected. Respondent's531US2 Unit: $U24 [04-12-02 19:31:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN452 LEWIS v. LEWIS & CLARK MARINE, INC.Opinion of the Courtrights were protected by petitioner's stipulation that hisclaim did not exceed the limitation fund, petitioner's waiverof any defense of res judicata with respect to limitation ofliability, and the District Court's decision to stay the Limitation Act proceedings pending state court proceedings.The Eighth Circuit held that the District Court should nothave dissolved the injunction without first "finding . . . actualstatutory conflict between the Limitation Act and the `savingto suitors' clause in the case at bar." 196 F. 3d, at 906. TheCourt of Appeals concluded that there was no conflict herebecause respondent had a right to seek exoneration from liability in federal court, and petitioner did not have a savedremedy under the saving to suitors clause. That reasoningmisapprehends this Court's prior decisions.In this case, there was a conflict between the saving tosuitors clause and the Limitation Act. Petitioner sued respondent in state court; under the saving to suitors clause,that court had jurisdiction to hear his claims. Respondentsought limited liability for petitioner's claims in federalcourt; the Limitation Act granted the federal court jurisdiction over that action. Both parties selected legitimateforums for their claims, and therein lies the conflict. Hadpetitioner sought to institute in rem proceedings against respondent in state court, that court would have lacked jurisdiction because the saving to suitors clause does not reachactions in rem. Similarly, had respondent sought limitedliability for payment of wages in federal court, that courtwould not have had jurisdiction under the Limitation Actbecause claims for wages due employees are not covered.46 U. S. C. App. $ 189. See also In re East River TowingCo., 266 U. S. 355, 367 (1924). Here, however, there appearsto have been no obstacle to each party pursuing its claim inthe forum of its choice, except the competing action.In deciding that the case should proceed in federal court,the Court of Appeals relied on two flawed premises: thatthe Limitation Act grants vessel owners a right to obtain531US2 Unit: $U24 [04-12-02 19:31:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN453Cite as: 531 U. S. 438 (2001)Opinion of the Courtexoneration from liability in federal court where limitation ofliability is not at issue, and that the saving to suitors clausereserves to claimants only the right to receive a jury trial.By its own terms, the Limitation Act protects the right ofvessel owners to limit their liability to the value of the ves-sel, provided that the events or circumstances giving rise tothe damage occurred without the vessel owner's privity orknowledge. The Act was designed to encourage investmentand protect vessel owners from unlimited exposure to liability. We have also made clear, however, that the scope ofexclusive federal jurisdiction is proportional to the federalinterest in protecting the vessel owner's right to seek limitation of liability. See Lake Tankers, 354 U. S., at 153. Wehave explained that "[t]he Act is not one of immunity fromliability but of limitation of it." Id., at 152. We see no reason to revisit that conclusion and decline respondent's invitation to expand the scope of the Act.In construing the Limitation Act, this Court long ago determined that vessel owners may contest liability in theprocess of seeking limited liability, and we promulgated rulesto that effect pursuant to our "power to regulate . . . proceedings." The "Benefactor," 103 U. S., at 244; SupplementaryRule of Practice in Admiralty 56, 13 Wall., at xiii; Supplemental Admiralty and Maritime Claims Rule F(2). Thus,we agree with respondent that a vessel owner need not confess liability in order to seek limitation under the Act. TheAct and the rules of practice, however, do not create a freestanding right to exoneration from liability in circumstanceswhere limitation of liability is not at issue. In this case,petitioner stipulated that his claim for damages would notexceed the value of the vessel and waived any claim of resjudicata from the state court action concerning issues bearing on the limitation of liability. The District Court concluded that these stipulations would protect the vessel owner's right to seek limited liability in federal court. Then, outof an "abundance of caution," the court stayed the limitation531US2 Unit: $U24 [04-12-02 19:31:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN454 LEWIS v. LEWIS & CLARK MARINE, INC.Opinion of the Courtproceedings so that it could act if the state court proceedingsjeopardized the vessel owner's rights under the LimitationAct. 31 F. Supp. 2d, at 1170-1171. We believe nothingmore was required to protect respondent's right to seek alimitation of liability.The district courts have jurisdiction over actions arisingunder the Limitation Act, and they have discretion to stayor dismiss Limitation Act proceedings to allow a suitor topursue his claims in state court. If the district court concludes that the vessel owner's right to limitation will not beadequately protected--where for example a group of claimants cannot agree on appropriate stipulations or there is uncertainty concerning the adequacy of the fund or the numberof claims--the court may proceed to adjudicate the merits,deciding the issues of liability and limitation. See, e. g.,Lake Tankers, supra, at 152; Port Arthur Towing Co. v. JohnW. Towing, Inc., 42 F. 3d 312, 314 (CA5 1995). But where,as here, the District Court satisfies itself that a vessel owner's right to seek limitation will be protected, the decision todissolve the injunction is well within the court's discretion.The Court of Appeals reasoned that the District Courtalso erred in dissolving the injunction because petitioner hadno saved remedy in state court. The Court of Appeals apparently treated as dispositive petitioner's failure to demanda jury trial in state court. The jurisdictional statute, however, reserves to suitors "all other remedies to which theyare otherwise entitled." 28 U. S. C. $ 1333(1). Tracing thedevelopment of the clause since the Judiciary Act of 1789, itappears that the clause was designed to protect remediesavailable at common law. See, e. g., The Hine v. Trevor, 4Wall. 555 (1867). We later explained that the clause extendsto "all means other than proceedings in admiralty which maybe employed to enforce the right or to redress the injuryinvolved." Red Cross Line, 264 U. S., at 124. Trial by juryis an obvious, but not exclusive, example of the remedies531US2 Unit: $U24 [04-12-02 19:31:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN455Cite as: 531 U. S. 438 (2001)Opinion of the Courtavailable to suitors. See Lake Tankers, supra, at 153; RedCross Line, supra, at 123-125.The Court of Appeals concluded that forum choice couldnot be a saved remedy under the saving to suitors clausebecause a claimant does not have the ability to control theforum in which his claim will be heard. 196 F. 3d, at 909.The prospect that a vessel owner may remove a state courtaction to federal court, however, does not limit a claimant'sforum choice under the saving to suitors clause any morethan other litigants' forum choices may be limited. We havepreviously refused to hold that admiralty claims, such as alimitation claim, fall within the scope of federal question jurisdiction out of concern that saving to suitors actions instate court would be removed to federal court and undermine the claimant's choice of forum. Romero v. International Terminal Operating Co., 358 U. S. 354, 371-372 (1959).We explained that to define admiralty jurisdiction as federalquestion jurisdiction would be a "destructive oversimplification of the highly intricate interplay of the States and theNational Government in their regulation of maritime commerce." Id., at 373. Moreover, in this case respondentraised a Jones Act claim, which is not subject to removal tofederal court even in the event of diversity of the parties.See 28 U. S. C. $ 1445(a) (incorporated by reference into theJones Act, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 688(a)). Respondent's arguments to limit and enumerate the saved remedies under thesaving to suitors clause must fail in view of the consistentrecognition by Congress and this Court that both state andfederal courts may be proper forums for adjudicating claimssuch as petitioner's.In sum, this Court's case law makes clear that state courts,with all of their remedies, may adjudicate claims like petitioner's against vessel owners so long as the vessel owner'sright to seek limitation of liability is protected. Respondentseeks to invert that rule, making run of the mill personal531US2 Unit: $U24 [04-12-02 19:31:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN456 LEWIS v.

We reject that proposal and hold that the Courtof Appeals erred in reversing the District Court's decisionto dissolve the injunction.The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals forthe Eighth Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is re-manded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
