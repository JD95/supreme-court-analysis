Petitioner, Kevin Wiggins, argues that his attorneys' fail-ure to investigate his background and present mitigating evidence of his unfortunate life history at his capital sentencingproceedings violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.In this case, we consider whether the United States Courtof Appeals for the Fourth Circuit erred in upholding theMaryland Court of Appeals' rejection of this claim.IAOn September 17, 1988, police discovered 77-year-old Flor-ence Lacs drowned in the bathtub of her ransacked apartment in Woodlawn, Maryland.

S. 510 (2003)Opinion of the CourtCircuit Court. Ibid. On August 4, after a 4-day trial, thecourt found petitioner guilty of first-degree murder, robbery,and two counts of theft. App. 32.After his conviction, Wiggins elected to be sentenced by ajury, and the trial court scheduled the proceedings to beginon October 11, 1989. On September 11, counsel filed a motion for bifurcation of sentencing in hopes of presenting Wiggins' case in two phases. Id., at 34. Counsel intended firstto prove that Wiggins did not act as a "principal in the firstdegree," ibid.--i. e., that he did not kill the victim by his ownhand. See Md. Ann. Code, Art. 27, $ 413 (1996) (requiringproof of direct responsibility for death eligibility). Counselthen intended, if necessary, to present a mitigation case. Inthe memorandum in support of their motion, counsel arguedthat bifurcation would enable them to present each case inits best light; separating the two cases would prevent theintroduction of mitigating evidence from diluting their claimthat Wiggins was not directly responsible for the murder.App. 36-42, 37.On October 12, the court denied the bifurcation motion,and sentencing proceedings commenced immediately thereafter. In her opening statement, Nethercott told the jurorsthey would hear evidence suggesting that someone otherthan Wiggins actually killed Lacs. Id., at 70-71. Counselthen explained that the judge would instruct them to weighWiggins' clean record as a factor against a death sentence.She concluded: " `You're going to hear that Kevin Wigginshas had a difficult life. It has not been easy for him. Buthe's worked. He's tried to be a productive citizen, and he'sreached the age of 27 with no convictions for prior crimes ofviolence and no convictions, period. . . . I think that's animportant thing for you to consider.' " Id., at 72. Duringthe proceedings themselves, however, counsel introduced noevidence of Wiggins' life history.Before closing arguments, Schlaich made a proffer to thecourt, outside the presence of the jury, to preserve bifurca539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN516 WIGGINS v. SMITHOpinion of the Courttion as an issue for appeal. He detailed the mitigation casecounsel would have presented had the court granted theirbifurcation motion. He explained that they would have in-troduced psychological reports and expert testimony demonstrating Wiggins' limited intellectual capacities and childlikeemotional state on the one hand, and the absence of aggressive patterns in his behavior, his capacity for empathy, andhis desire to function in the world on the other. Seeid., at349-351. At no point did Schlaich proffer any evidence ofpetitioner's life history or family background. On October18, the court instructed the jury on the sentencing task before it, and later that afternoon, the jury returned with asentence of death. Id., at 409-410. A divided MarylandCourt of Appeals affirmed. Wiggins v. State, 324 Md. 551,597 A. 2d 1359 (1991), cert. denied, 503 U. S. 1007 (1992).BIn 1993, Wiggins sought postconviction relief in BaltimoreCounty Circuit Court. With new counsel, he challenged theadequacy of his representation at sentencing, arguing thathis attorneys had rendered constitutionally defective assistance by failing to investigate and present mitigating evi-dence of his dysfunctional background. App. to Pet. forCert. 132a. To support his claim, petitioner presented testi-mony by Hans Selvog, a licensed social worker certified asan expert by the court. App. 419. Selvog testified con-cerning an elaborate social history report he had preparedcontaining evidence of the severe physical and sexual abusepetitioner suffered at the hands of his mother and while inthe care of a series of foster parents. Relying on state socialservices, medical, and school records, as well as interviewswith petitioner and numerous family members, Selvog chron-icled petitioner's bleak life history. App. to Pet. for Cert.163a.According to Selvog's report, petitioner's mother, a chronicalcoholic, frequently left Wiggins and his siblings home alone539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN517Cite as: 539 U. S. 510 (2003)Opinion of the Courtfor days, forcing them to beg for food and to eat paint chipsand garbage.Id., at 166a-167a. Mrs. Wiggins' abusive behavior included beating the children for breaking into thekitchen, which she often kept locked. She had sex with menwhile her children slept in the same bed and, on one occasion,forced petitioner's hand against a hot stove burner--an incident that led to petitioner's hospitalization. Id., at 167a-171a. At the age of six, the State placed Wiggins in fostercare. Petitioner's first and second foster mothers abusedhim physically, id., at 175a-176a, and, as petitioner explainedto Selvog, the father in his second foster home repeatedlymolested and raped him. Id., at 176a-179a. At age 16,petitioner ran away from his foster home and began livingon the streets. He returned intermittently to additional foster homes, including one in which the foster mother's sonsallegedly gang-raped him on more than one occasion. Id.,at 190a. After leaving the foster care system, Wigginsentered a Job Corps program and was allegedly sexuallyabused by his supervisor. Id., at 192a.During the postconviction proceedings, Schlaich testifiedthat he did not remember retaining a forensic social workerto prepare a social history, even though the State made fundsavailable for that purpose. App. 487-488. He explainedthat he and Nethercott, well in advance of trial, decided tofocus their efforts on " `retry[ing] the factual case' " and disputing Wiggins' direct responsibility for the murder. Id., at485-486. In April 1994, at the close of the proceedings, thejudge observed from the bench that he could not remembera capital case in which counsel had not compiled a social history of the defendant, explaining, " `[n]ot to do a social history, at least to see what you have got, to me is absoluteerror. I just--I would be flabbergasted if the Court of Appeals said anything else.' " Id., at 605. In October 1997,however, the trial court denied Wiggins' petition for postconviction relief. The court concluded that "when the decisionnot to investigate . . . is a matter of trial tactics, there is no539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN518 WIGGINS v. SMITHOpinion of the Courtineffective assistance of counsel." App. to Pet. for Cert.155a-156a.The Maryland Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of re-lief, concluding that trial counsel had made "a deliberate, tactical decision to concentrate their effort at convincing thejury" that appellant was not directly responsible for the murder. Wiggins v. State, 352 Md., at 608, 724 A. 2d, at 15.The court observed that counsel knew of Wiggins' unfortunate childhood. They had available to them both the pre-sentence investigation (PSI) report prepared by the Divisionof Parole and Probation, as required by Maryland law, Md.Ann. Code, Art. 41, $ 4-609(d) (1988), as well as "more detailed social service records that recorded incidences of phys-ical and sexual abuse, an alcoholic mother, placements in foster care, and borderline retardation." 352 Md., at 608-609,724 A. 2d, at 15. The court acknowledged that this evidencewas neither as detailed nor as graphic as the history elabo-rated in the Selvog report but emphasized that "counseldidinvestigate andwere aware of appellant's background." Id.,at 610, 724 A. 2d, at 16 (emphasis in original). Counsel knewthat at least one uncontested mitigating factor--Wiggins'lack of prior convictions--would be before the jury shouldtheir attempt to disprove Wiggins' direct responsibility forthe murder fail. As a result, the court concluded, Schlaichand Nethercott "made a reasoned choice to proceed withwhat they thought was their best defense." Id., at 611-612,724 A. 2d, at 17. CIn September 2001, Wiggins filed a petition for writ ofhabeas corpus in Federal District Court. The trial courtgranted him relief, holding that the Maryland courts' rejec-tion of his ineffective assistance claim "involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law." Wigginsv. Corcoran, 164 F. Supp. 2d 538, 557 (2001) (citing Williamsv. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362 (2000)). The court rejected theState's defense of counsel's "tactical" decision to " `retry539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN519Cite as: 539 U.

Supp. 2d, at 558. The court found that though counselwere aware of some aspects of Wiggins' background, thatknowledge did not excuse them from their duty to make a"fully informed and deliberate decision" about whether topresent a mitigation case. In fact, the court concluded, theirknowledge triggered an obligation to look further. Id., at559.Reviewing the District Court's decisi on de novo, theFourth Circuit reversed, holding that counsel had made areasonable strategic decision to focus on petitioner's directresponsibility. Wiggins v. Corcoran, 288 F. 3d 629, 639-640(2002). The court contrasted counsel's complete failure toinvestigate potential mitigating evidence in Williams, 288F. 3d, at 640, with the fact that Schlaich and Nethercott knewat least some details of Wiggins' childhood from the PSI andsocial services records, id., at 641. The court acknowledgedthat counsel likely knew further investigation "would haveresulted in more sordid details surfacing," but agreed withthe Maryland Court of Appeals that counsel's knowledge ofthe avenues of mitigation available to them "was sufficient tomake an informed strategic choice" to challenge petitioner'sdirect responsibility for the murder. Id., at 641-642. Thecourt emphasized that conflicting medical testimony with respect to the time of death, the absence of direct evidenceagainst Wiggins, and unexplained forensic evidence at thecrime scene supported counsel's strategy. Id., at 641.We granted certiorari, 537 U. S. 1027 (2002), and nowreverse.IIAPetitioner renews his contention that his attorneys' performance at sentencing violated his Sixth Amendment right539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN520 WIGGINS v. SMITHOpinion of the Courtto effective assistance of counsel. The amendments to 28U. S. C. $ 2254, enacted as part of the Antiterrorism andEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), circumscribeour consideration of Wiggins' claim and require us to limitour analysis to the law as it was "clearly established" by ourprecedents at the time of the state court's decision. Section2254 provides:"(d) An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalfof a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of aState court shall not be granted with respect to anyclaim that was adjudicated on the merits in State courtproceedings unless the adjudication of the claim--"(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Courtof the United States; or"(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding."We have made clear that the "unreasonable application"prong of $ 2254(d)(1) permits a federal habeas court to "grantthe writ if the state court identifies the correct governinglegal principle from this Court's decisions but unreasonablyapplies that principle to the facts" of petitioner's case. Williams v. Taylor, supra, at 413; see also Bell v. Cone, 535 U. S.685, 694 (2002). In other words, a federal court may grantrelief when a state court has misapplied a "governing legalprinciple" to "a set of facts different from those of the casein which the principle was announced." Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 76 (2003) (citing Williams v. Taylor,supra, at 407). In order for a federal court to find a statecourt's application of our precedent "unreasonable," the statecourt's decision must have been more than incorrect or erroneous. See Lockyer, supra, at 75. The state court's appli539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN521Cite as: 539 U. S. 510 (2003)Opinion of the Courtcation must have been "objectively unreasonable." See Wil-liams v. Taylor, 529 U. S., at 409.We established the legal principles that govern claims ofineffective assistance of counsel in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). An ineffective assistance claim hastwo components: A petitioner must show that counsel's performance was deficient, and that the deficiency prejudicedthe defense.Id., at 687. To establish deficient perform-ance, a petitioner must demonstrate that counsel's representation "fell below an objective standard of reasonableness."Id., at 688. We have declined to articulate specific guidelines for appropriate attorney conduct and instead have em-phasized that "[t]he proper measure of attorney performanceremains simply reasonableness under prevailing professionalnorms." Ibid.In this case, as in Strickland, petitioner's claim stems fromcounsel's decision to limit the scope of their investigationinto potential mitigating evidence. Id., at 673. Here, as inStrickland, counsel attempt to justify their limited investiga-tion as reflecting a tactical judgment not to present mitigating evidence at sentencing and to pursue an alternativestrategy instead. In rejecting the respondent's claim, wedefined the deference owed such strategic judgments interms of the adequacy of the investigations supportingthose judgments:"[S]trategic choices made after thorough investigationof law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made afterless than complete investigation are reasonable preciselyto the extent that reasonable professional judgmentssupport the limitations on investigation. In otherwords, counsel has a duty to make reasonable investiga-tions or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary. In any ineffectivenesscase, a particular decision not to investigate must bedirectly assessed for reasonableness in all the circum539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN522 WIGGINS v. SMITHOpinion of the Courtstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to coun-sel's judgments." Id., at 690-691.Our opinion in Williams v. Taylor is illustrative of theproper application of these standards. In finding Williams'ineffectiveness claim meritorious, we applied Strickland andconcluded that counsel's failure to uncover and present voluminous mitigating evidence at sentencing could not be justi-fied as a tactical decision to focus on Williams' voluntary confessions, because counsel had not "fulfill[ed] their obligationto conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant's background." 529 U. S., at 396 (citing 1 ABA Standards forCriminal Justice 4-4.1, commentary, p. 4-55 (2d ed. 1980)).While Williams had not yet been decided at the time theMaryland Court of Appeals rendered the decision at issue inthis case, cf. post, at 542 (Scalia, J., dissenting), Williams'case was before us on habeas review. Contrary to the dissent's contention, post, at 543, we therefore made no new lawin resolving Williams' ineffectiveness claim. SeeWilliams,529 U. S., at 390 (noting that the merits of Williams' claim"are squarely governed by our holding in Strickland"); seealso id., at 395 (noting that the trial court correctly appliedboth components of the Strickland standard to petitioner'sclaim and proceeding to discuss counsel's failure to investigate as a violation of Strickland's performance prong). Inhighlighting counsel's duty to investigate, and in referring tothe ABA Standards for Criminal Justice as guides, we ap-plied the same "clearly established" precedent ofStricklandwe apply today. Cf. 466 U. S., at 690-691 (establishing that"thorough investigation[s]" are "virtually unchallengeable"and underscoring that "counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations"); see also id., at 688-689 ("Prevailingnorms of practice as reflected in American Bar Associationstandards and the like . . . are guides to determining whatis reasonable").In light of these standards, our principal concern in decid-ing whether Schlaich and Nethercott exercised "reasonable539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN523Cite as: 539 U. S. 510 (2003)Opinion of the Courtprofessional judgmen[t]," id., at 691, is not whether counselshould have presented a mitigation case. Rather, we focuson whether the investigation supporting counsel's decisionnot to introduce mitigating evidence of Wiggins' backgroundwas i tsel f reasonable. Ibi d. Cf. Wi ll i ams v. Taylor,supra, at 415 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (noting counsel'sduty to conduct the "requisite, diligent" investigation intohis client's background). In assessing counsel's investigation, we must conduct an objective review of their performance, measured for "reasonableness under prevailing professional norms," Strickland, 466 U. S., at 688, which includesa context-dependent consideration of the challenged conductas seen "from counsel's perspective at the time," id., at 689("[E]very effort [must] be made to eliminate the distortingeffects of hindsight").B1The record demonstrates that counsel's investigation drewfrom three sources. App. 490-491. Counsel arranged forWilliam Stejskal, a psychologist, to conduct a number oftests on petitioner. Stejskal concluded that petitioner hadan IQ of 79, had difficulty coping with demanding situations,and exhibited features of a personality disorder. Id., at 44-45, 349-351. These reports revealed nothing, however, ofpetitioner's life history. Tr. of Oral Arg. 24-25.With respect to that history, counsel had available to themthe written PSI, which included a one-page account of Wiggins' "personal history" noting his "misery as a youth," quoting his description of his own background as " `disgusting,' "and observing that he spent most of his life in foster care.App. 20-21. Counsel also "tracked down" records kept bythe Baltimore City Department of Social Services (DSS) documenting petitioner's various placements in the State's foster care system. Id., at 490; Lodging of Petitioner. In describing the scope of counsel's investigation into petitioner's539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN524 WIGGINS v. SMITHOpinion of the Courtlife history, both the Fourth Circuit and the Maryland Courtof Appeals referred only to these two sources of information.See 288 F. 3d, at 640-641; Wiggins v. State, 352 Md., at 608-609, 724 A. 2d, at 15.Counsel's decision not to expand their investigation be-yond the PSI and the DSS records fell short of the professional standards that prevailed in Maryland in 1989. AsSchlaich acknowledged, standard practice in Maryland incapital cases at the time of Wiggins' trial included the preparation of a social history report. App. 488. Despite the factthat the Public Defender's office made funds available for theretention of a forensic social worker, counsel chose not tocommission such a report. Id., at 487. Counsel's conductsimilarly fell short of the standards for capital defense workarticulated by the American Bar Association (ABA)--standards to which we long have referred as "guides to determining what is reasonable." Strickland, supra, at 688;Williams v. Taylor, supra, at 396. The ABA Guidelinesprovide that investigations into mitigating evidence "shouldcomprise efforts to discover all reasonably available mitigating evidence and evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence that may be introduced by the prosecutor." ABAGuidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counselin Death Penalty Cases 11.4.1(C), p. 93 (1989) (emphasisadded). Despite these well-defined norms, however, counselabandoned their investigation of petitioner's backgroundafter having acquired only rudimentary knowledge of his history from a narrow set of sources. Cf. id., 11.8.6, p. 133 (noting that among the topics counsel should consider presentingare medical history, educational history, employment andtraining history, family and social history, prior adult andjuvenile correctional experience, and religious and culturalinfluences (emphasis added)); 1 ABA Standards for CriminalJustice 4-4.1, commentary, p. 4-55 (2d ed. 1982) ("The lawyeralso has a substantial and important role to perform in raising mitigating factors both to the prosecutor initially and539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN525Cite as: 539 U. S. 510 (2003)Opinion of the Courtto the court at sentencing. . . . Investigation is essential tofulfillment of these functions").The scope of their investigation was also unreasonable inlight of what counsel actually discovered in the DSS records.The records revealed several facts: Petitioner's mother wasa chronic alcoholic; Wiggins was shuttled from foster hometo foster home and displayed some emotional difficultieswhile there; he had frequent, lengthy absences from school;and, on at least one occasion, his mother left him and hissiblings alone for days without food. See Lodging of Peti-tioner 54-95, 126, 131-136, 140, 147, 159-176. As the Federal District Court emphasized, any reasonably competentattorney would have realized that pursuing these leads wasnecessary to making an informed choice among possible defenses, particularly given the apparent absence of any aggravating factors in petitioner's background. 164 F. Supp. 2d,at 559. Indeed, counsel uncovered no evidence in their investigation to suggest that a mitigation case, in its own right,would have been counterproductive, or that further investigation would have been fruitless; this case is therefore distinguishable from our precedents in which we have foundlimited investigations into mitigating evidence to be reasonable. See, e. g., Strickland, supra, at 699 (concluding thatcounsel could "reasonably surmise . . . that character andpsychological evidence would be of little help"); Burger v.Kemp, 483 U. S. 776, 794 (1987) (concluding counsel's limitedinvestigation was reasonable because he interviewed all witnesses brought to his attention, discovering little that washelpful and much that was harmful); Darden v. Wainwright,477 U. S. 168, 186 (1986) (concluding that counsel engagedin extensive preparation and that the decision to present amitigation case would have resulted in the jury hearing evidence that petitioner had been convicted of violent crimesand spent much of his life in jail). Had counsel investigatedfurther, they might well have discovered the sexual abuselater revealed during state postconviction proceedings.539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN526 WIGGINS v. SMITHOpinion of the CourtThe record of the actual sentencing proceedings under-scores the unreasonableness of counsel's conduct by suggesting that their failure to investigate thoroughly resulted frominattention, not reasoned strategic judgment. Counselsought, until the day before sentencing, to have the proceed-ings bifurcated into a retrial of guilt and a mitigation stage.See supra, at 515. On the eve of sentencing, counsel represented to the court that they were prepared to come forwardwith mitigating evidence, App. 45, and that they intended topresent such evidence in the event the court granted theirmotion to bifurcate. In other words, prior to sentencing,counsel never actually abandoned the possibility that theywould present a mitigation defense. Until the court deniedtheir motion, then, they had every reason to develop themost powerful mitigation case possible.What is more, during the sentencing proceeding itself,counsel did not focus exclusively on Wiggins' direct responsibility for the murder. After introducing that issue in heropening statement, id., at 70-71, Nethercott entreated thejury to consider not just what Wiggins "is found to havedone," but also "who [he] is." Id., at 70. Though she toldthe jury it would "hear that Kevin Wiggins has had a difficultlife," id., at 72, counsel never followed up on that suggestionwith details of Wiggins' history. At the same time, counselcalled a criminologist to testify that inmates serving life sentences tend to adjust well and refrain from further violencein prison--testimony with no bearing on whether petitionercommitted the murder by his own hand. Id., at 311-312.Far from focusing exclusively on petitioner's direct responsibility, then, counsel put on a halfhearted mitigation case, taking precisely the type of " `shotgun' " approach the MarylandCourt of Appeals concluded counsel sought to avoid. Wiggins v. State, 352 Md., at 609, 724 A. 2d, at 15. When viewedin this light, the "strategic decision" the state courts andrespondents all invoke to justify counsel's limited pursuit ofmitigating evidence resembles more a post hoc rationaliza539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN527Cite as: 539 U. S. 510 (2003)Opinion of the Courttion of counsel's conduct than an accurate description of theirdeliberations prior to sentencing.In rejecting petitioner's ineffective assistance claim, theMaryland Court of Appeals appears to have assumed thatbecause counsel had some information with respect to peti-tioner's background--the information in the PSI and theDSS records--they were in a position to make a tacticalchoice not to present a mitigation defense. Id., at 611-612,724 A. 2d, at 17 (citing federal and state precedents findingineffective assistance in cases in which counsel failed to con-duct an investigation of any kind). In assessing the reasonableness of an attorney's investigation, however, a courtmust consider not only the quantum of evidence alreadyknown to counsel, but also whether the known evidencewould lead a reasonable attorney to investigate further.Even assuming Schlaich and Nethercott limited the scopeof their investigation for strategic reasons, Strickland doesnot establish that a cursory investigation automatically justifies a tactical decision with respect to sentencing strategy.Rather, a reviewing court must consider the reasonablenessof the investigation said to support that strategy. 466U. S., at 691.The Maryland Court of Appeals' application of Strickland's governing legal principles was objectively unreasonable. Though the state court acknowledged petitioner'sclaim that counsel's failure to prepare a social history "didnot meet the minimum standards of the profession," thecourt did not conduct an assessment of whether the decisionto cease all investigation upon obtaining the PSI and theDSS records actually demonstrated reasonable professionaljudgment. Wiggins v. State, 352 Md., at 609, 724 A. 2d,at 16. The state court merely assumed that the investigation was adequate. In light of what the PSI and the DSSrecords actually revealed, however, counsel chose to abandontheir investigation at an unreasonable juncture, making afully informed decision with respect to sentencing strategy539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN528 WIGGINS v. SMITHOpinion of the Courtimpossible. The Court of Appeals' assumption that the in-vestigation was adequate,ibid., thus reflected an unreasonable application of Strickland. 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1). Asa result, the court's subsequent deference to counsel's strategic decision not "to present every conceivable mitigation de-fense," 352 Md., at 610, 724 A. 2d, at 16, despite the fact thatcounsel based this alleged choice on what we have made clearwas an unreasonable investigation, was also objectively un-reasonable. As we established inStrickland, "strategicchoices made after less than complete investigation are rea-sonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professionaljudgments support the limitations on investigation." 466U. S., at 690-691.Additionally, the court based its conclusion, in part, on aclear factual error--that the "social service records . . . recorded incidences of . . . sexual abuse." 352 Md., at 608-609,724 A. 2d, at 15. As the State and the United States nowconcede, the records contain no mention of sexual abuse,much less of the repeated molestations and rapes of petitioner detailed in the Selvog report. Brief for Respondents22; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26; App. toPet. for Cert. 175a-179a, 190a. The state court's assumptionthat the records documented instances of this abuse has beenshown to be incorrect by "clear and convincing evidence," 28U. S. C. $ 2254(e)(1), and reflects "an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in theState court proceeding," $ 2254(d)(2). This partial relianceon an erroneous factual finding further highlights the unreasonableness of the state court's decision.The dissent insists that this Court's hands are tied, under$ 2254(d), "by the state court's factual determinations thatWiggins' trial counsel `did investigate and were awareof [Wiggins'] background,' " post, at 550. But as we havemade clear, the Maryland Court of Appeals' conclusion thatthe scope of counsel's investigation into petitioner's background met the legal standards set in Strickland repre539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN529Cite as: 539 U. S. 510 (2003)Opinion of the Courtsented an objectively unreasonable application of our precedent. $ 2254(d)(1). Moreover, the court's assumption thatcounsel learned of a major aspect of Wiggins' background,i. e., the sexual abuse, from the DSS records was clearlyerroneous. The requirements of $ 2254(d) thus pose no barto granting petitioner habeas relief.2In their briefs to this Court, the State and the UnitedStates contend that counsel, in fact, conducted a more thorough investigation than the one we have just described.This conclusion, they explain, follows from Schlaich's postconviction testimony that he knew of the sexual abuse Wiggins suffered, as well as of the hand-burning incident. According to the State and its amicus, the fact that counselclaimed to be aware of this evidence, which was not in thesocial services records, coupled with Schlaich's statementthat he knew what was in "other people's reports," App. 490-491, suggests that counsel's investigation must have extended beyond the social services records. Tr. of Oral Arg.31-36; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26-27, n. 4;Brief for Respondents 35. Schlaich simply "was not askedto and did not reveal the source of his knowledge" of theabuse. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 27, n. 4.In considering this reading of the state postconviction record, we note preliminarily that the Maryland Court of Appeals clearly assumed both that counsel's investigation beganand ended with the PSI and the DSS records and that thisinvestigation was sufficient in scope to satisfy Strickland'sreasonableness requirement. See Wiggins v. State, 352 Md.,at 608, 724 A. 2d, at 15. The court also assumed, erroneously, that the social services records cited incidences of sexual abuse. See id., at 608-609, 724 A. 2d, at 15. Respondents' interpretation of Schlaich's postconviction testimonytherefore has no bearing on whether the Maryland Court of539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN530 WIGGINS v. SMITHOpinion of the CourtAppeals' decision reflected an objectively unreasonable appli-cation ofStrickland.In its assessment of the Maryland Court of Appeals' opin-ion, the dissent apparently does not dispute that if counsel'sinvestigation in this case had consisted exclusively of the PSIand the DSS records, the court's decision would have constituted an unreasonable application of Strickland. See post,at 543-544. Of necessity, then, the dissent's primary conten-tion is that the Maryland Court of Appealsdid decide thatWiggins' counsel looked beyond the PSI and the DSS recordsand that we must therefore defer to that finding under$ 2254(e)(1). See post, at 544-551. Had the court foundthat counsel's investigation extended beyond the PSI and theDSS records, the dissent, of course, would be correct that$ 2254(e) would require that we defer to that finding. Butthe state court made no such finding.The dissent bases its conclusion on the Maryland Court ofAppeals' statements that " `[c]ounsel were aware that appellant had a most unfortunate childhood,' " and that " `counseldid investigate and were aware of appellant's background.' "See post, at 540, 545 (quoting Wiggins v. State, supra, at 608,610, 724 A. 2d, at 15, 16). But the state court's descriptionof how counsel learned of petitioner's childhood speaks foritself. The court explained: "Counsel were aware that appellant had a most unfortunate childhood. Mr. Schlaich hadavailable to him not only the pre-sentence investigation report . . . but also more detailed social service records." See352 Md., at 608-609, 724 A. 2d, at 15. This construction reflects the state court's understanding that the investigationconsisted of the two sources the court mentions. Indeed,when describing counsel's investigation into petitioner'sbackground, the court never so much as implies that counseluncovered any source other than the PSI and the DSS records. The court's conclusion that counsel were aware of "incidences of . . . sexual abuse" does not suggest otherwise,cf. supra, at 518, because the court assumed that counsel539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN531Cite as: 539 U. S. 510 (2003)Opinion of the Courtlearned of such incidents from the social services records.Wiggins v. State, 352 Md., at 608-609, 724 A. 2d, at 15.The court's subsequent statement that, "as noted, counseldid investigate and were aware of appellant's background,"underscores our conclusion that the Maryland Court of Appeals assumed counsel's investigation into Wiggins' childhood consisted of the PSI and the DSS records. The court'suse of the phrase "as noted," which the dissent ignores,further confirms that counsel's investigation consisted of thesources previously described, i. e., the PSI and the DSSrecords. It is the dissent, therefore, that "rests upon a fundamental fallacy," post, at 544--that the Maryland Court ofAppeals determined that Schlaich's investigation extendedbeyond the PSI and the DSS records.We therefore must determine, de novo, whether counselreached beyond the PSI and the DSS records in their investigation of petitioner's background. The record as a wholedoes not support the conclusion that counsel conducted amore thorough investigation than the one we have described.The dissent, like the State and the United States, relies primarily on Schlaich's postconviction testimony to establishthat counsel investigated more extensively. But the questions put to Schlaich during his postconviction testimony allreferred to what he knew from the social services records;the line of questioning, after all, first directed him to hisdiscovery of those documents. His subsequent reference to"other people's reports," made in direct response to a question concerning petitioner's mental retardation, appears tobe an acknowledgment of the psychologist's reports we knowcounsel commissioned--reports that also revealed nothing ofthe sexual abuse Wiggins experienced. App. 349. As thestate trial judge who heard this testimony concluded at theclose of the proceedings, there is "no reason to believe that[counsel] did have all of this information." Id., at 606 (emphasis added).539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN532 WIGGINS v. SMITHOpinion of the CourtThe State maintained at oral argument that Schlaich's ref-erence to "other people's reports" indicated that counsellearned of the sexual abuse from sources other than the PSIand the DSS records. Tr. of Oral Arg. 31, 33, 35. But whenpressed repeatedly to identify the sources counsel mighthave consulted, the State acknowledged that no written reports documented the sexual abuse and speculated that counsel must have learned of it through "[o]ral reports" fromWiggins himself.Id., at 36. Not only would the phrase"other people's reports" have been an unusual way for coun-sel to refer to conversations with his client, but the recordcontains no evidence that counsel ever pursued this line ofquestioning with Wiggins. See id., at 24-25. For its part,the United States emphasized counsel's retention of the psychologist. Id., at 51; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 27. But again, counsel's decision to hire a psychologistsheds no light on the extent of their investigation into petitioner's social background. Though Stejskal based his conclusions on clinical interviews with Wiggins, as well as meetings with Wiggins' family members, Lodging of Petitioner,his final report discussed only petitioner's mental capacitiesand attributed nothing of what he learned to Wiggins' social history.To further underscore that counsel did not know, prior tosentencing, of the sexual abuse, as well as of the other incidents not recorded in the DSS records, petitioner directsus to the content of counsel's October 17, 1989, proffer. Before closing statements and outside the presence of the jury,Schlaich proffered to the court the mitigation case counselwould have introduced had the court granted their motion tobifurcate. App. 349-351. In his statement, Schlaich referred only to the results of the psychologist's test and mentioned nothing of Wiggins' troubled background. Given thatthe purpose of the proffer was to preserve their pursuit ofbifurcation as an issue for appeal, they had every incentiveto make their mitigation case seem as strong as possible.539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN533Cite as: 539 U. S. 510 (2003)Opinion of the CourtCounsel's failure to include in the proffer the powerful evi-dence of repeated sexual abuse is therefore explicable onlyif we assume that counsel had no knowledge of the abuse.Contrary to the dissent's claim, see post, at 547, we are notaccusing Schlaich of lying. His statements at the postcon-viction proceedings that he knew of this abuse, as well asof the hand-burning incident, may simply reflect a mistakenmemory shaped by the passage of time. After all, the statepostconviction proceedings took place over four years afterWiggins' sentencing. Ultimately, given counsel's likely ignorance of the history of sexual abuse at the time of sentenc-ing, we cannot infer from Schlaich's postconviction testimonythat counsel looked further than the PSI and the DSS rec-ords in investigating petitioner's background. Indeed, therecord contains no mention of sources other than those it isundisputed counsel possessed, seesupra, at 523-524. Wetherefore conclude that counsel's investigation of petitioner'sbackground was limited to the PSI and the DSS records.3In finding that Schlaich and Nethercott's investigation didnot meetStrickland's performance standards, we emphasizethat Strickland does not require counsel to investigate everyconceivable line of mitigating evidence no matter how un-likely the effort would be to assist the defendant at sentencing. Nor does Strickland require defense counsel to pre-sent mitigating evidence at sentencing in every case. Bothconclusions would interfere with the "constitutionally pro-tected independence of counsel" at the heart ofStrickland.466 U. S., at 689. We base our conclusion on the much morelimited principle that "strategic choices made after less thancomplete investigation are reasonable" only to the extentthat "reasonable professional judgments support the limita-tions on investigation." Id., at 690-691. A decision not toinvestigate thus "must be directly assessed for reasonable-ness in all the circumstances."Id., at 691.539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN534 WIGGINS v. SMITHOpinion of the CourtCounsel's investigation into Wiggins' background did notreflect reasonable professional judgment. Their decision toend their investigation when they did was neither consistentwith the professional standards that prevailed in 1989, norreasonable in light of the evidence counsel uncovered in thesocial services records--evidence that would have led a reasonably competent attorney to investigate further. Coun-sel's pursuit of bifurcation until the eve of sentencing andtheir partial presentation of a mitigation case suggest thattheir incomplete investigation was the result of inattention,not reasoned strategic judgment. In deferring to counsel'sdecision not to pursue a mitigation case despite their unreasonable investigation, the Maryland Court of Appealsunreasonably appliedStrickland. Furthermore, the courtpartially relied on an erroneous factual assumption. Therequirements for habeas relief established by 28 U. S. C.$ 2254(d) are thus satisfied.IIIIn order for counsel's inadequate performance to consti-tute a Sixth Amendment violation, petitioner must show thatcounsel's failures prejudiced his defense. Strickland, 466U. S., at 692. In Strickland, we made clear that, to establishprejudice, a "defendant must show that there is a reasonableprobability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, theresult of the proceeding would have been different. A rea-sonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermineconfidence in the outcome." Id., at 694. In assessing pre-judice, we reweigh the evidence in aggravation against thetotality of available mitigating evidence. In this case, ourreview is not circumscribed by a state court conclusion withrespect to prejudice, as neither of the state courts belowreached this prong of theStrickland analysis.The mitigating evidence counsel failed to discover andpresent in this case is powerful. As Selvog reported basedon his conversations with Wiggins and members of his fam539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN535Cite as: 539 U. S. 510 (2003)Opinion of the Courtily, see Reply Brief for Petitioner 18-19, Wiggins experienced severe privation and abuse in the first six years of hislife while in the custody of his alcoholic, absentee mother.He suffered physical torment, sexual molestation, and repeated rape during his subsequent years in foster care. Thetime Wiggins spent homeless, along with his diminishedmental capacities, further augment his mitigation case. Petitioner thus has the kind of troubled history we have declared relevant to assessing a defendant's moral culpability.Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 319 (1989) (" `[E]videnceabout the defendant's background and character is relevantbecause of the belief, long held by this society, that defendants who commit criminal acts that are attributable to a disadvantaged background . . . may be less culpable than defendants who have no such excuse' "); see also Eddings v.Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 112 (1982) (noting that consideration of the offender's life history is a " `part of the processof inflicting the penalty of death' "); Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S.586, 604 (1978) (invalidating Ohio law that did not permitconsideration of aspects of a defendant's background).Given both the nature and the extent of the abuse petitioner suffered, we find there to be a reasonable probabilitythat a competent attorney, aware of this history, would haveintroduced it at sentencing in an admissible form. While itmay well have been strategically defensible upon a reasonably thorough investigation to focus on Wiggins' direct responsibility for the murder, the two sentencing strategiesare not necessarily mutually exclusive. Moreover, given thestrength of the available evidence, a reasonable attorneymight well have chosen to prioritize the mitigation caseover the direct responsibility challenge, particularly giventhat Wiggins' history contained little of the double edge wehave found to justify limited investigations in other cases.Cf. Burger v. Kemp, 483 U. S. 776 (1987); Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 168 (1986).539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN536 WIGGINS v. SMITHOpinion of the CourtThe dissent nevertheless maintains that Wiggins' counselwould not have altered their chosen strategy of focusing exclusively on Wiggins' direct responsibility for the murder.Seepost, at 553-554. But as we have made clear, counselwere not in a position to make a reasonable strategic choiceas to whether to focus on Wiggins' direct responsibility, thesordid details of his life history, or both, because the investigation supporting their choice was unreasonable. Seesupra, at 524-527. Moreover, as we have noted, see supra,at 526, Wiggins' counsel did not focus solely on Wiggins'direct responsibility. Counsel told the sentencing jury"[y]ou're going to hear that Kevin Wiggins has had a difficultlife," App. 72, but never followed up on this suggestion.We further find that had the jury been confronted withthis considerable mitigating evidence, there is a reasonableprobability that it would have returned with a different sentence. In reaching this conclusion, we need not, as the dissent suggests, post, at 554-556, make the state-law evidentiary findings that would have been at issue at sentencing.Rather, we evaluate the totality of the evidence--"both thatadduced at trial, and the evidence adduced in the habeasproceeding[s]." Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S., at 397-398(emphasis added).In any event, contrary to the dissent's assertion, it appearsthat Selvog's report may have been admissible under Maryland law. In Whittlesey v. State, 340 Md. 30, 665 A. 2d 223(1995), the Maryland Court of Appeals vacated a trial courtdecision excluding, on hearsay grounds, testimony by Selvoghimself. The court instructed the trial judge to exercise itsdiscretion to admit "any relevant and reliable mitigating evidence, including hearsay evidence that might not be admissible in the guilt-or-innocence phase of the trial." Id., at 73,665 A. 2d, at 244. This "relaxed standard," the court observed, would provide the factfinder with "the opportunityto consider `any aspect of a defendant's character or record. . . that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN537Cite as: 539 U. S. 510 (2003)Opinion of the Courtthan death.' " Ibid. See also Ball v. State, 347 Md. 156,172-173, 699 A. 2d 1170, 1177 (1997) (noting that the trialjudge had admitted Selvog's social history report on the de-fendant). While the dissent dismisses the contents of thesocial history report, calling Wiggins a "liar" and his claimsof sexual abuse "uncorroborated gossip,"post, at 554, 555,Maryland appears to consider this type of evidence relevantat sentencing, see Whittlesey, supra, at 71, 665 A. 2d, at 243("The reasons for relaxing the rules of evidence apply withparticular force in the death penalty context"). Not eventhe State contests that Wiggins suffered from the varioustypes of abuse and neglect detailed in the PSI, the DSS records, and Selvog's social history report.Wiggins' sentencing jury heard only one significant mitigating factor--that Wiggins had no prior convictions. Hadthe jury been able to place petitioner's excruciating life history on the mitigating side of the scale, there is a reasonableprobability that at least one juror would have struck a different balance. Cf. Borchardt v. State, 367 Md. 91, 139-140,786 A. 2d 631, 660 (2001) (noting that as long as a single jurorconcludes that mitigating evidence outweighs aggravatingevidence, the death penalty cannot be imposed); App. 369(instructing the jury: "If you unanimously find that the Statehas proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the aggravating circumstance does outweigh the mitigating circumstances, then consider whether death is the appropriatesentence").Moreover, in contrast to the petitioner in Williams v. Taylor, supra, Wiggins does not have a record of violent conductthat could have been introduced by the State to offset thispowerful mitigating narrative. Cf. id., at 418 (Rehnquist,C. J., dissenting) (noting that Williams had savagely beatenan elderly woman, stolen two cars, set fire to a home, stabbeda man during a robbery, and confessed to choking two inmates and breaking a fellow prisoner's jaw). As the FederalDistrict Court found, the mitigating evidence in this case is539US2 Unit: $U81 [05-04-05 06:37:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN538 WIGGINS v. SMITHScalia, J., dissentingstronger, and the State's evidence in support of the deathpenalty far weaker, than in Williams, where we found prejudice as the result of counsel's failure to investigate and pre-sent mitigating evidence. Id., at 399. We thus concludethat the available mitigating evidence, taken as a whole,"might well have influenced the jury's appraisal" of Wiggins'moral culpability. Id., at 398. Accordingly, the judgmentof the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuitis reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.
