Under $ 1 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended,15 U. S. C. $ 1, "[e]very contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy, in restraint of trade" is illegal. In Albrecht v. HeraldCo., 390 U. S. 145 (1968), this Court held that vertical maximum price fixing is a per se violation of that statute. Inthis case, we are asked to reconsider that decision in lightof subsequent decisions of this Court. We conclude thatAlbrecht should be overruled.IRespondents, Barkat U.

The agreement provided that respondentswould obtain the station's gasoline supply from State Oil ata price equal to a suggested retail price set by State Oil, lessa margin of 3.25 cents per gallon. Under the agreement,respondents could charge any amount for gasoline sold to thestation's customers, but if the price charged was higher thanState Oil's suggested retail price, the excess was to be rebated to State Oil. Respondents could sell gasoline for lessthan State Oil's suggested retail price, but any such decreasewould reduce their 3.25 cents-per-gallon margin.About a year after respondents began operating the gasstation, they fell behind in lease payments. State Oil thengave notice of its intent to terminate the agreement and commenced a state court proceeding to evict respondents. AtState Oil's request, the state court appointed a receiver tooperate the gas station. The receiver operated the stationfor several months without being subject to the price restraints in respondents' agreement with State Oil. According to respondents, the receiver obtained an overall profitmargin in excess of 3.25 cents per gallon by lowering theprice of regular-grade gasoline and raising the price of premium grades.Respondents sued State Oil in the United States DistrictCourt for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging in partthat State Oil had engaged in price fixing in violation of $ 1of the Sherman Act by preventing respondents from raisingor lowering retail gas prices. According to the complaint,but for the agreement with State Oil, respondents could havecharged different prices based on the grades of gasoline, inthe same way that the receiver had, thereby achievingincreased sales and profits. State Oil responded that theagreement did not actually prevent respondents from settinggasoline prices, and that, in substance, respondents did notallege a violation of antitrust laws by their claim that StateOil's suggested retail price was not optimal.522US1 Unit: $$U2 [01-27-00 18:52:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN9Cite as: 522 U. S. 3 (1997)Opinion of the CourtThe District Court found that the allegations in the complaint did not state a per se violation of the Sherman Actbecause they did not establish the sort of "manifestly anticompetitive implications or pernicious effect on competition"that would justify per se prohibition of State Oil's conduct.App. 43-44. Subsequently, in ruling on cross-motions forsummary judgment, the District Court concluded that respondents had failed to demonstrate antitrust injury or harmto competition. App. to Pet. for Cert. 37a. The DistrictCourt held that respondents had not shown that a differencein gasoline pricing would have increased the station's sales;nor had they shown that State Oil had market power or thatits pricing provisions affected competition in a relevant market. Id., at 37a, 40a. Accordingly, the District Court entered summary judgment for State Oil on respondents' Sherman Act claim. Id., at 40a.The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed.93 F. 3d 1358 (1996). The court first noted that the agreement between respondents and State Oil did indeed fix maximum gasoline prices by making it "worthless" for respondents to exceed the suggested retail prices. Id., at 1360.After reviewing legal and economic aspects of price fixing,the court concluded that State Oil's pricing scheme was a perse antitrust violation under Albrecht v. Herald Co., supra.Although the Court of Appeals characterized Albrecht as"unsound when decided" and "inconsistent with later decisions" of this Court, it felt constrained to follow that decision.93 F. 3d, at 1363. In light of Albrecht and Atlantic RichfieldCo. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U. S. 328 (1990) (ARCO), thecourt found that respondents could have suffered antitrustinjury from not being able to adjust gasoline prices.We granted certiorari to consider two questions, whetherState Oil's conduct constitutes a per se violation of the Sherman Act and whether respondents are entitled to recoverdamages based on that conduct. 519 U. S. 1107 (1997).522US1 Unit: $$U2 [01-27-00 18:52:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN10 STATE OIL CO. v. KHANOpinion of the CourtIIAAlthough the Sherman Act, by its terms, prohibits everyagreement "in restraint of trade," this Court has long recognized that Congress intended to outlaw only unreasonablerestraints. See, e. g., Arizona v. Maricopa County MedicalSoc., 457 U. S. 332, 342-343 (1982) (citing United States v.Joint Traffic Assn., 171 U. S. 505 (1898)). As a consequence,most antitrust claims are analyzed under a "rule of reason,"according to which the finder of fact must decide whetherthe questioned practice imposes an unreasonable restraint oncompetition, taking into account a variety of factors, including specific information about the relevant business, its condition before and after the restraint was imposed, and therestraint's history, nature, and effect. 457 U. S., at 343, andn. 13 (citing Board of Trade of Chicago v. United States, 246U. S. 231, 238 (1918)).Some types of restraints, however, have such predictableand pernicious anticompetitive effect, and such limited potential for procompetitive benefit, that they are deemed unlawful per se. Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356U. S. 1, 5 (1958). Per se treatment is appropriate "[o]nce experience with a particular kind of restraint enables the Courtto predict with confidence that the rule of reason will condemn it." Maricopa County, supra, at 344; see also Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441U. S. 1, 19, n. 33 (1979). Thus, we have expressed reluctanceto adopt per se rules with regard to "restraints imposed inthe context of business relationships where the economic impact of certain practices is not immediately obvious." FTCv. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476 U. S. 447, 458-459(1986).A review of this Court's decisions leading up to and beyondAlbrecht is relevant to our assessment of the continuing validity of the per se rule established in Albrecht. Beginning522US1 Unit: $$U2 [01-27-00 18:52:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN11Cite as: 522 U. S. 3 (1997)Opinion of the Courtwith Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co.,220 U. S. 373 (1911), the Court recognized the illegality ofagreements under which manufacturers or suppliers set theminimum resale prices to be charged by their distributors.By 1940, the Court broadly declared all business combinations "formed for the purpose and with the effect of raising,depressing, fixing, pegging, or stabilizing the price of a commodity in interstate or foreign commerce" illegal per se.United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U. S. 150, 223(1940). Accordingly, the Court condemned an agreementbetween two affiliated liquor distillers to limit the maximumprice charged by retailers in Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. JosephE. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U. S. 211 (1951), noting thatagreements to fix maximum prices, "no less than those to fixminimum prices, cripple the freedom of traders and therebyrestrain their ability to sell in accordance with their ownjudgment." Id., at 213.In subsequent cases, the Court's attention turned to arrangements through which suppliers imposed restrictions ondealers with respect to matters other than resale price. InWhite Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U. S. 253 (1963), theCourt considered the validity of a manufacturer's assignmentof exclusive territories to its distributors and dealers. TheCourt determined that too little was known about the competitive impact of such vertical limitations to warrant treating them as per se unlawful. Id., at 263. Four years later,in United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U. S. 365(1967), the Court reconsidered the status of exclusive dealerterritories and held that, upon the transfer of title to goodsto a distributor, a supplier's imposition of territorial restrictions on the distributor was "so obviously destructive ofcompetition" as to constitute a per se violation of the Sherman Act. Id., at 379. In Schwinn, the Court acknowledgedthat some vertical restrictions, such as the conferral of territorial rights or franchises, could have procompetitive benefits by allowing smaller enterprises to compete, and that522US1 Unit: $$U2 [01-27-00 18:52:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN12 STATE OIL CO. v. KHANOpinion of the Courtsuch restrictions might avert vertical integration in the dis-tribution process.Id., at 379-380. The Court drew theline, however, at permitting manufacturers to control prod-uct marketing once dominion over the goods had passed todealers. Id., at 380.Albrecht, decided the following Term, involved a newspa-per publisher who had granted exclusive territories to independent carriers subject to their adherence to a maximumprice on resale of the newspapers to the public. Influencedby its decisions in Socony-Vacuum, Kiefer-Stewart, andSchwinn, the Court concluded that it was per se unlawful forthe publisher to fix the maximum resale price of its newspapers. 390 U. S., at 152-154. The Court acknowledgedthat "[m]aximum and minimum price fixing may have different consequences in many situations," but nonethelesscondemned maximum price fixing for "substituting the perhaps erroneous judgment of a seller for the forces of thecompetitive market." Id., at 152.Albrecht was animated in part by the fear that verticalmaximum price fixing could allow suppliers to discriminateagainst certain dealers, restrict the services that dealerscould afford to offer customers, or disguise minimum pricefixing schemes. Id., at 152-153. The Court rejected thenotion (both on the record of that case and in the abstract)that, because the newspaper publisher "granted exclusiveterritories, a price ceiling was necessary to protect the publicfrom price gouging by dealers who had monopoly power intheir own territories." Id., at 153.In a vigorous dissent, Justice Harlan asserted that the majority had erred in equating the effects of maximum and minimum price fixing. Id., at 156-168. Justice Harlan pointedout that, because the majority was establishing a per se rule,the proper inquiry was "not whether dictation of maximumprices is ever illegal, but whether it is always illegal." Id.,at 165-166. He also faulted the majority for conclusivelylisting "certain unfortunate consequences that maximum522US1 Unit: $$U2 [01-27-00 18:52:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN13Cite as: 522 U. S. 3 (1997)Opinion of the Courtprice dictation might have in other cases," even as it rejectedevidence that the publisher's practice of fixing maximumprices counteracted potentially anticompetitive actions by itsdistributors.Id., at 165. Justice Stewart also dissented,asserting that the publisher's maximum price fixing schemeshould be properly viewed as promoting competition, be-cause it protected consumers from dealers such as Albrecht,who, as "the only person who could sell for home deliverythe city's only daily morning newspaper," was "a monopolistwithin his own territory." Id., at 168.Nine years later, inContinental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36 (1977), the Court overruled Schwinn,thereby rejecting application of aper se rule in the contextof vertical nonprice restrictions. The Court acknowledgedthe principle of stare decisis, but explained that the need forclarification in the law justified reconsideration ofSchwinn:"Since its announcement, Schwinn has been the subjectof continuing controversy and confusion, both in thescholarly journals and in the federal courts. The greatweight of scholarly opinion has been critical of the decision, and a number of the federal courts confronted withanalogous vertical restrictions have sought to limit itsreach. In our view, the experience of the past 10 yearsshould be brought to bear on this subject of considerablecommercial importance." 433 U. S., at 47-49 (footnotesomitted).The Court considered the historical context of Schwinn,noting thatSchwinn's per se rule against vertical nonpricerestrictions came only four years after the Court had refusedto endorse a similar rule in White Motor Co., and that thedecision neither explained the "sudden change in position,"nor referred to the accepted requirements for per se violations set forth in Northern Pacific R. Co. 433 U. S., at 51-52. The Court then reviewed scholarly works supportingthe economic utility of vertical nonprice restraints. See id.,522US1 Unit: $$U2 [01-27-00 18:52:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN14 STATE OIL CO. v. KHANOpinion of the Courtat 54-57 (citing, e. g., Posner, Antitrust Policy and the Su-preme Court: An Analysis of the Restricted Distribution,Horizontal Merger and Potential Competition Decisions, 75Colum. L. Rev. 282 (1975); Preston, Restrictive DistributionArrangements: Economic Analysis and Public Policy Standards, 30 Law & Contemp. Prob. 506 (1965)). The Courtconcluded that, because "departure from the rule-of-reasonstandard must be based upon demonstrable economic effectrather than--as inSchwinn--upon formalistic line drawing,"the appropriate course would be "to return to the rule ofreason that governed vertical restrictions prior toSchwinn."GTE Sylvania, supra, at 58-59.In GTE Sylvania, the Court declined to comment on Albrecht's per se treatment of vertical maximum price restrictions, noting that the issue "involve[d] significantly differentquestions of analysis and policy." 433 U. S., at 51, n. 18.Subsequent decisions of the Court, however, have hintedthat the analytical underpinnings of Albrecht were substantially weakened by GTE Sylvania. We noted in Maricopa County that vertical restraints are generally moredefensible than horizontal restraints. See 457 U. S., at 348,n. 18. And we explained in 324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy, 479U. S. 335, 341-342 (1987), that decisions such as GTE Sylvania "recognize the possibility that a vertical restraintimposed by a single manufacturer or wholesaler may stimulate interbrand competition even as it reduces intrabrandcompetition."Most recently, in ARCO, 495 U. S. 328 (1990), although Albrecht's continuing validity was not squarely before theCourt, some disfavor with that decision was signaled by ourstatement that we would "assume, arguendo, that Albrechtcorrectly held that vertical, maximum price fixing is subjectto the per se rule." 495 U. S., at 335, n. 5. More significantly, we specifically acknowledged that vertical maximumprice fixing "may have procompetitive interbrand effects,"and pointed out that, in the wake of GTE Sylvania, "[t]he522US1 Unit: $$U2 [01-27-00 18:52:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN15Cite as: 522 U. S. 3 (1997)Opinion of the Courtprocompetitive potential of a vertical maximum price re-straint is more evident . . . than it was when Albrecht wasdecided, because exclusive territorial arrangements andother nonprice restrictions were unlawful per se in 1968."495 U. S., at 343, n. 13 (citing several commentators identify-ing procompetitive effects of vertical maximum price fixing,including, e. g., P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law|| 340.30b, p. 378, n. 24 (1988 Supp.); Blair & Harrison, Rethinking Antitrust Injury, 42 Vand. L. Rev. 1539, 1553 (1989);Easterbrook, Maximum Price Fixing, 48 U. Chi. L. Rev. 886,887-890 (1981)) (hereinafter Easterbrook).BThus, our reconsideration of Albrecht's continuing validityis informed by several of our decisions, as well as a considerable body of scholarship discussing the effects of vertical re-straints. Our analysis is also guided by our general viewthat the primary purpose of the antitrust laws is to protectinterbrand competition. See,e. g., Business ElectronicsCorp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., 485 U. S. 717, 726 (1988)."Low prices," we have explained, "benefit consumers regard-less of how those prices are set, and so long as they are abovepredatory levels, they do not threaten competition." ARCO,supra, at 340. Our interpretation of the Sherman Act alsoincorporates the notion that condemnation of practices resulting in lower prices to consumers is "especially costly"because "cutting prices in order to increase business often isthe very essence of competition." Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U. S. 574, 594 (1986).So informed, we find it difficult to maintain that verticallyimposed maximum prices could harm consumers or competi-tion to the extent necessary to justify their per se invalidation. As Chief Judge Posner wrote for the Court of Appealsin this case:"As for maximum resale price fixing, unless the supplieris a monopsonist he cannot squeeze his dealers' margins522US1 Unit: $$U2 [01-27-00 18:52:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN16 STATE OIL CO. v. KHANOpinion of the Courtbelow a competitive level; the attempt to do so wouldjust drive the dealers into the arms of a competing supplier. A supplier might, however, fix a maximum resaleprice in order to prevent his dealers from exploiting amonopoly position. . . . [S]uppose that State Oil, perhapsto encourage . . . dealer services . . . has spaced its dealers sufficiently far apart to limit competition amongthem (or even given each of them an exclusive territory);and suppose further that Union 76 is a sufficiently dis-tinctive and popular brand to give the dealers in it atleast a modicum of monopoly power. Then State Oilmight want to place a ceiling on the dealers' resaleprices in order to prevent them from exploiting that mo-nopoly power fully. It would do this not out of disinterested malice, but in its commercial self-interest. Thehigher the price at which gasoline is resold, the smallerthe volume sold, and so the lower the profit to the sup-plier if the higher profit per gallon at the higher price isbeing snared by the dealer." 93 F. 3d, at 1362.See also R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 281-282 (1978)("There could, of course, be no anticonsumer effect from [thetype of price fixing considered in Albrecht], and one suspectsthat the paper has a legitimate interest in keeping subscriberprices down in order to increase circulation and maximizerevenues from advertising").We recognize that the Albrecht decision presented a num-ber of theoretical justifications for a per se rule against vertical maximum price fixing. But criticism of those premisesabounds. The Albrecht decision was grounded in the fearthat maximum price fixing by suppliers could interfere withdealer freedom. 390 U. S., at 152. In response, as one commentator has pointed out, "the ban on maximum resale pricelimitations declared inAlbrecht in the name of `dealer free-dom' has actually prompted many suppliers to integrateforward into distribution, thus eliminating the very inde-pendent trader for whom Albrecht professed solicitude."522US1 Unit: $$U2 [01-27-00 18:52:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN17Cite as: 522 U. S. 3 (1997)Opinion of the Court8 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law || 1635, p. 395 (1989) (hereinafterAreeda). For example, integration in the newspaper industry since Albrecht has given rise to litigation between independent distributors and publishers. See P. Areeda & H.Hovenkamp, supra, || 729.7, pp. 599-614 (1996 Supp.).The Albrecht Court also expressed the concern that maximum prices may be set too low for dealers to offer consumersessential or desired services. 390 U. S., at 152-153. Butsuch conduct, by driving away customers, would seem likelyto harm manufacturers as well as dealers and consumers,making it unlikely that a supplier would set such a price asa matter of business judgment. See, e. g., Lopatka, StephenBreyer and Modern Antitrust: A Snug Fit, 40 Antitrust Bull.1, 60 (1995); Blair & Lang, Albrecht After ARCO: Maximum Resale Price Fixing Moves Toward the Rule of Reason, 44 Vand. L. Rev. 1007, 1034 (1991). In addition, Albrechtnoted that vertical maximum price fixing could effectivelychannel distribution through large or specially advantageddealers. 390 U. S., at 153. It is unclear, however, that asupplier would profit from limiting its market by excluding potential dealers. See, e. g., Easterbrook 905-908. Further, although vertical maximum price fixing might limit theviability of inefficient dealers, that consequence is not necessarily harmful to competition and consumers. See, e. g., id.,at 907; Lopatka, supra, at 60.Finally, Albrecht reflected the Court's fear that maximumprice fixing could be used to disguise arrangements to fixminimum prices, 390 U. S., at 153, which remain illegal perse. Although we have acknowledged the possibility thatmaximum pricing might mask minimum pricing, see Maricopa County, 457 U. S., at 348, we believe that such conduct--as with the other concerns articulated in Albrecht--can be appropriately recognized and punished under the ruleof reason. See, e. g., Easterbrook 901-904; see also Pitofsky,In Defense of Discounters: The No-Frills Case for a Per Se522US1 Unit: $$U2 [01-27-00 18:52:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN18 STATE OIL CO. v. KHANOpinion of the CourtRule Against Vertical Price Fixing, 71 Geo. L. J. 1487, 1490,n. 17 (1983).Not only are the potential injuries cited in Albrecht lessserious than the Court imagined, the per se rule establishedtherein could in fact exacerbate problems related to the unrestrained exercise of market power by monopolist-dealers.Indeed, both courts and antitrust scholars have noted thatAlbrecht's rule may actually harm consumers and manufacturers. See, e. g., Caribe BMW, Inc. v. Bayerische MotorenWerke Aktiengesellschaft, 19 F. 3d 745, 753 (CA1 1994)(Breyer, C. J.); Areeda || 1636a, at 395; G. Mathewson & R.Winter, Competition Policy and Vertical Exchange 13-14(1985). Other commentators have also explained that Albrecht's per se rule has even more potential for deleteriouseffect on competition after our decision in GTE Sylvania,because, now that vertical nonprice restrictions are not unlawful per se, the likelihood of dealer monopoly power is increased. See, e. g., Easterbrook 890, n. 20; see also ARCO,495 U. S., at 343, n. 13. We do not intend to suggest thatdealers generally possess sufficient market power to exploita monopoly situation. Such retail market power may in factbe uncommon. See, e. g., Business Electronics, 485 U. S., at727, n. 2; GTE Sylvania, 433 U. S., at 54. Nor do we holdthat a ban on vertical maximum price fixing inevitablyhas anticompetitive consequences in the exclusive dealercontext.After reconsidering Albrecht's rationale and the substantial criticism the decision has received, however, we concludethat there is insufficient economic justification for per se invalidation of vertical maximum price fixing. That is so notonly because it is difficult to accept the assumptions underlying Albrecht, but also because Albrecht has little or no relevance to ongoing enforcement of the Sherman Act. SeeCopperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U. S. 752,777, and n. 25 (1984). Moreover, neither the parties nor any522US1 Unit: $$U2 [01-27-00 18:52:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN19Cite as: 522 U. S. 3 (1997)Opinion of the Courtof the amici curiae have called our attention to any cases inwhich enforcement efforts have been directed solely againstthe conduct encompassed by Albrecht's per se rule.Respondents argue that reconsideration of Albrecht shouldrequire "persuasive, expert testimony establishing that theper se rule has distorted the market." Brief for Respondents 7. Their reasoning ignores the fact that Albrecht itselfrelied solely upon hypothetical effects of vertical maximumprice fixing. Further, Albrecht's dire predictions have notbeen borne out, even though manufacturers and suppliersappear to have fashioned schemes to get around the per serule against vertical maximum price fixing. In thesecircumstances, it is the retention of the rule of Albrecht,and not, as respondents would have it, the rule's elimination,that lacks adequate justification. See, e. g., GTE Sylvania,supra, at 58-59.Respondents' reliance on Toolson v. New York Yankees,Inc., 346 U. S. 356 (1953) (per curiam), and Flood v. Kuhn,407 U. S. 258 (1972), is similarly misplaced, because those decisions are clearly inapposite, having to do with the antitrustexemption for professional baseball, which this Court has described as "an aberration . . . rest[ing] on a recognition andan acceptance of baseball's unique characteristics and needs,"id., at 282. In the context of this case, we infer little meaning from the fact that Congress has not reacted legislativelyto Albrecht. In any event, the history of various legislativeproposals regarding price fixing seems neither clearly to support nor to denounce the per se rule of Albrecht. Respondents are of course free to seek legislative protection fromgasoline suppliers of the sort embodied in the PetroleumMarketing Practices Act, 92 Stat. 322, 15 U. S. C. $ 2801 etseq. For the reasons we have noted, however, the remedyfor respondents' dispute with State Oil should not come inthe form of a per se rule affecting the conduct of the entiremarketplace.522US1 Unit: $$U2 [01-27-00 18:52:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN20 STATE OIL CO. v. KHANOpinion of the CourtCDespite what Chief Judge Posner aptly described as Albrecht's "infirmities, [and] its increasingly wobbly, moth-eaten foundations," 93 F. 3d, at 1363, there remains the question whether Albrecht deserves continuing respect under thedoctrine of stare decisis. The Court of Appeals was correctin applying that principle despite disagreement with Al-brecht, for it is this Court's prerogative alone to overrule oneof its precedents.We approach the reconsideration of decisions of this Courtwith the utmost caution. Stare decisis reflects "a policyjudgment that `in most matters it is more important that theapplicable rule of law be settled than that it be settledright.' "Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 235 (1997) (quot-ing Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406(1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)). It "is the preferred coursebecause it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance onjudicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceivedintegrity of the judicial process." Payne v. Tennessee, 501U. S. 808, 827 (1991). This Court has expressed its reluctance to overrule decisions involving statutory interpreta-tion, see,e. g., Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720, 736(1977), and has acknowledged thatstare decisis concerns areat their acme in cases involving property and contract rights,see, e. g., Payne, 501 U. S., at 828. Both of those concernsare arguably relevant in this case.But "[s]tare decisis is not an inexorable command." Ibid.In the area of antitrust law, there is a competing interest,well represented in this Court's decisions, in recognizing andadapting to changed circumstances and the lessons of accumulated experience. Thus, the general presumption thatlegislative changes should be left to Congress has less forcewith respect to the Sherman Act in light of the acceptedview that Congress "expected the courts to give shape tothe statute's broad mandate by drawing on common-law tra522US1 Unit: $$U2 [01-27-00 18:52:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN21Cite as: 522 U. S. 3 (1997)Opinion of the Courtdition." National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. UnitedStates, 435 U. S. 679, 688 (1978). As we have explained, theterm "restraint of trade," as used in $ 1, also "invokes thecommon law itself, and not merely the static content that thecommon law had assigned to the term in 1890." BusinessElectronics, 485 U. S., at 732; see also GTE Sylvania, 433U. S., at 53, n. 21;McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350,372-373 (1987) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Accordingly, thisCourt has reconsidered its decisions construing the Sherman Act when the theoretical underpinnings of those deci-sions are called into serious question. See,e. g., CopperweldCorp., supra, at 777; GTE Sylvania, supra, at 47-49; cf.Tigner v. Texas, 310 U. S. 141, 147 (1940).Although we do not "lightly assume that the economic realities underlying earlier decisions have changed, or that earlier judicial perceptions of those realities were in error," wehave noted that "different sorts of agreements" may amountto restraints of trade "in varying times and circumstances,"and "[i]t would make no sense to create out of the singleterm `restraint of trade' a chronologically schizoid statute, inwhich a `rule of reason' evolves with new circumstances andnew wisdom, but a line of per se illegality remains foreverfixed where it was." Business Electronics, supra, at 731-732. Just as Schwinn was "the subject of continuing controversy and confusion" under the "great weight" of scholarlycriticism, GTE Sylvania, supra, at 47-48, Albrecht has beenwidely criticized since its inception. With the views underlying Albrecht eroded by this Court's precedent, there is notmuch of that decision to salvage. See, e. g., Neal v. UnitedStates, 516 U. S. 284, 295 (1996); Patterson v. McLean CreditUnion, 491 U. S. 164, 173 (1989); Rodriguez de Quijas v.Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 480-481(1989).Although the rule of Albrecht has been in effect for sometime, the inquiry we must undertake requires considering" `the effect of the antitrust laws upon vertical distributional522US1 Unit: $$U2 [01-27-00 18:52:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN22 STATE OIL CO. v. KHANOpinion of the Courtrestraints in the American economy today.' " GTE Syl-vania, supra, at 53, n. 21 (quoting Schwinn, 388 U. S., at 392(Stewart, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)). Asthe Court noted in ARCO, 495 U. S., at 336, n. 6, there hasnot been another case since Albrecht in which this Court has"confronted an unadulterated vertical, maximum-price-fixingarrangement." Now that we confront Albrecht directly, wefind its conceptual foundations gravely weakened.In overruling Albrecht, we of course do not hold that allvertical maximum price fixing isper se lawful. Instead, ver-tical maximum price fixing, like the majority of commercialarrangements subject to the antitrust laws, should be evalu-ated under the rule of reason. In our view, rule-of-reasonanalysis will effectively identify those situations in whichvertical maximum price fixing amounts to anticompetitiveconduct.There remains the question whether respondents are entitled to recover damages based on State Oil's conduct. Al-though the Court of Appeals noted that "the district judgewas right to conclude that if the rule of reason is applicable,Khan loses," 93 F. 3d, at 1362, its consideration of this casewas necessarily premised on Albrecht's per se rule. Underthe circumstances, the matter should be reviewed by theCourt of Appeals in the first instance. We therefore vacatethe judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the casefor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
