S. 516 (1999)Opinion of the Courtnot "substantially limi[t]" one or more of his major life activi-ties and whether it correctly determined that petitioner isnot "regarded as disabled." See $ 12102(2). In light of ourdecision in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., ante, p. 471, weconclude that the Court of Appeals' resolution of both issueswas correct.IPetitioner was first diagnosed with hypertension (highblood pressure) when he was 10 years old. Unmedicated,his blood pressure is approximately 250/160. With medica-tion, however, petitioner's "hypertension does not significantly restrict his activities and . . . in general he can func-tion normally and can engage in activities that other personsnormally do." 946 F. Supp. 872, 875 (Kan. 1996) (discussingtestimony of petitioner's physician).In August 1994, respondent hired petitioner as a mechanic,a position that required petitioner to drive commercial motorvehicles. Petitioner does not challenge the District Court'sconclusion that driving a commercial motor vehicle is an essential function of the mechanic's job at UPS. Id., at 882-883. To drive such vehicles, however, petitioner had to satisfy certain health requirements imposed by the Departmentof Transportation (DOT). 49 CFR $ 391.41(a) (1998) ("A person shall not drive a commercial motor vehicle unless he/sheis physically qualified to do so and . . . has on his/her person. . . a medical examiner's certificate that he/she is physicallyqualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle"). One suchrequirement is that the driver of a commercial motor vehiclein interstate commerce have "no current clinical diagnosis ofhigh blood pressure likely to interfere with his/her ability tooperate a commercial vehicle safely." $ 391.41(b)(6).At the time respondent hired him, petitioner's blood pres-sure was so high, measuring at 186/124, that he was not qualified for DOT health certification, see App. 98a-102a (Depart-ment of Transportation, Medical Regulatory Criteria forEvaluation Under Section 391.41(b)(6), attached as exhibit to527US2 Unit: $U85 [05-02-01 17:39:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN520 MURPHY v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.Opinion of the CourtAffidavit and Testimony of John R. McMahon) (hereinafterMedical Regulatory Criteria). Nonetheless, petitioner waserroneously granted certification, and he commenced work.In September 1994, a UPS medical supervisor who was reviewing petitioner's medical files discovered the error andrequested that petitioner have his blood pressure retested.Upon retesting, petitioner's blood pressure was measured at160/102 and 164/104. See App. 48a (testimony of VaughnMurphy). On October 5, 1994, respondent fired petitioneron the belief that his blood pressure exceeded the DOT's re-quirements for drivers of commercial motor vehicles.Petitioner brought suit under Title I of the ADA in theUnited States District Court for the District of Kansas.The court granted respondent's motion for summary judgment. It held that, to determine whether petitioner is disabled under the ADA, his "impairment should be evaluatedin its medicated state." 946 F. Supp., at 881. Noting thatwhen petitioner is medicated he is inhibited only in liftingheavy objects but otherwise functions normally, the courtheld that petitioner is not "disabled" under the ADA. Id.,at 881-882. The court also rejected petitioner's claim thathe was "regarded as" disabled, holding that respondent "didnot regard Murphy as disabled, only that he was not certifiable under DOT regulations." Id., at 882.The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's judgment. 141 F. 3d 1185 (CA10 1999) ( judgt. order). Citingits decision in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 130 F. 3d 893,902 (CA10 1997), aff 'd, ante, p. 471, that an individual claiming a disability under the ADA should be assessed with regard to any mitigating or corrective measures employed, thecourt held that petitioner's hypertension is not a disabilitybecause his doctor had testified that when petitioner is medicated, he " `functions normally doing everyday activity thatan everyday person does.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a. Thecourt also affirmed the District Court's determination thatpetitioner is not "regarded as" disabled under the ADA. It527US2 Unit: $U85 [05-02-01 17:39:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN521Cite as: 527 U. S. 516 (1999)Opinion of the Courtexplained that respondent did not terminate petitioner "onan unsubstantiated fear that he would suffer a heart attackor stroke," but "because his blood pressure exceeded theDOT's requirements for drivers of commercial vehicles."Id., at 5a. We granted certiorari, 525 U. S. 1063 (1999), andwe now affirm.IIThe first question presented in this case is whether thedetermination of petitioner's disability is made with reference to the mitigating measures he employs. We have an-swered that question in Sutton in the affirmative. Giventhat holding, the result in this case is clear. The Court ofAppeals concluded that, when medicated, petitioner's highblood pressure does not substantially limit him in any majorlife activity. Petitioner did not seek, and we did not grant,certiorari on whether this conclusion was correct. Becausethe question whether petitioner is disabled when takingmedication is not before us, we have no occasion here to con-sider whether petitioner is "disabled" due to limitations thatpersist despite his medication or the negative side effects ofhis medication. Instead, the question granted was limitedto whether, under the ADA, the determination of whetheran individual's impairment "substantially limits" one or moremajor life activities should be made without considerationof mitigating measures. Consequently, we conclude that theCourt of Appeals correctly affirmed the grant of summaryjudgment in respondent's favor on the claim that petitioneris substantially limited in one or more major life activitiesand thus disabled under the ADA.IIIThe second issue presented is also largely resolved by ouropinion inSutton. Petitioner argues that the Court of Ap-peals erred in holding that he is not "regarded as" disabledbecause of his high blood pressure. As we held in Sutton,ante, at 489, a person is "regarded as" disabled within the527US2 Unit: $U85 [05-02-01 17:39:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN522 MURPHY v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.Opinion of the Courtmeaning of the ADA if a covered entity mistakenly believesthat the person's actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities. Here, peti-tioner alleges that his hypertension is regarded as substantially limiting him in the major life activity of working, whenin fact it does not. To support this claim, he points to testi-mony from respondent's resource manager that respondentfired petitioner due to his hypertension, which he claims evi-dences respondent's belief that petitioner's hypertension--and consequent inability to obtain DOT certification--sub-stantially limits his ability to work. In response, respondent argues that it does not regard petitioner as substantiallylimited in the major life activity of working but, rather, regards him as unqualified to work as a UPS mechanic becausehe is unable to obtain DOT health certification.As a preliminary matter, we note that there remains somedispute as to whether petitioner meets the requirements forDOT certification. As discussed above, petitioner was incorrectly granted DOT certification at his first examinationwhen he should have instead been found unqualified. Seesupra, at 519-520. Upon retesting, although petitioner'sblood pressure was not low enough to qualify him for the1-year certification that he had incorrectly been issued, itwas sufficient to qualify him for optional temporary DOThealth certification. App. 98a-102a (Medical RegulatoryCriteria). Had a physician examined petitioner and, in lightof his medical history, declined to issue a temporary DOTcertification, we would not second-guess that decision.Here, however, it appears that UPS determined that petitioner could not meet the DOT standards and did not allowhim to attempt to obtain the optional temporary certification.Id., at 84a-86a (testimony of Monica Sloan, UPS' companynurse); id., at 54a-55a (testimony and affidavit of VaughnMurphy). We need not resolve the question whether petitioner could meet the standards for DOT health certification,however, as it goes only to whether petitioner is qualified527US2 Unit: $U85 [05-02-01 17:39:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN523Cite as: 527 U. S. 516 (1999)Opinion of the Courtand whether respondent has a defense based on the DOTregulations, seeAlbertson's, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, post, p. 555,issues not addressed by the court below or raised in the peti-tion for certiorari.The only issue remaining is whether the evidence thatpetitioner is regarded as unable to obtain DOT certification(regardless of whether he can, in fact, obtain optional temporary certification) is sufficient to create a genuine issue ofmaterial fact as to whether petitioner is regarded as substantially limited in one or more major life activities. As in Sutton, ante, at 491-492, we assume, arguendo, that the EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulationsregarding the disability determination are valid. When referring to the major life activity of working, the EEOC defines "substantially limits" as: "significantly restricted in theability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range ofjobs in various classes as compared to the average personhaving comparable training, skills and abilities." 29 CFR$ 1630.2( j)(3)(i) (1998). The EEOC further identifies severalfactors that courts should consider when determiningwhether an individual is substantially limited in the majorlife activity of working, including "the number and types ofjobs utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities,within [the] geographical area [reasonably accessible to theindividual], from which the individual is also disqualified."$ 1630.2( j)(3)(ii)(B). Thus, to be regarded as substantiallylimited in the major life activity of working, one must beregarded as precluded from more than a particular job. See$ 1630.2( j)(3)(i) ("The inability to perform a single, particularjob does not constitute a substantial limitation in the majorlife activity of working").Again, assuming without deciding that these regulationsare valid, petitioner has failed to demonstrate that there isa genuine issue of material fact as to whether he is regardedas disabled. Petitioner was fired from the position of UPSmechanic because he has a physical impairment--hyperten527US2 Unit: $U85 [05-02-01 17:39:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN524 MURPHY v. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.Opinion of the Courtsion--that is regarded as preventing him from obtainingDOT health certification. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a(UPS terminated Murphy because "his blood pressure exceeded the DOT's requirements for drivers of commercial vehicles"); 946 F. Supp., at 882 ("[T]he court concludes UPS didnot regard Murphy as disabled, only that he was not certifiable under DOT regulations"); App. 125a, || 18 (Defendant'sMemorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment)("UPS considers driving commercial motor vehicles an essential function of plaintiff 's job as mechanic"); id., at 103a(testimony of John R. McMahon) (stating that the reason whypetitioner was fired was that he "did not meet the requirements of the Department of Transportation").The evidence that petitioner is regarded as unable to meetthe DOT regulations is not sufficient to create a genuineissue of material fact as to whether petitioner is regarded asunable to perform a class of jobs utilizing his skills. Atmost, petitioner has shown that he is regarded as unable toperform the job of mechanic only when that job requiresdriving a commercial motor vehicle--a specific type of vehicle used on a highway in interstate commerce. 49 CFR$ 390.5 (1998) (defining "commercial motor vehicle" as a vehicle weighing over 10,000 pounds, designed to carry 16 ormore passengers, or used in the transportation of hazardousmaterials). Petitioner has put forward no evidence that heis regarded as unable to perform any mechanic job that doesnot call for driving a commercial motor vehicle and thus doesnot require DOT certification. Indeed, it is undisputed thatpetitioner is generally employable as a mechanic. Petitionerhas "performed mechanic jobs that did not require DOT certification" for "over 22 years," and he secured another job asa mechanic shortly after leaving UPS. 946 F. Supp., at 875,876. Moreover, respondent presented uncontroverted evidence that petitioner could perform jobs such as diesel mechanic, automotive mechanic, gas-engine repairer, and gas527US2 Unit: $U85 [05-02-01 17:39:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN525Cite as: 527 U. S. 516 (1999)Stevens, J., dissentingwelding equipment mechanic, all of which utilize petitioner'smechanical skills. See App. 115a (report of Lewis Vierling).Consequently, in light of petitioner's skills and the arrayof jobs available to petitioner utilizing those skills, petitionerhas failed to show that he is regarded as unable to performa class of jobs. Rather, the undisputed record evidencedemonstrates that petitioner is, at most, regarded as unableto perform only a particular job. This is insufficient, as amatter of law, to prove that petitioner is regarded as sub-stantially limited in the major life activity of working. SeeSutton, ante, at 492-493. Accordingly, the Court of Appealscorrectly granted summary judgment in favor of respondenton petitioner's claim that he is regarded as disabled. Forthe reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the Court ofAppeals for the Tenth Circuit. It is so ordered.Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Breyer joins,dissenting.For the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in Suttonv.United Air Lines, Inc., ante, at 495, I respectfully dissent.I believe that petitioner has a "disability" within the meaning of the ADA because, assuming petitioner's uncontestedevidence to be true, his very severe hypertension--in its unmedicated state--"substantially limits" his ability to performseveral major life activities. Without medication, petitionerwould likely be hospitalized. See App. 81. Indeed, unlikeSutton, this case scarcely requires us to speculate whetherCongress intended the Act to cover individuals with this impairment. Severe hypertension, in my view, easily fallswithin the ADA's nucleus of covered impairments. See Sutton, ante, at 496-503 (Stevens, J., dissenting).Because the Court of Appeals did not address whetherpetitioner was qualified or whether he could perform theessential job functions, App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a, I wouldreverse and remand for further proceedings.527US2 Unit: $U86 [05-02-01 17:54:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN526 OCTOBER TERM, 1998SyllabusKOLSTAD v. AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATIONcertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuitNo. 98-208. Argued March 1, 1999--Decided June 22, 1999Petitioner sued respondent under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964(Title VII), asserting that respondent's decision to promote Tom Spangler over her was a proscribed act of gender discrimination. Petitioneralleged, and introduced testimony to prove, that, among other things,the entire selection process was a sham, the stated reasons of respondent's executive director for selecting Spangler were pretext, and Spangler had been chosen before the formal selection process began. TheDistrict Court denied petitioner's request for a jury instruction on punitive damages, which are authorized by the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (1991Act) for Title VII cases in which the employee "demonstrates" that theemployer has engaged in intentional discrimination and has done so"with malice or with reckless indifference to [the employee's] federallyprotected rights." 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a(b)(1). In affirming that denial,the en banc Court of Appeals concluded that, before the jury can beinstructed on punitive damages, the evidence must demonstrate thatthe defendant has engaged in some "egregious" misconduct, and thatpetitioner had failed to make the requisite showing in this case.Held:1. An employer's conduct need not be independently "egregious" tosatisfy $ 1981a's requirements for a punitive damages award, althoughevidence of egregious behavior may provide a valuable means by whichan employee can show the "malice" or "reckless indifference" needed toqualify for such an award. The 1991 Act provided for compensatoryand punitive damages in addition to the backpay and other equitablerelief to which prevailing Title VII plaintiffs had previously been limited. Section 1981a's two-tiered structure--it limits compensatory andpunitive awards to cases of "intentional discrimination," $ 1981a(a)(1),and further qualifies the availability of punitive awards to instances of"malice" or "reckless indifference"--suggests a congressional intent toimpose two standards of liability, one for establishing a right to compensatory damages and another, higher standard that a plaintiff must satisfy to qualify for a punitive award. The terms "malice" and "recklessindifference" ultimately focus on the actor's state of mind, however, and$ 1981a does not require a showing of egregious or outrageous discrimination independent of the employer's state of mind. Nor does the stat527US2 Unit: $U86 [05-02-01 17:54:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN527Cite as: 527 U. S. 526 (1999)Syllabusute's structure imply an independent role for "egregiousness" in the faceof congressional silence. On the contrary, the view that $ 1981a provides for punitive awards based solely on an employer's state of mind isconsistent with the 1991 Act's distinction between equitable and compensatory relief. Intent determines which remedies are open to aplaintiff here as well. This focus on the employer's state of mind doesgive effect to the statute's two-tiered structure. The terms "malice"and "reckless indifference" pertain not to the employer's awareness thatit is engaging in discrimination, but to its knowledge that it may beacting in violation of federal law, see, e. g., Smith v. Wade, 461 U. S. 30,37, n. 6, 41, 50. There will be circumstances where intentional discrimination does not give rise to punitive damages liability under this standard, as where the employer is unaware of the relevant federal prohibition or discriminates with the distinct belief that its discrimination islawful, where the underlying theory of discrimination is novel or otherwise poorly recognized, or where the employer reasonably believes thatits discrimination satisfies a bona fide occupational qualification defenseor other statutory exception to liability. See Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U. S. 604, 616, 617. Although there is some support forrespondent's assertion that the common law punitive awards traditionincludes an "egregious misconduct" requirement, eligibility for suchawards most often is characterized in terms of a defendant's evil motiveor intent. Egregious or outrageous acts may serve as evidence supporting an inference of such evil motive, but $ 1981a does not limit plaintiffs to this form of evidence or require a showing of egregious or outrageous discrimination independent of the employer's state of mind.Pp. 533-539.2. The inquiry does not end with a showing of the requisite mentalstate by certain employees, however. Petitioner must impute liabilityfor punitive damages to respondent. Common law limitations on aprincipal's vicarious liability for its agents' acts apply in the Title VIIcontext. See, e. g., Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U. S. 742,754. The Court's discussion of this question is informed by the generalcommon law of agency, as codified in the Restatement (Second) ofAgency, see, e. g., id., at 755, which, among other things, authorizes punitive damages "against a . . . principal because of an [agent's] act . . .if . . . the agent was employed in a managerial capacity and was acting inthe scope of employment," $ 217 C(c), and declares that even intentional,specifically forbidden torts are within such scope if the conduct is "thekind [the employee] is employed to perform," "occurs substantiallywithin the authorized time and space limits," and "is actuated, at leastin part, by a purpose to serve the" employer, $$ 228(1), 230, Commentb. Under these rules, even an employer who made every good faith527US2 Unit: $U86 [05-02-01 17:54:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN528 KOLSTAD v. AMERICAN DENTAL ASSN.Syllabuseffort to comply with Title VII would be held liable for the discriminatory acts of agents acting in a "managerial capacity." Holding such anemployer liable, however, is in some tension with the principle that it is"improper . . . to award punitive damages against one who himself ispersonally innocent and therefore liable only vicariously," Restatement(Second) of Torts $ 909, Comment b. Applying the Restatement ofAgency's "scope of employment" rule in this context, moreover, wouldreduce the incentive for employers to implement antidiscrimination programs and would, in fact, likely exacerbate employers' concerns that 42U. S. C. $ 1981a's "malice" and "reckless indifference" standard penalizesthose employers who educate themselves and their employees on TitleVII's prohibitions. Dissuading employers from implementing programsor policies to prevent workplace discrimination is directly contrary toTitle VII's prophylactic purposes. See, e. g., Burlington Industries,Inc., 524 U. S., at 764. Thus, the Court is compelled to modify the Restatement rules to avoid undermining Title VII's objectives. See, e. g.,ibid. The Court therefore agrees that, in the punitive damages context,an employer may not be vicariously liable for the discriminatory employment decisions of managerial agents where these decisions are contrary to the employer's good faith efforts to comply with Title VII.Pp. 539-546.3. The question whether petitioner can identify facts sufficient to support an inference that the requisite mental state can be imputed to respondent is left for remand. The parties have not yet had an opportunity to marshal the record evidence in support of their views on theapplication of agency principles in this case, and the en banc Court ofAppeals had no reason to resolve the issue because it concluded thatpetitioner had failed to demonstrate the requisite "egregious" misconduct.

We hereconsider the circumstances under which punitive damagesmay be awarded in an action under Title VII.IAIn September 1992, Jack O'Donnell announced that hewould be retiring as the Director of Legislation and Legislative Policy and Director of the Council on Government Af-fairs and Federal Dental Services for respondent, AmericanDental Association (respondent or Association). Petitioner,Carole Kolstad, was employed with O'Donnell in respondent's Washington, D. C., office, where she was serving asrespondent's Director of Federal Agency Relations. Whenshe learned of O'Donnell's retirement, she expressed an in-terest in filling his position. Also interested in replacingO'Donnell was Tom Spangler, another employee in respond-ent's Washington office. At this time, Spangler was serving as the Association's Legislative Counsel, a position thatinvolved him in respondent's legislative lobbying efforts.Both petitioner and Spangler had worked directly withO'Donnell, and both had received "distinguished" performance ratings by the acting head of the Washington office,Leonard Wheat.Both petitioner and Spangler formally applied for O'Don-nell's position, and Wheat requested that Dr. William Allen,then serving as respondent's Executive Director in the Asso-ciation's Chicago office, make the ultimate promotion decision. After interviewing both petitioner and Spangler,Wheat recommended that Allen select Spangler for O'Donnell's post. Allen notified petitioner in December 1992 thathe had, in fact, selected Spangler to serve as O'Donnell's re527US2 Unit: $U86 [05-02-01 17:54:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN531Cite as: 527 U. S. 526 (1999)Opinion of the Courtplacement. Petitioner's challenge to this employment deci-sion forms the basis of the instant action.BAfter first exhausting her avenues for relief before theEqual Employment Opportunity Commission, petitioner filedsuit against the Association in Federal District Court, alleg-ing that respondent's decision to promote Spangler was anact of employment discrimination proscribed under Title VII.In petitioner's view, the entire selection process was a sham.Tr. 8 (Oct. 26, 1995) (closing argument for plaintiff 's counsel).Counsel for petitioner urged the jury to conclude that Allen'sstated reasons for selecting Spangler were pretext for gen-der discrimination,id., at 19, 24, and that Spangler had beenchosen for the position before the formal selection processbegan, id., at 19. Among the evidence offered in support ofthis view, there was testimony to the effect that Allen modified the description of O'Donnell's post to track aspects ofthe job description used to hire Spangler. Seeid., at 132-136 (Oct. 19, 1995) (testimony of Cindy Simms); id., at 48-51(Oct. 20, 1995) (testimony of Leonard Wheat). In petition-er's view, this "preselection" procedure suggested an intentby the Association to discriminate on the basis of sex. Id.,at 24. Petitioner also introduced testimony at trial thatWheat told sexually offensive jokes and that he had referredto certain prominent professional women in derogatoryterms. See id., at 120-124 (Oct. 18, 1995) (testimony of Car-ole Kolstad). Moreover, Wheat allegedly refused to meetwith petitioner for several weeks regarding her interest inO'Donnell's position. Seeid., at 112-113. Petitioner testi-fied, in fact, that she had historically experienced difficultygaining access to meet with Wheat. See id., at 114-115.Allen, for his part, testified that he conducted informal meet-ings regarding O'Donnell's position with both petitioner andSpangler, see id., at 148 (Oct. 23, 1995), although petitioner527US2 Unit: $U86 [05-02-01 17:54:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN532 KOLSTAD v.

The jury concluded thatrespondent had discriminated against petitioner on the basisof sex and awarded her backpay totaling $52,718. App. 109-110. Although the District Court subsequently denied respondent's motion for judgment as a matter of law on theissue of liability, the court made clear that it had not beenpersuaded that respondent had selected Spangler over peti-tioner on the basis of sex, and the court denied petitioner'srequests for reinstatement and for attorney's fees. 912F. Supp. 13, 15 (DC 1996).Petitioner appealed from the District Court's decisions denying her requested jury instruction on punitive damagesand her request for reinstatement and attorney's fees. Respondent cross-appealed from the denial of its motion forjudgment as a matter of law. In a split decision, a panel ofthe Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversedthe District Court's decision denying petitioner's request foran instruction on punitive damages. 108 F. 3d 1431, 1435(1997). In so doing, the court rejected respondent's claimthat punitive damages are available under Title VII onlyin " `extraordinarily egregious cases.' " Id., at 1437. Thepanel reasoned that, "because `the state of mind necessaryto trigger liability for the wrong is at least as culpable asthat required to make punitive damages applicable,' " id., at1438 (quoting Rowlett v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 832 F. 2d 194,205 (CA1 1987)), the fact that the jury could reasonably havefound intentional discrimination meant that the jury shouldhave been permitted to consider punitive damages. Thecourt noted, however, that not all cases involving intentionaldiscrimination would support a punitive damages award.108 F. 3d, at 1438. Such an award might be improper, thepanel reasoned, in instances where the employer justifiablybelieves that intentional discrimination is permitted or527US2 Unit: $U86 [05-02-01 17:54:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN533Cite as: 527 U. S. 526 (1999)Opinion of the Courtwhere an employee engages in discrimination outside thescope of that employee's authority. Id., at 1438-1439.Here, the court concluded, respondent "neither attempted tojustify the use of sex in its promotion decision nor disavowedthe actions of its agents." Id., at 1439.The Court of Appeals subsequently agreed to rehear thecase en banc, limited to the punitive damages question. Ina divided opinion, the court affirmed the decision of the District Court. 139 F. 3d 958 (1998). The en banc majorityconcluded that, "before the question of punitive damages cango to the jury, the evidence of the defendant's culpabilitymust exceed what is needed to show intentional discrimination." Id., at 961. Based on the 1991 Act's structure andlegislative history, the court determined, specifically, that adefendant must be shown to have engaged in some "egre-gious" misconduct before the jury is permitted to consider arequest for punitive damages. Id., at 965. Although thecourt declined to set out the "egregiousness" requirement inany detail, it concluded that petitioner failed to make therequisite showing in the instant case. Judge Randolph concurred, relying chiefly on $ 1981a's structure as evidence of acongressional intent to "limi[t] punitive damages to exceptional cases." Id., at 970. Judge Tatel wrote in dissent forfive judges, who agreed generally with the panel majority.We granted certiorari, 525 U. S. 960 (1998), to resolve aconflict among the Federal Courts of Appeals concerning thecircumstances under which a jury may consider a request forpunitive damages under $ 1981a(b)(1). Compare 139 F. 3d958 (CADC 1998) (case below), with Luciano v. Olsten Corp.,110 F. 3d 210, 219-220 (CA2 1997) (rejecting contention thatpunitive damages require showing of "extraordinarily egre-gious" conduct).IIAPrior to 1991, only equitable relief, primarily backpay, wasavailable to prevailing Title VII plaintiffs; the statute pro527US2 Unit: $U86 [05-02-01 17:54:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN534 KOLSTAD v. AMERICAN DENTAL ASSN.Opinion of the Courtvided no authority for an award of punitive or compensatorydamages. SeeLandgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S.244, 252-253 (1994). With the passage of the 1991 Act, Con-gress provided for additional remedies, including punitivedamages, for certain classes of Title VII and ADA violations.The 1991 Act limits compensatory and punitive damagesawards, however, to cases of "intentional discrimination"--that is, cases that do not rely on the "disparate impact" the-ory of discrimination. 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a(a)(1). Section1981a(b)(1) further qualifies the availability of punitiveawards:"A complaining party may recover punitive damagesunder this section against a respondent (other than agovernment, government agency or political subdivi-sion) if the complaining party demonstrates that therespondent engaged in a discriminatory practice ordiscriminatory practiceswith malice or with recklessindifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual." (Emphasis added.)The very structure of $ 1981a suggests a congressional in-tent to authorize punitive awards in only a subset of casesinvolving intentional discrimination. Section 1981a(a)(1)limits compensatory and punitive awards to instances ofintentional discrimination, while $ 1981a(b)(1) requires plaintiffs to make an additional "demonstrat[ion]" of their eligibil-ity for punitive damages. Congress plainly sought to impose two standards of liability--one for establishing a rightto compensatory damages and another, higher standard thata plaintiff must satisfy to qualify for a punitive award.The Court of Appeals sought to give life to this two-tieredstructure by limiting punitive awards to cases involvingintentional discrimination of an "egregious" nature. Wecredit the en banc majority's effort to effectuate congressional intent, but, in the end, we reject its conclusion thateligibility for punitive damages can only be described in527US2 Unit: $U86 [05-02-01 17:54:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN535Cite as: 527 U. S. 526 (1999)Opinion of the Courtterms of an employer's "egregious" misconduct. The terms"malice" and "reckless" ultimately focus on the actor's stateof mind. See, e. g., Black's Law Dictionary 956-957, 1270(6th ed. 1990); see also W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton, Law of Torts 212-214 (5th ed.1984) (defining "willful," "wanton," and "reckless"). Whileegregious misconduct is evidence of the requisite mentalstate, see infra, at 538-539; Keeton, supra, at 213-214,$ 1981a does not limit plaintiffs to this form of evidence, andthe section does not require a showing of egregious or out-rageous discrimination independent of the employer's stateof mind. Nor does the statute's structure imply an independent role for "egregiousness" in the face of congressional silence. On the contrary, the view that $ 1981a provides forpunitive awards based solely on an employer's state of mindis consistent with the 1991 Act's distinction between equitable and compensatory relief. Intent determines which remedies are open to a plaintiff here as well; compensatory awardsare available only where the employer has engaged in "intentional discrimination." $ 1981a(a)(1) (emphasis added).Moreover, $ 1981a's focus on the employer's state of mindgives some effect to Congress' apparent intent to narrow theclass of cases for which punitive awards are available to asubset of those involving intentional discrimination. Theemployer must act with "malice or with reckless indifferenceto the [plaintiff 's] federally protected rights." $ 1981a(b)(1)(emphasis added). The terms "malice" or "reckless indifference" pertain to the employer's knowledge that it may beacting in violation of federal law, not its awareness that it isengaging in discrimination.We gain an understanding of the meaning of the terms"malice" and "reckless indifference," as used in $ 1981a, fromthis Court's decision in Smith v. Wade, 461 U. S. 30 (1983).The parties, as well as both the en banc majority and dissent,recognize that Congress looked to the Court's decision inSmith in adopting this language in $ 1981a. See Tr. of Oral527US2 Unit: $U86 [05-02-01 17:54:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN536 KOLSTAD v. AMERICAN DENTAL ASSN.Opinion of the CourtArg. 28-29; Brief for Petitioner 24; 139 F. 3d, at 964-965; id.,at 971 (Tatel, J., dissenting). Employing language similar towhat later appeared in $ 1981a, the Court concluded in Smiththat "a jury may be permitted to assess punitive damages inan action under $ 1983 when the defendant's conduct is shownto be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involvesreckless or callous indifference to the federally protectedrights of others." 461 U. S., at 56. While the Smith Courtdetermined that it was unnecessary to show actual malice toqualify for a punitive award, id., at 45-48, its intent stand-ard, at a minimum, required recklessness in its subjectiveform. The Court referred to a "subjective consciousness" ofa risk of injury or illegality and a " `criminal indifference tocivil obligations.' " Id., at 37, n. 6, 41 (quoting Philadelphia,W. & B. R. Co. v. Quigley, 21 How. 202, 214 (1859)); see alsoFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 837 (1994) (explaining thatcriminal law employs a subjective form of recklessness, requiring a finding that the defendant "disregards a risk ofharm of which he is aware"); see generally 1 T. Sedgwick,Measure of Damages $$ 366, 368, pp. 528, 529 (8th ed. 1891)(describing "wantonness" in punitive damages context interms of "criminal indifference" and "gross negligence" interms of a "conscious indifference to consequences"). TheCourt thus compared the recklessness standard to the requirement that defendants act with " `knowledge of falsity orreckless disregard for the truth' " before punitive awards areavailable in defamation actions, Smith, supra, at 50 (quoting Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 349 (1974)),a subjective standard, Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc.v. Connaughton, 491 U. S. 657, 688 (1989). Applying thisstandard in the context of $ 1981a, an employer must at leastdiscriminate in the face of a perceived risk that its actionswill violate federal law to be liable in punitive damages.There will be circumstances where intentional discrimination does not give rise to punitive damages liability underthis standard. In some instances, the employer may simply527US2 Unit: $U86 [05-02-01 17:54:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN537Cite as: 527 U. S. 526 (1999)Opinion of the Courtbe unaware of the relevant federal prohibition. There willbe cases, moreover, in which the employer discriminateswith the distinct belief that its discrimination is lawful. Theunderlying theory of discrimination may be novel or otherwise poorly recognized, or an employer may reasonably believe that its discrimination satisfies a bona fide occupationalqualification defense or other statutory exception to liability.See, e. g., 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(e)(1) (setting out Title VII de-fense "where religion, sex, or national origin is a bona fideoccupational qualification"); see also $ 12113 (setting out de-fenses under ADA). InHazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507U. S. 604, 616 (1993), we thus observed that, in light of statutory defenses and other exceptions permitting age-based decisionmaking, an employer may knowingly rely on age tomake employment decisions without recklessly violating theAge Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA).Accordingly, we determined that limiting liquidated damagesunder the ADEA to cases where the employer "knew orshowed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the statute," without an additionalshowing of outrageous conduct, was sufficient to give effectto the ADEA's two-tiered liability scheme. Id., at 616, 617.At oral argument, respondent urged that the common lawtradition surrounding punitive awards includes an "egregious misconduct" requirement. See, e. g., Tr. of Oral Arg.26-28; see also Brief for Chamber of Commerce of the UnitedStates as Amicus Curiae 8-22 (advancing this argument).We assume that Congress, in legislating on punitive awards,imported common law principles governing this form of relief. See, e. g., Molzof v. United States, 502 U. S. 301, 307(1992). Moreover, some courts and commentators have described punitive awards as requiring both a specified stateof mind and egregious or aggravated misconduct. See, e. g.,1 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies 468 (2d ed. 1993) ("Punitivedamages are awarded when the defendant is guilty of both abad state of mind and highly serious misconduct").527US2 Unit: $U86 [05-02-01 17:54:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN538 KOLSTAD v. AMERICAN DENTAL ASSN.Opinion of the CourtMost often, however, eligibility for punitive awards ischaracterized in terms of a defendant's motive or intent.See, e. g., 1 Sedgwick, supra, at 526, 528; C. McCormick, Lawof Damages 280 (1935). Indeed, "[t]he justification of exemplary damages lies in the evil intent of the defendant." 1Sedgwick, supra, at 526; see also 2 J. Sutherland, Law ofDamages $ 390, p. 1079 (3d ed. 1903) (discussing punitivedamages under rubric of "[c]ompensation for wrongs donewith bad motive"). Accordingly, "a positive element of conscious wrongdoing is always required." McCormick, supra,at 280.Egregious misconduct is often associated with the awardof punitive damages, but the reprehensible character of theconduct is not generally considered apart from the requisitestate of mind. Conduct warranting punitive awards hasbeen characterized as "egregious," for example, because ofthe defendant's mental state. See Restatement (Second) ofTorts $ 908(2) (1979) ("Punitive damages may be awarded forconduct that is outrageous, because of the defendant's evilmotive or his reckless indifference to the rights of others").Respondent, in fact, appears to endorse this characterization.See, e. g., Brief for Respondent 19 ("Malicious and recklessconduct [is] by definition egregious"); see also id., at 28-29.That conduct committed with the specified mental state maybe characterized as egregious, however, is not to say thatemployers must engage in conduct with some independent,"egregious" quality before being subject to a punitive award.To be sure, egregious or outrageous acts may serve as evidence supporting an inference of the requisite "evil motive.""The allowance of exemplary damages depends upon the badmotive of the wrong-doer as exhibited by his acts." 1 Sedgwick, supra, at 529 (emphasis added); see also 2 Sutherland, supra, $ 394, at 1101 ("The spirit which actuated thewrong-doer may doubtless be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the parties and the transaction"); see,e. g., Chizmar v. Mackie, 896 P. 2d 196, 210 (Alaska 1995)527US2 Unit: $U86 [05-02-01 17:54:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN539Cite as: 527 U. S. 526 (1999)Opinion of the Court("[W]here there is no evidence that gives rise to an inferenceof actual malice or conduct sufficiently outrageous to bedeemed equivalent to actual malice, the trial court need not,and indeed should not, submit the issue of punitive damagesto the jury" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Horton v.Union Light, Heat & Power Co., 690 S. W. 2d 382, 389 (Ky.1985) (observing that "malice . . . may be implied from outrageous conduct"). Likewise, under $ 1981a(b)(1), pointing toevidence of an employer's egregious behavior would provideone means of satisfying the plaintiff 's burden to "demon-strat[e]" that the employer acted with the requisite "maliceor . . . reckless indifference." See 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a(b)(1);see,e. g., 3 BNA EEOC Compliance Manual N:6085-N6084(1992) (Enforcement Guidance: Compensatory and PunitiveDamages Available Under $ 102 of the Civil Rights Act of1991) (listing "[t]he degree of egregiousness and nature ofthe respondent's conduct" among evidence tending to showmalice or reckless disregard). Again, however, respondenthas not shown that the terms "reckless indifference" and"malice," in the punitive damages context, have taken on aconsistent definition including an independent, "egregious-ness" requirement. Cf.Morissette v. United States, 342U. S. 246, 263 (1952) ("[W]here Congress borrows terms ofart in which are accumulated the legal tradition and meaningof centuries of practice, it presumably knows and adopts thecluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed wordin the body of learning from which it was taken and themeaning its use will convey to the judicial mind unless other-wise instructed").BThe inquiry does not end with a showing of the requisite"malice or . . . reckless indifference" on the part of certainindividuals, however. 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a(b)(1). The plain-tiff must impute liability for punitive damages to respondent.The en banc dissent recognized that agency principles placelimits on vicarious liability for punitive damages. 139 F. 3d,527US2 Unit: $U86 [05-02-01 17:54:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN540 KOLSTAD v. AMERICAN DENTAL ASSN.Opinion of the Courtat 974 (Tatel, J., dissenting). Likewise, the Solicitor Generalasamicus acknowledged during argument that common lawlimitations on a principal's liability in punitive awards for theacts of its agents apply in the Title VII context. Tr. of OralArg. 23.Justice Stevens urges that we should not consider theselimitations here. Seepost, at 552-553 (opinion concurringin part and dissenting in part). While we decline to engagein any definitive application of the agency standards to thefacts of this case, see infra, at 546, it is important that weaddress the proper legal standards for imputing liability toan employer in the punitive damages context. This issue isintimately bound up with the preceding discussion on theevidentiary showing necessary to qualify for a punitive award,and it is easily subsumed within the question on which wegranted certiorari--namely, "[i]n what circumstances maypunitive damages be awarded under Title VII of the 1964Civil Rights Act, as amended, for unlawful intentional discrimination?" Pet. for Cert. i; see also this Court's Rule14.1(a). "On a number of occasions, this Court has considered issues waived by the parties below and in the petitionfor certiorari because the issues were so integral to decisionof the case that they could be considered `fairly subsumed'by the actual questions presented." Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U. S. 20, 37 (1991) (Stevens, J.,dissenting) (citing cases). The Court has not always confined itself to the set of issues addressed by the parties.See, e. g., Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523U. S. 83, 93-102, and n. 1 (1998); H. J. Inc. v. NorthwesternBell Telephone Co., 492 U. S. 229, 243-249 (1989); Continental Ill. Nat. Bank & Trust Co. v. Chicago R. I. & P. R. Co.,294 U. S. 648, 667-675 (1935). Here, moreover, limitationson the extent to which principals may be liable in punitivedamages for the torts of their agents was the subject of discussion by both the en banc majority and dissent, see 139F. 3d, at 968; id., at 974 (Tatel, J., dissenting), amicus527US2 Unit: $U86 [05-02-01 17:54:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN541Cite as: 527 U.

Nor did respondent discount the notion that agencyprinciples may place limits on an employer's vicarious liability for punitive damages. See post, at 552. In fact, respond-ent advanced the general position "that the higher agencyprinciples, under common law, would apply to punitive dam-ages." Tr. of Oral Arg. 49. Accordingly, we conclude thatthese potential limitations on the extent of respondent's lia-bility are properly considered in the instant case.The common law has long recognized that agency principles limit vicarious liability for punitive awards. See, e. g.,G. Field, Law of Damages $$ 85-87 (1876); 1 Sedgwick, Damages $ 378; McCormick, Damages $ 80; 2 F. Mechem, Law ofAgency $$ 2014-2015 (2d ed. 1914). This is a principle,moreover, that this Court historically has endorsed. See,e. g., Lake Shore & Michigan Southern R. Co. v. Prentice,147 U. S. 101, 114-115 (1893); The Amiable Nancy, 3 Wheat.546, 558-559 (1818). Courts of Appeals, too, have relied onthese liability limits in interpreting 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a. See,e. g., Dudley v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 166 F. 3d 1317, 1322-1323 (CA11 1999); Harris v. L & L Wings, Inc., 132 F. 3d978, 983-985 (CA4 1997). See also Fitzgerald v. MountainStates Telephone & Telegraph Co., 68 F. 3d 1257, 1263-1264(CA10 1995) (same in suit under 42 U. S. C. $ 1981). But seeDeffenbaugh-Williams v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 156 F. 3d581, 592-594 (CA5 1998), rehearing en banc ordered, 169F. 3d 215 (1999).We have observed that, "[i]n express terms, Congress hasdirected federal courts to interpret Title VII based onagency principles." Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth,524 U. S. 742, 754 (1998); see also Meritor Savings Bank,FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57, 72 (1986) (noting that, in interpreting Title VII, "Congress wanted courts to look to agencyprinciples for guidance"). Observing the limits on liability527US2 Unit: $U86 [05-02-01 17:54:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN542 KOLSTAD v. AMERICAN DENTAL ASSN.Opinion of the Courtthat these principles impose is especially important when interpreting the 1991 Act. In promulgating the Act, Congressconspicuously left intact the "limits of employer liability" established in Meritor. Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U. S.775, 804, n. 4 (1998); see also Burlington Industries, Inc.,supra, at 763-764 ("[W]e are bound by our holding in Meritor that agency principles constrain the imposition of vicarious liability in cases of supervisory harassment").Although jurisdictions disagree over whether and howto limit vicarious liability for punitive damages, see, e. g., 2J. Ghiardi & J. Kircher, Punitive Damages: Law and Practice$ 24.01 (1998) (discussing disagreement); 22 Am. Jur. 2d,Damages $ 788 (1988) (same), our interpretation of Title VIIis informed by "the general common law of agency, ratherthan . . . the law of any particular State." Burlington Industries, Inc., supra, at 754 (internal quotation marks omitted). The common law as codified in the Restatement (Second) of Agency (1957), provides a useful starting point fordefining this general common law. See Burlington Industries, Inc., supra, at 755 ("[T]he Restatement . . . is a usefulbeginning point for a discussion of general agency principles"); see also Meritor, supra, at 72. The Restatement ofAgency places strict limits on the extent to which an agent'smisconduct may be imputed to the principal for purposes ofawarding punitive damages:"Punitive damages can properly be awarded against amaster or other principal because of an act by an agentif, but only if:"(a) the principal authorized the doing and the manner of the act, or"(b) the agent was unfit and the principal was recklessin employing him, or"(c) the agent was employed in a managerial capacityand was acting in the scope of employment, or527US2 Unit: $U86 [05-02-01 17:54:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN543Cite as: 527 U. S. 526 (1999)Opinion of the Court"(d) the principal or a managerial agent of the princi-pal ratified or approved the act." Restatement (Second) of Agency, supra, $ 217 C.See also Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 909 (same).The Restatement, for example, provides that the principalmay be liable for punitive damages if it authorizes or ratifiesthe agent's tortious act, or if it acts recklessly in employingthe malfeasing agent. The Restatement also contemplatesliability for punitive awards where an employee serving ina "managerial capacity" committed the wrong while "actingin the scope of employment." Restatement (Second) ofAgency, supra, $ 217 C; see also Restatement (Second) ofTorts, supra, $ 909 (same). "Unfortunately, no good definition of what constitutes a `managerial capacity' has beenfound," 2 Ghiardi, Punitive Damages, $ 24.05, at 14, and determining whether an employee meets this description re-quires a fact-intensive inquiry,id., $ 24.05; 1 L. Schlueter &K. Redden, Punitive Damages, $ 4.4(B)(2)(a), p. 181 (3d ed.1995). "In making this determination, the court should re-view the type of authority that the employer has given tothe employee, the amount of discretion that the employeehas in what is done and how it is accomplished." Id.,$ 4.4(B)(2)(a), at 181. Suffice it to say here that the examplesprovided in the Restatement of Torts suggest that an employee must be "important," but perhaps need not be theemployer's "top management, officers, or directors," to beacting "in a managerial capacity." Ibid.; see also 2 Ghiardi,supra, $ 24.05, at 14; Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra,$ 909, at 468, Comment b and Illus. 3.Additional questions arise from the meaning of the "scopeof employment" requirement. The Restatement of Agencyprovides that even intentional torts are within the scope ofan agent's employment if the conduct is "the kind [the employee] is employed to perform," "occurs substantially withinthe authorized time and space limits," and "is actuated, atleast in part, by a purpose to serve the" employer. Restate527US2 Unit: $U86 [05-02-01 17:54:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN544 KOLSTAD v. AMERICAN DENTAL ASSN.Opinion of the Courtment (Second) of Agency, $ 228(1), at 504. According to theRestatement, so long as these rules are satisfied, an employee may be said to act within the scope of employmenteven if the employee engages in acts "specifically forbidden"by the employer and uses "forbidden means of accomplishingresults." Id., $ 230, at 511, Comment b; see also BurlingtonIndustries, Inc., 524 U. S., at 756; Keeton, Torts $ 70. Onthis view, even an employer who makes every effort to com-ply with Title VII would be held liable for the discriminatoryacts of agents acting in a "managerial capacity."Holding employers liable for punitive damages when theyengage in good faith efforts to comply with Title VII, however, is in some tension with the very principles underlyingcommon law limitations on vicarious liability for punitivedamages--that it is "improper ordinarily to award punitivedamages against one who himself is personally innocent andtherefore liable only vicariously." Restatement (Second) ofTorts, supra, $ 909, at 468, Comment b. Where an employerhas undertaken such good faith efforts at Title VII compliance, it "demonstrat[es] that it never acted in reckless disregard of federally protected rights." 139 F. 3d, at 974 (Tatel,J., dissenting); see also Harris, 132 F. 3d, at 983, 984 (observing that, "[i]n some cases, the existence of a written policyinstituted in good faith has operated as a total bar to employer liability for punitive damages" and concluding that"the institution of a written sexual harassment policy goes along way towards dispelling any claim about the employer's`reckless' or `malicious' state of mind").Applying the Restatement of Agency's "scope of employment" rule in the Title VII punitive damages context, moreover, would reduce the incentive for employers to implementantidiscrimination programs. In fact, such a rule wouldlikely exacerbate concerns among employers that $ 1981a's"malice" and "reckless indifference" standard penalizes thoseemployers who educate themselves and their employees onTitle VII's prohibitions.

S., at 806. With regard to sexual harassment, "[f]or example, Title VII is designed to encourage the creation of antiharassment policiesand effective grievance mechanisms." Burlington Industries, Inc., 524 U. S., at 764. The purposes underlying TitleVII are similarly advanced where employers are encouragedto adopt antidiscrimination policies and to educate their personnel on Title VII's prohibitions.In light of the perverse incentives that the Restatement's"scope of employment" rules create, we are compelled tomodify these principles to avoid undermining the objectivesunderlying Title VII. See generally ibid. See also Faragher, supra, at 802, n. 3 (noting that Court must "adaptagency concepts to the practical objectives of Title VII");Meritor Savings Bank, FSB, 477 U. S., at 72 ("[C]ommonlaw principles may not be transferable in all their particularsto Title VII"). Recognizing Title VII as an effort to promote prevention as well as remediation, and observing thevery principles underlying the Restatements' strict limits onvicarious liability for punitive damages, we agree that, in thepunitive damages context, an employer may not be vicariously liable for the discriminatory employment decisions ofmanagerial agents where these decisions are contrary to theemployer's "good-faith efforts to comply with Title VII."139 F. 3d, at 974 (Tatel, J., dissenting). As the dissent recognized, "[g]iving punitive damages protection to employers527US2 Unit: $U86 [05-02-01 17:54:39] PAGES PGT: OPIN546 KOLSTAD v. AMERICAN DENTAL ASSN.Opinion of the Courtwho make good-faith efforts to prevent discrimination in theworkplace accomplishes" Title VII's objective of "motivat[ing] employers to detect and deter Title VII violations."Ibid.We have concluded that an employer's conduct need not beindependently "egregious" to satisfy $ 1981a's requirementsfor a punitive damages award, although evidence of egregious misconduct may be used to meet the plaintiff 's burdenof proof. We leave for remand the question whether petitioner can identify facts sufficient to support an inferencethat the requisite mental state can be imputed to respondent.The parties have not yet had an opportunity to marshal therecord evidence in support of their views on the applicationof agency principles in the instant case, and the en banc majority had no reason to resolve the issue because it concludedthat petitioner had failed to demonstrate the requisite "egregious" misconduct. 139 F. 3d, at 968. Although trial testimony established that Allen made the ultimate decision topromote Spangler while serving as petitioner's interim executive director, respondent's highest position, Tr. 159 (Oct. 19,1995), it remains to be seen whether petitioner can make asufficient showing that Allen acted with malice or recklessindifference to petitioner's Title VII rights. Even if it couldbe established that Wheat effectively selected O'Donnell'sreplacement, moreover, several questions would remain, e. g.,whether Wheat was serving in a "managerial capacity" andwhether he behaved with malice or reckless indifference topetitioner's rights. It may also be necessary to determinewhether the Association had been making good faith effortsto enforce an antidiscrimination policy. We leave these issues for resolution on remand.For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.
