This is another in the long line of cases, beginning withMcCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), in which theFederal Government asks this Court for relief from what itconsiders illegal state taxes. Unlike the typical tax immu-nity case, however, we are not presented with a claim thatthe state tax is unconstitutional; instead, the question iswhether the Federal Government may recover taxes itclaims were wrongfully assessed under California lawagainst one of the Government's private contractors.IThe United States has established three Naval PetroleumReserves in California and Wyoming, one of which is NavalPetroleum Reserve No. 1, located in Kern County, Califor-nia. 10 U. S. C. $ 7420. First through the Department ofthe Navy and later through the Department of Energy, theUnited States contracted with Williams Brothers Engineering Company (WBEC) to manage oil drilling operations atReserve No. 1 from 1975 to 1985. Under the contract,WBEC received an annual fixed fee plus reimbursement forcosts, which the contract defined to include state sales anduse taxes.California assessed approximately $14 million in sales anduse taxes, pursuant to Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Ann. $ 6384(West 1987), against WBEC for the years 1975 through 1981.Illinois, Bonnie J. Campbell of Iowa, Richard P. Ieyoub of Louisiana, J.Joseph Curran, Jr., of Maryland, Frank J.

S. 746 (1993)Opinion of the CourtThe State informed WBEC of the tax deficiencies throughtwo notices, one issued in July 1978 and the other in December 1982. WBEC, at the direction of the United States, ap-plied to the California Board of Equalization for administrative redetermination of the assessments, see $ 6932. WBECargued that the State had misapplied its own law, taxingproperty that was outside the scope of $ 6384. The Boardof Equalization denied each claim, with minor exceptions.Thereafter, WBEC paid the assessments under protest,using funds the Federal Government provided. It then filedtimely actions in state court. In January 1988, the Stateand WBEC stipulated to a $3 million refund, for erroneousassessments on property that WBEC had purchased and thatGovernment personnel had installed, and to dismissal of bothactions without prejudice. The remaining $11 million resulted from assessments on property that WBEC had purchased and that private subcontractors, managed by WBEC,had installed.In May 1988, the United States filed suit in the EasternDistrict of California, seeking a declaratory judgment thatCalifornia had classified and taxed WBEC erroneously underCalifornia law and that the taxed property actually was exempt. It sought a refund of the $11 million plus interest.In the course of the suit, the United States argued it wasentitled to recovery based on the federal common-law causeof action for money had and received. The District Courtrejected both grounds for recovery and granted summaryjudgment for the State.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 932F. 2d 1346 (1991). The court began by noting that the Government did not claim that either it or WBEC was constitutionally immune from the tax, an argument this Court rejected in United States v. New Mexico, 455 U. S. 720 (1982).932 F. 2d, at 1347-1348. Because the United States lacked"a colorable constitutional challenge," id., at 1349, the Courtof Appeals looked to whether federal common law might pro507us3$61J 11-26-96 17:11:13 PAGES OPINPGT750 UNITED STATES v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtvide a cause of action. It declined to accept the Government's argument that the simple act of disbursing federalfunds was a "constitutional function" that created a federalinterest in conflict with state law. The Government haddone no more than pay state taxes pursuant to state law;this did not rise to the level of a federal interest requiringthe application of federal law. Ibid. The Court of Appealsthen held that the Government could not maintain a quasicontract cause of action because the facts did not support aclaim of unjust enrichment. Among other things, "WBEC,backed throughout by the United States, had a fair chanceto argue against the validity of the assessments in the administrative and state court proceedings." Id., at 1350. Finally, the Court of Appeals relied on the fact that the Government's quasi-contract argument was "posited upon theinterpretation of a state-created exemption from a state[]-created sales tax." Ibid. The court found that the State'sclaim filing requirements, including that a court action befiled within 90 days of an administrative denial, were conditions precedent to a cause of action for a tax refund. Id., at1350-1351. The Government had failed to satisfy the conditions; therefore, the Court of Appeals held, the Governmenthad no state cause of action and no quasi-contract action."Since federal statutes of limitations become determinativeonly after the government acquires a cause of action, andsince the United States never acquired a cause of action,"the court reasoned, the 6-year statute of limitations of "28U. S. C. $ 2415 does not apply." Id., at 1351.The Court of Appeals acknowledged that the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in a factually similar case,recently had reached the opposite conclusion. Id., at 1351-1352. In United States v. Broward County, 901 F. 2d 1005(1990), the Eleventh Circuit rejected the argument on whichthe Ninth Circuit relied and held that the Government hada "federal common law cause of action in quasi-contract for507us3$61J 11-26-96 17:11:13 PAGES OPINPGT751Cite as: 507 U. S. 746 (1993)Opinion of the Courtmoney had and received." Id., at 1008-1009. We grantedcertiorari to resolve the conflict. 506 U. S. 813 (1992).IIThe Government concedes that it could have intervened inWBEC's administrative and state-court proceedings. Tr. ofOral Arg. 17. But it argues that whether it complied withstate procedural requirements or whether it could have intervened is irrelevant, because it has a federal right to re-cover the taxes under the federal common-law cause of action for money had and received (also known as indebitatusassumpsit). Prior to the creation of federal administrativeand statutory remedies for the recovery of federal taxes, thisCourt held that a taxpayer could bring an action for moneyhad and received to recover erroneously or illegally assessedtaxes. In City of Philadelphia v. The Collector, 5 Wall. 720(1867), the Court stated:"[The] [a]ppropriate remedy to recover back moneypaid [to federal tax collectors] under protest on accountof duties or taxes erroneously or illegally assessed, is anaction of assumpsit for money had and received. Wherethe party voluntarily pays the money, he is without rem-edy; but if he pays it by compulsion of law, or underprotest, or with notice that he intends to bring suit totest the validity of the claim, he may recover it back, ifthe assessment was erroneous or illegal, in an action ofassumpsit for money had and received."Id., at 731-732(citing Elliott v. Swartwout, 10 Pet. 137, 150 (1836)).The Government reasons that it paid WBEC's taxes, that thetaxes were wrongfully assessed, and that therefore it mayrecover the funds used to pay those taxes. Since an actionfor money had and received is based on a contract implied inlaw, see Bayne v. United States, 93 U. S. 642, 643 (1877), theGovernment further reasons that its claims are governed bythe 6-year statute of limitations in 28 U. S. C. $ 2415(a), andnot the 90-day limitation period in the California Code.507us3$61J 11-26-96 17:11:13 PAGES OPINPGT752 UNITED STATES v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the CourtThe taxpayers in both City of Philadelphia and the caseon which it relies,Elliott v. Swartwout, were attempting torecover money they had paid under protest to the federaltax collector in settlement of tax assessments erroneouslymade against them. In this case, by contrast, the taxpayer--WBEC--has had its day in court and gone home.The Government attempts to recover money it paid in reimbursement for state tax assessments against the contractor,even though the contractor already has challenged the assessment and accepted a resolution of its claims. The Gov-ernment contends that, because its contract with WBECinvolved an advanced funding arrangement, the Governmentwas the one that actually paid the state taxes. Because thedisbursement of federal funds is involved, the Governmentasserts, the federal action for money had and received is appropriate. Even assuming that federal courts may entertain a federal common-law action for the recovery of statetaxes paid by the Government, we conclude that a federalaction is inappropriate here because the Government is in nobetter position than as a subrogee of its contractor WBEC.The management contract between the Government andWBEC is in all relevant respects identical to the contractswe discussed in United States v. New Mexico, 455 U. S. 720(1982). There, as here, the State had imposed sales and usetaxes on private contractors managing Department of Energy sites. Like WBEC, two of the contractors receivedcosts plus a fixed fee. Id., at 723-724. Like WBEC's contracts, the contracts provided that title to all tangible personal property passed directly from the vendor to the Government. Id., at 724. "Finally, and most importantly, thecontracts use[d] a so-called `advanced funding' procedure tomeet contractor costs." Id., at 725. The contractors paidcreditors and employees with drafts drawn on a special bankaccount in which the Government deposited funds, so thatonly federal funds were expended when the contractorsmade purchases. Id., at 726. Cf. App. 142-143 (Declaration507us3$61J 11-26-96 17:11:13 PAGES OPINPGT753Cite as: 507 U. S. 746 (1993)Opinion of the Courtof Kenneth Meeks in Support of United States' Motion forSummary Judgment, describing similar funding operationswith WBEC).InNew Mexico, the Government brought an action arguing that the contractors' expenditures, other than thosemade out of the fixed fees, were constitutionally immunefrom taxation. We noted that the doctrine of federal immunity from state taxation is "one that has been marked fromthe beginning by inconsistent decisions and excessively delicate distinctions." 455 U. S., at 730. After surveying our"confusing" precedents, we concluded it was time to returnto the underlying constitutional principle of tax immunity: AState may not lay a tax " `directly upon the United States.' "Id., at 733 (quoting Mayo v. United States, 319 U. S. 441, 447(1943)). But whereas the Government is absolutely immunefrom direct taxes, it is not immune from taxes merely because they have an "effect" on it, or "even because the Federal Government shoulders the entire economic burden ofthe levy." 455 U. S., at 734. In fact, it is "constitutionallyirrelevant that the United States reimburse[s] all the contractor's expenditures, including those going to meet thetax." Ibid. (citing Alabama v. King & Boozer, 314 U. S. 1(1941)). Tax immunity is "appropriate in only one circumstance: when the levy falls on the United States itself, oron an agency or instrumentality so closely connected to theGovernment that the two cannot realistically be viewed asseparate entities." 455 U. S., at 735.It is beyond peradventure that California did not tax--indeed, could not have taxed--the Federal Government inthis case. California taxed WBEC. And the Government'svoluntary agreement to reimburse (or even fund in advance)WBEC for those taxes does not make the Government's payments direct disbursements of federal funds to the State.We addressed an analogous indemnification relationship inBrady v. Roosevelt S. S. Co., 317 U. S. 575 (1943). TheUnited States had contracted with a private corporation to507us3$61J 11-26-96 17:11:13 PAGES OPINPGT754 UNITED STATES v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtoperate a Maritime Commission vessel. A customs inspec-tor suffered injuries on the vessel that led to his death, andhis widow brought a maritime tort action against the privatecorporation. In defense, respondent contended "that if thejudgment against [it] stands, the United States ultimatelywill have to pay it by reason of provisions of the contractbetween respondent and the [Maritime] Commission. It istherefore urged that the United States is the real party ininterest."Id., at 582. We rejected respondent's argumentthat petitioner could be deprived of her cause of action byreason of the contract. "Immunity from suit on a cause ofaction which the law creates cannot be so readily obtained."Id., at 583. Absent congressional action, we would not allow"concessions made by contracting officers of the government" to make such a "basic alteration" in the law. Id., at584.We conclude from Brady and New Mexico that the Government cannot use the existence of an obligation to indemnifyWBEC to create a federal cause of action for money had andreceived to recover state taxes paid by WBEC any morethan the Roosevelt Steamship Company could use the existence of a right to indemnity from the Government to defeata claim for recovery. See Brady, supra, at 584. Cf. Faridv. Smith, 850 F. 2d 917, 923 (CA2 1988) (a State's decisionto indemnify its public servants does not confer EleventhAmendment immunity on state officials sued in their personal capacity).Although the Government does not cite Brady, it does citetwo other cases that suggest the lesson of Brady might notapply in an action for money had and received. Accordingto the Government, Bayne v. United States, 93 U. S. 642(1877), and Gaines v. Miller, 111 U. S. 395 (1884), stand forthe proposition that an action for money had and receivedmay "be employed by the United States to recover moneyfrom a third party who received federal funds that had beenmisappropriated by a government agent." Brief for United507us3$61J 11-26-96 17:11:13 PAGES OPINPGT755Cite as: 507 U. S. 746 (1993)Opinion of the CourtStates 14. We find these cases inapposite. In Bayne, anArmy paymaster withdrew money from the paymaster'sbank account, endorsed the checks in blank, and sent themto Merchants' Bank with instructions to credit the accountof Bayne & Co. The Court affirmed the Government's judgment against Bayne & Co. under an action for money hadand received. 93 U. S., at 643. InGaines, the agent of anestate's executors sold estate property and illegally kept aportion of the money. 111 U. S., at 396. Many years later,the agent had died, but Gaines, the legatee of the first estate,brought an action in equity against the administrator of theagent's estate. The Court affirmed the lower court's judgment against Gaines because, among other reasons, she hadan adequate remedy at law: an action for money had andreceived. Id., at 397-398.Bayne and Gaines share two features this case lacks. Thefirst is that, in each, the rightful owner of the money lost itby way of theft. That is, the money passed from the firstparty to the second party unlawfully. See Bayne, supra, at643; Gaines, supra, at 396. The second feature is that inboth cases the rightful owner of the money sued a thirdparty who had a relationship that, at least for our purposes,made that party legally responsible for the actions of the onewho unlawfully took the money. The Court was satisfied inBayne that the transactions between the paymaster, thebanks, and Bayne & Co. were "the result of a fraudulentpurpose to secure the use of the public money to Bayne &Co., who received it with full knowledge that it belonged tothe United States, and had been applied in manifest violationof the act of Congress." 93 U. S., at 643. In other words,Bayne & Co. and the paymaster were accomplices, each liablefor the acts of the other. Cf. 18 U. S. C. $ 2. In Gaines,petitioner sued the administrator of the agent's estate, whowas legally responsible for paying the agent's debts out ofthe estate. See, e. g., 2 J. Perkins, Law of Executors andAdministrators 988-990 (6th Am. ed. 1877).507us3$61J 11-26-96 17:11:13 PAGES OPINPGT756 UNITED STATES v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the CourtThe Government does not contend that WBEC stole themoney at issue in this case or otherwise took money fromthe Government unlawfully. WBEC did not. Nor does theGovernment contend that California and WBEC had a relationship that would make California liable for WBEC's actions. They did not. In fact, California and WBEC had anadverse relationship: that of creditor and debtor. California's demand that WBEC pay what California believed to bea lawful debt does not make California legally responsiblefor the Government's indemnification of WBEC. In thesecircumstances, we do not imply a contract in law betweenCalifornia and the Government. Without an implied contract, an action for money had and received will not lieagainst the State.Although the Government cannot proceed in an action formoney had and received, our discussion of indemnificationsuggests the Government may not be without recourse: Because it indemnified the contractor, the Government has aright to be subrogated to the contractor's claims against theState. See 10 W. Jaeger, Williston on Contracts $ 1265 (3ded. 1967); Brief for Respondents 13 (conceding the same).When proceeding by subrogation, the subrogee "stands inthe place of one whose claim he has paid." United States v.Munsey Trust Co., 332 U. S. 234, 242 (1947). Here WBEC'srights have lapsed and its claims are barred. Under traditional subrogation principles then, the claims of the UnitedStates also would be barred. The subrogee, who has all therights of the subrogor, usually "cannot acquire by subrogation what another whose rights he claims did not have."Ibid. Although WBEC filed actions in state court within 90days of the Board of Equalization's administrative decisions,WBEC later dismissed those cases without prejudice. Adismissal without prejudice terminates the action and "concludes the rights of the parties in that particular action."Gagnon Co. v. Nevada Desert Inn, 45 Cal. 2d 448, 455, 289 P.2d 466, 472 (1955). A subrogee could have proceeded only507us3$61J 11-26-96 17:11:13 PAGES OPINPGT757Cite as: 507 U. S. 746 (1993)Opinion of the Courtif WBEC could have filed a new state-court action at thattime, which it could not do.The traditional rules of subrogation, however, do not nec-essarily apply to the Government. But cf.United States v.Standard Oil Co. of Cal., 332 U. S. 301, 309 (1947) (suggestingthat state law controls "where the Government has simplysubstituted itself for others as successor to rights governedby state law"). The Government argues strenuously that,at the very least, state statutes of limitations do not bindit. It cites three cases to support this position. See UnitedStates v. Summerlin, 310 U. S. 414, 416 (1940); Board ofComm'rs of Jackson County v. United States, 308 U. S. 343,351 (1939);United States v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins.Co., 364 U. S. 301, 308 (1960). In the cases the Governmentcites, however, either the right at issue was obtained by theGovernment through, or created by, a federal statute, seeSummerlin, supra, at 416 (United States suing under claimreceived by assignment pursuant to Act of June 27, 1934, 48Stat. 1246); Board of Comm'rs, supra, at 349-350 (UnitedStates suing as Indian trustee pursuant to congressionalstatute); or a federal statute provided the statute of limi-tations, seeJohn Hancock, supra, at 301 (United Statesredeeming mortgage foreclosure pursuant to statute of limitations in 28 U. S. C. $ 2410(c)). Moreover, in each case,the Government was proceeding in its sovereign capacity.As the Government rightly notes:"When the United States becomes entitled to a claim,acting in its governmental capacity, and asserts its claimin that right, it cannot be deemed to have abdicated itsgovernmental authority so as to become subject to astate statute putting a time limit upon enforcement."Summerlin, supra, at 417.In contrast, the Government here became entitled to itsclaim by indemnifying a private contractor's state-law debt.It can assert its claim only by way of subrogation, an equita507us3$61J 11-26-96 17:11:13 PAGES OPINPGT758 UNITED STATES v. CALIFORNIAOpinion of the Courtble action created by the courts. Summerlin is clearlydistinguishable.Whether in general a state-law action brought by theUnited States is subject to a federal or state statute of limitations is a difficult question. We need not resolve it today,however, because Guaranty Trust Co. v. United States, 304U. S. 126 (1938), provides guidance in this case. There theUnited States was proceeding as the assignee of the SovietGovernment and sought to collect under state law. Thepetitioner argued that the statute of limitations had run, andthe United States asserted, among other defenses, that itwas not bound by state statutes of limitations. We foundthat the circumstances of the case "admit[ted] of no appealto such a policy." Id., at 141. Even if the United Stateshad a right to be free from the statute of limitations, it wasdeprived of no right on those facts. "[F]or the proof demonstrate[d] that the United States never acquired a right freeof a pre-existing infirmity, the running of limitations againstits assignor, which public policy does not forbid." Id., at142.Here, although the Government acquired a right to subrogation to WBEC's claims upon payment of the taxes, theGovernment did not assert that right until it filed the federaljudicial proceeding. As the California Supreme Court hasheld: " `[A] surety by payment does not become ipso factosubrogated to the rights of the creditor, but only acquires aright to such subrogation, and . . . before the substitution orequitable assignment can actually take place he must actively assert his equitable right thereto. It is not a substantive tangible right of such nature and character that it canbe seized and held and enjoyed independently of a judicialproceeding.' " Offer v. Superior Court of San Francisco,194 Cal. 114, 117, 228 P. 11, 12 (1924) (quoting 25 Ruling CaseLaw 1391 (1919)). Accord, 10 Jaeger, Williston on Contracts$ 1265, at 848, and n. 9 (citing cases). Because the Government waited until after the state statute of limitations had507us3$61J 11-26-96 17:11:13 PAGES OPINPGT759Cite as: 507 U. S. 746 (1993)Opinion of the Courtrun against WBEC to bring suit, the Government was notsubrogated to "a right free of a pre-existing infirmity."Guaranty Trust, supra, at 142. That the doctrine of subro-gation is one of equity only strengthens our conclusion thatthe Government may not proceed: The Government waited10 years after the first notice of deficiency was issued, 8years after the second notice was issued, and almost 6 yearsafter the state statute of limitations ran to bring this suit.The Government argues that affirming the Court of Ap-peals often will leave it "without an effective remedy to contest a tax improperly exacted from a federal contractor" andsubject it to the "vagaries" of 50 state tax-law procedures.Brief for United States 26-27. But federal contractorsalready are subject to the substantive tax laws of the 50States. Nothing in our decision prevents the Governmentfrom including in its contracts a requirement that its contractors be responsible for all taxes the Government believes arewrongfully assessed, a contract term that likely would remove any disinterest a contractor may have toward litigatingin state court. If our decision today results in an intolerabledrain on the public fisc, Congress, which can take into ac-count the concerns of the States as well as the Federal Government, is free to address the situation. See New Mexico,455 U. S., at 737-738.IIIIn United States v. New Mexico, we held that the FederalGovernment is immune only from state taxes imposed on itdirectly. Id., at 734. In so holding, we hoped to "forestall,at least to a degree, some of the manipulation and woodenformalism that occasionally have marked tax litigation--andthat have no proper place in determining the allocation ofpower between coexisting sovereignties." Id., at 737.Today we hold that shouldering the "entire economic burdenof the levy," id., at 734, through indemnification does not givethe Federal Government a federal common-law cause of action for money had and received to challenge a state tax on507us3$61J 11-26-96 17:11:13 PAGES OPINPGT760 UNITED STATES v.

Todo otherwise would be to return to the "manipulation andwooden formalism" we put aside in New Mexico.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
