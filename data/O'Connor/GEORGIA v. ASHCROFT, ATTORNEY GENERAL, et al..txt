S. C. $ 1973c.Whether a voting procedure change should be precleared depends on whether the change "would lead to a retrogressionin the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise." Beer v. UnitedStates, 425 U. S. 130, 141 (1976). We therefore must decidewhether Georgia's State Senate redistricting plan is retrogressive as compared to its previous, benchmark districtingplan.IAOver the past decade, the propriety of Georgia's state andcongressional districts has been the subject of repeated litigation. In 1991, the Georgia General Assembly began theprocess of redistricting after the 1990 census. BecauseGeorgia is a covered jurisdiction under $ 5 of the VotingRights Act, see Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 905 (1995),Georgia submitted its revised State Senate plan to theUnited States Department of Justice for preclearance. Theplan as enacted into law increased the number of majorityminority districts from the previous Senate plan. TheDepartment of Justice nevertheless refused preclearancebecause of Georgia's failure to maximize the number ofmajority-minority districts. See Johnson v. Miller, 929F. Supp. 1529, 1537, and n. 23 (SD Ga. 1996). After Georgiamade changes to the Senate plan in an attempt to satisfy theUnited States' objections, the State again submitted it to theDepartment of Justice for preclearance. Again, the Department of Justice refused preclearance because the plan did notcontain a sufficient number of majority-minority districts.See id., at 1537, 1539. Finally, the United States precleared539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN467Cite as: 539 U. S. 461 (2003)Opinion of the CourtGeorgia's third redistricting plan, approving it in the springof 1992. Seeid., at 1537.Georgia's 1992 Senate plan was not challenged in court.Seeid., at 1533-1534. Its congressional districting plan,however, was challenged as unconstitutional under the EqualProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. SeeShaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630 (1993). In 1995, we held inMiller v. Johnson that Georgia's congressional districtingplan was unconstitutional because it engaged in "the veryracial stereotyping the Fourteenth Amendment forbids" bymaking race the "predominant, overriding factor explaining"Georgia's congressional districting decisions. 515 U. S., at928, 920. And even though it was "safe to say that the congressional plan enacted in the end was required in order toobtain preclearance," this justification did not permit Georgia to engage in racial gerrymandering. See id., at 921.Georgia's State Senate districts served as "building blocks"to create the congressional districting plan found unconstitutional in Miller v. Johnson. Johnson v. Miller, 929 F. Supp.,at 1533, n. 8 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also id.,at 1536.Georgia recognized that after Miller v. Johnson, its legislative districts were unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause. See 929 F. Supp., at 1533, 1540. Accordingly, Georgia attempted to cure the perceived constitutionalproblems with the 1992 State Senate districting plan bypassing another plan in 1995. The Department of Justicerefused to preclear the 1995 plan, maintaining that it retrogressed from the 1992 plan and that Miller v. Johnson concerned only Georgia's congressional districts, not Georgia'sState Senate districts. See 929 F. Supp., at 1540-1541.Private litigants subsequently brought an action challenging the constitutionality of the 1995 Senate plan. See id., at1533. The three-judge panel of the District Court reviewingthe 1995 Senate plan found that "[i]t is clear that a blackmaximization policy had become an integral part of the sec539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN468 GEORGIA v.

The net effect of the DOJ'spreclearance objection[s] . . . was to require the State ofGeorgia to increase the number of majority black districtsin its redistricting plans, which were already ameliorativeplans, beyond any reasonable concept of non-retrogression."Id., at 1539-1540. The court noted that in Miller v. Johnson, we specifically disapproved of the Department of Jus-tice's policy that the maximization of black districts was apart of the $ 5 retrogression analysis. See 929 F. Supp., at1539. Indeed, inMiller, we found that the Department ofJustice's objections to Georgia's redistricting plans were"driven by its policy of maximizing majority-black districts."515 U. S., at 924. And "[i]n utilizing $ 5 to require Statesto create majority-minority districts wherever possible, theDepartment of Justice expanded its authority under the statute beyond what Congress intended and we have upheld."Id., at 925.The District Court stated that the maximization ofmajority-minority districts in Georgia "artificially push[ed]the percentage of black voters within some majority blackdistricts as high as possible." 929 F. Supp., at 1536. Theplan that eventually received the Department of Justice'spreclearance in 1992 "represented the General Assembly'ssurrender to the black maximization policy of the DOJ." Id.,at 1540. The court then found that the 1995 plan was anunconstitutional racial gerrymander. See id., at 1543.Under court direction, Georgia and the Department of Justice reached a mediated agreement on the constitutionalityof the 1995 Senate plan. Georgia passed a new plan in 1997,and the Department of Justice quickly precleared it. Theredrawn map resembled to a large degree the 1992 plan thateventually received preclearance from the Department ofJustice, with some changes to accommodate the decision ofthis Court in Miller v. Johnson, and of the District Court inJohnson v. Miller.539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN469Cite as: 539 U. S. 461 (2003)Opinion of the CourtAll parties here concede that the 1997 plan is the bench-mark plan for this litigation because it was in effect at thetime of the 2001 redistricting effort. The 1997 plan drew 56districts, 11 of them with a total black population of over50%, and 10 of them with a black voting age population ofover 50%. See Record, Doc. No. 148, Pl. Exh. 1C (hereinafter Pl. Exh.). The 2000 census revealed that these numbers had increased so that 13 districts had a black populationof at least 50%, with the black voting age population exceeding 50% in 12 of those districts. See 195 F. Supp. 2d 25, 39(DC 2002).After the 2000 census, the Georgia General Assemblybegan the process of redistricting the Senate once again.No party contests that a substantial majority of black votersin Georgia vote Democratic, or that all elected black representatives in the General Assembly are Democrats. Thegoal of the Democratic leadership--black and white--was tomaintain the number of majority-minority districts and alsoincrease the number of Democratic Senate seats. See id., at41-42. For example, the Director of Georgia's LegislativeRedistricting Office, Linda Meggers, testified that the SenateBlack Caucus " `wanted to maintain' " the existing majorityminority districts and at the same time " `not waste' " votes.Id., at 41.The Vice Chairman of the Senate Reapportionment Committee, Senator Robert Brown, also testified about the goalsof the redistricting effort. Senator Brown, who is black,chaired the subcommittee that developed the Senate plan atissue here. See id., at 42. Senator Brown believed whenhe designed the Senate plan that as the black voting agepopulation in a district increased beyond what was necessary, it would "pus[h] the whole thing more towards [the]Republican[s]." Pl. Exh. 20, at 24. And "correspondingly,"Senator Brown stated, "the more you diminish the power ofAfrican-Americans overall." Ibid. Senator Charles Walker was the majority leader of the Senate. Senator Walker539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN470 GEORGIA v. ASHCROFTOpinion of the Courttestified that it was important to attempt to maintain aDemocratic majority in the Senate because "we [AfricanAmericans] have a better chance to participate in the politi-cal process under the Democratic majority than we wouldhave under a Republican majority." Pl. Exh. 24, at 19. Atleast 7 of the 11 black members of the Senate could chaircommittees. See 195 F. Supp. 2d, at 41.The plan as designed by Senator Brown's committee kepttrue to the dual goals of maintaining at least as manymajority-minority districts while also attempting to increaseDemocratic strength in the Senate. Part of the Democrats'strategy was not only to maintain the number of majorityminority districts, but to increase the number of so-called"influence" districts, where black voters would be able toexert a significant--if not decisive--force in the electionprocess. As the majority leader testified, "in the past, youknow, what we would end up doing was packing. You putall blacks in one district and all whites in one district, sowhat you end up with is [a] black Democratic district and[a] white Republican district. That's not a good strategy.That does not bring the people together, it divides the population. But if you put people together on voting precincts itbrings people together." Pl. Exh. 24, at 19.The plan as designed by the Senate "unpacked" the mostheavily concentrated majority-minority districts in thebenchmark plan, and created a number of new influence districts. The new plan drew 13 districts with a majority-blackvoting age population, 13 additional districts with a blackvoting age population of between 30% and 50%, and 4 otherdistricts with a black voting age population of between 25%and 30%. See Pl. Exh. 2C. According to the 2000 census,as compared to the benchmark plan, the new plan reducedby five the number of districts with a black voting age population in excess of 60%. Compare Pl. Exh. 1D with Pl. Exh.2C. Yet it increased the number of majority-black votingage population districts by one, and it increased the number539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN471Cite as: 539 U. S. 461 (2003)Opinion of the Courtof districts with a black voting age population of between25% and 50% by four. As compared to the benchmark planenacted in 1997, the difference is even larger. Under theold census figures, Georgia had 10 Senate districts with amajority-black voting age population, and 8 Senate districtswith a black voting age population of between 30% and 50%.See Pl. Exh. 1C. The new plan thus increased the numberof districts with a majority black voting age population bythree, and increased the number of districts with a blackvoting age population of between 30% and 50% by anotherfive. Compare Pl. Exh. 1C with Pl. Exh. 2C.The Senate adopted its new districting plan on August 10,2001, by a vote of 29 to 26. Ten of the eleven black Senatorsvoted for the plan. 195 F. Supp. 2d, at 55. The GeorgiaHouse of Representatives passed the Senate plan by a voteof 101 to 71. Thirty-three of the thirty-four black Representatives voted for the plan. Ibid. No Republican ineither the House or the Senate voted for the plan, makingthe votes of the black legislators necessary for passage. Seeid., at 41. The Governor signed the Senate plan into law onAugust 24, 2001, and Georgia subsequently sought to obtainpreclearance.BPursuant to $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act, a covered juris-diction like Georgia has the option of either seeking administrative preclearance through the Attorney General of theUnited States or seeking judicial preclearance by institutingan action in the United States District Court for the Districtof Columbia for a declaratory judgment that the votingchange comports with $ 5. 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c; Georgia v.United States, 411 U. S. 526 (1973). Georgia chose the lattermethod, filing suit seeking a declaratory judgment that theState Senate plan does not violate $ 5.Georgia, which bears the burden of proof in this action,see Pleasant Grove v. United States, 479 U. S. 462 (1987),attempted to prove that its Senate plan was not retrogres539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN472 GEORGIA v. ASHCROFTOpinion of the Courtsive either in intent or in effect. It submitted detailed evi-dence documenting in each district the total population, thetotal black population, the black voting age population, thepercentage of black registered voters, and the overall percentage of Democratic votes (i. e., the overall likelihood thatvoters in a particular district will vote Democratic), amongother things. See 195 F. Supp. 2d, at 36; see also Pl. Exhs.2C, 2D. The State also submitted evidence about how eachof these statistics compared to the benchmark districts. See195 F. Supp. 2d, at 36; see also Pl. Exhs. 1C, 1D, 1E (revised).Georgia also submitted testimony from numerous peoplewho had participated in enacting the Senate plan into law,and from United States Congressman John Lewis, who represents the Atlanta area. These witnesses testified that thenew Senate plan was designed to increase black votingstrength throughout the State as well as to help ensure acontinued Democratic majority in the Senate. The Statealso submitted expert testimony that African-American andnon-African-American voters have equal chances of electingtheir preferred candidate when the black voting age population of a district is at 44.3%. Finally, in response to objections raised by the United States, Georgia submitted moredetailed statistical evidence with respect to three proposedSenate districts that the United States found objectionable--Districts 2, 12, and 26--and two districts that the intervenors challenged--Districts 15 and 22.The United States, through the Attorney General, arguedin District Court that Georgia's 2001 Senate redistrictingplan should not be precleared. It argued that the plan'schanges to the boundaries of Districts 2, 12, and 26 unlawfully reduced the ability of black voters to elect candidatesof their choice. See Brief for Federal Appellees 8; 195F. Supp. 2d, at 72. The United States noted that in District2, the black voting age population dropped from 60.58% to50.31%; in District 12, the black voting age populationdropped from 55.43% to 50.66%; and in District 26, the black539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN473Cite as: 539 U. S. 461 (2003)Opinion of the Courtvoting age population dropped from 62.45% to 50.80%.1Moreover, in all three of these districts, the percentage ofblack registered voters dropped to just under 50%. TheUnited States also submitted expert evidence that voting isracially polarized in Senate Districts 2, 12, and 26. See id.,at 69-71. The United States acknowledged that some limited percentage of whites would vote for a black candidate,but maintained that the percentage was not sufficient forblack voters to elect their candidate of choice. See id., at70-71. The United States also offered testimony from various witnesses, including lay witnesses living in the three dis-tricts, who asserted that the new contours of Districts 2, 12,and 26 would reduce the opportunity for blacks to elect acandidate of their choice in those districts; Senator ReginaThomas of District 2, the only black Senator who votedagainst the plan; Senator Eric Johnson, the Republicanleader of the Senate; and some black legislators who voted1 Georgia and the United States have submitted slightly different figuresregarding the black voting age population of each district. The differingfigures depend upon whether the total number of blacks includes thosepeople who self-identify as both black and a member of another minoritygroup, such as Hispanic. Georgia counts this group of people, while theUnited States does not do so. Like the District Court, we consider all therecord information, "including total black population, black registrationnumbers and both [black voting age population] numbers." 195 F. Supp.2d 25, 79 (DC 2002). We focus in particular on Georgia's black voting agepopulation numbers in this case because all parties rely on them to someextent and because Georgia used its own black voting age population numbers when it enacted the Senate plan. Moreover, the United States doesnot count all persons who identify themselves as black. It counts thosewho say they are black and those who say that they are both black andwhite, but it does not count those who say they are both black and amember of another minority group. Using the United States' numbersmay have more relevance if the case involves a comparison of differentminority groups. Cf. Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. 997 (1994); Bush v.Vera, 517 U. S. 952 (1996). Here, however, the case involves an examination of only one minority group's effective exercise of the electoral franchise. In such circumstances, we believe it is proper to look at all individuals who identify themselves as black.539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN474 GEORGIA v.

As the District Court stated,"the United States' evidence was extremely limited inscope--focusing only on three contested districts in the StateSenate plan. That evidence was not designed to permit thecourt to assess the overall impact of [the Senate plan]." 195F. Supp. 2d, at 37.Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24, the District Court also permitted four African-American citizens ofGeorgia to intervene. The intervenors identified two otherdistricts--Districts 15 and 22--where they alleged retrogression had occurred. The intervenors "present[ed] littleevidence other than proposed alternative plans and an expert report critiquing the State's expert report." 195 F.Supp. 2d, at 37.A three-judge panel of the District Court held that Georgia's State Senate apportionment violated $ 5, and was therefore not entitled to preclearance. See id., at 97. Judge Sullivan, joined by Judge Edwards, concluded that Georgia had"not demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence thatthe State Senate redistricting plan would not have a retrogressive effect on African American voters" effective exercise of the electoral franchise. Ibid. The court found thatSenate Districts 2, 12, and 26 were retrogressive becausein each district, a lesser opportunity existed for the blackcandidate of choice to win election under the new plan thanunder the benchmark plan. See id., at 93-94. The courtfound that the reductions in black voting age population inDistricts 2, 12, and 26 would "diminish African Americanvoting strength in these districts," and that Georgia had"failed to present any . . . evidence" that the retrogressionin those districts "will be offset by gains in other districts."Id., at 88.539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN475Cite as: 539 U.

Hetherefore rejected Georgia's argument that a plan preserving an equal opportunity for minorities to elect candidates oftheir choice satisfies $ 5. Judge Edwards also rejected thetestimony of the black Georgia politicians who supported theSenate plan. In his view, the testimony did not addresswhether racial polarization was occurring in Senate Districts2, 12, and 26. See id., at 101-102.Judge Oberdorfer dissented. He would have g iven"greater credence to the political expertise and motivation ofGeorgia's African-American political leaders and reasonableinferences drawn from their testimony and the voting dataand statistics." Id., at 102. He noted that this Court hasnot answered "whether a redistricting plan that preservesor increases the number of districts statewide in which minorities have a fair or reasonable opportunity to elect candidates of choice is entitled to preclearance, or whether everydistrict must remain at or improve on the benchmark probability of victory, even if doing so maintains a minority supermajority far in excess of the level needed for effective exercise of [the] electoral franchise." Id., at 117.After the District Court refused to preclear the plan,Georgia enacted another plan, largely similar to the one atissue here, except that it added black voters to Districts 2,12, and 26. The District Court precleared this plan. See204 F. Supp. 2d 4 (2002). No party has contested the propriety of the District Court's preclearance of the Senate plan asamended. Georgia asserts that it will use the plan as originally enacted if it receives preclearance.We noted probable jurisdiction to consider whether theDistrict Court should have precleared the plan as originallyenacted by Georgia in 2001, 537 U. S. 1151 (2003), and nowvacate the judgment below.539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN476 GEORGIA v. ASHCROFTOpinion of the CourtIIBefore addressing the merits of Georgia's preclearanceclaim, we address the State's argument that the DistrictCourt was incorrect in allowing the private litigants to inter-vene in this lawsuit. Georgia maintains that private partiesshould not be allowed to intervene in $ 5 actions becauseStates should not be subjected to the political stratagems ofintervenors. While the United States disagrees with Geor-gia on the propriety of intervention here, the United Statesargues that this question is moot because the participationof the intervenors did not affect the District Court's rulingon the merits and the intervenors did not appeal the court'sruling.We do not think Georgia's argument is moot. The inter-venors did not have to appeal because they were prevailingparties below. Moreover, the District Court addressed theevidence that the intervenors submitted, which is now infront of this Court. The issue whether intervenors areproper parties still has relevance in this Court because theyargue here that the District Court correctly found that theSenate plan was retrogressive.The District Court properly found that Federal Rule ofCivil Procedure 24 governs intervention in this case. Section 5 permits a State to bring "an action in the UnitedStates District Court for the District of Columbia for a declaratory judgment." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c. Section 5 doesnot limit in any way the application of the Federal Rules ofCivil Procedure to this type of lawsuit, and the statute byits terms does not bar private parties from intervening. InNAACP v. New York, 413 U. S. 345, 365 (1973), we held thatin an action under $ 5, "[i]ntervention in a federal court suitis governed by Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 24."To support its argument, Georgia relies onMorris v. Gres-sette, 432 U. S. 491 (1977). In Morris, we held that in anadministrative preclearance action, the decision to objectbelongs only to the Attorney General and is not judicially539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN477Cite as: 539 U. S. 461 (2003)Opinion of the Courtreviewable. See id., at 504-505. But Morris concernedthe administrative preclearance process, not the judicial preclearance process. Morris itself recognized the differencebetween administrative preclearance and judicial preclearance. See id., at 503-507.Here, the District Court granted the motion to intervenebecause it found that the intervenors' "analysis of the . . .Senate redistricting pla[n] identifies interests that are notadequately represented by the existing parties." App. toJuris. Statement 218a. Private parties may intervene in $ 5actions assuming they meet the requirements of Rule 24, andthe District Court did not abuse its discretion in grantingthe motion to intervene in this case. See NAACP v. NewYork, supra, at 367.IIIASection 5 of the Voting Rights Act "has a limited substantive goal: " `to insure that no voting-procedure changeswould be made that would lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise.'

Thus, a plan thatmerely preserves "current minority voting strength" is entitled to $ 5 preclearance. City of Lockhart v. United States,460 U. S. 125, 134, n. 10 (1983); Bush v. Vera, supra, at 983.Indeed, a voting change with a discriminatory but nonretrogressive purpose or effect does not violate $ 5. See Reno v.Bossier Parish School Bd., 528 U. S. 320, 341 (2000). And"no matter how unconstitutional it may be," a plan that isnot retrogressive should be precleared under $ 5. Id., at336. "[P]reclearance under $ 5 affirms nothing but the absence of backsliding." Id., at 335.Georgia argues that a plan should be precleared under $ 5if the plan would satisfy $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN478 GEORGIA v. ASHCROFTOpinion of the Court42 U. S. C. $ 1973. We have, however, "consistently under-stood" $ 2 to "combat different evils and, accordingly, to impose very different duties upon the States." Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 520 U. S. 471, 477 (1997) (BossierParish I). For example, while $ 5 is limited to particularcovered jurisdictions, $ 2 applies to all States. And the $ 2inquiry differs in significant respects from a $ 5 inquiry. Incontrast to $ 5's retrogression standard, the "essence" of a $ 2vote dilution claim is that "a certain electoral law, practice,or structure . . . cause[s] an inequality in the opportunitiesenjoyed by black and white voters to elect their preferredrepresentatives." Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, 47(1986); see also id., at 48-50 (enunciating a three-part test toestablish vote dilution); id., at 85-100 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(b). Unlike an inquiryunder $ 2, a retrogression inquiry under $ 5, "by definition,requires a comparison of a jurisdiction's new voting planwith its existing plan." Bossier Parish I, supra, at 478.While some parts of the $ 2 analysis may overlap with the$ 5 inquiry, the two sections "differ in structure, purpose,and application." Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S. 874, 883 (1994)(plurality opinion).In Bossier Parish I, we specifically held that a violation of$ 2 is not an independent reason to deny preclearance under$ 5. See 520 U. S., at 477. The reason for this holding wasstraightforward: "[R]ecognizing $ 2 violations as a basis fordenying $ 5 preclearance would inevitably make compliancewith $ 5 contingent upon compliance with $ 2. Doing sowould, for all intents and purposes, replace the standards for$ 5 with those for $ 2." Ibid.Georgia here makes the flip side of the argument thatfailed in Bossier Parish I--compliance with $ 2 suffices forpreclearance under $ 5. Yet the argument fails here for thesame reasons the argument failed in Bossier Parish I. Werefuse to equate a $ 2 vote dilution inquiry with the $ 5 retrogression standard. Georgia's argument, like the argument539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN479Cite as: 539 U. S. 461 (2003)Opinion of the Courtin Bossier Parish I, would "shift the focus of $ 5 from nonret-rogression to vote dilution, and [would] change the $ 5 benchmark from a jurisdiction's existing plan to a hypothetical,undiluted plan." Id., at 480. Instead of showing that theSenate plan is nondilutive under $ 2, Georgia must prove thatits plan is nonretrogressive under $ 5.BGeorgia argues that even if compliance with $ 2 does notautomatically result in preclearance under $ 5, its State Senate plan should be precleared because it does not lead to"a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise."Beer v. United States, supra, at 141. See, e. g., Brief for Ap-pellant 32, 36.While we have never determined the meaning of "effectiveexercise of the electoral franchise," this case requires us todo so in some detail. First, the United States and the Dis-trict Court correctly acknowledge that in examining whetherthe new plan is retrogressive, the inquiry must encompassthe entire statewide plan as a whole. See 195 F. Supp. 2d,at 73; Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-29. Thus, while the diminution ofa minority group's effective exercise of the electoral franchise in one or two districts may be sufficient to show a viola-tion of $ 5, it is only sufficient if the covered jurisdiction cannot show that the gains in the plan as a whole offset the lossin a particular district.Second, any assessment of the retrogression of a minoritygroup's effective exercise of the electoral franchise dependson an examination of all the relevant circumstances, such asthe ability of minority voters to elect their candidate ofchoice, the extent of the minority group's opportunity to par-ticipate in the political process, and the feasibility of creatinga nonretrogressive plan. See, e. g., Johnson v. De Grandy,512 U. S. 997, 1011-1012, 1020-1021 (1994);Richmond v.United States, 422 U. S. 358, 371-372 (1975); Thornburg539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN480 GEORGIA v. ASHCROFTOpinion of the Courtv. Gingles, supra, at 97-100 (O'Connor, J., concurring injudgment). "No single statistic provides courts with ashortcut to determine whether" a voting change retro-gresses from the benchmark.Johnson v. De Grandy, supra,at 1020-1021.In assessing the totality of the circumstances, a courtshould not focus solely on the comparative ability of a minority group to elect a candidate of its choice. While this factoris an important one in the $ 5 retrogression inquiry, it cannotbe dispositive or exclusive. The standard in $ 5 is simple--whether the new plan "would lead to a retrogression in theposition of racial minorities with respect to their effectiveexercise of the electoral franchise." Beer v. United States,425 U. S., at 141.The ability of minority voters to elect a candidate of theirchoice is important but often complex in practice to determine. In order to maximize the electoral success of a minority group, a State may choose to create a certain number of"safe" districts, in which it is highly likely that minority voters will be able to elect the candidate of their choice. SeeThornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S., at 48-49; id., at 87-89(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). Alternatively, aState may choose to create a greater number of districts inwhich it is likely--although perhaps not quite as likely asunder the benchmark plan--that minority voters will be ableto elect candidates of their choice. See id., at 88-89 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); cf. Pildes, Is Voting-RightsLaw Now at War With Itself? Social Science and VotingRights in the 2000s, 80 N. C. L. Rev. 1517 (2002).Section 5 does not dictate that a State must pick one ofthese methods of redistricting over another. Either option"will present the minority group with its own array of electoral risks and benefits," and presents "hard choices aboutwhat would truly `maximize' minority electoral success."Thornburg v. Gingles, supra, at 89 (O'Connor, J., concurringin judgment). On one hand, a smaller number of safe539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN481Cite as: 539 U. S. 461 (2003)Opinion of the Courtmajority-minority districts may virtually guarantee the election of a minority group's preferred candidate in those districts. Yet even if this concentration of minority voters ina few districts does not constitute the unlawful packing ofminority voters, see Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146, 153-154 (1993), such a plan risks isolating minority voters fromthe rest of the State, and risks narrowing political influenceto only a fraction of political districts. Cf. Shaw v. Reno,509 U. S., at 648-650. And while such districts may resultin more "descriptive representation" because the representatives of choice are more likely to mirror the race of the majority of voters in that district, the representation may belimited to fewer areas. See H. Pitkin, The Concept of Representation 60-91 (1967).On the other hand, spreading out minority voters over agreater number of districts creates more districts in whichminority voters may have the opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice. Such a strategy has the potentialto increase "substantive representation" in more districts,by creating coalitions of voters who together will help toachieve the electoral aspirations of the minority group. Seeid., at 114. It also, however, creates the risk that the minority group's preferred candidate may lose. Yet as we statedin Johnson v. De Grandy, supra, at 1020:"[T]here are communities in which minority citizens areable to form coalitions with voters from other racial andethnic groups, having no need to be a majority within asingle district in order to elect candidates of their choice.Those candidates may not represent perfection to everyminority voter, but minority voters are not immunefrom the obligation to pull, haul, and trade to find common political ground, the virtue of which is not to beslighted in applying a statute meant to hasten the waning of racism in American politics."539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN482 GEORGIA v. ASHCROFTOpinion of the CourtSection 5 gives States the flexibility to choose one theory ofeffective representation over the other.In addition to the comparative ability of a minority groupto elect a candidate of its choice, the other highly relevantfactor in a retrogression inquiry is the extent to which a newplan changes the minority group's opportunity to participatein the political process. " `[T]he power to influence the political process is not limited to winning elections.' " Thornburg v. Gingles, supra, at 99 (O'Connor, J., concurring injudgment) (quoting Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109, 132(1986)); see alsoWhite v. Regester, 412 U. S. 755, 766-767(1973); Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U. S. 124, 149-160 (1971);Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S., at 1011-1012.Thus, a court must examine whether a new plan adds orsubtracts "influence districts"--where minority voters maynot be able to elect a candidate of choice but can play asubstantial, if not decisive, role in the electoral process.Cf. Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, 947, n. 21 (1996) (Stevens,J., dissenting); Hays v. Louisiana, 936 F. Supp. 360, 364, n. 17(WD La. 1996); Johnson v. De Grandy, supra, at 1011-1012; Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S., at 98-100 (O'Connor,J., concurring in judgment). In assessing the comparativeweight of these influence districts, it is important to consider"the likelihood that candidates elected without decisive minority support would be willing to take the minority's interests into account." Id., at 100 (O'Connor, J., concurring injudgment). In fact, various studies have suggested that themost effective way to maximize minority voting strengthmay be to create more influence or coalitional districts. See,e. g., Lublin, Racial Redistricting and African-American Representation: A Critique of "Do Majority-Minority DistrictsMaximize Substantive Black Representation in Congress?"93 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 183, 185 (1999) (noting that racial redistricting in the early 1990's, which created more majorityminority districts, made Congress "less likely to adoptinitiatives supported by blacks"); Cameron, Epstein, &539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN483Cite as: 539 U. S. 461 (2003)Opinion of the CourtO'Halloran, Do Majority-Minority Districts Maximize Sub-stantive Black Representation in Congress? 90 Am. Pol.Sci. Rev. 794, 808 (1996) (concluding that the "[d]istrictingschemes that maximize the number of minority representatives do not necessarily maximize substantive minority rep-resentation"); C. Swain, Black Faces, Black Interests 193-234 (1995); Pildes, 80 N. C. L. Rev., at 1517; Grofman,Handley, & Lublin, Drawing Effective Minority Districts: AConceptual Framework and Some Empirical Evidence, 79N. C. L. Rev. 1383 (2001).Section 5 leaves room for States to use these types of influence and coalitional districts. Indeed, the State's choiceultimately may rest on a political choice of whether substantive or descriptive representation is preferable. See Pitkin,supra, at 142; Swain, supra, at 5. The State may choose,consistent with $ 5, that it is better to risk having fewer minority representatives in order to achieve greater overallrepresentation of a minority group by increasing the numberof representatives sympathetic to the interests of minorityvoters. See Thornburg v. Gingles, supra, at 87-89, 99(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); cf. Johnson v. DeGrandy, 512 U. S., at 1020.In addition to influence districts, one other method of assessing the minority group's opportunity to participate in thepolitical process is to examine the comparative position oflegislative leadership, influence, and power for representatives of the benchmark majority-minority districts. A legislator, no less than a voter, is "not immune from the obligationto pull, haul, and trade to find common political ground."Ibid. Indeed, in a representative democracy, the very purpose of voting is to delegate to chosen representatives thepower to make and pass laws. The ability to exert morecontrol over that process is at the core of exercising politicalpower. A lawmaker with more legislative influence hasmore potential to set the agenda, to participate in closeddoor meetings, to negotiate from a stronger position, and to539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN484 GEORGIA v. ASHCROFTOpinion of the Courtshake hands on a deal. Maintaining or increasing legislativepositions of power for minority voters' representatives ofchoice, while not dispositive by itself, can show the lack ofretrogressive effect under $ 5.And it is also significant, though not dispositive, whetherthe representatives elected from the very districts createdand protected by the Voting Rights Act support the newdistricting plan. The District Court held that the support oflegislators from benchmark majority-minority districts mayshow retrogressive purpose, but it is not relevant in assess-ing retrogressive effect. See 195 F. Supp. 2d, at 89; see alsopost, at 503 (Souter, J., dissenting). But we think this evidence is also relevant for retrogressive effect. As the dissent recognizes, the retrogression inquiry asks how "voterswill probably act in the circumstances in which they live."Post, at 509. The representatives of districts created to ensure continued minority participation in the political processhave some knowledge about how "voters will probably act"and whether the proposed change will decrease minority voters' effective exercise of the electoral franchise.The dissent maintains that standards for determining nonretrogression under $ 5 that we announce today create a situation where "[i]t is very hard to see anything left of " $ 5.Post, at 495. But the dissent ignores that the ability of aminority group to elect a candidate of choice remains an integral feature in any $ 5 analysis. Cf. Thornburg v. Gingles,supra, at 98 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). Andthe dissent agrees that the addition or subtraction of coalitional districts is relevant to the $ 5 inquiry. See post, at492, 504. Yet assessing whether a plan with coalitional districts is retrogressive is just as fact-intensive as whether aplan with both influence and coalitional districts is retrogressive. As Justice Souter recognized for the Court inthe $ 2 context, a court or the Department of Justice shouldassess the totality of circumstances in determining retrogression under $ 5. See Johnson v. De Grandy, supra, at539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN485Cite as: 539 U. S. 461 (2003)Opinion of the Court1020-1021. And it is of course true that evidence of racialpolarization is one of many factors relevant in assessingwhether a minority group is able to elect a candidate ofchoice or to exert a significant influence in a particular district. See Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S., at 37; id., at 100-104 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); see also Whitev.Regester, 412 U. S. 755 (1973); Zimmer v. McKeithen, 485F. 2d 1297 (CA5 1973) (en banc).The dissent nevertheless asserts that it "cannot be right"that the $ 5 inquiry goes beyond assessing whether a minority group can elect a candidate of its choice. Post, at 494.But except for the general statement of retrogression inBeer, the dissent cites no law to support its contention thatretrogression should focus solely on the ability of a minoritygroup to elect a candidate of choice. As Justice Souterhimself, writing for the Court inJohnson v. De Grandy,supra, at 1011-1012, has recognized, the "extent of the opportunities minority voters enjoy to participate in the politi-cal processes" is an important factor to consider in assessinga $ 2 vote-dilution inquiry. See also Thornburg v. Gingles,supra, at 98-100 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).In determining how the new districting plan differs from thebenchmark plan, the same standard should apply to $ 5.CThe District Court failed to consider all the relevant fac-tors when it examined whether Georgia's Senate plan resulted in a retrogression of black voters' effective exerciseof the electoral franchise. First, while the District Courtacknowledged the importance of assessing the statewideplan as a whole, the court focused too narrowly on proposedSenate Districts 2, 12, and 26. It did not examine the in-creases in the black voting age population that occurred inmany of the other districts. Second, the District Court didnot explore in any meaningful depth any other factor beyondthe comparative ability of black voters in the majority539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN486 GEORGIA v. ASHCROFTOpinion of the Courtminority districts to elect a candidate of their choice. Indoing so, it paid inadequate attention to the support of legislators representing the benchmark majority-minority districts and the maintenance of the legislative influence ofthose representatives.The District Court correctly recognized that the increasein districts with a substantial minority of black voters isan important factor in the retrogression inquiry. See 195F. Supp. 2d, at 75-78. Nevertheless, it did not adequatelyapply this consideration to the facts of this case. The District Court ignored the evidence of numerous other districtsshowing an increase in black voting age population, as wellas the other evidence that Georgia decided that a way toincrease black voting strength was to adopt a plan that "unpacked" the high concentration of minority voters in themajority-minority districts. Its statement that Georgia didnot "presen[t] evidence regarding potential gains in minorityvoting strength in Senate Districts other than Districts 2, 12and 26" is therefore clearly erroneous. Id., at 94. Like thedissent, we accept the District Court's findings that the reductions in black voting age population in proposed Districts2, 12, and 26 to just over 50% make it marginally less likelythat minority voters can elect a candidate of their choice inthose districts, although we note that Georgia introduced evidence showing that approximately one-third of white voterswould support a black candidate in those districts, see id., at66, and that the United States' own expert admitted that theresults of statewide elections in Georgia show that "therewould be a `very good chance' that . . . African Americancandidates would win election in the reconstituted districts."Id., at 71; see also id., at 84-85. Nevertheless, regardless ofany racially polarized voting or diminished opportunity forblack voters to elect a candidate of their choice in proposedDistricts 2, 12, and 26, the District Court's inquiry was toonarrow.539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN487Cite as: 539 U. S. 461 (2003)Opinion of the CourtIn the face of Georgia's evidence that the Senate plan as awhole is not retrogressive, the United States introducednothing apart from the evidence that it would be more diffi-cult for minority voters to elect their candidate of choice inDistricts 2, 12, and 26. As the District Court stated, theUnited States did not introduce any evidence to rebut Georgia's evidence that the increase in black voting age population in the other districts offsets any decrease in black votingage population in the three contested districts: "[T]he UnitedStates' evidence was extremely limited in scope--focusingonly on three contested districts in the State Senate plan."Id., at 37. Indeed, the District Court noted that the UnitedStates' evidence "was not designed to permit the court toassess the overall impact" of the Senate plan. Ibid.Given the evidence submitted in this case, we find thatGeorgia likely met its burden of showing nonretrogression.The increase in black voting age population in the other districts likely offsets any marginal decrease in the black votingage population in the three districts that the District Courtfound retrogressive. Using the overlay of the 2000 censusnumbers, Georgia's strategy of "unpacking" minority votersin some districts to create more influence and coalitional districts is apparent. Under the 2000 census numbers, thenumber of majority black voting age population districtsin the new plan increases by one, the number of districtswith a black voting age population of between 30% and 50%increases by two, and the number of districts with a blackvoting age population of between 25% and 30% increases byanother 2. See Pl. Exhs. 1D, 2C; see also supra, at 470-471.Using the census numbers in effect at the time the benchmark plan was enacted to assess the benchmark plan, thedifference is even more striking. Under those figures, thenew plan increases from 10 to 13 the number of districts witha majority-black voting age population and increases from 8to 13 the number of districts with a black voting age population of between 30% and 50%. See Pl. Exhs. 1C, 2C. Thus,539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN488 GEORGIA v. ASHCROFTOpinion of the Courtthe new plan creates 8 new districts--out of 56--where blackvoters as a group can play a substantial or decisive role inthe electoral process. Indeed, under the census figures inuse at the time Georgia enacted its benchmark plan, theblack voting age population in Districts 2, 12, and 26 doesnot decrease to the extent indicated by the District Court.District 2 drops from 59.27% black voting age population to50.31%. District 26 drops from 53.45% black voting age population to 50.80%. And District 12 actually increases, from46.50% black voting age population to 50.66%. See Pl. Exhs.1C, 2C.2 And regardless of any potential retrogression insome districts, $ 5 permits Georgia to offset the decline inthose districts with an increase in the black voting age population in other districts. The testimony from those who designed the Senate plan confirms what the statistics suggest--that Georgia's goal was to "unpack" the minorityvoters from a few districts to increase blacks' effective exer2 The dissent summarily rejects any inquiry into the benchmark planusing the census numbers in effect at the time the redistricting plan waspassed. See post, at 506. Yet we think it is relevant to examine how thenew plan differs from the benchmark plan as originally enacted by thelegislature. The $ 5 inquiry, after all, revolves around the change fromthe previous plan. The 1990 census numbers are far from "irrelevant."Ibid. Rather, examining the benchmark plan with the census numbers ineffect at the time the State enacted its plan comports with the one-person,one-vote principle of Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533 (1964), and its progeny. When the decennial census numbers are released, States must redistrict to account for any changes or shifts in population. But before thenew census, States operate under the legal fiction that even 10 years later,the plans are constitutionally apportioned. After the new enumeration,no districting plan is likely to be legally enforceable if challenged, giventhe shifts and changes in a population over 10 years. And if the Statehas not redistricted in response to the new census figures, a federal courtwill ensure that the districts comply with the one-person, one-vote mandate before the next election. See, e. g., Branch v. Smith, 538 U. S. 254(2003); Lawyer v. Department of Justice, 521 U. S. 567 (1997); Growe v.Emison, 507 U. S. 25 (1993).539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN489Cite as: 539 U. S. 461 (2003)Opinion of the Courtcise of the electoral franchise in more districts. See supra,at 469-471.Other evidence supports the implausibility of finding ret-rogression here. An examination of black voters' opportunities to participate in the political process shows, if anything,an increase in the effective exercise of the electoral franchise. It certainly does not indicate retrogression. The 34districts in the proposed plan with a black voting age popula-tion of above 20% consist almost entirely of districts thathave an overall percentage of Democratic votes of above50%. See Pl. Exh. 2D. The one exception is proposed District 4, with a black voting age population of 30.51% and anoverall Democratic percentage of 48.86%. See ibid. Thesestatistics make it more likely as a matter of fact that blackvoters will constitute an effective voting bloc, even if theycannot always elect the candidate of their choice. SeeThornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S., at 100 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). These statistics also buttress the testimony of the designers of the plan such as Senator Brown,who stated that the goal of the plan was to maintain or increase black voting strength and relatedly to increase theprospects of Democratic victory. See supra, at 469-470.The testimony of Congressman John Lewis is not so easilydismissed. Congressman Lewis is not a member of theState Senate and thus has less at stake personally in theoutcome of this litigation. Congressman Lewis testifiedthat "giving real power to black voters comes from the kindof redistricting efforts the State of Georgia has made," andthat the Senate plan "will give real meaning to voting forAfrican Americans" because "you have a greater chance ofputting in office people that are going to be responsive." Pl.Exh. 21, at 21-23. Section 5 gives States the flexibility toimplement the type of plan that Georgia has submitted forpreclearance--a plan that increases the number of districtswith a majority-black voting age population, even if it meansthat in some of those districts, minority voters will face a539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN490 GEORGIA v. ASHCROFTOpinion of the Courtsomewhat reduced opportunity to elect a candidate of theirchoice. Cf.Thornburg v. Gingles, supra, at 89 (O'Connor,J., concurring in judgment).The dissent's analysis presumes that we are deciding thatGeorgia's Senate plan is not retrogressive. See post, at 501-508. To the contrary, we hold only that the District Courtdid not engage in the correct retrogression analysis becauseit focused too heavily on the ability of the minority group toelect a candidate of its choice in the majority-minority districts. While the District Court engaged in a thoroughanalysis of the issue, we must remand the case for the District Court to examine the facts using the standard that weannounce today. We leave it for the District Court to determine whether Georgia has indeed met its burden of proof.The dissent justifies its conclusion here on the ground thatthe District Court did not clearly err in its factual determination. But the dissent does not appear to dispute that ifthe District Court's legal standard was incorrect, the decision below should be vacated.The purpose of the Voting Rights Act is to prevent discrimination in the exercise of the electoral franchise and tofoster our transformation to a society that is no longer fixated on race. Cf. Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S., at 1020;Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S., at 657. As Congressman Lewisstated: "I think that's what the [civil rights] struggle was allabout, to create what I like to call a truly interracial democracy in the South. In the movement, we would call it creating the beloved community, an all-inclusive community,where we would be able to forget about race and color andsee people as people, as human beings, just as citizens." Pl.Exh. 21, at 14. While courts and the Department of Justiceshould be vigilant in ensuring that States neither reduce theeffective exercise of the electoral franchise nor discriminateagainst minority voters, the Voting Rights Act, as properlyinterpreted, should encourage the transition to a societywhere race no longer matters: a society where integration539US2 Unit: $U80 [07-05-05 18:55:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN491Cite as: 539 U.

Reno, supra, at 657.IVThe District Court is in a better position to reweigh allthe facts in the record in the first instance in light of ourexplication of retrogression. The judgment of the DistrictCourt for the District of Columbia, accordingly, is vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistentwith this opinion.
