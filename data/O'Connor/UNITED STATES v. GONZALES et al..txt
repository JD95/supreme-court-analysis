We are asked to decide whether a federal court may directthat a prison sentence under 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c) run concurrently with a state-imposed sentence, even though $ 924(c)*Leah J.

We hold that it may not.IRespondents were arrested in a drug sting operationduring which two of them pulled guns on undercover policeofficers. All three were convicted in New Mexico courtson charges arising from the holdup. The state courts sentenced them to prison terms ranging from 13 to 17 years.After they began to serve their state sentences, respondentswere convicted in federal court of committing various drugoffenses connected to the sting operation, and conspiring todo so, in violation of 21 U. S. C. $$ 841 and 846. They werealso convicted of using firearms during and in relation tothose drug trafficking crimes, in violation of 18 U. S. C.$ 924(c). Respondents received sentences ranging from 120to 147 months in prison, of which 60 months reflected themandatory sentence required for their firearms convictions.Pursuant to $ 924(c), the District Court ordered that the por-tion of respondents' federal sentences attributable to thedrug convictions run concurrently with their state sentences,with the remaining 60 months due to the firearms offensesto run consecutively to both.The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit vacated respondents' sentences for the firearms violations, on theground that the $ 924(c) sentences should have run concurrently with the state prison terms. 65 F. 3d 814 (1995).(The court also vacated respondents' substantive drug convictions and dealt with various other sentencing issues notbefore us.) Although the Court of Appeals recognized thatother Circuits had uniformly "held that $ 924(c)'s plain lan-guage prohibits sentences imposed under that statute fromrunning concurrently with state sentences," it neverthelessthought that "a literal reading of the statutory languagewould produce an absurd result." Id., at 819. Feeling520US1 Unit: $U31 [09-10-99 14:11:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN4 UNITED STATES v. GONZALESOpinion of the Courtobliged to "venture into the thicket of legislative history,"id., at 820 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted),the court found a line in a Senate Committee Report indi-cating that " `the mandatory sentence under the revised subsection 924(c) [should] be served prior to the start of thesentence for the underlying or any other offense,' "ibid.(quoting S. Rep. No. 98-225, pp. 313-314 (1983) (hereinafterS. Rep.)) (emphasis deleted). If this statement were appliedliterally, respondents would have to serve first their statesentences, then their 5-year federal firearms sentences, andfinally the sentences for their narcotics convictions--eventhough the narcotics sentences normally would have run con-currently with the state sentences, since they all arose outof the same criminal activity. 65 F. 3d, at 821. To avoidthis irrational result, the court held that "$ 924(c)'s mandatory five-year sentence may run concurrently with a pre-viously imposedstate sentence that a defendant has alreadybegun to serve." Id., at 819.We granted certiorari, 518 U. S. 1003, and now vacateand remand.IIOur analysis begins, as always, with the statutory text.Section 924(c)(1) provides:"Whoever, during and in relation to any . . . drug traf-ficking crime . . . for which he may be prosecuted in acourt of the United States, uses or carries a firearm,shall, in addition to the punishment provided for suchcrime . . . , be sentenced to imprisonment for five years. . . . Notwithstanding any other provision of law, thecourt shall not place on probation or suspend the sen-tence of any person convicted of a violation of this subsection, nor shall the term of imprisonment imposedunder this subsection run concurrently withany otherterm of imprisonment including that imposed for the . . .drug trafficking crime in which the firearm was used orcarried." 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1) (emphasis added).520US1 Unit: $U31 [09-10-99 14:11:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN5Cite as: 520 U. S. 1 (1997)Opinion of the CourtThe question we face is whether the phrase "any other termof imprisonment" "means what it says, or whether it shouldbe limited to some subset" of prison sentences, Maine v.Thiboutot, 448 U. S. 1, 4 (1980)--namely, only federal sentences. Read naturally, the word "any" has an expansivemeaning, that is, "one or some indiscriminately of what-ever kind." Webster's Third New International Dictionary97 (1976). Congress did not add any language limitingthe breadth of that word, and so we must read $ 924(c) asreferring to all "term[s] of imprisonment," including thoseimposed by state courts. Cf.United States v. AlvarezSanchez, 511 U. S. 350, 358 (1994) (noting that statute referring to "any law enforcement officer" includes "federal, state,or local" officers); Collector v. Hubbard, 12 Wall. 1, 15 (1871)(stating "it is quite clear" that a statute prohibiting the filingof suit "in any court" "includes the State courts as well as theFederal courts," because "there is not a word in the [statute]tending to show that the words `in any court' are not usedin their ordinary sense"). There is no basis in the text forlimiting $ 924(c) to federal sentences.In his dissenting opinion, Justice Stevens suggests thatthe word "any" as used in the first sentence of $ 924(c) "unquestionably has the meaning `any federal.' " Post, at 14.In that first sentence, however, Congress explicitly limitedthe scope of the phrase "any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime" to those "for which [a defendant] may be prosecuted in a court of the United States." Given that Congress expressly limited the phrase "any crime" to onlyfederal crimes, we find it significant that no similar restriction modifies the phrase "any other term of imprisonment,"which appears only two sentences later and is at issue in thiscase. See Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983)(" `Where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the sameAct, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion' ").520US1 Unit: $U31 [09-10-99 14:11:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN6 UNITED STATES v. GONZALESOpinion of the CourtThe Court of Appeals also found ambiguity in Congress'decision, in drafting $ 924(c), to prohibit concurrent sentences instead of simply mandating consecutive sentences.65 F. 3d, at 820. Unlike the lower court, however, we seenothing remarkable (much less ambiguous) about Congress'choice of words. Because consecutive and concurrent sen-tences are exact opposites, Congress implicitly required onewhen it prohibited the other. This "ambiguity" is, in anyevent, beside the point because this phraseology has no bearing on whether Congress meant $ 924(c) sentences to run con-secutively only to other federal terms of imprisonment.Given the straightforward statutory command, there isno reason to resort to legislative history.Connecticut Nat.Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 254 (1992). Indeed, farfrom clarifying the statute, the legislative history only mud-dies the waters. The excerpt from the Senate Report accompanying the 1984 amendment to $ 924(c), relied upon bythe Court of Appeals, reads:"[T]he Committee intends that the mandatory sentenceunder the revised subsection 924(c) be served prior tothe start of the sentence for the underlying or any otheroffense." S. Rep., at 313-314.This snippet of legislative history injects into $ 924(c) anentirely new idea--that a defendant must serve the 5-yearprison term for his firearms conviction before any other sen-tences. This added requirement, however, is "in no way anchored in the text of the statute." Shannon v. UnitedStates, 512 U. S. 573, 583 (1994).The Court of Appeals was troubled that this rule mightlead to irrational results. Normally, a district court has authority to decide whether federal prison terms should runconcurrently with or consecutively to other prison sentences.18 U. S. C. $ 3584(a) (vesting power in district court to runmost prison terms either concurrently or consecutively);United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual520US1 Unit: $U31 [09-10-99 14:11:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN7Cite as: 520 U. S. 1 (1997)Opinion of the Court$ 5G1.3 (Nov. 1995) (USSG) (guiding court's discretion under$ 3584(a)). If the prison terms for respondents' other federal sentences could not begin until after their $ 924(c) termswere completed, however, the District Court would effectively be stripped of its statutory power to decide whetherthe sentences for the underlying narcotics offenses shouldrun concurrently with respondents' state terms of imprisonment. 65 F. 3d, at 822. The court observed that such a rulecould lead to dramatically higher sentences, particularly forthe respondents in this case. Perez, for example, is alreadyserving a 17-year state prison term for his role in the holdup.Normally, his 7.25-year federal sentence for narcotics possession would run concurrently with that state term underUSSG $ 5G1.3(b); his 5-year firearm sentence under $ 924(c)would follow both, for a total of 22 years in prison. If hemust serve his federal narcotics sentence after his 5-yearfirearms sentence, however, he would face a total of 29.25years in prison. 65 F. 3d, at 821.Seeking to avoid this conflict between $ 924(c) (as reinterpreted in light of its legislative history) and $ 3584(a), theCourt of Appeals held that $ 924(c) only prohibited runningfederal terms of imprisonment concurrently. Ibid. It alsoreasoned that such a narrow reading was necessary because"there is no way in which a later-sentencing federal courtcan cause the mandatory 5-year $ 924(c) sentence to beserved before a state sentence that is already beingserved." Ibid.We see three flaws in this reasoning. First, the statutorytexts of $$ 924(c) and 3584(a), unvarnished by legislativehistory, are entirely consistent. Section 924(c) specifiesonly that a court must not run a firearms sentence concurrently with other prison terms. It leaves plenty of roomfor a court to run other sentences--whether for state or federal offenses--concurrently with one another pursuant to$ 3584(a) and USSG $ 5G1.3. The statutes clash only if weengraft onto $ 924(c) a requirement found only in a single520US1 Unit: $U31 [09-10-99 14:11:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN8 UNITED STATES v. GONZALESOpinion of the Courtsentence buried in the legislative history: that the firearmssentence must run first. We therefore follow the text,rather than the legislative history, of $ 924(c). By disregard-ing the suggestion that a district court must specify thata sentence for a firearms conviction be served before othersentences, we give full meaning to the texts of both $$ 924(c)and 3584(a). SeeUnited States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat.76, 95-96 (1820) (Marshall, C. J.) ("Where there is no ambigu-ity in the words, there is no room for construction. Thecase must be a strong one indeed, which would justify acourt in departing from the plain meaning of words . . . insearch of an intention which the words themselves did notsuggest").Second, even if we ignored the plain language of $ 924(c)and required courts to list the order in which a defendantmust serve the sentences for different convictions, we wouldthereby create a rule that is superfluous in light of $ 3584(c).That statute instructs the Bureau of Prisons to treat multiple terms of imprisonment, whether imposed concurrently orconsecutively, "for administrative purposes as a single, aggregate term of imprisonment." Ibid. As a practical matter, then, it makes no difference whether a court specifiesthe sequence in which each portion of an aggregate sentencemust be served. We will not impose on sentencing courtsnew duties that, in view of other statutory commands, willbe effectively meaningless.Third, the Court of Appeals' solution--to allow $ 924(c)prison terms to run concurrently with state sentences--doesnot eliminate any anomaly that arises when a firearms sentence must run "first." Although it is clear that a prisonterm under $ 924(c) cannot possibly run before an earlier imposed state prison term, the same holds true when a prisoneris already serving a federal sentence. See $ 3585(a) (providing that a federal prison term commences when the defendant is received into custody or voluntarily arrives to beginserving the sentence). Because it is impossible to start a520US1 Unit: $U31 [09-10-99 14:11:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN9Cite as: 520 U. S. 1 (1997)Opinion of the Court$ 924(c) sentence before any prison term that the prisoner isalready serving, whether imposed by a state or federal court,limiting the phrase "any other term of imprisonment" tostate sentences does not get rid of the problem. Thus, wethink that the Court of Appeals both invented the problemand devised the wrong solution.Justice Breyer questions, in dissent, whether Congresswanted to impose a $ 924(c) sentence on a defendant who isalready serving a prison term pursuant to a virtually identical state sentencing enhancement statute. Post, at 15. Afederal court could not (for double jeopardy reasons) sentence a person to two consecutive federal prison terms for asingle violation of a federal criminal statute, such as $ 924(c).If Congress cannot impose two consecutive federal $ 924(c)sentences, the dissent argues, it is unlikely that Congresswould have wanted to stack a $ 924(c) sentence onto a prisonterm under a virtually identical state firearms enhancement.Ibid.As we have already observed, however, the straightforward language of $ 924(c) leaves no room to speculateabout congressional intent. See supra, at 4-5. The statutespeaks of "any term of imprisonment" without limitation,and there is no intimation that Congress meant $ 924(c)sentences to run consecutively only to certain types ofprison terms. District courts have some discretion underthe Sentencing Guidelines, of course, in cases where relatedoffenses are prosecuted in multiple proceedings, to establishsentences "with an eye toward having such punishments approximate the total penalty that would have been imposedhad the sentences for the different offenses been imposed atthe same time . . . ." Witte v. United States, 515 U. S. 389,404 (1995) (discussing USSG $ 5G1.3). See post, at 14-15(Breyer, J., dissenting). When Congress enacted $ 924(c)'sconsecutive-sentencing provision, however, it cabined thesentencing discretion of district courts in a single circumstance: When a defendant violates $ 924(c), his sentencing en520US1 Unit: $U31 [09-10-99 14:11:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN10 UNITED STATES v. GONZALESOpinion of the Courthancement under that statute must run consecutively to allother prison terms. Given this clear legislative directive, itis not for the courts to carve out statutory exceptions basedon judicial perceptions of good sentencing policy.Other language in $ 924(c) reinforces our conclusion. In1984, Congress amended $ 924(c) so that its sentencing enhancement would apply regardless of whether the underlying felony statute "provides for an enhanced punishment ifcommitted by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon ordevice." Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, Pub. L.98-473, $ 1005(a), 98 Stat. 2138-2139. Congress thus repudiated the result we reached in Busic v. United States, 446U. S. 398 (1980), in which we held that "prosecution and enhanced sentencing under $ 924(c) is simply not permissiblewhere the predicate felony statute contains its own enhancement provision," irrespective of whether the Governmenthad actually sought an enhancement under that predicatestatute. Id., at 404; see also Simpson v. United States, 435U. S. 6, 15 (1978) (holding that a federal court may not impose sentences under both $ 924(c) and the weapon enhancement under the armed bank robbery statute, 18 U. S. C.$ 2113, based on a single criminal transaction). Our holdingsin these cases were based on our conclusion that the unamended text of $ 924(c) left us with little "more than aguess" as to how Congress meant to mesh that statute withthe sentencing enhancement provisions scattered throughoutthe federal criminal code. Simpson, supra, at 15; Busic,supra, at 405. The 1984 amendment, however, eliminatedthese ambiguities. At that point, Congress made clear itsdesire to run $ 924(c) enhancements consecutively to all otherprison terms, regardless of whether they were imposedunder firearms enhancement statutes similar to $ 924(c). Wetherefore cannot agree with Justice Breyer's contentionthat our interpretation of $ 924(c) distinguishes between"those subject to undischarged state, and those subject to520US1 Unit: $U31 [09-10-99 14:11:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN11Cite as: 520 U. S. 1 (1997)Opinion of the Courtundischarged federal, sentences." Post, at 16. Both sortsof defendants face sentences for their other convictions thatrun concurrently with or consecutively to each other according to normal sentencing principles, plus an enhancementunder $ 924(c). In short, in light of the 1984 amendment, wethink that Congress has foreclosed the dissent's argumentthat $ 924(c) covers only federal sentences.Finally, we pause to comment on Justice Stevens' concern over how today's decision might affect other caseswhere "the state trial follows the federal trial and the statejudge imposes a concurrent sentence" that might be viewedas inconsistent with $ 924(c). Post, at 12. That, of course,was not the sequence in which the respondents were sentenced in this case, and so we have no occasion to decidewhether a later sentencing state court is bound to order itssentence to run consecutively to the $ 924(c) term of imprisonment. See ibid. All that is before us today is the authority of a later sentencing federal court to impose a consecutivesentence under $ 924(c). We are hesitant to reach beyondthe facts of this case to decide a question that is not squarelypresented for our review.IIIIn sum, we hold that the plain language of 18 U. S. C.$ 924(c) forbids a federal district court to direct that a termof imprisonment under that statute run concurrently withany other term of imprisonment, whether state or federal.The statute does not, however, limit the court's authorityto order that other federal sentences run concurrently withor consecutively to other prison terms--state or federal--under $ 3584.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and thecase is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.
