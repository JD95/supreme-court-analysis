UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtnal Procedure 31(e) right to a special jury verdict on forfeit-ure can only be waived following specific advice from theDistrict Court as to the existence and scope of this rightand an express, written waiver.IIn May 1992, Joseph Libretti was charged in a multicountsuperseding indictment with violations of various federaldrug, firearms, and money-laundering laws. Included in theindictment was a count alleging that Libretti engaged in acontinuing criminal enterprise (CCE), in violation of 21U. S. C. $ 848, by operating a cocaine and marijuana distri-bution organization in Wyoming and Colorado from 1984to 1992. Conviction under $ 848 subjects a defendant to,among other penalties, "the forfeiture prescribed in section 853." 1 21 U. S. C. $ 848(a). Accordingly, the indict1 Section 853(a) provides for criminal forfeiture of drug-taintedproperty:"(a) Property subject to criminal forfeiture. Any person convicted ofa violation of this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter punishableby imprisonment for more than one year shall forfeit to the United States,irrespective of any provision of State law--"(1) any property constituting, or derived from, any proceeds the personobtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such violation;"(2) any of the person's property used, or intended to be used, in anymanner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, such violation; and"(3) in the case of a person convicted of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise in violation of section 848 of this title, the person shallforfeit, in addition to any property described in paragraph (1) or (2), anyof his interest in, claims against, and property or contractual rights affording a source of control over, the continuing criminal enterprise."The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in additionto any other sentence imposed pursuant to this subchapter or subchapterII of this chapter, that the person forfeit to the United States all propertydescribed in this subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized bythis part, a defendant who derives profits or other proceeds from an516us1$$5J 10-22-98 10:36:31 PAGES OPINPGT33Cite as: 516 U. S. 29 (1995)Opinion of the Courtment further alleged that the Government was entitled toforfeiture of property that was obtained from or used to facilitate Libretti's drug offenses, including, but not limited to,various assets specified in the indictment. See Fed. RuleCrim. Proc. 7(c)(2) ("No judgment of forfeiture may be en-tered in a criminal proceeding unless the indictment or theinformation shall allege the extent of the interest or prop-erty subject to forfeiture").Trial began in September 1992. The Government pre-sented testimony from 18 witnesses, including several individuals who had purchased cocaine or marijuana from Li-bretti, to establish Libretti's involvement in the possessionand distribution of considerable amounts of narcotics. Thetestimony also reflected Libretti's purchase of a home, anautomobile, and dozens of automatic and semiautomaticweapons during a time when he had only modest sourcesof legitimate income. Finally, the testimony revealed thatLibretti stored large amounts of money and drugs in safetydeposit boxes and storage facilities away from his home.Following four days of testimony, Libretti and the Government entered into a plea agreement, by the terms of whichLibretti agreed to plead guilty to the CCE count of the indictment (count 6). The Government in return agreed notto pursue additional charges against Libretti and to recommend that he be sentenced to the mandatory minimum of 20years' imprisonment. Paragraph 10 of the plea agreementprovided that Libretti would"transfer his right, title, and interest in all of his assetsto the Division of Criminal Investigation of the Wyooffense may be fined not more than twice the gross profits or otherproceeds."In addition, $ 853(p) provides that, when property subject to forfeitureunder subsection (a) cannot be recovered for various reasons, "the courtshall order the forfeiture of any other property of the defendant up to thevalue of" the forfeitable but unrecoverable assets.516us1$$5J 10-22-98 10:36:31 PAGES OPINPGT34 LIBRETTI v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtming Attorney General including, but not limited to: allreal estate; all personal property, including guns, thecomputer, and every other item now in the possessionof the United States; all bank accounts, investments,retirement accounts, cash, cashier's checks, travelerschecks and funds of any kind."Two other paragraphs of the plea agreement also made refer-ence to the contemplated forfeiture. Paragraph 2 describedthe maximum statutory penalty for the offense to which Li-bretti agreed to plead guilty, which included "forfeiture of allknown assets as prescribed in 21 U. S. C. $ 853 and assetswhich are discovered at any later time up to $1,500,000." Inparagraph 9, Libretti agreed to "identify all assets that wereused to facilitate his criminal activity" and to "provide complete financial disclosure forms requiring the listing of assetsand financial interests." Finally, Libretti acknowledged inthe agreement "that by pleading guilty to Count Six of theIndictment, he waive[d] various constitutional rights, including the right to a jury trial." It is beyond dispute thatLibretti received a favorable plea agreement. The Government recommended that Libretti receive the minimumsentence for conviction under $ 848, and agreed to drop allother counts in the indictment. One of those counts chargedLibretti with use of a firearm equipped with a silencerduring the commission of a drug offense, which mandates a30-year sentence consecutive to the term of imprisonmenton the underlying drug offense. 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1). Li-bretti also faced a potential fine of up to $2 million. 21U. S. C. $$ 848(a), 853(a).At the subsequent hearing on the plea agreement, the trialjudge advised Libretti of his rights, including his right toa jury trial. The court also clarified the consequences ofLibretti's plea, including the facts that a plea of guilty wouldmean "the end of this trial," that "the jury [would] not . . .decide whether [he's] guilty or not," and that "all the prop-erty that's described in . . . Count 6 could be forfeited to516us1$$5J 10-22-98 10:36:31 PAGES OPINPGT35Cite as: 516 U. S. 29 (1995)Opinion of the Courtthe United States." App. 87, 88. Libretti was then placedunder oath. He admitted that his plea was voluntary andindicated that he had read and understood the significance ofthe indictment and the plea agreement, including the factthat "all of [his] property could be forfeited, the propertythat is owned by [him] by reason of any drug transaction."Id., at 100. Libretti's only question about the plea agreement pertained to paragraph 2, which provided for futureforfeiture of assets up to $1,500,000. The District Court assured Libretti that future forfeiture would be limited to sub-sequently discovered drug-tainted assets, and that his futurelegitimate income would not be forfeited. Id., at 88-89.After a lengthy exchange, in which the court reviewed eachsubparagraph describing the violations that composed theCCE charge and Libretti acknowledged each factual allegation, the District Court found that the guilty plea was voluntary and factually based. Id., at 121.Following preparation of a presentence report, the DistrictCourt held a sentencing hearing, at which Libretti was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment, to be followed by 5 yearsof supervised release, and ordered to pay a $5,000 fine as wellas a mandatory $50 assessment and to perform 500 hoursof community service. The Government filed a motion forforfeiture of Libretti's assets, in keeping with the plea agreement. Libretti's counsel offered no objection at the sentencing hearing, declaring that the forfeiture statute was "aharsh law" and "a bitter pill dealt by Congress," but conceding that it was "a pill we must swallow." Id., at 149. Atthe conclusion of the hearing, however, Libretti stated on therecord that he "would just like to object to what [he saw] asa failure to find any factual basis for the whole forfeiture."Id., at 154. The District Judge noted the objection, but replied that "the evidence that I heard before me in the two[sic] days of trial I think is sufficient to warrant the grantingof forfeiture. I think I have no alternative." Ibid. OnDecember 23, 1992, the District Court entered an order516us1$$5J 10-22-98 10:36:31 PAGES OPINPGT36 LIBRETTI v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtof forfeiture pursuant to 21 U. S. C. $ 853. The order listedspecific property to be forfeited, including a parcel of realproperty in Wyoming, two condominiums, two automobiles,a mobile home, a diamond ring, various firearms, cash, several bank accounts, and a number of cashier's and traveler'schecks. App. 155-164. One check was forfeited as a substi-tute asset.Id., at 162. Libretti filed an appeal from theorder of forfeiture.While this appeal was pending, the District Court entertained third-party claims to some of the property orderedforfeited. See 21 U. S. C. $ 853(n). Following a March 1993hearing, the court amended its forfeiture order to return certain property to the third-party claimants. The court alsomodified its order with respect to Libretti, stating that "itmay be unjust to enforce the specific forfeiture provisions inthe plea agreement" and reasoning that Libretti's concessionto forfeiture in the plea agreement provided insufficient basisfor the order of forfeiture. App. 309. The court ordered aMagistrate to conduct a hearing at which Libretti would begiven the opportunity to show, by a preponderance of theevidence, that any portion of his property was not subject toforfeiture. Upon motion by the Government, the DistrictCourt stayed the proceedings before the Magistrate Judgepending resolution of Libretti's appeal.The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit rejected bothof Libretti's challenges to the forfeiture order. 38 F. 3d 523(1994). The court ruled first that the District Court lackedjurisdiction to consider Libretti's claims to the property ordered forfeited at the third-party hearing, because Librettihad filed a notice of appeal. After noting the divergence inthe Courts of Appeals regarding the applicability of Rule11(f) to forfeiture provisions in plea agreements, the courtrejected Libretti's contention that Rule 11(f) requires a district court to ascertain a factual basis for a stipulated forfeiture of assets. This conclusion, the Court of Appeals reasoned, follows from the fact that forfeiture "is a part of the516us1$$5J 10-22-98 10:36:31 PAGES OPINPGT37Cite as: 516 U. S. 29 (1995)Opinion of the Courtsentence, not a part of the substantive offense." Id., at 528.The Court of Appeals also determined that Libretti hadwaived his Rule 31(e) right to a jury determination of forfeit-ability, despite the fact that the District Court did not expressly advise Libretti of the existence and scope of thatright during his plea colloquy.Id., at 530-531.

Absent such a finding, Libretti argues,even his concession to forfeiture in the plea agreement can-not authorize the forfeiture.ALibretti's first claim is that the Rule by its very termsapplies to a forfeiture provision contained in a plea agreement. Accordingly, our analysis must begin with the textof Rule 11(f ):"Determining Accuracy of Plea. Notwithstanding theacceptance of a plea of guilty, the court should not entera judgment upon such plea without making such inquiryas shall satisfy it that there is a factual basis for theplea."By its plain terms, the Rule applies only to a "plea of guilty."Our precedent makes clear that this language refers to adefendant's admission of guilt of a substantive criminal of-fense as charged in an indictment and his waiver of the rightto a jury determination on that charge. See, e. g., UnitedStates v. Broce, 488 U. S. 563, 570 (1989) ("By entering a pleaof guilty, the accused is not simply stating that he did thediscrete acts described in the indictment; he is admittingguilt of a substantive crime"); North Carolina v. Alford, 400U. S. 25, 32 (1970);Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U. S. 238, 242(1969); McCarthy v. United States, 394 U. S. 459, 466 (1969).With this definition in mind, we have held that a districtjudge satisfies the requirements of Rule 11(f) when he "determine[s] `that the conduct which the defendant admits con-stitutes the offense charged in the indictment or informationor an offense included therein to which the defendant haspleaded guilty.' "Id., at 467 (quoting Advisory Committee'sNotes on Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11, 18 U. S. C. App., p. 730).A forfeiture provision embodied in a plea agreement is ofan entirely different nature. Forfeiture is an element of the516us1$$5J 10-22-98 10:36:31 PAGES OPINPGT39Cite as: 516 U. S. 29 (1995)Opinion of the Courtsentence imposed following conviction or, as here, a plea ofguilty, and thus falls outside the scope of Rule 11(f ). Thetext of the relevant statutory provisions makes clear thatCongress conceived of forfeiture as punishment for the commission of various drug and racketeering crimes. A personconvicted of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise"shall besentenced . . . to the forfeiture prescribed in section853." 21 U. S. C. $ 848(a) (emphasis added). Forfeiture isimposed "in addition to any othersentence." 21 U. S. C.$ 853(a) (emphasis added). See also 18 U. S. C. $ 1963 (for-feiture is imposed "in addition to any othersentence" for aviolation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO)). The legislative history of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98-473, Tit. II,98 Stat. 1976, also characterizes criminal forfeiture as punishment. See, e. g., S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 193 (1983) (criminal forfeiture "is imposed as a sanction against the defendantupon his conviction"). Congress plainly intended forfeitureof assets to operate as punishment for criminal conduct inviolation of the federal drug and racketeering laws, not as aseparate substantive offense.Our precedents have likewise characterized criminal forfeiture as an aspect of punishment imposed following conviction of a substantive criminal offense. In Alexander v.United States, 509 U. S. 544 (1993), we observed that thecriminal forfeiture authorized by the RICO forfeiture statute"is clearly a form of monetary punishment no different, forEighth Amendment purposes, from a traditional `fine.' " Id.,at 558. Similarly, in United States v. $8,850, 461 U. S. 555(1983), we recognized that a "criminal proceeding . . . mayoften include forfeiture as part of the sentence." Id., at 567.And in Austin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602 (1993), we concluded that even the in rem civil forfeiture authorized by 21U. S. C. $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) is punitive in nature, so thatforfeiture imposed under those subsections is subject to thelimitations of the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines516us1$$5J 10-22-98 10:36:31 PAGES OPINPGT40 LIBRETTI v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtClause. 509 U. S., at 619-622. Libretti himself concededbelow that criminal forfeiture "is a part of the sentence, nota part of the substantive offense." 38 F. 3d, at 528.It is true, as Libretti points out, that we said inCaplin &Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U. S. 617 (1989),that "forfeiture is a substantive charge in the indictmentagainst a defendant."Id., at 628, n. 5. That statement responded to the defendant's claim that his Sixth Amendmentright to counsel "for his defense" could be transformed intoa defense to a forfeiture count in the indictment. We in-tended only to suggest that a defendant cannot escape anotherwise appropriate forfeiture sanction by pointing to hisneed for counsel to represent him on the underlying charges.Elsewhere in that opinion we recognized that forfeiture is a"criminal sanction," id., at 634, and is imposed as a sentenceunder $ 853, id., at 620, n. 1.Libretti nonetheless insists that the criminal forfeiture forwhich $ 853 provides is not "simply" an aspect of sentencing,but is, in essence, a hybrid that shares elements of both asubstantive charge and a punishment imposed for criminalactivity. In support of this contention, Libretti points tothree Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that, according tohim, treat forfeiture as a substantive criminal charge. Rule7(c)(2) provides that "[n]o judgment of forfeiture may be entered in a criminal proceeding unless the indictment or theinformation shall allege the extent of the interest or property subject to forfeiture." If the indictment or informationalleges that a defendant's property is subject to forfeiture,"a special verdict shall be returned as to the extent of theinterest or property subject to forfeiture, if any." Fed. RuleCrim. Proc. 31(e). And a finding of forfeitability must beembodied in a judgment. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32(d)(2)("When a verdict contains a finding of criminal forfeiture,the judgment must authorize the Attorney General to seizethe interest or property subject to forfeiture on terms thatthe court considers proper").516us1$$5J 10-22-98 10:36:31 PAGES OPINPGT41Cite as: 516 U. S. 29 (1995)Opinion of the CourtAlthough the procedural safeguards generated by theseRules are unique in the realm of sentencing, they do notchange the fundamental nature of criminal forfeiture. Thefact that the Rules attach heightened procedural protectionsto imposition of criminal forfeiture as punishment for certaintypes of criminal conduct cannot alter the simple factthat forfeiture is precisely that: punishment. The AdvisoryCommittee's "assumption" that "the amount of the interestor property subject to criminal forfeiture is an element ofthe offense to be alleged and proved," Advisory Committee'sNotes on Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 31, 18 U. S. C. App., p. 786,does not persuade us otherwise. The Committee's assumption runs counter to the weighty authority discussed above,all of which indicates that criminal forfeiture is an elementof the sentence imposed for a violation of certain drug andracketeering laws. Moreover, even supposing that the Committee's assumption is authoritative evidence with respect tothe amendments to Rules 7, 31, and 32, it has no bearing onthe proper construction of Rule 11. Tome v. United States,513 U. S. 150 (1995), is not to the contrary. TheTome plural-ity treated the Advisory Committee's Notes on Federal Ruleof Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) as relevant evidence of the drafters'intent as to the meaning of that Rule. 513 U. S., at 160-163. In contrast, Libretti seeks to use the Note appendedto Rule 31 to elucidate the meaning of an entirely distinctRule. We cannot agree that the Advisory Committee'sNotes on the 1972 amendment to Rule 31(e) shed any particular light on the meaning of the language of Rule 11(f), whichwas added by amendment to Rule 11 in 1966.BLibretti next advances three policy arguments for con-struing Rule 11(f) to reach asset forfeiture provisions of pleaagreements. First, he claims, Rule 11(f )'s factual basis in-quiry is essential to ensuring that a forfeiture agreement isknowing and voluntary. Next, Libretti declares that a Rule516us1$$5J 10-22-98 10:36:31 PAGES OPINPGT42 LIBRETTI v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court11(f) inquiry will protect against Government overreaching.And lastly, Libretti insists that a factual basis inquiry is necessary to ensure that the rights of third-party claimants arefully protected. We consider these contentions in turn.We are unpersuaded that the Rule 11(f ) inquiry is necessary to guarantee that a forfeiture agreement is knowing andvoluntary. Whether a stipulated asset forfeiture is "factually based" is a distinct inquiry from the question whetherthe defendant entered an agreement to forfeit assets knowingly and voluntarily. Libretti correctly points out thatRule 11(f ) is intended to ensure that a defendant's "plea ofguilty" is knowing and voluntary. McCarthy, 394 U. S., at472 (the Rule 11 inquiry is "designed to facilitate a moreaccurate determination of the voluntariness of [a] plea");Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11, 18U. S. C. App., p. 730 (Rule 11(f ) protects defendants who donot "realiz[e] that [their] conduct does not actually fall withinthe charge"). But a "plea of guilty" and a forfeiture provision contained in a plea agreement are different mattersaltogether. Forfeiture, as we have said, is a part of thesentence. If the voluntariness of a defendant's concessionto imposition of a particular sentence is questionable, therelevant inquiry is whether the sentencing stipulation wasinformed and uncoerced on the part of the defendant, notwhether it is factually sound.Libretti's second argument--that a Rule 11(f ) factual basisinquiry is necessary to prevent prosecutorial overreaching--proves equally unavailing. As Libretti properly observes,$ 853 limits forfeiture by establishing a factual nexus requirement: Only drug-tainted assets may be forfeited. Libretti suggests that failure to ensure, by means of a Rule11(f) inquiry, that this factual nexus exists will open the doorto voluntary forfeiture agreements that exceed the forfeitureauthorized by statute, particularly in light of the Government's direct financial interest in forfeiture as a source ofrevenue and the disparity in bargaining power between the516us1$$5J 10-22-98 10:36:31 PAGES OPINPGT43Cite as: 516 U. S. 29 (1995)Opinion of the CourtGovernment and a defendant. We recognized in Caplin &Drysdale that the broad forfeiture provisions carry the potential for Government abuse and "can be devastating whenused unjustly." 491 U. S., at 634. Nonetheless, we concluded that "[c]ases involving particular abuses can be dealtwith individually by the lower courts, when (and if) any suchcases arise."Id., at 635. However valid Libretti's concernabout prosecutorial overreaching may be, Rule 11(f ) simplydoes not, on its face, address it.We do not mean to suggest that a district court mustsimply accept a defendant's agreement to forfeit property,particularly when that agreement is not accompanied by astipulation of facts supporting forfeiture, or when the trialjudge for other reasons finds the agreement problematic. Inthis regard, we note that the Department of Justice recentlyissued a Revised Policy Regarding Forfeiture by Settlementand Plea Bargaining in Civil and Criminal Actions, Directive94-7 (Nov. 1994), to instruct that, among the proceduresnecessary to ensure a valid forfeiture agreement, "[t]he settlement to forfeit property must be in writing and the defendant must concede facts supporting the forfeiture." Id.,at 13. In this case, however, we need not determine theprecise scope of a district court's independent obligation, ifany, to inquire into the propriety of a stipulated asset forfeiture embodied in a plea agreement. We note that the Sentencing Guidelines direct only that a district court "may" accept an agreement reached by the parties as to a specific,appropriate sentence, as long as the sentence is within theapplicable guideline range or departs from that range "forjustifiable reasons." United States Sentencing Commission,Guidelines Manual $ 6B1.2(c)(2) (Nov. 1993). Libretti's pleaagreement correctly recognized that the District Court wasnot bound by the parties' agreement as to the appropriatesentence: "[T]he sentencing judge is neither a party to norbound by this plea agreement and is free to impose whateversentence he feels is justified." App. 81, || 11.516us1$$5J 10-22-98 10:36:31 PAGES OPINPGT44 LIBRETTI v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtLibretti finally argues that a Rule 11(f) factual basis in-quiry is essential to preserving third-party claimants' rights.A defendant who has no interest in particular assets, theargument goes, will have little if any incentive to resist forfeiture of those assets, even if there is no statutory basis fortheir forfeiture. Once the Government has secured a stipulation as to forfeitability, third-party claimants can establishtheir entitlement to return of the assets only by means of thehearing afforded under 21 U. S. C. $ 853(n). This hearing,Libretti claims, is inadequate to safeguard third-partyrights, since the entry of a forfeiture order deprives third-party claimants of the right to a jury trial and reverses theburden of proof. He concludes that insisting on a factualbasis inquiry before entry of the forfeiture order will lessenthe need for third-party hearings following a broad-rangingforfeiture agreement, and may even result in the conservation of scarce judicial resources. Whatever the merits ofthis argument as a matter of policy, Congress has determined that $ 853(n), rather than Rule 11(f ), provides themeans by which third-party rights must be vindicated.Third-party claimants are not party to Rule 11(f ) proceed-ings, and Libretti's assertion that their interests are bestprotected therein fits poorly within our adversary systemof justice.CContrary to the suggestion of the dissent, post, at 57, theDistrict Court did not rest its forfeiture order on nothingmore than Libretti's stipulation that certain assets were for-feitable. In fact, there is ample evidence that the DistrictCourt both understood the statutory requisites for criminalforfeiture and concluded that they were satisfied on the factsof this case at the time the sentence was imposed. First,the District Judge correctly recognized the factual nexusrequirement established by $ 853. App. 89 (change-of-pleahearing) ("[I]t has to be the product of a drug transaction tobe forfeited"). Count 6 of the indictment specified numerous516us1$$5J 10-22-98 10:36:31 PAGES OPINPGT45Cite as: 516 U. S. 29 (1995)Opinion of the Courtitems of property alleged to be subject to forfeiture underthat statute, including a parcel of real property in Wyoming;two automobiles; over $100,000 in cash proceeds from drugtransactions; $12,000 in cash that Libretti had stored insidea paint can at his home; a diamond ring; "[a]ll United Statescurrency and travelers checks" recovered from Libretti'sstorage lockers, safes, home, and person; a mobile home; acomputer system; four bank accounts; two GNMA invest-ment certificates; bonds; three cashier's checks; and the contents of two safe deposit boxes. Additional property wasidentified in a bill of particulars and a restraining order issued, and subsequently amended, by the District Court pursuant to 21 U. S. C. $ 853(e) ("Upon application of the UnitedStates, the court may enter a restraining order . . . to preserve the availability of property described in subsection (a)of this section for forfeiture under this section"). After oneweek of trial, the parties submitted to the court an agreement which set out, in detail, specific items of property to beforfeited following Libretti's plea of guilty, including "all realestate; all personal property, including guns, the computer,and every other item now in the possession of the UnitedStates; all bank accounts, investments, retirement accounts,cash, cashier's checks, travelers checks and funds of anykind." App. 81. The plea agreement also explained thatthe maximum penalty for the offense to which Librettiagreed to plead guilty included "forfeiture of all knownassets as prescribed in 21 U. S. C. $ 853 and assets which arediscovered at any later time up to $1,500,000." App. 79.Before issuing the order of forfeiture, the trial judge listened to four days of testimony, in which Government witnesses detailed numerous drug transactions with Libretti.See, e. g., 2 Tr. 124-126, 137-139; 3 id., at 271-272; 4 id., at495-501; 5 id., at 946-949. One witness recounted Libretti'spurchase of a home in 1985 with a $100,000 down payment,at a time during which he was earning an annual salary ofapproximately $20,000. 2 id., at 179-180, 210-216; App. 123516us1$$5J 10-22-98 10:36:31 PAGES OPINPGT46 LIBRETTI v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court(Presentence Report, Prosecutor's Statement || 6); Presen-tence Report || 37. Another told of Libretti's purchase of asports car with a check for $19,114. 5 Tr. 907-913. Otherwitnesses described Libretti's possession, in his capacity asa federal firearms dealer, of numerous automatic and semiautomatic firearms, later determined to be worth at least$243,000. See,e. g., 2 id., at 140-141, 156-162; 5 id., at 844-853; App. 123 (Presentence Report, Prosecutor's Statement|| 9). One witness testified that Libretti admitted having"quite a bit of money stashed away" in safe deposit boxes,5 Tr. 834, and on at least one occasion had "a couple thousand" dollars in cash "sitting around," id., at 835. Otherwitnesses established that Libretti often stored cash anddrugs in safe deposit boxes and storage facilities away fromhis home. See, e. g., 2 id., at 155-156; 4 id., at 718-720, 738-743. One of Libretti's drug customers testified that hebroke into a storage facility at which Libretti had rented astorage locker and discovered a briefcase containing a largeamount of cash (later estimated in the presentence report tobe approximately $150,000), a large block of cocaine, and fivelarge trash bags, at least one of which was filled with marijuana. Id., at 558-566, 588-589.Prior to sentencing, the court received the presentence investigation report, which contained, among other things, asummary of Libretti's legitimate income during the relevanttime periods. During 1985 and 1986, Libretti worked as arestaurant and grocery store manager, earning approximately $20,000 per year. In early 1987, he was employed asa temporary stock broker and was paid on commission only.Later that year, he managed a Tenneco thrift store. In1989, Libretti reported an income of approximately $50,000from his firearms business. During 1988 and 1989, Librettialso owned a partnership interest in two condominiums; hereported that the rental income did not meet his expensesand thus he did not earn a profit. Between June 1989 andhis arrest in December 1991, Libretti worked as a full-time516us1$$5J 10-22-98 10:36:31 PAGES OPINPGT47Cite as: 516 U. S. 29 (1995)Opinion of the Courtaccounting supervisor, earning a salary of approximately$40,000 per year. Presentence Report |||| 35-37.Included in the presentence report was a prosecutor'sstatement detailing the amounts of cocaine and marijuanainvolved in Libretti's drug operation and various sums ofmoney Libretti earned from his drug dealing. App. 122-135. The statement described Libretti's substantial expenditures, including the $100,000 cash deposit on a house in 1985($72,000 of which was derived from Libretti's sale of drugs)and the purchase of a $20,000 mortgage in 1986 (again, alleg-edly with proceeds from his distribution of drugs).Id., at123. Paragraph 12 reported that Libretti had opened a safedeposit box in 1987 in which he placed $48,000 in cash. Onanother occasion, Libretti placed approximately $10,000 intoan account bearing his brother's name. Id., at 124-125.The statement described Libretti's practice of storing largeamounts of cash and drugs in safes, storage lockers, and safedeposit boxes. Id., at 124, 129. Libretti also stored drugs,a weapon, and a cashier's check for $65,000 in his personallocker at his place of employment. Id., at 129. The statement related Libretti's investment of at least $243,000 in numerous firearms. Id., at 123-124. These funds again reportedly derived from Libretti's drug distribution activities;the statement indicated that "Libretti's gun business wasused to launder drug proceeds" and served as a means bywhich Libretti could "justify his income since [he] was notworking at times during the conspiracy and, when he wasworking, was not bringing in the money that would pay forthe Lakewood house and other investments." Id., at 127.Finally, the statement suggested that substantial sums ofcash derived from Libretti's drug activities were never recovered by law enforcement authorities. Id., at 134. Defense counsel conceded at the sentencing hearing that "the[presentence] report of Mr. Libretti's background, education,financial circumstances are [sic] accurate." Id., at 138. Inlight of these facts, defense counsel acknowledged that "the516us1$$5J 10-22-98 10:36:31 PAGES OPINPGT48 LIBRETTI v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtforfeiture is going to take regular money and illegal moneyunder the substitute assets" provision of $ 853. Id., at 149.In view of the plea agreement, the indictment, and theamended restraining order, the trial judge issued an orderforfeiting to the Government the Wyoming lot, both condo-miniums, both automobiles, $8,000 in cash proceeds of Libretti's drug transactions, the diamond ring, the mobile home, allfirearms, an IRA account, three bank accounts, bonds, twoGNMA certificates, and several cashier's and traveler'schecks. One check was ordered forfeited as a substituteasset "for assets dissipated and otherwise expended by Li-bretti."Id., at 162.It is not, as Libretti maintains, implausible that the courtconcluded on the record before it that the forfeiture orderwas appropriate. Following Libretti's objection to the forfeiture order for lack of factual foundation, the trial judgereplied that "the evidence that I heard before me in the two[sic] days of trial I think is sufficient to warrant the grantingof forfeiture."Id., at 154. We cannot say that the DistrictJudge, despite his subsequent uncertainty, erred in issuingthe forfeiture order on the facts before him.IIILibretti also challenges the adequacy of his waiver of ajury determination as to the forfeitability of his propertyunder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 31(e). The right,he argues, has both a constitutional and a statutory foundation, and cannot be waived absent specific advice from thedistrict court as to the nature and scope of this right and anexpress, written agreement to forgo the jury determinationon forfeitability. We disagree.Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 31(e) provides that,"[i]f the indictment or the information alleges that an interest or property is subject to criminal forfeiture, a specialverdict shall be returned as to the extent of the interest orproperty subject to forfeiture, if any." Libretti would have516us1$$5J 10-22-98 10:36:31 PAGES OPINPGT49Cite as: 516 U. S. 29 (1995)Opinion of the Courtus equate this statutory right to a jury determination of for-feitability with the familiar Sixth Amendment right to a jurydetermination of guilt or innocence. See, e. g., United Statesv.Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 511 (1995) ("The Constitution givesa criminal defendant the right to demand that a jury findhim guilty of all the elements of the crime with which he ischarged"). Without disparaging the importance of the rightprovided by Rule 31(e), our analysis of the nature of criminalforfeiture as an aspect of sentencing compels the conclusionthat the right to a jury verdict on forfeitability does not fallwithin the Sixth Amendment's constitutional protection.Our cases have made abundantly clear that a defendant doesnot enjoy a constitutional right to a jury determination asto the appropriate sentence to be imposed. See, e. g.,McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 93 (1986) ("[T]hereis no Sixth Amendment right to jury sentencing, even wherethe sentence turns on specific findings of fact"); Cabana v.Bullock, 474 U. S. 376, 385 (1986) ("The decision whethera particular punishment . . . is appropriate in any givencase is not one that we have ever required to be made by ajury"); Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U. S. 447, 459 (1984) (noright to a jury determination as to the imposition of thedeath penalty).Given that the right to a jury determination of forfeitability is merely statutory in origin, we do not accept Libretti'ssuggestion that the plea agreement must make specific reference to Rule 31(e). Nor must the district court specificallyadvise a defendant that a plea of guilty will result in waiverof the Rule 31(e) right. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure11(c) details the information a district court must communicate to a defendant in order to ensure that a guilty plea isvalid. Advisory Committee's Notes on 1974 Amendment ofFed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(c), 18 U. S. C. App., p. 731 (the Rule"codifies . . . the requirements of Boykin v. Alabama, 395U. S. 238 . . . (1969), which held that a defendant must beapprised of the fact that he relinquishes certain constitu516us1$$5J 10-22-98 10:36:31 PAGES OPINPGT50 LIBRETTI v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courttional rights by pleading guilty") (emphasis added). Spe-cific advice regarding the Rule 31(e) right is not among theRule 11(c) safeguards, and we decline Libretti's invitationto expand upon the required plea colloquy. That is not tosay, however, that a trial judge may not mention the natureand scope of the Rule 31(e) right during a plea colloquy. Infact, the Advisory Committee's Notes make plain that "ajudge is free to" inform a defendant about specific conse-quences that might follow from a plea of guilty if the judge"feels a consequence of a plea of guilty in a particular case islikely to be of real significance to the defendant." AdvisoryCommittee's Notes on 1974 Amendment of Fed. Rule Crim.Proc. 11, 18 U. S. C. App., p. 731.On these facts, Libretti's waiver of a jury determinationas to the scope of forfeiture was plainly adequate. In theplea agreement, Libretti "acknowledge[d] that by pleadingguilty to Count Six of the Indictment, he waive[d] variousconstitutional rights, including the right to a jury trial and aspeedy trial." App. 80. He stipulated to the forfeiture ofspecific assets. Id., at 80-81. The District Court engagedLibretti in an extensive colloquy at his change-of-plea hearing, during which the court reviewed with Libretti the consequences of his guilty plea, including the fact that the pleawould result in dismissal of the jury. Libretti's responsesmade clear that he fully understood the nature and consequences of his guilty plea and was prepared to be sentencedin accordance with the plea agreement. At the sentencinghearing, neither Libretti nor his counsel specifically objectedto resolution of forfeiture issues by the court without a jury.See, e. g., id., at 150, 154.In addition, Libretti was represented by counsel at allstages of trial and sentencing. Apart from the small classof rights that require specific advice from the court underRule 11(c), it is the responsibility of defense counsel toinform a defendant of the advantages and disadvantages ofa plea agreement and the attendant statutory and con516us1$$5J 10-22-98 10:36:31 PAGES OPINPGT51Cite as: 516 U. S. 29 (1995)Opinion of the Courtstitutional rights that a guilty plea would forgo. Librettihas made no claim of ineffectiveness of counsel before thisCourt. As we noted in Broce, "[a] failure by counsel to pro-vide advice may form the basis of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, but absent such a claim it cannot serveas the predicate for setting aside a valid plea." 488 U. S.,at 574.Of course, a district judge must not mislead a defendantregarding the procedures to be followed in determiningwhether the forfeiture contemplated in a plea agreement willbe imposed, nor should the court permit a defendant's obvi-ous confusion about those procedures to stand uncorrected.On this record, however, we find no hint that Libretti laboredunder any misapprehension. Although the District Judgedid not spell out for Libretti that, had he declined to enter aplea of guilty, and had the trial gone forward, the jury wouldeventually have been required to determine which of Libret-ti's assets were forfeitable, when viewed in its entirety, theplea colloquy made it abundantly clear that the plea agree-ment would end any proceedings before the jury and wouldlead directly to sentencing by the court. As the Court ofAppeals observed, "there is no evidence at [the change-ofplea] hearing that [Libretti] wanted a jury trial on the for-feiture issue, or thought he was going to have one." 38F. 3d, at 531. Taken together, the plea agreement and theplea colloquy waived Libretti's right to insist on a jury determination of forfeitability under Rule 31(e).IVFor these reasons, we reject Libretti's challenges to theDistrict Court's forfeiture order. Under the plain languageof Rule 11(f ), the District Court is not obliged to inquire intothe factual basis for a stipulated forfeiture of assets embodied in a plea agreement. And because Libretti agreed tothis forfeiture and waived his "right to a jury trial," he cannot now complain that he did not receive the special jury516us1$$5J 10-22-98 10:36:31 PAGES OPINPGT52 LIBRETTI v. UNITED STATESOpinion of Souter, J.verdict on forfeitability for which Rule 31(e) provides. Ac-cordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
