Charles Hardy was Forklift's president.The Magistrate found that, throughout Harris' time atForklift, Hardy often insulted her because of her gender andoften made her the target of unwanted sexual innuendos.Hardy told Harris on several occasions, in the presence ofother employees, "You're a woman, what do you know" and"We need a man as the rental manager"; at least once, hetold her she was "a dumb ass woman." App. to Pet. forCert. A-13. Again in front of others, he suggested that thetwo of them "go to the Holiday Inn to negotiate [Harris']raise." Id., at A-14. Hardy occasionally asked Harris andother female employees to get coins from his front pantspocket. Ibid. He threw objects on the ground in front ofHarris and other women, and asked them to pick the objectsup. Id., at A-14 to A-15. He made sexual innuendos aboutHarris' and other women's clothing. Id., at A-15.In mid-August 1987, Harris complained to Hardy about hisconduct. Hardy said he was surprised that Harris was offended, claimed he was only joking, and apologized. Id., atA-16. He also promised he would stop, and based on thisassurance Harris stayed on the job. Ibid. But in earlySeptember, Hardy began anew: While Harris was arranginga deal with one of Forklift's customers, he asked her, againin front of other employees, "What did you do, promisethe guy . . . some [sex] Saturday night?" Id., at A-17. OnOctober 1, Harris collected her paycheck and quit.Harris then sued Forklift, claiming that Hardy's conducthad created an abusive work environment for her because ofher gender. The United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, adopting the report and recom510us1$$4Z 06-18-97 16:34:48 PAGES OPINPGT20 HARRIS v. FORKLIFT SYSTEMS, INC.Opinion of the Courtmendation of the Magistrate, found this to be "a close case,"id., at A-31, but held that Hardy's conduct did not create anabusive environment. The court found that some of Hardy'scomments "offended [Harris], and would offend the reasonable woman," id., at A-33, but that they were not"so severe as to be expected to seriously affect [Harris']psychological well-being. A reasonable woman manager under like circumstances would have been offendedby Hardy, but his conduct would not have risen to thelevel of interfering with that person's work performance."Neither do I believe that [Harris] was subjectively sooffended that she suffered injury . . . . Although Hardymay at times have genuinely offended [Harris], I do notbelieve that he created a working environment so poisoned as to be intimidating or abusive to [Harris]." Id.,at A-34 to A-35.In focusing on the employee's psychological well-being, theDistrict Court was following Circuit precedent. See Rabidue v. Osceola Refining Co., 805 F. 2d 611, 620 (CA6 1986),cert. denied, 481 U. S. 1041 (1987). The United States Courtof Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed in a brief unpublished decision. Judgt. order reported at 976 F. 2d 733 (1992).We granted certiorari, 507 U. S. 959 (1993), to resolve aconflict among the Circuits on whether conduct, to be actionable as "abusive work environment" harassment (no quid proquo harassment issue is present here), must "seriously affect[an employee's] psychological well-being" or lead the plaintiffto "suffe[r] injury." Compare Rabidue (requiring seriouseffect on psychological well-being); Vance v. Southern BellTelephone & Telegraph Co., 863 F. 2d 1503, 1510 (CA11 1989)(same); and Downes v. FAA, 775 F. 2d 288, 292 (CA Fed.1985) (same), with Ellison v. Brady, 924 F. 2d 872, 877-878(CA9 1991) (rejecting such a requirement).510us1$$4Z 06-18-97 16:34:48 PAGES OPINPGT21Cite as: 510 U. S. 17 (1993)Opinion of the CourtIITitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it "an un-lawful employment practice for an employer . . . to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because ofsuch individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1). As we made clear inMeritorSavings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57 (1986), this language "is not limited to `economic' or `tangible' discrimina-tion. The phrase `terms, conditions, or privileges of employment' evinces a congressional intent `to strike at the entirespectrum of disparate treatment of men and women' in employment," which includes requiring people to work in a dis-criminatorily hostile or abusive environment.Id., at 64,quoting Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart,435 U. S. 702, 707, n. 13 (1978) (some internal quotationmarks omitted). When the workplace is permeated with"discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult," 477 U. S.,at 65, that is "sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter theconditions of the victim's employment and create an abusiveworking environment,"id., at 67 (internal brackets and quo-tation marks omitted), Title VII is violated.This standard, which we reaffirm today, takes a middlepath between making actionable any conduct that is merelyoffensive and requiring the conduct to cause a tangible psy-chological injury. As we pointed out inMeritor, "mere ut-terance of an . . . epithet which engenders offensive feelingsin a employee," ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted) doesnot sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII. Conduct that is not severe or pervasiveenough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work envi-ronment--an environment that a reasonable person wouldfind hostile or abusive--is beyond Title VII's purview. Like-wise, if the victim does not subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive, the conduct has not actually altered the510us1$$4Z 06-18-97 16:34:48 PAGES OPINPGT22 HARRIS v. FORKLIFT SYSTEMS, INC.Opinion of the Courtconditions of the victim's employment, and there is no TitleVII violation.But Title VII comes into play before the harassing conductleads to a nervous breakdown. A discriminatorily abusivework environment, even one that does not seriously affectemployees' psychological well-being, can and often willdetract from employees' job performance, discourage employees from remaining on the job, or keep them from advancing in their careers. Moreover, even without regard tothese tangible effects, the very fact that the discriminatoryconduct was so severe or pervasive that it created a workenvironment abusive to employees because of their race,gender, religion, or national origin offends Title VII's broadrule of workplace equality. The appalling conduct allegedin Meritor, and the reference in that case to environments" `so heavily polluted with discrimination as to destroy completely the emotional and psychological stability of minoritygroup workers,' " id., at 66, quoting Rogers v. EEOC, 454F. 2d 234, 238 (CA5 1971), cert. denied, 406 U. S. 957 (1972),merely present some especially egregious examples ofharassment. They do not mark the boundary of what isactionable.We therefore believe the District Court erred in relyingon whether the conduct "seriously affect[ed] plaintiff 's psychological well-being" or led her to "suffe[r] injury." Suchan inquiry may needlessly focus the factfinder's attention onconcrete psychological harm, an element Title VII does notrequire. Certainly Title VII bars conduct that would seriously affect a reasonable person's psychological well-being,but the statute is not limited to such conduct. So long asthe environment would reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive, Meritor, supra, at 67, there isno need for it also to be psychologically injurious.This is not, and by its nature cannot be, a mathematicallyprecise test. We need not answer today all the potential510us1$$4Z 06-18-97 16:34:48 PAGES OPINPGT23Cite as: 510 U. S. 17 (1993)Opinion of the Courtquestions it raises, nor specifically address the Equal Em-ployment Opportunity Commission's new regulations onthis subject, see 58 Fed. Reg. 51266 (1993) (proposed 29CFR $$ 1609.1, 1609.2); see also 29 CFR $ 1604.11 (1993).But we can say that whether an environment is "hostile"or "abusive" can be determined only by looking at all thecircumstances. These may include the frequency of thediscriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physicallythreatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance;and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee'swork performance. The effect on the employee's psycholog-ical well-being is, of course, relevant to determining whetherthe plaintiff actually found the environment abusive. Butwhile psychological harm, like any other relevant factor, maybe taken into account, no single factor is required.IIIForklift, while conceding that a requirement that the con-duct seriously affect psychological well-being is unfounded,argues that the District Court nonetheless correctly appliedtheMeritor standard. We disagree. Though the DistrictCourt did conclude that the work environment was not "intimidating or abusive to [Harris]," App. to Pet. for Cert.A-35, it did so only after finding that the conduct was not"so severe as to be expected to seriously affect plaintiff 'spsychological well-being,"id., at A-34, and that Harris wasnot "subjectively so offended that she suffered injury," ibid.The District Court's application of these incorrect standardsmay well have influenced its ultimate conclusion, especiallygiven that the court found this to be a "close case," id., atA-31.We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case for further proceedings consist-ent with this opinion.
