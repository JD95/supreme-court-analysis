In Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302 (1989) (Penry I), weheld that the Texas capital sentencing scheme provided aconstitutionally inadequate vehicle for jurors to consider andgive effect to the mitigating evidence of mental retardationand childhood abuse the petitioner had presented. The petitioner in this case argues that the same scheme was inadequate for jurors to give effect to his evidence of low intelligence. The Texas courts rejected his claim, and a FederalDistrict Court denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.We conclude that "reasonable jurists would find the districtcourt's assessment of the constitutional claims debatable orwrong," Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 484 (2000), andtherefore hold that a certificate of appealability should haveissued.IPetitioner Robert Tennard was convicted by a jury of capital murder in October 1986. The evidence presented at trialindicated that Tennard and two accomplices killed two of hisneighbors and robbed their house. Tennard himself stabbedone of the victims to death, and one of the accomplices killedthe other victim with a hatchet.*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the AmericanAssociation on Mental Retardation et al. by James W.

S. 274 (2004)Opinion of the CourtDuring the penalty phase of the trial, defense counselcalled only one witness--Tennard's parole officer--who testified that Tennard's Department of Corrections record from aprior incarceration indicated that he had an IQ of 67. App.28-29. He testified that the IQ test would have been admin-istered as a matter of course. Ibid. The report, which indicated that Tennard was 17 years old at the time it was pre-pared, was admitted into evidence. On cross-examination,the parole officer testified that he did not know who hadadministered the test.Id., at 30. The government intro-duced evidence in the penalty phase regarding a prior conviction for rape, committed when Tennard was 16. The rapevictim testified that she had escaped through a window afterTennard permitted her to go to the bathroom to take a bath,promising him she would not run away. Id., at 16-17.The jury was instructed to consider the appropriate pun-ishment by answering the two "special issues" used at thetime in Texas to establish whether a sentence of life impris-onment or death would be imposed:"Was the conduct of the defendant, Robert James Ten-nard, that caused the death of the deceased committeddeliberately and with the reasonable expectation thatthe death of the deceased or another would result?"Id., at 69 (the "deliberateness special issue")."Is there a probability that the defendant, RobertJames Tennard, would commit criminal acts of violencethat would constitute a continuing threat to society?"Id., at 70 (the "future dangerousness special issue").In his penalty phase closing argument, defense counsel re-lied on both the IQ score and the rape victim's testimony tosuggest that Tennard's limited mental faculties and gulliblenature mitigated his culpability:"Tennard has got a 67 IQ. The same guy that told thispoor unfortunate woman [the rape victim] that was trying to work that day, `Well, if I let you in there, will you542US2 Unit: $U68 [11-01-06 18:17:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN278 TENNARD v. DRETKEOpinion of the Courtleave?' And he believed her. This guy with the 67 IQ,and she goes in and, sure enough, she escapes, just likeshe should have. That is uncontroverted testimony be-fore you, that we have got a man before us that has gotan intelligence quotient . . . that is that low." Id., at 51.In rebuttal, the prosecution suggested that the low IQevidence was simply irrelevant to the question of mitigation:"But whether he has a low IQ or not is not really theissue. Because the legislature, in asking you to addressthat question [the future dangerousness special issue],the reasons why he became a danger are not really relevant. The fact that he is a danger, that the evidenceshows he's a danger, is the criteria to use in answeringthat question." Id., at 60.The jury answered both special issues in the affirmative,and Tennard was accordingly sentenced to death.Unsuccessful on direct appeal, Tennard sought state post-conviction relief. He argued that, in light of the instructionsgiven to the jury, his death sentence had been obtained inviolation of the Eighth Amendment as interpreted by thisCourt in Penry I. In that case, we had held that "it is notenough simply to allow the defendant to present mitigatingevidence to the sentencer. The sentencer must also be ableto consider and give effect to that evidence in imposing sentence." Penry I, supra, at 319; see also Penry v. Johnson,532 U. S. 782, 797 (2001)(Penry II) (describing " `give effectto' " language of Penry I as "the key" to that decision). Weconcluded that the same two special issues that were pre-sented to Tennard's jury (plus a third immaterial to the questions now before us) were insufficient for the jury in Penry'scase to consider and give effect to Penry's evidence of mentalretardation and childhood abuse, and therefore ran afoul ofthe Eighth Amendment. Penry I, 492 U. S., at 319-328.His mental retardation evidence, we held, " `had relevance to[his] moral culpability beyond the scope of the [deliberate542US2 Unit: $U68 [11-01-06 18:17:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN279Cite as: 542 U. S. 274 (2004)Opinion of the Courtness] special verdict questio[n]' " because "[p]ersonal culpa-bility is not solely a function of a defendant's capacity toact `deliberately.' " Id., at 322 (some brackets in original).Moreover, because the "evidence concerning Penry's mentalretardation indicated that one effect of his retardation is hisinability to learn from his mistakes," his retardation was relevant to the future dangerousness special issue "only as anaggravating factor." Id., at 323. As to the evidence ofchildhood abuse, we held that the two special issues simplyfailed to "provide a vehicle for the jury to give [it] mitigatingeffect."Id., at 322-324.The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected Tennard'sPenry claim. Ex parte Tennard, 960 S. W. 2d 57 (1997) (enbanc). Writing for a plurality of four, Presiding Judge McCormick observed that the definition of mental retardationadopted in Texas involves three components ("(1) subaveragegeneral intellectual functioning, (2) concurrent deficits inadaptive behavior, and (3) onset during the early development period," id., at 60), and concluded: "[Tennard's] evidence of a low IQ score, standing alone, does not meet thisdefinition. Qualitatively and quantitatively [Tennard's] lowIQ evidence does not approach the level of Johnny Paul Penry's evidence of mental retardation. . . . [W]e find no evidencein this record that applicant is mentally retarded." Id.,at 61.The plurality went on to consider whether Tennard wouldbe entitled to relief under Penry even if his low IQ fell"within Penry's definition of mental retardation." 960 S. W.2d, at 61. It held that he would not. The court explainedthat, unlike the evidence presented in Penry's case, "there isno evidence [that Tennard's] low IQ rendered him unable toappreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct when he committed the offense, or that his low IQ rendered him unableto learn from his mistakes or . . . control his impulses . . . ."Id., at 62. It found there was "no danger" that the jurywould have given the evidence "only aggravating effect in542US2 Unit: $U68 [11-01-06 18:17:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN280 TENNARD v. DRETKEOpinion of the Courtanswering" the future dangerousness special issue, and thatthe low IQ and gullibility evidence was not beyond the jury'seffective reach because the jury "could have used this evi-dence for a `no' answer" to the deliberateness special issue.Ibid.Two judges concurred separately, and wrote that "thisCourt has sustained a Penry claim only when there is evidence of mental retardation. But even in those cases, theevidence of mental retardation was always something morethan what was presented in this case." 960 S. W. 2d, at 64(opinion of Meyers, J.) (citations omitted). Taking a morepermissive view of evidence of impaired intellectual functioning than did the plurality ("[F]or Penry purposes, courtsshould not distinguish between mental retardation and dementia," even though the onset of the latter "may occur afterage eighteen," id., at 65), the concurring judges neverthelessconcluded that "the record does not contain sufficient evidence to support" Tennard's Penry claim. 960 S. W. 2d,at 63. The concurring judges also rejected Tennard's contention that "evidence of an IQ of below 70 alone requires a`Penry instruction' " because published opinions of the Texascourts had uniformly required more. Id., at 67.Judge Baird dissented, maintaining that the Court ofCriminal Appeals had "consistent[ly]" held, in the wake ofPenry I, that "evidence of mental retardation cannot be adequately considered within the statutory" special issues. 960S. W. 2d, at 67. The court had strayed from its precedent,Judge Baird wrote, and instead of asking simply whether thejury had a vehicle for considering the mitigating evidence,had "weigh[ed] the sufficiency of [Tennard's] mitigating evidence." Id., at 70. Judges Overstreet and Womack dissented without opinion. Id., at 63.Tennard sought federal habeas corpus relief. The DistrictCourt denied his petition. Tennard v. Johnson, Civ. ActionNo. H-98-4238 (SD Tex., July 25, 2000), App. 121. Thecourt began by observing that "[e]vidence of a single low542US2 Unit: $U68 [11-01-06 18:17:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN281Cite as: 542 U. S. 274 (2004)Opinion of the Courtscore on an unidentified intelligence test is not evidence thatTennard was mentally retarded."Id., at 128. It then considered whether the 67 IQ score was "within `the effectivereach' of the jury."Ibid. Noting that "Tennard's low IQscore was not concealed from the jury; it was in evidence,and both sides argued its significance for punishment," thecourt concluded that the jury had adequate means, in thetwo special issues, by which to give effect to that mitigat-ing evidence.Id., at 129. The court subsequently deniedTennard a certificate of appealability (COA). Civ. ActionNo. H-98-4238 (SD Tex., Oct. 17, 2000), see App. 2.The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, after fullbriefing and oral argument, issued an opinion holding thatTennard was not entitled to a COA because his Penry claimwas not debatable among jurists of reason. Tennard v.Cockrell, 284 F. 3d 591 (2002). The court began by statingthe test applied in the Fifth Circuit to Penry claims, whichinvolves a threshold inquiry into whether the petitioner presented "constitutionally relevant" mitigating evidence, thatis, evidence of a " `uniquely severe permanent handicap withwhich the defendant was burdened through no fault of hisown,' " and evidence that " `the criminal act was attributableto this severe permanent condition.' " 284 F. 3d, at 595.The court then held that Tennard was not entitled to aCOA, for two reasons: First, it held that evidence of low IQalone does not constitute a uniquely severe condition, andrejected Tennard's claim that his evidence was of mental retardation, not just low IQ, because no evidence had been introduced tying his IQ score to retardation. Id., at 596.Second, it held that even if Tennard's evidence was mentalretardation evidence, his claim must fail because he did notshow that the crime he committed was attributable to hislow IQ. Id., at 596-597. Judge Dennis dissented, concluding that the Texas court's application of Penry was unreasonable and that Tennard was entitled to habeas relief. 284F. 3d, at 597-604.542US2 Unit: $U68 [11-01-06 18:17:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN282 TENNARD v. DRETKEOpinion of the CourtTennard filed a petition for certiorari, and this Courtgranted the writ, vacated the judgment, and remanded forfurther consideration in light of Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U. S.304 (2002). Tennard v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 802 (2002). TheFifth Circuit took the remand to be for consideration of asubstantive Atkins claim. It observed that "Tennard hasnever argued that the Eighth Amendment prohibits his execution" and reinstated its prior panel opinion. Tennard v.Cockrell, 317 F. 3d 476, 477 (2003). We again granted certiorari. 540 U. S. 945 (2003).IIAA COA should issue if the applicant has "made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right," 28U. S. C. $ 2253(c)(2), which we have interpreted to requirethat the "petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court's assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong." Slack v. McDaniel,529 U. S., at 484; see also Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322,336 (2003) ("Under the controlling standard, a petitionermust `sho[w] that reasonable jurists could debate whether(or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have beenresolved in a different manner or that the issues presentedwere "adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further" ' "). The petitioner's arguments ultimately must beassessed under the deferential standard required by 28U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1): Relief may not be granted unless thestate court adjudication "resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearlyestablished Federal law, as determined by the SupremeCourt of the United States."The State has never disputed that Tennard's Penry claimwas properly preserved for federal habeas review. Not onlydid the state court consider the question on the merits, wenote that the issue was also raised by defense counsel prior542US2 Unit: $U68 [11-01-06 18:17:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN283Cite as: 542 U. S. 274 (2004)Opinion of the Courtto trial in a motion to set aside the indictment on the ground,among others, that the "Texas capital murder statutes do notexplicitly allow the consideration of any specific mitigatingcircumstances at the punishment phase of the prosecutionand, consequently, are violative of the accused's right to befree from cruel and unusual punishment and are also voidfor vagueness." Defendant's Motion to Set Aside the In-dictment in Cause No. 431127 (248th Jud. Dist. Ct. HarrisCounty, Tex., May 28, 1986), p. 4.BDespite paying lipservice to the principles guiding issu-ance of a COA, Tennard v. Cockrell, 284 F. 3d, at 594, theFifth Circuit's analysis proceeded along a distinctly differenttrack. Rather than examining the District Court's analysisof the Texas court decision, it invoked its own restrictivegloss on Penry I:"In reviewing a Penry claim, we must determinewhether the mitigating evidence introduced at trial wasconstitutionally relevant and beyond the effective reachof the jury. . . . To be constitutionally relevant, `the evidence must show (1) a uniquely severe permanent handi-cap with which the defendant was burdened through nofault of his own, . . . and (2) that the criminal act wasattributable to this severe permanent condition.' " Id.,at 595 (quoting Davis v. Scott, 51 F. 3d 457, 460-461(CA5 1995)).This test for "constitutional relevance," characterized bythe State at oral argument as a threshold "screening test,"Tr. of Oral Arg. 10, 28, appears to be applied uniformly inthe Fifth Circuit to Penry claims. See, e. g., Bigby v. Cockrell, 340 F. 3d 259, 273 (2003); Robertson v. Cockrell, 325 F. 3d243, 251 (2003) (en banc); Smith v. Cockrell, 311 F. 3d 661,680 (2002); Blue v. Cockrell, 298 F. 3d 318, 320-321 (2002);Davis, supra, at 460-461. Only after the court finds that542US2 Unit: $U68 [11-01-06 18:17:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN284 TENNARD v. DRETKEOpinion of the Courtcertain mitigating evidence is "constitutionally relevant" willit consider whether that evidence was within " `the "effectivereach" of the jur[y].' " E. g., Smith, supra, at 680 (court askswhether evidence was constitutionally relevant and, " `if so,' "will consider whether it was within jury's effective reach).InTennard v. Cockrell, the Fifth Circuit concluded that Tennard was "precluded from establishing a Penry claim" because his low IQ evidence bore no nexus to the crime, andso did not move on to the "effective reach" question. 284F. 3d, at 597.The Fifth Circuit's test has no foundation in the decisionsof this Court. Neither Penry I nor its progeny screenedmitigating evidence for "constitutional relevance" before considering whether the jury instructions comported with theEighth Amendment. Indeed, the mitigating evidence presented in Penry I was concededly relevant, see Tr. of OralArg., O. T. 1988, No. 87-6177, pp. 34-36, so even if limitingprinciples regarding relevance were suggested in our opinion--and we do not think they were--they could not havebeen material to the holding.When we addressed directly the relevance standard applicable to mitigating evidence in capital cases in McKoy v.North Carolina, 494 U. S. 433, 440-441 (1990), we spoke inthe most expansive terms. We established that the "meaning of relevance is no different in the context of mitigatingevidence introduced in a capital sentencing proceeding" thanin any other context, and thus the general evidentiary standard--" ` "any tendency to make the existence of any fact thatis of consequence to the determination of the action moreprobable or less probable than it would be without theevidence" ' "--applies. Id., at 440 (quoting New Jersey v.T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325, 345 (1985)). We quoted approvinglyfrom a dissenting opinion in the state court: " `Relevant mitigating evidence is evidence which tends logically to prove ordisprove some fact or circumstance which a fact-finder couldreasonably deem to have mitigating value.' " 494 U. S., at542US2 Unit: $U68 [11-01-06 18:17:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN285Cite as: 542 U. S. 274 (2004)Opinion of the Court440 (quoting State v. McKoy, 323 N. C. 1, 55-56, 372 S. E. 2d12, 45 (1988) (opinion of Exum, C. J.)). Thus, a State cannotbar "the consideration of . . . evidence if the sentencer couldreasonably find that it warrants a sentence less than death."494 U. S., at 441.Once this low threshold for relevance is met, the "EighthAmendment requires that the jury be able to consider andgive effect to" a capital defendant's mitigating evidence.Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, 377-378 (1990) (citingLockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978); Eddings v. Oklahoma,455 U. S. 104 (1982);Penry I, 492 U. S. 302 (1989)); see alsoPayne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 822 (1991) ("We have heldthat a State cannot preclude the sentencer from considering`any relevant mitigating evidence' that the defendant proffers in support of a sentence less than death. . . . [V]irtuallyno limits are placed on the relevant mitigating evidence acapital defendant may introduce concerning his own circumstances" (quoting Eddings, supra, at 114)).The Fifth Circuit's test is inconsistent with these principles. Most obviously, the test will screen out any positiveaspect of a defendant's character, because good charactertraits are neither "handicap[s]" nor typically traits to whichcriminal activity is "attributable." In Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 5 (1986), however, we made clear thatgood character evidence can be evidence that, "[u]nderEddings, . . . may not be excluded from the sentencer's consideration." We observed that even though the petitioner'sevidence of good conduct in jail did "not relate specifically topetitioner's culpability for the crime he committed, there isno question but that such [evidence] would be `mitigating' inthe sense that [it] might serve `as a basis for a sentence lessthan death.' Lockett, supra, at 604." Id., at 4-5 (citationomitted). Such evidence, we said, of "a defendant's disposition to make a well-behaved and peaceful adjustment to lifein prison is . . . by its nature relevant to the sentencing determination." Id., at 7. Of course, the Texas courts might542US2 Unit: $U68 [11-01-06 18:17:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN286 TENNARD v. DRETKEOpinion of the Courtreasonably conclude that evidence of good conduct in jail waswithin the jury's effective reach via the future dangerousness special issue. See Franklin v. Lynaugh, 487 U. S. 164,177-178 (1988) (plurality opinion); id., at 185-186 (O'Connor,J., concurring in judgment). But under the Fifth Circuit'stest, the evidence would have been screened out before thetime came to consider that question.In Tennard's case, the Fifth Circuit invoked both the"uniquely severe" and the "nexus" elements of its test todeny him relief under Penry I. Tennard v. Cockrell, 284F. 3d, at 596 (contrasting Tennard's low IQ evidence, whichdid "not constitute a uniquely severe condition," with mentalretardation, a "severe permanent condition"); id., at 596-597(concluding that Penry claims "must fail because [Tennard]made no showing at trial that the criminal act was attributable" to his condition).* Neither ground provided an adequate reason to fail to reach the heart of Tennard's Penryclaims.We have never denied that gravity has a place in the relevance analysis, insofar as evidence of a trivial feature of thedefendant's character or the circumstances of the crime isunlikely to have any tendency to mitigate the defendant'sculpability. See Skipper, supra, at 7, n. 2 ("We do not holdthat all facets of the defendant's ability to adjust to prisonlife must be treated as relevant and potentially mitigating.For example, we have no quarrel with the statement . . . that`how often [the defendant] will take a shower' is irrelevantto the sentencing determination" (quoting State v. Plath, 281*The Fifth Circuit stated that "a majority of the Court of CriminalAppeals found `no evidence in this record that [Tennard] is mentally retarded.' " 284 F. 3d, at 596-597. As described above, however, that wasthe conclusion of a four-judge plurality; the narrowest and thus controllingopinion on this point, correctly described by the Fifth Circuit as "conclud[ing] that there was not enough evidence of mental retardation in therecord to support Tennard's claim," id., at 596, n. 5 (emphasis added), isJudge Meyers' concurring opinion.542US2 Unit: $U68 [11-01-06 18:17:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN287Cite as: 542 U. S. 274 (2004)Opinion of the CourtS. C. 1, 15, 313 S. E. 2d 619, 627 (1984))). However, to saythat only those features and circumstances that a panel offederal appellate judges deems to be "severe" (let alone"uniquely severe") could have such a tendency is incorrect.Rather, the question is simply whether the evidence is ofsuch a character that it "might serve `as a basis for a sentence less than death,' " Skipper, supra, at 5.The Fifth Circuit was likewise wrong to have refusedto consider the debatability of the Penry question on theground that Tennard had not adduced evidence that hiscrime was attributable to his low IQ. In Atkins v. Virginia,536 U. S., at 316, we explained that impaired intellectualfunctioning is inherently mitigating: "[T]oday our societyviews mentally retarded offenders as categorically less culpable than the average criminal." Nothing in our opinionsuggested that a mentally retarded individual must establisha nexus between her mental capacity and her crime beforethe Eighth Amendment prohibition on executing her is triggered. Equally, we cannot countenance the suggestion thatlow IQ evidence is not relevant mitigating evidence--andthus that the Penry question need not even be asked--unlessthe defendant also establishes a nexus to the crime.The State claims that "the Fifth Circuit's Penry I jurisprudence is not at issue" in this case. Brief for Respondent35, n. 21; Tr. of Oral Arg. 33. To the contrary, that jurisprudence is directly at issue because the Fifth Circuit deniedTennard relief on the ground that he did not satisfy the requirements imposed by its "constitutional relevance" test.As we have explained, the Fifth Circuit's screening test hasno basis in our precedents and, indeed, is inconsistent withthe standard we have adopted for relevance in the capitalsentencing context. We therefore hold that the Fifth Circuit assessed Tennard's Penry claim under an improper legalstandard. Cf. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S., at 341 (holding, on certiorari review of the denial of a COA, that the542US2 Unit: $U68 [11-01-06 18:17:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN288 TENNARD v. DRETKEOpinion of the CourtFifth Circuit had applied an incorrect standard by improp-erly merging the requirements of two statutory sections).CWe turn to the analysis the Fifth Circuit should have con-ducted: Has Tennard "demonstrate[d] that reasonable juristswould find the district court's assessment of the constitu-tional claims debatable or wrong"? Slack v. McDaniel, 529U. S., at 484. We conclude that he has.Reasonable jurists could conclude that the low IQ evidenceTennard presented was relevant mitigating evidence. Evi-dence of significantly impaired intellectual functioning is obviously evidence that "might serve `as a basis for a sentenceless than death,' "Skipper, 476 U. S., at 5; see also, e. g., Wig-gins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 535 (2003) (observing, with respect to individual with IQ of 79, that "Wiggins['] . . . dimin-ished mental capacitie[s] further augment his mitigationcase"); Burger v. Kemp, 483 U. S. 776, 779, 789, n. 7 (1987)(noting that petitioner "had an IQ of 82 and functioned atthe level of a 12-year-old child," and later that "[i]n light ofpetitioner's youth at the time of the offense, . . . testimonythat his `mental and emotional development were at a levelseveral years below his chronological age' could not havebeen excluded by the state court" (quoting Eddings, 455U. S., at 116)).Reasonable jurists also could conclude that the TexasCourt of Criminal Appeals' application ofPenry to the factsof Tennard's case was unreasonable. The relationship between the special issues and Tennard's low IQ evidence hasthe same essential features as the relationship between thespecial issues and Penry's mental retardation evidence. Im-paired intellectual functioning has mitigating dimension beyond the impact it has on the individual's ability to act delib-erately. See Penry I, 492 U. S., at 322. A reasonable juristcould conclude that the jury might well have given Tennard'slow IQ evidence aggravating effect in considering his future542US2 Unit: $U68 [11-01-06 18:17:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN289Cite as: 542 U. S. 274 (2004)Rehnquist, C. J., dissentingdangerousness, not only as a matter of probable inferencefrom the evidence but also because the prosecutor told themto do so: "[W]hether he has a low IQ or not is not really theissue. Because the legislature, in asking you to address thatquestion, the reasons why he became a danger are not reallyrelevant. The fact that he is a danger, that the evidenceshows he's a danger, is the criteria to use in answering thatquestion." App. 60. Indeed, the prosecutor's commentspressed exactly the most problematic interpretation of thespecial issues, suggesting that Tennard's low IQ was irrelevant in mitigation, but relevant to the question whether heposed a future danger.* * *We hold that the Fifth Circuit's "uniquely severe permanent handicap" and "nexus" tests are incorrect, and wereject them. We hold that reasonable jurists would finddebatable or wrong the District Court's disposition ofTennard's low-IQ-based Penry claim, and that Tennard istherefore entitled to a COA. The judgment of the UnitedStates Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistentwith this opinion.
