C. $ 1983. 491 U. S., at 71.Petitioner takes this language to mean that $ 1983 does notauthorize suits against state officers for damages arisingfrom official acts. We reject this reading of Will and holdthat state officials sued in their individual capacities are"persons" for purposes of $ 1983.IIn 1988, petitioner Barbara Hafer sought election to thepost of auditor general of Pennsylvania. Respondents allege that during the campaign United States Attorney JamesWest gave Hafer a list of 21 employees in the auditor general's office who secured their jobs through payments to a for-mer employee of the office. App. 10. They further allegethat Hafer publicly promised to fire all employees on the listif elected.Ibid.Hafer won the election. Shortly after becoming auditorgeneral, she dismissed 18 employees, including named re-spondent James Melo, Jr., on the basis that they "bought"their jobs. Melo and seven other terminated employeessued Hafer and West in Federal District Court. They asserted state and federal claims, including a claim under$ 1983, and sought monetary damages. Carl Gurley and theremaining respondents in this case also lost their jobs withthe auditor general soon after Hafer took office. These respondents allege that Hafer discharged them because of theirDemocratic political affiliation and support for her opponentin the 1988 election. Id., at 28, 35, 40. They too filed suitagainst Hafer, seeking monetary damages and reinstatementunder $ 1983.After consolidating the Melo and Gurley actions, the District Court dismissed all claims. In relevant part, the courtheld that the $ 1983 claims against Hafer were barred because, under Will, she could not be held liable for employ-ment decisions made in her official capacity as auditorgeneral.502us1$$4Z 08-21-96 15:22:03 PAGES OPINPGT24 HAFER v. MELOOpinion of the CourtThe Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed thisportion of the District Court's decision. 912 F. 2d 628 (1990).As to claims for reinstatement brought against Hafer in herofficial capacity, the court rested on our statement in Willthat state officials sued for injunctive relief in their officialcapacities are "persons" subject to liability under $ 1983.See Will, supra, at 71, n. 10. Turning to respondents' monetary claims, the court found that six members of the Gurleygroup had expressly sought damages from Hafer in her personal capacity. The remaining plaintiffs "although not asexplicit, signified a similar intent." 912 F. 2d, at 636.* Thecourt found this critical. While Hafer's power to hire andfire derived from her position as auditor general, it said, asuit for damages based on the exercise of this authority couldbe brought against Hafer in her personal capacity. BecauseHafer acted under color of state law, respondents could maintain a $ 1983 individual-capacity suit against her.We granted certiorari, 498 U. S. 1118 (1991), to address thequestion whether state officers may be held personally liablefor damages under $ 1983 based upon actions taken in theirofficial capacities.*The Third Circuit looked to the proceedings below to determinewhether certain respondents brought their claims for damages againstHafer in her official capacity or her personal capacity. 912 F. 2d, at 635-636. Several other Courts of Appeals adhere to this practice. See Conner v. Reinhard, 847 F. 2d 384, 394, n. 8 (CA7), cert. denied, 488 U. S. 856(1988); Houston v. Reich, 932 F. 2d 883, 885 (CA10 1991); Lundgren v.McDaniel, 814 F. 2d 600, 603-604 (CA11 1987). Still others impose amore rigid pleading requirement. See Wells v. Brown, 891 F. 2d 591, 592(CA6 1989) ($ 1983 plaintiff must specifically plead that suit for damagesis brought against state official in individual capacity); Nix v. Norman,879 F. 2d 429, 431 (CA8 1989) (same). Because this issue is not properlybefore us, we simply reiterate the Third Circuit's view that "[i]t is obviously preferable for the plaintiff to be specific in the first instance to avoidany ambiguity." 912 F. 2d, at 636, n. 7. See this Court's Rule 14.1(a)("Only the questions set forth in the petition, or fairly included therein,will be considered by the Court").502us1$$4Z 08-21-96 15:22:03 PAGES OPINPGT25Cite as: 502 U. S. 21 (1991)Opinion of the CourtIIIn Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U. S. 159 (1985), the Courtsought to eliminate lingering confusion about the distinctionbetween personal- and official-capacity suits. We empha-sized that official-capacity suits " `generally represent onlyanother way of pleading an action against an entity of whichan officer is an agent.' "Id., at 165 (quoting Monell v. NewYork City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U. S. 658, 690, n. 55(1978)). Suits against state officials in their official capacitytherefore should be treated as suits against the State. 473U. S., at 166. Indeed, when officials sued in this capacity infederal court die or leave office, their successors automatically assume their roles in the litigation. See Fed. Rule Civ.Proc. 25(d)(1); Fed. Rule App. Proc. 43(c)(1); this Court's Rule35.3. Because the real party in interest in an official-capacity suit is the governmental entity and not the namedofficial, "the entity's `policy or custom' must have played apart in the violation of federal law." Graham, supra, at 166(quoting Monell, supra, at 694). For the same reason, theonly immunities available to the defendant in an officialcapacity action are those that the governmental entity pos-sesses. 473 U. S., at 167.Personal-capacity suits, on the other hand, seek to imposeindividual liability upon a government officer for actionstaken under color of state law. Thus, "[o]n the merits, toestablishpersonal liability in a $ 1983 action, it is enough toshow that the official, acting under color of state law, causedthe deprivation of a federal right." Id., at 166. While theplaintiff in a personal-capacity suit need not establish a connection to governmental "policy or custom," officials sued intheir personal capacities, unlike those sued in their officialcapacities, may assert personal immunity defenses such asobjectively reasonable reliance on existing law.Id., at166-167.Our decision in Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491U. S. 58 (1989), turned in part on these differences between502us1$$4Z 08-21-96 15:22:03 PAGES OPINPGT26 HAFER v. MELOOpinion of the Courtpersonal- and official-capacity actions. The principal issueinWill was whether States are "persons" subject to suitunder $ 1983. Section 1983 provides, in relevant part:"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State . . .subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of theUnited States or other person within the jurisdictionthereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, orimmunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shallbe liable to the party injured . . . ."The Court held that interpreting the words "[e]very person"to exclude the States accorded with the most natural readingof the law, with its legislative history, and with the rule thatCongress must clearly state its intention to alter " `the federal balance' " when it seeks to do so. Will, supra, at 65(quoting United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 349 (1971)).The Court then addressed the related question whetherstate officials, sued for monetary relief in their official capac-ities, are persons under $ 1983. We held that they are not.Although "state officials literally are persons," an official-capacity suit against a state officer "is not a suit against theofficial but rather is a suit against the official's office. Assuch it is no different from a suit against the State itself."491 U. S., at 71 (citation omitted).Summarizing our holding, we said: "[N]either a State norits officials acting in their official capacities are `persons'under $ 1983." Ibid. Hafer relies on this recapitulation forthe proposition that she may not be held personally liableunder $ 1983 for discharging respondents because she"act[ed]" in her official capacity as auditor general of Pennsylvania. Of course, the claims considered in Will wereofficial-capacity claims; the phrase "acting in their official capacities" is best understood as a reference to the capacity inwhich the state officer is sued, not the capacity in which theofficer inflicts the alleged injury. To the extent that Will502us1$$4Z 08-21-96 15:22:03 PAGES OPINPGT27Cite as: 502 U. S. 21 (1991)Opinion of the Courtallows the construction Hafer suggests, however, we noweliminate that ambiguity.AWill itself makes clear that the distinction between official-capacity suits and personal-capacity suits is more than "amere pleading device." Ibid. State officers sued for dam-ages in their official capacity are not "persons" for purposesof the suit because they assume the identity of the govern-ment that employs them.Ibid. By contrast, officers suedin their personal capacity come to court as individuals. Agovernment official in the role of personal-capacity defendantthus fits comfortably within the statutory term "person."Cf. id., at 71, n. 10 ("[A] state official in his or her officialcapacity, when sued for injunctive relief, would be a personunder $ 1983 because `official-capacity actions for prospectiverelief are not treated as actions against the State' ") (quotingGraham, 473 U. S., at 167, n. 14).Hafer seeks to overcome the distinction between officialand personal-capacity suits by arguing that $ 1983 liabilityturns not on the capacity in which state officials are sued,but on the capacity in which they acted when injuring theplaintiff. Under Will, she asserts, state officials may not beheld liable in their personal capacity for actions they take intheir official capacity. Although one Court of Appeals hasendorsed this view, see Cowan v. University of LouisvilleSchool of Medicine, 900 F. 2d 936, 942-943 (CA6 1990), wefind it both unpersuasive as an interpretation of $ 1983 andforeclosed by our prior decisions.Through $ 1983, Congress sought "to give a remedy to parties deprived of constitutional rights, privileges and immuni-ties by an official's abuse of his position."Monroe v. Pape,365 U. S. 167, 172 (1961). Accordingly, it authorized suits toredress deprivations of civil rights by persons acting "undercolor of any [state] statute, ordinance, regulation, custom,or usage." 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. The requirement of actionunder color of state law means that Hafer may be liable for502us1$$4Z 08-21-96 15:22:03 PAGES OPINPGT28 HAFER v. MELOOpinion of the Courtdischarging respondents precisely because of her authorityas auditor general. We cannot accept the novel propositionthat this same official authority insulates Hafer from suit.In an effort to limit the scope of her argument, Hafer distinguishes between two categories of acts taken under colorof state law: those outside the official's authority or not es-sential to the operation of state government, and those bothwithin the official's authority and necessary to the perform-ance of governmental functions. Only the former group, sheasserts, can subject state officials to personal liability under$ 1983; the latter group (including the employment decisionsat issue in this case) should be considered acts of the Statethat cannot give rise to a personal-capacity action.The distinction Hafer urges finds no support in the broadlanguage of $ 1983. To the contrary, it ignores our holdingthat Congress enacted $ 1983 " `to enforce provisions of theFourteenth Amendment against those who carry a badge ofauthority of a State and represent it in some capacity,whether they act in accordance with their authority or misuse it.' " Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 243 (1974) (quoting Monroe v. Pape, supra, at 171-172). Because of thatintent, we have held that in $ 1983 actions the statutory requirement of action "under color of " state law is just asbroad as the Fourteenth Amendment's "state action" requirement. Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922,929 (1982).Furthermore, Hafer's distinction cannot be reconciled withour decisions regarding immunity of government officers otherwise personally liable for acts done in the course of theirofficial duties. Her theory would absolutely immunize stateofficials from personal liability for acts within their authorityand necessary to fulfilling governmental responsibilities.Yet our cases do not extend absolute immunity to all officerswho engage in necessary official acts. Rather, immunityfrom suit under $ 1983 is "predicated upon a considered inquiry into the immunity historically accorded the relevant502us1$$4Z 08-21-96 15:22:03 PAGES OPINPGT29Cite as: 502 U. S. 21 (1991)Opinion of the Courtofficial at common law and the interests behind it," Imblerv. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 421 (1976), and officials seekingabsolute immunity must show that such immunity is justifiedfor the governmental function at issue, Burns v. Reed, 500U. S. 478, 486-487 (1991).This Court has refused to extend absolute immunity beyond a very limited class of officials, including the Presidentof the United States, legislators carrying out their legislativefunctions, and judges carrying out their judicial functions,"whose special functions or constitutional status requirescomplete protection from suit." Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457U. S. 800, 807 (1982). State executive officials are not entitled to absolute immunity for their official actions. Scheuerv. Rhodes, supra. In several instances, moreover, we haveconcluded that no more than a qualified immunity attachesto administrative employment decisions, even if the same official has absolute immunity when performing other functions. See Forrester v. White, 484 U. S. 219 (1988) (dismissalof court employee by state judge); Harlow v. Fitzgerald,supra (discharge of Air Force employee, allegedly orchestrated by senior White House aides) (action under Bivens v.Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971));Davis v. Passman, 442 U. S. 228 (1979) (dismissal of congressional aide) (Bivens action). That Hafer may assert personal immunity within the framework of these cases in noway supports her argument here.BHafer further asks us to read Will's language concerningsuits against state officials as establishing the limits of liability under the Eleventh Amendment. She asserts that imposing personal liability on officeholders may infringe onstate sovereignty by rendering government less effective;thus, she argues, the Eleventh Amendment forbids personalcapacity suits against state officials in federal court.502us1$$4Z 08-21-96 15:22:03 PAGES OPINPGT30 HAFER v. MELOOpinion of the CourtMost certainly, Will's holding does not rest directly on theEleventh Amendment. Whereas the Eleventh Amendmentbars suits in federal court "by private parties seeking to impose a liability which must be paid from public funds in thestate treasury," Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 663 (1974),Will arose from a suit in state court. We considered theEleventh Amendment in Will only because the fact that Congress did not intend to override state immunity when it enacted $ 1983 was relevant to statutory construction: "Giventhat a principal purpose behind the enactment of $ 1983 wasto provide a federal forum for civil rights claims," Congress'failure to authorize suits against States in federal courts suggested that it also did not intend to authorize such claims instate courts. 491 U. S., at 66.To the extent that Hafer argues from the EleventhAmendment itself, she makes a claim that failed in Scheuerv. Rhodes, supra. In Scheuer, personal representatives ofthe estates of three students who died at Kent State University in May 1970 sought damages from the Governor of Ohioand other state officials. The District Court dismissed theircomplaints on the theory that the suits, although broughtagainst state officials in their personal capacities, were insubstance actions against the State of Ohio and thereforebarred by the Eleventh Amendment.We rejected this view. "[S]ince Ex parte Young, 209 U. S.123 (1908)," we said, "it has been settled that the EleventhAmendment provides no shield for a state official confrontedby a claim that he had deprived another of a federal rightunder the color of state law." Scheuer, supra, at 237.While the doctrine of Ex parte Young does not apply wherea plaintiff seeks damages from the public treasury, damagesawards against individual defendants in federal courts "area permissible remedy in some circumstances notwithstanding the fact that they hold public office." 416 U. S., at 238.That is, the Eleventh Amendment does not erect a barrier502us1$$4Z 08-21-96 15:22:03 PAGES OPINPGT31Cite as: 502 U. S. 21 (1991)Opinion of the Courtagainst suits to impose "individual and personal liability" onstate officials under $ 1983. Ibid.To be sure, imposing personal liability on state officersmay hamper their performance of public duties. But suchconcerns are properly addressed within the framework ofour personal immunity jurisprudence. SeeForrester v.White, supra, at 223. Insofar as respondents seek damagesagainst Hafer personally, the Eleventh Amendment does notrestrict their ability to sue in federal court.We hold that state officials, sued in their individual capac-ities, are "persons" within the meaning of $ 1983. The Eleventh Amendment does not bar such suits, nor are state offi-cers absolutely immune from personal liability under $ 1983solely by virtue of the "official" nature of their acts.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
