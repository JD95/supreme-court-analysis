The question in this case is whether the presence of alter-nate jurors during jury deliberations was a "plain error" thatthe Court of Appeals was authorized to correct under Fed-eral Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b).IEach of the respondents, Guy W. Olano, Jr., and RaymondM. Gray, served on the board of directors of a savings andloan association. In 1986, the two were indicted in theWestern District of Washington on multiple federal chargesfor their participation in an elaborate loan "kickback"scheme. Their joint jury trial with five other codefendantscommenced in March 1987. All of the parties agreed that14 jurors would be selected to hear the case, and that the 2alternates would be identified before deliberations began.On May 26, shortly before the end of the 3-month trial,the District Court suggested to the defendants that the twoalternate jurors, soon to be identified, might be allowed toattend deliberations along with the regular jurors:". . . I'd just like you to think about it, you have a day,let me know, it's just a suggestion and you can--if thereis even one person who doesn't like it we won't do it, butit is a suggestion that other courts have followed in longcases where jurors have sat through a lot of testimony,and that is to let the alternates go in but not participate,but just to sit in on deliberations."It's strictly a matter of courtesy and I know manyjudges have done it with no objections from counsel.One of the other things it does is if they don't participatebut they're there, if an emergency comes up and peopledecide they'd rather go with a new alternate rather than11, which the rules provide, it keeps that option open.It also keeps people from feeling they've sat here forthree months and then get just kind of kicked out. Butit's certainly not worth--unless it's something you all507us3$60J 11-18-96 23:04:21 PAGES OPINPGT728 UNITED STATES v. OLANOOpinion of the Courtagree to, it's not worth your spending time hasslingabout, you know what I mean? You've got too muchelse on your mind. I don't want it to be a big issue;it's just a suggestion. Think about it and let me know."App. 79.The matter arose again the next day, in an ambiguousexchange between Gray's counsel and the District Court:"THE COURT: [H]ave you given any more thoughtas to whether you want the alternates to go in and notparticipate, or do you want them out?"MR. ROBISON [counsel for Gray]: We would askthey not."THE COURT: Not." App. 82.One day later, on May 28, the last day of trial, the DistrictCourt for a third time asked the defendants whether theywanted the alternate jurors to retire into the jury room.Counsel for defendant Davy Hilling gave an unequivocal,affirmative answer."THE COURT: Well, Counsel, I received your alter-nates. Do I understand that the defendants now--it'shard to keep up with you, Counsel. It's sort of a dayby day--but that's all right. You do all agree that allfourteen deliberate?"Okay. Do you want me to instruct the two alternates not to participate in deliberation?"MR. KELLOGG [counsel for Hilling]: That's what Iwas on my feet to say. It's my understanding that theconversation was the two alternates go back there instructed that they are not to take part in any fashion inthe deliberations." App. 86.This discussion, like the preceding two, took place outsidethe hearing of the jurors. As before, both Gray's counseland Olano's counsel were present. Gray, too, attended allthree discussions. Olano may not have attended the third--507us3$60J 11-18-96 23:04:21 PAGES OPINPGT729Cite as: 507 U. S. 725 (1993)Opinion of the Courthe claims that the Marshal failed to return him to the court-room in time--but he was present at the first two.The District Court concluded that Hilling's counsel wasspeaking for the other defendants as well as his own client.None of the other counsel intervened during the colloquybetween the District Court and Hilling's counsel on May 28,nor did anyone object later the same day when the courtinstructed the jurors that the two alternates would be per-mitted to attend deliberations. The court instructed:"We have indicated to you that the parties would be selecting alternates at this time. I am going to informyou who those alternates are, but before I do, let me tellyou, I think it was a difficult selection for all concerned,and since the law requires that there be a jury of twelve,it is only going to be a jury of twelve. But what wewould like to do in this case is have all of you go backso that even the alternates can be there for the deliberations, but according to the law, the alternates must notparticipate in the deliberations. It's going to be hard,but if you are an alternate, we think you should be therebecause things do happen in the course of lengthy jurydeliberations, and if you need to step in, we want you tobe able to step in having heard the deliberations. Butwe are going to ask that you not participate."The alternates are Norman Sargent and ShirleyKinsella. I am going to ask at this time now, ladies andgentlemen, that you retire to the jury room and beginyour deliberations." App. 89-90.During deliberations, one of the alternate jurors was excusedat his request. The other alternate remained until the juryreturned with its verdict.Both respondents were convicted on a number of charges.They appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for theNinth Circuit. 934 F. 2d 1425 (1991). The Court of Appealsreversed certain counts for insufficient evidence and then507us3$60J 11-18-96 23:04:21 PAGES OPINPGT730 UNITED STATES v. OLANOOpinion of the Courtconsidered whether the presence of alternate jurors duringjury deliberations violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(c):"The court may direct that not more than 6 jurors inaddition to the regular jury be called and impanelled tosit as alternate jurors. Alternate jurors in the orderin which they are called shall replace jurors who, priorto the time the jury retires to consider its verdict, be-come or are found to be unable or disqualified to performtheir duties. . . . An alternate juror who does not replacea regular juror shall be discharged after the jury retiresto consider its verdict."Because respondents had not objected to the alternates'presence, the court applied a "plain error" standard underRule 52(b). Noting that "[w]e have not previously directlyresolved the question of the validity of a verdict when alternate jurors are permitted to be present during the jury'sdeliberations," the court relied on the "language of Rule24(c), Rule 23(b), the Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 23,and related Ninth Circuit precedent" to hold that Rule 24(c)barred alternate jurors from attending jury deliberationsunless the defendant, on the record, explicitly consented totheir attendance. 934 F. 2d, at 1436-1437. The court foundthat Rule 24(c) was violated in the instant case, because "thedistrict court did not obtain individual waivers from eachdefendant personally, either orally or in writing."Id., at1438. It then held that the presence of alternates in violation of Rule 24(c) was "inherently prejudicial" and reversibleper se. Ibid."We cannot fairly ascertain whether in a given casethe alternate jurors followed the district court's prohibition on participation. However, even if they heeded theletter of the court's instructions and remained orallymute throughout, it is entirely possible that their atti-tudes, conveyed by facial expressions, gestures or the507us3$60J 11-18-96 23:04:21 PAGES OPINPGT731Cite as: 507 U. S. 725 (1993)Opinion of the Courtlike, may have had some effect upon the decision of oneor more jurors." Ibid. (internal quotation marks andbrackets omitted).Finally, in a footnote, the court decided that "[b]ecause theviolation is inherently prejudicial and because it infringesupon a substantial right of the defendants, it falls within theplain error doctrine."Id., at 1439, n. 23.The Court of Appeals vacated respondents' remaining convictions and did not reach the other "substantial issues" thatthey had raised.Id., at 1428, n. 3. We granted certiorarito clarify the standard for "plain error" review by the courtsof appeals under Rule 52(b). 504 U. S. 908 (1992).II"No procedural principle is more familiar to this Courtthan that a constitutional right," or a right of any other sort,"may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by thefailure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunalhaving jurisdiction to determine it." Yakus v. UnitedStates, 321 U. S. 414, 444 (1944). Federal Rule of CriminalProcedure 52(b), which governs on appeal from criminal proceedings, provides a court of appeals a limited power to cor-rect errors that were forfeited because not timely raised indistrict court. The Rule has remained unchanged since theoriginal version of the Criminal Rules, and was intended as"a restatement of existing law." Advisory Committee'sNotes on Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52, 18 U. S. C. App., p. 833.It is paired, appropriately, with Rule 52(a), which governsnonforfeited errors. Rule 52 provides:"(a) Harmless Error. Any error, defect, irregu-larity or variance which does not affect substantialrights shall be disregarded."(b)Plain Error. Plain errors or defects affectingsubstantial rights may be noticed although they werenot brought to the attention of the court."507us3$60J 11-18-96 23:04:21 PAGES OPINPGT732 UNITED STATES v. OLANOOpinion of the CourtAlthough "[a] rigid and undeviating judicially declaredpractice under which courts of review would invariably andunder all circumstances decline to consider all questionswhich had not previously been specifically urged would beout of harmony with . . . the rules of fundamental justice,"Hormel v. Helvering, 312 U. S. 552, 557 (1941), the authoritycreated by Rule 52(b) is circumscribed. There must be an"error" that is "plain" and that "affect[s] substantial rights."Moreover, Rule 52(b) leaves the decision to correct theforfeited error within the sound discretion of the court ofappeals, and the court should not exercise that discretionunless the error " `seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity orpublic reputation of judicial proceedings.' "United States v.Young, 470 U. S. 1, 15 (1985) (quoting United States v. Atkinson, 297 U. S. 157, 160 (1936)).ARule 52(b) defines a single category of forfeited-but-reversible error. Although it is possible to read the Rule inthe disjunctive, as creating two separate categories--"plainerrors" and "defects affecting substantial rights"--that reading is surely wrong. See Young, 470 U. S., at 15, n. 12 (de-clining to adopt disjunctive reading). As we explained inYoung, the phrase "error or defect" is more simply read as"error." Ibid. The forfeited error "may be noticed" only ifit is "plain" and "affect[s] substantial rights." More pre-cisely, a court of appeals may correct the error (either vacating for a new trial, or reversing outright) only if it meetsthese criteria. The appellate court must consider the error,putative or real, in deciding whether the judgment belowshould be overturned, but cannot provide that remedy unlessRule 52(b) applies (or unless some other provision authorizesthe error's correction, an issue that respondents do notraise).The first limitation on appellate authority under Rule 52(b)is that there indeed be an "error." Deviation from a legal507us3$60J 11-18-96 23:04:21 PAGES OPINPGT733Cite as: 507 U. S. 725 (1993)Opinion of the Courtrule is "error" unless the rule has been waived. For exam-ple, a defendant who knowingly and voluntarily pleads guiltyin conformity with the requirements of Rule 11 cannot havehis conviction vacated by a court of appeals on the groundthat he ought to have had a trial. Because the right to trialis waivable, and because the defendant who enters a validguilty plea waives that right, his conviction without a trialis not "error."Waiver is different from forfeiture. Whereas forfeiture isthe failure to make the timely assertion of a right, waiver isthe "intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a knownright." Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 464 (1938); see, e. g.,Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 894, n. 2 (1991)(Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)(distinguishing between "waiver" and "forfeiture"); Spritzer,Criminal Waiver, Procedural Default and the Burger Court,126 U. Pa. L. Rev. 473, 474-477 (1978) (same); Westen, Awayfrom Waiver: A Rationale for the Forfeiture of ConstitutionalRights in Criminal Procedure, 75 Mich. L. Rev. 1214, 1214-1215 (1977) (same). Whether a particular right is waivable;whether the defendant must participate personally in thewaiver; whether certain procedures are required for waiver;and whether the defendant's choice must be particularly informed or voluntary, all depend on the right at stake. See,e. g., 2 W. LaFave & J. Israel, Criminal Procedure $ 11.6(1984) (allocation of authority between defendant and counsel); Dix, Waiver in Criminal Procedure: A Brief for MoreCareful Analysis, 55 Texas L. Rev. 193 (1977) (waivabilityand standards for waiver). Mere forfeiture, as opposed towaiver, does not extinguish an "error" under Rule 52(b). Although in theory it could be argued that "[i]f the questionwas not presented to the trial court no error was committedby the trial court, hence there is nothing to review," Orfield,The Scope of Appeal in Criminal Cases, 84 U. Pa. L. Rev.825, 840 (1936), this is not the theory that Rule 52(b) adopts.If a legal rule was violated during the district court proceed507us3$60J 11-18-96 23:04:21 PAGES OPINPGT734 UNITED STATES v. OLANOOpinion of the Courtings, and if the defendant did not waive the rule, then therehas been an "error" within the meaning of Rule 52(b) despitethe absence of a timely objection.The second limitation on appellate authority under Rule52(b) is that the error be "plain." "Plain" is synonymouswith "clear" or, equivalently, "obvious." See Young, supra,at 17, n. 14;United States v. Frady, 456 U. S. 152, 163 (1982).We need not consider the special case where the error wasunclear at the time of trial but becomes clear on appeal because the applicable law has been clarified. At a minimum,a court of appeals cannot correct an error pursuant to Rule52(b) unless the error is clear under current law.The third and final limitation on appellate authority underRule 52(b) is that the plain error "affec[t] substantial rights."This is the same language employed in Rule 52(a), and inmost cases it means that the error must have been prejudicial: It must have affected the outcome of the district courtproceedings. See, e. g., Bank of Nova Scotia v. UnitedStates, 487 U. S. 250, 255-257 (1988); United States v. Lane,474 U. S. 438, 454-464 (1986) (Brennan, J., concurring in partand dissenting in part); Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S.750, 758-765 (1946). When the defendant has made a timelyobjection to an error and Rule 52(a) applies, a court of appeals normally engages in a specific analysis of the districtcourt record--a so-called "harmless error" inquiry--to determine whether the error was prejudicial. Rule 52(b) normally requires the same kind of inquiry, with one importantdifference: It is the defendant rather than the Governmentwho bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice. In most cases, a court of appeals cannot correct theforfeited error unless the defendant shows that the errorwas prejudicial. See Young, supra, at 17, n. 14 ("[F]ederalcourts have consistently interpreted the plain-error doctrineas requiring an appellate court to find that the claimed error. . . had [a] prejudicial impact on the jury's deliberations").This burden shifting is dictated by a subtle but important507us3$60J 11-18-96 23:04:21 PAGES OPINPGT735Cite as: 507 U. S. 725 (1993)Opinion of the Courtdifference in language between the two parts of Rule 52:While Rule 52(a) precludes error correction only if the error"does not affect substantial rights" (emphasis added), Rule52(b) authorizes no remedy unless the error does "affec[t]substantial rights." See also Note, Appellate Review in aCriminal Case of Errors Made Below Not Properly Raisedand Reserved, 23 Miss. L. J. 42, 57 (1951) (summarizing exist-ing law) ("The error must be real and such that it probablyinfluenced the verdict . . .").We need not decide whether the phrase "affecting substantial rights" is always synonymous with "prejudicial." SeegenerallyArizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 310 (1991)(constitutional error may not be found harmless if error deprives defendant of the " `basic protections [without which] acriminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehiclefor determination of guilt or innocence, and no criminal pun-ishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair' ") (quotingRose v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570, 577-578 (1986)). There may bea special category of forfeited errors that can be correctedregardless of their effect on the outcome, but this issue neednot be addressed. Nor need we address those errors thatshould be presumed prejudicial if the defendant cannot makea specific showing of prejudice. Normally, although perhapsnot in every case, the defendant must make a specific show-ing of prejudice to satisfy the "affecting substantial rights"prong of Rule 52(b). BRule 52(b) is permissive, not mandatory. If the forfeitederror is "plain" and "affect[s] substantial rights," the courtof appeals has authority to order correction, but is notrequired to do so. The language of the Rule ("may be noticed"), the nature of forfeiture, and the established appellatepractice that Congress intended to continue all point to thisconclusion. "[I]n criminal cases, where the life, or as in thiscase the liberty, of the defendant is at stake, the courts ofthe United States, in the exercise of a sound discretion, may507us3$60J 11-18-96 23:04:21 PAGES OPINPGT736 UNITED STATES v. OLANOOpinion of the Courtnotice [forfeited error]." Sykes v. United States, 204 F. 909,913-914 (CA8 1913). Accord,Crawford v. United States, 212U. S. 183, 194 (1909); former Supreme Court Rule 27.6 (1939)(cited in Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Crim.Proc. Rule 52(b), 18 U. S. C. App., p. 833) (" `[T]he court, at itsoption, may notice a plain error not assigned or specified' ").We previously have explained that the discretion conferred by Rule 52(b) should be employed " `in those circum-stances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwiseresult.' " Young, 470 U. S., at 15 (quoting Frady, supra, at163, n. 14). In our collateral-review jurisprudence, the term"miscarriage of justice" means that the defendant is actuallyinnocent. See, e. g., Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333, 339-340 (1992). The court of appeals should no doubt correct aplain forfeited error that causes the conviction or sentencingof an actually innocent defendant, see, e. g., Wiborg v. UnitedStates, 163 U. S. 632 (1896), but we have never held that aRule 52(b) remedy is only warranted in cases of actualinnocence.Rather, the standard that should guide the exercise of remedial discretion under Rule 52(b) was articulated in UnitedStates v. Atkinson, 297 U. S. 157 (1936). The court of appeals should correct a plain forfeited error affecting substantial rights if the error "seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings." Id., at160. As we explained in Young, the "standard laid down inUnited States v. Atkinson [was] codified in Federal Rule ofCriminal Procedure 52(b)," 470 U. S., at 7, and we repeatedlyhave quoted the Atkinson language in describing plain-errorreview, see id., at 15; Frady, supra, at 163, n. 13; Silberv. United States, 370 U. S. 717, 718 (1962) (per curiam); Johnson v. United States, 318 U. S. 189, 200 (1943); United Statesv. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U. S. 150, 239 (1940); see alsoConnor v. Finch, 431 U. S. 407, 421, n. 19 (1977) (civil appeal).An error may "seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings" independent of the507us3$60J 11-18-96 23:04:21 PAGES OPINPGT737Cite as: 507 U. S. 725 (1993)Opinion of the Courtdefendant's innocence. Conversely, a plain error affectingsubstantial rights does not, without more, satisfy the Atkinson standard, for otherwise the discretion afforded by Rule52(b) would be illusory.With these basic principles in mind, we turn to the in-stant case.IIIThe presence of alternate jurors during jury deliberationsis no doubt a deviation from Rule 24(c). The Rule explicitlystates: "An alternate juror who does not replace a regularjuror shall be discharged after the jury retires to consider itsverdict." It is a separate question whether such deviationamounts to "error" when the defendant consents to the alternates' presence. The Government supposes that there wasindeed an "error" in this case, on the premise that Rule 24(c)is nonwaivable, see Reply Brief for United States 9, n. 4,and we assume without deciding that this premise is correct.The Government also essentially concedes that the "error"was "plain." Seeid., at 8-9, and n. 4.We therefore focus our attention on whether the error "affect[ed] substantial rights" within the meaning of Rule 52(b),and conclude that it did not. The presence of alternate jurors during jury deliberations is not the kind of error that"affect[s] substantial rights" independent of its prejudicialimpact. Nor have respondents made a specific showing ofprejudice. Finally, we see no reason to presume prejudicehere.Assumingarguendo that certain errors "affec[t] substan-tial rights" independent of prejudice, the instant violation ofRule 24(c) is not such an error. Although the presence ofalternate jurors does contravene " `the cardinal principlethat the deliberations of the jury shall remain private andsecret,' " Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. Rule Crim.Proc. 23(b), 18 U. S. C. App., p. 785 (quoting United States v.Virginia Erection Corp., 335 F. 2d 868, 872 (CA4 1964)), theprimary if not exclusive purpose of jury privacy and secrecy507us3$60J 11-18-96 23:04:21 PAGES OPINPGT738 UNITED STATES v. OLANOOpinion of the Courtis to protect the jury's deliberations from improper influence."[I]f no harm resulted from this intrusion [of an alternatejuror into the jury room,] reversal would be pointless."United States v. Watson, 669 F. 2d 1374, 1391 (CA11 1982).We generally have analyzed outside intrusions upon the juryfor prejudicial impact. See, e. g., Parker v. Gladden, 385U. S. 363 (1967) (per curiam) (bailiff 's comments to jurors,such as "Oh that wicked fellow he is guilty," were prejudicial); Patton v. Yount, 467 U. S. 1025 (1984) (pretrial publicitywas not prejudicial); Holbrook v. Flynn, 475 U. S. 560 (1986)(presence of uniformed state troopers in courtroom was notprejudicial). A prime example is Remmer v. United States,347 U. S. 227 (1954), where an outsider had communicatedwith a juror during a criminal trial, appearing to offer abribe, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation then hadinvestigated the incident. We noted that "[t]he sending ofan F. B. I. agent in the midst of a trial to investigate a juroras to his conduct is bound to impress the juror," and remanded for the District Court to "determine the circumstances, the impact thereof upon the juror, and whether ornot it was prejudicial, in a hearing with all interested partiespermitted to participate." Id., at 229-230.This "intrusion" jurisprudence was summarized in Smithv. Phillips, 455 U. S. 209 (1982):"[D]ue process does not require a new trial every timea juror has been placed in a potentially compromisingsituation. Were that the rule, few trials would be constitutionally acceptable. . . . [I]t is virtually impossible toshield jurors from every contact or influence that mighttheoretically affect their vote. Due process means ajury capable and willing to decide the case solely on theevidence before it, and a trial judge ever watchful toprevent prejudicial occurrences and to determine theeffect of such occurrences when they happen." Id., at217.507us3$60J 11-18-96 23:04:21 PAGES OPINPGT739Cite as: 507 U. S. 725 (1993)Opinion of the CourtThere may be cases where an intrusion should be presumedprejudicial, see,e. g., Patton, supra, at 1031-1035; Turner v.Louisiana, 379 U. S. 466 (1965), but a presumption of preju-dice as opposed to a specific analysis does not change theultimate inquiry: Did the intrusion affect the jury's deliberations and thereby its verdict? We cannot imagine why egre-gious comments by a bailiff to a juror(Parker) or an apparent bribe followed by an official investigation (Remmer)should be evaluated in terms of "prejudice," while the merepresence of alternate jurors during jury deliberations shouldnot. Of course, the issue here is whether the alternates'presence sufficed to establish remedial authority under Rule52(b), not whether it violated the Sixth Amendment or DueProcess Clause, but we see no reason to depart from thenormal interpretation of the phrase "affecting substantialrights."The question, then, is whether the instant violation of Rule24(c) prejudiced respondents, either specifically or presumptively. In theory, the presence of alternate jurors duringjury deliberations might prejudice a defendant in two different ways: either because the alternates actually participatedin the deliberations, verbally or through "body language"; orbecause the alternates' presence exerted a "chilling" effecton the regular jurors. See Watson, supra, at 1391; UnitedStates v. Allison, 481 F. 2d 468, 472 (CA5 1973). Conversely,"if the alternate in fact abided by the court's instructions toremain orally silent and not to otherwise indicate his viewsor attitude . . . and if the presence of the alternate did notoperate as a restraint upon the regular jurors' freedom ofexpression and action, we see little substantive differencebetween the presence of [the alternate] and the presence inthe juryroom of an unexamined book which had not beenadmitted into evidence." Id., at 472.Respondents have made no specific showing that the alternate jurors in this case either participated in the jury's deliberations or "chilled" deliberation by the regular jurors. We507us3$60J 11-18-96 23:04:21 PAGES OPINPGT740 UNITED STATES v. OLANOOpinion of the Courtneed not decide whether testimony on this score by the alter-nate jurors or the regular jurors, through affidavits or at aRemmer-like hearing, would violate Federal Rule of Evi-dence 606(b), compareWatson, supra, at 1391-1392, andn. 17, with United States v. Beasley, 464 F. 2d 468 (CA101972), or whether the courts of appeals have authority toremand forRemmer-like hearings on plain-error review. Respondents have never requested a hearing, and thus the rec-ord before us contains no direct evidence that the alternatejurors influenced the verdict. On this record, we are notpersuaded that the instant violation of Rule 24(c) was actually prejudicial.Nor will we presume prejudice for purposes of the Rule52(b) analysis here. The Court of Appeals was incorrect infinding the error "inherently prejudicial." 934 F. 2d, at1439. Until the close of trial, the 2 alternate jurors wereindistinguishable from the 12 regular jurors. Along withthe regular jurors, they commenced their office with an oath,see Tr. 212 (Mar. 2, 1987), received the normal initial admonishment, see id., at 212-218, heard the same evidence andarguments, and were not identified as alternates until afterthe District Court gave a final set of instructions, see App.89-90. In those instructions, the District Court specificallyenjoined the jurors that "according to the law, the alternatesmust not participate in the deliberations," and reiterated,"we are going to ask that you not participate." Ibid. TheCourt of Appeals should not have supposed that this injunction was contravened. "[It is] the almost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions." Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U. S. 200, 206 (1987). "[We] presum[e]that jurors, conscious of the gravity of their task, attendclosely the particular language of the trial court's instructions in a criminal case and strive to understand, make senseof, and follow the instructions given them." Francis v.Franklin, 471 U. S. 307, 324, n. 9 (1985). See also Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 694 (1984) (in assessing507us3$60J 11-18-96 23:04:21 PAGES OPINPGT741Cite as: 507 U. S. 725 (1993)Kennedy, J., concurringprejudice for purposes of ineffective-assistance claim, "acourt should presume . . . that the judge or jury acted according to law"). Nor do we think that the mere presence ofalternate jurors entailed a sufficient risk of "chill" to justifya presumption of prejudice on that score.In sum, respondents have not met their burden of showingprejudice under Rule 52(b). Whether the Governmentcould have met its burden of showing the absence of preju-dice, under Rule 52(a), if respondents had not forfeited theirclaim of error, is not at issue here. This is a plain-error case,and it is respondents who must persuade the appellate courtthat the deviation from Rule 24(c) was prejudicial.Because the conceded error in this case did not "affec[t]substantial rights," the Court of Appeals had no authorityto correct it. We need not consider whether the error,if prejudicial, would have warranted correction under theAtkinson standard as "seriously affect[ing] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings." Thejudgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and thecase is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.
