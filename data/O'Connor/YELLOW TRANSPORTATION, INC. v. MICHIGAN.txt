Ibid.Prior to 1994, the ICC allowed States to charge interstatemotor carriers annual registration fees of up to $10 per vehi-cle. See 49 CFR $ 1023.33 (1992). As proof of registration,participating States would issue a stamp for each of the car-rier's vehicles. $ 1023.32. The stamp was affixed on a "uniform identification cab car[d]" carried in each vehicle, withinthe square bearing the name of the issuing State.$$ 1023.32(d)-(e). This system came to be known as the"bingo card" system. Single State Insurance Registration,9 I. C.

Inthe Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of1991 (ISTEA), Congress therefore directed the ICC to implement a new system to replace the "bingo card" regime.**Congress abolished the ICC in 1995 and assigned responsibility foradministering the new Single State Registration System to the Secretaryof Transportation.

S. 36 (2002)Opinion of the CourtThe ICC issued its final implementing regulations in May1993 after notice-and-comment proceedings.Single-StateInsurance Registration, supra. The rulemaking gave riseto the central question in this case: whether, under the Single State Registration System, States were free to terminate"reciprocity agreements" that were in place under the "bingocard" regime. Id., at 617-619. Under these agreements, inexchange for reciprocal treatment, some States discountedor waived registration fees for carriers from other States.Id., at 617.In issuing a set of proposed rules and soliciting furthercomments, the ICC questioned whether it had the power torequire States to preserve pre-existing reciprocity agreements. Single State Insurance Registration, No. MC-100(Sub-No. 6), 1993 WL 17833, *12 (Jan. 22, 1993); see SingleState Insurance Registration--1993 Rules, 9 I. C. C. 2d 1, 11(1992). It noted that these agreements were voluntary andmutually beneficial and commented that "as long as no carrier is charged more than [a State's] standard November 15,1991, fee for all carriers (subject to the $10 limit), the requirements of [ISTEA] are satisfied." 1993 WL 17833, *12.In its final implementing regulations, however, the ICCconcluded, in light of further comments, that its preliminary view on reciprocity agreements was inconsistent withISTEA's fee-cap provision and with "the intent of the lawthat the flow of revenue for the States be maintained whilethe burden of the registration system for carriers be reduced." Single State Insurance Registration, 9 I. C. C. 2d,at 618. The agency therefore determined that States participating in the Single State Registration System "must consider fees charged or collected under reciprocity agreementswhen determining the fees charged or collected as of November 15, 1991, as required by $ 11506(c)(2)(B)(iv)." Id., at618-619; see also American Trucking Associations--Petition for Declaratory Order--Single State Insurance Registration, 9 I. C. C. 2d 1184, 1192, 1194-1195 (1993).

NARUCv. ICC, 41 F. 3d 721 (1994). The United States Court of Ap-peals for the District of Columbia concluded that the plainlanguage of the statute supported the ICC's determinationthat States participating in the new system must considerreciprocity agreements under 49 U. S. C. $ 11506(c)(2)(B)(iv).41 F. 3d, at 729.BPrior to the implementation of the Single State Registra-tion System, Michigan had participated in the "bingo card"regime. See App. 5 (Affidavit of Thomas R. Lonergan, Di-rector, Motor Carrier Regulation Division of the MichiganPublic Service Commission || 3e) (hereinafter Lonergan Af-fidavit). The Michigan Legislature had directed the Michigan Public Service Commission to levy an annual regis-tration fee of $10 per vehicle on interstate motor carriervehicles and simultaneously endowed the commission withauthority to "enter into a reciprocal agreement with a state."Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. $ 478.7(4) (West 1988). Pursuant tosuch reciprocal agreements, the commission was empoweredto "waive the fee [otherwise] required." Ibid.Petitioner in this case is an interstate trucking companyheadquartered in Kansas. For calendar years 1990 and1991, the Michigan Public Service Commission did not levy afee for petitioner's trucks that were licensed in Illinois pur-suant to its policy "not to charge a fee to carriers with vehicles registered in states . . . which did not charge Michigan-based carriers a fee." App. 6 (Lonergan Affidavit || 3i). In1991, however, the Michigan Public Service Commission an-nounced a change in its reciprocity policy to take effect onFebruary 1, 1992. Under the new policy, the commissiongranted reciprocity treatment based on the policies of theState in which a carrier maintained its principal place of537US1 Unit: $$U6 [04-14-04 19:21:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN43Cite as: 537 U. S. 36 (2002)Opinion of the Courtbusiness rather than the State in which individual vehicleswere licensed. Because Michigan had no reciprocal arrangement with Kansas, the Michigan Public Service Commissionsent petitioner a bill in September 1991, levying a fee of $10per vehicle for the 1992 registration year on petitioner's entire fleet, with payment due on January 1, 1992.Petitioner paid the fees in October 1991 under protest andlater brought suit in the Michigan Court of Claims seeking arefund of the fees it paid for its Illinois-licensed vehiclesafter the Single State Registration System came into effect.See 49 U. S. C. $ 11506(c)(3) (1994 ed.) (setting effective dateof January 1, 1994). Petitioner alleged that, because Michigan had not "collected or charged" a fee for the 1991 registration year for trucks licensed in Illinois, ISTEA's fee-capprovision prohibits Michigan from levying a fee on Illinoislicensed trucks.On cross motions for summary disposition, the MichiganCourt of Claims ruled in favor of petitioner. Yellow FreightSystem, Inc. v. Michigan, No. 95-15706-CM (Mar. 13, 1996)(Yellow Freight System I). The Court of Claims' holdingrelied on an ICC declaratory order in which the agency heldthat ISTEA's fee-cap provision caps fees at the level "collected or charged" for registration year 1991, not those feeslevied for registration year 1992 in advance of the statutorycutoff date. Id., at 3-4; see American Trucking Associations, supra, at 1192, 1195.The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed on similargrounds. Yellow Freight System, Inc. v. Michigan, 231Mich. App. 194, 585 N. W. 2d 762 (1998) (Yellow Freight System II). The Court of Appeals also rejected Michigan's argument that States need not consider reciprocity agreementsin determining the level of fees "charged or collected as ofNovember 15, 1991," noting that the ICC had determinedreciprocity agreements must be considered, and that theagency's decision had been upheld in NARUC v.

The court concludedthat "reciprocity agreements are not relevant in determiningwhat fee [a State] `charged or collected' as of November 15,1991." Id., at 33, 627 N. W. 2d, at 242. The court expresslyrejected the District of Columbia Circuit's contrary conclusion. Id., at 29, 627 N. W. 2d, at 240 (citing NARUC v. ICC,supra). The Court applied Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. NaturalResources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984), butdetermined that the statute unambiguously forbids the ICC'sinterpretation. Yellow Freight System III, 464 Mich., at29-31, 627 N. W. 2d, at 240-241. Reasoning that "[t]he new`fee system' is based not on the fees collected from one individual company, but on the fee system that the state had inplace on November 15, 1991," the court concluded that "[w]emust look not at the fees paid by [petitioner] in any givenyear, but at the generic fee Michigan charged or collectedfrom carriers as of November 15, 1991." Id., at 31, 627 N. W.2d, at 241 (emphasis added). Two justices dissented, findingISTEA's fee-cap provision ambiguous, the ICC's constructionreasonable, and deference therefore due. Id., at 33-43, 627N. W. 2d, at 242-247 (opinions of Kelly and Cavanagh, JJ.).The Michigan Supreme Court did not consider respondents' argument that the fees petitioner paid Michigan for the1992 registration year were "collected or charged as of November 15, 1991." 49 U.

In ISTEA, Congress made anexpress delegation of authority to the ICC to promulgatestandards for implementing the new Single State Registration System. 49 U. S. C. $ 11506(c)(1) (1994 ed.). The ICCdid so, interpreting ISTEA's fee-cap provision subsequent toa notice-and-comment rulemaking. See United States v.Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 229 (2001) ("[A] very good indica-tor of delegation meriting Chevron treatment [is an] expresscongressional authorizatio[n] to engage in the process of rule-making or adjudication that produces regulations or rulingsfor which deference is claimed"). The Federal Highway Ad-ministration adopted the ICC's regulations, seesupra, at 39,n., and the Single State Registration System is now administered by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.49 U. S. C. $ 113.Accordingly, the question before us is whether the text ofthe statute resolves the issue, or, if not, whether the ICC'sinterpretation is permissible in light of the deference to beaccorded the agency under the statutory scheme. If thestatute speaks clearly "to the precise question at issue," we"must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent ofCongress." Chevron, 467 U. S., at 842-843. If the statuteis instead "silent or ambiguous with respect to the specificissue," we must sustain the agency's interpretation if it is"based on a permissible construction of the statute."Id., at843; see Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U. S. 212, 217-218 (2002).ISTEA's fee-cap provision does not foreclose the ICC's de-termination that fees charged under States' pre-existing reciprocity agreements were, in effect, frozen by the new SingleState Registration System. The provision requires that thenew system "result in a fee for each participating State thatis equal to the fee, not to exceed $10 per vehicle, that suchState collected or charged as of November 15, 1991." 49U. S. C. $ 14504(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III). The language "collected or537US1 Unit: $$U6 [04-14-04 19:21:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN46 YELLOW TRANSP., INC. v. MICHIGANOpinion of the Courtcharged" can quite naturally be read to mean fees that aStateactually collected or charged. The statute thus caneasily be read as the ICC chose, making it unlawful "for aState to renounce or modify a reciprocity agreement so as toalter any fee charged or collected as of November 15, 1991,under the predecessor registration system."AmericanTrucking Associations, 9 I. C. C. 2d, at 1194; see Single StateInsurance Registration, 9 I. C. C. 2d, at 618-619.The Michigan Supreme Court held that the language ofISTEA's fee-cap provision compels a different result. Al-though it acknowledged that ISTEA is silent with respect toreciprocity agreements, the court nonetheless concluded thatthe fee-cap provision mandates that those agreements haveno bearing in the determination of what fee a State "collected or charged" as of November 15, 1991. Yellow FreightSystem III, 464 Mich., at 31, 627 N. W. 2d, at 241. The courtreasoned that the Single State Registration System was"based not on the fees collected from one individual company,but on the fee system that the state had in place." Ibid.(emphasis added). While such a reading might be reasonable, nothing in the statute compels that particular result.The fee-cap provision refers not to a "fee system," butto the "fee . . . collected or charged. " 49 U. S. C.$ 14504(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III). Under the ICC's rule, where aState waives its registration fee, its "fee . . . collected orcharged" is zero and must remain zero. The ICC's interpretation is a permissible reading of the language of the statute.And, because there is statutory ambiguity and the agency'sinterpretation is reasonable, its interpretation must receivedeference. See Chevron, supra, at 843.As commenters to the ICC during the rulemaking pointedout, to allow States to disavow their reciprocity agreementsso as to alter any fee charged or collected as of November15, 1991, would potentially permit States to increase theirrevenues substantially under the new system, a result thatthe ICC quite reasonably believed Congress did not intend.537US1 Unit: $$U6 [04-14-04 19:21:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN47Cite as: 537 U. S. 36 (2002)Opinion of the CourtSee Single State Insurance Registration, 9 I. C. C. 2d, at618. The ICC concluded that its rule best served the "intent of the law that the flow of revenue for the States bemaintained while the burden of the registration system forcarriers be reduced." Ibid. The agency considered thatallowing States to disavow reciprocity agreements andcharge a single, uniform fee might reduce administrativeburdens, but expressed concern that carriers' registrationcosts, and state revenues, would balloon. Ibid. (noting thatsome carriers' fees "assertedly could increase as much as900%," and that one commenter presented a "worst casescenario" in which "State revenues could increase from $50million to $200 million").Respondents argue that Congress intended for each Stateto set a single, uniform fee. While such a mandate would,indeed, have simplified the new system, it is not compelledby the language of the statute, which instructs the ICC toimplement a system under which States charge a fee, not toexceed $10 per vehicle, that is equal to the fee such States"collected or charged as of November 15, 1991."Respondents also contend that, by freezing the feescharged under reciprocity agreements as part of the fee cap,the ICC added a constraint not within the express languageof the statute. The Michigan Supreme Court expressed asimilar concern, stating that "[i]t is not for the ICC . . . toinsert words into the statute." 464 Mich., at 32, 627 N. W.2d, at 241-242. It was precisely Congress' command, however, that the ICC promulgate standards to govern the Single State Registration System, 49 U. S. C. $ 11506(c) (1994ed.), and it was thus for that agency to resolve any ambiguities and fill in any holes in the statutory scheme. See MeadCorp., supra, at 229; Chevron, supra, at 843-844. To holdStates to the fees they actually collected or charged seemsto us a reasonable interpretation of the statute's commandthat state fees be "equal to the fee, not to exceed $10 per537US1 Unit: $$U6 [04-14-04 19:21:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN48 YELLOW TRANSP., INC. v. MICHIGANStevens, J., concurring in judgmentvehicle, that such State collected or charged as of November15, 1991." 49 U. S. C. $ 14504(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III).Respondents argue that the ICC's rule contravenesISTEA's fee-cap provision by limiting what a State cancharge based on what was collected from or charged to aparticular carrier. Respondents point out that the focus ofthe provision is on the actions of the State, not the actionsof any particular carrier. While we agree that the statutefocuses on what States "collected or charged" rather thanwhat particular carriers paid, we do not agree that the ICC'srule focuses the inquiry on the latter. Under the "bingocard" regime, States entered into reciprocity agreementsthat waived or reduced fees charged to particular categoriesof vehicles. The ICC's rule does not necessarily cap the aggregate fee paid by any particular carrier; rather, it simplyrequires States to preserve fees at the levels they actuallycollected or charged pursuant to reciprocity agreements inplace as of November 15, 1991.Because the ICC's interpretation of ISTEA's fee-cap provision is consistent with the language of the statute and reasonably resolves any ambiguity therein, see Chevron, 467U. S., at 843, the Michigan Supreme Court erred in decliningto enforce it.The judgment is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded to the Michigan Supreme Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
