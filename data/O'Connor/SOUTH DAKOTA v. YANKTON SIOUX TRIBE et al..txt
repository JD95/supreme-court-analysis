This case presents the question whether, in an 1894 statutethat ratified an agreement for the sale of surplus tribal lands,Congress diminished the boundaries of the Yankton SiouxReservation in South Dakota. The reservation was established pursuant to an 1858 Treaty between the United Statesand the Yankton Sioux Tribe. Subsequently, under the Indian General Allotment Act, Act of Feb. 8, 1887, 24 Stat.388, 25 U. S. C. $ 331 (Dawes Act), individual members ofthe Tribe received allotments of reservation land, and theGovernment then negotiated with the Tribe for the cessionof the remaining, unallotted lands. The issue we confrontillustrates the jurisdictional quandaries wrought by the allotment policy: We must decide whether a landfill con-structed on non-Indian fee land that falls within the boundaries of the original Yankton Reservation remains subjectto federal environmental regulations. If the divestiture ofIndian property in 1894 effected a diminishment of Indianterritory, then the ceded lands no longer constitute "Indiancountry" as defined by 18 U. S. C. $ 1151(a), and the Statenow has primary jurisdiction over them. In light of theoperative language of the 1894 Act, and the circumstancessurrounding its passage, we hold that Congress intended todiminish the Yankton Reservation and consequently thatthe waste site is not in Indian country.IAAt the outset of the 19th century, the Yankton Sioux Tribeheld exclusive dominion over 13 million acres of landbetween the Des Moines and Missouri Rivers, near theboundary that currently divides North and South Dakota.H.

See Letter from the Commissioner of IndianAffairs to the Secretary of the Interior (Dec. 9, 1893), reprinted in S. Exec. Doc. No. 27, 53d Cong., 2d Sess., 5 (1894)(hereinafter Letter). In consideration for the cession oflands and release of claims, the United States pledged to protect the Yankton Tribe in their "quiet and peaceable possession" of this reservation and agreed that "[n]o white person,"with narrow exceptions, would "be permitted to reside ormake any settlement upon any part of the [reservation]."Arts.

The Federal Government further promised to pay the Tribe, or expend for the benefit ofmembers of the Tribe, $1.6 million over a 50-year period,and appropriated an additional $50,000 to aid the Tribe in itstransition to the reservation through the purchase of livestock and agricultural implements, and the construction ofhouses, schools, and other buildings.522US2 Unit: $U20 [01-28-00 16:15:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN335Cite as: 522 U. S. 329 (1998)Opinion of the CourtNot all of this assistance was forthcoming, and the Tribeexperienced severe financial difficulties in the years that followed, compounded by weather cycles of drought and devastating floods. When war broke out between the UnitedStates and the Sioux Nation in 1862, the Yankton Tribe alonesided with the Federal Government, a decision that isolatedit from the rest of the Sioux Federation and caused severeinner turmoil as well. The Tribe's difficulties coincided witha period of rapid growth in the United States' population,increasing westward migration, and ensuing demands fromnon-Indians to open Indian holdings throughout the WesternStates to settlement.In response to these "familiar forces," DeCoteau v. DistrictCounty Court for Tenth Judicial Dist., 420 U. S. 425, 431(1975), Congress retreated from the reservation concept andbegan to dismantle the territories that it had previously setaside as permanent and exclusive homes for Indian tribes.See Solem v. Bartlett, 465 U. S. 463, 466 (1984). The pressure from westward-bound homesteaders, and the belief thatthe Indians would benefit from private property ownership,prompted passage of the Dawes Act in 1887, 24 Stat. 388.The Dawes Act permitted the Federal Government to allottracts of tribal land to individual Indians and, with tribalconsent, to open the remaining holdings to non-Indian settlement. Within a generation or two, it was thought, thetribes would dissolve, their reservations would disappear,and individual Indians would be absorbed into the largercommunity of white settlers.

No. 196, 53d Cong., 2d Sess., 1(1894).In accordance with the Dawes Act, each member of theYankton Tribe received a 160-acre tract from the existingreservation, held in trust by the United States for 25 years.Members of the Tribe acquired parcels of land throughoutthe 1858 reservation, although many of the allotments wereclustered in the southern part, near the Missouri River. By1890, the allotting agent had apportioned 167,325 acres ofreservation land, 95,000 additional acres were subsequentlyallotted under the Act of February 28, 1891, 26 Stat. 795, anda small amount of acreage was reserved for government andreligious purposes. The surplus amounted to approximately168,000 acres of unallotted lands. See Letter, at 5.In 1892, the Secretary of the Interior dispatched a threemember Yankton Indian Commission to Greenwood, SouthDakota, to negotiate for the acquisition of these surpluslands. See Act of July 13, 1892, 27 Stat. 137 (appropriatingfunds to enable the Secretary to "negotiate with any Indiansfor the surrender of portions of their respective reservations"). When the Commissioners arrived on the reservation in October 1892, they informed the Tribe that they hadbeen sent by the "Great Father" to discuss the cession of"this land that [members of the Tribe] hold in common,"Council of the Yankton Indians (Oct. 8, 1892), transcribed inS. Exec. Doc. No. 27, at 48, and they abruptly encounteredopposition to the sale from traditionalist tribal leaders. SeeReport of the Yankton Indian Commission (Mar. 31, 1893),reprinted in S. Exec. Doc. No. 27, at 9-11 (hereinafter Report). In the lengthy negotiations that followed, membersof the Tribe raised concerns about the suggested price peracre, the preservation of their annuities under the 1858Treaty, and other outstanding claims against the UnitedStates, but they did not discuss the future boundaries of the522US2 Unit: $U20 [01-28-00 16:15:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN337Cite as: 522 U. S. 329 (1998)Opinion of the Courtreservation. Once the Commissioners garnered a measureof support for the sale of the unallotted lands, they submitteda proposed agreement to the Tribe.11 The text of the agreement provides in relevant part:"Article I."The Yankton tribe of Dakota or Sioux Indians hereby cede, sell, relinquish, and convey to the United States all their claim, right, title, andinterest in and to all the unallotted lands within the limits of the reservation set apart to said Indians as aforesaid."Article II."In consideration for the lands ceded, sold, relinquished, and conveyedto the United States as aforesaid, the United States stipulates and agreesto pay to the said Yankton tribe of Sioux Indians the sum of six hundredthousand dollars ($600,000), as hereinbefore provided for.. . . . ."Article VII."In addition to the stipulations in the preceding articles, upon the ratification of this agreement by Congress, the United States shall pay to theYankton tribe of Sioux Indians as follows: To each person whose name issigned to this agreement and to each other male member of the tribe whois eighteen years old or older at the date of this agreement, twenty dollars($20) in one double eagle, struck in the year 1892 as a memorial of thisagreement. . . ."Article VIII."Such part of the surplus lands hereby ceded and sold to the UnitedStates as may now be occupied by the United States for agency, schools,and other purposes, shall be reserved from sale to settlers until they areno longer required for such purposes.

YANKTON SIOUX TRIBEOpinion of the CourtArticle I of the agreement provided that the Tribe would"cede, sell, relinquish, and convey to the United States" allof the unallotted lands on the reservation. Pursuant to Ar-ticle II, the United States agreed to compensate the Tribein a single payment of $600,000, which amounted to $3.60 peracre.2 Much of the agreement focused on the payment anddisposition of that sum. Article VII further provided thatall the signatories and adult male members of the Tribewould receive a $20 gold piece to commemorate the agree-ment. Some members of the Tribe also sought unpaidwages from their service as scouts in the Sioux War, and inArticle XV, the United States recognized their claim. Thesaving clause in Article XVIII, the core of the current dis-agreement between the parties to this case, stated that nothof this agreement by Congress the same shall be paid in lawful money ofthe United States to the said scouts or to their heirs.. . . . ."Article XVII."No intoxicating liquors nor other intoxicants shall ever be sold or givenaway upon any of the lands by this agreement ceded and sold to the UnitedStates, nor upon any other lands within or comprising the reservations ofthe Yankton Sioux or Dakota Indians as described in the treaty betweenthe said Indians and the United States, dated April 19th, 1858, and asafterwards surveyed and set off to the said Indians. The penalty for theviolation of this provision shall be such as Congress may prescribe in theact ratifying this agreement."Article XVIII."Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to abrogate the treaty ofApril 19th, 1858, between the Yankton tribe of Sioux Indians and theUnited States. And after the signing of this agreement, and its ratification by Congress, all provisions of the said treaty of April 19th, 1858, shallbe in full force and effect, the same as though this agreement had not beenmade, and the said Yankton Indians shall continue to receive their annuities under the said treaty of April 19th, 1858." 28 Stat. 314-318.2 In 1980, the Court of Claims concluded that the land ceded by the Tribehad a fair market value of $6.65 per acre, or $1,337,381.50, that the $600,000paid pursuant to the 1892 agreement was "unconscionable and grosslyinadequate," and that the Tribe was entitled to recover the difference.Yankton Sioux Tribe v.

The Yankton Indian Commission filed its report inMay 1893, but congressional consideration was delayed by aninvestigation into allegations of fraud in the procurement ofsignatures. On August 15, 1894, Congress finally ratifiedthe 1892 agreement, together with similar surplus land saleagreements between the United States and the Siletz andNez Perce Tribes. Act of Aug. 15, 1894, 28 Stat. 286. The1894 Act incorporated the 1892 agreement in its entirety andappropriated the necessary funds to compensate the Tribefor the ceded lands, to satisfy the claims for scout pay, andto award the commemorative $20 gold pieces. Congress alsoprescribed the punishment for violating a liquor prohibitionincluded in the agreement and reserved certain sections ineach township for common-school purposes. Ibid.President Cleveland issued a proclamation opening theceded lands to settlement as of May 21, 1895, and non-Indiansrapidly acquired them. By the turn of the century, 90 percent of the unallotted tracts had been settled. See YanktonSioux Tribe v. United States, 623 F. 2d 159, 171 (Ct. Cl. 1980).A majority of the individual allotments granted to membersof the Tribe also were subsequently conveyed in fee by themembers to non-Indians. Today, the total Indian holdingsin the region consist of approximately 30,000 acres of allottedland and 6,000 acres of tribal land.

C.$ 461, the policy favoring assimilation of Indian tribesthrough the allotment of reservation land left behind a last522US2 Unit: $U20 [01-28-00 16:15:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN340 SOUTH DAKOTA v. YANKTON SIOUX TRIBEOpinion of the Courting legacy. The conflict between the modern-day approachto tribal self-determination and the assimilation impetus ofthe allotment era has engendered "a spate of jurisdictionaldisputes between state and federal officials as to which sovereign has authority over lands that were opened by the[surplus land] Acts and have since passed out of Indian ownership." Solem, 465 U. S., at 467.BWe confront such a dispute in the instant case, in whichtribal, federal, and state officials disagree as to the environmental regulations applicable to a proposed waste site.In February 1992, several South Dakota counties formedthe Southern Missouri Recycling and Waste ManagementDistrict (hereinafter Waste District) for the purpose ofconstructing a municipal solid waste disposal facility. TheWaste District acquired the site for the landfill, which fallswithin the 1858 boundaries of the Yankton Sioux Reserva-tion, in fee from a non-Indian. The predicate for the parties'claims in this case is that the waste site lies on land cededin the 1894 Act, and the record supports that assumption.In the Tribe's complaint, the proposed landfill is describedas "the south one-half north one-quarter (S1/2 N1/4), Section6, Township 96 North, Range 65 West (S6, T96N, R65W) ofthe Fifth Principal Meridan[sic], Charles Mix County, SouthDakota." App. 24. That description corresponds to the account of a tract of land deeded to Lars K. Langeland underthe Homestead Act in 1904. See App. to Brief for Respondent Southern Missouri Waste Management District 1a-2a.Because all of the land allotted to individual Indians on theYankton Reservation was inalienable, pursuant to the DawesAct, during a 25-year trust period, the tract acquired by ahomesteader in 1904 and currently owned by the Waste Dis-trict must consist of unallotted land ceded in the 1894 Act.(The Dawes Act was amended in 1906 by the Burke Act, 34Stat. 182, 25 U. S. C. $ 349, which permitted the issuance of522US2 Unit: $U20 [01-28-00 16:15:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN341Cite as: 522 U. S. 329 (1998)Opinion of the Courtsome fee-simple patents before the expiration of the 25-yeartrust period, but the restrictions on alienation remained inplace as of 1904.)When the Waste District sought a state permit for thelandfill, the Yankton Tribe intervened and objected on environmental grounds, arguing that the proposed compactedclay liner was inadequate to prevent leakage. After an administrative hearing in December 1993, the State Board ofMinerals and the Environment granted the solid waste permit, finding that South Dakota regulations did not requirethe installation of the synthetic composite liner the Tribe hadrequested. The Sixth Judicial Circuit affirmed the Board'sdecision, and no appeal was taken to the State SupremeCourt.In September 1994, the Tribe filed suit in the Federal District Court for the District of South Dakota to enjoin construction of the landfill, and the Waste District joined SouthDakota as a third party so that the State could defend itsjurisdiction to grant the permit. The Tribe also sought adeclaratory judgment that the permit did not comport withFederal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations mandating the installation of a composite liner in thelandfill. See 40 CFR $ 258.40(b) (1997). The District Courtheld, in accordance with our decision in South Dakota v.Bourland, 508 U. S. 679, 692 (1993), that the Tribe itselfcould not assert regulatory jurisdiction over the non-Indianactivity on fee lands. Furthermore, because the Tribe didnot establish that the landfill would compromise the "politicalintegrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare ofthe tribe," the court concluded that the Tribe could not invoke its inherent sovereignty under the exceptions in Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544, 566 (1981). Accordingly,the court declined to enjoin the landfill project, a decision theTribe does not appeal. The District Court also determined,however, that the 1894 Act did not diminish the exteriorboundaries of the reservation as delineated in the 1858522US2 Unit: $U20 [01-28-00 16:15:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN342 SOUTH DAKOTA v. YANKTON SIOUX TRIBEOpinion of the CourtTreaty between the United States and the Tribe, and consequently that the waste site lies within an Indian reservationwhere federal environmental regulations apply.On appeal by the State,3 a divided panel of the Court ofAppeals for the Eighth Circuit agreed that "Congress intended by its 1894 Act that the Yankton Sioux sell theirsurplus land to the government, but not their governmentalauthority over it." 99 F. 3d 1439, 1457 (1996). The courtrelied primarily on the saving clause in Article XVIII, reasoning that, given its "unusually expansive language," othersections of the 1894 Act "should be read narrowly to minimize any conflict with the 1858 treaty." Id., at 1447. Thecourt further concluded that neither the historical evidencenor the demographic development of the area could sustaina finding of diminishment. Id., at 1457.We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict between the decision of the Court of Appeals and a number of decisions ofthe South Dakota Supreme Court declaring that the reservation has been diminished.4 520 U. S. 1263 (1997). We nowreverse the Eighth Circuit's decision and hold that the unallotted lands ceded as a result of the 1894 Act did not retainreservation status.3 The Waste District explains that it did not appeal because the DistrictCourt's decision allowed it to go forward with construction of the proposedlandfill, but it filed a brief as a respondent supporting the petitioner Statein this Court because "of the likelihood that the assertion of tribal jurisdiction will continue to affect the District in this or similar contexts." Brieffor Respondent Southern Missouri Waste Management District 6, n. 6.With respect to the particular issue of the landfill's liner, the Waste District's concerns appear academic. The EPA has waived the requirementof a composite liner and has permitted construction to go forward withthe compacted clay liner. See Yankton Sioux Tribe v. EnvironmentalProtection Agency, 950 F. Supp. 1471, 1482 (SD 1996).4 See State v. Greger, 559 N. W. 2d 854 (S. D. 1997); see also State v.Thompson, 355 N. W. 2d 349, 350 (S. D. 1984); State v. Williamson, 87S. D. 512, 515, 211 N.

S. 329 (1998)Opinion of the CourtIIStates acquired primary jurisdiction over unallottedopened lands where "the applicable surplus land Act freedthat land of its reservation status and thereby diminishedthe reservation boundaries."Solem, 465 U. S., at 467. Incontrast, if a surplus land Act "simply offered non-Indiansthe opportunity to purchase land within established reser-vation boundaries," id., at 470, then the entire opened arearemained Indian country. Our touchstone to determinewhether a given statute diminished or retained reservationboundaries is congressional purpose. See Rosebud SiouxTribe v. Kneip, 430 U. S. 584, 615 (1977). Congress pos-sesses plenary power over Indian affairs, including the powerto modify or eliminate tribal rights. See, e. g., Santa ClaraPueblo v. Martinez, 436 U. S. 49, 56 (1978). Accordingly,only Congress can alter the terms of an Indian treaty bydiminishing a reservation,United States v. Celestine, 215U. S. 278, 285 (1909), and its intent to do so must be "clearand plain," United States v. Dion, 476 U. S. 734, 738-739(1986).Here, we must determine whether Congress intended bythe 1894 Act to modify the reservation set aside for theYankton Tribe in the 1858 Treaty. Our inquiry is informedby the understanding that, at the turn of this century, Congress did not view the distinction between acquiring Indianproperty and assuming jurisdiction over Indian territory asa critical one, in part because "[t]he notion that reservationstatus of Indian lands might not be coextensive with tribalownership was unfamiliar," Solem, 465 U. S., at 468, and inpart because Congress then assumed that the reservationsystem would fade over time. "Given this expectation, Con-gress naturally failed to be meticulous in clarifying whethera particular piece of legislation formally sliced a certain par-cel of land off one reservation." Ibid.; see also Hagen v.Utah, 510 U. S. 399, 426 (1994) (Blackmun, J., dissenting) ("Asa result of the patina history has placed on the allotment522US2 Unit: $U20 [01-28-00 16:15:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN344 SOUTH DAKOTA v. YANKTON SIOUX TRIBEOpinion of the CourtActs, the Court is presented with questions that their archi-tects could not have foreseen"). Thus, although "[t]he mostprobative evidence of diminishment is, of course, the statu-tory language used to open the Indian lands," we have heldthat we will also consider "the historical context surroundingthe passage of the surplus land Acts," and, to a lesser extent,the subsequent treatment of the area in question and thepattern of settlement there.Id., at 411. Throughout thisinquiry, "we resolve any ambiguities in favor of the Indians,and we will not lightly find diminishment." Ibid.AArticle I of the 1894 Act provides that the Tribe will "cede,sell, relinquish, and convey to the United States all theirclaim, right, title, and interest in and to all the unallottedlands within the limits of the reservation"; pursuant to Article II, the United States pledges a fixed payment of $600,000in return. This "cession" and "sum certain" language is"precisely suited" to terminating reservation status. SeeDeCoteau, 420 U. S., at 445. Indeed, we have held thatwhen a surplus land Act contains both explicit language ofcession, evidencing "the present and total surrender of alltribal interests," and a provision for a fixed-sum payment,representing "an unconditional commitment from Congressto compensate the Indian tribe for its opened land," a "nearlyconclusive," or "almost insurmountable," presumption of diminishment arises. Solem, supra, at 470; see also Hagen,supra, at 411.The terms of the 1894 Act parallel the language that thisCourt found terminated the Lake Traverse Indian Reserva-tion inDeCoteau, supra, at 445, and, as in DeCoteau, the1894 Act ratified a negotiated agreement supported by a majority of the Tribe. Moreover, the Act we construe heremore clearly indicates diminishment than did the surplusland Act at issue in Hagen, which we concluded diminishedreservation lands even though it provided only that "all the522US2 Unit: $U20 [01-28-00 16:15:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN345Cite as: 522 U. S. 329 (1998)Opinion of the Courtunallotted lands within said reservation shall be restored tothe public domain." See 510 U. S., at 412.The 1894 Act is also readily distinguishable from surplusland Acts that the Court has interpreted as maintaining reservation boundaries. In both Seymour v. Superintendent ofWash. State Penitentiary, 368 U. S. 351, 355 (1962), andMattz v. Arnett, 412 U. S. 481, 501-502 (1973), we held thatActs declaring surplus land "subject to settlement, entry, andpurchase," without more, did not evince congressional intentto diminish the reservations. Likewise, in Solem, we didnot read a phrase authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to"sell and dispose" of surplus lands belonging to the CheyenneRiver Sioux as language of cession. See 465 U. S., at 472.In contrast, the 1894 Act at issue here--a negotiated agree-ment providing for the total surrender of tribal claims inexchange for a fixed payment--bears the hallmarks of con-gressional intent to diminish a reservation.BThe Yankton Tribe and the United States, appearing asamicus for the Tribe, rest their argument against diminish-ment primarily on the saving clause in Article XVIII of the1894 Act. The Tribe asserts that because that clause pur-ported to conserve the provisions of the 1858 Treaty, theexisting reservation boundaries were maintained. TheUnited States urges a similarly "holistic" construction of theagreement, which would presume that the parties intendedto modify the 1858 Treaty only insofar as necessary to openthe surplus lands for settlement, without fundamentally al-tering the treaty's terms.Such a literal construction of the saving clause, as theSouth Dakota Supreme Court noted in State v. Greger, 559N. W. 2d 854, 863 (1997), would "impugn the entire sale."The unconditional relinquishment of the Tribe's territory forsettlement by non-Indian homesteaders can by no means bereconciled with the central provisions of the 1858 Treaty,522US2 Unit: $U20 [01-28-00 16:15:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN346 SOUTH DAKOTA v. YANKTON SIOUX TRIBEOpinion of the Courtwhich recognized the reservation as the Tribe's "permanent"home and prohibited white settlement there. See OregonDept. of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath Tribe, 473 U. S. 753,770 (1985) (discounting a saving clause on the basis of a "glaring inconsistency" between the original treaty and the subse-quent agreement). Moreover, the Government's contentionthat the Tribe intended to cede some property but maintainthe entire reservation as its territory contradicts the common understanding of the time: that tribal ownership was acritical component of reservation status. SeeSolem, supra,at 468. We "cannot ignore plain language that, viewed inhistorical context and given a fair appraisal, clearly runscounter to a tribe's later claims."Klamath, supra, at 774(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).Rather than read the saving clause in a manner that evis-cerates the agreement in which it appears, we give it a "sensible construction" that avoids this "absurd conclusion."See United States v. Granderson, 511 U. S. 39, 56 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). The most plausible inter-pretation of Article XVIII revolves around the annuities inthe form of cash, guns, ammunition, food, and clothing thatthe Tribe was to receive in exchange for its aboriginal claimsfor 50 years after the 1858 Treaty. Along with the proposedsale price, these annuities and other unrealized Yanktonclaims dominated the 1892 negotiations between the Com-missioners and the Tribe. The tribal historian testified, before the District Court, that the loss of their rations wouldhave been "disastrous" to the Tribe, App. 589, and membersof the Tribe clearly perceived a threat to the annuities. Ata particularly tense point in the negotiations, when the tideseemed to turn in favor of forces opposing the sale, Commis-sioner John J. Cole warned:"I want you to understand that you are absolutely de-pendent upon the Great Father to-day for a living. Letthe Government send out instructions to your agent tocease to issue these rations, let the Government instruct522US2 Unit: $U20 [01-28-00 16:15:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN347Cite as: 522 U.

No. 27, at 74.Given the Tribe's evident concern with reaffirmance of theGovernment's obligations under the 1858 Treaty, and theCommissioners' tendency to wield the payments as an in-ducement to sign the agreement, we conclude that the savingclause pertains to the continuance of annuities, not the 1858borders.The language in Article XVIII specifically ensuring thatthe "Yankton Indians shall continue to receive their annuitiesunder the [1858 Treaty]" underscores the limited purposeand scope of the saving clause. It is true that the Courtavoids interpreting statutes in a way that "renders somewords altogether redundant."Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513U. S. 561, 574 (1995). But in light of the fact that the recordof the negotiations between the Commissioners and theYankton Tribe contains no discussion of the preservation ofthe 1858 boundaries but many references to the Govern-ment's failure to fulfill earlier promises, see, e. g., Council ofthe Yankton Indians (Dec. 3, 1892), transcribed in S. Exec.Doc. No. 27, at 54-55, it seems most likely that the partiesinserted and understood Article XVIII, including both thegeneral statement regarding the force of the 1858 Treaty andthe particular provision that payments would continue asspecified therein, to assuage the Tribes' concerns about theirpast claims and future entitlements.522US2 Unit: $U20 [01-28-00 16:15:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN348 SOUTH DAKOTA v. YANKTON SIOUX TRIBEOpinion of the CourtIndeed, apart from the pledge to pay annuities, it is hardto identify any provision in the 1858 Treaty that the Tribemight have sought to preserve, other than those plainly inconsistent with or expressly included in the 1894 Act. TheGovernment points to Article XI of the treaty, in which theTribe agreed to submit for federal resolution "all matters ofdispute and difficulty between themselves and other Indians," 11 Stat. 747, and urges us to extrapolate from this provision that the Tribe implicitly retained jurisdiction over internal matters, and from there to apply the standard canonof Indian law that "[o]nce powers of tribal self-governmentor other Indian rights are shown to exist, by treaty or otherwise, later federal action which might arguably abridge themis construed narrowly in favor of retaining Indian rights."F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 224 (1982) (hereinafter Cohen). But the treaty's reference to tribal authority is indirect, at best, and it does not persuade us to view thesaving clause as an agreement to maintain exclusive tribalgovernance within the original reservation boundaries.The Tribe further contends that because Article XVIII affirms that the 1858 Treaty will govern "the same as though[the 1892 agreement] had not been made," without referenceto consistency between those agreements, it has more forcethan the standard saving clause. While the language of thesaving clause is indeed unusual, we do not think it is meaningfully distinct from the saving clauses that have failed tomove this Court to find that pre-existing treaties remain ineffect under comparable circumstances. See, e. g., Klamath,473 U. S., at 769-770; Montana, 450 U. S., at 548, 558-559;Rosebud, 430 U. S., at 623 (Marshall, J., dissenting). Furthermore, "it is a commonplace of statutory construction thatthe specific" cession and sum certain language in Articles Iand II "governs the general" terms of the saving clause.See Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U. S. 374,384 (1992).522US2 Unit: $U20 [01-28-00 16:15:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN349Cite as: 522 U. S. 329 (1998)Opinion of the CourtFinally, the Tribe argues that, at a minimum, the savingclause renders the statute equivocal, and that confrontedwith that ambiguity we must adopt the reading that favorsthe Tribe. See Carpenter v. Shaw, 280 U. S. 363, 367 (1930).The principle according to which ambiguities are resolvedto the benefit of Indian tribes is not, however, "a license todisregard clear expressions of tribal and congressional in-tent."DeCoteau, 420 U. S., at 447; see also South Carolinav. Catawba Tribe, Inc., 476 U. S. 498, 506 (1986). In previousdecisions, this Court has recognized that the precise cessionand sum certain language contained in the 1894 Act plainlyindicates diminishment, and a reasonable interpretation ofthe saving clause does not conflict with a like conclusion inthis case. CBoth the State and the Tribe seek support for their respec-tive positions in two other provisions of the 1894 Act: aclause reserving sections of each township for schools and aprohibition on liquor within the ceded lands. Upon ratification, Congress added that "the sixteenth and thirty-sixthsections in each Congressional township . . . shall be reservedfor common-school purposes and be subject to the laws of theState of South Dakota." 28 Stat. 319. This "school sectionsclause" parallels the enabling Act admitting South Dakota tothe Union, which grants the State sections 16 and 36 in everytownship for the support of common schools, but expresslyexempts reservation land "until the reservation shall havebeen extinguished and such lands restored to . . . the publicdomain." Act of Feb. 22, 1889, 25 Stat. 679. When considering a similar provision included in the Act ceding the Rose-bud Sioux Reservation in South Dakota, the Court discernedcongressional intent to diminish the reservation, "therebymaking the sections available for disposition to the State ofSouth Dakota for `school sections.' " Rosebud, supra, at 601.The Tribe argues that the clause in the 1894 Act specifyingthe application of state law would be superfluous if Congress522US2 Unit: $U20 [01-28-00 16:15:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN350 SOUTH DAKOTA v. YANKTON SIOUX TRIBEOpinion of the Courtintended to diminish the reservation. As the Court statedinDeCoteau, however, "the natural inference would be thatstate law is to govern the manner in which the 16th and 36thsections are to be employed `for common school purposes,' "which "implies nothing about the presence or absence ofstate civil and criminal jurisdiction over the remainder ofthe ceded lands." 420 U. S., at 446, n. 33.Although we agree with the State that the school sectionsclause reinforces the view that Congress intended to extinguish the reservation status of the unallotted land, a some-what contradictory provision counsels against finding thereservation terminated. Article VIII of the 1894 Act reserved from sale those surplus lands "as may now be occupied by the United States for agency, schools, and other purposes." In Solem, the Court noted with respect to virtuallyidentical language that "[i]t is difficult to imagine why Congress would have reserved lands for such purposes if it didnot anticipate that the opened area would remain part of thereservation." 465 U. S., at 474.The State's position is more persuasively supported by theliquor prohibition included in Article XVII of the agreement.The provision prohibits the sale or offering of "intoxicatingliquors" on "any of the lands by this agreement ceded andsold to the United States" or "any other lands within or comprising the reservations of the Yankton Sioux or Dakota Indians as described in the [1858] treaty," 28 Stat. 318, thussignaling a jurisdictional distinction between reservationand ceded land. The Commissioners' report recommendsthat Congress "fix a penalty for the violation of this provision which will make it most effective in preventing the introduction of intoxicants within the limits of the reservation," Report, at 21, which could be read to suggest thatceded lands remained part of the reservation. We conclude,however, that "the most reasonable inference from the inclusion of this provision is that Congress was aware that theopened, unallotted areas would henceforth not be `Indian522US2 Unit: $U20 [01-28-00 16:15:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN351Cite as: 522 U. S. 329 (1998)Opinion of the Courtcountry.' " Rosebud, supra, at 613. By 1892, Congress al-ready had enacted laws prohibiting alcohol on Indian reservations, see Cohen 306-307, and "[w]e assume that Congressis aware of existing law when it passes legislation," Miles v.Apex Marine Corp., 498 U. S. 19, 32 (1990). Furthermore,the Commissioner of Indian Affairs described the provisionas prohibiting "the sale or disposition of intoxicants upon anyof the landsnow within the Yankton Reservation," Letter,at 6-7 (emphasis added), indicating that the lands would besevered from the reservation upon ratification of the agree-ment. In Perrin v. United States, 232 U. S. 478 (1914), weimplied that the lands conveyed by the 1894 Act lost theirreservation status when we construed Article XVII asapplying to "ceded lands formerly included in the YanktonSioux Indian Reservation."Id., at 480. We now reaffirmthat the terms of the 1894 Act, including both the explicitlanguage of cession and the surrounding provisions, attest toCongress' intent to diminish the Yankton Reservation.IIIAlthough we perceive congressional intent to diminish thereservation in the plain statutory language, we also takenote of the contemporary historical context, subsequent con-gressional and administrative references to the reservation,and demographic trends. Even in the absence of a clear ex-pression of congressional purpose in the text of a surplusland Act, unequivocal evidence derived from the surroundingcircumstances may support the conclusion that a reservationhas been diminished. See Solem, 465 U. S., at 471. In thiscase, although the context of the Act is not so compellingthat, standing alone, it would indicate diminishment, neitherdoes it rebut the "almost insurmountable presumption" thatarises from the statute's plain terms. Id., at 470.AThe "manner in which the transaction was negotiated"with the Yankton Tribe and "the tenor of legislative Reports522US2 Unit: $U20 [01-28-00 16:15:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN352 SOUTH DAKOTA v. YANKTON SIOUX TRIBEOpinion of the Courtpresented to Congress" reveal a contemporaneous understanding that the proposed legislation modified the reservation. Id., at 471. In 1892, when the Commissioner of Indian Affairs appointed the Yankton Commission, he chargedits members to "negotiate with the [Tribe] for the cession oftheir surplus lands" and noted that the funds exchanged forthe "relinquishment" of those lands would provide a futureincome for the Tribe. Instructions to the Yankton IndianCommission (July 27, 1892), reprinted in App. 98-99. Thenegotiations themselves confirm the understanding that bysurrendering its interest in the unallotted lands, the Tribewould alter the reservation's character. Commissioner J. C.Adams informed members of the Tribe that once surpluslands were sold to the "Great Father," the Tribe would "assist in making the laws which will govern [members of theTribe] as citizens of the State and nation." Council of theYankton Indians (Oct. 8, 1892), transcribed in S. Exec. Doc.No. 27, at 48. In terms that strongly suggest a reconceptionof the reservation, Commissioner Cole admonished the Tribe:"This reservation alone proclaims the old time and theold conditions . . . . The tide of civilization is as resistless as the tide of the ocean, and you have no choicebut to accept it and live according to its methods or bedestroyed by it. To accept it requires the sale of thesesurplus lands and the opening of this reservation towhite settlement."You were a great and powerful people when yourabilities and energies were directed in harmony with theconditions which surrounded you, but the wave of civilization which swept over you found you unprepared forthe new conditions and you became weak. . . . [Y]ou mustaccept the new life wholly. You must break down thebarriers and invite the white man with all the elementsof civilization, that your young men may have the sameopportunities under the new conditions that your fathers522US2 Unit: $U20 [01-28-00 16:15:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN353Cite as: 522 U. S. 329 (1998)Opinion of the Courthad under the old." Council of the Yankton Indians(Dec. 17, 1892), transcribed id., at 81.Cole's vivid language and entreaty to "break down the barri-ers" are reminiscent of the "picturesque" statement thatCongress would "pull up the nails" holding down the outsideboundary of the Uintah Reservation, which we viewed asevidence of diminishment in Hagen, 510 U. S., at 417.Moreover, the Commissioners' report of the negotiationssignaled their understanding that the cession of the surpluslands dissolved tribal governance of the 1858 reservation.They observed that "now that [members of the Tribe] havebeen allotted their lands in severalty and have sold their surplus land--the last property bond which assisted to holdthem together in their tribal interest and estate--their tribalinterests may be considered a thing of the past." Report,at 19. And, in a March 1894 letter to the Chairman of theSenate Committee on Indian Affairs, several Yankton chiefsand members of the Tribe indicated that they concurred insuch an interpretation of the agreement's impact. The let-ter urged congressional ratification of the agreement, explaining that the signatories "want[ed] the laws of the UnitedStates and the State that we live in to be recognized andobserved," and that they did not view it as desirable to "keepup the tribal relation . . . as the tribal relation on this reservation is an obstacle and hindrance to the advancement ofcivilization." S. Misc. Doc. No. 134, 53d Cong., 2d Sess., 1(1894).The legislative history itself adds little because Congressconsidered the Siletz, Nez Perce, and Yankton surplus landsale agreements at the same time, but the few relevant references from the floor debates support a finding of diminish-ment. Some members noted that the cessions would restorethe surplus lands to the "public domain," see 53 Cong. Rec.6425 (1894) (remarks of Rep. McCrae); id., at 6426 (remarksof Rep. Hermann), language that indicates congressionalintent to diminish a reservation, see Hagen, supra, at 418;522US2 Unit: $U20 [01-28-00 16:15:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN354 SOUTH DAKOTA v. YANKTON SIOUX TRIBEOpinion of the CourtSolem, 465 U. S., at 475. That same phrase appears in theannual report of the Commissioner on Indian Affairs thatwas released in September 1894, just after congressional rat-ification of the agreement. See Annual Report of the Commissioner on Indian Affairs 26 (Sept. 14, 1894), excerpted inApp. 450-452 (noting that under the Siletz, Nez Perce, andYankton agreements, "some 880,000 acres of land will be re-stored to the public domain").Finally, the Presidential Proclamation opening the lands tosettlement declared that the Tribe had "ceded, sold, relinquished, and conveyed to the United States, all [its] claim,right, title, and interest in and to all the unallotted landswithin the limits of the reservation set apart to said tribe bythe first article [of the 1858 Treaty]." Presidential Proclamation (May 16, 1895), reprinted in App. 453. This Courthas described substantially similar language as "an unambiguous, contemporaneous, statement by the Nation's ChiefExecutive, of a perceived disestablishment." Rosebud, 430U. S., at 602-603. BDespite the apparent contemporaneous understanding thatthe 1894 Act diminished the reservation, in the years since,both Congress and the Executive Branch have described thereservation in contradictory terms and treated the region inan inconsistent manner. An 1896 statute, for example, re-fers to "homestead settlers upon the Yankton Indian Reservation," 29 Stat. 16, while in a Report included in the legisla-tive history for that statute, the Commissioner of IndianAffairs discusses the "former" reservation, H. R. Rep. No.100, 54th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1896). From the 1896 statutoryreference to hearings on the Indian Gaming Regulatory Actnearly a century later, Congress has occasionally, though notinvariably, referred to the "Yankton Sioux Reservation." 55 Hearings on Pub. L. 100-497, The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of1988, before the Subcommittee on Native American Affairs of the HouseCommittee on Natural Resources, 103d Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1994) (held,522US2 Unit: $U20 [01-28-00 16:15:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN355Cite as: 522 U. S. 329 (1998)Opinion of the CourtWe have often observed, however, that "the views of a subsequent Congress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one." United States v. Philadelphia Nat.Bank, 374 U. S. 321, 348-349 (1963). Likewise, the scores ofadministrative documents and maps marshaled by the parties to support or contradict diminishment have limited interpretive value.6 We need not linger over whether themany references to the Yankton Reservation in legislativeaccording to the record, at the Fort Randall Casino Hotel on the "YanktonSioux Reservation"); see, e. g., 143 Cong. Rec. S9616 (Sept. 18, 1997) (discussion of the Marty Indian School "located on the Yankton Sioux Reservation"); 135 Cong. Rec. 1656 (1989) (description of the Lake AndesWagner project, which irrigates "Indian-owned land located on theYankton Sioux Reservation"). But see 35 Stat. 808 (referring to land "onthe former Yankton Reservation").6 See, e. g., Exec. Order No. 5173 (Aug. 9, 1929) (extending the trustperiod on the allotted lands "on the Yankton Sioux Reservation"); Exec.Order No. 2363 (Apr. 30, 1916) (same); Letter to Chairman, Committee onIndian Affairs, from Secretary of the Interior (Feb. 1, 1921), reprinted inApp. 480 (stating that "Lake Andes is within the former Yankton-SiouxIndian Reservation"); Letter to Yankton Agency from the Commissionerof Indian Affairs (Aug. 20, 1930), reprinted in App. 481 (discussing lands"heretofore constituting a part of the reservation"); Bureau of the Census,U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Pub. No. 1990 CPH-1-43, p. 175 (1991), reprintedin App. 527 (listing population figures for the Yankton Reservation).The Tribe also highlights a 1941 opinion letter issued by Felix Cohen,then-acting Solicitor of the Department of the Interior, in which he concluded that the Yankton Reservation had not been altered by the 1894 Actbecause allotments were "scattered over all the reservation," and the Actwas thus distinguishable from statutes that "ceded a definite part of thereservation and treated the remaining areas as a diminished reservation."See Letter of Aug. 7, 1941, reprinted in 1 U. S. Dept. of Interior, Opinionsof the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior Relating to Indian Affairs 1063, 1064 (1979). The letter has not been disavowed but was apparently ignored in subsequent determinations by the agency. A 1969 memorandum on tribal courts, for example, plainly stated that the 1894 Act"diminish[ed] the area over which the [Yankton] tribe might exercise itsauthority." Memorandum M-36783 from Associate Solicitor, Indian Affairs, to Commissioner of Indian Affairs 1 (Sept. 10, 1969), reprinted inApp. 518.522US2 Unit: $U20 [01-28-00 16:15:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN356 SOUTH DAKOTA v. YANKTON SIOUX TRIBEOpinion of the Courtand administrative materials utilized a convenient geograph-ical description or reflected a considered jurisdictional statement. The mixed record we are presented with "reveals noconsistent, or even dominant, approach to the territory inquestion," and it "carries but little force" in light of thestrong textual and contemporaneous evidence of diminishment. Rosebud, supra, at 605, n. 27; see also Solem, 465U. S., at 478 (finding subsequent treatment that was "rifewith contradictions and inconsistencies" to be "of no help toeither side").C"Where non-Indian settlers flooded into the opened portionof a reservation and the area has long since lost its Indiancharacter, we have acknowledged that de facto, if not de jure,diminishment may have occurred." Id., at 471. This finalconsideration is the least compelling for a simple reason:Every surplus land Act necessarily resulted in a surge ofnon-Indian settlement and degraded the "Indian character"of the reservation, yet we have repeatedly stated that notevery surplus land Act diminished the affected reservation.Seeid., at 468-469. The fact that the Yankton populationin the region promptly and drastically declined after the1894 Act does, however, provide "one additional clue as towhat Congress expected,"id., at 472. Today, fewer than 10percent of the 1858 reservation lands are in Indian hands,non-Indians constitute over two-thirds of the populationwithin the 1858 boundaries, and several municipalities insidethose boundaries have been incorporated under South Da-kota law. The opening of the tribal casino in 1991 apparently reversed the population trend; the tribal presence inthe area has steadily increased in recent years, and the advent of gaming has stimulated the local economy. In addi-tion, some acreage within the 1858 boundaries has revertedto tribal or trust land. See H. Hoover, Yankton Sioux TribalLand History (1995), reprinted in App. 545-546. Nonetheless, the area remains "predominantly populated by non522US2 Unit: $U20 [01-28-00 16:15:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN357Cite as: 522 U. S. 329 (1998)Opinion of the CourtIndians with only a few surviving pockets of Indian allot-ments," and those demographics signify a diminishedreservation. Solem, supra, at 471, n. 12.The State's assumption of jurisdiction over the territory,almost immediately after the 1894 Act and continuing virtu-ally unchallenged to the present day, further reinforces ourholding. As the Court of Appeals acknowledged, South Da-kota "has quite consistently exercised various forms of governmental authority over the opened lands," 99 F. 3d, at1455, and the "tribe presented no evidence that it has attempted until recently to exercise civil, regulatory, or crimi-nal jurisdiction over nontrust lands."Id., at 1456. Finally,the Yankton Constitution, drafted in 1932 and amended in1962, defines the Tribe's territory to include only those triballands within the 1858 boundaries "now owned" by the Tribe.Constitution and Bylaws of the Yankton Sioux Tribal Busi-ness and Claims Committee, Art. VI, $ 1.IVThe allotment era has long since ended, and its guidingphilosophy has been repudiated. Tribal communities struggled but endured, preserved their cultural roots, and re-mained, for the most part, near their historic lands. Butdespite the present-day understanding of a "government-to-government relationship between the United States andeach Indian tribe," see, e. g., 25 U. S. C. $ 3601, we must giveeffect to Congress' intent in passing the 1894 Act. Here,as in DeCoteau, we believe that Congress spoke clearly, andalthough "[s]ome might wish [it] had spoken differently, . . .we cannot remake history." 420 U. S., at 449.The 1894 Act contains the most certain statutory language, evincing Congress' intent to diminish the YanktonSioux Reservation by providing for total cession and fixedcompensation. Contemporaneous historical evidence sup-ports that conclusion, and nothing in the ambiguous subsequent treatment of the region substantially controverts our522US2 Unit: $U20 [01-28-00 16:15:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN358 SOUTH DAKOTA v. YANKTON SIOUX TRIBEOpinion of the Courtreasoning. The conflicting understandings about the statusof the reservation, together with the fact that the Tribe continues to own land in common, caution us, however, to limitour holding to the narrow question presented: whether unallotted, ceded lands were severed from the reservation. Weneed not determine whether Congress disestablished thereservation altogether in order to resolve this case, and ac-cordingly decline to do so. Our holding inHagen was simi-larly limited, as was the State Supreme Court's descriptionof the Yankton reservation in Greger. See 510 U. S., at 421;State v. Greger, 559 N. W. 2d, at 867.* * *In sum, we hold that Congress diminished the YanktonSioux Reservation in the 1894 Act, that the unallotted tractsno longer constitute Indian country, and thus that the Statehas primary jurisdiction over the waste site and other landsceded under the Act. Accordingly, we reverse the judgmentof the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and remandthe case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
