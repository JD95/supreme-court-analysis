Today we construe three provisions of the federal fire-arms statutes:"It shall be unlawful for any person who has been convicted . . . [of] a crime punishable by imprisonment fora term exceeding one year . . . [to possess] anyfirearm . . . ." 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g)."What constitutes a conviction . . . shall be determinedin accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in whichthe proceedings were held." $ 921(a)(20) (the choice-oflaw clause)."Any conviction which has been expunged, or set asideor for which a person has been pardoned or has had civilrights restored shall not be considered a conviction . . . ."Ibid. (the exemption clause).The question before us is which jurisdiction's law is to beconsidered in determining whether a felon "has had civilrights restored" for a prior federal conviction.511us2$46J 11-03-97 18:44:51 PAGES OPINPGT370 BEECHAM v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtIEach of the petitioners was convicted of violating $ 922(g).Beecham was convicted in Federal District Court in NorthCarolina, Jones in Federal District Court in West Virginia.Beecham's relevant prior conviction was a 1979 federal conviction in Tennessee, for violating 18 U. S. C. $ 922(h). App.11. Jones' prior convictions were two West Virginia stateconvictions, for breaking and entering and for forgery, andone 1971 federal conviction in Ohio for interstate transportation of a stolen automobile. Id., at 19-20.Jones had gotten his civil rights restored by West Virginia,so his two West Virginia state convictions were not consid-ered. Beecham claimed his civil rights had been restoredby Tennessee, the State in which he had been convicted ofhis federal offense. The question presented to the DistrictCourts was whether these restorations of civil rights byStates could remove the disabilities imposed as a result ofBeecham's and Jones' federal convictions.In both cases, the District Courts concluded the answerwas "yes," though for different reasons: In Beecham's casethe court looked to the law of the State in which the earlierfederal crime was committed (Tennessee); in Jones' case thecourt looked to the law of the State in which Jones livedwhen he committed the $ 922(g) offense (West Virginia).The Fourth Circuit reversed both rulings, reasoning thatstate restoration of civil rights could not undo the federaldisability flowing from a federal conviction. See 993 F. 2d1131 (1993) (Jones' case) and 993 F. 2d 1539 (1993) ( judgt.order in Beecham's case). We granted certiorari to resolvethe conflict this decision created with United States v. Edwards, 946 F. 2d 1347 (CA8 1991), and United States v.Geyler, 932 F. 2d 1330 (CA9 1991). 510 U. S. 975 (1993).IIThe question in these cases is how the choice-of-law clauseand the exemption clause of $ 921(a)(20) are related. If, as511us2$46J 11-03-97 18:44:51 PAGES OPINPGT371Cite as: 511 U. S. 368 (1994)Opinion of the Courtthe Fourth Circuit held, the choice-of-law clause applies tothe exemption clause, then we must look to whether Beecham's and Jones' civil rights were restored under federal law(the law of the jurisdiction in which the earlier proceedingswere held). On the other hand, if, as the Eighth and NinthCircuits concluded, the two clauses ought to be read sepa-rately, seeGeyler, supra, at 1334-1335; Edwards, supra, at1349-1350, then we would have to come up with a specialchoice-of-law principle for the exemption clause.We think the Fourth Circuit's reading is the better one.Throughout the statutory scheme, the inquiry is: Does theperson have a qualifying conviction on his record? Section922(g) imposes a disability on people who "ha[ve] been convicted." The choice-of-law clause defines the rule for determining "[w]hat constitutes a conviction." The exemptionclause says that a conviction for which a person has had civilrights restored "shall not be considered a conviction." Asking whether a person has had civil rights restored is thusjust one step in determining whether something should "beconsidered a conviction." By the terms of the choice-of-lawclause, this determination is governed by the law of the convicting jurisdiction.This interpretation is supported by the fact that the otherthree procedures listed in the exemption clause--pardons,expungements, and set-asides--are either always or almostalways (depending on whether one considers a federal grantof habeas corpus to be a "set-aside," a question we do notnow decide) done by the jurisdiction of conviction. Thatseveral items in a list share an attribute counsels in favor ofinterpreting the other items as possessing that attribute aswell. Dole v. Steelworkers, 494 U. S. 26, 36 (1990); ThirdNat. Bank in Nashville v. Impac Limited, Inc., 432 U. S. 312,322 (1977); Jarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U. S. 303, 307(1961). Though this canon of construction is by no means ahard and fast rule, it is a factor pointing toward the FourthCircuit's construction of the statute.511us2$46J 11-03-97 18:44:51 PAGES OPINPGT372 BEECHAM v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtIn light of the statutory structure, the fact that bothclauses speak of "conviction[s]" rebuts the Eighth and NinthCircuits' argument that the two clauses "pertain to two entirely different sets of circumstances"--"the question ofwhat constitutes a conviction" and "the effect of postconviction events." Geyler, supra, at 1334-1335; see alsoEdwards, supra, at 1349. The exemption clause does notsimply say that a person whose civil rights have been restored is exempted from $ 922(g)'s firearms disqualification.It says that the person's conviction "shall not be considereda conviction." The effect of postconviction events is therefore, under the statutory scheme, just one element of thequestion of what constitutes a conviction.Likewise, the presence of the choice-of-law clause rebutsthe Eighth and Ninth Circuits' argument that the "plain, unlimited language," Edwards, supra, at 1349; see also Geyler,supra, at 1334, of the exemption clause--with its referenceto "[a]ny conviction . . . for which a person has . . . had civilrights restored" (emphasis added)--refers to all civil rightsrestorations, even those by a jurisdiction other than the onein which the conviction was entered. Regardless of whatthe quoted phrase might mean standing alone, in conjunctionwith the choice-of-law clause it must refer only to restorations of civil rights by the convicting jurisdiction. The plainmeaning that we seek to discern is the plain meaning of thewhole statute, not of isolated sentences. See King v. St.Vincent's Hospital, 502 U. S. 215, 221 (1991); Massachusettsv. Morash, 490 U. S. 107, 115 (1989); Shell Oil Co. v. IowaDept. of Revenue, 488 U. S. 19, 26 (1988).We are also unpersuaded by the Ninth Circuit's argumentthat "[b]ecause there is no federal procedure for restoringcivil rights to a federal felon, Congress could not have expected that the federal government would perform this function," and that therefore "[t]he reference in $ 921(a)(20) to therestoration of civil rights must be to the state procedure."511us2$46J 11-03-97 18:44:51 PAGES OPINPGT373Cite as: 511 U. S. 368 (1994)Opinion of the CourtGeyler, 932 F. 2d, at 1333.* This reasoning assumes thatCongress intended felons convicted by all jurisdictions tohave access to all the procedures (pardon, expungement,set-aside, and civil rights restoration) specified in the exemption clause; but nothing in $ 921(a)(20) supports the assumption on which this reasoning is based. Many jurisdictionshave no procedure for restoring civil rights. See Apps. Aand B to Brief for Petitioners (indicating that at least 11States--Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri,New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Vermont, andVirginia suspend felons' civil rights but provide no procedurefor restoring them); see, e. g., Mo. Rev. Stat. $ 561.026 (1979and Supp. 1994); United States v. Thomas, 991 F. 2d 206,213-214 (CA5) (Texas law), cert. denied, 510 U. S. 1014(1993). However one reads the statutory scheme--as looking to the law of the convicting jurisdiction, or to the law ofthe State in which the prior conduct took place, or to the lawof the State in which the felon now lives or has at one timelived--people in some jurisdictions would have options opento them that people in other jurisdictions may lack. Underour reading of the statute, a person convicted in federal courtis no worse off than a person convicted in a court of a Statethat does not restore civil rights.*We express no opinion on whether a federal felon cannot have his civilrights restored under federal law. This is a complicated question, onewhich involves the interpretation of the federal law relating to federalcivil rights, see U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 2, cl. 1 (right to vote for Representatives); U. S. Const., Amdt. XVII (right to vote for Senators); 28 U. S. C.$ 1865 (right to serve on a jury); consideration of the possible relevance of18 U. S. C. $ 925(c) (1988 ed., Supp. IV), which allows the Secretary of theTreasury to grant relief from the disability imposed by $ 922(g); and thedetermination whether civil rights must be restored by an affirmative actof a Government official, see United States v. Ramos, 961 F. 2d 1003, 1008(CA1), cert. denied, 506 U. S. 934 (1992), or whether they may be restoredautomatically by operation of law, see United States v. Hall, 20 F. 3d 1066(CA10 1994). We do not address these matters today.511us2$46J 11-03-97 18:44:51 PAGES OPINPGT374 BEECHAM v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtBecause the statutory language is unambiguous, the ruleof lenity, which petitioners urge us to employ here, is inapplicable. See Chapman v. United States, 500 U. S. 453, 463-464 (1991). Of course, by denying the existence of an ambiguity, we do not claim to be perfectly certain that we havedivined Congress' intentions as to this particular situation.It is possible that the phrases on which our reading of thestatute turns--"[w]hat constitutes a conviction" and "shallnot be considered a conviction"--were accidents of statutorydrafting; it is possible that some legislators thought the twosentences of $ 921(a)(20) should be read separately, or, morelikely, that they never considered the matter at all. And werecognize that in enacting the choice-of-law clause, legisla-tors may have been simply responding to our decision inDickerson v. New Banner Institute, Inc., 460 U. S. 103(1983), which held that federal law rather than state lawcontrols the definition of what constitutes a conviction, notsetting forth a choice-of-law principle for the restoration ofcivil rights following a conviction.But our task is not the hopeless one of ascertaining whatthe legislators who passed the law would have decided hadthey reconvened to consider petitioners' particular cases.Rather, it is to determine whether the language the legisla-tors actually enacted has a plain, unambiguous meaning. Inthis instance, we believe it does.IIIWe therefore conclude that petitioners can take advantageof $ 921(a)(20) only if they have had their civil rights restoredunder federal law, and accordingly affirm the judgment ofthe Court of Appeals.
