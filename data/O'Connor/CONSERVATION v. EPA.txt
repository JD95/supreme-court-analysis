Petitionercontends that in rejecting this argument, the Court of Ap-peals for the Eighth Circuit improperly held that the SixthAmendment right to counsel was "not applicable" because"the officers did not interrogate [petitioner] at his home."285 F. 3d 721, 724 (2002). We granted the petition for a writof certiorari, 538 U. S. 905 (2003), and now reverse.IOn February 24, 2000, after a grand jury indicted peti-tioner for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, Lincoln Police Sergeant Michael Garnett and Lancaster CountyDeputy Sheriff Jeff Bliemeister went to petitioner's homein Lincoln, Nebraska, to arrest him. App. 111. The officersknocked on petitioner's door and, when petitioner answered,identified themselves and asked if they could come in. Ibid.Petitioner invited the officers into his living room.Ibid.The officers advised petitioner they had come to discusshis involvement in methamphetamine distribution. Id., at112. They informed petitioner that they had a federal warrant for his arrest and that a grand jury had indicted himfor conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine.Ibid. Theofficers told petitioner that the indictment referred to hisinvolvement with certain individuals, four of whom theynamed. Ibid. Petitioner then told the officers that heknew the four people and had used methamphetamine duringhis association with them. Ibid.After spending about 15 minutes in petitioner's home, theofficers transported petitioner to the Lancaster County jail.Ibid. There, the officers advised petitioner for the first timeof his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966),and Patterson v. Illinois, 487 U. S. 285 (1988). App. 112.Petitioner and the two officers signed aMiranda waiver540US2 Unit: $U16 [11-01-05 13:36:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN522 FELLERS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtform, and petitioner then reiterated the inculpatory state-ments he had made earlier, admitted to having associatedwith other individuals implicated in the charged conspiracy,App. 29-39, and admitted to having loaned money to one ofthem even though he suspected that she was involved indrug transactions,id., at 34.Before trial, petitioner moved to suppress the inculpatorystatements he made at his home and at the county jail. AMagistrate Judge conducted a hearing and recommendedthat the statements petitioner made at his home be sup-pressed because the officers had not informed petitioner ofhis Miranda rights. App. 110-111. The Magistrate Judgefound that petitioner made the statements in response to theofficers' "implici[t] questions," noting that the officers hadtold petitioner that the purpose of their visit was to discuss his use and distribution of methamphetamine. Id., at110. The Magistrate Judge further recommended that portions of petitioner's jailhouse statement be suppressed asfruits of the prior failure to provide Miranda warnings.App. 110-111.The District Court suppressed the "unwarned" statementspetitioner made at his house but admitted petitioner's jailhouse statements pursuant to Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298(1985), concluding petitioner had knowingly and voluntarilywaived his Miranda rights before making the statements.App. 112-115.Following a jury trial at which petitioner's jailhouse statements were admitted into evidence, petitioner was convictedof conspiring to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine. Petitioner appealed, arguing that his jailhousestatements should have been suppressed as fruits of thestatements obtained at his home in violation of the SixthAmendment. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 285 F. 3d721 (CA8 2002). With respect to petitioner's argument thatthe officers' failure to administer Miranda warnings at hishome violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel under540US2 Unit: $U16 [11-01-05 13:36:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN523Cite as: 540 U. S. 519 (2004)Opinion of the CourtPatterson, supra, the Court of Appeals stated: "Patterson isnot applicable here . . . for the officers did not interrogate[petitioner] at his home." 285 F. 3d, at 724. The Court ofAppeals also concluded that the statements from the jailwere properly admitted under the rule of Elstad, supra.285 F. 3d, at 724 (" `Though Miranda requires that theunwarned admission must be suppressed, the admissibilityof any subsequent statement should turn in these circumstances solely on whether it is knowingly and voluntarilymade' " (quotingElstad, supra, at 309)).Judge Riley filed a concurring opinion. He concluded thatduring their conversation at petitioner's home, officers "de-liberately elicited incriminating information" from petitioner.285 F. 3d, at 726-727. That "post-indictment conduct out-side the presence of counsel," Judge Riley reasoned, violatedpetitioner's Sixth Amendment rights. Id., at 727. JudgeRiley nevertheless concurred in the judgment, concludingthat the jailhouse statements were admissible under the ra-tionale ofElstad in light of petitioner's knowing and volun-tary waiver of his right to counsel. 285 F. 3d, at 727.IIThe Sixth Amendment right to counsel is triggered "at orafter the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated. . . `whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing,indictment, information, or arraignment.' " Brewer v. Williams, 430 U. S. 387, 398 (1977) (quoting Kirby v. Illinois, 406U. S. 682, 689 (1972)). We have held that an accused is denied "the basic protections" of the Sixth Amendment "whenthere [is] used against him at his trial evidence of his ownincriminating words, which federal agents . . . deliberatelyelicited from him after he had been indicted and in the absence of his counsel." Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S.201, 206 (1964); cf. Patterson, supra (holding that the SixthAmendment does not bar postindictment questioning in theabsence of counsel if a defendant waives the right to counsel).540US2 Unit: $U16 [11-01-05 13:36:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN524 FELLERS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtWe have consistently applied the deliberate-elicitationstandard in subsequent Sixth Amendment cases, see UnitedStates v. Henry, 447 U. S. 264, 270 (1980) ("The question hereis whether under the facts of this case a Government agent`deliberately elicited' incriminating statements . . . within themeaning of Massiah"); Brewer, supra, at 399 (finding a SixthAmendment violation where a detective "deliberately anddesignedly set out to elicit information from [the suspect]"),and we have expressly distinguished this standard fromthe Fifth Amendment custodial-interrogation standard, seeMichigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625, 632, n. 5 (1986) ("[T]heSixth Amendment provides a right to counsel . . . even whenthere is no interrogation and no Fifth Amendment applicability"); Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U. S. 291, 300, n. 4 (1980)("The definitions of `interrogation' under the Fifth and SixthAmendments, if indeed the term `interrogation' is even aptin the Sixth Amendment context, are not necessarily interchangeable"); cf. United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218 (1967)(holding that the Sixth Amendment provides the right tocounsel at a postindictment lineup even though the FifthAmendment is not implicated).The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the absenceof an "interrogation" foreclosed petitioner's claim that thejailhouse statements should have been suppressed as fruitsof the statements taken from petitioner at his home. First,there is no question that the officers in this case "deliberatelyelicited" information from petitioner. Indeed, the officers,upon arriving at petitioner's house, informed him that theirpurpose in coming was to discuss his involvement in the distribution of methamphetamine and his association with certain charged co-conspirators. 285 F. 3d, at 723; App. 112.Because the ensuing discussion took place after petitionerhad been indicted, outside the presence of counsel, and in theabsence of any waiver of petitioner's Sixth Amendmentrights, the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the offi540US2 Unit: $U16 [11-01-05 13:36:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN525Cite as: 540 U. S. 519 (2004)Opinion of the Courtcers' actions did not violate the Sixth Amendment standardsestablished in Massiah, supra, and its progeny.Second, because of its erroneous determination that peti-tioner was not questioned in violation of Sixth Amendmentstandards, the Court of Appeals improperly conducted its"fruits" analysis under the Fifth Amendment. Specifically,it applied Elstad to hold that the admissibility of the jail-house statements turns solely on whether the statementswere " `knowingly and voluntarily made.' " 285 F. 3d, at 724(quotingElstad, 470 U. S., at 309). The Court of Appealsdid not reach the question whether the Sixth Amendmentrequires suppression of petitioner's jailhouse statements onthe ground that they were the fruits of previous questioningconducted in violation of the Sixth Amendment deliberate-elicitation standard. We have not had occasion to decidewhether the rationale of Elstad applies when a suspectmakes incriminating statements after a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to counsel notwithstanding earlierpolice questioning in violation of Sixth Amendment standards. We therefore remand to the Court of Appeals to ad-dress this issue in the first instance.Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is re-versed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.
