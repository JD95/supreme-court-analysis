Out of respect for finality, comity, and the orderly adminis-tration of justice, a federal court will not entertain a procedurally defaulted constitutional claim in a petition for habeascorpus absent a showing of cause and prejudice to excusethe default. We have recognized a narrow exception to thegeneral rule when the habeas applicant can demonstrate thatthe alleged constitutional error has resulted in the convictionof one who is actually innocent of the underlying offense or,in the capital sentencing context, of the aggravating circum-stances rendering the inmate eligible for the death penalty.Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478 (1986); Sawyer v. Whitley,505 U. S. 333 (1992). The question before us is whether thisexception applies where an applicant asserts "actual innocence" of a noncapital sentence.

IIn 1997, respondent Michael Wayne Haley was arrestedafter stealing a calculator from a local Wal-Mart and attempting to exchange it for other merchandise. Respondentwas charged with, and found guilty at trial of, theft of property valued at less than $1,500, which, because respondentalready had two prior theft convictions, was a "state jail felony" punishable by a maximum of two years in prison. App.8; Tex. Penal Code Ann. $ 31.03(e)(4)(D) (Supp. 2004). TheState also charged respondent as a habitual felony offender.The indictment alleged that respondent had two prior felonyconvictions and that the first--a 1991 conviction for deliveryof amphetamine--"became final prior to the commission" ofthe second--a 1992 robbery. App. 9. The timing of thefirst conviction and the second offense is significant: UnderTexas' habitual offender statute, only a defendant convictedof a felony who "has previously been finally convicted of twofelonies, and the second previous felony conviction is for anoffense that occurred subsequent to the first previous conviction having become final, . . . shall be punished for a second-degree felony." $ 12.42(a)(2) (emphasis added). A seconddegree felony carries a minimum sentence of 2 and a maxi-mum sentence of 20 years in prison. $ 12.33(a) (2003).Texas provides for bifurcated trials in habitual offendercases. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.07, $ 3 (VernonSupp. 2004). If a defendant is found guilty of the substan-tive offense, the State, at a separate penalty hearing, mustprove the habitual offender allegations beyond a reasonabledoubt. Ibid. During the penalty phase of respondent'strial, the State introduced records showing that respondenthad been convicted of delivery of amphetamine on October18, 1991, and attempted robbery on September 9, 1992. Therecord of the second conviction, however, showed that re541US2 Unit: $U42 [01-27-05 17:13:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN390 DRETKE v. HALEYOpinion of the Courtspondent had committed the robbery on October 15, 1991--three daysbefore his first conviction became final. Neitherthe prosecutor, nor the defense attorney, nor the witness ten-dered by the State to authenticate the records, nor the trialjudge, nor the jury, noticed the 3-day discrepancy. Indeed,the defense attorney chose not to cross-examine the State'switness or to put on any evidence.The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the habitual of-fender charge and recommended a sentence of 161/2 years; thecourt followed the recommendation. Respondent appealed.Appellate counsel did not mention the 3-day discrepancynor challenge the sufficiency of the penalty-phase evidenceto support the habitual offender enhancement. The StateCourt of Appeals affirmed respondent's conviction and sentence; the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals refused respondent's petition for discretionary review.Respondent thereafter sought state postconviction relief,arguing for the first time that he was ineligible for the habitual offender enhancement based on the timing of his secondconviction. App. 83, 87-88. The state habeas court refusedto consider the merits of that claim because respondent hadnot raised it, as required by state procedural law, either attrial or on direct appeal. Id., at 107, 108. The state habeascourt rejected respondent's related ineffective assistance ofcounsel claim, saying only that "counsel was not ineffective"for failing to object to or to appeal the enhancement. Id.,at 108. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals summarilydenied respondent's state habeas application. Id., at 109.In August 2000, respondent filed a timely pro se application for a federal writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28U. S. C. $ 2254, renewing his sufficiency of the evidence andineffective assistance of counsel claims. App. 110, 118-119;id., at 122, 124, 126-127. The State conceded that respondent was "correct in his assertion that the enhancement paragraphs as alleged in the indictment do not satisfy section12.42(a)(2) of the Texas Penal Code." Id., at 132, 140.541US2 Unit: $U42 [01-27-05 17:13:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN391Cite as: 541 U. S. 386 (2004)Opinion of the CourtRather than agree to resentencing, however, the State ar-gued that respondent had procedurally defaulted the sufficiency of the evidence claim by failing to raise it before thestate trial court or on direct appeal.Id., at 142-144. TheMagistrate Judge, to whom the habeas application had beenreferred, recommended excusing the procedural default andgranting the sufficiency of the evidence claim because respondent was " `actually innocent' of a sentence for a second-degree felony."Haley v. Director, Texas Dept. of CriminalJustice, Institutions Div., Civ. No. 6:00cv518 (ED Tex., Sept.13, 2001), p. 10, App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a (citingSones v.Hargett, 61 F. 3d 410, 419 (CA5 1995)). Because she recommended relief on the erroneous enhancement claim, the Magistrate Judge did not address respondent's related ineffectiveassistance of counsel challenges. App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a-52a. The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge's report, granted the application, and ordered the State to resentence respondent "without the improper enhancement."Id., at 36a-37a (Oct. 27, 2001).The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding narrowly that the actual innocence exception "applies tononcapital sentencing procedures involving a career or habitual felony offender." Haley v. Cockrell, 306 F. 3d 257, 264(2002). The Fifth Circuit thus joined the Fourth Circuit inholding that the exception should not extend beyond allegedly erroneous recidivist enhancements to other claims ofnoncapital factual sentencing error: "[T]o broaden the exception further would `swallow' the `cause portion of the causeand prejudice requirement' and it `would conflict squarelywith Supreme Court authority indicating that generallymore than prejudice must exist to excuse a procedural default.' " Id., at 266 (quoting United States v. Mikalajunas,186 F. 3d 490, 494-495 (CA4 1999)). Finding the exceptionsatisfied, the panel then granted relief on the merits of respondent's otherwise defaulted sufficiency of the evidenceclaim. In so doing, the panel assumed that challenges to the541US2 Unit: $U42 [01-27-05 17:13:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN392 DRETKE v. HALEYOpinion of the Courtsufficiency of noncapital sentencing evidence are cognizableon federal habeas under Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307(1979). 306 F. 3d, at 266-267 (citing French v. Estelle, 692F. 2d 1021, 1024-1025 (CA5 1982)).The Fifth Circuit's decision exacerbated a growing diver-gence of opinion in the Courts of Appeals regarding theavailability and scope of the actual innocence exception inthe noncapital sentencing context. CompareEmbrey v.Hershberger, 131 F. 3d 739 (CA8 1997) (en banc) (no actualinnocence exception for noncapital sentencing error); Reid v.Oklahoma, 101 F. 3d 628 (CA10 1996) (same), with Spence v.Superintendent, Great Meadow Correctional Facility, 219F. 3d 162 (CA2 2000) (actual innocence exception applies innoncapital sentencing context when error is related to find-ing of predicate act forming the basis for enhancement), andMikalajunas, supra (actual innocence exception applies innoncapital sentencing context where error relates to a recidivist enhancement). We granted the State's request for awrit of certiorari, 540 U. S. 945 (2003), and now vacate andremand. IIThe procedural default doctrine, like the abuse of writ doc-trine, "refers to a complex and evolving body of equitableprinciples informed and controlled by historical usage, statu-tory developments, and judicial decisions."McCleskey v.Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 489 (1991). A corollary to the habeasstatute's exhaustion requirement, the doctrine has its rootsin the general principle that federal courts will not disturbstate court judgments based on adequate and independentstate law procedural grounds. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433U. S. 72, 81 (1977); Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 486-487(1953). But, while an adequate and independent state procedural disposition strips this Court of certiorari jurisdictionto review a state court's judgment, it provides only a strongprudential reason, grounded in "considerations of comity andconcerns for the orderly administration of criminal justice,"541US2 Unit: $U42 [01-27-05 17:13:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN393Cite as: 541 U. S. 386 (2004)Opinion of the Courtnot to pass upon a defaulted constitutional claim presentedfor federal habeas review.Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S.536, 538-539 (1976); see also Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 399(1963) ("[T]he doctrine under which state procedural defaultsare held to constitute an adequate and independent state lawground barring direct Supreme Court review is not to beextended to limit the power granted the federal courts underthe federal habeas statute"). That being the case, we haverecognized an equitable exception to the bar when a habeasapplicant can demonstrate cause and prejudice for the proce-dural default.Wainwright, supra, at 87. The cause andprejudice requirement shows due regard for States' finalityand comity interests while ensuring that "fundamental fairness [remains] the central concern of the writ of habeas corpus." Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 697 (1984).The cause and prejudice standard is not a perfect safeguard against fundamental miscarriages of justice. Murrayv. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478 (1986), thus recognized a narrowexception to the cause requirement where a constitutionalviolation has "probably resulted" in the conviction of onewho is "actually innocent" of the substantive offense. Id.,at 496; accord, Schlup v. Delo, 513 U. S. 298 (1995). We subsequently extended this exception to claims of capital sentencing error in Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333 (1992).Acknowledging that the concept of " `actual innocence' " didnot translate neatly into the capital sentencing context, welimited the exception to cases in which the applicant couldshow "by clear and convincing evidence that, but for a constitutional error, no reasonable juror would have found the petitioner eligible for the death penalty under the applicablestate law." Id., at 336.We are asked in the present case to extend the actual innocence exception to procedural default of constitutional claimschallenging noncapital sentencing error. We decline to answer the question in the posture of this case and instead holdthat a federal court faced with allegations of actual inno541US2 Unit: $U42 [01-27-05 17:13:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN394 DRETKE v. HALEYOpinion of the Courtcence, whether of the sentence or of the crime charged, mustfirst address all nondefaulted claims for comparable reliefand other grounds for cause to excuse the procedural default.This avoidance principle was implicit inCarrier itself,where we expressed confidence that, "for the most part,`victims of a fundamental miscarriage of justice will meetthe cause-and-prejudice standard.' " 477 U. S., at 495-496(quoting Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 135 (1982)). Our con-fidence was bolstered by the availability of ineffective assistance of counsel claims--either as a ground for cause or as afreestanding claim for relief--to safeguard against miscarriages of justice. The existence of such safeguards, we observed, "may properly inform this Court's judgment in determining `[w]hat standards should govern the exercise ofthe habeas court's equitable discretion' with respect to procedurally defaulted claims." Carrier, supra, at 496 (quotingReed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1, 9 (1984)).Petitioner here conceded at oral argument that respondenthas a viable and "significant" ineffective assistance of counselclaim. Tr. of Oral Arg. 18 ("[W]e agree at this point thereis a very significant argument of ineffective assistance ofcounsel"); see also id., at 7 (agreeing "not [to] raise any procedural impediment" to consideration of the merits of respondent's ineffective assistance claim on remand). Success onthe merits would give respondent all of the relief that heseeks--i. e., resentencing. It would also provide cause toexcuse the procedural default of his sufficiency of the evidence claim. Carrier, supra, at 488.Contrary to the dissent's view, see post, at 397 (opinion ofStevens, J.), it is precisely because the various exceptionsto the procedural default doctrine are judge-made rules thatcourts as their stewards must exercise restraint, adding toor expanding them only when necessary. To hold otherwisewould be to license district courts to riddle the cause andprejudice standard with ad hoc exceptions whenever theyperceive an error to be "clear" or departure from the rules541US2 Unit: $U42 [01-27-05 17:13:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN395Cite as: 541 U. S. 386 (2004)Opinion of the Courtexpedient. Such an approach, not the rule of restraintadopted here, would have the unhappy effect of prolongingthe pendency of federal habeas applications as each new ex-ception is tested in the courts of appeals. And because petitioner has assured us that the State will not seek to reincar-cerate respondent during the pendency of his ineffectiveassistance claim, Tr. of Oral Arg. 52 ("[T]he state is willingto allow the ineffective assistance case to be litigated beforeproceeding to reincarcerate [respondent]"), the negative consequences for respondent of our judgment to vacate and re-mand in this case are minimal.While availability of other remedies alone would be sufficient justification for a general rule of avoidance, the manythreshold legal questions often accompanying claims of actual innocence provide additional reason for restraint. Forinstance, citing Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979),respondent here seeks to bring through the actual innocencegateway his constitutional claim that the State's penaltyphase evidence was insufficient to support the recidivist enhancement. But the constitutional hook in Jackson wasIn re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970), in which we held thatdue process requires proof of each element of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt. We have not extendedWinship's protections to proof of prior convictions used tosupport recidivist enhancements. Almendarez-Torres v.United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998); see also Apprendi v.New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 488-490 (2000) (reserving judgment as to the validity of Almendarez-Torres); Monge v. California, 524 U. S. 721, 734 (1998) (Double Jeopardy Clausedoes not preclude retrial on a prior conviction used to support recidivist enhancement). Respondent contends thatAlmendarez-Torres should be overruled or, in the alternative, that it does not apply because the recidivist statute atissue required the jury to find not only the existence of hisprior convictions but also the additional fact that they weresequential. Brief for Respondent 30-31. These difficult541US2 Unit: $U42 [01-27-05 17:13:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN396 DRETKE v. HALEYStevens, J., dissentingconstitutional questions, simply assumed away by the dis-sent, see post, at 397 (citing Jackson, supra, and Thompsonv. Louisville, 362 U. S. 199 (1960)), are to be avoided ifpossible.To be sure, not all claims of actual innocence will involvethreshold constitutional issues. Even so, as this case andthe briefing illustrate, such claims are likely to presentequally difficult questions regarding the scope of the actualinnocence exception itself. Whether and to what extent theexception extends to noncapital sentencing error is just oneexample. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistentwith this opinion.
