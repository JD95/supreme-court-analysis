In 1981 Thomas Eugene Creech beat and kicked to deatha fellow inmate at the Idaho State Penitentiary. He pleadedguilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced to death.The sentence was based in part on the statutory aggravatingcircumstance that "[b]y the murder, or circumstancessurrounding its commission, the defendant exhibited utterdisregard for human life." Idaho Code $ 19-2515(g)(6) (1987).The sole question we must decide is whether the "utter disregard" circumstance, as interpreted by the Idaho SupremeCourt, adequately channels sentencing discretion as requiredby the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.IThe facts underlying this case could not be more chilling.Thomas Creech has admitted to killing or participating inthe killing of at least 26 people. The bodies of 11 of hisvictims--who were shot, stabbed, beaten, or strangled todeath--have been recovered in seven States. Creech has507us2$49J 11-26-96 16:58:54 PAGES OPINPGT466 ARAVE v. CREECHOpinion of the Courtsaid repeatedly that, unless he is completely isolated fromhumanity, he likely will continue killing. And he has identified by name three people outside prison walls he intends tokill if given the opportunity.Creech's most recent victim was David Dale Jensen, a fel-low inmate in the maximum security unit of the Idaho StatePenitentiary. When he killed Jensen, Creech was alreadyserving life sentences for other first-degree murders. Jensen, about seven years Creech's junior, was a nonviolent carthief. He was also physically handicapped. Part of Jensen's brain had been removed prior to his incarceration, andhe had a plastic plate in his skull.The circumstances surrounding Jensen's death remain un-clear, primarily because Creech has given conflicting accounts of them. In one version, Creech killed Jensen in self-defense. In another--the version that Creech gave at hissentencing hearing--other inmates offered to pay Creech orhelp him escape if he killed Jensen. Creech, through an intermediary, provided Jensen with makeshift weapons andthen arranged for Jensen to attack him, in order to create anexcuse for the killing. Whichever of these accounts (ifeither) is true, the Idaho Supreme Court found that the record supported the following facts:"Jensen approached Creech and swung a weapon at himwhich consisted of a sock containing batteries. Creechtook the weapon away from Jensen, who returned to hiscell but emerged with a toothbrush to which had beentaped a razor blade. When the two men again met, Jen-sen made some movement toward Creech, who thenstruck Jensen between the eyes with the battery ladensock, knocking Jensen to the floor. The fight continued,according to Creech's version, with Jensen swinging therazor blade at Creech and Creech hitting Jensen withthe battery filled sock. The plate imbedded in Jensen'sskull shattered, and blood from Jensen's skull wassplashed on the floor and walls. Finally, the sock broke507us2$49J 11-26-96 16:58:54 PAGES OPINPGT467Cite as: 507 U. S. 463 (1993)Opinion of the Courtand the batteries fell out, and by that time Jensen washelpless. Creech then commenced kicking Jensen aboutthe throat and head. Sometime later a guard noticedblood, and Jensen was taken to the hospital, where hedied the same day." State v. Creech, 105 Idaho 362, 364,670 P. 2d 463, 465 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U. S. 1051(1984).Creech pleaded guilty to first-degree murder. The trialjudge held a sentencing hearing in accordance with IdahoCode $ 19-2515(d) (1987). After the hearing, the judge is-sued written findings in the format prescribed by Rule 33.1of the Idaho Criminal Rules. Under the heading "Facts andArgument Found in Mitigation," he listed that Creech "didnot instigate the fight with the victim, but the victim, with-out provocation, attacked him. [Creech] was initially justified in protecting himself." App. 32. Under the heading"Facts and Argumen[t] Found in Aggravation," the judgestated:"[T]he victim, once the attack commenced, was underthe complete domination and control of the defendant.The murder itself was extremely gruesome evidencingan excessive violent rage. With the victim's attack asan excuse, the . . . murder then took on many of theaspects of an assassination. These violent actions . . .went well beyond self-defense.. . . . .". . . The murder, once commenced, appears to havebeen an intentional, calculated act."Id., at 32-33.The judge then found beyond a reasonable doubt five statu-tory aggravating circumstances, including that Creech, "[b]ythe murder, or circumstances surrounding its commission, . . .exhibited utter disregard for human life."Id., at 34. Heobserved in this context that "[a]fter the victim was helpless[Creech] killed him." Ibid. Next, the judge concluded thatthe mitigating circumstances did not outweigh the aggravat507us2$49J 11-26-96 16:58:54 PAGES OPINPGT468 ARAVE v. CREECHOpinion of the Courting circumstances. Reiterating that Creech "intentionallydestroyed another human being at a time when he was completely helpless," ibid., the judge sentenced Creech to death.After temporarily remanding for the trial judge to imposesentence in open court in Creech's presence, the Idaho Su-preme Court affirmed. The court rejected Creech's argument that the "utter disregard" circumstance is unconstitu-tionally vague, reaffirming the limiting construction it hadplaced on the statutory language in State v. Osborn, 102Idaho 405, 631 P. 2d 187 (1981):" `A . . . limiting construction must be placed upon theaggravating circumstances in I. C. $ 19-2515[g](6), that"[b]y the murder, or the circumstances surrounding itscommission, the defendant exhibited utter disregard forhuman life." To properly define this circumstance, it isimportant to note the other aggravating circumstanceswith which this provision overlaps. The second aggra-vating circumstance, I. C. $ 19-2515[g](2), that the defendant committed another murder at the time thismurder was committed, obviously could show an utterdisregard for human life, as could the third aggravatingcircumstance, I. C. $ 19-2515[g](3), that the defendantknowingly created a great risk of death to many per-sons. The same can be said for the fourth aggravatingcircumstance, I. C. $ 19-2515[g](4), that the murder wascommitted for remuneration. Since we will not presume that the legislative intent was to duplicate any al-ready enumerated circumstance, thus making [the "utterdisregard" circumstance] mere surplusage, we hold thatthe phrase "utter disregard" must be viewed in reference to acts other than those set forth in I. C. $$ 19-2515[g](2), (3), and (4). We conclude instead that thephrase is meant to be reflective of acts or circumstancessurrounding the crime which exhibit the highest, theutmost, callous disregard for human life, i. e., thecold-blooded, pitiless slayer.' " Creech, supra, at 370,507us2$49J 11-26-96 16:58:54 PAGES OPINPGT469Cite as: 507 U. S. 463 (1993)Opinion of the Court670 P. 2d, at 471 (quoting Osborn, supra, at 418-419,631 P. 2d, at 200-201) (citation omitted).After independently reviewing the record, the Idaho Su-preme Court also held that the evidence clearly supportedthe trial judge's findings of aggravating and mitigating cir-cumstances, including the finding that Creech had exhibited"utter disregard for human life." 105 Idaho, at 369, 670P. 2d, at 470. Then, as required by Idaho law, see IdahoCode $ 19-2827(c)(3) (1987), the court compared Creech's caseto similar cases in order to determine whether his sentencewas excessive or disproportionate. The court emphaticallyconcluded that it was not: "We have examined cases datingback more than 50 years and our examination fails to disclosethat any such remorseless, calculating, cold-blooded multiplemurderer has . . . ever been before this Court." 105 Idaho,at 375, 670 P. 2d, at 476 (footnote omitted).Creech filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus inthe United States District Court for the District of Idaho.The District Court denied relief. See Creech v. Arave,No. 86-1042 (June 18, 1986). The Court of Appeals for theNinth Circuit, however, agreed with Creech that the "utterdisregard" circumstance is unconstitutionally vague. 947F. 2d 873 (1991). The court first considered the statutorylanguage itself and concluded that the phrase "utter disregard" does not adequately channel sentencing discretion.Id., at 882-883. The court then considered the Osbornnarrowing construction and found it unsatisfactory as well.Explaining what "utter disregard" does not mean, the Courtof Appeals reasoned, does not give the phrase content. 947F. 2d, at 883, n. 12. Nor do the words " `the highest, theutmost, callous disregard for human life' " clarify the statutory language; they merely emphasize it. Id., at 883-884(citingMaynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356, 364 (1988)).The phrase "cold-blooded, pitiless slayer" also was deemedinadequate. The Court of Appeals construed our prece-dents, including Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990), to507us2$49J 11-26-96 16:58:54 PAGES OPINPGT470 ARAVE v. CREECHOpinion of the Courtrequire that a limiting construction "defin[e] the terms of thestatutory aggravating circumstance through objective standards." 947 F. 2d, at 884. "[C]old-blooded, pitiless slayer"fails, the court said, because it calls for a "subjective determination." Ibid. The court found further evidence of theOsborn construction's infirmity in its application to this case.In the Court of Appeals' view, the trial judge's findings thatJensen attacked Creech "without provocation" and that themurder " `evidenc[ed] an excessive violent rage' " could notbe reconciled with the conclusion that Creech was a "cold-blooded, pitiless" killer. 947 F. 2d, at 884. The Court ofAppeals therefore found the "utter disregard" circumstancefacially invalid.Id., at 884-885.Three judges dissented from an order denying rehearingen banc. The dissenters argued that the panel had miscon-strued both the "utter disregard" factor and this Court'sprior decisions. Whether a defendant is a "cold-blooded,pitiless slayer," they said, is not a subjective inquiry; it is anevidentiary question to be determined from facts and circum-stances.Id., at 890 (opinion of Trott, J.). The dissentersfound the Osborn limiting construction indistinguishablefrom the construction this Court approved in Walton. 947F. 2d, at 890. We granted certiorari, limited to the narrowquestion whether the "utter disregard" circumstance, as in-terpreted by the Idaho Supreme Court in Osborn, is unconstitutionally vague. See 504 U. S. 984 (1992).IIThis case is governed by the standards we articulated inWalton, supra, and Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U. S. 764 (1990). InJeffers we reaffirmed the fundamental principle that, to sat-isfy the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, a capital sentencing scheme must " `suitably direc[t] and limi[t]' " the sen-tencer's discretion " `so as to minimize the risk of whollyarbitrary and capricious action.' " Id., at 774 (quoting Greggv. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 189 (1976) ( joint opinion of Stewart,507us2$49J 11-26-96 16:58:55 PAGES OPINPGT471Cite as: 507 U. S. 463 (1993)Opinion of the CourtPowell, and Stevens, JJ.)). The State must " `channel thesentencer's discretion by clear and objective standards thatprovide specific and detailed guidance, and that make ration-ally reviewable the process for imposing a sentence ofdeath.' " 497 U. S., at 774 (quoting Godfrey v. Georgia, 446U. S. 420, 428 (1980) (plurality opinion) (internal quotationmarks omitted)).In Walton we set forth the inquiry that a federal courtmust undertake when asked to decide whether a particularaggravating circumstance meets these standards:"[The] federal court . . . must first determine whetherthe statutory language defining the circumstance is itselftoo vague to provide any guidance to the sentencer. Ifso, then the federal court must attempt to determinewhether the state courts have further defined the vagueterms and, if they have done so, whether those defini-tions are constitutionally sufficient,i. e., whether theyprovide some guidance to the sentencer." 497 U. S., at654 (emphasis in original).Where, as in Idaho, the sentencer is a judge rather than ajury, the federal court must presume that the judge knewand applied any existing narrowing construction. Id., at653.Unlike the Court of Appeals, we do not believe it is necessary to decide whether the statutory phrase "utter disregardfor human life" itself passes constitutional muster. TheIdaho Supreme Court has adopted a limiting construction,and we believe that construction meets constitutionalrequirements.Contrary to the dissent's assertions, see post, at 481-485,the phrase "cold-blooded, pitiless slayer" is not withoutcontent. Webster's Dictionary defines "pitiless" to meandevoid of, or unmoved by, mercy or compassion. Webster'sThird New International Dictionary 1726 (1986). The leadentry for "cold-blooded" gives coordinate definitions. One,507us2$49J 11-26-96 16:58:55 PAGES OPINPGT472 ARAVE v. CREECHOpinion of the Court"marked by absence of warm feelings: without consideration,compunction, or clemency,"id., at 442, mirrors the definitionof "pitiless." The other defines "cold-blooded" to mean"matter of fact, emotionless."Ibid. It is true that "coldblooded" is sometimes also used to describe "premedita[tion]," Black's Law Dictionary 260 (6th ed. 1990)--amental state that may coincide with, but is distinct from, alack of feeling or compassion. But premeditation is clearlynot the sense in which the Idaho Supreme Court used theword "cold-blooded" in Osborn. Other terms in the limit-ing construction--"callous" and "pitiless"--indicate thatthe court used the word "cold-blooded" in its first sense."Premedita[tion]," moreover, is specifically addressed elsewhere in the Idaho homicide statutes, Idaho Code $ 18-4003(a) (1987) (amended version at Supp. 1992); had theOsborn court meant premeditation, it likely would have usedthe statutory language.In ordinary usage, then, the phrase "cold-blooded, pitilessslayer" refers to a killer who kills without feeling or sympathy. We assume that legislators use words in their ordinary,everyday senses, see, e. g., INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U. S. 183,189 (1984), and there is no reason to suppose that judges dootherwise. The dissent questions our resort to dictionariesfor the common meaning of the word "cold-blooded," post, at482, but offers no persuasive authority to suggest that theword, in its present context, means anything else.The Court of Appeals thought the Osborn limiting construction inadequate not because the phrase "cold-blooded,pitiless slayer" lacks meaning, but because it requires thesentencer to make a "subjective determination." We disagree. We are not faced with pejorative adjectives such as"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel" or "outrageously orwantonly vile, horrible and inhuman"--terms that describe acrime as a whole and that this Court has held to be unconstitutionally vague. See, e. g., Shell v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 1(1990) (per curiam); Cartwright, 486 U. S., at 363-364; God507us2$49J 11-26-96 16:58:55 PAGES OPINPGT473Cite as: 507 U. S. 463 (1993)Opinion of the Courtfrey, supra, at 428-429. The terms "cold-blooded" and "piti-less" describe the defendant's state of mind: not hismensrea, but his attitude toward his conduct and his victim. Thelaw has long recognized that a defendant's state of mind isnot a "subjective" matter, but a fact to be inferred from thesurrounding circumstances. See United States Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U. S. 711, 716-717 (1983)(" `The state of a man's mind is as much a fact as the state ofhis digestion. It is true that it is very difficult to prove . . . ,but if it can be ascertained it is as much a fact as anythingelse' " (quotingEdgington v. Fitzmaurice, 29 Ch. Div. 459,483 (1885))).Determining whether a capital defendant killed withoutfeeling or sympathy is undoubtedly more difficult than, forexample, determining whether he "was previously convictedof another murder," Idaho Code $ 19-2515(g)(1) (1987). Butthat does not mean that a State cannot, consistent with theFederal Constitution, authorize sentencing judges to makethe inquiry and to take their findings into account when deciding whether capital punishment is warranted. This is theimport of Walton. In that case we considered Arizona's "especially heinous, cruel, or depraved" circumstance. The Arizona Supreme Court had held that a crime is committed ina "depraved" manner when the perpetrator " `relishes themurder, evidencing debasement or perversion,' or `shows anindifference to the suffering of the victim and evidences asense of pleasure' in the killing." Walton, supra, at 655(quoting State v. Walton, 159 Ariz. 571, 587, 769 P. 2d 1017,1033 (1989)). We concluded that this construction adequately guided sentencing discretion, even though "theproper degree of definition of an aggravating factor of thisnature is not susceptible of mathematical precision." 497U. S., at 655; accord, Jeffers, 497 U. S., at 777; cf. Proffitt v.Florida, 428 U. S. 242, 260 (1976) (White, J., concurring injudgment) (approving Florida statutory aggravating circumstances that, "although . . . not susceptible of mechanical ap507us2$49J 11-26-96 16:58:55 PAGES OPINPGT474 ARAVE v. CREECHOpinion of the Courtplication . . . are by no means so vague and overbroad as toleave the discretion of the sentencing authority unfettered").The language at issue here is no less "clear and objective"than the language sustained in Walton. Whether a defendant "relishes" or derives "pleasure" from his crime arguablymay be easier to determine than whether he acts withoutfeeling or sympathy, since enjoyment is an affirmative mental state, whereas the cold-bloodedness inquiry in a senserequires the sentencer to find a negative. But we do notthink so subtle a distinction has constitutional significance.The Osborn limiting construction, like the one upheld inWalton, defines a state of mind that is ascertainable fromsurrounding facts. Accordingly, we decline to invalidatethe "utter disregard" circumstance on the ground that theIdaho Supreme Court's limiting construction is insufficiently "objective."Of course, it is not enough for an aggravating circumstance, as construed by the state courts, to be determinate.Our precedents make clear that a State's capital sentencingscheme also must "genuinely narrow the class of personseligible for the death penalty." Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S.862, 877 (1983). When the purpose of a statutory aggravating circumstance is to enable the sentencer to distinguishthose who deserve capital punishment from those who donot, the circumstance must provide a principled basis fordoing so. See Jeffers, supra, at 776; Godfrey, 446 U. S., at433. If the sentencer fairly could conclude that an aggravating circumstance applies to every defendant eligible for thedeath penalty, the circumstance is constitutionally infirm.See Cartwright, supra, at 364 (invalidating aggravating circumstance that "an ordinary person could honestly believe"described every murder); Godfrey, supra, at 428-429 ("Aperson of ordinary sensibility could fairly characterize almost every murder as `outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman' ").507us2$49J 11-26-96 16:58:55 PAGES OPINPGT475Cite as: 507 U. S. 463 (1993)Opinion of the CourtAlthough the question is close, we believe the Osborn con-struction satisfies this narrowing requirement. The class ofmurderers eligible for capital punishment under Idaho law isdefined broadly to include all first-degree murderers. IdahoCode $ 18-4004 (1987). And the category of first-degreemurderers is also broad. It includes premeditated murdersand those carried out by means of poison, lying in wait, orcertain kinds of torture. $ 18-4003(a). In addition, mur-ders that otherwise would be classified as second degree,$ 18-4003(g)--including homicides committed without "con-siderable provocation" or under circumstances demonstrating "an abandoned and malignant heart" (a term of art thatrefers to unintentional homicide committed with extremerecklessness, see American Law Institute, Model Penal Code$ 210.2(1)(b) Comment, n. 4 (1980)), Idaho Code $$ 18-4001,18-4002 (1987)--become first degree if they are accompaniedby one of a number of enumerated circumstances. For example, murders are classified as first degree when the victimis a fellow prison inmate, $ 18-4003(e), or a law enforcementor judicial officer performing official duties, $ 18-4003(b);when the defendant is already serving a sentence for murder,$ 18-4003(c); and when the murder occurs during a prisonescape, $ 18-4003(f), or the commission or attempted commission of arson, rape, robbery, burglary, kidnaping, or mayhem, $ 18-4003(d). In other words, a sizable class of eventhose murderers who kill with some provocation or withoutspecific intent may receive the death penalty under Idaholaw.We acknowledge that, even within these broad categories,the word "pitiless," standing alone, might not narrow theclass of defendants eligible for the death penalty. A sentencing judge might conclude that every first-degree murderer is "pitiless," because it is difficult to imagine how aperson with any mercy or compassion could kill anotherhuman being without justification. Given the statutoryscheme, however, we believe that a sentencing judge reason507us2$49J 11-26-96 16:58:55 PAGES OPINPGT476 ARAVE v. CREECHOpinion of the Courtably could find that not all Idaho capital defendants are "cold-blooded." That is because some within the broad class offirst-degree murderers do exhibit feeling. Some, for exam-ple, kill with anger, jealousy, revenge, or a variety of otheremotions. In Walton we held that Arizona could treat capital defendants who take pleasure in killing as more deserv-ing of the death penalty than those who do not. Idaho similarly has identified the subclass of defendants who killwithout feeling or sympathy as more deserving of death.By doing so, it has narrowed in a meaningful way the cate-gory of defendants upon whom capital punishment may beimposed.Creech argues that the Idaho courts have not applied the"utter disregard" circumstance consistently. He points outthat the courts have found defendants to exhibit "utter disregard" in a wide range of cases. This, he claims, demonstrates that the circumstance is nothing more than a catchall. The dissent apparently agrees. See post, at 485-487.The State, in turn, offers its own review of the cases andcontends that they are consistent. In essence, the partiesand the dissent would have us determine the facial constitutionality of the "utter disregard" circumstance, as construedin Osborn, by examining applications of the circumstance incases not before us.As an initial matter, we do not think the fact that "[a]llkinds of . . . factors," post, at 486, may demonstrate the requisite state of mind renders the Osborn construction faciallyinvalid. That the Idaho courts may find first-degree murderers to be "cold-blooded" and "pitiless" in a wide range ofcircumstances is unsurprising. It also is irrelevant to thequestion before us. We did not undertake a comparativeanalysis of state court decisions in Walton. See 497 U. S.,at 655 (construing the argument that the aggravating circumstance "has been applied in an arbitrary manner" as achallenge to the state court's proportionality review). Andin Jeffers we stated clearly that the question whether state507us2$49J 11-26-96 16:58:55 PAGES OPINPGT477Cite as: 507 U. S. 463 (1993)Opinion of the Courtcourts properly have applied an aggravating circumstanceis separate from the question whether the circumstance, asnarrowed, is facially valid. See 497 U. S., at 778-780. Tobe sure, we previously have examined other state decisionswhen the construction of an aggravating circumstance hasbeen unclear. In Sochor v. Florida, 504 U. S. 527 (1992), forexample, the argument was that the state courts had notadhered to a single limiting construction of Florida's "hei-nous, atrocious, or cruel" circumstance.Id., at 536-537; seealso Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U. S., at 255, n. 12 ( joint opinionof Stewart, Powell, andStevens, JJ.) (reviewing other casesto establish that the state courts had construed an aggravating circumstance consistently). Under our precedents, afederal court may consider state court formulations of a limiting construction to ensure that they are consistent. Butour decisions do not authorize review of state court cases todetermine whether a limiting construction has been applied consistently.A comparative analysis of state court cases, moreover,would be particularly inappropriate here. The Idaho Supreme Court upheld Creech's death sentence in 1983--beforeit had applied Osborn to any other set of facts. None of thedecisions on which the dissent relies, or upon which Creechasks us to invalidate his death sentence, influenced either thetrial judge who sentenced Creech or the appellate judgeswho upheld the sentence. And there is no question that Idaho's formulation of its limiting construction has been consistent. The Idaho Supreme Court has reaffirmed its originalinterpretation of "utter disregard" repeatedly, often recitingthe definition given in Osborn verbatim. See, e. g., State v.Card, 121 Idaho 425, 435-436, 825 P. 2d 1081, 1091-1092(1991) (citing cases), cert. denied, 506 U. S. 915 (1992). Italso has explained that "utter disregard" differs from Idaho's"heinous, atrocious or cruel" aggravating circumstance,Idaho Code $ 19-2515(g)(5) (1987), because the Osborn construction focuses on the defendant's state of mind. State v.507us2$49J 11-26-96 16:58:55 PAGES OPINPGT478 ARAVE v. CREECHOpinion of the CourtFain, 116 Idaho 82, 99, 774 P. 2d 252, 269 ("[T]he `utter disre-gard' factor refers not to the outrageousness of the acts constituting the murder, but to the defendant's lack of conscien-tious scruples against killing another human being"), cert.denied, 493 U. S. 917 (1989). In light of the consistent nar-rowing definition given the "utter disregard" circumstanceby the Idaho Supreme Court, we are satisfied that the cir-cumstance, on its face, meets constitutional standards.IIICreech argues alternatively that the "utter disregard" cir-cumstance, even if facially valid, does not apply to him. Hesuggests--as did the Court of Appeals and as does the dis-sent,post, at 488--that the trial judge's findings that he wasprovoked and that he exhibited an "excessive violent rage"are irreconcilable with a finding of "utter disregard." TheIdaho Supreme Court, Creech claims, did not cure the erroron appeal. There also appears to be some question whetherthe other murders that Creech has committed, and the selfdefense explanations he has offered for some of them, bearon the "utter disregard" determination. See Tr. of OralArg. 5-7, 18-21; cf. post, at 488, n. 15.These are primarily questions of state law. As we saidin Jeffers, a state court's application of a valid aggravatingcircumstance violates the Constitution only if "no reasonablesentencer" could find the circumstance to exist. 497 U. S.,at 783. The Court of Appeals had no occasion to decide theJeffers issue in this case, since it found the "utter disregard"circumstance facially vague. The posture of the case, moreover, makes it unnecessary for us to reach the remainingarguments. The Court of Appeals granted Creech relief ontwo other claims: that the trial judge improperly refused toallow him to present new mitigating evidence when he wasresentenced in open court, and that the judge applied twoaggravating circumstances without making a finding required under state law. See 947 F. 2d, at 881-882. On the507us2$49J 11-26-96 16:58:55 PAGES OPINPGT479Cite as: 507 U. S. 463 (1993)Blackmun, J., dissentingbasis of the first claim, Creech is entitled to resentencing instate trial court. Id., at 882. Accordingly, we hold todayonly that the "utter disregard" circumstance, as defined inOsborn, on its face meets constitutional requirements. Thejudgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed inpart, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistentwith this opinion.
