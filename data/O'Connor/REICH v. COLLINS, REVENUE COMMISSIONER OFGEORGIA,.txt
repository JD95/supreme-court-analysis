In a long line of cases, this Court has established that dueprocess requires a "clear and certain" remedy for taxes collected in violation of federal law. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co.v.O'Connor, 223 U. S. 280, 285 (1912) (Holmes, J.). A Statehas the flexibility to provide that remedy before the disputedtaxes are paid (predeprivation), after they are paid (postdep-rivation), or both. But what it may not do, and what Georgia did here, is hold out what plainly appears to be a "clearand certain" postdeprivation remedy and then declare, onlyafter the disputed taxes have been paid, that no such rem-edy exists.IFor many years, numerous States, including Georgia, ex-empted from state personal income tax retirement benefitspaid by the State, but not retirement benefits paid by theFederal Government (or any other employer). In March1989, this Court held that such a tax scheme violates theconstitutional intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine,which dates back to McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316(1819), and has been generally codified at 4 U. S. C. $ 111.See Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803(1989).In the aftermath of Davis, most of these States, Georgiaincluded, repealed their special tax exemptions for state retirees, but few offered federal retirees any refunds for theunconstitutional taxes they had paid in the years beforeDavis was decided. Not surprisingly, a great deal of litiga-tion ensued in an effort to force States to provide refunds.The instant suit is part of that litigation.In April 1990, Reich, a retired federal military officer, suedGeorgia in Georgia state court, seeking a refund for the taxyears 1980 and after. The principal legal basis for Reich'sDeputy Attorneys General, and Marilyn R. Mudge, Assistant AttorneyGeneral, filed a brief for the State of North Carolina as amicus curiae.513us1$$8J 03-28-98 15:12:32 PAGES OPINPGT109Cite as: 513 U. S. 106 (1994)Opinion of the Courtlawsuit was Georgia's tax refund statute, which provides: "Ataxpayer shall be refunded any and all taxes or fees whichare determined to have been erroneously or illegally as-sessed and collected from him under the laws of this state,whether paid voluntarily or involuntarily . . . ." Ga. CodeAnn. $ 48-2-35(a) (Supp. 1994).The Georgia trial court first decided that, because of$ 48-2-35's statute of limitations, Reich's refund request waslimited to the tax years 1985 and after. Even as to theselater tax years, however, the trial court refused to grant arefund, and the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed. SeeReichv. Collins, 262 Ga. 625, 422 S. E. 2d 846 (1992) (Reich I).The Georgia high court explained that it was construingthe refund statute not to apply to "the situation wherethe law under which the taxes are assessed and collectedis itself subsequently declared to be unconstitutional orotherwise invalid." Id., at 628-629, 422 S. E. 2d, at 849.Reich then petitioned the Georgia Supreme Court for reconsideration of its decision on the grounds that even if theGeorgia tax refund statute does not require a refund, federaldue process does--due process, that is, as interpreted byMcKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18 (1990),and the long line of cases upon which McKesson depends.See id., at 32-36, citing Iowa-Des Moines Nat. Bank v. Bennett, 284 U. S. 239 (1931); Montana Nat. Bank of Billings v.Yellowstone County, 276 U. S. 499 (1928); Carpenter v. Shaw,280 U. S. 363 (1930); Ward v. Board of Commr's of Love Cty.,253 U. S. 17 (1920); Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. O'Connor,supra; see generally Fallon & Meltzer, New Law, NonRetroactivity, and Constitutional Remedies, 104 Harv. L.Rev. 1733, 1824-1830 (1991). As we said, these cases standfor the proposition that "a denial by a state court of a recovery of taxes exacted in violation of the laws or Constitutionof the United States by compulsion is itself in contraventionof the Fourteenth Amendment," Carpenter, supra, at 369,513us1$$8J 03-28-98 15:12:32 PAGES OPINPGT110 REICH v. COLLINSOpinion of the Courtthe sovereign immunity States traditionally enjoy in theirown courts notwithstanding. (We should note that the sovereign immunity States enjoy in federal court, under theEleventh Amendment, does generally bar tax refund claimsfrom being brought in that forum. See Ford Motor Co. v.Department of Treasury of Ind., 323 U. S. 459 (1945).)Reich's petition for reconsideration in light of McKessonwas denied. He then petitioned for certiorari. While thepetition was pending, we decided Harper v. Virginia Dept.of Taxation, 509 U. S. 86 (1993), which relied on McKessonin circumstances similar to this case. Accordingly, we remanded Reich's case to the Georgia Supreme Court for fur-ther consideration in light ofHarper. See Reich v. Collins,509 U. S. 918 (1993).On remand, the Georgia Supreme Court focused on theportion of Harper explaining that, under McKesson, a Stateis free to provide its "clear and certain" remedy in an exclu-sively predeprivation manner. "[A] meaningful opportunityfor taxpayers to withhold contested tax assessments and tochallenge their validity in a predeprivation hearing," wesaid, is " `a procedural safeguard [against unlawful depriva-tions] sufficient by itself to satisfy the Due Process Clause.' "See Harper, supra, at 101, quoting McKesson, supra, at 38,n. 21. The court then reviewed Georgia's predeprivationprocedures, found them "ample," and denied Reich's refundclaim.Reich v. Collins, 263 Ga. 602, 604, 437 S. E. 2d 320,322 (1993).Reich again petitioned for certiorari, and we granted thewrit, 510 U. S. 1109 (1994), to consider whether it was properfor the Georgia Supreme Court to deny Reich relief on thebasis of Georgia's predeprivation remedies.IIThe Georgia Supreme Court is no doubt right that, underMcKesson, Georgia has the flexibility to maintain an ex-clusively predeprivation remedial scheme, so long as that513us1$$8J 03-28-98 15:12:32 PAGES OPINPGT111Cite as: 513 U. S. 106 (1994)Opinion of the Courtscheme is "clear and certain." Due process, we should add,also allows the State to maintain an exclusively postdeprivation regime, see, e. g., Bob Jones Univ. v. Simon, 416 U. S.725, 746-748 (1974), or a hybrid regime. A State is free aswell to reconfigure its remedial scheme over time, to fit itschanging needs. Such choices are generally a matter onlyof state law.But what a State may not do, and what Georgia did here,is to reconfigure its scheme, unfairly, inmid-course--to "baitand switch," as some have described it. Specifically, in themid-1980's, Georgia held out what plainly appeared to be a"clear and certain" postdeprivation remedy, in the form ofits tax refund statute, and then declared, only after Reichand others had paid the disputed taxes, that no such remedyexists. In this regard, the Georgia Supreme Court's reliance on Georgia's predeprivation procedures was entirely beside the point (and thus error), because even assuming theconstitutional adequacy of these procedures--an issue onwhich we express no view--no reasonable taxpayer wouldhave thought that they represented, in light of the apparentapplicability of the refund statute, the exclusive remedy forunlawful taxes. See generally Rakowski, Harper and ItsAftermath, 1 Fla. Tax Rev. 445, 474 (1993).Nor can there be any question that, during the 1980's,prior to Reich I, Georgia did appear to hold out a "clearand certain" postdeprivation remedy. To recall, the Georgiarefund statute says that the State "shall" refund "any andall taxes or fees which are determined to have been erroneously or illegally assessed and collected from [a taxpayer]under the laws of this state, whether paid voluntarily or involuntarily . . . ." Ga. Code Ann. $ 48-2-35(a) (Supp. 1994)(emphasis added). In our view, the average taxpayer reading this language would think it obvious that state taxesassessed in violation of federal law are "illegally assessed"taxes. Certainly the United States Court of Appeals for theEleventh Circuit thought this conclusion was obvious when,513us1$$8J 03-28-98 15:12:32 PAGES OPINPGT112 REICH v. COLLINSOpinion of the Courtin a 1986 case, it denied federal court relief to taxpayersraising claims similar to Reich's, in part because it thoughtGeorgia's refund statute applied to the claims. See Waldronv.Collins, 788 F. 2d 736, 738, cert. denied, 479 U. S. 884(1986).Respondents, moreover, do not point to any Georgia Su-preme Court cases prior toReich I that put any limitingconstruction on the statute's sweeping language; indeed, thecases we have found are all entirely consistent with that language's apparent breadth. See, e. g., Georgia v. PrivateTruck Council of America, Inc., 258 Ga. 531, 371 S. E. 2d378 (1988); Henderson v. Carter, 229 Ga. 876, 195 S. E. 2d 4(1972); Parke, Davis & Co. v. Cook, 198 Ga. 457, 31 S. E. 2d728 (1944); Wright v. Forrester, 192 Ga. 864, 16 S. E. 2d 873(1941). Even apart from the statute and the cases, we findit significant that, for obvious reasons, States ordinarily prefer that taxpayers pursue only postdeprivation remedies,i. e., that taxpayers "pay first, litigate later." This preference is significant in that it would seem especially unfair topenalize taxpayers who may have ignored the possibility ofpursuing predeprivation remedies out of respect for thatpreference.In many ways, then, this case bears a remarkable resemblance to NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S.449 (1958) (Harlan, J.). There, an Alabama trial court heldthe National Association for the Advancement of ColoredPeople in contempt for failing to comply with a discoveryorder to produce its membership lists, and the Alabama Supreme Court denied review of the constitutionality of thecontempt judgment on the grounds that the organizationfailed earlier to pursue a mandamus action to quash the underlying discovery order. The Court found that the Alabama high court's refusal to review the contempt judgmentwas in error. Prior Alabama law, the Court said, showed"unambiguous[ly]" that judicial review of contempt judgments had consistently been available, the existence of man513us1$$8J 03-28-98 15:12:32 PAGES OPINPGT113Cite as: 513 U. S. 106 (1994)Opinion of the Courtdamus notwithstanding. Id., at 456. For good measure,the Court also looked at prior Alabama law on mandamusand found nothing "suggest[ing] that mandamus is the exclusive remedy" in this situation. Id., at 457 (emphasis inoriginal). Justice Harlan thus concluded: "Novelty in procedural requirements cannot be permitted to thwart review inthis Court applied for by those who, in justified relianceupon prior decisions, seek vindication in state courts oftheir federal constitutional rights."Id., at 457-458, citingBrinkerhoff-Faris Trust & Sav. Co. v. Hill, 281 U. S. 673(1930) (due process violated when state court denied injunction against collection of unlawful taxes on the basis of taxpayer's failure to pursue administrative remedies, whereState's prior "settled" law made clear that no such administrative remedies existed); see generally Meltzer, State CourtForfeitures of Federal Rights, 99 Harv. L. Rev. 1128, 1137-1139 (1986).Finally, Georgia contends that Reich had no idea (beforeDavis) that the taxes he was paying throughout the 1980'smight be unconstitutional. Even assuming Reich had noidea, however, we are not sure we understand the argument.If the argument is that Reich would not have taken advantage of the State's predeprivation remedies no matter howadequate they were (and thus has no standing to complain ofthose remedies), the argument is beside the point for thesame reason that we said that the Georgia Supreme Court'sreliance on those remedies was beside the point: Reich wasentitled to pursue what appeared to be a "clear and certain"postdeprivation remedy, regardless of the State's predeprivation remedies. Alternatively, if the argument is thatReich needed to have known of the unconstitutionality of histaxes in order to pursue the State's postdeprivation remedy,the argument is wrong. It is wrong because Georgia's refund statute has a relatively lengthy statute of limitationsperiod, and, at least until this case, see Reich I, 262 Ga., at629, 422 S. E. 2d, at 849, contained no contemporaneous pro513us1$$8J 03-28-98 15:12:32 PAGES OPINPGT114 REICH v. COLLINSOpinion of the Courttest requirement. Under such a regime, taxpayers need nothave taken any steps to learn of the possible unconstitutionality of their taxes at the time they paid them. Accordingly,they may not now be put in any worse position for havingfailed to take such steps.For the reasons stated, the judgment is reversed andthe case is remanded for the provision of " `meaningfulbackward-looking relief,' "Harper, 509 U. S., at 101, quotingMcKesson, 496 U. S., at 31, consistent with due process andour McKesson line of cases. See, e. g., Carpenter v. Shaw,280 U. S. 363 (1930).
