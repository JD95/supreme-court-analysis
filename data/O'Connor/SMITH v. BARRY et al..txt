Rule 3 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure condi-tions federal appellate jurisdiction on the filing of a timelynotice of appeal. In this case, we hold that a document in-tended to serve as an appellate brief may qualify as the notice of appeal required by Rule 3.IWhile an inmate at the Maryland State Penitentiary, peti-tioner William Smith filed a pro se action against two prisonadministrators, seven corrections officers, two state psychol-ogists, and named respondent Dr. Wayne Barry, a privatephysician. Suing under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, Smith allegedthat he suffered from a psychogenic pain disorder and thatthe defendants' refusal to provide him with a wheelchair con-stituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of theEighth Amendment. Smith further alleged that the officersused excessive force against him, also in violation of theEighth Amendment.The District Court dismissed Dr. Barry as a defendant onthe ground that he did not act under color of state law whentreating Smith and therefore was not subject to suit under$ 1983. App. 5-6. The case proceeded to trial in 1988, fol-lowing appointment of counsel. After Smith presented hiscase in chief, the District Court directed a verdict for theprison administrators and officers on Smith's wheelchair502us2$20J 01-22-99 14:22:41 PAGES OPINPGT246 SMITH v. BARRYOpinion of the Courtclaim, and for the administrators and three officers on hisexcessive force claim. The jury ultimately rejected Smith'sexcessive force claim against the four remaining officers.However, it found that the staff psychologists were deliberately indifferent to Smith's medical needs and awarded$15,000 in damages.The two psychologists filed a timely motion for judgmentnotwithstanding the verdict (J. N. O. V.). Without consulting his attorney, and while the motion for J. N. O. V. waspending, Smith filed a notice of appeal. Smith's trial counsellearned of the notice of appeal after the District Court denied the psychologists' motion. In a letter dated April 21,1988, he wrote Smith:"I am certain from the circumstances that [the notice ofappeal] is premature and thus void.". . . The Order denying the Motion for J. N. O. V. wasentered April 13, 1988. This would give you up untilMay 13, 1988 before you must file an appeal. I wouldurge you to take by [sic] advice and not file an appeal,or at least seek a second legal opinion on the matter."App. 17.Smith's notice of appeal was in fact invalid under FederalRule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4), which provides that anotice of appeal filed before the disposition of a timelyJ. N. O. V. motion is without effect. Although the FourthCircuit's jurisdiction had not been properly invoked, its Clerkresponded to the notice of appeal by sending all of the parties copies of the "informal brief " the court uses in pro seappeals and an order explaining the court's procedures. Thebriefing forms asked the parties to answer six questionsabout their legal positions. Under its Rules, the Fourth Circuit reviews these responses and the record to determinewhether appointment of counsel and/or oral argument arewarranted. See CA4 Rule 34(b). Smith returned his infor502us2$20J 01-22-99 14:22:41 PAGES OPINPGT247Cite as: 502 U. S. 244 (1992)Opinion of the Courtmal brief to the Court of Appeals on May 4, 1988, within thedeadline for filing a notice of appeal.After appointment of appellate counsel, the Fourth Circuitdismissed Smith's appeal for want of jurisdiction. It heldthat Smith's notice of appeal was untimely and that his infor-mal brief was not "the `functional equivalent' " of the noticeof appeal Rule 3 requires. Smith v. Galley, 919 F. 2d 893,895 (1990) (quotingTorres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487U. S. 312, 317 (1988)). The court reasoned that Smith filedthe informal brief in response to a briefing order and thatthe Federal Rules envision that the notice of appeal and theappellate brief will be two separate documents. 919 F. 2d,at 895-896. In a footnote, the court listed specific omissionsthat might render Smith's informal brief inadequate as a no-tice of appeal.Id., at 896, n. 7. Given its conclusion that abrief can never be considered a notice of appeal, however,the Fourth Circuit expressed no opinion on the significanceof these omissions. Ibid.We granted certiorari, 501 U. S. 1249 (1991), to decidewhether an appellate brief may serve as the notice of appealrequired by Rule 3. This question has divided the Courtsof Appeals. CompareSmith v. Galley, supra; United Statesv. Cooper, 876 F. 2d 1192, 1196 (CA5 1989) (appellate briefcannot substitute for notice of appeal); and Jurgens v.McKasy, 905 F. 2d 382, 385, n. 4 (CA Fed. 1990) (same), withFrace v. Russell, 341 F. 2d 901, 903 (CA3) (treating brief asnotice of appeal), cert. denied, 382 U. S. 863 (1965);Allah v.Superior Court of California, 871 F. 2d 887, 889-890 (CA91989) (same); and Finch v. Vernon, 845 F. 2d 256, 259-260(CA11 1988) (same).IIFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(a) provides, in per-tinent part, that "[a]n appeal permitted by law as of rightfrom a district court to a court of appeals shall be taken byfiling a notice of appeal with the clerk of the district courtwithin the time allowed by Rule 4." Rule 3(c) governs the502us2$20J 01-22-99 14:22:41 PAGES OPINPGT248 SMITH v. BARRYOpinion of the Courtcontent of notices of appeal: Notices "shall specify the partyor parties taking the appeal; shall designate the judgment,order or part thereof appealed from; and shall name thecourt to which the appeal is taken."Courts will liberally construe the requirements of Rule 3.See Torres, supra, at 316; Foman v. Davis, 371 U. S. 178,181-182 (1962). Thus, when papers are "technically at variance with the letter of [Rule 3], a court may nonetheless findthat the litigant has complied with the rule if the litigant'saction is the functional equivalent of what the rule requires."Torres, supra, at 316-317. This principle of liberal construction does not, however, excuse noncompliance with theRule. Rule 3's dictates are jurisdictional in nature, andtheir satisfaction is a prerequisite to appellate review. Torres, supra. Although courts should construe Rule 3 liberally when determining whether it has been complied with,noncompliance is fatal to an appeal.In this case, the Court of Appeals recognized that it wasrequired to determine whether Smith's brief was the "functional equivalent" of the formal notice of appeal demandedby Rule 3, 919 F. 2d, at 895, but it erred in applying thatstandard. The court reasoned that because Smith filed hisinformal brief in response to a briefing order, "the documentwas not the result of Smith's intent to initiate an appeal."Id., at 895-896. This logic is dubious, since Smith receivedthe briefing form as a result of filing a notice of appeal, albeita premature one.More importantly, the court should not have relied onSmith's reasons for filing the brief. While a notice of appealmust specifically indicate the litigant's intent to seek appellate review, see Foman, supra, at 181; Torres, 487 U. S., at317-318, the purpose of this requirement is to ensure thatthe filing provides sufficient notice to other parties and thecourts. See id., at 318. Thus, the notice afforded by a document, not the litigant's motivation in filing it, determinesthe document's sufficiency as a notice of appeal. If a docu502us2$20J 01-22-99 14:22:41 PAGES OPINPGT249Cite as: 502 U. S. 244 (1992)Opinion of the Courtment filed within the time specified by Rule 4 gives the notice required by Rule 3, it is effective as a notice of appeal.The Fourth Circuit's other ground for dismissing Smith'sappeal is also insufficient. The Federal Rules do envisionthat the notice of appeal and the appellant's brief will be twoseparate filings. Compare Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3(c) (content of notice of appeal) with Fed. Rule App. Proc. 28(a) (content of appellant's brief). They do not preclude an appellatecourt from treating a filing styled as a brief as a notice ofappeal, however, if the filing is timely under Rule 4 and conveys the information required by Rule 3(c). Such treatmentis in fact appropriate under Torres and under Rule 3(c)'s provision that "[a]n appeal shall not be dismissed for informalityof form or title of the notice of appeal."Having accepted a paper as the notice of appeal requiredby Rule 3, an appellate court might require timely filing of asecond document meeting its standards for a brief or, if thepaper meets those standards, take such other action as itdeems appropriate to ensure that the filing sequence contemplated by the Rules is not disturbed. See, e. g., Fed. RuleApp. Proc. 10(b) (time for ordering transcripts for inclusionin the record on appeal); Fed. Rule App. Proc. 31(a) (briefingschedule). Proper briefing is not, however, a jurisdictionalrequirement under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3(a) ("Failure of an appellant to take any step other than the timely filing of a noticeof appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal . . .").Respondents make the point that Smith filed his brief withthe Court of Appeals, whereas Rule 3(a) directs litigants tofile their notices of appeal with district courts. The Rulesthemselves answer this argument. Rule 4(a)(1) sets out atransmittal procedure to be followed when the notice of appeal is mistakenly filed with an appellate court, and providesthat a misfiled notice "shall be deemed filed in the districtcourt" on the day it was received by the court of appeals.502us2$20J 01-22-99 14:22:41 PAGES OPINPGT250 SMITH v. BARRYScalia, J., concurring in judgmentFinally, respondents argue that Smith's brief is not an ade-quate notice of appeal because it lacks information requiredby Rule 3(c). Having held that an informal brief can neversubstitute for a formal notice of appeal, the Court of Appealsdeclined to reach this question. 919 F. 2d, at 896, n. 7. Onremand, it should undertake the appropriate analysis. See,e. g., Foman, supra; Torres, supra.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, andthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.
