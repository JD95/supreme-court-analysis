We confront here the problem of a "mixed" petition forhabeas corpus relief in which a state prisoner presents a federal court with a single petition containing some claims thathave been exhausted in the state courts and some that havenot. More precisely, we consider whether a federal districtcourt has discretion to stay the mixed petition to allow thepetitioner to present his unexhausted claims to the state*A brief of amicus curiae urging reversal was filed for the NationalAssociation of Criminal Defense Lawyers by Pamela Harris and DavidM.

WEBEROpinion of the Courtcourt in the first instance, and then to return to federal courtfor review of his perfected petition.IPetitioner Charles Russell Rhines was convicted in SouthDakota state court of first-degree murder and third-degreeburglary and sentenced to death. His conviction becamefinal on December 2, 1996, when we denied his initial petitionfor certiorari. Rhines v. South Dakota, 519 U. S. 1013. OnDecember 5, 1996, Rhines filed a petition for state habeascorpus. App. 32. The state court denied his petition, andthe Supreme Court of South Dakota affirmed on February 9,2000, Rhines v. Weber, 2000 SD 19, 608 N. W. 2d 303. Rhinesfiled hispro se petition for federal habeas corpus pursuantto 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 in the United States District Court forthe District of South Dakota on February 22, 2000. App.3. Because the 1-year statute of limitations imposed by theAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996(AEDPA) was tolled while Rhines' state habeas corpus petition was pending, see 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d)(2), he still hadmore than 11 months left before the expiration of the limitations period.With the assistance of court-appointed counsel, Rhinesfiled an amended petition for writ of habeas corpus and state-ment of exhaustion on November 20, 2000, asserting 35claims of constitutional defects in his conviction and sen-tence. App. 39-60. The State challenged 12 of those claimsas unexhausted. Id., at 72-79. On July 3, 2002, approxi-mately 18 months after Rhines had filed his amended federalhabeas corpus petition, the District Court held that 8 ofthe 35 claims had not been exhausted. At this time, theAEDPA 1-year statute of limitations had run. See Duncanv.Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 181-182 (2001) (holding that thestatute of limitations is not tolled during the pendancy ofa federal petition). As a result, if the District Court haddismissed Rhines' mixed petition at that point, he would544US1 Unit: $U36 [11-02-07 18:40:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN273Cite as: 544 U. S. 269 (2005)Opinion of the Courthave been unable to refile in federal court after exhaustingthe unexhausted claims. Rhines therefore moved the District Court to hold his pending habeas petition in abeyancewhile he presented his unexhausted claims to the SouthDakota courts. On July 3, 2002, the District Court grantedthe motion and issued a stay "conditioned upon petitionercommencing state court exhaustion proceedings within sixtydays of this order and returning to this court within sixtydays of completing such exhaustion." App. 136. In compli-ance with that order, Rhines filed his second state habeascorpus petition on August 22, 2002.The State appealed the District Court's stay of Rhines'mixed petition to the United States Court of Appeals for theEighth Circuit. Relying on its decision inAkins v. Kenney,341 F. 3d 681, 686 (2003) (holding that "a district court hasno authority to hold a habeas petition containing unex-hausted claims in abeyance absent truly exceptional circumstances" (internal quotation marks omitted)), the Court ofAppeals vacated the stay and remanded the case to the District Court to determine whether Rhines could proceed bydeleting unexhausted claims from his petition. 346 F. 3d 799(2003). We granted certiorari to resolve a split in the Cir-cuits regarding the propriety of the District Court's "stayand-abeyance" procedure. 542 U. S. 936 (2004). Compare,e. g., Crews v. Horn, 360 F. 3d 146, 152 (CA3 2004); andZarvela v. Artuz, 254 F. 3d 374, 381 (CA2 2001), with 346F. 3d 799 (2003) (case below).IIFourteen years before Congress enacted AEDPA, we heldinRose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509 (1982), that federal districtcourts may not adjudicate mixed petitions for habeas corpus,that is, petitions containing both exhausted and unexhaustedclaims. We reasoned that the interests of comity and federalism dictate that state courts must have the first opportu-nity to decide a petitioner's claims.Id., at 518-519. We544US1 Unit: $U36 [11-02-07 18:40:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN274 RHINES v. WEBEROpinion of the Courtnoted that "[b]ecause `it would be unseemly in our dual sys-tem of government for a federal district court to upset astate court conviction without an opportunity to the statecourts to correct a constitutional violation,' federal courtsapply the doctrine of comity." Id., at 518 (quoting Darr v.Burford, 339 U. S. 200, 204 (1950)). That doctrine " `teachesthat one court should defer action on causes properly withinits jurisdiction until the courts of another sovereignty withconcurrent powers, and already cognizant of the litigation,have had an opportunity to pass upon the matter.' " 455U. S., at 518.Accordingly, we imposed a requirement of "total exhaustion" and directed federal courts to effectuate that requirement by dismissing mixed petitions without prejudice andallowing petitioners to return to state court to present theunexhausted claims to that court in the first instance. Id.,at 522. When we decided Lundy, there was no statute oflimitations on the filing of federal habeas corpus petitions.As a result, petitioners who returned to state court to exhaust their previously unexhausted claims could come backto federal court to present their perfected petitions with relative ease. See Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 486 (2000)(dismissal without prejudice under Lundy "contemplatedthat the prisoner could return to federal court after the requisite exhaustion").The enactment of AEDPA in 1996 dramatically alteredthe landscape for federal habeas corpus petitions. AEDPApreserved Lundy's total exhaustion requirement, see 28U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(1)(A) ("An application for a writ of habeascorpus . . . shall not be granted unless it appears that . . . theapplicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courtsof the State"), but it also imposed a 1-year statute of limitations on the filing of federal petitions, $ 2244(d). Althoughthe limitations period is tolled during the pendency of a"properly filed application for State post-conviction or othercollateral review," $ 2244(d)(2), the filing of a petition for ha544US1 Unit: $U36 [11-02-07 18:40:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN275Cite as: 544 U. S. 269 (2005)Opinion of the Courtbeas corpus in federal court does not toll the statute of limitations, Duncan, 533 U. S., at 181-182.As a result of the interplay between AEDPA's 1-year statute of limitations and Lundy's dismissal requirement, petitioners who come to federal court with "mixed" petitions runthe risk of forever losing their opportunity for any federalreview of their unexhausted claims. If a petitioner files atimely but mixed petition in federal district court, and thedistrict court dismisses it under Lundy after the limitationsperiod has expired, this will likely mean the termination ofany federal review. For example, if the District Court inthis case had dismissed the petition because it contained unexhausted claims, AEDPA's 1-year statute of limitationswould have barred Rhines from returning to federal courtafter exhausting the previously unexhausted claims in statecourt. Similarly, if a district court dismisses a mixed petition close to the end of the 1-year period, the petitioner'schances of exhausting his claims in state court and refilinghis petition in federal court before the limitations periodruns are slim. The problem is not limited to petitioners whofile close to the AEDPA deadline. Even a petitioner whofiles early will have no way of controlling when the district court will resolve the question of exhaustion. Thus,whether a petitioner ever receives federal review of hisclaims may turn on which district court happens to hear hiscase.We recognize the gravity of this problem and the difficultyit has posed for petitioners and federal district courts alike.In an attempt to solve the problem, some district courts haveadopted a version of the "stay-and-abeyance" procedure employed by the District Court below. Under this procedure,rather than dismiss the mixed petition pursuant to Lundy, adistrict court might stay the petition and hold it in abeyancewhile the petitioner returns to state court to exhaust hispreviously unexhausted claims. Once the petitioner ex544US1 Unit: $U36 [11-02-07 18:40:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN276 RHINES v. WEBEROpinion of the Courthausts his state remedies, the district court will lift the stayand allow the petitioner to proceed in federal court.District courts do ordinarily have authority to issue stays,seeLandis v. North American Co., 299 U. S. 248, 254 (1936),where such a stay would be a proper exercise of discretion,seeClinton v. Jones, 520 U. S. 681, 706 (1997). AEDPAdoes not deprive district courts of that authority, cf. 28U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(1)(A) ("An application for a writ of habeascorpus . . . shall not begranted unless it appears that . . . theapplicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courtsof the State" (emphasis added)), but it does circumscribetheir discretion. Any solution to this problem must therefore be compatible with AEDPA's purposes.One of the statute's purposes is to "reduce delays in theexecution of state and federal criminal sentences, particularly in capital cases." Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U. S. 202,206 (2003). See also Duncan, 533 U. S., at 179. AEDPA's1-year limitations period "quite plainly serves the wellrecognized interest in the finality of state court judgments."Ibid. It "reduces the potential for delay on the road to finality by restricting the time that a prospective federalhabeas petitioner has in which to seek federal habeas review." Ibid.Moreover, Congress enacted AEDPA against the backdropof Lundy's total exhaustion requirement. The tolling provision in $ 2244(d)(2) "balances the interests served by the exhaustion requirement and the limitation period" "by protecting a state prisoner's ability later to apply for federal habeasrelief while state remedies are being pursued." Duncan,supra, at 179. AEDPA thus encourages petitioners to seekrelief from state courts in the first instance by tolling the1-year limitations period while a "properly filed applicationfor State post-conviction or other collateral review" is pending. 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d)(2). This scheme reinforces theimportance of Lundy's "simple and clear instruction to potential litigants: before you bring any claims to federal court,544US1 Unit: $U36 [11-02-07 18:40:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN277Cite as: 544 U. S. 269 (2005)Opinion of the Courtbe sure that you first have taken each one to state court."455 U. S., at 520.Stay and abeyance, if employed too frequently, has the po-tential to undermine these twin purposes. Staying a federalhabeas petition frustrates AEDPA's objective of encouragingfinality by allowing a petitioner to delay the resolution of thefederal proceedings. It also undermines AEDPA's goal ofstreamlining federal habeas proceedings by decreasing apetitioner's incentive to exhaust all his claims in state courtprior to filing his federal petition. Cf. Duncan, supra, at180 ("[D]iminution of statutory incentives to proceed first instate court would . . . increase the risk of the very piecemeallitigation that the exhaustion requirement is designed toreduce").For these reasons, stay and abeyance should be availableonly in limited circumstances. Because granting a stay effectively excuses a petitioner's failure to present his claimsfirst to the state courts, stay and abeyance is only appropriate when the district court determines there was goodcause for the petitioner's failure to exhaust his claims firstin state court. Moreover, even if a petitioner had goodcause for that failure, the district court would abuse its discretion if it were to grant him a stay when his unexhaustedclaims are plainly meritless. Cf. 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(2) ("Anapplication for a writ of habeas corpus may be denied on themerits, notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the State").Even where stay and abeyance is appropriate, the districtcourt's discretion in structuring the stay is limited by thetimeliness concerns reflected in AEDPA. A mixed petitionshould not be stayed indefinitely. Though, generally, a prisoner's "principal interest . . . is in obtaining speedy federalrelief on his claims," Lundy, supra, at 520 (plurality opinion),not all petitioners have an incentive to obtain federal reliefas quickly as possible. In particular, capital petitionersmight deliberately engage in dilatory tactics to prolong their544US1 Unit: $U36 [11-02-07 18:40:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN278 RHINES v. WEBEROpinion of the Courtincarceration and avoid execution of the sentence of death.Without time limits, petitioners could frustrate AEDPA'sgoal of finality by dragging out indefinitely their federal ha-beas review. Thus, district courts should place reasonabletime limits on a petitioner's trip to state court and back.See,e. g., Zarvela, 254 F. 3d, at 381 ("[District courts] shouldexplicitly condition the stay on the prisoner's pursuing statecourt remedies within a brief interval, normally 30 days,after the stay is entered and returning to federal courtwithin a similarly brief interval, normally 30 days after statecourt exhaustion is completed"). And if a petitioner engages in abusive litigation tactics or intentional delay, thedistrict court should not grant him a stay at all. See id.,at 380-381.On the other hand, it likely would be an abuse of discretionfor a district court to deny a stay and to dismiss a mixedpetition if the petitioner had good cause for his failure toexhaust, his unexhausted claims are potentially meritorious, and there is no indication that the petitioner engagedin intentionally dilatory litigation tactics. In such circumstances, the district court should stay, rather than dismiss,the mixed petition. See Lundy, 455 U. S., at 522 (the totalexhaustion requirement was not intended to "unreasonablyimpair the prisoner's right to relief "). In such a case, thepetitioner's interest in obtaining federal review of his claimsoutweighs the competing interests in finality and speedy resolution of federal petitions. For the same reason, if a petitioner presents a district court with a mixed petition and thecourt determines that stay and abeyance is inappropriate,the court should allow the petitioner to delete the unexhausted claims and to proceed with the exhausted claims ifdismissal of the entire petition would unreasonably impairthe petitioner's right to obtain federal relief. See id., at 520(plurality opinion) ("[A petitioner] can always amend thepetition to delete the unexhausted claims, rather than returning to state court to exhaust all of his claims").544US1 Unit: $U36 [11-02-07 18:40:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN279Cite as: 544 U. S. 269 (2005)Opinion of Souter, J.The Court of Appeals erred to the extent it concluded thatstay and abeyance is always impermissible. We thereforevacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand thecase for that court to determine, consistent with this opinion,whether the District Court's grant of a stay in this case con-stituted an abuse of discretion.
