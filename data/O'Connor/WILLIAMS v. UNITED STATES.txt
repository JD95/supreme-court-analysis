The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Act), as amended, 18U. S. C. $ 3551et seq., 28 U. S. C. $$ 991-998, created theUnited States Sentencing Commission and empowered it topromulgate guidelines establishing sentencing ranges for different categories of federal offenses and defendants. The503us1$43D 11-13-95 22:53:53 PAGES OPINPGT196 WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtAct permits a district court to depart from the presumptivesentencing range prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelinesonly in certain circumstances. 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(b). TheAct also provides for limited appellate review of sentencesin order to ensure the proper application of the Guidelines.$ 3742. In this case, we consider the scope of appellate review, under the Act, of a sentence in which a district courthas departed from the guideline sentencing range.IPetitioner Joseph Williams, a previously convicted felon,was the subject of an investigation conducted by the Bureauof Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in 1988 and 1989. He wasindicted and convicted after a jury trial in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Western District of Wisconsin for possession of a firearm while a convicted felon in violation of 18U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1).The presentence report assigned Williams a criminal history category of V. App. 48. Combined with an offenselevel of 9, the applicable sentencing range under the Guidelines was 18 to 24 months. Ibid. The District Court departed upward from this range pursuant to $ 4A1.3 of theGuidelines Manual, which allows a district court to increasea criminal history classification if "reliable information" indicates that the criminal history category does not adequatelyreflect the seriousness of the defendant's criminal background or propensity for future criminal conduct. UnitedStates Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 4A1.3,p. s. (Nov. 1991) (USSG). The District Court determinedthat Williams' criminal history category was inadequate because it did not include two convictions that were too old tobe counted in the Guidelines' criminal history calculation, see$ 4A1.2(e)(1), and because it did not reflect several prior arrests. App. 53-54. Citing these two factors, the courtlooked to the next highest criminal history category, for503us1$43D 11-13-95 22:53:53 PAGES OPINPGT197Cite as: 503 U. S. 193 (1992)Opinion of the Courtwhich the guideline range was 21 to 27 months. Id., at 53-54. The court then sentenced Williams to 27 months' imprisonment and explained that it was selecting a sentence atthe high end of the guideline range because Williams hadpreviously been convicted for the same offense and becausehe had threatened an undercover agent in this case. Id.,at 55-56.1The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld the conviction and the sentence. 910 F. 2d 1574(1990). It agreed with the District Court that, under thecircumstances of this case, the two outdated convictions were"reliable information" indicating more extensive criminalconduct than was reflected by Williams' criminal historycategory. Id., at 1579. It rejected, however, the DistrictCourt's reliance upon Williams' prior arrests not resulting inprosecution. Although the Guidelines allow a court to consider "prior similar adult criminal conduct not resulting in acriminal conviction" in determining whether a departure iswarranted, they prohibit a court from basing a departure ona prior arrest record alone. USSG $ 4A1.3, p. s. The Courtof Appeals asserted that "the determination that the arrestsindicated similar criminal conduct must be based on factsapart from the arrest record itself," 910 F. 2d, at 1580, andheld that the District Court had not adequately explainedthe factual basis for its use of Williams' prior arrests as aground for departure. Ibid.Although it invalidated one of the two grounds mentionedby the District Court in its decision to depart, the Court ofAppeals nevertheless affirmed Williams' sentence. It reliedupon the Seventh Circuit precedent of United States v.Franklin, 902 F. 2d 501 (CA7), cert. denied sub nom. Mann1 Our reading of the sentencing transcript thus does not accord with thedissent's understanding that the District Court also considered Williams'prior conviction for the same offense in its decision to depart. See post,at 208.503us1$43D 11-13-95 22:53:53 PAGES OPINPGT198 WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtv. United States, 498 U. S. 906 (1990), which held that whena sentencing court uses both proper and improper factorsto justify a departure, the sentence can be affirmed if it isreasonable in light of the proper factors standing alone. 902F. 2d, at 508-509. Applying Franklin, the Court of Appealsconcluded that, despite the District Court's error in considering Williams' prior arrest record, the court had "correctlydetermined that Mr. Williams' criminality was not reflectedproperly in the criminal history category and that the rele-vant evidence justified the rather modest increase in sentence." 910 F. 2d, at 1580.We granted certiorari, 499 U. S. 918 (1991), to resolve aconflict among the Circuits on whether a reviewing courtmay affirm a sentence in which a district court's departurefrom the guideline range is based on both valid and invalidfactors. Compare United States v. Zamarripa, 905 F. 2d337, 342 (CA10 1990) (when one or more of the statedgrounds for departure is invalid, the case must be remandedfor resentencing); United States v. Hernandez-Vasquez, 884F. 2d 1314, 1315-1316 (CA9 1989) (same), withUnited Statesv. Franklin, supra, at 508-509 (when one or more of thestated grounds for departure is invalid, appellate court mayaffirm if sentence is still reasonable in light of remaining factors); United States v.

S. 970 (1991).IIThe Act provides that a district court may depart from thesentencing range set by the Guidelines only when it findsthat "there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstanceof a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating theguidelines." 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(b). A defendant may file anappeal if a sentence was imposed in violation of law or as a503us1$43D 11-13-95 22:53:53 PAGES OPINPGT199Cite as: 503 U. S. 193 (1992)Opinion of the Courtresult of an incorrect application of the Guidelines, or if thedistrict court departed upward from the guideline range.$ 3742(a). Similarly, the Government may file an appeal if asentence was imposed in violation of law or as a result of anincorrect application of the Guidelines, or if the district courtdeparted downward from the guideline range. $ 3742(b).For both types of appeal, $ 3742(f) delineates the followingnarrow scope of review:"If the court of appeals determines that the sentence--"(1) was imposed in violation of law or imposed as aresult of an incorrect application of the sentencingguidelines, the court shall remand the case for furthersentencing proceedings with such instructions as thecourt considers appropriate;"(2) is outside the applicable guideline range and isunreasonable or was imposed for an offense for whichthere is no applicable sentencing guideline and is plainlyunreasonable, it shall state specific reasons for its conclusions and--"(A) if it determines that the sentence is too high andthe appeal has been filed [by the defendant], it shall setaside the sentence and remand the case for further sen-tencing proceedings with such instructions as the courtconsiders appropriate;"(B) if it determines that the sentence is too low and theappeal has been filed [by the Government], it shall setaside the sentence and remand the case for further sentencing proceedings with such instructions as the courtconsiders appropriate;"(3) is not described in paragraph (1) or (2), it shallaffirm the sentence."AIn the case before us, Williams urges that the DistrictCourt's use of his arrest record as a ground for departurewas a misapplication of the Guidelines and that the "incor503us1$43D 11-13-95 22:53:53 PAGES OPINPGT200 WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtrect application" standard of $ 3742(f )(1) means that once adeparture ground is invalidated, a remand is always in order.The Government does not dispute that a district court's reli-ance upon an invalid factor in departing from the guidelinesentencing range is appropriately characterized as an "incorrect application" of the Guidelines, but contends that a re-mand is only required when the error was determinative inthe decision to depart.We agree with both parties that a sentencing court's useof an invalid departure ground is an incorrect application ofthe Guidelines. The Guidelines echo the Act's instructionthat a district court may depart from the applicable guidelinerange only when it finds an aggravating or mitigating circumstance " `not adequately taken into consideration bythe Sentencing Commission' " in formulating the Guidelines.USSG $ 1A4(b), p. s., $ 5K2.0, p. s. (both quoting 18 U. S. C.$ 3553(b)). Construing the plain language of the GuidelinesManual and the governing statute, we conclude that it is anincorrect application of the Guidelines for a district court todepart from the applicable sentencing range based on a factor that the Commission has already fully considered in establishing the guideline range or, as in this case, on a factorthat the Commission has expressly rejected as an appropriate ground for departure.Congress has defined "guidelines" as "the guidelinespromulgated by the commission pursuant to section 994(a)."28 U. S. C. $ 998(c). Section 994(a) grants the Commissionthe authority to promulgate both "guidelines," $ 994(a)(1),and "general policy statements regarding application of theguidelines," $ 994(a)(2). The dissent draws a distinction between the "actual" guidelines and the policy statements that"interpre[t]" and "explai[n]" them; in the dissent's view, onlythe former can be incorrectly applied within the meaningof 18 U. S. C. $ 3742(f )(1). Post, at 211-212. But to saythat guidelines are distinct from policy statements is not tosay that their meaning is unaffected by policy statements.503us1$43D 11-13-95 22:53:53 PAGES OPINPGT201Cite as: 503 U. S. 193 (1992)Opinion of the CourtWhere, as here, a policy statement prohibits a district courtfrom taking a specified action, the statement is an authoritative guide to the meaning of the applicable Guideline. Anerror in interpreting such a policy statement could lead toan incorrect determination that a departure was appropriate.In that event, the resulting sentence would be one that was"imposed as a result of an incorrect application of thesentencing guidelines" within the meaning of $ 3742(f)(1).2Similarly, an erroneous calculation under the SentencingTable, from which all Guidelines sentencing ranges are derived, could properly be reviewed as an "incorrect applica-tion of the sentencing guidelines" under $ 3742(f )(1) eventhough the Table itself is not officially designated as a"guideline." See USSG ch. 5, pt. A.Because use of a departure ground prohibited by a policystatement can be an "incorrect application" of the Guidelinesunder $ 3742(f )(1), we also agree with both Williams and theGovernment that, when a district court relies upon an improper ground in departing from the guideline range, a re-viewing court may not affirm a sentence based solely onits independent assessment that the departure is reason-able under $ 3742(f)(2). Section 3742(f) specifies two circum2 The dissent states that an error in interpreting a policy statement governing departures "is not, in itself, subject to appellate review." Post, at212. The dissent believes that all departure decisions must be reviewedunder the "reasonableness" standard of $ 3742(f)(2) and that the "reasonableness" determination includes an assessment of whether the districtcourt properly found an " `aggravating or mitigating circumstance . . . notadequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission informulating the guidelines.' " Post, at 218 (quoting 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(b)).But, in determining whether a circumstance was adequately taken intoconsideration, a court must consider "the sentencing guidelines, policystatements, and official commentary of the Sentencing Commission."$ 3553(b). Thus, the dissent would appear to agree that an appellate courtcan review the validity of a district court's reasons for departure for consistency with the Commission's policy statements; it simply considers thatinquiry to go to the "reasonableness" of the decision to depart rather thanto the correct application of the Guidelines.503us1$43D 11-13-95 22:53:53 PAGES OPINPGT202 WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtstances in which a court of appeals must remand for resen-tencing: if the sentence was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the Guidelines or if the sentence is anunreasonable departure from the applicable guideline range.The statute does not allow a court to focus on one remandprovision to the exclusion of the other.We do not believe that the dissent's contrary conclusion issupported by declarations from Congress and the SentencingCommission which state that departure sentences are reviewable under $ 3742(f)(2). Post, at 209-210, 212-213. Weare unable to find any indication in those statements thatdepartures from the Guidelines are to be reviewed exclusively under $ 3742(f )(2). Thus, we believe that, while departure decisions are properly reviewed under $ 3742(f)(2),they are also properly reviewed under $ 3742(f)(1) when theyare the result of an incorrect application of the Guidelines(considered in light of the relevant policy statements) thatgovern departure decisions. In order to give full effect toboth provisions, therefore, the reviewing court is obliged toconduct two separate inquiries. First, was the sentence imposed either in violation of law or as a result of an incorrectapplication of the Guidelines? If so, a remand is requiredunder $ 3742(f )(1). If the court concludes that the departureis not the result of an error in interpreting the Guidelines,it should proceed to the second step: is the resulting sentence an unreasonably high or low departure from the relevant guideline range? If so, a remand is required under$ 3742(f)(2).Williams argues further that whenever a court of appealsfinds that a district court considered an erroneous factorin sentencing, a remand is automatically required under$ 3742(f)(1) in order to rectify an "incorrect application" ofthe Guidelines. We disagree. Section 3742(f)(1) does notcall for a remand every time a sentencing court might misapply a provision of the Guidelines; rather, remand is requiredonly if the sentence was "imposed as a result of an incorrect503us1$43D 11-13-95 22:53:53 PAGES OPINPGT203Cite as: 503 U. S. 193 (1992)Opinion of the Courtapplication" of the Guidelines. When a district court hasnot intended to depart from the Guidelines, a sentence isimposed "as a result of " an incorrect application of theGuidelines when the error results in the district court selecting a sentence from the wrong guideline range. When a dis-trict court has intended to depart from the guideline range,a sentence is imposed "as a result of " a misapplication of theGuidelines if the sentence would have been different butfor the district court's error. Accordingly, in determiningwhether a remand is required under $ 3742(f )(1), a court ofappeals must decide whether the district court would haveimposed the same sentence had it not relied upon the invalidfactor or factors.We conclude that the party challenging the sentence onappeal, although it bears the initial burden of showing thatthe district court relied upon an invalid factor at sentencing,does not have the additional burden of proving that the in-valid factor was determinative in the sentencing decision.Rather, once the court of appeals has decided that the dis-trict court misapplied the Guidelines, a remand is appropriate unless the reviewing court concludes, on the record asa whole, that the error was harmless,i. e., that the error didnot affect the district court's selection of the sentence imposed. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(a).BIf the party defending the sentence persuades the court ofappeals that the district court would have imposed the samesentence absent the erroneous factor, then a remand is notrequired under $ 3742(f )(1), and the court of appeals may affirm the sentence as long as it is also satisfied that the depar-ture is reasonable under $ 3742(f)(2). The reasonablenessdetermination looks to the amount and extent of the depar-ture in light of the grounds for departing. In assessing reasonableness under $ 3742(f )(2), the Act directs a court of ap-peals to examine the factors to be considered in imposing a503us1$43D 11-13-95 22:53:53 PAGES OPINPGT204 WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtsentence under the Guidelines, as well as the district court'sstated reasons for the imposition of the particular sentence.$ 3742(e). A sentence thus can be "reasonable" even if someof the reasons given by the district court to justify the departure from the presumptive guideline range are invalid, pro-vided that the remaining reasons are sufficient to justify themagnitude of the departure.CThe dissent interprets the "reasonableness" standard of$ 3742(f)(2) to be the sole provision governing appellate review of departure decisions. The dissent also posits a two-step test of reasonableness: the appellate court must determine the reasonableness of the district court's decision todepart based on the court's stated reasons for departure,post, at 218, and the appellate court must determine the rea-sonableness of the amount or extent of departure,post, at218-220. This is similar to our two-step inquiry, see supra,at 201-202, for determining when a remand is required. Thedissent thus agrees that "[w]here all the reasons enunciatedby the district court to support departure are found to beinvalid," the appellate court "must set aside the sentence andremand the case," post, at 218, although it would find such aremand necessary because "the departure isper se unreason-able," ibid., and not because it was imposed "as a result of "an incorrect application of the Guidelines. When some butnot all of the district court's reasons for departure are invalid, however, the dissent's position requires the appellatecourt to consider whether the district court could have basedits departure on the remaining factors, post, at 219, and notwhether itwould still have chosen so to act, supra, at 203.In practical effect, therefore, the divergence of the dissent's interpretation of the statute from our own is in thedegree of an appellate court's authority to affirm a sentencewhen the district court, once made aware of the errors in itsinterpretation of the Guidelines, may have chosen a different503us1$43D 11-13-95 22:53:53 PAGES OPINPGT205Cite as: 503 U. S. 193 (1992)Opinion of the Courtsentence. Although the Act established a limited appellatereview of sentencing decisions, it did not alter a court ofappeals' traditional deference to a district court's exercise ofits sentencing discretion. The selection of the appropriatesentence from within the guideline range, as well as the decision to depart from the range in certain circumstances, aredecisions that are left solely to the sentencing court. USSG$ 5K2.0, p. s. The development of the guideline sentencingregime has not changed our view that, except to the extentspecifically directed by statute, "it is not the role of an appellate court to substitute its judgment for that of the sentencing court as to the appropriateness of a particular sentence."Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, 290, n. 16 (1983).Significantly, Congress amended the Act in 1986 to deletecertain provisions that authorized an appellate court to correct a sentence determined to have been imposed as a resultof an incorrect application of the Guidelines. See CriminalLaw and Procedure Technical Amendments Act of 1986, $ 73,100 Stat. 3617. That action confirms our belief that it is theprerogative of the district court, not the court of appeals, todetermine, in the first instance, the sentence that should beimposed in light of certain factors properly considered underthe Guidelines.IIIAAt oral argument in this Court, petitioner's counsel contended that both of the District Court's stated grounds fordeparture were invalid and therefore that Williams' sentencemust have resulted from an incorrect application of theGuidelines. Tr. of Oral Arg. 42-43. Counsel argued thatnot only was it improper for the District Court to rely uponWilliams' prior arrest record, but also that the Guidelinesprevented the court from considering convictions more than15 years old. Id., at 43. The Guidelines explicitly authorize503us1$43D 11-13-95 22:53:54 PAGES OPINPGT206 WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courta district court to base a departure on outdated convictionsthat are "evidence of similar misconduct," see USSG $ 4A1.2,comment., n. 8, but the Circuits are divided as to whether,by implication, they prohibit a departure based on nonsimilar outdated convictions. Compare, e. g., United States v.Aymelek, 926 F. 2d 64, 72-73 (CA1 1991) (nonsimilar out-dated convictions may be appropriate grounds for departure); United States v. Russell, 905 F. 2d 1439, 1444 (CA101990) (same), with United States v. Leake, 908 F. 2d 550, 554(CA9 1990) (upward departure can never be based on non-similar outdated convictions). In this case, the propriety ofthe District Court's consideration of Williams' nonsimilaroutdated convictions was not clearly presented in the petition for certiorari and was not briefed by either party. Ac-cordingly, we decline to review the Court of Appeals' determination that Williams' outdated convictions were reliableinformation that his criminal history category understatedthe extent of his criminal background. See 910 F. 2d, at1578-1579.BThe Court of Appeals was obliged to review, under bothremand provisions of $ 3742(f ), a departure from the guideline range in which it found one of the two stated groundsfor departure to be valid and the other to be invalid. Weare unable to ascertain from its opinion whether the Courtof Appeals concluded that the District Court would haveimposed the same sentence even without relying uponWilliams' prior arrest record, see $ 3742(f)(1), or whether itaffirmed simply on the basis that the sentence was reasonable under $ 3742(f )(2). We therefore vacate the judgmentbelow affirming Williams' sentence, and remand the case fora determination whether the sentence was imposed "as a result of " the District Court's erroneous consideration of hisprior arrests not resulting in prosecution.
