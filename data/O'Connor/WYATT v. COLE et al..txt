In Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922 (1982), weleft open the question whether private defendants chargedwith 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 liability for invoking state replevin,garnishment, and attachment statutes later declared unconstitutional are entitled to qualified immunity from suit. 457U. S., at 942, n. 23. We now hold that they are not.IThis dispute arises out of a soured cattle partnership. InJuly 1986, respondent Bill Cole sought to dissolve his partnership with petitioner Howard Wyatt. When no agree-ment could be reached, Cole, with the assistance of an504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT160 WYATT v. COLEOpinion of the Courtattorney, respondent John Robbins II, filed a state courtcomplaint in replevin against Wyatt, accompanied by a replevin bond of $18,000.At that time, Mississippi law provided that an individualcould obtain a court order for seizure of property possessedby another by posting a bond and swearing to a state courtthat the applicant was entitled to that property and that theadversary "wrongfully took and detain[ed] or wrongfully detain[ed]" the property. 1975 Miss. Gen. Laws, ch. 508, $ 1.The statute gave the judge no discretion to deny a writ ofreplevin.After Cole presented a complaint and bond, the court ordered the county sheriff to seize 24 head of cattle, a tractor,and certain other personal property from Wyatt. Severalmonths later, after a postseizure hearing, the court dismissedCole's complaint in replevin and ordered the property returned to Wyatt. When Cole refused to comply, Wyattbrought suit in Federal District Court, challenging the constitutionality of the statute and seeking injunctive relief anddamages from respondents, the county sheriff, and the deputies involved in the seizure.The District Court held that the statute's failure to affordjudges discretion to deny writs of replevin violated due process. 710 F. Supp. 180, 183 (SD Miss. 1989).1 It dismissedthe suit against the government officials involved in the seizure on the ground that they were entitled to qualified immunity. App. 17-18. The court also held that Cole and Robbins, even if otherwise liable under $ 1983, were entitled toqualified immunity from suit for conduct arising prior to thestatute's invalidation. Id., at 12-14. The Court of Appealsfor the Fifth Circuit affirmed the District Court's grant ofqualified immunity to the private defendants. 928 F. 2d718 (1991).1 The State amended the statute in 1990. Miss.

S. 807 (1991), to resolve aconflict among the Courts of Appeals over whether privatedefendants threatened with 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 liability are,like certain government officials, entitled to qualified immunity from suit. Like the Fifth Circuit, the Eighth and Elev-enth Circuits have determined that private defendants areentitled to qualified immunity. See Buller v. Buechler, 706F. 2d 844, 850-852 (CA8 1983);Jones v. Preuit & Mauldin,851 F. 2d 1321, 1323-1325 (CA11 1988) (en banc), vacated onother grounds, 489 U. S. 1002 (1989). The First and NinthCircuits, however, have held that in certain circumstances,private parties acting under color of state law are not enti-tled to such an immunity. SeeDowns v. Sawtelle, 574 F. 2d1, 15-16 (CA1), cert. denied, 439 U. S. 910 (1978); Conner v.Santa Ana, 897 F. 2d 1487, 1492, n. 9 (CA9), cert. denied, 498U. S. 816 (1990); Howerton v. Gabica, 708 F. 2d 380, 385, n. 10(CA9 1983). The Sixth Circuit has rejected qualified immu-nity for private defendants sued under $ 1983 but has established a good faith defense. Duncan v. Peck, 844 F. 2d1261 (1988).IITitle 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 provides a cause of action against"[e]very person who, under color of any statute . . . of anyState . . . subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen . . .to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunitiessecured by the Constitution and laws . . . ." The purpose of$ 1983 is to deter state actors from using the badge of theirauthority to deprive individuals of their federally guaranteedrights and to provide relief to victims if such deterrence fails.Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 254-257 (1978).InLugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., supra, the Court consid-ered the scope of $ 1983 liability in the context of garnishment, prejudgment attachment, and replevin statutes. Inthat case, the Court held that private parties who attacheda debtor's assets pursuant to a state attachment statute weresubject to $ 1983 liability if the statute was constitutionally504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT162 WYATT v. COLEOpinion of the Courtinfirm. Noting that our garnishment, prejudgment attachment, and replevin cases established that private use of statelaws to secure property could constitute "state action" forpurposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, id., at 932-935, theCourt held that private defendants invoking a state-createdattachment statute act "under color of state law" within themeaning of $ 1983 if their actions are "fairly attributable tothe State," id., at 937. This requirement is satisfied, theCourt held, if two conditions are met. First, the "deprivation must be caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the State or by a rule of conduct imposed bythe State or by a person for whom the State is responsible."Ibid. Second, the private party must have "acted togetherwith or . . . obtained significant aid from state officials" orengaged in conduct "otherwise chargeable to the State."Ibid. The Court found potential $ 1983 liability in Lugar because the attachment scheme was created by the State andbecause the private defendants, in invoking the aid of stateofficials to attach the disputed property, were "willful participant[s] in joint activity with the State or its agents." Id.,at 941 (internal quotation marks omitted).Citing Lugar, the District Court assumed that Cole, byinvoking the state statute, had acted under color of state lawwithin the meaning of $ 1983, and was therefore liable fordamages for the deprivation of Wyatt's due process rights.App. 12. With respect to Robbins, the court noted thatwhile an action taken by an attorney in representing a client"does not normally constitute an act under color of state law,. . . an attorney is still a person who may conspire to actunder color of state law in depriving another of securedrights." Id., at 13. The court did not determine whetherRobbins was liable, however, because it held that both Coleand Robbins were entitled to qualified immunity from suitat least for conduct prior to the statute's invalidation. Id.,at 13-14.504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT163Cite as: 504 U. S. 158 (1992)Opinion of the CourtAlthough the Court of Appeals did not review whether, inthe first instance, Cole and Robbins had acted under color ofstate law within the meaning of $ 1983, it affirmed the Dis-trict Court's grant of qualified immunity to respondents. Inso doing, the Court of Appeals followed one of its prior cases,Folsom Investment Co. v. Moore, 681 F. 2d 1032 (CA5 1982),in which it held that "a $ 1983 defendant who has invoked anattachment statute is entitled to an immunity from monetaryliability so long as he neither knew nor reasonably shouldhave known that the statute was unconstitutional." Id., at1037. The court in Folsom based its holding on twogrounds. First, it viewed the existence of a common law,probable cause defense to the torts of malicious prosecutionand wrongful attachment as evidence that "Congress in en-acting $ 1983 could not have intended to subject to liabilitythose who in good faith resorted to legal process." Id., at1038. Although it acknowledged that a defense is not thesame as an immunity, the court maintained that it could"transfor[m] a common law defense extant at the time of$ 1983's passage into an immunity." Ibid. Second, thecourt held that while immunity for private parties is not derived from official immunity, it is based on "the importantpublic interest in permitting ordinary citizens to rely on presumptively valid state laws, in shielding citizens from mone-tary damages when they reasonably resort to a legal processlater held to be unconstitutional, and in protecting a privatecitizen from liability when his role in any unconstitutionalaction is marginal." Id., at 1037. In defending the decisionbelow, respondents advance both arguments put forward bythe Court of Appeals in Folsom. Neither is availing.IIISection 1983 "creates a species of tort liability that on itsface admits of no immunities." Imbler v. Pachtman, 424U. S. 409, 417 (1976). Nonetheless, we have accorded cer-tain government officials either absolute or qualified immu504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT164 WYATT v. COLEOpinion of the Courtnity from suit if the "tradition of immunity was so firmlyrooted in the common law and was supported by such strongpolicy reasons that `Congress would have specifically so pro-vided had it wished to abolish the doctrine.' "Owen v. Cityof Independence, 445 U. S. 622, 637 (1980) (quoting Piersonv. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 555 (1967)). If parties seeking immu-nity were shielded from tort liability when Congress enactedthe Civil Rights Act of 1871--$ 1 of which is codified at 42U. S. C. $ 1983--we infer from legislative silence that Congress did not intend to abrogate such immunities when itimposed liability for actions taken under color of state law.See Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S. 914, 920 (1984); Imbler, supra,at 421; Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U. S. 522, 529 (1984). Additionally, irrespective of the common law support, we will notrecognize an immunity available at common law if $ 1983'shistory or purpose counsel against applying it in $ 1983actions. Tower, supra, at 920. See also Imbler, supra, at424-429.In determining whether there was an immunity at common law that Congress intended to incorporate in the CivilRights Act, we look to the most closely analogous torts--inthis case, malicious prosecution and abuse of process. Atcommon law, these torts provided causes of action againstprivate defendants for unjustified harm arising out of themisuse of governmental processes. 2 C. Addison, Law ofTorts || 852, and n. 2, || 868, and n. 1 (1876); T. Cooley, Lawof Torts 187-190 (1879); J. Bishop, Commentaries on NonContract Law $$ 228-250, pp. 91-103, $ 490, p. 218 (1889).Respondents do not contend that private parties who instituted attachment proceedings and who were subsequentlysued for malicious prosecution or abuse of process were entitled to absolute immunity. And with good reason; althoughpublic prosecutors and judges were accorded absolute immunity at common law, Imbler v. Pachtman, supra, at 421-424,such protection did not extend to complaining witnesses who,like respondents, set the wheels of government in motion by504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT165Cite as: 504 U. S. 158 (1992)Opinion of the Courtinstigating a legal action. Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335,340-341 (1986) ("In 1871, the generally accepted rule wasthat one who procured the issuance of an arrest warrant bysubmitting a complaint could be held liable if the complaintwas made maliciously and without probable cause").Nonetheless, respondents argue that at common law, pri-vate defendants could defeat a malicious prosecution orabuse of process action if they acted without malice and withprobable cause, and that we should therefore infer that Congress did not intend to abrogate such defenses when it en-acted the Civil Rights Act of 1871. We adopted similar reasoning in Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S., at 555-557. There, weheld that police officers sued for false arrest under $ 1983were entitled to the defense that they acted with probablecause and in good faith when making an arrest under a statute they reasonably believed was valid. We recognized thisdefense because peace officers were accorded protection fromliability at common law if they arrested an individual in goodfaith, even if the innocence of such person were later established. Ibid.The rationale we adopted in Pierson is of no avail to respondents here. Even if there were sufficient common lawsupport to conclude that respondents, like the police officersin Pierson, should be entitled to a good faith defense, thatwould still not entitle them to what they sought and obtainedin the courts below: the qualified immunity from suit accorded government officials under Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457U. S. 800 (1982).In Harlow, we altered the standard of qualified immunityadopted in our prior $ 1983 cases because we recognized that"[t]he subjective element of the good-faith defense frequently[had] prove[d] incompatible with our admonition . . . thatinsubstantial claims should not proceed to trial." Id., at815-816. Because of the attendant harms to government effectiveness caused by lengthy judicial inquiry into subjectivemotivation, we concluded that "bare allegations of malice504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT166 WYATT v. COLEOpinion of the Courtshould not suffice to subject government officials either tothe costs of trial or to the burdens of broad-reaching discovery." Id., at 817-818. Accordingly, we held that gov-ernment officials performing discretionary functions areshielded from "liability for civil damages insofar as their con-duct [did] not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would haveknown."Id., at 818. This wholly objective standard, weconcluded, would "avoid excessive disruption of governmentand permit the resolution of many insubstantial claims onsummary judgment." Ibid.That Harlow "completely reformulated qualified immunityalong principles not at all embodied in the common law,"An-derson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 645 (1987), was reinforcedby our decision in Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511 (1985).Mitchell held that Harlow established an "immunity fromsuit rather than a mere defense to liability," which, like anabsolute immunity, "is effectively lost if a case is erroneouslypermitted to go to trial." 472 U. S., at 526 (emphasis sup-plied). Thus, we held inMitchell that the denial of qualifiedimmunity should be immediately appealable. Id., at 530.It is this type of objectively determined, immediately ap-pealable immunity that respondents asserted below.2 But,2 In arguing that respondents are entitled to qualified immunity underHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800 (1982), the dissent mixes apples andoranges. Even if we were to agree with the dissent's proposition thatelements a plaintiff was required to prove as part of her case in chief couldsomehow be construed as a " `defense,' " post, at 176, n. 1, and that this"defense" entitles private citizens to some protection from liability, wecannot agree that respondents are entitled to immunity from suit underHarlow. One could reasonably infer from the fact that a plaintiff's malicious prosecution or abuse of process action failed if she could not affirmatively establish both malice and want of probable cause that plaintiffsbringing an analogous suit under $ 1983 should be required to make asimilar showing to sustain a $ 1983 cause of action. Alternatively, if oneaccepts the dissent's characterization of the common law as establishingan affirmative "defense" for private defendants, then one could also conclude that private parties sued under $ 1983 should likewise be entitled to504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT167Cite as: 504 U. S. 158 (1992)Opinion of the Courtas our precedents make clear, the reasons for recognizingsuch an immunity were based not simply on the existence ofa good faith defense at common law, but on the special policyconcerns involved in suing government officials.Harlow,supra, at 813; Mitchell, supra, at 526. Reviewing these concerns, we conclude that the rationales mandating qualifiedimmunity for public officials are not applicable to privateparties.Qualified immunity strikes a balance between compensating those who have been injured by official conduct andprotecting government's ability to perform its traditionalfunctions. Harlow, supra, at 819; Pierson, supra, at 554;Anderson, supra, at 638. Accordingly, we have recognizedqualified immunity for government officials where it was necessary to preserve their ability to serve the public good orto ensure that talented candidates were not deterred by thethreat of damages suits from entering public service. See,e. g., Wood v. Strickland, 420 U. S. 308, 319 (1975) (denial ofqualified immunity to school board officials " `would contribute not to principled and fearless decision-making but to intimidation' ") (quoting Pierson, supra, at 554); Butz v. Economou, 438 U. S. 478, 506 (1978) (immunity for Presidentialaides warranted partly "to protect officials who are requiredto exercise their discretion and the related public interestin encouraging the vigorous exercise of official authority");Mitchell, supra, at 526 (immunity designed to prevent the" `distraction of officials from their governmental duties, inhibition of discretionary action, and deterrence of able peoplefrom public service' " (quoting Harlow, supra, at 816)). Inassert an affirmative defense based on a similar showing of good faith and/or probable cause. In neither case, however, is it appropriate to makethe dissent's leap: that because these common law torts partially includedan objective component--probable cause--private defendants sued under$ 1983 should be entitled to the objectively determined, immediatelyappealable immunity from suit accorded certain government officialsunder Harlow.504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT168 WYATT v. COLEOpinion of the Courtshort, the qualified immunity recognized in Harlow acts tosafeguard government, and thereby to protect the public atlarge, not to benefit its agents.These rationales are not transferable to private parties.Although principles of equality and fairness may suggest, asrespondents argue, that private citizens who rely unsus-pectingly on state laws they did not create and may have noreason to believe are invalid should have some protectionfrom liability, as do their government counterparts, such interests are not sufficiently similar to the traditional purposesof qualified immunity to justify such an expansion. Unlikeschool board members, see Wood, supra, or police officers,see Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335 (1986), or Presidentialaides, see Butz, supra, private parties hold no office requiring them to exercise discretion; nor are they principally concerned with enhancing the public good. Accordingly, extending Harlow qualified immunity to private parties wouldhave no bearing on whether public officials are able to actforcefully and decisively in their jobs or on whether qualified applicants enter public service. Moreover, unlike withgovernment officials performing discretionary functions, thepublic interest will not be unduly impaired if private individuals are required to proceed to trial to resolve their legaldisputes. In short, the nexus between private parties andthe historic purposes of qualified immunity is simply tooattenuated to justify such an extension of our doctrine ofimmunity.For these reasons, we can offer no relief today. The question on which we granted certiorari is a very narrow one:"[W]hether private persons, who conspire with state officialsto violate constitutional rights, have available the good faithimmunity applicable to public officials." Pet. for Cert. i.The precise issue encompassed in this question, and the onlyissue decided by the lower courts, is whether qualified immunity, as enunciated in Harlow, is available for private defendants faced with $ 1983 liability for invoking a state replevin,504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT169Cite as: 504 U. S. 158 (1992)Kennedy, J., concurringgarnishment, or attachment statute. That answer is no. Inso holding, however, we do not foreclose the possibility thatprivate defendants faced with $ 1983 liability under Lugar v.Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922 (1982), could be entitled toan affirmative defense based on good faith and/or probablecause or that $ 1983 suits against private, rather than governmental, parties could require plaintiffs to carry additionalburdens. Because those issues are not fairly before us, however, we leave them for another day. Cf. Yee v. Escondido,503 U. S., 519, 534-538 (1992).IVAs indicated above, the District Court assumed that underLugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., supra, Cole was liable under$ 1983 for invoking the state replevin under bond statute,and intimated that, but did not decide whether, Robbins alsowas subject to $ 1983 liability. The Court of Appeals neverrevisited this question, but instead concluded only that respondents were entitled to qualified immunity at least forconduct prior to the statute's invalidation. Because weoverturn this judgment, we must remand, since there re-mains to be determined, at least, whether Cole and Robbins,in invoking the replevin statute, acted under color of statelaw within the meaning ofLugar. The judgment of theCourt of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded forproceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Scalia joins,concurring.I join the opinion of the Court but find that a further andseparate statement of my views is required.I agree with what The Chief Justice writes in dissentrespecting the historical origins of our qualified immunityjurisprudence but submit that the question presented to usrequires that we reverse the judgment, as the majorityholds. Indeed, the result reached by the Court is quite con504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT170 WYATT v. COLEKennedy, J., concurringsistent, in my view, with a proper application of the historyThe Chief Justice relates.Both the Court and the dissent recognize that our originaldecisions recognizing defenses and immunities to suitsbrought under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 rely on analogous limitationsexisting in the common law when $ 1983 was enacted. Seeante, at 163-164; post, at 176-177. In Tenney v. Brandhove,341 U. S. 367, 376 (1951), we held that $ 1983 had not eradi-cated the absolute immunity granted legislators under thecommon law. And in Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 555-557(1967), we recognized that under $ 1983 police officers suedfor false arrest had available what we described as a "defense of good faith and probable cause," based on their reasonable belief that the statute under which they acted wasconstitutional. Id., at 557. Pierson allowed the defensebecause with respect to the analogous common-law tort,the Court decided that officers had available to them asimilar defense. The good-faith and probable-cause defenseevolved into our modern qualified-immunity doctrine. Ante,at 165-166.Our immunity doctrine is rooted in historical analogy,based on the existence of common-law rules in 1871, ratherthan in "freewheeling policy choice[s]." Malley v. Briggs,475 U. S. 335, 342 (1986). In cases involving absolute immunity we adhere to that view, granting immunity to the extentconsistent with historical practice. Ibid.; Burns v. Reed, 500U. S. 478, 485 (1991); Hafer v. Melo, 502 U. S. 21, 28-29 (1991).In the context of qualified immunity for public officials, however, we have diverged to a substantial degree from the historical standards. In Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800(1982), we "completely reformulated qualified immunityalong principles not at all embodied in the common law,replacing the inquiry into subjective malice so frequentlyrequired at common law with an objective inquiry into thelegal reasonableness of the official action." Anderson v.Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 645 (1987). The transformation504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT171Cite as: 504 U. S. 158 (1992)Kennedy, J., concurringwas justified by the special policy concerns arising from pub-lic officials' exposure to repeated suits.Harlow, supra, at813-814; ante, at 165-166. The dissent in today's case ar-gues that similar considerations justify a transformation ofcommon-law standards in the context of private-party defendants. Post, at 179-180. With this I cannot agree.We need not decide whether or not it was appropriate forthe Court in Harlow to depart from history in the name ofpublic policy, reshaping immunity doctrines in light of thosepolicy considerations. But I would not extend that approachto other contexts.Harlow was decided at a time when thestandards applicable to summary judgment made it difficultfor a defendant to secure summary judgment regarding afactual question such as subjective intent, even when theplaintiff bore the burden of proof on the question; and inHarlow we relied on that fact in adopting an objective standard for qualified immunity. 457 U. S., at 815-819. However, subsequent clarifications to summary-judgment lawhave alleviated that problem, by allowing summary judgment to be entered against a nonmoving party "who fails tomake a showing sufficient to establish the existence of anelement essential to that party's case, and on which thatparty will bear the burden of proof at trial." Celotex Corp.v. Catrett, 477 U. S. 317, 322 (1986). Under the principlesset forth in Celotex and related cases, the strength of factualallegations such as subjective bad faith can be tested at thesummary-judgment stage.It must be remembered that unlike the common-lawjudges whose doctrines we adopt, we are devising limitationsto a remedial statute, enacted by the Congress, which "on itsface does not provide for any immunities." Malley, supra,at 342 (emphasis in original). We have imported commonlaw doctrines in the past because of our conclusion that theCongress which enacted $ 1983 acted in light of existing legalprinciples. Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U. S. 622,637-638 (1980). That suggests, however, that we may not504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT172 WYATT v. COLEKennedy, J., concurringtransform what existed at common law based on our notionsof policy or efficiency.My conclusions are a mere consequence of the historicalprinciples described in the dissent ofThe Chief Justice.The common-law tort actions most analogous to the actioncommenced here were malicious prosecution and abuse ofprocess.Post, at 176. In both of the common-law actions,it was essential for the plaintiff to prove that the wrongdoeracted with malice and without probable cause.Post, at 176,n. 1. As The Chief Justice states, it is something of amisnomer to describe the common law as creating a goodfaith defense; we are in fact concerned with the essence ofthe wrong itself, with the essential elements of the tort.The malice element required the plaintiff to show that thechallenged action was undertaken with an unlawful purpose,though it did not require a showing of ill will towards theplaintiff. J. Bishop, Commentaries on Non-Contract Law$ 232, p. 92 (1889). To establish the absence of probablecause, a plaintiff was required to prove that a reasonableperson, knowing what the defendant did, would not have believed that the prosecution or suit was well grounded, or thatthe defendant had in fact acted with the belief that the suitor prosecution in question was without probable cause. Id.,$ 239, at 95. Our cases on the subject, beginning with Harlow v. Fitzgerald, diverge from the common law in two ways.First, as The Chief Justice acknowledges, modern qualified immunity does not turn upon the subjective belief ofthe defendant. Post, at 178, n. 2. Second, the immunitydiverges from the common-law model by requiring the defendant, not the plaintiff, to bear the burden of proof on theprobable-cause issue. Supra this page.The decision to impose these requirements under a ruleof immunity has implications, though, well beyond a meredetermination that one party or the other is in a better position to bear the burden of proof. It implicates as well thelaw's definition of the wrong itself. At common law the ac504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT173Cite as: 504 U. S. 158 (1992)Kennedy, J., concurringtion lay because the essence of the wrong was an injurycaused by a suit or prosecution commenced without probablecause or with knowledge that it was baseless. To cast theissue in terms of immunity, however, is to imply that a wrongwas committed but that it cannot be redressed. The difference is fundamental, for at stake is the concept of what soci-ety considers proper conduct and what it does not. Beneaththe nomenclature lie considerations of substance.Harlow was cast as an immunity case, involving as it didsuit against officers of the Government. And immunity, asdistinct, say, from a defense on the merits or an element ofthe plaintiff 's cause of action, is a legal inquiry, decided bythe court rather than a jury, and on which an interlocutoryappeal is available to defendants. Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472U. S. 511 (1985). Whether or not it is correct to diverge inthese respects from the common-law model when governmental agents are the defendants, we ought not to adopt anautomatic rule that the same analysis applies in suits againstprivate persons. See ante, at 166-167, n. 2. By casting therule as an immunity, we imply the underlying conduct wasunlawful, a most debatable proposition in a case where aprivate citizen may have acted in good-faith reliance upona statute. And as we have defined the immunity, we alsoeliminate from the case any demonstration of subjective goodfaith. Under the common law, however, if the plaintiff couldprove subjective bad faith on the part of the defendant, hehad gone far towards proving both malice and lack of probable cause. Moreover, the question of the defendant's beliefswas almost always one for the jury. Stewart v. Sonneborn,98 U. S. 187, 194 (1879).It is true that good faith may be difficult to establish inthe face of a showing that from an objective standpoint noreasonable person could have acted as the defendant did, andin many cases the result would be the same under eithertest. This is why Stewart describes the instances where theprobable cause turns on subjective intent as the exceptional504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT174 WYATT v. COLEKennedy, J., concurringcase. Ibid.; post, at 178, n. 2. That does not mean, how-ever, that we may deprive plaintiffs of the opportunity tomake their case. In some cases eliminating the defensebased on subjective good faith can make a real difference,and again the instant case of alleged reliance on a statutedeemed valid provides the example. It seems problematicto say that a defendant should be relieved of liability undersome automatic rule of immunity if objective reliance upon astatute is reasonable but the defendant in fact had knowledge of its invalidity. Because the burden of proof on thisquestion is the plaintiff 's, the question may be resolved onsummary judgment if the plaintiff cannot come forward withfacts from which bad faith can be inferred. But the questionis a factual one, and a plaintiff may rely on circumstantialrather than direct evidence to make his case. Siegert v.Gilley, 500 U. S. 226, 236 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring injudgment). The rule, of course, also works in reverse, forthe existence of a statute thought valid ought to allow a defendant to argue that he acted in subjective good faith and isentitled to exoneration no matter what the objective test is.The distinction I draw is important because there is support in the common law for the proposition that a privateindividual's reliance on a statute, prior to a judicial determination of unconstitutionality, is considered reasonable as amatter of law; and therefore under the circumstances of thiscase, lack of probable cause can only be shown through proofof subjective bad faith. Birdsall v. Smith, 158 Mich. 390,394, 122 N. W. 626, 627 (1909). Thus the subjective elementdismissed as exceptional by the dissent may be the rulerather than the exception.I join the opinion of the Court because I believe there isnothing contrary to what I say in that opinion. See ante,at 169 ("[W]e do not foreclose the possibility that privatedefendants faced with $ 1983 liability . . . could be entitled toan affirmative defense based on good faith and/or probablecause or that $ 1983 suits against private . . . parties could504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT175Cite as: 504 U. S. 158 (1992)Rehnquist, C. J., dissentingrequire plaintiffs to carry additional burdens"). Thoughthey described the issue before them as "good-faith immunity," both the District Court and the Court of Appealstreated the question as one of law. App. 12-14; 928 F. 2d718, 721-722 (CA5 1991). The Court of Appeals in particularplaced heavy reliance on the policy considerations favoring arule that citizens may rely on statutes presumed to be valid.Ibid. The latter inquiry, as Birdsall recognizes, however,goes mainly to the question of objective reasonableness. Ido not understand either the District Court or the Court ofAppeals to make an unequivocal finding that the respondentsbefore us acted with subjective good faith when they filedsuit under the Mississippi replevin statute. Furthermore,the question on which we granted certiorari was the narrowone whether private defendants in $ 1983 suits are entitledto the same qualified immunity applicable to public officials,ante, at 168, which of course would be subject to the objective standard of Harlow v. Fitzgerald. Under my view theanswer to that question is no. Though it might later be determined that there is no triable issue of fact to save theplaintiff 's case in the matter now before us, on remand itought to be open to him at least in theory to argue that thedefendants' bad faith eliminates any reliance on the statute,just as it ought to be open to the defendants to show goodfaith even if some construct of a reasonable person in thedefendants' position would have acted in a different way.So I agree the case must be remanded for furtherproceedings.Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Souterand Justice Thomas join, dissenting.The Court notes that we have recognized an immunity inthe $ 1983 context in two circumstances. The first is whena similarly situated defendant would have enjoyed an immunity at common law at the time $ 1983 was adopted. Ante,at 163-164. The second is when important public policy con504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT176 WYATT v. COLERehnquist, C. J., dissentingcerns suggest the need for an immunity. Ante, at 166-167.Because I believe that both requirements, as explained inour prior decisions, are satisfied here, I dissent.First, I think it is clear that at the time $ 1983 wasadopted, there generally was available to private parties agood-faith defense to the torts of malicious prosecution andabuse of process.1 See authorities cited ante, at 164; Malleyv.Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 340-341 (1986) (noting that the gen-erally accepted rule at common law was that a person wouldbe held liable if "the complaint was made maliciously andwithout probable cause"); Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 555(1967) (noting that at common law a police officer sued forfalse arrest can rely on his own good faith in making thearrest). And while the Court is willing to assume as much,ante, at 165, it thinks this insufficient to sustain respondents'claim to an immunity because the "qualified immunity" respondents' seek is not equivalent to such a "defense," ante,at 165-166.But I think the Court errs in suggesting that the availabil-ity of a good-faith common-law defense at the time of $ 1983'sadoption is not sufficient to support their claim to immunity.The case on which respondents principally rely,Pierson, con-sidered whether a police officer sued under $ 1983 for falsearrest could rely on a showing of good faith in order to es-cape liability. And while this Court concluded that the officer could rely on his own good faith, based in large part onthe fact that a good-faith defense had been available at common law, the Court was at best ambiguous as to whether it1 Describing the common law as providing a "defense" is something of amisnomer--under the common law it was plaintiff's burden to establish aselements of the tort both that the defendant acted with malice and withoutprobable cause. T. Cooley, Law of Torts 184-185 (1879); J. Bishop, Commentaries on Non-Contract Law $ 225, p. 90 (1889). Referring to the defendant as having a good-faith defense is a useful shorthand for capturingplaintiff's burden and the related notion that a defendant could avoid liability by establishing either a lack of malice or the presence of probablecause.504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT177Cite as: 504 U. S. 158 (1992)Rehnquist, C. J., dissentingwas recognizing a "defense" or an "immunity." Compare386 U. S., at 556 (criticizing Court of Appeals for concludingthat no "immunity" was available), with id., at 557 (recogniz-ing a good-faith "defense"). Any initial ambiguity, however,has certainly been eliminated by subsequent cases; there canbe no doubt that it is a qualified immunity to which the offi-cer is entitled. SeeMalley, supra, at 340. Similarly, inWood v. Strickland, 420 U. S. 308, 318 (1975), we recognizedthat, "[a]lthough there have been differing emphases and formulations of the common-law immunity," the general recog-nition under state law that public officers are entitled to agood-faith defense was sufficient to support the recognitionof a $ 1983 immunity.Thus, unlike the Court, I think our prior precedent establishes that a demonstration that a good-faith defense wasavailable at the time $ 1983 was adopted does, in fact, providesubstantial support for a contemporary defendant claimingthat he is entitled to qualified immunity in the analogous$ 1983 context. While we refuse to recognize a common-lawimmunity if $ 1983's history or purpose counsel against applying it, ante, at 164, I see no such history or purpose thatwould so counsel here.Indeed, I am at a loss to understand what is accomplishedby today's decision--other than a needlessly fastidious adherence to nomenclature--given that the Court acknowledges that a good-faith defense will be available for respondents to assert on remand. Respondents presumably will berequired to show the traditional elements of a good-faithdefense--either that they acted without malice or thatthey acted with probable cause. See n. 1, supra; Stewartv. Sonneborn, 98 U. S. 187, 194 (1879); W. Prosser, Law ofTorts $ 120, p. 854 (4th ed. 1971). The first element, "maliciousness," encompasses an inquiry into subjective intentfor bringing the suit. Stewart, supra, at 192-193; Prosser,supra, $ 120, at 855. This quite often includes an inquiryinto the defendant's subjective belief as to whether he be504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT178 WYATT v. COLERehnquist, C. J., dissentinglieved success was likely. See, e. g., 2 C. Addison, Law ofTorts || 854 (1876) ("Proof of the absence of belief in the truthof the charge by the person making it . . . is almost alwaysinvolved in the proof of malice"). But the second element,"probable cause," focuses principally on objective reasonable-ness.Stewart, supra, at 194; Prosser, supra, $ 120, at 854.Thus, respondents can successfully defend this suit simplyby establishing that their reliance on the replevin statutewas objectively reasonable for someone with their knowledgeof the circumstances. But this is precisely the showing thatentitles a public official to immunity. Harlow v. Fitzgerald,457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982) (official must show his action did not"violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rightsof which a reasonable person would have known").2Nor do I see any reason that this "defense" may not beasserted early in the proceedings on a motion for summaryjudgment, just as a claim to qualified immunity may be. Provided that the historical facts are not in dispute, the presenceor absence of "probable cause" has long been acknowledgedto be a question of law.Stewart, supra, at 193-194; 2 Addison, supra, || 853, n. (p); J. Bishop, Commentaries on Non-Contract Law $ 240, p. 95 (1889). And so I see no reasonthat the trial judge may not resolve a summary judgmentmotion premised on such a good-faith defense, just as wehave encouraged trial judges to do with respect to qualified2 There is perhaps one small difference between the historic commonlaw inquiry and the modern qualified immunity inquiry. At common law,a plaintiff can show the lack of probable cause either by showing that theactual facts did not amount to probable cause (an objective inquiry) or byshowing that the defendant lacked a sincere belief that probable causeexisted (a subjective inquiry). Bishop, Commentaries on Non-ContractLaw $ 239, at 95. But relying on the subjective belief, rather than on anobjective lack of probable cause, is clearly exceptional. See Stewart v.Sonneborn, 98 U. S. 187, 194 (1879) (describing subjective basis for findinglack of probable cause as exception to general rule). I see no reason tobase our decision whether to extend a contemporary, objectively basedqualified immunity on the exceptional common-law case.504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT179Cite as: 504 U. S. 158 (1992)Rehnquist, C. J., dissentingimmunity claims. Harlow, supra, at 818. Thus, private de-fendants who have invoked a state attachment law are putin the same position whether we recognize that they are enti-tled to qualified immunity or if we instead recognize a goodfaith defense. Perhaps the Court believes that the "defense" will be less amenable to summary disposition than willthe "immunity"; perhaps it believes the defense will be anissue that must be submitted to the jury, see ante, at 168(referring to cases such as this "proceed[ing] to trial").While I can see no reason why this would be so (given thatprobable cause is a legal question), if it is true, today's decision will only manage to increase litigation costs needlesslyfor hapless defendants.This, in turn, leads to the second basis on which we havepreviously recognized a qualified immunity--reasons of public policy. Assuming that some practical difference will result from recognizing a defense but not an immunity, I thinksuch a step is neither dictated by our prior decisions nordesirable. It is true, as the Court points out, that in abandoning a strictly historical approach to $ 1983 immunities wehave often explained our decision to recognize an immunityin terms of the special needs of public officials. But thosecases simply do not answer--because the question was notat issue--whether similar (or even completely unrelated) reasons of public policy would warrant immunity for privateparties as well.I believe there are such reasons. The normal presumption that attaches to any law is that society will be benefitedif private parties rely on that law to provide them a remedy,rather than turning to some form of private, and perhapslawless, relief. In denying immunity to those who reasonably rely on presumptively valid state law, and thereby discouraging such reliance, the Court expresses confidence thattoday's decision will not "unduly impai[r]," ibid., the publicinterest. I do not share that confidence. I would havethought it beyond peradventure that there is strong public504us1$71J 04-04-96 21:04:00 PAGES OPINPGT180 WYATT v. COLERehnquist, C. J., dissentinginterest in encouraging private citizens to rely on valid statelaws of which they have no reason to doubt the validity. Buller v. Buechler, 706 F. 2d 844, 851 (CA8 1983); Folsom Invest-ment Co. v. Moore, 681 F. 2d 1032, 1037-1038 (CA5 1982).Second, as with the police officer making an arrest, I be-lieve the private plaintiff 's lot is "not so unhappy" that hemust forgo recovery of property he believes to be properlyrecoverable through available legal processes or to be"mulcted in damages," Pierson, 386 U. S., at 555, if his beliefturns out to be mistaken. For as one Court of Appeals haspointed out, it is at least passing strange to conclude thatprivate individuals are acting "under color of law" becausethey invoke a state garnishment statute and the aid of stateofficers, see Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922(1982), but yet deny them the immunity to which those samestate officers are entitled, simply because the private partiesare not state employees. Buller, supra, at 851. Whilesome of the strangeness may be laid at the doorstep of ourdecision in Lugar, see 457 U. S., at 943 (Burger, C. J., dissent-ing); andid., at 944-956 (Powell, J., dissenting), there is noreason to proceed still further down this path. Our $ 1983jurisprudence has gone very far afield indeed, when it sub-jects private parties to greater risk than their public counterparts, despite the fact that $ 1983's historic purpose was"to prevent state officials from using the cloak of their authority under state law to violate rights protected againststate infringement."Id., at 948 (emphasis added). See alsoMonroe v. Pape, 365 U.

UNITED STATEScertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuitNo. 91-5771. Argued March 23, 1992--Decided May 18, 1992After his arrest on, inter alia, federal drug charges, petitioner Wade gavelaw enforcement officials information that led them to arrest anotherdrug dealer. Subsequently, he pleaded guilty to the charges, and theDistrict Court sentenced him to the 10-year minimum sentence requiredby 21 U. S. C. $ 841(b)(1)(B) and the United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (USSG). The court refused Wade's requestthat his sentence be reduced below the minimum to reward him forhis substantial assistance to the Government, holding that 18 U. S. C.$ 3553(e) and USSG $ 5K1.1 empower the district courts to make such areduction only if the Government files a motion requesting the departure. The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting Wade's arguments thatthe District Court erred in holding that the absence of a Governmentmotion deprived it of the authority to reduce his sentence and that thelower court was authorized to enquire into the Government's motivesfor failing to file a motion.Held:1. Federal district courts have the authority to review the Government's refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion and to grant a remedy if they find that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive.Since the parties assume that the statutory and Guidelines provisionspose identical and equally burdensome obstacles, this Court is not required to decide whether $ 5K1.1 "implements" and thereby supersedes$ 3553(e) or whether the provisions pose separate obstacles. In bothprovisions, the condition limiting the court's authority gives the Government a power, not a duty, to file a substantial-assistance motion. Nonetheless, a prosecutor's discretion when exercising that power is subjectto constitutional limitations that district courts can enforce. Thus, adefendant would be entitled to relief if the prosecution refused to file amotion for a suspect reason such as the defendant's race or religion.However, neither a claim that a defendant merely provided substantialassistance nor additional but generalized allegations of improper motivewill entitle a defendant to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing. A defendant has a right to the latter proceduresonly if he makes a substantial threshold showing of improper motive.Pp. 184-186.504us1$72z 04-04-96 21:08:22 PAGES OPINPGT182 WADE v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court2. Wade has failed to raise a claim of improper motive. He has neveralleged or pointed to evidence tending to show that the Governmentrefused to file a motion for suspect reasons. And he argues to no availthat, because the District Court erroneously believed that no impermissible motive charge could state a claim for relief, it thwarted his attemptto show that the Government violated his constitutional rights by withholding the motion arbitrarily or in bad faith. While Wade would beentitled to relief if the prosecutor's refusal to move was not rationallyrelated to any legitimate Government end, the record here shows nosupport for his claim of frustration, and the claim as presented to theDistrict Court failed to rise to the level warranting judicial enquiry. Inresponse to the court's invitation to state what evidence he would introduce to support his claim, Wade merely explained the extent of his assistance to the Government. This is a necessary, but not a sufficient,condition for relief, because the Government's decision not to move mayhave been based simply on its rational assessment of the cost and benefitthat would flow from moving. Pp. 186-187.936 F. 2d 169, affirmed.Souter, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.J. Matthew Martin, by appointment of the Court, 502 U. S.1028, argued the cause for petitioner.

S. 181 (1992)Opinion of the Courtdistrict courts to go below the minimum required under theGuidelines if the Government files a "substantial assistance"motion. This case presents the question whether districtcourts may subject the Government's refusal to file such amotion to review for constitutional violations. We hold thatthey may, but that the petitioner has raised no claim tosuch review.On October 30, 1989, police searched the house of thepetitioner, Harold Ray Wade, Jr., discovered 978 grams ofcocaine, two handguns, and more than $22,000 in cash, andarrested Wade. In the aftermath of the search, Wade gavelaw enforcement officials information that led them to arrestanother drug dealer. In due course, a federal grand juryindicted Wade for distributing cocaine and possessing cocaine with intent to distribute it, both in violation of 21U. S. C. $ 841(a)(1); for conspiring to do these things, in violation of $ 846; and for using or carrying a firearm during,and in relation to, a drug crime, in violation of 18 U. S. C.$ 924(c)(1). Wade pleaded guilty to all four counts.The presentence report put the sentencing range underthe Guidelines for the drug offenses at 97 to 121 months, butadded that Wade was subject to a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence, 21 U. S. C. $ 841(b)(1)(B), narrowing theactual range to 120 to 121 months, see USSG $ 5G1.1(c)(2).The report also stated that both USSG $ 2K2.4(a) and 18U. S. C. $ 924(c) required a 5-year sentence on the gun count.At the sentencing hearing in the District Court, Wade's lawyer urged the court to impose a sentence below the 10-yearminimum for the drug counts to reward Wade for his assistance to the Government. The court responded that the Government had filed no motion as contemplated in 18 U. S. C.$ 3553(e) and USSG $ 5K1.1 for sentencing below the minimum, and ruled that, without such a motion, a court had nopower to go beneath the minimum. Wade got a sentence of180 months in prison.504us1$72z 04-04-96 21:08:22 PAGES OPINPGT184 WADE v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtIn the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Cir-cuit, Wade argued the District Court was in error to say thatthe absence of a Government motion deprived it of authorityto impose a sentence below 10 years for the drug convictions.Wade lost this argument, 936 F. 2d 169, 171 (1991), and failedas well on his back-up claim that the District Court was atleast authorized to enquire into the Government's motivesfor filing no motion, the court saying that any such enquirywould intrude unduly upon a prosecutor's discretion, id., at172. We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 1003 (1991), and nowaffirm.The full text of 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(e) is this:"Limited Authority to Impose a Sentence Below a Stat-utory Minimum.--Upon motion of the Government, thecourt shall have the authority to impose a sentencebelow a level established by statute as minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant's substantial assistancein the investigation or prosecution of another personwho has committed an offense.

S. C. $ 3553(e) and USSG $ 5K1.1. Wade and the Govern-ment apparently assume that where, as here, the minimum504us1$72z 04-04-96 21:08:22 PAGES OPINPGT185Cite as: 504 U. S. 181 (1992)Opinion of the Courtunder the Guidelines is the same as the statutory minimumand the Government has refused to file any motion at all,the two provisions pose identical and equally burdensomeobstacles. See Brief for Petitioner 9, n. 2; Brief for UnitedStates 11, n. 2. We are not, therefore, called upon to decide whether $ 5K1.1 "implements" and thereby supersedes$ 3553(e), seeUnited States v. Ah-Kai, 951 F. 2d 490, 493-494(CA2 1991); United States v. Keene, 933 F. 2d 711, 713-714(CA9 1991), or whether the two provisions pose two separateobstacles, see United States v. Rodriguez-Morales, 958 F. 2d1441, 1443-1447 (CA8 1992).Wade concedes, as a matter of statutory interpretation,that $ 3553(e) imposes the condition of a Government motionupon the district court's authority to depart, Brief for Petitioner 9-10, and he does not argue otherwise with respectto $ 5K1.1. He does not claim that the Government-motionrequirement is itself unconstitutional, or that the conditionis superseded in this case by any agreement on the Government's behalf to file a substantial-assistance motion, cf. Santobello v. New York, 404 U. S. 257, 262-263 (1971); UnitedStates v. Conner, 930 F. 2d 1073, 1075-1077 (CA4), cert. denied, 502 U. S. 958 (1991). Wade's position is consistent withthe view, which we think is clearly correct, that in both$ 3553(e) and $ 5K1.1 the condition limiting the court's authority gives the Government a power, not a duty, to file amotion when a defendant has substantially assisted.Wade nonetheless argues, and again we agree, that aprosecutor's discretion when exercising that power is subjectto constitutional limitations that district courts can enforce.Because we see no reason why courts should treat a prosecutor's refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion differentlyfrom a prosecutor's other decisions, see, e. g., Wayte v. UnitedStates, 470 U. S. 598, 608-609 (1985), we hold that federaldistrict courts have authority to review a prosecutor's refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion and to grant aremedy if they find that the refusal was based on an uncon504us1$72z 04-04-96 21:08:22 PAGES OPINPGT186 WADE v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtstitutional motive. Thus, a defendant would be entitled torelief if a prosecutor refused to file a substantial-assistancemotion, say, because of the defendant's race or religion.It follows that a claim that a defendant merely providedsubstantial assistance will not entitle a defendant to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing. Norwould additional but generalized allegations of improper motive. See, e. g., United States v. Redondo-Lemos, 955 F. 2d1296, 1302-1303 (CA9 1992);United States v. Jacob, 781 F. 2d643, 646-647 (CA8 1986); United States v. Gallegos-Curiel,681 F. 2d 1164, 1169 (CA9 1982) (Kennedy, J.);United Statesv. Berrios, 501 F. 2d 1207, 1211 (CA2 1974). Indeed, Wadeconcedes that a defendant has no right to discovery or anevidentiary hearing unless he makes a "substantial thresholdshowing." Brief for Petitioner 26.Wade has failed to make one. He has never alleged, muchless claimed to have evidence tending to show, that the Government refused to file a motion for suspect reasons such ashis race or his religion. Instead, Wade argues now that theDistrict Court thwarted his attempt to make quite differentallegations on the record because it erroneously believed thatno charge of impermissible motive could state a claim forrelief. Hence, he now seeks an order of remand to allow himto develop a claim that the Government violated his constitutional rights by withholding a substantial-assistance motion"arbitrarily" or "in bad faith." See Brief for Petitioner 25.This, Wade says, the Government did by refusing to movebecause of "factors that are not rationally related to any legitimate state objective," see Reply Brief for Petitioner 4,although he does not specifically identify any such factors.As the Government concedes, see Brief for United States26 (citing New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U. S. 297, 303 (1976)(per curiam)), Wade would be entitled to relief if the prosecutor's refusal to move was not rationally related to any legitimate Government end, cf. Chapman v. United States, 500U. S. 453, 464-465 (1991), but his argument is still of no avail.504us1$72z 04-04-96 21:08:22 PAGES OPINPGT187Cite as: 504 U.

The DistrictCourt expressly invited Wade's lawyer to state for the recordwhat evidence he would introduce to support his positionif the court were to conduct a hearing on the issue. App.10. In response, his counsel merely explained the extentof Wade's assistance to the Government. Ibid. This, ofcourse, was not enough, for although a showing of assistanceis a necessary condition for relief, it is not a sufficient one.The Government's decision not to move may have been basednot on a failure to acknowledge or appreciate Wade's help,but simply on its rational assessment of the cost and benefitthat would flow from moving. Cf. United States v. Doe, 290U. S. App. D. C. 65, 70, 934 F. 2d 353, 358, cert. denied, 502U. S. 896 (1991); United States v. La Guardia, 902 F. 2d 1010,1016 (CA1 1990).It is clear, then, that, on the present record, Wade is en-titled to no relief, and that the judgment of the Court ofAppeals must be
