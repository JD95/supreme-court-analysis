In Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981), we held thatlaw enforcement officers must immediately cease questioning a suspect who has clearly asserted his right to have coun-sel present during custodial interrogation. In this case wedecide how law enforcement officers should respond whena suspect makes a reference to counsel that is insufficiently clear to invoke the Edwards prohibition on furtherquestioning.IPool brought trouble--not to River City, but to theCharleston Naval Base. Petitioner, a member of the UnitedStates Navy, spent the evening of October 2, 1988, shootingpool at a club on the base. Another sailor, Keith Shackleton,lost a game and a $30 wager to petitioner, but Shackle-ton refused to pay. After the club closed, Shackleton wasbeaten to death with a pool cue on a loading dock behind thecommissary. The body was found early the next morning.The investigation by the Naval Investigative Service(NIS) gradually focused on petitioner. Investigative agentsdetermined that petitioner was at the club that evening, andthat he was absent without authorization from his dutystation the next morning. The agents also learned that onlyprivately owned pool cues could be removed from the clubpremises, and that petitioner owned two cues--one of whichhad a bloodstain on it. The agents were told by variouspeople that petitioner either had admitted committing thecrime or had recounted details that clearly indicated hisinvolvement in the killing.On November 4, 1988, petitioner was interviewed at theNIS office. As required by military law, the agents advisedpetitioner that he was a suspect in the killing, that he wasnot required to make a statement, that any statement couldbe used against him at a trial by court-martial, and that hewas entitled to speak with an attorney and have an attorneypresent during questioning.

Petitionerwaived his rights to remain silent and to counsel, both orallyand in writing.About an hour and a half into the interview, petitionersaid, "Maybe I should talk to a lawyer." App. 135. According to the uncontradicted testimony of one of the interviewing agents, the interview then proceeded as follows:"[We m]ade it very clear that we're not here to violatehis rights, that if he wants a lawyer, then we will stopany kind of questioning with him, that we weren't goingto pursue the matter unless we have it clarified is heasking for a lawyer or is he just making a commentabout a lawyer, and he said, [`]No, I'm not asking for alawyer,' and then he continued on, and said, `No, I don'twant a lawyer.' " Id., at 136.After a short break, the agents reminded petitioner of hisrights to remain silent and to counsel. The interview thencontinued for another hour, until petitioner said, "I think Iwant a lawyer before I say anything else." Id., at 137. Atthat point, questioning ceased.At his general court-martial, petitioner moved to suppressstatements made during the November 4 interview. TheMilitary Judge denied the motion, holding that "the mentionof a lawyer by [petitioner] during the course of the interrogation [was] not in the form of a request for counsel and . . .the agents properly determined that [petitioner] was not indicating a desire for or invoking his right to counsel." Id.,at 164. Petitioner was convicted on one specification ofunpremeditated murder, in violation of Art. 118, UCMJ, 10U. S. C. $ 918. He was sentenced to confinement for life, adishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances,and a reduction to the lowest pay grade.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtMarine Corps Court of Military Review affirmed. App. toPet. for Cert. 12a-15a.The United States Court of Military Appeals granted dis-cretionary review and affirmed. 36 M. J. 337 (1993). Thecourt recognized that the state and federal courts have de-veloped three different approaches to a suspect's ambiguousor equivocal request for counsel:"Some jurisdictions have held that any mention ofcounsel, however ambiguous, is sufficient to require thatall questioning cease. Others have attempted to definea threshold standard of clarity for invoking the right tocounsel and have held that comments falling short ofthe threshold do not invoke the right to counsel. Somejurisdictions . . . have held that all interrogation aboutthe offense must immediately cease whenever a suspectmentions counsel, but they allow interrogators to asknarrow questions designed to clarify the earlier statement and the [suspect's] desires respecting counsel."Id., at 341 (internal quotation marks omitted).Applying the third approach, the court held that petitioner'scomment was ambiguous, and that the NIS agents properly clarified petitioner's wishes with respect to counsel be-fore continuing questioning him about the offense.Id., at341-342.Although we have twice previously noted the varying ap-proaches the lower courts have adopted with respect to ambiguous or equivocal references to counsel during custodialinterrogation, seeConnecticut v. Barrett, 479 U. S. 523, 529-530, n. 3 (1987); Smith v. Illinois, 469 U. S. 91, 96, n. 3 (1984)(per curiam), we have not addressed the issue on the merits.We granted certiorari, 510 U. S. 942 (1993), to do so.IIThe Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches only atthe initiation of adversary criminal proceedings, see United512us2$83J 12-24-97 12:19:03 PAGES OPINPGT457Cite as: 512 U. S. 452 (1994)Opinion of the CourtStates v. Gouveia, 467 U. S. 180, 188 (1984), and before pro-ceedings are initiated a suspect in a criminal investigationhas no constitutional right to the assistance of counsel.Nevertheless, we held in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436,469-473 (1966), that a suspect subject to custodial interroga-tion has the right to consult with an attorney and to havecounsel present during questioning, and that the police mustexplain this right to him before questioning begins. Theright to counsel established in Miranda was one of a "seriesof recommended `procedural safeguards' . . . [that] were notthemselves rights protected by the Constitution but wereinstead measures to insure that the right against compulsoryself-incrimination was protected." Michigan v. Tucker, 417U. S. 433, 443-444 (1974); see U. S. Const., Amdt. 5 ("Noperson . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be awitness against himself ").**We have never had occasion to consider whether the Fifth Amendmentprivilege against self-incrimination, or the attendant right to counsel during custodial interrogation, applies of its own force to the military, and weneed not do so here. The President, exercising his authority to prescribeprocedures for military criminal proceedings, see Art. 36(a), UCMJ, 10U. S. C. $ 836(a), has decreed that statements obtained in violation of theSelf-Incrimination Clause are generally not admissible at trials by courtmartial. Mil. Rules Evid. 304(a) and (c)(3). Because the Court of Military Appeals has held that our cases construing the Fifth Amendmentright to counsel apply to military interrogations and control the admissibility of evidence at trials by court-martial, see, e. g., United States v. McLaren, 38 M. J. 112, 115 (1993); United States v. Applewhite, 23 M. J. 196,198 (1987), and the parties do not contest this point, we proceed on theassumption that our precedents apply to courts-martial just as they applyto state and federal criminal prosecutions.We also note that the Government has not sought to rely in this case on18 U. S. C. $ 3501, "the statute governing the admissibility of confessionsin federal prosecutions," United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez, 511 U. S. 350,351 (1994), and we therefore decline the invitation of some amici to consider it. See Brief for Washington Legal Foundation et al. as Amici Curiae 7-14. Although we will consider arguments raised only in an amicusbrief, see Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 300 (1989) (plurality opinion), weare reluctant to do so when the issue is one of first impression involving512us2$83J 12-24-97 12:19:03 PAGES OPINPGT458 DAVIS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtThe right to counsel recognized in Miranda is sufficientlyimportant to suspects in criminal investigations, we haveheld, that it "requir[es] the special protection of the knowingand intelligent waiver standard." Edwards v. Arizona, 451U. S., at 483. See Oregon v. Bradshaw, 462 U. S. 1039, 1046-1047 (1983) (plurality opinion);id., at 1051 (Powell, J., concur-ring in judgment). If the suspect effectively waives hisright to counsel after receiving the Miranda warnings, lawenforcement officers are free to question him. North Carolina v. Butler, 441 U. S. 369, 372-376 (1979). But if a sus-pect requests counsel at any time during the interview, he isnot subject to further questioning until a lawyer has beenmade available or the suspect himself reinitiates conversation. Edwards v. Arizona, supra, at 484-485. This "sec-ond layer of prophylaxis for theMiranda right to counsel,"McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S. 171, 176 (1991), is "designedto prevent police from badgering a defendant into waivinghis previously asserted Miranda rights," Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U. S. 344, 350 (1990). To that end, we have heldthat a suspect who has invoked the right to counsel cannotbe questioned regarding any offense unless an attorney isactually present.Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 146(1990); Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675 (1988). "It remains clear, however, that this prohibition on further ques-tioning--like other aspects of Miranda--is not itself required by the Fifth Amendment's prohibition on coercedconfessions, but is instead justified only by reference to itsprophylactic purpose." Connecticut v. Barrett, supra, at528.The applicability of the " `rigid' prophylactic rule" of Edwards requires courts to "determine whether the accusedactually invoked his right to counsel." Smith v. Illinois,supra, at 95 (emphasis added), quoting Fare v. Michael C.,442 U. S. 707, 719 (1979).

Invocation of the Miranda right to counsel "requires,at a minimum, some statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance ofan attorney." McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U. S., at 178. Butif a suspect makes a reference to an attorney that is ambiguous or equivocal in that a reasonable officer in light of thecircumstances would have understood only that the suspectmight be invoking the right to counsel, our precedents donot require the cessation of questioning. Seeibid. ("[T]helikelihood that a suspect would wish counsel to be presentis not the test for applicability of Edwards"); Edwards v.Arizona, supra, at 485 (impermissible for authorities "to reinterrogate an accused in custody if he has clearly assertedhis right to counsel") (emphasis added).Rather, the suspect must unambiguously request counsel.As we have observed, "a statement either is such an assertion of the right to counsel or it is not." Smith v. Illinois,469 U. S., at 97-98 (brackets and internal quotation marksomitted). Although a suspect need not "speak with the discrimination of an Oxford don," post, at 476 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment), he must articulate his desire to havecounsel present sufficiently clearly that a reasonable policeofficer in the circumstances would understand the statementto be a request for an attorney. If the statement fails tomeet the requisite level of clarity, Edwards does not requirethat the officers stop questioning the suspect. See Moranv. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412, 433, n. 4 (1986) ("[T]he interrogation must cease until an attorney is present only [i]f theindividual states that he wants an attorney") (citations andinternal quotation marks omitted).We decline petitioner's invitation to extend Edwards andrequire law enforcement officers to cease questioning immediately upon the making of an ambiguous or equivocal reference to an attorney. See Arizona v. Roberson, supra, at 688512us2$83J 12-24-97 12:19:03 PAGES OPINPGT460 DAVIS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court(Kennedy, J., dissenting) ("[T]he rule of Edwards is ourrule, not a constitutional command; and it is our obligationto justify its expansion"). The rationale underlying Edwards is that the police must respect a suspect's wishesregarding his right to have an attorney present during custodial interrogation. But when the officers conducting thequestioning reasonably do not know whether or not the suspect wants a lawyer, a rule requiring the immediate cessa-tion of questioning "would transform theMiranda safeguards into wholly irrational obstacles to legitimate policeinvestigative activity,"Michigan v. Mosley, 423 U. S. 96, 102(1975), because it would needlessly prevent the police fromquestioning a suspect in the absence of counsel even if thesuspect did not wish to have a lawyer present. Nothing inEdwards requires the provision of counsel to a suspect whoconsents to answer questions without the assistance of a lawyer. In Miranda itself, we expressly rejected the suggestion "that each police station must have a `station house lawyer' present at all times to advise prisoners," 384 U. S., at474, and held instead that a suspect must be told of his rightto have an attorney present and that he may not be questioned after invoking his right to counsel. We also notedthat if a suspect is "indecisive in his request for counsel," theofficers need not always cease questioning. See id., at 485.We recognize that requiring a clear assertion of the rightto counsel might disadvantage some suspects who--becauseof fear, intimidation, lack of linguistic skills, or a variety ofother reasons--will not clearly articulate their right to counsel although they actually want to have a lawyer present.But the primary protection afforded suspects subject to custodial interrogation is the Miranda warnings themselves."[F]ull comprehension of the rights to remain silent and request an attorney [is] sufficient to dispel whatever coercion isinherent in the interrogation process." Moran v. Burbine,supra, at 427. A suspect who knowingly and voluntarilywaives his right to counsel after having that right explained512us2$83J 12-24-97 12:19:03 PAGES OPINPGT461Cite as: 512 U. S. 452 (1994)Opinion of the Courtto him has indicated his willingness to deal with the policeunassisted. AlthoughEdwards provides an additional protection--if a suspect subsequently requests an attorney,questioning must cease--it is one that must be affirmativelyinvoked by the suspect.In considering how a suspect must invoke the right tocounsel, we must consider the other side of theMirandaequation: the need for effective law enforcement. Althoughthe courts ensure compliance with theMiranda requirements through the exclusionary rule, it is police officers whomust actually decide whether or not they can question a suspect. The Edwards rule--questioning must cease if thesuspect asks for a lawyer--provides a bright line that canbe applied by officers in the real world of investigation andinterrogation without unduly hampering the gathering of information. But if we were to require questioning to ceaseif a suspect makes a statement that might be a request foran attorney, this clarity and ease of application would be lost.Police officers would be forced to make difficult judgmentcalls about whether the suspect in fact wants a lawyer eventhough he has not said so, with the threat of suppression ifthey guess wrong. We therefore hold that, after a knowingand voluntary waiver of the Miranda rights, law enforcement officers may continue questioning until and unless thesuspect clearly requests an attorney.Of course, when a suspect makes an ambiguous or equivocal statement it will often be good police practice for theinterviewing officers to clarify whether or not he actuallywants an attorney. That was the procedure followed by theNIS agents in this case. Clarifying questions help protectthe rights of the suspect by ensuring that he gets an attorney if he wants one, and will minimize the chance of a confession being suppressed due to subsequent judicial secondguessing as to the meaning of the suspect's statementregarding counsel. But we decline to adopt a rule requiringofficers to ask clarifying questions. If the suspect's state512us2$83J 12-24-97 12:19:03 PAGES OPINPGT462 DAVIS v. UNITED STATESScalia, J., concurringment is not an unambiguous or unequivocal request for coun-sel, the officers have no obligation to stop questioning him.To recapitulate: We held in Miranda that a suspect is enti-tled to the assistance of counsel during custodial interrogation even though the Constitution does not provide for suchassistance. We held inEdwards that if the suspect invokesthe right to counsel at any time, the police must immediatelycease questioning him until an attorney is present. But weare unwilling to create a third layer of prophylaxis to prevent police questioning when the suspect might want a law-yer. Unless the suspect actually requests an attorney, questioning may continue.The courts below found that petitioner's remark to theNIS agents--"Maybe I should talk to a lawyer"--was not arequest for counsel, and we see no reason to disturb thatconclusion. The NIS agents therefore were not required tostop questioning petitioner, though it was entirely proper forthem to clarify whether petitioner in fact wanted a lawyer.Because there is no ground for suppression of petitioner'sstatements, the judgment of the Court of Military Appeals is
