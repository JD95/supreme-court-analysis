to Parts I, II, and III, concluding that a State, consistent with the FirstAmendment, may ban cross burning carried out with the intent to intimidate. Pp. 352-363.(a) Burning a cross in the United States is inextricably intertwinedwith the history of the Ku Klux Klan, which, following its formation in1866, imposed a reign of terror throughout the South, whipping, threatening, and murdering blacks, southern whites who disagreed with theKlan, and "carpetbagger" northern whites. The Klan has often usedcross burnings as a tool of intimidation and a threat of impending vio538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN344 VIRGINIA v. BLACKSyllabuslence, although such burnings have also remained potent symbols ofshared group identity and ideology, serving as a central feature of Klangatherings. To this day, however, regardless of whether the messageis a political one or is also meant to intimidate, the burning of a cross isa "symbol of hate." Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 771. While cross burning does not inevitablyconvey a message of intimidation, often the cross burner intends thatthe recipients of the message fear for their lives. And when a crossburning is used to intimidate, few if any messages are more powerful.Pp. 352-357.(b) The protections the First Amendment affords speech and expressive conduct are not absolute. This Court has long recognized that thegovernment may regulate certain categories of expression consistentwith the Constitution. See, e. g., Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315U. S. 568, 571-572. For example, the First Amendment permits a Stateto ban "true threats," e. g., Watts v. United States, 394 U. S. 705, 708(per curiam), which encompass those statements where the speakermeans to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit anact of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals,see, e. g., ibid. The speaker need not actually intend to carry out thethreat. Rather, a prohibition on true threats protects individuals fromthe fear of violence and the disruption that fear engenders, as well asfrom the possibility that the threatened violence will occur. R. A. V.,supra, at 388. Intimidation in the constitutionally proscribable senseof the word is a type of true threat, where a speaker directs a threat toa person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim infear of bodily harm or death. Respondents do not contest that somecross burnings fit within this meaning of intimidating speech, andrightly so. As the history of cross burning in this country shows, thatact is often intimidating, intended to create a pervasive fear in victimsthat they are a target of violence. Pp. 358-360.(c) The First Amendment permits Virginia to outlaw cross burningsdone with the intent to intimidate because burning a cross is a particularly virulent form of intimidation. Instead of prohibiting all intimidating messages, Virginia may choose to regulate this subset of intimidating messages in light of cross burning's long and pernicious history asa signal of impending violence. A ban on cross burning carried outwith the intent to intimidate is fully consistent with this Court's holdingin R. A. V. Contrary to the Virginia Supreme Court's ruling, R. A. V.did not hold that the First Amendment prohibits all forms of contentbased discrimination within a proscribable area of speech. Rather, theCourt specifically stated that a particular type of content discriminationdoes not violate the First Amendment when the basis for it consists538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN345Cite as: 538 U. S. 343 (2003)Syllabusentirely of the very reason its entire class of speech is proscribable.505 U. S., at 388. For example, it is permissible to prohibit only thatobscenity that is most patently offensive in its prurience--i. e., thatwhich involves the most lascivious displays of sexual activity. Ibid.Similarly, Virginia's statute does not run afoul of the First Amendmentinsofar as it bans cross burning with intent to intimidate. Unlike thestatute at issue in R. A. V., the Virginia statute does not single outfor opprobrium only that speech directed toward "one of the specifieddisfavored topics." Id., at 391. It does not matter whether an individual burns a cross with intent to intimidate because of the victim's race,gender, or religion, or because of the victim's "political affiliation, unionmembership, or homosexuality." Ibid. Thus, just as a State may regulate only that obscenity which is the most obscene due to its prurientcontent, so too may a State choose to prohibit only those forms of intimidation that are most likely to inspire fear of bodily harm. Pp. 360-363.Justice O'Connor, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Stevens, and Justice Breyer, concluded in Parts IV and V that the Virginia statute's prima facie evidence provision, as interpreted throughthe jury instruction given in respondent Black's case and as appliedtherein, is unconstitutional on its face. Because the instruction is thesame as the Commonwealth's Model Jury Instruction, and because theVirginia Supreme Court had the opportunity to expressly disavow it,the instruction's construction of the prima facie provision is as bindingon this Court as if its precise words had been written into the statute.E. g., Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1, 4. As construed by the instruction, the prima facie provision strips away the very reason why aState may ban cross burning with the intent to intimidate. The provision permits a jury to convict in every cross burning case in which defendants exercise their constitutional right not to put on a defense.And even where a defendant like Black presents a defense, the provisionmakes it more likely that the jury will find an intent to intimidate regardless of the particular facts of the case. It permits the Commonwealth to arrest, prosecute, and convict a person based solely on thefact of cross burning itself. As so interpreted, it would create an unacceptable risk of the suppression of ideas. E. g., Secretary of State ofMd. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947, 965, n. 13. The act ofburning a cross may mean that a person is engaging in constitutionallyproscribable intimidation, or it may mean only that the person is engaged in core political speech. The prima facie evidence provision blursthe line between these meanings, ignoring all of the contextual factorsthat are necessary to decide whether a particular cross burning is intended to intimidate. The First Amendment does not permit such ashortcut. Thus, Black's conviction cannot stand, and the judgment as538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN346 VIRGINIA v. BLACKSyllabusto him is affirmed. Conversely, Elliott's jury did not receive any instruction on the prima facie provision, and the provision was not anissue in O'Mara's case because he pleaded guilty. The possibility thatthe provision is severable, and if so, whether Elliott and O'Mara could beretried under the statute, is left open. Also left open is the theoreticalpossibility that, on remand, the Virginia Supreme Court could interpretthe prima facie provision in a manner that would avoid the constitutionalobjections described above. Pp. 363-368.Justice Scalia agreed that this Court should vacate and remand thejudgment of the Virginia Supreme Court with respect to respondentsElliott and O'Mara so that that court can have an opportunity authoritatively to construe the cross-burning statute's prima-facie-evidence provision. Pp. 368, 379.Justice Souter, joined by Justice Kennedy and Justice Ginsburg, concluded that the Virginia statute is unconstitutional and cannot be saved by any exception under R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377,and therefore concurred in the Court's judgment insofar as it affirmsthe invalidation of respondent Black's conviction.

BLACKOpinion of the Courtcross burning as prima facie evidence of intent to intimidaterenders the statute unconstitutional in its current form.IRespondents Barry Black, Richard Elliott, and JonathanO'Mara were convicted separately of violating Virginia'scross-burning statute, $ 18.2-423. That statute provides:"It shall be unlawful for any person or persons, withthe intent of intimidating any person or group of persons, to burn, or cause to be burned, a cross on the prop-erty of another, a highway or other public place. Anyperson who shall violate any provision of this sectionshall be guilty of a Class 6 felony."Any such burning of a cross shall be prima facie evi-dence of an intent to intimidate a person or group ofpersons."On August 22, 1998, Barry Black led a Ku Klux Klan rallyin Carroll County, Virginia. Twenty-five to thirty people attended this gathering, which occurred on private propertywith the permission of the owner, who was in attendance.The property was located on an open field just off BrushyFork Road (State Highway 690) in Cana, Virginia.When the sheriff of Carroll County learned that a Klanrally was occurring in his county, he went to observe it fromthe side of the road. During the approximately one hourthat the sheriff was present, about 40 to 50 cars passed thesite, a "few" of which stopped to ask the sheriff what washappening on the property. App. 71. Eight to ten houseswere located in the vicinity of the rally. Rebecca Sechrist,who was related to the owner of the property where the rallytook place, "sat and watched to see wha[t] [was] going on"from the lawn of her in-laws' house. She looked on as theKlan prepared for the gathering and subsequently conductedthe rally itself. Id., at 103.During the rally, Sechrist heard Klan members speakabout "what they were" and "what they believed in."Id.,538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN349Cite as: 538 U.

One speaker told the assembled gathering that "he would love to take a .30/.30 and justrandom[ly] shoot the blacks."Ibid. The speakers alsotalked about "President Clinton and Hillary Clinton," andabout how their tax money "goes to . . . the black people."Ibid. Sechrist testified that this language made her "very. . . scared." Id., at 110.At the conclusion of the rally, the crowd circled around a25- to 30-foot cross. The cross was between 300 and 350yards away from the road. According to the sheriff, thecross "then all of a sudden . . . went up in a flame." Id.,at 71. As the cross burned, the Klan played Amazing Graceover the loudspeakers. Sechrist stated that the cross burning made her feel "awful" and "terrible." Id., at 110.When the sheriff observed the cross burning, he informedhis deputy that they needed to "find out who's responsibleand explain to them that they cannot do this in the Stateof Virginia." Id., at 72. The sheriff then went down thedriveway, entered the rally, and asked "who was responsible for burning the cross." Id., at 74. Black responded,"I guess I am because I'm the head of the rally." Ibid. Thesheriff then told Black, "[T]here's a law in the State of Virginia that you cannot burn a cross and I'll have to place youunder arrest for this." Ibid.Black was charged with burning a cross with the intentof intimidating a person or group of persons, in violation of$ 18.2-423. At his trial, the jury was instructed that "intentto intimidate means the motivation to intentionally put aperson or a group of persons in fear of bodily harm. Suchfear must arise from the willful conduct of the accused ratherthan from some mere temperamental timidity of the victim."Id., at 146. The trial court also instructed the jury that "theburning of a cross by itself is sufficient evidence from whichyou may infer the required intent." Ibid. When Black objected to this last instruction on First Amendment grounds,538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN350 VIRGINIA v.

App., Dec. 19, 2000), App. 201.On May 2, 1998, respondents Richard Elliott and JonathanO'Mara, as well as a third individual, attempted to burna cross on the yard of James Jubilee. Jubilee, an African-American, was Elliott's next-door neighbor in VirginiaBeach, Virginia. Four months prior to the incident, Jubileeand his family had moved from California to Virginia Beach.Before the cross burning, Jubilee spoke to Elliott's motherto inquire about shots being fired from behind the Elliotthome. Elliott's mother explained to Jubilee that her sonshot firearms as a hobby, and that he used the backyard as afiring range.On the night of May 2, respondents drove a truck ontoJubilee's property, planted a cross, and set it on fire. Theirapparent motive was to "get back" at Jubilee for complainingabout the shooting in the backyard. Id., at 241. Respondents were not affiliated with the Klan. The next morning,as Jubilee was pulling his car out of the driveway, he noticedthe partially burned cross approximately 20 feet from hishouse. After seeing the cross, Jubilee was "very nervous"because he "didn't know what would be the next phase," andbecause "a cross burned in your yard . . . tells you that it'sjust the first round." Id., at 231.Elliott and O'Mara were charged with attempted crossburning and conspiracy to commit cross burning. O'Marapleaded guilty to both counts, reserving the right to challenge the constitutionality of the cross-burning statute.The judge sentenced O'Mara to 90 days in jail and fined him$2,500. The judge also suspended 45 days of the sentenceand $1,000 of the fine.At Elliott's trial, the judge originally ruled that the jurywould be instructed "that the burning of a cross by itself is538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN351Cite as: 538 U.

At trial, however, the court instructed the jury that the Commonwealth must prove that"the defendant intended to commit cross burning," that "thedefendant did a direct act toward the commission of the crossburning," and that "the defendant had the intent of intimidating any person or group of persons." Id., at 250. Thecourt did not instruct the jury on the meaning of the word"intimidate," nor on the prima facie evidence provision of$ 18.2-423. The jury found Elliott guilty of attempted crossburning and acquitted him of conspiracy to commit crossburning. It sentenced Elliott to 90 days in jail and a $2,500fine. The Court of Appeals of Virginia affirmed the convictions of both Elliott and O'Mara. O'Mara v. Commonwealth, 33 Va. App. 525, 535 S. E. 2d 175 (2000).Each respondent appealed to the Supreme Court of Virginia, arguing that $ 18.2-423 is facially unconstitutional.The Supreme Court of Virginia consolidated all three cases,and held that the statute is unconstitutional on its face. 262Va. 764, 553 S. E. 2d 738 (2001). It held that the Virginiacross-burning statute "is analytically indistinguishable fromthe ordinance found unconstitutional in R. A. V. [v. St. Paul,505 U. S. 377 (1992)]." Id., at 772, 553 S. E. 2d, at 742. TheVirginia statute, the court held, discriminates on the basis ofcontent since it "selectively chooses only cross burning because of its distinctive message." Id., at 774, 553 S. E. 2d,at 744. The court also held that the prima facie evidenceprovision renders the statute overbroad because "[t]he enhanced probability of prosecution under the statute chills theexpression of protected speech." Id., at 777, 553 S. E. 2d,at 746.Three justices dissented, concluding that the Virginiacross-burning statute passes constitutional muster because itproscribes only conduct that constitutes a true threat. Thejustices noted that unlike the ordinance found unconstitutional in R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377 (1992), the Virginia538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN352 VIRGINIA v. BLACKOpinion of the Courtstatute does not just target cross burning "on the basis ofrace, color, creed, religion or gender." 262 Va., at 791, 553S. E. 2d, at 753. Rather, "the Virginia statute applies toany individual who burns a cross for any reason provided thecross is burned with the intent to intimidate." Ibid. Thedissenters also disagreed with the majority's analysis of theprima facie provision because the inference alone "is clearlyinsufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant burned a cross with the intent to intimidate." Id.,at 795, 553 S. E. 2d, at 756. The dissent noted that the burden of proof still remains on the Commonwealth to proveintent to intimidate. We granted certiorari. 535 U. S.1094 (2002).1 IICross burning originated in the 14th century as a meansfor Scottish tribes to signal each other. See M. Newton &J. Newton, The Ku Klux Klan: An Encyclopedia 145 (1991).Sir Walter Scott used cross burnings for dramatic effect inThe Lady of the Lake, where the burning cross signified botha summons and a call to arms. See W. Scott, The Lady ofThe Lake, canto third. Cross burning in this country, how-ever, long ago became unmoored from its Scottish ancestry.Burning a cross in the United States is inextricably inter-twined with the history of the Ku Klux Klan.The first Ku Klux Klan began in Pulaski, Tennessee, in thespring of 1866. Although the Ku Klux Klan started as asocial club, it soon changed into something far different.The Klan fought Reconstruction and the corresponding driveto allow freed blacks to participate in the political process.1 After we granted certiorari, the Commonwealth enacted another statute designed to remedy the constitutional problems identified by the statecourt. See Va. Code Ann. $ 18.2-423.01 (2002). Section 18.2-423.01 bansthe burning of "an object" when done "with the intent of intimidating anyperson or group of persons." The statute does not contain any primafacie evidence provision. Section 18.2-423.01, however, did not repeal$ 18.2-423, the cross-burning statute at issue in this case.538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN353Cite as: 538 U. S. 343 (2003)Opinion of the CourtSoon the Klan imposed "a veritable reign of terror" through-out the South. S. Kennedy, Southern Exposure 31 (1991)(hereinafter Kennedy). The Klan employed tactics such aswhipping, threatening to burn people at the stake, and murder. W. Wade, The Fiery Cross: The Ku Klux Klan inAmerica 48-49 (1987) (hereinafter Wade). The Klan's victims included blacks, southern whites who disagreed withthe Klan, and "carpetbagger" northern whites.The activities of the Ku Klux Klan prompted legislativeaction at the national level. In 1871, "President Grant senta message to Congress indicating that the Klan's reign ofterror in the Southern States had rendered life and propertyinsecure." Jett v. Dallas Independent School Dist., 491U. S. 701, 722 (1989) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). In response, Congress passed what is nowknown as the Ku Klux Klan Act. See "An Act to enforcethe Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and for other Purposes," 17 Stat.13 (now codified at 42 U. S. C. $$ 1983, 1985, and 1986). President Grant used these new powers to suppress the Klan inSouth Carolina, the effect of which severely curtailed theKlan in other States as well. By the end of Reconstructionin 1877, the first Klan no longer existed.The genesis of the second Klan began in 1905, with thepublication of Thomas Dixon's The Clansmen: An HistoricalRomance of the Ku Klux Klan. Dixon's book was a sympathetic portrait of the first Klan, depicting the Klan as a groupof heroes "saving" the South from blacks and the "horrors"of Reconstruction. Although the first Klan never actuallypracticed cross burning, Dixon's book depicted the Klanburning crosses to celebrate the execution of former slaves.Id., at 324-326; see also Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 770-771 (1995) (Thomas,J., concurring). Cross burning thereby became associatedwith the first Ku Klux Klan. When D. W. Griffith turnedDixon's book into the movie The Birth of a Nation in 1915,538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN354 VIRGINIA v. BLACKOpinion of the Courtthe association between cross burning and the Klan becameindelible. In addition to the cross burnings in the movie,a poster advertising the film displayed a hooded Klansmanriding a hooded horse, with his left hand holding the reinsof the horse and his right hand holding a burning cross abovehis head. Wade 127. Soon thereafter, in November 1915,the second Klan began.From the inception of the second Klan, cross burningshave been used to communicate both threats of violence andmessages of shared ideology. The first initiation ceremonyoccurred on Stone Mountain near Atlanta, Georgia. Whilea 40-foot cross burned on the mountain, the Klan memberstook their oaths of loyalty. See Kennedy 163. This crossburning was the second recorded instance in the UnitedStates. The first known cross burning in the country hadoccurred a little over one month before the Klan initiation,when a Georgia mob celebrated the lynching of Leo Frankby burning a "gigantic cross" on Stone Mountain that was"visible throughout" Atlanta. Wade 144 (internal quotationmarks omitted).The new Klan's ideology did not differ much from that ofthe first Klan. As one Klan publication emphasized, "Weavow the distinction between [the] races, . . . and we shallever be true to the faithful maintenance of White Supremacyand will strenuously oppose any compromise thereof in anyand all things." Id., at 147-148 (internal quotation marksomitted). Violence was also an elemental part of this newKlan. By September 1921, the New York World newspaperdocumented 152 acts of Klan violence, including 4 murders,41 floggings, and 27 tar-and-featherings. Wade 160.Often, the Klan used cross burnings as a tool of intimidation and a threat of impending violence. For example, in1939 and 1940, the Klan burned crosses in front of synagogues and churches. See Kennedy 175. After one crossburning at a synagogue, a Klan member noted that if thecross burning did not "shut the Jews up, we'll cut a few538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN355Cite as: 538 U. S. 343 (2003)Opinion of the Courtthroats and see what happens." Ibid. (internal quotationmarks omitted). In Miami in 1941, the Klan burned fourcrosses in front of a proposed housing project, declaring, "Weare here to keep niggers out of your town . . . . When thelaw fails you, call on us." Id., at 176 (internal quotationmarks omitted). And in Alabama in 1942, in "a whirlwindclimax to weeks of flogging and terror," the Klan burnedcrosses in front of a union hall and in front of a union leader'shome on the eve of a labor election.Id., at 180. Thesecross burnings embodied threats to people whom the Klandeemed antithetical to its goals. And these threats had special force given the long history of Klan violence.The Klan continued to use cross burnings to intimidateafter World War II. In one incident, an African-American"school teacher who recently moved his family into a blockformerly occupied only by whites asked the protection of citypolice . . . after the burning of a cross in his front yard."Richmond News Leader, Jan. 21, 1949, p. 19, App. 312. Andafter a cross burning in Suffolk, Virginia, during the late1940's, the Virginia Governor stated that he would "not allowany of our people of any race to be subjected to terrorism orintimidation in any form by the Klan or any other organization." D. Chalmers, Hooded Americanism: The History ofthe Ku Klux Klan 333 (1980) (hereinafter Chalmers). Theseincidents of cross burning, among others, helped prompt Virginia to enact its first version of the cross-burning statutein 1950.The decision of this Court in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), along with the civil rightsmovement of the 1950's and 1960's, sparked another outbreak of Klan violence. These acts of violence includedbombings, beatings, shootings, stabbings, and mutilations.See, e. g., Chalmers 349-350; Wade 302-303. Members ofthe Klan burned crosses on the lawns of those associatedwith the civil rights movement, assaulted the Freedom Riders, bombed churches, and murdered blacks as well as whites538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN356 VIRGINIA v. BLACKOpinion of the Courtwhom the Klan viewed as sympathetic toward the civilrights movement.Throughout the history of the Klan, cross burnings havealso remained potent symbols of shared group identity andideology. The burning cross became a symbol of the Klanitself and a central feature of Klan gatherings. Accordingto the Klan constitution (called the kloran), the "fiery cross"was the "emblem of that sincere, unselfish devotedness ofall klansmen to the sacred purpose and principles we haveespoused." The Ku Klux Klan Hearings before the HouseCommittee on Rules, 67th Cong., 1st Sess., 114, Exh. G(1921); see also Wade 419. And the Klan has often publishedits newsletters and magazines under the name The FieryCross. See id., at 226, 489.At Klan gatherings across the country, cross burningbecame the climax of the rally or the initiation. Postersadvertising an upcoming Klan rally often featured a Klanmember holding a cross. See N. MacLean, Behind the Maskof Chivalry: The Making of the Second Ku Klux Klan 142-143 (1994). Typically, a cross burning would start with aprayer by the "Klavern" minister, followed by the singing ofOnward Christian Soldiers. The Klan would then light thecross on fire, as the members raised their left arm towardthe burning cross and sang The Old Rugged Cross. Wade185. Throughout the Klan's history, the Klan continued touse the burning cross in their ritual ceremonies.For its own members, the cross was a sign of celebrationand ceremony. During a joint Nazi-Klan rally in 1940, theproceeding concluded with the wedding of two Klan members who "were married in full Klan regalia beneath a blazing cross." Id., at 271. In response to antimasking billsintroduced in state legislatures after World War II, the Klanburned crosses in protest. See Chalmers 340. On March26, 1960, the Klan engaged in rallies and cross burningsthroughout the South in an attempt to recruit 10 millionmembers. See Wade 305. Later in 1960, the Klan became538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN357Cite as: 538 U. S. 343 (2003)Opinion of the Courtan issue in the third debate between Richard Nixon and JohnKennedy, with both candidates renouncing the Klan. Afterthis debate, the Klan reiterated its support for Nixon byburning crosses. See id., at 309. And cross burnings featured prominently in Klan rallies when the Klan attemptedto move toward more nonviolent tactics to stop integration.See id., at 323; cf. Chalmers 368-369, 371-372, 380, 384. Inshort, a burning cross has remained a symbol of Klan ideology and of Klan unity.To this day, regardless of whether the message is a political one or whether the message is also meant to intimidate,the burning of a cross is a "symbol of hate." Capitol SquareReview and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S., at 771(Thomas, J., concurring). And while cross burning sometimes carries no intimidating message, at other times theintimidating message is the only message conveyed. Forexample, when a cross burning is directed at a particularperson not affiliated with the Klan, the burning cross oftenserves as a message of intimidation, designed to inspire inthe victim a fear of bodily harm. Moreover, the history ofviolence associated with the Klan shows that the possibilityof injury or death is not just hypothetical. The person whoburns a cross directed at a particular person often is making a serious threat, meant to coerce the victim to complywith the Klan's wishes unless the victim is willing to riskthe wrath of the Klan. Indeed, as the cases of respondentsElliott and O'Mara indicate, individuals without Klan affiliation who wish to threaten or menace another person sometimes use cross burning because of this association betweena burning cross and violence.In sum, while a burning cross does not inevitably conveya message of intimidation, often the cross burner intendsthat the recipients of the message fear for their lives. Andwhen a cross burning is used to intimidate, few if any messages are more powerful.538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN358 VIRGINIA v. BLACKOpinion of the CourtIIIAThe First Amendment, applicable to the States throughthe Fourteenth Amendment, provides that "Congress shallmake no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech." Thehallmark of the protection of free speech is to allow "freetrade in ideas"--even ideas that the overwhelming majorityof people might find distasteful or discomforting. Abramsv. United States, 250 U. S. 616, 630 (1919) (Holmes, J., dissenting); see also Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397, 414 (1989) ("Ifthere is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itselfoffensive or disagreeable"). Thus, the First Amendment"ordinarily" denies a State "the power to prohibit dissemination of social, economic and political doctrine which a vastmajority of its citizens believes to be false and fraught withevil consequence." Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357,374 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring). The First Amendmentaffords protection to symbolic or expressive conduct as wellas to actual speech. See, e. g., R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul,505 U. S., at 382; Texas v. Johnson, supra, at 405-406; UnitedStates v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 376-377 (1968); Tinker v.Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U. S.503, 505 (1969).The protections afforded by the First Amendment, however, are not absolute, and we have long recognized thatthe government may regulate certain categories of expression consistent with the Constitution. See, e. g., Chaplinskyv. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568, 571-572 (1942) ("There arecertain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech,the prevention and punishment of which has never beenthought to raise any Constitutional problem"). The FirstAmendment permits "restrictions upon the content of speechin a few limited areas, which are `of such slight social value538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN359Cite as: 538 U. S. 343 (2003)Opinion of the Courtas a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived fromthem is clearly outweighed by the social interest in orderand morality.' " R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul, supra, at 382-383 (quotingChaplinsky v. New Hampshire, supra, at 572).Thus, for example, a State may punish those words "whichby their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite animmediate breach of the peace." Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, supra, at 572; see also R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul,supra, at 383 (listing limited areas where the First Amendment permits restrictions on the content of speech). Wehave consequently held that fighting words--"those personally abusive epithets which, when addressed to the ordinarycitizen, are, as a matter of common knowledge, inherentlylikely to provoke violent reaction"--are generally proscribable under the First Amendment. Cohen v. California, 403U. S. 15, 20 (1971); see also Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,supra, at 572. Furthermore, "the constitutional guaranteesof free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbidor proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violationexcept where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or producesuch action." Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444, 447 (1969)(per curiam). And the First Amendment also permits aState to ban a "true threat." Watts v. United States, 394U. S. 705, 708 (1969) (per curiam) (internal quotation marksomitted); accord, R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul, supra, at 388("[T]hreats of violence are outside the First Amendment");Madsen v. Women's Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753, 774(1994); Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of Western N. Y., 519U. S. 357, 373 (1997)."True threats" encompass those statements where thespeaker means to communicate a serious expression of anintent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particularindividual or group of individuals. See Watts v. UnitedStates, supra, at 708 ("political hyberbole" is not a truethreat); R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U. S., at 388. The538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN360 VIRGINIA v. BLACKOpinion of the Courtspeaker need not actually intend to carry out the threat.Rather, a prohibition on true threats "protect[s] individualsfrom the fear of violence" and "from the disruption that fearengenders," in addition to protecting people "from the possibility that the threatened violence will occur." Ibid. In-timidation in the constitutionally proscribable sense of theword is a type of true threat, where a speaker directs athreat to a person or group of persons with the intent ofplacing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death. Respond-ents do not contest that some cross burnings fit within thismeaning of intimidating speech, and rightly so. As notedin Part II,supra, the history of cross burning in this coun-try shows that cross burning is often intimidating, intendedto create a pervasive fear in victims that they are a targetof violence.BThe Supreme Court of Virginia ruled that in light ofR. A. V. v. City of St. Paul, supra, even if it is constitutionalto ban cross burning in a content-neutral manner, the Virginia cross-burning statute is unconstitutional because itdiscriminates on the basis of content and viewpoint. 262Va., at 771-776, 553 S. E. 2d, at 742-745. It is true, as theSupreme Court of Virginia held, that the burning of a crossis symbolic expression. The reason why the Klan burns across at its rallies, or individuals place a burning cross onsomeone else's lawn, is that the burning cross representsthe message that the speaker wishes to communicate. Individuals burn crosses as opposed to other means of communi-cation because cross burning carries a message in an effective and dramatic manner.22 Justice Thomas argues in dissent that cross burning is "conduct, notexpression." Post, at 394. While it is of course true that burning a crossis conduct, it is equally true that the First Amendment protects symbolicconduct as well as pure speech. See supra, at 358. As Justice Thomashas previously recognized, a burning cross is a "symbol of hate," and a538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN361Cite as: 538 U. S. 343 (2003)Opinion of the CourtThe fact that cross burning is symbolic expression, how-ever, does not resolve the constitutional question. The Supreme Court of Virginia relied upon R. A. V. v. City ofSt. Paul, supra, to conclude that once a statute discriminateson the basis of this type of content, the law is unconstitu-tional. We disagree.In R. A. V., we held that a local ordinance that bannedcertain symbolic conduct, including cross burning, when donewith the knowledge that such conduct would " `arouse anger,alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color,creed, religion or gender' " was unconstitutional. Id., at 380(quoting the St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance,St. Paul, Minn., Legis. Code $ 292.02 (1990)). We held thatthe ordinance did not pass constitutional muster because itdiscriminated on the basis of content by targeting only thoseindividuals who "provoke violence" on a basis specified inthe law. 505 U. S., at 391. The ordinance did not cover"[t]hose who wish to use `fighting words' in connection withother ideas--to express hostility, for example, on the basisof political affiliation, union membership, or homosexuality."Ibid. This content-based discrimination was unconstitu-tional because it allowed the city "to impose special prohibitions on those speakers who express views on disfavoredsubjects."Ibid.We did not hold in R. A. V. that the First Amendmentprohibitsall forms of content-based discrimination within aproscribable area of speech. Rather, we specifically statedthat some types of content discrimination did not violate theFirst Amendment:"When the basis for the content discrimination consistsentirely of the very reason the entire class of speechat issue is proscribable, no significant danger of idea or"a symbol of white supremacy." Capitol Square Review and AdvisoryBd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 770-771 (1995) (concurring opinion).538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN362 VIRGINIA v. BLACKOpinion of the Courtviewpoint discrimination exists. Such a reason, havingbeen adjudged neutral enough to support exclusion ofthe entire class of speech from First Amendment protec-tion, is also neutral enough to form the basis of distinction within the class." Id., at 388.Indeed, we noted that it would be constitutional to banonly a particular type of threat: "[T]he Federal Governmentcan criminalize only those threats of violence that aredirected against the President . . . since the reasons whythreats of violence are outside the First Amendment . . .have special force when applied to the person of the President." Ibid. And a State may "choose to prohibit only thatobscenity which is the most patently offensive in its prurience--i. e., that which involves the most lascivious displaysof sexual activity." Ibid. (emphasis in original). Consequently, while the holding of R. A. V. does not permit a Stateto ban only obscenity based on "offensive political messages," ibid., or "only those threats against the Presidentthat mention his policy on aid to inner cities," ibid., the FirstAmendment permits content discrimination "based on thevery reasons why the particular class of speech at issue . . .is proscribable," id., at 393.Similarly, Virginia's statute does not run afoul of the FirstAmendment insofar as it bans cross burning with intent tointimidate. Unlike the statute at issue inR. A. V., theVirginia statute does not single out for opprobrium only thatspeech directed toward "one of the specified disfavoredtopics." Id., at 391. It does not matter whether an individual burns a cross with intent to intimidate because of thevictim's race, gender, or religion, or because of the victim's"political affiliation, union membership, or homosexuality."Ibid. Moreover, as a factual matter it is not true that crossburners direct their intimidating conduct solely to racial orreligious minorities. See, e. g., supra, at 355 (noting the instances of cross burnings directed at union members); Statev.Miller, 6 Kan. App. 2d 432, 629 P. 2d 748 (1981) (describing538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN363Cite as: 538 U. S. 343 (2003)Opinion of O'Connor, J.the case of a defendant who burned a cross in the yard ofthe lawyer who had previously represented him and who wascurrently prosecuting him). Indeed, in the case of Elliottand O'Mara, it is at least unclear whether the respondentsburned a cross due to racial animus. See 262 Va., at 791, 553S. E. 2d, at 753 (Hassell, J., dissenting) (noting that "thesedefendants burned a cross because they were angry thattheir neighbor had complained about the presence of a firearm shooting range in the Elliott's yard, not because of anyracial animus").The First Amendment permits Virginia to outlaw crossburnings done with the intent to intimidate because burninga cross is a particularly virulent form of intimidation. In-stead of prohibiting all intimidating messages, Virginia maychoose to regulate this subset of intimidating messages inlight of cross burning's long and pernicious history as asignal of impending violence. Thus, just as a State may reg-ulate only that obscenity which is the most obscene due toits prurient content, so too may a State choose to prohibitonly those forms of intimidation that are most likely to inspire fear of bodily harm. A ban on cross burning carriedout with the intent to intimidate is fully consistent withour holding in R. A. V. and is proscribable under the FirstAmendment.IVThe Supreme Court of Virginia ruled in the alternativethat Virginia's cross-burning statute was unconstitutionallyoverbroad due to its provision stating that "[a]ny such burn-ing of a cross shall be prima facie evidence of an intent tointimidate a person or group of persons." Va. Code Ann.$ 18.2-423 (1996). The Commonwealth added the primafacie provision to the statute in 1968. The court below didnot reach whether this provision is severable from the rest ofthe cross-burning statute under Virginia law. See $ 1-17.1("The provisions of all statutes are severable unless . . . it is538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN364 VIRGINIA v. BLACKOpinion of O'Connor, J.apparent that two or more statutes or provisions must oper-ate in accord with one another"). In this Court, as in theSupreme Court of Virginia, respondents do not argue thatthe prima facie evidence provision is unconstitutional as applied to any one of them. Rather, they contend that theprovision is unconstitutional on its face.The Supreme Court of Virginia has not ruled on the meaning of the prima facie evidence provision. It has, however,stated that "the act of burning a cross alone, with no evidence of intent to intimidate, will nonetheless suffice for ar-rest and prosecution and will insulate the Commonwealthfrom a motion to strike the evidence at the end of its case-inchief." 262 Va., at 778, 553 S. E. 2d, at 746. The jury inthe case of Richard Elliott did not receive any instruction onthe prima facie evidence provision, and the provision was notan issue in the case of Jonathan O'Mara because he pleadedguilty. The court in Barry Black's case, however, instructedthe jury that the provision means: "The burning of a cross,by itself, is sufficient evidence from which you may infer therequired intent." App. 196. This jury instruction is thesame as the Model Jury Instruction in the Commonwealth ofVirginia. See Virginia Model Jury Instructions, Criminal,Instruction No. 10.250 (1998 and Supp. 2001).The prima facie evidence provision, as interpreted by thejury instruction, renders the statute unconstitutional. Because this jury instruction is the Model Jury Instruction, andbecause the Supreme Court of Virginia had the opportunityto expressly disavow the jury instruction, the jury instruction's construction of the prima facie provision "is a rulingon a question of state law that is as binding on us as thoughthe precise words had been written into" the statute. E. g.,Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1, 4 (1949) (striking downan ambiguous statute on facial grounds based upon theinstruction given to the jury); see also New York v. Ferber,458 U. S. 747, 768, n. 21 (1982) (noting that Terminiello involved a facial challenge to the statute); Secretary of State538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN365Cite as: 538 U. S. 343 (2003)Opinion of O'Connor, J.of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947, 965, n. 13(1984); Note, The First Amendment Overbreadth Doctrine,83 Harv. L. Rev. 844, 845-846, n. 8 (1970); Monaghan, Over-breadth, 1981 S. Ct. Rev. 1, 10-12; Blakey & Murray, Threats,Free Speech, and the Jurisprudence of the Federal CriminalLaw, 2002 B. Y. U. L. Rev. 829, 883, n. 133. As construed bythe jury instruction, the prima facie provision strips awaythe very reason why a State may ban cross burning withthe intent to intimidate. The prima facie evidence provisionpermits a jury to convict in every cross-burning case inwhich defendants exercise their constitutional right not toput on a defense. And even where a defendant like Blackpresents a defense, the prima facie evidence provision makesit more likely that the jury will find an intent to intimidateregardless of the particular facts of the case. The provisionpermits the Commonwealth to arrest, prosecute, and convicta person based solely on the fact of cross burning itself.It is apparent that the provision as so interpreted " `wouldcreate an unacceptable risk of the suppression of ideas.' "Secretary of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., supra,at 965, n. 13 (quoting Members of City Council of LosAngeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S. 789, 797 (1984)).The act of burning a cross may mean that a person is engaging in constitutionally proscribable intimidation. But thatsame act may mean only that the person is engaged in corepolitical speech. The prima facie evidence provision inthis statute blurs the line between these two meanings ofa burning cross. As interpreted by the jury instruction, theprovision chills constitutionally protected political speechbecause of the possibility that the Commonwealth will prosecute--and potentially convict--somebody engaging only inlawful political speech at the core of what the First Amendment is designed to protect.As the history of cross burning indicates, a burning crossis not always intended to intimidate. Rather, sometimes thecross burning is a statement of ideology, a symbol of group538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN366 VIRGINIA v. BLACKOpinion of O'Connor, J.solidarity. It is a ritual used at Klan gatherings, and it isused to represent the Klan itself. Thus, "[b]urning a crossat a political rally would almost certainly be protected ex-pression."R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S., at 402, n. 4 (White,J., concurring in judgment) (citing Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395U. S., at 445). Cf.National Socialist Party of America v.Skokie, 432 U. S. 43 (1977) (per curiam). Indeed, occasionally a person who burns a cross does not intend to expresseither a statement of ideology or intimidation. Cross burnings have appeared in movies such as Mississippi Burning,and in plays such as the stage adaptation of Sir WalterScott's The Lady of the Lake.The prima facie provision makes no effort to distinguishamong these different types of cross burnings. It does notdistinguish between a cross burning done with the purposeof creating anger or resentment and a cross burning donewith the purpose of threatening or intimidating a victim. Itdoes not distinguish between a cross burning at a public rallyor a cross burning on a neighbor's lawn. It does not treatthe cross burning directed at an individual differently fromthe cross burning directed at a group of like-minded believers. It allows a jury to treat a cross burning on the property of another with the owner's acquiescence in the samemanner as a cross burning on the property of another without the owner's permission. To this extent I agree withJustice Souter that the prima facie evidence provision can"skew jury deliberations toward conviction in cases wherethe evidence of intent to intimidate is relatively weak andarguably consistent with a solely ideological reason for burning." Post, at 385 (opinion concurring in judgment in partand dissenting in part).It may be true that a cross burning, even at a politicalrally, arouses a sense of anger or hatred among the vast majority of citizens who see a burning cross. But this sense ofanger or hatred is not sufficient to ban all cross burnings.As Gerald Gunther has stated, "The lesson I have drawn538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN367Cite as: 538 U. S. 343 (2003)Opinion of O'Connor, J.from my childhood in Nazi Germany and my happier adultlife in this country is the need to walk the sometimes difficultpath of denouncing the bigot's hateful ideas with all mypower, yet at the same time challenging any community'sattempt to suppress hateful ideas by force of law." Casper,Gerry, 55 Stan. L. Rev. 647, 649 (2002) (internal quotationmarks omitted). The prima facie evidence provision in thiscase ignores all of the contextual factors that are necessaryto decide whether a particular cross burning is intendedto intimidate. The First Amendment does not permit sucha shortcut.For these reasons, the prima facie evidence provision, asinterpreted through the jury instruction and as applied inBarry Black's case, is unconstitutional on its face. We recognize that the Supreme Court of Virginia has not authoritatively interpreted the meaning of the prima facie evidenceprovision. Unlike Justice Scalia, we refuse to speculateon whether any interpretation of the prima facie evidenceprovision would satisfy the First Amendment. Rather, allwe hold is that because of the interpretation of the primafacie evidence provision given by the jury instruction, theprovision makes the statute facially invalid at this point.We also recognize the theoretical possibility that the court,on remand, could interpret the provision in a manner different from that so far set forth in order to avoid the constitutional objections we have described. We leave open thatpossibility. We also leave open the possibility that the provision is severable, and if so, whether Elliott and O'Maracould be retried under $ 18.2-423.VWith respect to Barry Black, we agree with the SupremeCourt of Virginia that his conviction cannot stand, and weaffirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia.With respect to Elliott and O'Mara, we vacate the judgment538US2 Unit: $U39 [10-30-04 18:46:44] PAGES PGT: OPIN368 VIRGINIA v.
