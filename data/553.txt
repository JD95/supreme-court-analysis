by  simply  taxing  the  capital  within  its  borders--the  unitary  business 
principle  shifted  the  constitutional  inquiry  from  the  niceties  of  geo-
graphic  accounting  to  the  determination  of  a  taxpayer's  business  unit. 
If  the value  the State wished to tax derived from a "unitary business" 
operated  within  and  without  the  State,  the  State  could  tax  an  appor-
tioned share of that business' value instead of isolating the value attrib-
utable  to  the  intrastate  operation.  E. g.,  Exxon  Corp.  v.  Department 
of Revenue of Wis., 447 U. S. 207, 223.  But if the value derived from a 
"discrete  business  enterprise,"  Mobil  Oil  Corp.  v.  Commissioner  of 
Taxes of  Vt., 445 U. S. 425, 439, the State could not tax even an appor-
tioned share.  E. g., Container Corp. of America v.  Franchise Tax Bd., 
463  U. S.  159,  165-166.  This  principle  was  extended  to  a  multistate 
business that lacked the "physical unity" of wires or rails but exhibited 
the  "same  unity  in  the  use  of  the  entire  property  for  the  specific  pur-
pose," with "the same elements of value arising from such use," Adams 
Express Co. v.  Ohio State Auditor, 165 U. S. 194, 221; and it has justified 
apportioned  taxation  of  net  income,  dividends,  capital  gain,  and  other 
intangibles.  Confronting  the  problem  of  how  to  determine  exactly 
when  a  business  is  unitary,  this  Court  found  in  Allied-Signal  that  the 
"principle is not so inflexible that as new [finance] methods . . . and new 
[business] forms . . . evolve it cannot be modified or supplemented where 
appropriate," 504 U. S., at 786, and explained that situations could occur 
in which apportionment might be constitutional even though "the payee 
and the payor [were] not . . . engaged in the same unitary business," id., 
at  787.  In  that  context,  the  Court  observed  that  an  asset  could  form 
part of a taxpayer's unitary business if it served an "operational rather 
than an investment function" in the business, ibid.; and noted that Con-
tainer Corp., supra, at 180, n. 19, made the same point.  Pp. 25-29. 

(c)  Thus,  the  "operational  function"  references  in  Container  Corp. 
and  Allied-Signal  were  not  intended  to  modify  the  unitary  business 
principle  by  adding  a  new  apportionment  ground.  The  operational 
function concept simply recognizes that an asset can be a part of a tax-
payer's unitary business even without a "unitary relationship" between 
the "payor and payee."  In Allied-Signal and in Corn Products Refin-
ing  Co.  v.  Commissioner,  350  U. S.  46,  the  conclusion  that  an  asset 
served an operational function was merely instrumental to the constitu-
tionally  relevant  conclusion  that  the  asset  was  a  unitary  part  of  the 
business  conducted  in  the  taxing  State  rather  than  a  discrete  asset  to 
which the  State had no  claim.  Container  Corp.  and  Allied-Signal  did 
not  announce  a  new  ground  for  constitutional  apportionment,  and  the 
Illinois  Appellate  Court  erred  in  concluding  otherwise.  Here,  where 
the  asset  is  another  business,  a  unitary  relationship's  "hallmarks"  are 
functional integration, centralized management, and economies of scale.

Syllabus  

See Mobil Oil Corp., supra, at 438.  The trial court found each hallmark 
lacking in finding that Lexis was not a unitary part of Mead's business. 
However, the appellate court made no such determination.  Relying on 
its operational  function test,  it reserved  the unitary  business  question, 
which it may take up on remand.  Pp. 29-30. 

2.  Because the alternative  ground for affirmance  urged  by  the State 
and its amici--that the record amply demonstrates that Lexis did sub-
stantial business in Illinois and that Lexis' own contacts with the State 
suffice to justify the apportionment of Mead's capital gain--was neither 
raised nor passed upon in the state courts, it will not be addressed here. 
The case for restraint is particularly compelling here, since the question 
may impact other jurisdictions' laws.  Pp. 30-31.

REVENUE  

Opinion of the Court  

in 1846, Mead has been in the business of producing and sell-ing  paper,  packaging,  and  school  and  office  supplies.

1  In 

1968, Mead paid $6 million to acquire a company called Data Corporation, which owned an inkjet printing technology and 

a  full-text  information  retrieval  system,  the  latter  of  which 
had originally been developed for the U. S. Air Force.  Mead was  interested  in  the  inkjet  printing  technology  because  it 

would  have  complemented  Mead's  paper  business,  but  the information retrieval system proved to be the more valuable 
asset.  Over the course of many years, Mead developed that asset  into  the  electronic  research  service  now  known  as 
Lexis/Nexis  (Lexis).  In 1994,  it  sold Lexis  to  a third  party for  approximately  $1.5  billion,  realizing  just  over  $1  billion 
in  capital gain,  which  Mead used  to  repurchase  stock,  retire debt, and pay taxes. 

Mead  did  not  report  any  of  this  gain  as  business  income on its Illinois tax returns for 1994.  It took the position that 
the gain qualified as nonbusiness income that should be allo-
cated  to  Mead's  domiciliary  State,  Ohio,  under  Illinois'  In-come  Tax  Act  (ITA).  See  Ill.  Comp.  Stat.,  ch.  35,  $ 5/303(a) 

(West  1994).  The  State  audited  Mead's  returns  and  issued a  notice  of  deficiency.  According  to  the  State,  the  ITA  re-
quired Mead to treat the capital gain as business income sub-ject to apportionment by Illinois.

2  The State assessed Mead

d424b5.htm  (as visited Apr.  1,  2008,  and available in  Clerk  of Court's  case 
file); App. 9. 

2 When  the  sale  of  Lexis  occurred  in  1994,  the  ITA  defined  "business 

income"  as  "income  arising  from  transactions  and  activity  in  the  regular 
course of the taxpayer's trade or business," as well as "income from tangi-
ble and intangible property if the acquisition, management, and disposition 
of the property constitute integral parts of the taxpayer's regular trade or 
business  operations."  Ill.  Comp.  Stat.,  ch.  35,  $ 5/1501(a)(1)  (West  1994). 
This  language  mirrors  the  definition  of  "business  income"  in  the  Uniform 
Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act (UDITPA).  See UDITPA $ 1(a)

Opinion of the Court 
with approximately $4 million in additional tax and penalties. Mead paid that amount under protest and then filed this law-

suit in state court. The  case  was  tried  to  the  bench.  Although  the  court 

admitted  expert  testimony,  reports,  and  other  exhibits  into evidence,  see  App.  D  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  29a-34a,  the  parties' 
stipulations  supplied  most  of  the  evidence  of  record  re-garding Mead's relationship with Lexis, see App. 9-20.  We 
summarize those stipulations here. 

B 
Lexis was launched in 1973.  For the first few years it was in  business,  it  lost  money,  and  Mead  had  to  keep  it  afloat 

with additional capital contributions.  By the  late 1970's,  as more attorneys began to use Lexis, the service finally turned 
a  profit.  That  profit  quickly  became  substantial.  Between 1988  and  1993,  Lexis  made  more  than  $800  million  of  the 
$3.8  billion  in  Illinois  income  that  Mead  reported.  Lexis also accounted for $680 million of the $4.5 billion in business 
expense  deductions  that  Mead  claimed  from  Illinois  during that period. 

Lexis  was  subject  to  Mead's  oversight,  but  Mead  did  not manage  its  day-to-day  affairs.  Mead  was  headquartered  in 
Ohio,  while  a  separate  management  team  ran  Lexis  out  of its headquarters in Illinois.  The two businesses maintained 
separate  manufacturing,  sales,  and  distribution  facilities,  as well  as  separate  accounting,  legal,  human  resources,  credit 
and collections, purchasing, and marketing departments. 

(2002);  see  also  $ 9  (subjecting  "[a]ll  business  income"  to  apportionment). 
In 2004, the Illinois General Assembly amended the definition of "business 
income"  to  "all  income  that  may  be  treated  as  apportionable  business  in-
come  under  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States."  Pub.  Act  93-840,

standard for apportionment).

Opinion of the Court  

Mead's involvement was generally limited to approving Lexis'  annual  business  plan  and  any  significant  corporate 

transactions  (such as capital expenditures,  financings, merg-ers and acquisitions, or joint ventures)  that Lexis wished to 
undertake.  In at least one case, Mead procured new equip-ment  for  Lexis by  purchasing  the  equipment  for  its  own  ac-
count  and  then  leasing  it  to  Lexis.  Mead  also  managed 
Lexis'  free  cash,  which  was  swept  nightly  from  Lexis'  bank accounts into an account maintained by Mead.  The cash was 

reinvested  in  Lexis'  business,  but  Mead  decided  how  to invest it. 

Neither  business  was required to  purchase  goods or serv-
ices  from  the  other.  Lexis,  for  example,  was  not  required 
to  purchase  its  paper  supply  from  Mead,  and  indeed  Lexis 
purchased  most  of  its  paper  from  other  suppliers.  Neither 
received  any  discount  on  goods  or  services  purchased  from 
the other, and neither was a significant customer of the other. 

Lexis  was  incorporated  as  one  of  Mead's  wholly  owned 
subsidiaries  until  1980,  when  it  was  merged  into  Mead  and 
became  one  of  Mead's  divisions.  Mead  engineered  the 
merger so that it could offset its income with Lexis' net oper-
ating  loss  carryforwards.  Lexis  was  separately  reincorpo-
rated  in  1985  before  being  merged  back  into  Mead  in  1993. 
Once  again,  tax  considerations  motivated  each  transaction. 
Mead  also  treated  Lexis  as  a  unitary  business  in  its  con-
solidated  Illinois  returns  for  the  years  1988  through  1994, 
though  it  did  so  at  the  State's  insistence  and  then  only  to 
avoid litigation. 

Lexis was listed as one of Mead's "business segment[s]" in 
at  least  some  of  its  annual  reports  and  regulatory  filings. 
Mead described itself in those reports and filings as "engaged 
in the electronic publishing business" and touted itself as the 
"developer  of  the  world's  leading  electronic  information  re-
trieval  services  for  law,  patents,  accounting,  finance,  news 
and  business  information."  Id.,  at  93,  59;  App.  D  to  Pet.

Opinion of the Court 

C 
Based  on  the  stipulated  facts  and  the  other  exhibits  and expert  testimony  received  into  evidence,  the  Circuit  Court 

of Cook County concluded that Lexis and Mead did not  con-stitute  a  unitary  business.  The  trial  court  reasoned  that 
Lexis and Mead could not be unitary  because they were not functionally integrated or centrally managed and enjoyed no 
economies  of  scale.  Id.,  at  35a-36a,  39a.  The  court  never-theless  concluded  that  the  State  could  tax  an  apportioned 
share of Mead's capital gain because Lexis served an "opera-tional purpose" in Mead's business: 

"Lexis/Nexis was considered in the strategic planning of Mead,  particularly  in  the  allocation  of  resources.  The 
operational purpose allowed Mead to limit the growth of Lexis/Nexis  if  only  to  limit  its  ability  to  expand  or  to 
contract  through  its  control  of  its  capital  investment." Id., at 38a-39a. 

The  Appellate  Court  of  Illinois  affirmed.  Mead  Corp.  v. 
Department  of  Revenue,  371  Ill.  App.  3d  108,  861  N.  E.  2d 1131 (2007).  The court cited several factors as evidence that 

Lexis  served  an  operational  function  in  Mead's  business: (1) Lexis was wholly owned by Mead; (2) Mead had exercised 
its control over Lexis in various ways, such as manipulating its  corporate  form,  approving  significant  capital  expendi-
tures, and retaining tax benefits and control over Lexis' free cash; and  (3)  Mead had described itself in  its annual reports 
and  regulatory  filings  as  engaged  in  electronic  publishing and  as  the  developer  of  the  world's  leading  information  re-
trieval  service.  See  id.,  at  111-112,  861  N.  E.  2d,  at  1135- 1136.  Because  the  court  found  that  Lexis served  an  opera-
tional  function  in  Mead's  business,  it  did  not  address  the question whether Mead and Lexis formed a unitary business. 
See id., at 117-118, 861 N. E. 2d, at 1140. The  Supreme  Court  of  Illinois  denied  review  in  January

Opinion of the Court 

609,  862  N.  E.  2d  235  (Table).  We  granted  certiorari.  551 
U. S. 1189 (2007). 

II 

Petitioner contends that the trial court properly found that 
Lexis  and  Mead  were  not  unitary  and  that  the  Appellate 
Court  of  Illinois  erred  in  concluding  that  Lexis  served  an 
operational  function  in  Mead's  business.  According  to  peti-
tioner, the exception for apportionment of income from non-
unitary  businesses  serving  an  operational  function  is  a  nar-
row one that does not reach a purely passive investment such 
as  Lexis.  We  perceive  a  more  fundamental  error  in  the 
state courts' reasoning.  In our view, the state courts erred 
in  considering  whether  Lexis  served  an  "operational  pur-
pose"  in  Mead's  business  after  determining  that  Lexis  and 
Mead were not unitary.

The Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause impose 
distinct  but  parallel  limitations  on  a  State's  power  to  tax 
out-of-state activities.  See Quill Corp. v.  North Dakota, 504

ments  is  " `whether  the  taxing  power  exerted  by  the  state bears fiscal relation to protection, opportunities and benefits 

given  by the state' "--that  is, " `whether the  state has  given anything  for  which  it  can  ask  return.' "  ASARCO  Inc.  v. 
Idaho  Tax  Comm'n,  458  U. S.  307,  315  (1982)  (quoting  Wis-
consin v.  J. C. Penney Co., 311 U. S. 435, 444 (1940)). Where,  as  here,  there  is  no  dispute  that  the  taxpayer  has 

done  some  business  in  the  taxing  State,  the  inquiry  shifts from  whether  the  State  may  tax  to  what  it  may  tax. 
Cf.  Allied-Signal,  504  U. S.,  at  778  (distinguishing  Quill Corp., supra).  To answer that question, we have developed 
the unitary business principle.  Under that principle, a State need  not  "isolate  the  intrastate  income-producing  activities 
from  the  rest  of  the  business"  but  "may  tax  an  apportioned sum  of  the  corporation's  multistate  business  if  the  business 
is  unitary."  Allied-Signal,  supra,  at  772;  accord,  HuntWesson, 528 U. S., at 460; Exxon Corp. v.  Department of Rev-enue  of  Wis.,  447  U. S.  207,  224  (1980);  Mobil  Oil  Corp., 

supra, at 442; cf. 1 J. Hellerstein & W. Hellerstein, State Tax-ation  || 8.07[1],  p.  8-61  (3d  ed.  2001-2005)  (hereinafter  Hel-
lerstein & Hellerstein).  The court must determine whether "intrastate  and  extrastate  activities  formed  part  of  a  single 
unitary  business,"  Mobil  Oil  Corp.,  supra,  at  438-439,  or whether  the  out-of-state  values  that  the  State  seeks  to  tax 
" `derive[d]  from  "unrelated  business  activity"  which  con-stitutes  a  "discrete  business  enterprise," ' " 

Allied-Signal, supra,  at  773  (quoting  Exxon  Corp.,  supra,  at  224,  in  turn 

quoting  Mobil  Oil  Corp.,  supra,  at  439,  442;  alteration  in original).  We  traced the  history of this venerable  principle 
in  Allied-Signal,  supra,  at  778-783,  and,  because  it  figures prominently in this case, we retrace it briefly here.

With  the  coming  of  the  Industrial  Revolution  in  the  19th century,  the  United  States  witnessed  the  emergence  of  its

Opinion of the Court  

telegraph, and express companies presented state taxing au-thorities  with  a  novel  problem:  A  State  often  cannot  tax  its 

fair  share  of  the  value  of  a  multistate  business  by  simply taxing  the  capital  within  its  borders.  The  whole  of  the  en-
terprise is generally more valuable than the sum of its parts; were  it  not,  its  owners  would  simply  liquidate  it  and  sell  it 
off  in  pieces.  As  we  observed  in  1876,  "[t]he  track  of  the 
road  is  but  one  track  from  one  end  of  it  to  the  other,  and, except in its use as one track, is of little value." 

State Rail-
road Tax Cases, 92 U. S. 575, 608. The  unitary  business  principle  addressed  this  problem  by 

shifting  the  constitutional  inquiry  from  the  niceties  of  geo-
graphic  accounting  to  the  determination  of  the  taxpayer's 
business unit.  If the  value the State wished to tax derived 
from  a  "unitary  business"  operated  within  and  without  the 
State, the State could tax an apportioned share of the value 
of that business instead of isolating the value attributable to 
the operation of the business within the State.  E. g., Exxon 
Corp.,  supra,  at  223  (citing  Moorman  Mfg.  Co.,  supra,  at 
273).  Conversely,  if  the  value  the  State  wished  to  tax  de-
rived from a "discrete business enterprise," Mobil Oil Corp., 
supra,  at  439,  then  the  State  could  not  tax  even  an  appor-
tioned  share  of  that  value.  E. g.,  Container  Corp.,  supra, 
at 165-166. 

We  recognized  as  early  as  1876  that  the  Due  Process 
Clause did not require the States to assess trackage "in each 
county  where  it  lies  according  to  its  value  there."  State 
Railroad  Tax  Cases,  92  U. S.,  at  608.  We  went  so  far  as  to 
opine  that  "[i]t  may  well  be  doubted  whether  any  better 
mode  of  determining  the  value  of  that  portion  of  the  track 
within any one county has been devised than to ascertain the 
value  of  the  whole  road,  and  apportion  the  value  within  the 
county by its relative length to the whole."  Ibid.  We gen-
eralized the rule of the  State Railroad Tax Cases in Adams 
Express  Co.  v.  Ohio  State  Auditor,  165  U. S.  194  (1897). 
There  we  held  that  apportionment  could  permissibly  be  ap-

plied to a multistate business lacking the "physical unity" of wires  or  rails  but  exhibiting  the  "same  unity  in  the  use  of 

the entire property for the specific purpose," with "the same elements  of  value  arising  from  such  use." 

Id.,  at  221.  We 
extended the  reach of the unitary  business principle further still in later cases, when we relied on it to justify the taxation 

by apportionment of net income, dividends, capital gain, and 
other intangibles.  See Underwood Typewriter Co. v.  Cham-
berlain,  254  U. S.  113,  117,  120-121  (1920)  (net  income  tax); 
Bass,  Ratcliff  &  Gretton,  Ltd.  v.  State  Tax  Comm'n,  266 U. S.  271,  277,  280,  282-283  (1924)  (franchise  tax); 

J.  C.  Pen-
ney Co., supra, at 443-445 (tax on the "privilege of declaring 
dividends"); cf. Allied-Signal, supra, at 780 ("[F]or constitu-
tional  purposes  capital  gains  should  be  treated  as  no  differ-
ent  from  dividends");  see  also  1  Hellerstein  &  Hellerstein 
|| 8.07[1] (summarizing this history). 

As the unitary business principle has evolved in step with 
American  enterprise,  courts  have  sometimes  found  it  diffi-
cult to identify exactly when a business is unitary.  We con-
fronted  this  problem  most  recently  in  Allied-Signal.  The 
taxpayer  there,  a  multistate enterprise,  had realized  capital 
gain on the disposition of its minority investment in another 
business.  The  parties'  stipulation  left  little  doubt  that  the 
taxpayer  and  its  investee  were  not  unitary.  See  504  U. S., 
at  774  (observing  that  "the  question  whether  the  business 
can  be  called  `unitary' . . . is all  but  controlled  by  the  terms 
of  a  stipulation").  The  record  revealed,  however,  that  the 
taxpayer  had  used  the  proceeds  from  the  liquidated  invest-
ment  in  an  ultimately  unsuccessful  bid  to  purchase  a  new 
asset  that  would  have  been  used  in  its  unitary  business. 
See  id.,  at  776-777.  From  that  wrinkle  in  the  record,  the 
New  Jersey  Supreme  Court  concluded  that  the  taxpayer's 
minority interest had represented nothing more than a tem-
porary  investment  of  working  capital  awaiting  deployment 
in  the  taxpayer's  unitary  business.  See  Bendix  Corp.  v. 
Director,  Div.  of  Taxation,  125  N.  J.  20,  37,  592  A.  2d  536,

Opinion of the Court  

545  (1991).  The  State  went  even  further.  It  argued  that, because  there  could  be  "no  logical  distinction  between 

short-term investment of working capital, which all concede is apportionable, . . . and  all  other investments," the unitary 
business  principle  was  outdated  and  should  be  jettisoned. 504 U. S., at 784. 

We  rejected  both  contentions.  We  concluded  that  "the unitary 

business  principle  is  not  so  inflexible  that  as  new methods  of finance  and new  forms  of business  evolve  it  can-

not  be  modified  or  supplemented  where  appropriate."  Id., at  786;  see  also 

id.,  at  785  ("If  lower  courts  have  reached 
divergent  results  in  applying  the  unitary  business  principle to  different  factual  circumstances,  that  is  because,  as  we 

have said,  any number  of variations  on the  unitary  business theme `are logically consistent with the underlying principles 
motivating  the  approach' "  (quoting  Container  Corp.,  463 U. S., at 167)).

3  We  explained  that situations  could occur in 

which  apportionment  might  be  constitutional  even  though 
"the payee and the payor [were] not . . . engaged in the same 
unitary business."  504 U. S., at 787.  It was in that context 
that we  observed that  an asset could form part of a taxpay-
er's unitary business if it served an "operational rather than 
an  investment  function"  in  that  business.  Ibid.  "Hence, 
for  example,  a  State  may  include  within  the  apportionable 
income  of  a  nondomiciliary  corporation  the  interest  earned 
on  short-term  deposits  in  a  bank  located  in  another  State  if 
that income forms part of the working capital of the corpora-
tion's unitary business, notwithstanding the absence of a uni-
tary  relationship  between  the  corporation  and  the  bank." 

3 The dissent agreed that the unitary business principle remained sound, 
504 U. S., at 790 (opinion of O'Connor, J.), but found merit in New Jersey's 
premise  (and  the  New  Jersey  Supreme  Court's  conclusion)  that  no  logical 
distinction  could  be  drawn  between  short- or  long-term  investments  for 
purposes  of  unitary  analysis,  id.,  at  793  ("Any  distinction  between  short-
term  and  long-term  investments  cannot  be  of  constitutional  dimension"). 
We need not revisit that question here.

Opinion of the Court 
Id.,  at  787-788.  We  observed  that  we  had  made  the  same point in Container Corp., where we noted that "capital trans-

actions can serve either an investment function or an opera-tional  function."  463  U. S.,  at  180,  n.  19;  cf.  Corn  Products 
Refining  Co.  v.  Commissioner,  350  U. S.  46,  50  (1955)  (con-cluding  that  corn  futures  contracts  in  the  hands  of  a  corn 
refiner  seeking  to  hedge  itself  against  increases  in  corn prices  are  operational  rather  than  capital  assets),  cited  in 
Container Corp., supra, at 180, n. 19. 

C 
As the foregoing history confirms, our references to "oper-ational function" in 

Container Corp. and Allied-Signal were not intended to modify the unitary business principle by add-

ing a new ground for apportionment.  The concept of opera-tional function simply recognizes that an asset can be a part 
of  a  taxpayer's  unitary  business  even  if  what  we  may  term a  "unitary  relationship"  does  not  exist  between  the  "payor 
and  payee."  See  Allied-Signal,  supra,  at  791-792  (O'Con-nor,  J.,  dissenting);  Hellerstein,  State  Taxation  of  Corporate 
Income From Intangibles: Allied-Signal and Beyond, 48 Tax L. Rev. 739, 790 (1993) (hereinafter Hellerstein).  In the ex-
ample  given  in  Allied-Signal,  the  taxpayer  was  not  unitary with  its  banker,  but  the  taxpayer's  deposits  (which  repre-
sented  working  capital  and  thus  operational  assets)  were clearly unitary with the taxpayer's business.  In Corn Prod-
ucts, the taxpayer was not unitary with the counterparty to its hedge, but the taxpayer's futures contracts (which served 
to hedge against the risk of an increase in the price of a key cost input) were likewise clearly unitary with the taxpayer's 
business.  In  each  case,  the  "payor"  was  not  a  unitary  part of the taxpayer's business, but the relevant asset was.  The 
conclusion that the asset served an operational function was merely  instrumental  to  the  constitutionally  relevant  conclu-
sion  that  the  asset  was  a  unitary  part  of  the  business  being conducted in the taxing State rather than a discrete asset to

which  the  State  had  no  claim.  Our  decisions  in  Container Corp.  and  Allied-Signal  did  not  announce  a  new  ground  for 

the  constitutional  apportionment  of  extrastate  values  in  the absence of a unitary business.  Because the Appellate Court 
of  Illinois  interpreted  those  decisions  to  the  contrary,  it erred. 

Where,  as  here,  the  asset  in  question  is  another  business, we  have  described  the  "hallmarks"  of  a unitary  relationship 
as functional integration, centralized management, and econ-omies of scale.  See 

Mobil Oil Corp., 445 U. S., at 438 (citing Butler Brothers v.  McColgan, 315 U. S. 501, 506-508 (1942)); 

see  also  Allied-Signal,  supra,  at  783  (same);  Container Corp., supra, at 179 (same); F.  W.  Woolworth  Co.  v.  Taxation 
and Revenue Dept. of N. M., 458 U. S. 354, 364 (1982) (same). The  trial  court  found  each  of  these  hallmarks  lacking  and 
concluded  that  Lexis  was  not  a  unitary  part  of  Mead's  busi-ness.  The appellate court, however, made no such determi-
nation.  Relying on its operational function test, it reserved judgment on whether Mead and Lexis formed a unitary busi-
ness.  The appellate court may take up that question on re-mand, and we express no opinion on it now. 

III 
The State and its amici argue that vacatur is not required because the judgment of the Appellate Court of Illinois may 

be  affirmed  on  an  alternative  ground.  They  contend  that the  record  amply  demonstrates  that  Lexis  did  substantial 
business  in  Illinois  and  that  Lexis'  own  contacts  with  the State  suffice  to  justify  the  apportionment  of  Mead's  capital 
gain.  See  Brief  for  Respondents  18-25,  46-49;  Brief  for Multistate  Tax  Commission  as 

Amicus  Curiae  19-29.  The 
State  and  its  amici  invite  us  to  recognize  a  new  ground  for the constitutional apportionment of intangibles based on the 

taxing  State's  contacts  with  the  capital  asset  rather  than the taxpayer.

Opinion of the Court 
We  decline  this  invitation  because  the  question  that  the State and its amici call upon us to answer was neither raised 

nor  passed  upon  in  the  state  courts.  It  also  was  not  ad-dressed in the State's brief in opposition to the petition.  We 
typically  will  not  address  a  question  under  these  circum-stances  even  if  the  answer  would  afford  an  alternative

ficult to regard a practice as "objectively intolerable" when it is in fact 
widely  tolerated.  Probative  but  not  conclusive  in  this  regard  is  the 
consensus  among  the  Federal  Government  and  the  States  that  have 
adopted  lethal  injection  and  the  specific  three-drug  combination  Ken-
tucky uses.  Pp. 53-54. 

(b)  In light of the safeguards Kentucky's protocol puts in place, the 
risks  of  administering  an  inadequate  sodium  thiopental  dose  identified 
by  petitioners  are  not  so  substantial  or  imminent  as  to  amount  to  an 
Eighth  Amendment violation.  The charge  that Kentucky employs un-
trained personnel unqualified to calculate and mix an adequate dose was 
answered by the state trial court's finding, substantiated by expert tes-
timony, that there would be minimal risk of improper mixing if the man-
ufacturers' thiopental package insert instructions were followed.  Like-
wise,  the  IV  line  problems  alleged  by  petitioners  do  not  establish  a 
sufficiently  substantial  risk  because  IV  team  members  must  have  at 
least  one  year  of  relevant  professional  experience,  and  the  presence  of 
the warden and deputy warden in the execution chamber allows them to 
watch for IV problems.  If an insufficient dose is initially administered 
through  the  primary  IV  site,  an  additional  dose  can  be  given  through 
the  secondary  site  before  the  last  two  drugs  are  injected.  Pp.  54-56. 

(c)  Nor does Kentucky's failure to adopt petitioners' proposed alter-
natives demonstrate that the state execution procedure is cruel and un-
usual.  Kentucky's  continued  use  of  the  three-drug  protocol  cannot  be

quantity of cocaine base ordinarily carries a mandatory mini-mum  sentence  of  ten  years.  $ 841(b)(1)(A).  The  minimum 

sentence increases to 20 years, however, if the crime follows 
a prior conviction for a "felony drug offense."  Ibid.

The drafting history of the  CSA  reinforces our reading  of $ 802(44) as the exclusive definition of "felony drug offense." 
In  1988,  Congress  first  used  the  term  "felony  drug  offense" to describe the type of prior conviction that would trigger a 
20-year  mandatory  minimum  sentence  under  $ 841(b)(1)(A). See  National  Narcotics  Leadership  Act,  Pub.  L.  100-690, 

$ 6452(a),  102  Stat.  4371.  The  1988  definition  of  the  term was placed within $ 841(b)(1)(A) itself; the definition covered 
"an  offense  that  is  a  felony  under  any  .  .  .  Federal  law  .  .  . or  .  .  .  any  law  of  a  State  or  a  foreign  country"  prohibiting 
or  restricting  conduct  relating  to  certain  types  of  drugs. $ 6452(a)(2), ibid.

his reading of the statute "the language that Congress added [in  1994]  has  very  little  practical  effect,"  but  defends  his

scope  these  kinds  of  crimes,  far  removed  as  they  are  from the deliberate kind of behavior associated with violent crim-
inal  use  of  firearms.  The  statute's  use  of  examples  (and the  other  considerations  we  have  mentioned)  indicate  the 
contrary. The  dissent's  approach,  on  the  other  hand,  would  likely 
include  these  crimes  within  the  statutory  definition  of  "vio-
lent  felony,"  along  with  any  other  crime  that  can  be  said  to present  a  " `potential  risk  of  physical  injury.' "

and it safeguards evidence and enables officers to conduct an in-custody 
investigation.  A State's choice of a more restrictive search-and-seizure 
policy does not render less restrictive ones unreasonable, and hence un-
constitutional.  While States are free to require their officers to engage 
in  nuanced  determinations  of  the  need  for  arrest  as  a  matter  of  their 
own  law,  the  Fourth  Amendment  should  reflect  administrable  bright-
line  rules.  Incorporating  state  arrest  rules  into  the  Constitution 
would  make  Fourth  Amendment  protections  as  complex  as  the  under-
lying  state  law,  and  variable  from  place  to  place  and  time  to  time. 
Pp. 173-176. 

(d)  The Court rejects Moore's argument that even if the Constitution 
allowed his arrest, it did not allow the arresting officers to search him. 
Officers  may  perform  searches  incident  to  constitutionally  permissible 
arrests in order to ensure their safety and safeguard evidence.  United

that Moore's license was in fact suspended, and arrested him for the misdemeanor of driving on a suspended license, which 

is  punishable  under  Virginia  law  by  a  year  in  jail  and  a $2,500  fine,  Va.  Code  Ann.  $$ 18.2-11  (Lexis  2004),  18.2-272 
(Supp.  2007),  46.2-301(C)  (2005).  The  officers  subsequently searched Moore and found that he was carrying 16 grams of 
crack  cocaine  and  $516  in  cash.1  See  272  Va.  717,  636  S.  E. 
2d 395 (2006); 45 Va. App. 146, 609 S. E. 2d 74 (2005). Under  state  law,  the  officers  should  have  issued  Moore  a 

summons instead of arresting him.  Driving on a suspended license,  like  some  other  misdemeanors,  is  not  an  arrestable 
offense except as to those who "fail or refuse to discontinue" the violation, and those whom the officer reasonably believes 
to be likely to disregard a summons, or likely to harm them-selves  or  others.  Va.  Code  Ann.  $ 19.2-74  (Lexis  2004). 
The intermediate appellate court found none of these circum-stances applicable, and Virginia did not appeal that determi-
nation.  See  272  Va.,  at  720,  n.  3,  636  S.  E.  2d,  at  396-397, 
n. 3.  Virginia also permits arrest for driving on a suspended 
license  in  jurisdictions  where  "prior  general  approval  has 
been  granted  by  order  of  the  general  district  court,"  Va. 
Code  Ann.  $ 46.2-936;  Virginia  has  never  claimed  such  ap-
proval was in effect in the county where Moore was arrested. 

Moore  was  charged  with  possessing  cocaine  with  the 
intent  to  distribute  it  in  violation  of  Virginia  law.  He  filed 
a  pretrial  motion  to  suppress  the  evidence  from  the  ar-
rest search.  Virginia law does not,  as a general matter, re-
quire  suppression  of  evidence  obtained  in  violation  of 
state  law.  See  45  Va.  App.,  at  160-162,  609  S.  E.  2d,  at  82 

1 The arresting officers did not perform a search incident to arrest imme-
diately upon taking Moore into custody, because each of them mistakenly 
believed  that  the  other  had  done  so.  App.  54-55;  see  also  id.,

182  CRAWFORD  v.  MARION  COUNTY  ELECTION  BD. 

Syllabus 
that  the  fraud  SEA  483  addresses--in-person  voter  impersonation  at 
polling places--has actually occurred in Indiana, such fraud has occurred 
in  other  parts  of  the  country,  and  Indiana's  own  experience  with  voter 
fraud  in  a  2003  mayoral  primary  demonstrates  a  real  risk  that  voter 
fraud could affect a close election's outcome.  There is no question about 
the legitimacy or importance of a State's interest in counting only eligi-
ble voters' votes.  Finally, Indiana's interest in protecting public confi-
dence  in  elections,  while  closely  related  to  its  interest  in  preventing 
voter  fraud,  has  independent  significance,  because  such  confidence  en-
courages  citizen  participation  in  the  democratic  process.  Pp.  191-197. 

(c)  The  relevant  burdens  here  are  those  imposed  on  eligible  voters 
who lack photo identification cards that comply with SEA 483.  Because 
Indiana's  cards  are  free,  the  inconvenience  of  going  to  the  Bureau  of 
Motor  Vehicles, gathering required documents, and posing for a  photo-
graph does not qualify as a substantial burden on most voters' right to 
vote,  or represent  a significant  increase over  the usual  burdens of  vot-
ing.  The severity of the somewhat heavier burden that may be placed 
on a limited number of persons--e. g., elderly persons born out of State, 
who  may  have  difficulty  obtaining  a  birth  certificate--is  mitigated  by 
the fact that eligible voters without photo identification may cast provi-
sional ballots that will be counted if they execute the required affidavit 
at the circuit court clerk's office.  Even assuming that the burden may 
not be justified as to a few voters, that conclusion is by no means suffi-
cient to establish petitioners' right to the relief they seek.  Pp. 197-200. 

(d)  Petitioners bear a heavy burden of persuasion in seeking to invali-
date  SEA  483  in  all  its  applications.  This  Court's  reasoning  in  Wash-
ington  State  Grange  v.  Washington  State  Republican  Party,  552  U. S. 
442,  applies  with  added  force  here.  Petitioners  argue  that  Indiana's 
interests do not justify the burden imposed on voters who cannot afford 
or  obtain  a  birth  certificate  and  who  must  make  a  second  trip  to  the 
circuit court clerk's office, but it is not possible to quantify, based on the 
evidence in the record, either that burden's magnitude or the portion of 
the  burden  that  is  fully  justified.  A  facial  challenge  must  fail  where 
the  statute  has  a  " `plainly  legitimate  sweep.' "  Id.,  at  449.  When 
considering  SEA  483's  broad  application  to  all  Indiana  voters,  it  "im-
poses  only  a  limited  burden  on  voters'  rights."  Burdick  v.  Takushi, 
504  U. S.  428,  439.  The  "precise  interests"  advanced  by  Indiana  are 
therefore  sufficient  to  defeat  petitioners'  facial  challenge.  Id.,  at  434. 
Pp. 200-203. 

(e)  Valid  neutral  justifications  for  a  nondiscriminatory  law,  such  as 
SEA  483,  should  not  be  disregarded  simply  because  partisan  interests 
may  have  provided  one  motivation  for  the  votes  of  individual  legisla-
tors.  Pp. 203-204.

Opinion of the Court 
There are instances in federal criminal proceedings where the procedural requisites for consent are specified and a right 

cannot  be  waived  except  with  a  defendant's  own  informed consent.  Under  Federal  Rule  of  Criminal  Procedure  11(b), 
for example, the  district  court  is  required,  as a  precondition to  acceptance  of  a  guilty  plea,  to  inform  the  defendant  in 
person  of  the  specified  rights  he  or  she  may  claim  in  a  full 
criminal  trial  and  then  verify  that  the  plea  is  voluntary  by addressing  the  defendant.  The  requirement  is  satisfied  by 

a colloquy between judge and defendant, reviewing all of the rights listed in Rule 11. 

Statutes may also address this subject.  Under 18 U. S. C. $ 3401(b),  for  example,  a  magistrate  judge  may  preside  over 
the  whole  trial  and  sentencing  in  a  misdemeanor  case  but only  with  the  express,  personal  consent  of  the  defendant. 
The provision requires that the magistrate judge 

"carefully  explain  to  the  defendant  that  he  has  a  right 
to  trial,  judgment,  and  sentencing  by  a  district  judge and  that  he  may  have  a  right  to  trial  by  jury  before  a 

district  judge  or  magistrate  judge.  The  magistrate judge may not proceed to try the case unless the defend-
ant,  after  such  explanation,  expressly  consents  to  be tried before the magistrate judge and expressly and spe-
cifically waives trial, judgment, and sentencing by a dis-
trict judge.  Any such consent and waiver shall be made in writing or orally on the record." 

The controlling statute in this case has a different design, 
however.  Title  28  U. S. C.  $ 636(b)(3)  does  not  state  that consent to  preside  over felony

Opinion of the Court 
as used in the statute.  Because respondent's carrying of the explosives was contemporaneous with his violation of $ 1001, 

he carried them "during" that violation. 

II 
The history  of the statute we construe today  further sup-ports our conclusion that Congress did not intend to require 

the  Government  to  establish  a  relationship  between  the  ex-plosive  carried  and  the  underlying  felony.  Congress  origi-
nally enacted $ 844(h)(2)  as part of its  "Regulation of Explo-sives"  in  Title  XI  of  the  Organized  Crime  Control  Act  of 
1970,  84  Stat.  957.  The  provision  was  modeled  after  a  por-tion of the Gun Control Act of 1968, $ 102, 82 Stat. 1224, codi-
fied,  as  amended,  at  18  U. S. C.  $ 924(c)  (2000  ed.  and  Supp. V).  The  earlier  statute  mandated  at  least  1  and  no  more 
than  10  years'  imprisonment  for  any  person  who  "carries  a firearm  unlawfully  during  the  commission  of  any  felony 
which  may  be  prosecuted  in  a  court  of  the  United  States." 18  U. S. C.  $ 924(c)(2)  (1964  ed.,  Supp.  IV).  Except  for  the 
word "explosive" in $ 844(h)(2), instead of the word "firearm" in  $ 924(c)(2),  the  two  provisions  as  originally  enacted  were 
identical. In  1984,  Congress  redrafted  the  firearm  statute;  it  in-
creased the penalties attached to the provision and, most sig-nificantly  for  our  purposes,  deleted  the  word  "unlawfully" 
and inserted the words "and in relation to" immediately after the  word  "during."  $ 1005(a),  98  Stat.  2138.  Reviewing  a 
conviction  for  an  offense  that  was  committed  before  the amendment  but  not  decided  on  appeal  until  after  its  enact-
ment, the Ninth Circuit held that the original version of the firearm  statute  had  implicitly  included  the  "in  relation  to" 
requirement  that  was  expressly  added  while  the  case  was pending on appeal.  As then-Judge Kennedy explained: 

"The  statute  as  written  when  Stewart  committed  the offense provided in pertinent part that it was a crime to 
`carr[y]  a  firearm  unlawfully  during  the  commission  of any felony . . . .'  18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(2) (1982).  In 1984,

Opinion of the Court 
Under this heading the Eleventh Circuit also thought that 
the statute could apply to someone who subjectively believes 
that an innocuous picture of a child is "lascivious."  (Clause 
(v) of the  definition of "sexually explicit  conduct" is  "lascivi-
ous  exhibition  of  the  genitals  or  pubic  area  of  any  person." 

$ 2256(2)(A)  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  V).)  That  is  not  so.  The 
defendant  must  believe  that  the  picture  contains  certain 
material,  and  that  material  in  fact  (and  not  merely  in  his 
estimation)  must  meet  the  statutory  definition.  Where  the 
material  at  issue  is  a  harmless  picture  of  a  child  in  a  bath-
tub  and  the  defendant,  knowing  that  material,  erroneously 
believes  that  it  constitutes  a  "lascivious  exhibition  of  the 
genitals," the statute has no application.

government's interest in preventing the distribution of mate-rials  that  constitute  "a  permanent  record"  of  the  children's

(b)  United Haulers provides a firm basis for reversal here.  The logic 
that a government function is not susceptible to standard dormant Com-
merce Clause scrutiny because it is likely motivated by legitimate objec-
tives  distinct  from  simple  economic  protectionism  applies  with  even 
greater  force  to  laws  favoring  a  State's  municipal  bonds,  since  issuing 
debt  securities  to  pay  for  public  projects  is  a  quintessentially  public 
function, with a venerable history.  Bond proceeds are a way to shoul-
der the cardinal civic responsibilities listed in United Haulers: protect-
ing  citizens'  health,  safety,  and  welfare.  And  United  Haulers'  appre-
hension  about  "unprecedented  .  .  .  interference"  with  a  traditional 
government function is warranted here, where respondents would have 
this  Court  invalidate  a  century-old  taxing  practice  presently  employed 
by 41 States and supported by all.  In fact, emphasizing an enterprise's 
public character is just one step in addressing the fundamental element 
of dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence that "any notion of discrim-
ination  assumes  a  comparison  of  substantially  similar  entities,"  550 
U. S., at 342.  Viewed through the lens of Bonaparte v.  Tax  Court,  104 
U. S.  592,  there  is  no  forbidden  discrimination  because  Kentucky,  as  a 
public  entity, does  not  have  to  treat  itself  as  being "substantially  simi-
lar" to other bond issuers in the market.  Pp. 341-343. 

(c)  A look at the specific markets in which the exemption's effects are 
felt confirms that no traditionally forbidden discrimination is underway 
and  points  to  the  tax  policy's  distinctive  character.  In  both  the  inter-
state  market  as  most  broadly  conceived--issuers  and  holders  of  all 
fixed-income  securities--and  the  more  specialized  market--commerce 
solely in federally tax-exempt municipal bonds, often conducted through 
interstate municipal bond funds--nearly every taxing State believes its 
public  interests  are  served  by  the  same  tax-and-exemption  feature 
which  is supported  in  this  Court  by  every  State.  These  facts  suggest 
that no State perceives any local advantage or disadvantage beyond the 
permissible ones open to a government and to those who deal with that 
government when it enters the market.  An equally significant percep-
tion emerges from examining the market for municipal bonds within the 
issuing State, a large proportion of which market is managed by one or 
more single-state funds.  An important feature of such markets is that 
intrastate  funds  absorb  securities  issued  by  smaller  or  lesser  known 
municipalities  that  interstate  markets  tend  to  ignore.  Many  single-
state funds would likely disappear if the current differential tax schemes 
were  upset,  and  there  is  no  suggestion  that  the  interstate  markets 
would  welcome the  weaker municipal issues  that would  lose their  local 
market homes after a Davis victory.  Financing for long-term municipal

improvements would thus change radically if the differential tax feature 
disappeared.  The fact that the differential tax scheme is critical to the 
operation  of  an  identifiable  segment  of  the  current  municipal  financial 
market demonstrates that the States' unanimous desire to preserve the 
scheme is  a  far  cry from  the private  protectionism  that  has driven  the 
dormant Commerce Clause's development.  Pp. 349-353. 

(d)  The  Court  generally  applies  the  rule  in  Pike  v.  Bruce  Church, 
Inc.,  397  U. S.  137,  142,  that  even  nondiscriminatory  burdens  on  com-
merce may be struck down on a showing that they clearly outweigh the 
benefits of a state or local practice.  But the current record and  schol-
arly material show that the Judicial Branch is not institutionally suited 
to draw reliable conclusions of the kind that would be necessary for the 
Davises  to  satisfy  a  Pike burden  in  this  particular  case.  Pp.  353-356.

Opinion of the Court 
on their own bonds from their state income taxes, which are imposed  on  bond  interest  from  other  States.  The  ques-

tion  here  is  whether  Kentucky's  version  of  this  differential tax  scheme  offends  the  Commerce  Clause.  We  hold  that  it 
does not.  I 

A 
Like  most  other  States,  the  Commonwealth  of  Kentucky taxes  its  residents'  income.  See  Ky.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann. 

$ 141.020(1)  (West  2006).  The  tax  is  assessed  on  "net  in-come," see 

ibid., calculated by reference to "gross income" as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, see $$ 141.010(9)-(11) 

(West Supp. 2007),1  which excludes "interest on any State or local bond" ("municipal bond," for short 

2), 26 U. S. C. $ 103(a). 

1 Specifically, Kentucky defines "net income" for noncorporate taxpayers 
as "adjusted gross income," minus certain deductions.  See Ky. Rev. Stat. 
Ann. $ 141.010(11).  "Adjusted gross income," in turn, is defined as "gross 
income" minus other deductions spelled out in the Internal Revenue Code 
and  elsewhere  in  the  Kentucky  statutes.  See  $ 141.010(10).  Finally, 
"gross income" has the same meaning set out in $ 61 of the Internal Reve-
nue Code.  See $ 141.010(9); see also 26 U. S. C. $ 61. 

2 "Municipal  bond" is  commonly  defined as a  "debt  obligation  of a  state 

or local  government entity."  J. Downes &  J. Goodman, Dictionary  of Fi-
nance  and  Investment  Terms  439  (7th  ed.  2006).  We  use  that  definition 
here;  our  references  to  "municipal  bonds"  thus  include  bonds  issued  by 
States and their political subdivisions. 

An  argument  raised  by  one  of  the  Davises'  amici  focuses  on  so-called 
"private-activity,"  "industrial-revenue,"  or  "conduit"  bonds,  a  subset  of 
municipal bonds used to finance projects by private entities.  These bonds 
are  often  (but  not  always)  exempt  under  the  Kentucky  scheme.  Amici 
contend  that  Kentucky's  exemption  of  these  bonds,  at  the  very  least, 
plainly violates the Commerce Clause.  See Brief for Alan D. Viard et al. 
as  Amici  Curiae  25-26.  This  argument,  however,  was  not  considered 
below, was never pressed by the Davises themselves, and is barely devel-
oped by amici.  Moreover, we cannot tell with certainty what the conse-
quences would be of holding that Kentucky violates the Commerce Clause 
by exempting such bonds; we must assume that it could disrupt important 
projects  that  the  States  have  deemed  to  have  public  purposes.  Accord-
ingly, it  is best  to set  this  argument  aside  and  leave  for  another  day any

Opinion of the Court 
Kentucky  piggybacks  on  this  exclusion,  but  only  up  to  a 
point:  it  adds  "interest  income  derived  from  obligations  of 
sister states and political subdivisions thereof " back into the 
taxable  net.  Ky.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 141.010(10)(c).  Interest 
on bonds issued by Kentucky and its political subdivisions is 
thus  entirely  exempt,3  whereas  interest  on  municipal  bonds 
of  other  States  and  their  subdivisions  is  taxable.  (Interest 
on  bonds  issued  by  private  entities  is  taxed  by  Kentucky 
regardless of the private issuer's home.) 

The ostensible reason for this regime is the attractiveness 
of tax-exempt bonds at "lower rates of interest . . .  than that 
paid on taxable . . .  bonds of comparable risk."  M. Graetz & 
D. Schenk, Federal Income Taxation 215 (5th ed. 2005) (here-
inafter  Graetz  &  Schenk).  Under  the  Internal  Revenue 
Code,  for  example,  see  26  U. S. C.  $ 103,  "if  the  market  rate 
of  interest  is  10  percent  on  a  comparable  corporate  bond,  a 
municipality  could  pay  only  6.5  percent  on  its  debt  and  a 
purchaser  in  a  35  percent  marginal  tax  bracket  would  be 
indifferent  between  the  municipal  and  the  corporate  bond, 
since  the  after-tax  interest  rate  on  the  corporate  bond  is 
6.5  percent,"  Graetz  &  Schenk  215.4  The  differential  tax 
scheme  in  Kentucky  works  the  same  way;  the  Common-
wealth's  tax  benefit  to  residents  who  buy  its  bonds  makes 

claim  that  differential  treatment  of  interest  on  private-activity  bonds 
should  be  evaluated  differently from  the  treatment  of  municipal bond  in-
terest generally. 

3 There  are  some  exceptions  which  derive  from  the  federal  exclusion, 

see 26 U. S. C. $ 103(b), but they do not matter here. 

4 The  amount  of  this  benefit  to  municipal  issuers  can  be  approximated 

by comparing the interest rates on municipal bonds to those on Treasury 
bonds, which  are  also  exempt  from  state taxation  but are subject  to  fed-
eral taxation.  "[A]t  the end of 2006, the borrowing costs on AAA-rated, 
10-year municipal bonds on average were 80.3 percent of comparable, but 
federally  taxable,  U.  S.  Treasury  securities,  [and]  at  the  end  of  2005  the 
borrowing costs on such municipal bonds were 88.4 percent of comparable 
U. S.  Treasury bonds."  Brief for  National  Federation of  Municipal  Ana-
lysts  as  Amicus  Curiae  8,  n.  4  (hereinafter  National  Federation  Brief).

Opinion of the Court 
lower interest rates acceptable,5  while limiting the exception to  Kentucky  bonds  raises  in-state  demand  for  them  without 

also subsidizing other issuers. The significance of the scheme is immense.  Between 1996 
and 2002, Kentucky and its subdivisions issued $7.7 billion in long-term bonds to pay for spending on transportation, pub-
lic  safety,  education,  utilities,  and  environmental  protection, among  other  things.  IRS,  Statistics  of  Income  Bulletin, 
C.  Belmonte,  Tax-Exempt  Bonds,  1996-2002,  pp.  169-170, http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/02govbnd.pdf  (as  visited  Jan. 
23, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).  Across the  Nation  during  the  same  period,  States  issued  over  $750 
billion in long-term  bonds, with nearly a third  of the  money going  to  education,  followed  by  transportation  (13%)  and 
utilities  (11%).  See  ibid.  Municipal  bonds  currently  fi-nance  roughly  two-thirds  of  capital  expenditures  by  state 
and local governments.  L. Thomas, Money, Banking and Fi-nancial Markets 55 (2006). 

Funding the work of government this way follows a tradi-tion  going  back  as  far  as  the  17th  century.  See  Johnson  & 
Rubin, The Municipal Bond Market: Structure and Changes, in  Handbook  of  Public  Finance  483,  485  (F.  Thompson  &  M. 
Green eds. 1998) ("[In] 1690 . . . Massachusetts issued bills of credit to pay soldiers who had participated in an unsuccessful 
raid  on  the  City  of  Quebec").  Municipal  bonds  first  ap-peared in the United States in the early 19th century: "New 
York  City  began  to  float  [debt]  securities  in  about  1812,"  A. Hillhouse,  Municipal  Bonds:  A  Century  of  Experience  31 
(1936)  (hereinafter  Hillhouse),  and  by  1822  Boston  "had  a bonded  debt  of  $100,000," 

id.,  at  32.  The  municipal  bond market  had  swelled  by  the  mid-1840s,  when  the  aggregate 

5 The precise reduction in interest rates depends on the federal and state 
income tax rates, the credit rating of the issuer, the term of the bond, and 
market  factors.  See  id.,  at  8.  The  reduction  in  interest  rates  is  gener-
ally greater the higher are a State's income tax rates.  See id., at 9, and 
n. 6.

debt  of  American  cities  exceeded  $27  million,  and  the  total debt  of  the  States  was  nearly  10  times  that  amount.  See 

ibid.  Bonds  funded  some  of  the  great  public  works  of  the day, including New York City's first water system, see id., at 
31, and  the  Erie  Canal,  see  R.  Amdursky &  C.  Gillette, Mu-nicipal  Debt  Finance  Law  $ 1.2.1,  p.  15  (1992)  (hereinafter 
Amdursky & Gillette).  At the turn of the 20th century, the total  state  and  municipal  debt  was  closing  in  on  $2  billion, 
see  Hillhouse  35,  and  by  the  turn  of  the  millennium,  over "$1.5 trillion in municipal bonds were outstanding," J. Temel, 
The  Fundamentals  of  Municipal  Bonds,  p.  ix  (5th  ed.  2001). Differential tax schemes like Kentucky's have a long pedi-
gree,  too.  State  income  taxation became widespread in the early  20th  century,  see  A.  Comstock,  State  Taxation  of  Per-
sonal  Incomes  11  (1921)  (reprinted  2005)  (hereinafter  Com-stock), and along with the new tax regimes came exemptions 
and deductions, see id., at 171-184, to induce all sorts of eco-nomic  behavior,  including  lending  to  state  and  local  govern-
ments  at  favorable  rates  of  untaxed  interest.  New  York enacted  the  first  of  these  statutes  in  1919,  see  1919  N.  Y. 
Laws pp. 1641-1642, the same year it imposed an income tax, see Comstock 104,

6  and other States followed, see, e. g., 1921 

N. C. Sess. Laws p. 208; 1923 N. H. Laws p. 78; 1926 Va. Acts ch. 576, pp. 960-961, with Kentucky joining the pack in 1936, 

see 1936 Ky. Acts p. 71.  Today, 41 States have laws like the one before us.

bonds  were  exempted  from  "every  federal  income  tax  act  enacted  since 
passage  of  the  Sixteenth  Amendment"  in  1913.  Amdursky  &  Gillette

Kentucky's system of taxing only extraterritorial bonds runs afoul  of  the  Commerce  Clause,"  197  S.  W.  3d,  at  564,  and 
the Supreme Court of Kentucky denied the Commonwealth's motion  for  discretionary  review,  see  App.  to  Pet.  for 
Cert. A14. We  granted  certiorari  owing  to  the  conflict  this  raised  on

The  Commerce  Clause  empowers  Congress  "[t]o  regulate Commerce  .  .  .  among  the  several  States,"  Art.  I,  $ 8,  cl.  3, 

and although its terms do not expressly restrain "the several States" in any way, we have sensed a negative implication in 
the provision since the early days, see, e. g., Cooley v.  Board of Wardens of Port of Philadelphia ex rel. Soc. for Relief of 
Distressed Pilots, 12 How. 299, 318-319 (1852); cf. Gibbons v. 
Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 209 (1824) (Marshall, C. J.) (dictum).  The modern law of what has come to be called the dormant Com-

merce  Clause  is  driven  by  concern  about  "economic  protec-

petitors."  New Energy Co. of Ind. v.  Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 273-274  (1988).  The  point  is  to  "effectuat[e]  the  Framers' 
purpose  to  `prevent  a  State  from  retreating  into  [the]  eco-nomic  isolation,' " 

Fulton  Corp.  v.  Faulkner,  516  U. S.  325, 
330  (1996)  (quoting  Oklahoma  Tax  Comm'n  v.  Jefferson 
Lines, Inc., 514 U. S. 175, 180 (1995); brackets omitted), "that had  plagued  relations  among  the  Colonies  and  later  among 

the  States  under  the  Articles  of  Confederation,"  Hughes  v. 
Oklahoma, 441 U. S. 322, 325-326 (1979). 

The law has had to respect a cross-purpose as well, for the 
Framers'  distrust  of  economic  Balkanization  was  limited  by 
their federalism favoring a degree of local autonomy.  Com-
pare  The  Federalist  Nos.  7  (A.  Hamilton),  11  (A.  Hamilton), 
and 42 (J. Madison), with The Federalist No. 51 (J. Madison); 
see  also  Garcia  v.  San  Antonio  Metropolitan  Transit  Au-
thority, 469 U. S. 528, 546 (1985) ("The essence of our federal 
system  is  that  within  the  realm  of  authority  left  open  to 
them under the Constitution, the States must be equally free 
to  engage  in  any  activity  that  their  citizens  choose  for  the 
common weal"). 

Under the resulting  protocol  for dormant  Commerce 
Clause  analysis,  we  ask  whether  a  challenged  law  discrim-
inates against interstate commerce.  See Oregon Waste Sys-
tems, Inc. v.  Department of Environmental Quality of Ore., 
511  U. S.  93,  99  (1994).  A  discriminatory  law  is  "virtually 
per  se  invalid,"  ibid.;  see  also  Philadelphia  v.  New  Jersey, 
437 U. S. 617, 624 (1978), and will survive only if it "advances 
a  legitimate  local  purpose  that  cannot  be  adequately  served 
by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives, " Oregon 
Waste Systems, supra, at 101 (internal quotation marks omit-
ted); see also Maine v.  Taylor, 477 U. S. 131, 138 (1986).  Ab-

scrutiny,  see,  e. g.,  United  Haulers  Assn.,  Inc.  v.  OneidaHerkimer  Solid  Waste  Management  Authority,  550  U. S. 
330,  346-347  (2007)  (plurality  opinion);  Northwest  Central 
Pipeline  Corp.  v.  State  Corporation  Comm'n  of  Kan.,  489 
U. S.  493,  525-526  (1989);  Minnesota  v.  Clover  Leaf  Cream-
ery Co., 449  U. S. 456, 472-474  (1981),  though  not  always,  as in 

Pike itself, 397 U. S., at 146. 
Some cases run a different course, however, and an excep-tion covers States that go beyond regulation and themselves 

"participat[e] in  the market" so as to "exercis[e] the  right to 
favor  [their]  own  citizens  over  others."  Alexandria  Scrap, 
supra, at 810.  This "market-participant" exception re-
flects a "basic distinction . . . between States as market par-
ticipants and States as market regulators," Reeves, 447 U. S., 
at  436,  "[t]here  [being]  no  indication  of  a  constitutional  plan 
to limit the ability of the States themselves to operate freely 
in  the  free  market,"  id.,  at  437.  See  also  White  v.  Massa-
chusetts  Council  of  Constr.  Employers,  Inc.,  460  U. S.  204, 
208  (1983)  ("[W]hen  a  state  or  local  government  enters  the 
market  as  a  participant  it  is  not  subject  to  the  restraints 
of  the  Commerce  Clause").  Thus,  in  Alexandria  Scrap,  we 
found that a state law authorizing state payments to proces-
sors  of  automobile  hulks  validly  burdened  out-of-state  proc-
essors  with  more onerous documentation  requirements than 
their in-state counterparts.  Likewise, Reeves  accepted 
South  Dakota's  policy  of  giving  in-state  customers  first  dibs 
on cement produced by a  state-owned plant, and White held 
that  a  Boston  executive  order  requiring  half  the  workers 
on  city-financed  construction  projects  to  be  city  residents 
passed muster. 

Our  most  recent  look  at  the  reach  of  the  dormant  Com-
merce  Clause  came  just  last  Term,  in  a  case  decided  inde-
pendently  of  the  market  participation  precedents.  United 
Haulers,  supra,  upheld  a  "flow  control"  ordinance  requiring

Opinion of the Court 
trash  haulers  to  deliver  solid  waste  to  a  processing  plant 
owned and operated by a public authority in New York State. 
We found "[c]ompelling reasons" for "treating [the ordinance] 
differently  from  laws  favoring  particular  private  businesses 
over  their  competitors."  Id.,  at  342.  State  and  local  gov-
ernments  that  provide  public  goods  and  services  on  their 
own, unlike private businesses, are "vested with the respon-
sibility of protecting the health, safety, and welfare of [their] 
citizens," ibid., and laws favoring such States and their sub-
divisions may "be directed toward any number of legitimate 
goals unrelated to protectionism," id., at 343.  That was true 
in United Haulers, where the ordinance addressed waste dis-
posal,  "both  typically  and  traditionally  a  local  government 
function."  Id., at 344 (quoting United Haulers Assn., Inc. v. 
Oneida-Herkimer  Solid  Waste  Management  Authority,  261 
F. 3d 245, 264 (CA2 2001) (Calabresi, J., concurring); internal 
quotation marks omitted).  And if more had been needed to 
show  that  New  York's  object  was  consequently  different 
from forbidden protectionism, we pointed out that "the most 
palpable  harm  imposed  by  the  ordinances--more  expensive 
trash removal--[was] likely to fall upon the very people who 
voted  for  the  laws,"  rather  than  out-of-state  interests. 
United  Haulers,  550  U. S.,  at  345.  Being  concerned  that  a 
"contrary approach . . .  would  lead to unprecedented and un-
bounded interference by the courts with state and local gov-
ernment,"  id.,  at  343,  we  held  that  the  ordinance  did  "not 
discriminate against interstate commerce for purposes of the 
dormant Commerce Clause," id., at 342.8 

8 In so holding, we distinguished our decision in C & A Carbone, Inc. v. 
Clarkstown, 511  U. S.  383  (1994),  which  struck down  a  very  similar ordi-
nance  on  Commerce  Clause  grounds.  The  Carbone  ordinance,  however, 
benefited a private processing facility, and we found  "this difference con-
stitutionally significant" for the reasons adverted to in the main text.  See 
United Haulers, 550 U. S., at 334.  Although the Carbone dissent argued 
that the private facility was "essentially a municipal facility," 511 U. S., at

A 
It  follows  a  fortiori  from  United  Haulers  that  Kentucky must prevail.  In United  Haulers,  we  explained  that  a  gov-

ernment  function  is  not  susceptible  to  standard  dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny owing to its likely motivation by 
legitimate  objectives  distinct  from  the  simple  economic  pro-tectionism the Clause abhors.  See id., at 343 ("Laws favor-
ing local government . . . may be directed toward any number of legitimate goals unrelated to protectionism"); see also 

id., at  344  (noting  that  "[w]e  should  be  particularly  hesitant  to 

interfere . . . under the guise of the Commerce Clause" where a  local  government  engages  in  a  traditional  government 
function).9  This  logic  applies  with  even  greater  force  to 
of  the  Carbone  majority  that  the  facility  was  properly  characterized  as 
private, see 550 U. S., at 339-340.

laws favoring a State's municipal bonds, given that the issu-ance of debt securities to pay for public projects is a quintes-

sentially public function, with the venerable history we have already  sketched, see  supra,  at 334-335.  By issuing bonds, 
state  and  local  governments  "sprea[d]  the  costs  of  public projects over time," Amdursky & Gillette $ 1.1.3, at 11, much 
as  one  might  buy  a  house  with  a  loan  subject  to  monthly payments.  Bonds place the cost of a project on the citizens 
who benefit from it  over the  years, see  ibid., and they allow for public work beyond what current revenues could support, 
see  id.,  $ 1.2,  at  12-13.  Bond  proceeds  are  thus  the  way  to shoulder  the  cardinal  civic  responsibilities  listed  in 

United 
Haulers:  protecting  the  health,10  safety,11  and  welfare 12  of citizens.  It should go without saying that the apprehension 

in  United  Haulers  about  "unprecedented  .  .  .  interference" with  a  traditional  government  function  is  just  as  warranted 
here, where the Davises would have us invalidate a century-old taxing practice, see supra, at 335, presently employed by 
41 States, see n. 7, supra, and affirmatively supported by all of them, see Brief for 49 States as Amici Curiae. 

In  fact,  this  emphasis  on  the  public  character  of  the  en-terprise  supported  by  the  tax  preference  is  just  a  step  in 
addressing  a  fundamental  element  of  dormant  Commerce Clause  jurisprudence,  the  principle  that  "any  notion  of  dis-
crimination  assumes  a  comparison  of  substantially  similar entities."  United  Haulers,  supra,  at  342  (quoting  General 

senters thus carry on the battle that was fought in United Haulers.  (The 
second fundamental difference goes to the realism and legitimacy of treat-
ing  bond  issuance  and  tax  provisions  as  aggregated  features  of  a  single 
scheme  of  public  finance.  Compare  infra,  at  344-345,  with  post,  at  367, 
374-375.)

Opinion of Souter, J.  
Motors Corp. v.  Tracy, 519 U. S. 278, 298 (1997); internal quo-tation  marks  omitted).  In  Bonaparte,  104  U. S.  592,  a  case 

involving  the  Full  Faith  and  Credit  Clause,  we  held  that  a foreign  State  is  properly  treated  as  a  private  entity  with 
respect  to  state-issued  bonds  that  have  traveled  outside  its borders.  See 

id., at 595 (beyond its borders, a debtor State "is compelled to go into the market as a borrower, subject to 

the  same  disabilities  in  this  particular  as  individuals,"  and has  none  "of  the  attributes  of  sovereignty  as  to  the  debt  it 
owes").  Viewed through this lens, the Kentucky tax scheme parallels  the  ordinance  upheld  in  United  Haulers:  it  "bene-
fit[s]  a  clearly  public  [issuer,  that  is,  Kentucky],  while  treat-ing all private [issuers] exactly the same."  550 U. S., at 342. 
There is no forbidden discrimination because Kentucky, as a public entity, does not have to treat itself as being "substan-

tially similar" to the other bond issuers in the market.13 Thus,  United  Haulers  provides  a  firm  basis  for  reversal. 
Just like the ordinances upheld there, Kentucky's tax exemp-tion  favors  a  traditional  government  function  without  any 
differential  treatment  favoring  local  entities  over  substan-tially  similar  out-of-state  interests.  This  type  of  law  does 
"not `discriminate against interstate commerce' for purposes of the dormant Commerce Clause." 

Id., at 345. 

B This case, like 
United Haulers, may also be seen under the broader rubric of the market participation doctrine, although 

the Davises say that market participant cases are inapposite here.  In  their  view,  we  may  not  characterize  state  action 
under  the  Kentucky  statutes  as  market  activity  for  public purposes, because  this  would ignore  a fact absent  in  United 

13 Contrary  to the dissent,  see post, at  371-372, we  do not suggest  that 
the  only  market  at  issue  here  is  a  discrete  market  for  Kentucky  bonds. 
In  fact,  we  recognize  that  the  relevant  market  can  be  conceived  more 
broadly.  See infra, at 350-351.  Our point goes not to the contours of the 
market, but to the proper characterization of the various entities acting in 
the market.

Opinion of Souter, J.  
Haulers  but  central  here:  this  is  a  case  about  differential taxation, and a difference that amounts to a heavier tax bur-

den on interstate activity is forbidden, see, e. g., Camps New-
found/Owatonna,  Inc.  v.  Town  of  Harrison,  520  U. S.  564 
(1997) (invalidating statute exempting charities from real es-tate  and  personal  property  taxes  unless  conducted  or  oper-

ated  principally  for  the  benefit  of  out-of-state  residents); 
Fulton Corp., 516  U. S.  325  (striking  down  tax  on  corporate stock held by state residents, where rate of tax was inversely 

proportional  to  the  corporation's  exposure  to  the  State's  in-come  tax); 

Bacchus  Imports,  Ltd.  v.  Dias,  468  U. S.  263 
(1984)  (holding  excise  tax  on  sale  of  liquor  at  wholesale  un-
constitutional because it exempted some locally produced al-
coholic beverages). 

The  Davises  make  a  fair  point  to  the  extent  that  they 
argue that Kentucky acts in two roles at once, issuing bonds 
and  setting  taxes,  and  if  looked  at  as  a  taxing  authority  it 
seems  to  invite  dormant  Commerce  Clause  scrutiny  of  its 
regulatory  activity,  see  Walling  v.  Michigan,  116  U. S.  446, 
455 (1886) ("A discriminating tax imposed by a State operat-
ing to the disadvantage of the products of other States when 
introduced into the first mentioned State, is, in effect, a regu-
lation in restraint of commerce among the States, and as such 
is  a  usurpation  of  the  power  conferred  by  the  Constitution 
upon  the  Congress");  see  also  Camps  Newfound,  supra,  at 
578  ("[I]t  is  clear  that  discriminatory  burdens  on  interstate 
commerce imposed by regulation or taxation may . . . violate 
the Commerce Clause"); Tracy, supra, at 287 ("The negative 
or  dormant  implication  of  the  Commerce  Clause  prohibits 
state  taxation  .  .  .  that  discriminates  against  or  unduly  bur-
dens interstate commerce"). 

But there is  no ignoring the fact  that imposing the differ-
ential tax scheme makes sense only because Kentucky is also 
a bond  issuer.  The Commonwealth  has  entered  the  market 
for debt  securities,  just as Maryland entered  the  market for 
automobile  hulks,  see  Alexandria  Scrap,  426  U. S.,  at  806,

Opinion of Souter, J.  
and  South  Dakota  entered  the  cement  market,  see  Reeves, 447  U. S.,  at  440.  It  simply  blinks  this  reality  to  disaggre-

gate  the  Commonwealth's  two  roles  and  pretend  that  in  ex-empting  the  income  from  its  securities,  Kentucky  is  inde-
pendently  regulating  or  regulating  in  the  garden  variety way  that  has  made  a  State  vulnerable  to the  dormant  Com-
merce  Clause.  States  that  regulated  the  price  of  milk,  see, 
e. g., West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v.  Healy, 512 U. S. 186 (1994); Baldwin v.  G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U. S. 511 (1935), did not 

keep  herds  of  cows  or  compete  against  dairy  producers  for the  dollars  of  milk  drinkers.  But  when  Kentucky  exempts 
its  bond  interest,  it  is  competing  in  the  market  for  limited investment  dollars,  alongside  private  bond  issuers  and  its 
sister  States,  and  its  tax  structure  is  one  of  the  tools  of competition.

14 

The failure  to appreciate  that regulation  by  taxation here goes hand in hand with market participation by selling bonds 

allows  the  Davises  to  advocate  the  error  of  focusing  exclu-sively  on  the  Commonwealth  as  regulator  and  ignoring  the

in  dual  roles.  The  mayor  of  Boston  promulgated  an  execu-tive  order  that  bore  the  hallmarks  of  regulation:  it  applied 
to  every  construction  project  funded  wholly  or  partially  by city funds (or funds administered by the city), and it imposed

see also id., at 218-219 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("The executive order in this case . . . is a 
direct attempt to govern private economic relationships. . . . 
[It]  is  the  essence  of  regulation").  At  the  same  time,  the city  took  part  in  the  market  by  "expend[ing]  .  .  .  its  own 

funds in entering into construction contracts for public proj-ects." 

Id., at 214-215 (opinion of the Court).  After speak-
ing of " `[t]he basic distinction . . . between States as market 
participants  and  States  as  market  regulators,' "  id.,  at  207 
(quoting  Reeves,  supra,  at  436-437),  White  did  not  dissect 
Boston's conduct and ignore the former.  Instead, the Court 
treated the regulatory activity in favor of local and minority 
labor  as  terms  or  conditions  of  the  government's  efforts  in 
its market role, which was treated as dispositive. 

Similarly,  in  Alexandria  Scrap,  Maryland  employed  the 
tools of regulation to invigorate its participation in the mar-
ket  for  automobile  hulks.  The  specific  controversy  there 
was over documentation requirements included in a "compre-
hensive  statute  designed  to  speed  up  the  scrap  cycle."  426 
U. S.,  at  796.  Superficially,  the  scheme  was  regulatory  in 
nature;  but  the  Court's  decision  was  premised  on  its  view 
that, in practical terms, Maryland had not only regulated but 
had also "entered into the market itself to bid up [the] price" 
of automobile hulks.  See id., at 806. 

United  Haulers, though  not placed  under the  market par-
ticipant  umbrella,  may  be  seen  as  another  example.  Not 
only  did  the  public  authority  acting  in  that  case  process 
trash,  but  its  governmental  superiors  forbade  trash  haulers 
to  deal  with  any  other  processors.  This  latter  fact  did  not 
determine the outcome, however; the dispositive fact was the 
government's  own  activity  in  processing  trash.  We  upheld 
the  government's  decision  to  shut  down  the  old  market  for

Opinion of Souter, J.  
trash  processing  only  because  it  created  a  new  one  all  by itself,  and  thereby  became  a  participant  in  a  market  with 

just one supplier of a necessary service.  If instead the gov-ernment had created a monopoly in favor of a private hauler, 
we would have struck down the law just as we did in C & A  
Carbone,  Inc.  v.  Clarkstown,  511  U. S.  383  (1994).  United 
Haulers  accordingly  turned  on  our  decision  to  give  para-
mount consideration to the public function in actively dealing in  the  trash  market;  if  the  Davises  had  their  way, 

United 
Haulers  would  be  overruled  and  the  market  participation doctrine would describe a null set (or maybe a set of one, see 

Reeves, supra). 

In each of these cases the commercial activities by the gov-
ernments  and  their  regulatory  efforts  complemented  each 
other in some way, and in each of them the fact of tying the 
regulation  to  the  public  object  of  the  foray  into  the  market 
was  understood  to  give  the  regulation  a  civic  objective  dif-
ferent from the discrimination traditionally held to be unlaw-
ful:  in  the  paradigm  of  unconstitutional  discrimination  the 
law chills interstate activity by creating a commercial advan-
tage  for  goods  or  services  marketed  by  local  private  actors, 
not  by  governments  and  those  they  employ  to  fulfill  their 
civic objectives, see, e. g., Fulton Corp., 516 U. S. 325 (higher 
tax on the stock of corporations with little or no presence in 
the State); New Energy Co. of Ind., 486 U. S. 269 (tax credit 
to  sellers  of  ethanol  available  only  for  ethanol  produced  in 
the State); Bacchus Imports, Ltd., 468 U. S. 263 (tax exemp-
tion  that  applied  only  to  sales  of  certain  locally  produced 
liquors);  Lewis  v.  BT  Investment  Managers,  Inc.,  447  U. S.

businesses that provided investment advisory services); Bos-
ton  Stock  Exchange  v.  State  Tax  Comm'n,  429  U. S.  318 
(1977)  (higher  tax  on  sale  of  securities  by  nonresidents  if 
the  securities  were  sold  on  an  out-of-state,  not  an  in-state, 
exchange).  In sum, our cases on market regulation without

Opinion of Souter, J.  
Clause  analysis;  our  cases  on  market  participation  joined with  regulation  (the  usual  situation)  prescribe  exceptional 

treatment  for  this  direct  governmental  activity  in  commer-cial markets for the public's benefit.

16 

The Kentucky tax scheme falls outside the forbidden para-digm  because  the  Commonwealth's  direct  participation  fa-

vors, not local private entrepreneurs, but the Commonwealth and local governments.  The Commonwealth enacted its tax 
code  with  an  eye  toward  making  some  or  all  of  its  bonds more marketable.  When it issues them for sale in the bond 
market,  it  relies  on  that  tax  code,  and  seller  and  purchaser treat the bonds and the tax rate as joined just as intimately, 
say,  as  the  work  force  requirements  and  city  construction contracts  were  in  Boston.  Issuing  bonds  must  therefore 
have  the  same  significance  under  the  dormant  Commerce Clause  as  government  trash  processing,  junk  car  disposal, 
or construction; and United Haulers, Alexandria Scrap, and White  can  be  followed  only  by  rejecting  the  Davises'  argu-
ment  that  Kentucky's  regulatory  activity  should  be  viewed in isolation as Commerce Clause discrimination.

17 

16 Significantly,  our  market  participant  cases  are  not  limited  to  cases 
where the government  supplies a uniquely public  product.  This much  is 
manifest from Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429 (1980).  There is nothing 
remarkable  or  inherently  governmental  about  the  cement  South  Dakota 
produced, and yet we  recognized that the  State may engage  in clear  dis-
crimination  against  out-of-state  buyers  that  regular  dormant  Commerce 
Clause analysis would undoubtedly have held unconstitutional. 

17 The  dissent  criticizes  this  analysis  on  the  basis  of  our  statement  in 

Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v.  Town of Harrison, 520 U. S. 564, 593 
(1997), that "[a] tax exemption is not  the sort of direct state involvement 
in  the  market  that  falls  within  the  market-participation  doctrine."  See 
post, at 374-375.  This both misses the point and leaves the language from 
Camps Newfound shorn of context.  In Camps Newfound, the tax exemp-
tion  was  unaccompanied  by  any  market  activity  by  the  State;  it  favored 
only private charitable institutions.  We correctly rejected the argument 
that a tax exemption without more constitutes market participation.  But 
we had no occasion to consider the scheme here, where a State employs a

Opinion of the Court 

C A  look  at  the  specific  markets  in  which  the  exemption's 

effects are felt both confirms the conclusion that no tradition-ally  forbidden  discrimination  is  underway  and  points  to  the 
distinctive character  of the  tax policy.  The market  as most broadly  conceived  is  one  of  issuers  and  holders  of  all  fixed-
income securities, whatever their source or ultimate destina-tion.  In  this  interstate  market,  Kentucky  treats  income 
from  municipal  bonds  of  other  States  just  like  income  from bonds privately issued in  Kentucky or elsewhere; no  prefer-
ence is given to any local issuer, and none to any local holder, beyond  what  is  entailed  in  the  preference  Kentucky  grants 
itself when it engages in activities serving public objectives. A more specialized market can be understood as commerce 
solely  in  federally  tax-exempt  municipal  bonds,  much  of  it 
tax exemption to facilitate its own participation in the market.  As noted 
before, one of the dissent's critical premises is the disaggregation of bond 
issuance and tax treatment, see post, at 367, 374; that strikes us as a denial 
of economic reality. 

The  dissent  also  suggests  that  our  reasoning  conflicts  with  SouthCentral  Timber  Development,  Inc.  v.  Wunnicke,  467  U. S.  82  (1984),  see 
post,  at  375,  but  there  is  no  conflict.  In  South-Central,  Alaska  condi-
tioned the sale of state timber to private purchasers by requiring that the 
timber  be  processed  within  the  State  prior  to  export,  and  a  plurality 
struck down the condition under the Commerce Clause.  The case turned 
on  the  plurality's  conclusion  that  the  processing  requirement  constituted 
a  "restrictio[n]  on  dispositions  subsequent  to  the  goods  coming  to  rest  in 
private hands."  467 U. S., at 98; see id., at 95 ("Under the Alaska require-
ment, . . . the  choice is made for [the purchaser]: if he buys timber from the 
State he is not free  to take  the timber out of state prior to processing"). 
Kentucky  imposes  no  such  restrictions  on  the  disposition  of  Kentucky 
bonds;  bondholders  are  free  to  sell  the  bonds  to  whomever  they  please. 
Thus,  the  type of  "downstream  regulation"  that South-Central  found  ob-
jectionable  is  simply  not  present  here.  Id.,  at  99.  We  note  also  that 
South-Central expressly applied "more rigorous" Commerce Clause scru-
tiny because the case involved "foreign commerce" and restrictions on the 
resale of "a natural resource."  Id., at 100, 96.  Neither of those elements 
appears here.

conducted through interstate municipal bond funds.18  Here, 
of  course,  the  distinction  between  the  taxing  State's  bonds 
and  their  holders  and  issuers  and  holders  of  out-of-state 
counterparts  is  at  its  most  stark.  But  what  is  remarkable 
about  the  issuers  in  this  and  the  broader  interstate  market 
is that nearly every taxing State believes its public interests 
are served by  the same tax-and-exemption  feature, which  is 
supported  in  this  Court  by  every  one  of  the  States  (with  or 
without an income tax) despite the ranges of relative wealth 
and tax rates among them.  See Brief for 49 States as Amici 
Curiae.  These  facts  suggest  that  no  State  perceives  any 
local advantage or disadvantage beyond the permissible ones 
open  to  a  government  and  to  those  who  deal  with  it  when 
that  government  itself  enters  the  market.  See  supra,  at 
344-348. 

An equally significant perception emerges from examining 
the  third  type  of  market  for  municipal  bonds:  the  one  for 
bonds  within  the  State  of  issue,  a  large  proportion  of  which 
market in each State is managed by one or more single-state 
funds.  By  definition,  there  is  no  discrimination  against  in-
terstate  activity  within  the  market  itself,  but  one  of  its  fea-
tures  reveals  an  important  benefit  of  intrastate  bond  mar-
kets  as  they  operate  through  these  funds.  The  intrastate

See  National  Federation  Brief  15  (compared  with  single-state  funds,  "[n]ational  mutual  funds . . . are  less  likely  to 
dedicate  the  time  necessary  to  evaluate  a  small,  obscure  or infrequent municipal bond issuer or to purchase bonds issued

disappear if the current differential tax schemes were upset.

Brief 18, 19 ("The main adverse impact of the disappearance of  single  state  funds  .  .  .  would  be  felt  by  small  municipal 
issuers" because they "would stand to lose much of the intra-state market for the bonds that has developed under the cur-
rently  prevailing  state  tax  system  without  gaining  much  of an  interstate  market  from  its  elimination").  Financing  for 
long-term  municipal  improvements  would  thus  change  radi-cally if the differential tax feature disappeared.

19 

This  probable  indispensability  of  the  current  scheme  to maintaining  single-state  markets  serving  smaller  municipal 

borrowers  not  only  underscores  how  far  the  States'  objec-tives  probably  lie  from  the  forbidden protectionism  for  local 
business; it also tends to explain why the States are so com-mitted to a taxing practice that much scholarship says often 
produces a net burden of tax revenues lost over interest ex-pense  saved.  See,  e. g.,  Brief  for  Alan  D.  Viard  et  al.  as 
Amici  Curiae  19  ("[S]tates  routinely  fail  to  recoup  the  cost of the tax subsidy in the form of lower financing rates" (citing

they  will  have  to  be  more  selective  in  what  projects  they  choose  to

feature  is  a  far  cry  from  the  private  protectionism  that  has 
driven  the  development  of  the  dormant  Commerce  Clause. 
It  is  also  fatal  to  the  Davises'  backup  argument  that  this 
case should be remanded for analysis under the rule in Pike, 
397 U. S. 137. 

IV 

Concluding  that  a state  law  does  not  amount  to  forbidden 
discrimination  against  interstate  commerce  is  not  the  death 
knell  of  all  dormant  Commerce  Clause  challenges,  for  we 
generally  leave  the  courtroom  door  open  to  plaintiffs  invok-
ing the rule in Pike, that even nondiscriminatory burdens on 
commerce may be struck down on a showing that those bur-
dens clearly outweigh the benefits of a state or local practice. 
See id., at 142.  The Kentucky courts made no Pike enquiry, 
and  the  Davises  ask  us  to  remand  for  one  now,  see  Brief 
for Respondents 43. 

The  Davises'  request  for  Pike  balancing  assumes  an  an-
swer  to  an  open  question:  whether  Pike  even  applies  to  a 
case  of this  sort.  United  Haulers included  a Pike analysis, 
see  550  U. S.,  at  346-347  (plurality  opinion),  but  our  cases 
applying the market participant exception have not, see, e. g., 
White,  460  U. S.  204;  Alexandria  Scrap,  426  U. S.  794.  We 
need  not  decide  this  question  today,  however,  for  Kentucky 
has  not  argued  that  Pike  is  irrelevant,  see  Reply  Brief  for 
Petitioners  2,  n.  1,  and  even  on  the  assumption  that  a  Pike 
examination might generally be in order in this type of case, 
the  current  record  and  scholarly  material  convince  us  that 
the Judicial Branch is not institutionally suited to draw reli-
able conclusions  of the  kind that would be necessary for the 
Davises to satisfy a Pike burden in this particular case. 

The  institutional  difficulty  is  manifest  in  the  very  train 
of  disadvantages  that  the  Davises'  counsel  attributes  to  the 
current differential tax scheme: 

"First,  it  harms  out-of-state  issuers  (i. e.,  other  States 
and  their  subdivisions)  by  blocking  their  access  to  in-

Opinion of the Court 
vestment dollars in Kentucky.  Second, it similarly 
harms  out-of-state  private  sellers  (e. g.,  underwriters, 
individuals, and investment funds) who wish to sell their 
bonds in Kentucky.  Third, it harms the national munic-
ipal  bond  market  and  its  participants  by  distorting  and 
impeding  the  free  flow  of  capital.  Fourth,  it  harms 
Kentucky  investors  by  promoting  risky,  high-cost  in-
vestment  vehicles.  Fifth,  it  harms  the  States  by  com-
pelling  them  to  enact  competing  discriminatory  laws 
that  decrease  their  net  revenues."  Brief  for  Respond-
ents 9. 

Even if each of these drawbacks does to some degree eventu-
ate  from  the  system,  it  must  be  apparent  to  anyone  that 
weighing  or  quantifying  them  for  a  cost-benefit  analysis 
would be a very subtle exercise.  It is striking, after all, that 
most  of  the  harms  allegedly  flowing  directly  or  indirectly 
to  Kentucky's  sister  States  and  their  citizens  have  failed  to 
dissuade  even  a  single  State  from  supporting  the  current 
system;  every  one  of  them,  including  States  with  no  income 
tax, have lined up with Kentucky in this case. 

The  prospect  for  reliable  Pike  comparison  dims  even  fur-
ther when we turn to the benign function of the current sys-
tem  flagged  a  moment  ago.  Is  any  court  in  a  position  to 
evaluate  the  advantage  of  the  current  market  for  bonds  is-
sued  by  the  smaller  municipalities,  the  ones  with  no  ready 
access  to  any  other  bond  market  than  single-state  funds? 
Consider  that  any  attempt  to  place  a  definite  value  on  this 
feature  of  the  existing  system  would  have  to  confront  the 
what-if  questions.  If  termination  of  the  differential  tax 
scheme jeopardized or eliminated most single-state funds (as 
the cited authorities predict), would some new source of capi-
tal  take  their  place?  Would  the  interstate  markets  accom-
modate the small issuers (as no cited authorities predict), or 
would the  financing  in  question be replaced  by  current local 
taxation  for  long-term  projects  (unlikely,  considering  that

Opinion of the Court 
financially  weaker  borrowers  are  involved),  or  would  state 
governments assume responsibility through their own bonds 
or by state taxation?  Or would capital to some degree sim-
ply dry up, eliminating a class of municipal improvements? 20 
And  if  some  new  source  or  sources  of  capital  became  avail-
able  for  these  improvements  in  a  given  State,  how  likely  is 
it that the new scheme would produce measurable net bene-
fits  to  other  States  seeking  capital,  and  how  perceptibly 
would  it  produce  a  freer  flow  of  funds?  Money  spent  up 
front on increased local or state taxation is no more available 
for  out-of-state  investment  than  money  invested  in  local 
bonds; sinking funds would be obviated, but what would the 
effect be on interstate capital flows? 

What is most significant about these cost-benefit questions 
is not even the difficulty of answering them or the inevitable 
uncertainty  of  the  predictions  that  might  be  made  in  trying 
to come up with answers, but the unsuitability of the judicial 
process and judicial forums for making whatever predictions

Opinion of the Court 
ing  Minneapolis  Star  &  Tribune  Co.  v.  Minnesota  Comm'r of Revenue, 460 U. S. 575, 589-590 (1983))). 

While  it  is  not  our  business  to  suggest  that  the  current system  be  reconsidered,  if  it  is  to  be  placed  in  question  a 
congressional  forum  has  two  advantages.  Congress  has some  hope  of  acquiring  more  complete  information  than  ad-
versary trials may produce, and an elected legislature is the preferable institution for incurring the economic risks of any 
alteration  in  the  way  things  have  traditionally  been  done. And risk is the essence of what the Davises are urging here. 
It  would  miss  the  mark  to  think  that  the  Kentucky  courts, and ultimately this Court, are being invited merely to tinker 
with  details  of  a  tax  scheme;  we  are  being  asked  to  apply  a federal  rule  to  throw  out  the  system  of  financing  municipal 
improvements throughout most of the United States, and the rule  in Pike  was  never  intended  to  authorize  a  court  to  ex-
pose  the  States  to  the  uncertainties  of  the  economic  experi-mentation the Davises request. 

* * * 
The dissent rightly praises the virtues of the free market, and  it  warns  that  our  decision  to  uphold  Kentucky's  tax 

scheme  will  result  in  untoward  consequences  for  that  mar-ket.  See, e. g., post, at 375-376.  But the warning is alarm-
ism; going back to 1919 the state regimes of differential bond taxation have been elements of the national commerce with-
out  wilting  the  Commerce  Clause.  The  threat  would  come, instead,  from  the  dissent's  approach,  which  to  a  certainty 
would  upset  the  market  in  bonds  and  the  settled  expecta-tions  of  their  issuers  based  on  the  experience  of  nearly  a 
century. We  have  been  here  before.  Our  predecessors  on  this 
Court responded  to  an earlier  invitation  to the  adventurism of  overturning  a  traditional  local  taxing  practice.  Justice 
Holmes answered that "the mode of taxation is of long stand-ing, and upon questions of constitutional law the long settled

ing novel state-law questions and complex factual determinations about 
long-past  state-court  proceedings.  Respondent  greatly  exaggerates 
the difficulties because (1) receipt of a recidivist enhancement will neces-
sarily be evident from  the sentence's length in some cases; (2) the  con-
viction  judgment  will  sometimes  list  the  maximum  possible  sentence 
even  where  the  sentence  actually  imposed  did  not  exceed  the  top  sen-
tence allowed without recidivist enhancement; (3) some jurisdictions re-
quire the prosecution to submit a publicly available charging document 
to obtain a recidivist enhancement; (4) a plea colloquy will often include 
a  statement  by  the  trial  judge  regarding  the  maximum  penalty;  and 
(5) where the records do not show that the defendant faced a recidivist 
enhancement, the Government may well be precluded from establishing 
that  a  conviction  was  for  a  qualifying  offense.  Merely  because  future 
cases might present difficulties cannot justify disregarding ACCA's clear 
meaning.  Pp. 388-389. 

(e)  Also  unavailing  is  respondent's  argument  that  if  recidivist  en-
hancements can increase the "maximum term" under ACCA, then man-
datory  guidelines  systems  capping  sentences  can  decrease  the  "maxi-
mum  term,"  whereas  Congress  cannot  have  wanted  to  make  the 
"maximum  term"  dependent  on  the  complexities  of  state  sentencing 
guidelines.  The  phrase  "maximum  term  of  imprisonment  .  .  .  pre-
scribed by law" for the "offense" could not have been meant to apply to 
the  top  sentence  in  a  guidelines  range  because  (1)  such  a  sentence  is 
generally not really the maximum because guidelines systems typically 
allow  a  sentencing  judge  to  impose  a  sentence  that  exceeds  the  top  of 
the  guidelines  range  under  appropriate  circumstances;  and  (2)  in  all  of 
the many statutes predating ACCA and the federal Sentencing Reform 
Act of 1984 that used the concept of the "maximum" term prescribed by 
law,  the  concept  necessarily  referred to  the  maximum  term  prescribed 
by the relevant criminal statute, not the top of a sentencing guidelines 
range.  United

Opinion of the Court 
RHW (ED Wash.,  Sept. 3, 2004), p. 5, App. 245, 250 (herein-after  Sentencing  Order).  At  the  time  of  respondent's  drug 

offenses,  the  Washington  statute  that  respondent  was  con-victed  of  violating  stated  that,  upon  conviction,  a  defend-
ant  could  be  "imprisoned  for  not  more  than  five  years," $$ 69.50.401(a)(1)(ii)-(iv), but another provision specified that 
"[a]ny  person  convicted  of  a  second  or  subsequent  offense" could "be imprisoned for a term up to twice the term other-
wise  authorized,"  $ 69.50.408(a).  Thus,  by  virtue  of  this latter,  recidivist,  provision  respondent  faced  a  maximum 
penalty of imprisonment for 10 years.  The judgment of con-viction for each of the drug-delivery charges listed the maxi-
mum  term  of  imprisonment  for  the  offense  as  "ten  years," App.  16,  42,  93,  but  the  state  court sentenced  respondent  to 
concurrent  sentences  of  48  months'  imprisonment  on  each count, id.,

Opinion of the Court 
both  that  provision,  which  prescribes  a  "maximum  term"  of 5  years  for  a  first  "offense,"  and  $ 69.50.408(a),  which  pre-

scribes a "maximum term" of 10 years for a second or subse-quent "offense."  Thus, in this case, the maximum term pre-
scribed  by  Washington  law  for  at  least  two  of  respondent's state drug offenses was 10 years. 

The  Ninth  Circuit's  holding  that  the  maximum  term  was five  years 

contorts  ACCA's  plain  terms.  Although  the Washington  state  court  sentenced  respondent  to  48  months' 

imprisonment, there is no  dispute that  $ 69.50.408(a) permit-ted  a  sentence  of  up  to  10  years.  On  the  Ninth  Circuit's 
reading of ACCA, even if respondent had been sentenced to, 
say, six years' imprisonment, "the maximum term of impris-
onment" prescribed  by  law  still would  have  been  five years. 
It  is  hard  to  accept  the  proposition  that  a  defendant  may 
lawfully  be  sentenced  to  a  term  of  imprisonment  that  ex-
ceeds  the  "maximum  term  of  imprisonment  .  .  .  prescribed 
by law," but that is where the Ninth Circuit's reading of the 
statute leads. 

The Ninth Circuit's interpretation is also inconsistent with 
the  way  in  which  the  concept  of  the  "maximum  term  of  im-
prisonment" is customarily understood by participants in the 
criminal  justice  process.  Suppose  that  a  defendant  who  in-
disputably had more than three prior convictions for "violent 
felon[ies]" or "serious drug offense[s]" was charged in federal 
court  with  violating  the  felon-in-possession  statute.  Under 
ACCA, this defendant would face a sentence of "not less than 
15  years."  18  U. S. C.  $ 924(e)(1)  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  V).  Sup-
pose  that  the  defendant  asked  his  or  her  attorney,  "What's 
the  maximum  term  I  face  for  the  new  offense?"  An  attor-
ney  aware  of  ACCA  would  surely  not  respond,  "10  years," 
even  though  10  years  is  the  maximum  sentence  without  the 
ACCA enhancement.  See $ 924(a)(2) (2000 ed.). 

Suppose  that  the  defendant  then  pleaded  guilty  to  the 
felon-in-possession charge.  Under Federal Rule of Criminal 
Procedure  11(b)(1)(H),  the  trial  judge  would  be  required  to

Respondent's  argument  based  on  ACCA's  "manifest  pur-pose"  must  also  be  rejected.  Respondent  argues  that 

ACCA  uses  "the  maximum  penalty  specified  for  the  offense by  state  law  as  a  short-hand  means  of  identifying  conduct 
deemed sufficiently `serious'  to trigger [the] mandatory  pen-alty."

"categories  of "  offenders.  Respondent  suggests  that  Con-gress'  failure  to  include  such language  in  ACCA  means  that 

Congress  intended  to  refer  to  a  "maximum  term"  that  does not  depend  on  whether  a  defendant  falls  into  the  first-time-
offender  or  recidivist  "category."  Respondent  does  not  ex-plain  how  18  U. S. C.  $ 924(e)(2)(A)  could  have  easily  been 
reworded  to  mirror  28  U. S. C.  $ 994(h).  But  in  any  event, 
the language used in ACCA, for the reasons explained above, is more than clear enough. 

Respondent argues that the Ninth Circuit's decision is sup-ported  by  the  so-called  "categorical"  approach  that  we  used

First,  in  some  cases,  a  defendant  will  have  received  a  re-cidivist  enhancement,  and  this  will  necessarily  be  evident 

from  the  length  of  the  sentence  imposed.  Second,  as  the present case illustrates, see App. 16, 42, 93, the judgment of 
conviction  will  sometimes  list  the  maximum  possible  sen-tence  even  where  the  sentence  that  was  imposed  did  not 
exceed  the  top  sentence  allowed  without  any  recidivist enhancement.  Third,  as  respondent  himself  notes,  some 
jurisdictions  require  that  the  prosecution  submit  a  formal charging  document  in  order  to  obtain  a  recidivist  enhance-
ment.  See  Brief  for  Respondent  33.  Such  documents  fall within the limited  list of generally available documents that 
courts  already  consult  for  the  purpose  of  determining  if  a past  conviction  qualifies  as  an  ACCA  predicate.  See  Shep-

(Following  this  pattern,  Washington  law  likewise  provided at  the  time  of  respondent's state  convictions  that  a  sentenc-

ing judge could "impose a sentence outside the standard sen-tence  range"  upon  a  finding  "that  there  [were]  substantial 
and  compelling  reasons  justifying  an  exceptional  sentence." Wash. Rev. Code $ 9.94A.120(2) (1994).

Second,  the  concept  of  the  "maximum"  term  of  imprison-ment  or  sentence  prescribed  by  law  was  used  in  many  stat-

utes  that  predated  the  enactment  of  ACCA  and  the  federal Sentencing  Reform  Act  of  1984,  Pub.  L.  98-473,  $ 211,  98 
Stat.  1987,  and  in  all  those  statutes  the  concept  necessarily referred  to  the  maximum  term  prescribed  by  the  relevant 
criminal statute, not the top of a sentencing guidelines range. See,

The  state  trial  court  rejected  Stokes's  argument  and  en-tered  judgment  for  the  state  defendants.  Stokes  immedi-
ately  appealed  to  the  Alabama  Supreme  Court  and  sought an  order  staying  the  election  pending  that  court's  decision. 
The requested stay was denied, and the special election went forward in June 1987.  The winner, Samuel Jones, took office 
as  District  One's  Commissioner  in  July  1987.  Approxi-mately  14  months  later,  however,  in  September  1988,  the

tions.  Sullivan,  as  interpreted  by  Jackson,  as  well  as  a  long  line  of 
related cases where the Court construes $$ 1981 and 1982 similarly, lead 
to  the  conclusion  that  the  view  that  $ 1981  encompasses  retaliation 
claims  is  well  embedded  in  the  law.  Stare  decisis  considerations 
strongly  support  the  Court's  adherence  to  that  view.  Such  considera-
tions impose a considerable burden on those who would seek a different 
interpretation  that would  necessarily  unsettle  many  Court  precedents. 
Pp. 446-452. 

(b)  CBOCS' several arguments, taken separately or together, cannot 
justify  a  departure  from  this  well-embedded  interpretation  of  $ 1981. 
First, while CBOCS is correct that $ 1981's plain text does not expressly 
refer  to  retaliation,  that  alone  is  not  sufficient  to  carry  the  day,  given 
this Court's long recognition that $ 1982 provides protection against re-
taliation;  Jackson's  recent  holding  that  Title  IX  of  the  Education 
Amendments  of  1972  includes  an  antiretaliation  remedy,  despite  Title 
IX's failure to use the word "retaliation," 544 U. S., at 173-174, 176; and 
Sullivan's refusal to embrace a similar argument, see 396 U. S., at 241. 
Second,  contrary  to  CBOCS'  assertion,  Congress'  failure  to  include  an 
explicit  antiretaliation  provision  in  its  1991  amendment  of  $ 1981  does 
not demonstrate an intention not to cover retaliation, but is more plausi-
bly  explained  by  the  fact  that,  given  Sullivan  and  the  new  statutory 
language nullifying Patterson, there was no need to include explicit re-
taliation  language.  Third,  the  argument  that  applying  $ 1981  to 
employment-related  retaliation  actions  would  create  an  overlap  with 
Title  VII,  allegedly  allowing  a  retaliation  plaintiff  to  circumvent  Title 
VII's  detailed  administrative  and  procedural  mechanisms  and  thereby 
undermine  their  effectiveness,  proves  too  much.  Precisely  the  same 
kind  of  Title  VII/$ 1981  "overlap"  and  potential  circumvention  exists 
in  respect  to  employment-related  direct  discrimination,  yet  Congress 
explicitly and intentionally created that overlap, Alexander v.  GardnerDenver  Co.,  415  U. S.  36,  48-49.  Fourth,  contrary  to  its  arguments, 
CBOCS  cannot  find  support  in  Burlington  N.  &  S.  F.  R.  Co.  v.  White, 
548  U. S.  53,  63,  and  Domino's  Pizza,  Inc.  v.  McDonald, 546  U. S.  470. 
While Burlington distinguished discrimination based on status (e. g., as 
women  or  black  persons)  from  discrimination  based  on  conduct  (e. g., 
whistle-blowing  that  leads  to  retaliation),  it  did  not  suggest  that  Con-
gress  must  separate  the  two in  all  events.  Moreover,  while Domino's 
Pizza and other more recent cases may place greater emphasis on statu-
tory  language  than  did  Sullivan,  any  arguable  change  in  interpretive 
approach would  not justify reexamination of  well-established  prior law 
under stare decisis principles.  Pp. 452-457.

trial  in  respect  to  his  $ 1981  retaliation  claim.  In  doing  so, 
the Court of Appeals rejected CBOCS' argument that $ 1981 
did  not  encompass  a  claim  of  retaliation.  474  F.  3d  387 
(2007).  CBOCS sought certiorari, asking us to consider this 
last-mentioned  legal  question.  And  we  agreed  to  do  so. 
See 551 U. S. 1189 (2007). 

II 

The  question  before  us  is  whether $ 1981  encompasses  re-
taliation  claims.  We  conclude  that  it  does.  And  because 
our  conclusion  rests  in  significant  part  upon  principles  of 
stare decisis, we begin by examining the pertinent interpre-
tive history. 

A 

The Court  first considered  a comparable  question in 1969, 
in Sullivan v.  Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U. S. 229.  The 
case arose under Rev. Stat. $ 1978, 42 U. S. C. $ 1982, a statu-
tory  provision  that  Congress  enacted  just  after  the  Civil 
War, along with $ 1981, to protect the rights of black citizens. 
The  provision  was  similar  to  $ 1981  except  that  it  focused, 
not upon rights to make and to enforce contracts, but rights 
related to the  ownership  of property.  The statute provides 
that  "[a]ll  citizens  of  the  United  States  shall  have  the  same 
right,  in  every  State  and  Territory,  as  is  enjoyed  by  white 
citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and con-
vey real and personal property."  $ 1982. 

Paul  E.  Sullivan,  a  white  man,  had  rented  his  house  to 
T. R. Freeman, Jr., a black man.  He had also assigned Free-
man  a  membership  share  in  a  corporation,  which  permitted 
the  owner  to  use  a  private  park  that  the  corporation  con-
trolled.  Because  of  Freeman's  race,  the  corporation,  Little 
Hunting Park, Inc., refused to approve the share assignment. 
And, when Sullivan protested, the association expelled Sulli-
van and took away his membership shares. 

Sullivan  sued  Little  Hunting  Park,  claiming  that  its  ac-
tions  violated  $ 1982.  The  Court  upheld  Sullivan's  claim.

Opinion of the Court 
It  found  that  the  corporation's  refusal  "to  approve  the  as-
signment  of the  membership share . . . was clearly an  inter-
ference  with  Freeman's  [the  black  lessee's]  right  to  `lease.' " 
396  U. S.,  at  237.  It  added  that  Sullivan,  the  white  lessor, 
"has standing to maintain this action," ibid., because, as the 
Court had previously said, "the white owner is at times `the 
only  effective  adversary'  of  the  unlawful  restrictive  cove-
nant."  Ibid.  (quoting  Barrows  v.  Jackson,  346  U. S.  249 
(1953)).  The  Court  noted  that  to  permit  the  corporation  to 
punish Sullivan "for trying to vindicate the rights of minori-
ties protected by $ 1982" would give "impetus to the perpetu-
ation  of  racial  restrictions  on  property."  396  U. S.,  at  237. 
And  this  Court  has  made  clear  that  Sullivan  stands  for  the 
proposition that $ 1982 encompasses retaliation claims.  See 
Jackson v.  Birmingham Bd. of Ed., 544 U. S. 167, 176 (2005) 
("[I]n  Sullivan  we  interpreted  a  general  prohibition  on  ra-
cial  discrimination  [in  $ 1982]  to  cover  retaliation  against 
those  who  advocate  the  rights  of  groups  protected  by  that 
prohibition"). 

While the Sullivan decision interpreted $ 1982, our prece-
dents  have  long  construed  $$ 1981  and  1982  similarly.  In 
Runyon v.  McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 173 (1976), the Court con-
sidered  whether  $ 1981  prohibits  private  acts  of  discrimina-
tion.  Citing Sullivan, along with Jones v.  Alfred H. Mayer 
Co.,  392  U. S.  409  (1968),  and  Tillman  v.  Wheaton-Haven 
Recreation  Assn.,  Inc.,  410  U. S.  431  (1973),  the  Court  rea-
soned that this case law "necessarily requires the conclusion 
that $ 1981, like $ 1982, reaches private conduct."  427 U. S., 
at  173.  See  also  id.,  at  187  (Powell,  J.,  concurring)  ("Al-
though  [Sullivan  and  Jones]  involved  $ 1982,  rather  than 

$ 1981, I agree that their considered holdings with respect to 
the purpose and meaning of $ 1982 necessarily apply to both 
statutes  in  view  of  their  common  derivation");  id.,  at  190 
(Stevens,

different  construction").  See  also  Shaare  Tefila  Congrega-
tion v.  Cobb, 481 U. S. 615, 617-618 (1987) (applying to $ 1982 
the  discussion  and  holding  of  Saint  Francis  College  v.  AlKhazraji,  481  U. S.  604,  609-613  (1987),  a  case  interpreting 

$ 1981). 

As  indicated  in  Runyon,  the  Court  has  construed  $$ 1981 
and  1982  alike  because  it  has  recognized  the  sister  statutes' 
common language, origin, and purposes.  Like $ 1981, $ 1982 
traces  its  origin  to  $ 1  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1866,  14 
Stat.  27.  See  General  Building  Contractors  Assn.,  Inc.  v. 
Pennsylvania,  458  U. S.  375,  383-384  (1982)  (noting  shared 
historical  roots  of  the  two  provisions);  Tillman,  supra,  at 
439-440  (same).  Like  $ 1981,  $ 1982  represents  an  immedi-
ately  post-Civil  War  legislative  effort to  guarantee  the  then 
newly  freed  slaves  the  same  legal  rights  that  other  citizens 
enjoy.  See  General  Building  Contractors  Assn.,  supra,  at 
388  (noting  strong  purposive  connection  between  the  two 
provisions).  Like  $ 1981,  $ 1982  uses  broad  language  that 
says  "[a]ll  citizens  of  the  United  States  shall  have  the  same 
right,  in  every  State  and  Territory,  as  is  enjoyed  by  white 
citizens  .  .  .  ."  Compare  $ 1981's  language  set  forth  above, 
supra,  at  445.  See  Jones,  supra,  at  441,  n.  78  (noting  the 
close  parallel  language  of  the  two  provisions).  Indeed, 

$ 1982  differs  from  $ 1981  only  in  that  it  refers,  not  to  the 
"right  .  .  .  to  make  and  enforce  contracts,"  42  U. S. C. 

$ 1981(a), but to the "right . . . to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, 
hold, and convey real and personal property," $ 1982. 

In  light  of  these  precedents,  it  is  not  surprising  that  fol-
lowing  Sullivan,  federal  appeals  courts  concluded,  on  the 
basis  of  Sullivan  or  its  reasoning,  that  $ 1981  encompassed 
retaliation  claims.  See,  e. g.,  Choudhury  v.  Polytechnic 
Inst. of N.  Y.,  735  F. 2d  38,  42-43 (CA2 1984);  Goff v.  Conti-
nental Oil Co., 678 F. 2d 593, 598-599 (CA5 1982), overruled, 
Carter  v.  South  Central  Bell,  912  F.  2d  832  (1990);  Win-
ston  v.  Lear-Siegler,  Inc.,  558  F.  2d  1266,  1270  (CA6  1977).

Opinion of the Court 

B 
In  1989,  20  years  after  Sullivan,  this  Court  in  Patterson v. 

McLean  Credit  Union,  491  U. S.  164,  significantly  limited the  scope  of  $ 1981.  The  Court focused  upon $ 1981's  words 

"to  make and  enforce  contracts"  and interpreted  the  phrase narrowly.  It  wrote  that  the  statutory  phrase  did  not  apply 
to  "conduct  by  the  employer  after  the  contract  relation  has been  established,  including  breach  of  the  terms  of  the  con-
tract  or  imposition  of  discriminatory  working  conditions." 
Id.,  at  177  (emphasis  added).  The  Court  added  that  the word  "enforce"  does  not  apply  to  post-contract-formation 

conduct  unless  the  discrimination  at  issue  "infects  the  legal process  in  ways  that  prevent  one  from  enforcing  contract 
rights."  Ibid.  (emphasis  added).  Thus  $ 1981  did  not  en-compass the claim of a black employee who charged that her 
employer had violated her employment contract by harassing her and failing to promote her, all because of her race. 

Ibid. Since  victims  of  an  employer's  retaliation  will  often  have 

opposed discriminatory conduct taking place after the forma-tion  of  the  employment  contract, 

Patterson's  holding,  for  a brief  time,  seems  in  practice  to  have  foreclosed  retaliation 

claims.  With one exception, we have found no federal court of  appeals  decision  between  the  time  we  decided 

Patterson and 1991 that permitted a $ 1981 retaliation claim to proceed. 

See,  e. g.,  Walker  v.  South  Central  Bell  Tel.  Co.,  904  F.  2d 275,  276  (CA5  1990)  (per  curiam);  Overby  v.  Chevron  USA, 
Inc.,  884  F. 2d  470,  473  (CA9  1989);  Sherman  v.  Burke  Con-
tracting,  Inc.,  891  F.  2d  1527,  1534-1535  (CA11  1990)  (per 
curiam).  See also Malhotra v.  Cotter & Co., 885 F. 2d 1305, 1312-1314 (CA7 1989) (questioning without deciding the via-

bility  of  retaliation  claims  under  $ 1981  after  Patterson). 
But  see  Hicks  v.  Brown  Group,  Inc.,  902  F.  2d 630,  635-638 (CA8 1990) (allowing a claim for discriminatory discharge to 

proceed  under  $ 1981),  vacated  and  remanded,  499  U. S.  914 (1991) (ordering  reconsideration in light of  what became  the

Opinion of the Court 
Eighth Circuit's en banc opinion in Taggart v.  Jefferson Cty. 
Child  Support  Enforcement  Unit,  935  F.  2d  947  (1991), 
which  held  that  racially  discriminatory  discharge  claims under $ 1981 are barred). 

In  1991,  however,  Congress  weighed  in  on  the  matter. Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991, 105 Stat. 1071, 
with  the  design  to  supersede  Patterson.  Jones  v.  R.  R. 
Donnelley & Sons Co., 541  U. S. 369, 383 (2004).  Insofar as is  relevant  here,  the  new  law  changed  42  U. S. C.  $ 1981  by 

reenacting  the  former  provision,  designating  it  as  $ 1981(a), and adding a new subsection, (b), which, says: 

" `Make and enforce contracts' defined 

"For purposes of this section, the term `make and en-
force contracts' includes the making, performance, modi-fication, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment 

of  all  benefits,  privileges,  terms,  and  conditions  of  the contractual relationship." 

An  accompanying  Senate  Report  pointed  out  that  the 
amendment  superseded  Patterson  by  adding  a  new  subsec-
tion  (b)  that  would  "reaffirm  that  the  right  `to  make  and enforce  contracts'  includes  the  enjoyment  of  all  benefits, 

privileges,  terms  and  conditions  of  the  contractual  relation-ship."  S.  Rep.  No.  101-315,  p.  6  (1990).  Among  other 
things,  it  would  "ensure  that  Americans  may  not  be  har-assed, 

fired  or  otherwise  discriminated  against  in  contracts 
because of their race."  Ibid. (emphasis added).  An accom-panying  House  Report  said  that  in  "cutting  back  the  scope 

of  the  rights  to  `make'  and  `enforce'  contracts[,]  Patterson . . . has been  interpreted to eliminate retaliation claims that 
the  courts  had  previously  recognized  under  section  1981." 
H.  R.  Rep.  No.  102-40,  pt.  1,  pp.  92-93,  n.  92  (1991).  It 
added  that  the  protections  that  subsection  (b)  provided,  in 
"the context of employment discrimination . . . would include, 
but not be limited to, claims of harassment, discharge, demo-
tion, promotion, transfer, retaliation, and hiring."  Id., at 92

Opinion of the Court 
(emphasis  added).  It  also  said  that  the  new  law  "would  re-store  rights  to  sue  for  such  retaliatory  conduct."  Id.,  at 

93, n. 92. After  enactment  of  the  new  law,  the  Federal  Courts  of 
Appeals  again  reached  a  broad  consensus  that  $ 1981,  as amended,  encompasses  retaliation  claims.  See,  e. g.,  Haw-
kins v.  1115 Legal Serv. Care, 163 F. 3d 684, 693 (CA2 1998); 
Aleman v.  Chugach Support Servs., Inc., 485 F. 3d 206, 213- 214 (CA4 2007); Foley  v.  University of Houston System, 355 

F. 3d 333, 338-339 (CA5 2003); Johnson v.  University of Cin-cinnati, 215 F. 3d 561, 575-576 (CA6 2000); 474 F. 3d, at 403 
(case  below);  Manatt  v.  Bank  of  America,  NA,  339  F.  3d 792,  800-801,  and  n.  11  (CA9  2003);  Andrews  v.  Lakeshore 
Rehabilitation  Hospital,  140  F.  3d  1405,  1411-1413  (CA11 1998). 

The  upshot  is  this:  (1)  In  1969,  Sullivan,  as  interpreted by Jackson, recognized that $ 1982 encompasses a retaliation 
action;  (2)  this  Court  has  long  interpreted  $$ 1981  and  1982 alike;  (3)  in  1989, 

Patterson,  without  mention  of  retaliation, narrowed $ 1981 by excluding from its scope conduct, namely, 

post-contract-formation  conduct,  where  retaliation  would most  likely  be  found;  but  in  1991,  Congress  enacted  legisla-
tion  that  superseded  Patterson  and  explicitly  defined  the scope  of  $ 1981  to  include  post-contract-formation  conduct; 
and  (4)  since  1991,  the  lower  courts  have  uniformly  inter-preted $ 1981 as encompassing retaliation actions. 

C 
Sullivan,  as  interpreted  and  relied  upon  by  Jackson,  as well  as  the  long  line  of  related  cases  where  we  construe 

$$ 1981 and  1982 similarly, lead us to conclude that the  view that $ 1981 encompasses retaliation claims is indeed well em-
bedded  in  the  law.  That  being  so,  considerations  of  stare 
decisis  strongly  support  our  adherence  to  that  view.  And those  considerations  impose  a  considerable  burden  upon 

those  who  would  seek  a  different  interpretation  that  would

Opinion of the Court 
necessarily unsettle many Court precedents.  See, e. g., Welch  v.  Texas  Dept.  of  Highways  and  Public  Transp.,  483 

U. S.  468,  494-495  (1987)  (plurality  opinion)  (describing  im-portance of stare decisis); Patterson, 491 U. S., at 172 (consid-
erations  of  stare  decisis  "have  special  force  in  the  area  of statutory  interpretation"); 

John  R.  Sand  &  Gravel  Co.  v. United States, 552 U. S. 130, 139 (2008) (same). 

III 
In our view, CBOCS' several arguments, taken separately or  together,  cannot  justify  a  departure  from  what  we  have 

just described as the well-embedded interpretation of $ 1981. First,  CBOCS  points  to the  plain  text  of $ 1981--a  text that 
says that "[a]ll persons . . . shall have the same right . . . to make  and  enforce  contracts  .  .  .  as  is  enjoyed  by  white citi-
zens."  42 U. S. C. $ 1981(a) (emphasis added).  CBOCS adds that,  insofar  as  Humphries  complains  of  retaliation,  he  is 
complaining  of  a  retaliatory  action  that  the  employer  would have  taken  against him  whether  he  was  black or  white,  and 
there  is  no  way  to  construe  this  text  to  cover  that  kind  of deprivation.  Thus  the  text's  language,  CBOCS  concludes, 
simply "does not provide for a cause of action based on retali-ation."  Brief for Petitioner 8. 

We  agree  with  CBOCS  that  the  statute's  language  does not  expressly  refer  to  the  claim  of  an  individual  (black  or 
white)  who  suffers  retaliation  because  he  has  tried  to  help a  different  individual,  suffering  direct  racial  discrimination, 
secure his $ 1981 rights.  But that fact alone is not sufficient to  carry  the  day.  After  all,  this  Court  has  long  held  that 
the  statutory  text  of  $ 1981's  sister  statute,  $ 1982,  provides protection  from  retaliation  for  reasons  related  to  the 

en-
forcement of the express statutory right.  See supra, at 447. Moreover,  the  Court  has  recently  read  another  broadly 

worded civil rights statute, namely, Title IX of the Education Amendments  of  1972,  86  Stat.  373,  as  amended,  20  U. S. C. 

$ 1681  et  seq.,  as  including  an  antiretaliation  remedy.  In

Opinion of the Court 
2005 in Jackson, the Court considered whether statutory lan-guage prohibiting "discrimination [on the basis of sex] under 

any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,"  $ 1681(a),  encompassed  claims  of  retaliation  for 
complaints  about  sex  discrimination.  544  U. S.,  at  173-174. Despite the fact that Title IX does not use the word "retalia-
tion,"  the Court  held  in  Jackson  that  the  statute's  language 
encompassed  such  a  claim,  in  part  because:  (1)  "Congress enacted  Title  IX  just  three  years  after 

Sullivan  was 
decided";  (2)  it  is  " `realistic  to  presume  that  Congress  was thoroughly familiar' " with 

Sullivan; and (3) Congress conse-
quently " `expected its enactment' " of Title IX " `to be inter-
preted  in  conformity  with' "  Sullivan.  544  U. S.,  at  176. 
The  Court in  Jackson  explicitly  rejected  the  arguments  the 
dissent advances here--that Sullivan was merely a standing 
case, see post, at 464-467 (opinion of Thomas,

454  CBOCS  WEST,  INC.  v.  HUMPHRIES 

Opinion of the Court 
sion  primarily  upon  the  fact  that  Congress  did  not  include an 

explicit antiretaliation provision or the word "retaliation" 
in  the  new  statutory  language--although  Congress  has  in-cluded  explicit  antiretaliation  language  in  other  civil  rights 

statutes.  See, e. g., National Labor Relations  Act,  29 U. S. C.  $ 158(a)(4);  Fair  Labor  Standards  Act  of  1938,  29 
U. S. C. $ 215(a)(3);  Title VII of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42  U

. S. C.  $ 2000e-3(a);  Age  Discrimination  in  Employment Act  of  1967,  29  U. S. C.  $ 623(d);  Americans with  Disabilities 

Act  of  1990,  42  U. S. C.  $$ 12203(a)-(b);  Family  and  Medical Leave Act of 1993, 29 U. S. C. $ 2615. 

We  believe,  however,  that  the  circumstances  to  which 
CBOCS  points  find  a  far  more  plausible  explanation  in  the 
fact  that,  given  Sullivan  and  the  new  statutory  language 
nullifying  Patterson,  there  was  no  need  for  Congress  to  in-
clude explicit language about retaliation.  After all, the 1991 
amendments  themselves  make  clear  that  Congress  intended 
to  supersede  the  result  in  Patterson  and  embrace  prePatterson  law.  And  pre-Patterson  law  included  Sullivan. 
See  Part  II,  supra.  Nothing  in  the  statute's  text  or  in  the 
surrounding circumstances suggests any congressional effort 
to supersede Sullivan or the interpretation that courts have 
subsequently  given  that  case.  To  the  contrary,  the  amend-
ments'  history  indicates  that  Congress  intended  to  restore 
that  interpretation.  See,  e. g.,  H.  R.  Rep.  No.  102-40,  at  92 
(noting that $ 1981(b) in the "context of employment discrimi-
nation . . . would include . . . claims of . . . retaliation"). 

Third,  CBOCS  points  out  that  $ 1981,  if  applied  to 
employment-related  retaliation  actions,  would  overlap  with 
Title  VII.  It  adds  that  Title  VII  requires  that  those  who 
invoke  its  remedial  powers  satisfy  certain  procedural  and 
administrative  requirements  that  $ 1981  does  not  contain. 
See, e. g., 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(e)(1) (charge of discrimination 
must  be  brought  before  EEOC  within  180  days  of  the  dis-
criminatory  act);  $ 2000e-5(f)(1)  (suit  must  be  filed  within 
90  days  of  obtaining  an  EEOC  right-to-sue  letter).  And

Opinion of the Court 
CBOCS  says  that  permitting  a  $ 1981  retaliation  action would  allow  a  retaliation  plaintiff  to  circumvent  Title  VII's 

"specific administrative and  procedural  mechanisms, " thereby  undermining  their  effectiveness.  Brief  for  Peti-
tioner 25. This  argument, however, proves too much.  Precisely the 
same kind of Title VII/$ 1981 "overlap" and potential circum-
vention  exists  in  respect  to  employment-related  direct  dis-crimination.  Yet Congress explicitly created the overlap in 

respect to direct employment discrimination.  Nor is it obvi-ous  how  we  can  interpret  $ 1981  to  avoid 

employment-
related  overlap  without  eviscerating  $ 1981  in  respect  to 
non-employment contracts where no such overlap exists. 

Regardless,  we  have  previously  acknowledged  a  "neces-
sary overlap" between Title VII and $ 1981.  Patterson, 491 
U. S.,  at  181.  We  have  added  that  the  "remedies  available 
under  Title  VII  and  under  $ 1981,  although  related,  and 
although  directed  to  most  of  the  same  ends,  are  separate, 
distinct,  and  independent."  Johnson  v.  Railway  Express 
Agency, Inc., 421 U. S. 454, 461 (1975).  We have pointed out 
that  Title  VII  provides  important  administrative  remedies 
and other benefits that $ 1981 lacks.  See id., at 457-458 (de-
tailing  the  benefits  of  Title  VII  to  those  aggrieved  by  race-
based employment discrimination).  And we have concluded 
that "Title VII was designed to supplement, rather than sup-
plant,  existing  laws  and  institutions  relating  to  employment 
discrimination."  Alexander  v.  Gardner-Denver  Co.,  415 

U. S.  36,  48-49  (1974).  In  a  word,  we  have  previously  held 
that  the  "overlap"  reflects  congressional  design.  See  ibid. 
We  have  no  reason  to  reach  a  different  conclusion  in  this 
case. 

Fourth, CBOCS says it finds support for its position in two 
of  our  recent  cases,  Burlington  N.  &  S.  F.  R.  Co.  v.  White, 
548  U. S.  53  (2006),  and  Domino's  Pizza,  Inc.  v.  McDonald, 
546  U. S.  470  (2006).  In  Burlington,  a  Title  VII  case,  we 
distinguished between discrimination that harms individuals

456  CBOCS  WEST,  INC.  v.  HUMPHRIES 

Opinion of the Court 
because of "who they are, i. e., their status," for example, as women  or  as  black  persons,  and  discrimination  that  harms 

"individuals  based  on  what  they  do,  i. e.,  their  conduct,"  for example,  whistle-blowing  that  leads  to  retaliation.  548 
U. S.,  at  63.  CBOCS  says  that  we  should  draw  a  similar distinction  here  and  conclude  that  $ 1981  only  encompasses 
status-based  discrimination.  In  Burlington,  however,  we 
used the status/conduct distinction to help explain why Con-gress might have wanted its explicit Title VII antiretaliation 

provision to sweep more broadly (i. e., to include conduct out-
side  the  workplace)  than  its  substantive  Title  VII  (status-
based)  antidiscrimination  provision.  Burlington  did  not 
suggest  that  Congress  must  separate  the  two  in  all  events. 

The  dissent  argues  that  the  distinction  made  in  Burling-
ton is  meaningful  here  because  it  purportedly  "underscores 
the  fact  that  status-based  discrimination  and  conduct-based 
retaliation are distinct harms that call for tailored legislative 
treatment."  Post, at 462.  The Court's construction of a gen-
eral ban on discrimination such as that contained in $ 1981 to 
cover  retaliation  claims,  the  dissent  continues,  would  some-
how  render  the  separate  antiretaliation  provisions  in  other 
statutes "superfluous."  Ibid.  But the Court in Burlington 
did not find that Title VII's antiretaliation provision was re-
dundant; it found that the provision had a broader reach than 
the  statute's  substantive  provision.  And  in  any  case,  we 
have held that "legislative enactments in this area have long 
evinced  a  general  intent  to  accord  parallel  or  overlapping 
remedies  against  discrimination."  Alexander,  supra,  at  47. 
See Great American Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v.  Novotny, 442 
U. S.  366,  377  (1979)  ("[S]ubstantive  rights  conferred  in  the 
19th  century  [civil  rights  Acts]  were  not  withdrawn,  sub  si-
lentio,  by  the  subsequent  passage  of  the  modern  statutes"). 
Accordingly, the Court has accepted overlap between a num-
ber  of  civil  rights  statutes.  See  ibid.  (discussing  interrela-
tion of fair housing provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 
and  $ 1982;  between  $ 1981  and  Title  VII).  See  also  supra,

Opinion of the Court 
This  reasoning  improperly conflates  the  question  whether 
a  statute  confers  a  private  right  of  action  with  the  ques-
tion  whether  the  statute's  substantive  prohibition  reaches  a 
particular  form  of  conduct.  These  questions  are  analyti-
cally distinct, and confusing them would lead to exceedingly 
strange results. 

For example, under the Court of Appeals' reasoning, Title 
IX's  prohibition  of  "discrimination"  "on  the  basis  of  sex,"  in 
20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a), might have a narrower scope and might 
not  reach  retaliation  if  Title  IX  contained  a  provision  ex-
pressly authorizing an aggrieved private party to bring suit 
to  remedy a  violation of  $ 1681(a).  We  do not  see  how  such 
a  conclusion  could  be  defended.  Section  1681(a)'s  prohibi-
tion of "discrimination" either does or does not reach retalia-
tion, and the presence or absence of another statutory provi-
sion expressly creating a private right of action cannot alter 

$ 1681(a)'s  scope.  In  addition,  it  would  be  perverse  if  the 
enactment  of  a  provision  explicitly  creating  a  private  right 
of  action--a  provision  that,  if  anything,  would  tend  to  sug-
gest  that  Congress  perceived  a  need  for  a  strong  remedy-- 
were  taken  as  a  justification  for  narrowing  the  scope  of  the 
underlying prohibition. 

The Court of Appeals' reasoning also seems to lead to the 
strange conclusion that, despite Jackson's holding that a pri-
vate party may assert a retaliation claim under Title IX, the 
Federal Government might not be authorized to impose upon 
an entity that engages in retaliation the administrative rem-
edies,  including  the  termination  of  funding,  that  are  ex-
pressly  sanctioned  under  $ 1682.  It  would  be  extremely 
odd, however, if $ 1681(a) had a broader scope when enforced 
by a means not expressly  sanctioned by statute than it does 
when  enforced  by  the  means  that  the  statute  explicitly  pro-
vides.  For  these  reasons,  we  reject  the  proposition  that

Congress  had  reason  to  include  a  specific  prohibition  of retaliation, $ 623(d), in order to dispel any such inference. 

The  ADEA  federal-sector  provision,  however,  was  not modeled after $ 623(d) and is couched in very different terms. 
The ADEA federal-sector  provision was patterned "directly after"  Title  VII's  federal-sector  discrimination  ban.

Opinion of the Court 
federal department, agency, or other entity covered by $ 633a "shall not be subject to, or affected by, any provisions of this 

chapter"  other  than  $$ 633a  and  631(b),  the  provisions  that restrict  the  coverage  of  the  ADEA  to  persons  who  are  at 
least 40 years of age.  Respondent contends that recognizing federal-sector  retaliation  claims  would  be  tantamount  to 
making  $ 623(d)  applicable  to  federal-sector  employers  and would thus contravene $ 633a(f). 

This  argument  is  unsound  because  our  holding  that  the ADEA prohibits retaliation against federal-sector employees 
is not in any way based on $ 623(d).  Our conclusion, instead, is based squarely on $ 633a(a) itself, "unaffected by other sec-
tions" of the ADEA.  Lehman,

with the funds' illegitimate character, but that does not mean that Con-
gress  intended  nature  to  swallow  the  other  attributes.  The  Court  is 
likewise  skeptical  of  petitioner's  argument  that  violating  the  statute's 
elements would necessarily have the effect of making the funds appear 
more  legitimate  than  they  did  before.  It  is  not  necessarily  true  that 
concealing  or  disguising  any  one  of  the  listed  attributes  may  have  the 
effect of making the funds appear more legitimate by impeding law en-
forcement's ability to identify illegitimate funds.  Finally, the Court dis-
agrees  with  petitioner's  argument  that  $ 1956(a)(2)  must  be  aimed  at 
something other than merely secretive transportation of illicit funds be-
cause that conduct is already punished by the bulk cash smuggling stat-
ute, 31  U. S. C. $ 5332.  Even  if  $ 1956(a)(2)(B)(i)  has no  "appearance of 
legitimate wealth" requirement, the two statutes nonetheless target dis-
tinct  conduct, in that $ 5332(a)(1)  encompasses, inter

release. On  appeal,  a  divided  panel  of  the  Fifth  Circuit  reversed 
and rendered a judgment of acquittal.  441 F. 3d 329 (2006). Judge  Smith's  majority  opinion  held  that,  although  the  evi-
dence  showed  that  petitioner  concealed  the  money  for  the purpose of transporting it, the statute requires that the pur-
pose  of  the  transportation  itself  must  be  to  conceal  or  dis-guise  the  unlawful  proceeds.

A 
We  first  consider  the  "designed  . . . to  conceal"  element. Petitioner  argues  that  to  satisfy  this  element,  the  Govern-

ment must prove that the defendant attempted to create the appearance  of  legitimate  wealth.  Petitioner  would  replace 
"designed . . . to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, 
the  source,  the  ownership,  or  the  control  of  the  proceeds" with  "designed  to  create  the  appearance  of  legitimate 

wealth. "  $ 1956(a)(2)(B)(i).  This is consistent with the plain  meaning  of "money  laundering," petitioner  argues, be-
cause that term is commonly understood to mean disguising 

2 Subsection (a)(2) reads, in its entirety: 
"Whoever  transports,  transmits,  or  transfers,  or  attempts  to  transport, 
transmit, or transfer a monetary instrument or funds  from a place  in the 
United States to or through a place outside the United States or to a place 
in the United States from or through a place outside the United States-- 

"(A)  with  the  intent  to  promote  the  carrying  on  of  specified  unlawful 
activity; or 

"(B)  knowing  that  the  monetary  instrument  or  funds  involved  in  the 
transportation,  transmission,  or  transfer  represent  the  proceeds  of  some 
form of unlawful activity and knowing that such transportation, transmis-
sion, or transfer is designed in whole or in part-- 

"(i)  to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the own-
ership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity; or 

"(ii)  to  avoid  a  transaction  reporting  requirement  under  State  or  Fed-
eral law, 

"shall be sentenced to a fine of not more than $500,000 or twice the value 
of the monetary instrument or funds involved in the transportation, trans-
mission,  or  transfer  whichever  is  greater,  or  imprisonment  for  not  more 
than twenty  years, or  both.  For  the  purpose  of the  offense described in 
subparagraph (B), the defendant's knowledge may be established by proof 
that a law enforcement officer represented the matter specified in subpara-
graph  (B)  as  true,  and  the  defendant's  subsequent  statements  or  actions 
indicate that the defendant believed such representations to be true."

Opinion of the Court 
conceal or disguise the location,  ownership, or control of the 
funds.  For  example,  a  defendant  who  smuggles  cash  into 
Mexico with the intent of hiding it from authorities by bury-
ing  it  in  the  desert  may  have  engaged  in  transportation  de-
signed to conceal the location of those funds, but his conduct 
would  not  necessarily  have  the  effect  of  making  the  funds 
appear legitimate. 

Nor  do  we  find  persuasive  petitioner's  attempt  to  infuse 
a  "classic  money  laundering"  requirement  into  the  listed 
attributes.  Contrary  to  petitioner's  argument,  revealing 
those attributes--nature, location, source, ownership, or con-
trol--would  not  necessarily  expose  the  illegitimacy  of  the 
funds.  Digging  up  the  cash  buried  in  the  Mexican  desert, 
for example, would not necessarily reveal that it was derived 
from  unlawful  activity.  Indeed,  of  all  the  listed  attributes, 
only  "nature"  is  coextensive  with  the  funds'  illegitimate 
character:  Exposing  the  nature  of  illicit  funds  would,  by 
definition,  reveal  them as unlawful proceeds.  But  nature is 
only one attribute in the statute; that it may be coextensive 
with the creation of the appearance of legitimate wealth does 
not  mean  that  Congress  intended  that  requirement  to  swal-
low the other listed attributes. 

We likewise are skeptical of petitioner's argument that vi-
olating  the  elements  of  the  statute  would  necessarily  have 
the  effect  of  making  the  funds  appear  more  legitimate  than 
they did before.  It is true that concealing or disguising any 
one of the listed attributes may have the effect of making the 
funds appear more legitimate--largely because concealing or 
disguising  those  attributes  might  impede  law  enforcement's 
ability  to  identify  illegitimate  funds--but  we  are  not  con-
vinced that this is necessarily so.  It might be possible for a 
defendant  to  conceal  or  disguise  a  listed  attribute  without 
also  creating  the  appearance  of  legitimate  wealth.  Cf.

ishes the  mere transportation  of lawfully  derived  proceeds.3 Compare  31  U. S. C.  $ 5332(a)  (omitting  any  requirement 

that  the  funds  be  unlawfully  derived)  with  18  U. S. C. $ 1956(a)(2)(B)  (requiring  that  the  defendant  "kno[w]  that 
the  monetary  instrument  or  funds  involved  in  the  trans-portation . . . represent the proceeds of some form of unlaw-
ful activity").  B 

Having concluded that the statute contains no "appearance of legitimate wealth" requirement, we next consider whether 
the  evidence  that  petitioner  concealed  the  money  during transportation  is  sufficient  to  sustain  his  conviction.  As 
noted, petitioner was convicted under $ 1956(a)(2)(B)(i), which, in relevant part, makes it a crime to attempt to trans-
port  "funds  from  a  place  in  the  United  States  to  . .  .  a  place outside  the  United  States  .  .  .  knowing  that  the  .  .  .  funds 
involved in the  transportation . . . represent the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity and knowing that such trans-
portation . . .  is  designed  in  whole  or  in  part  .  .  .  to  conceal or  disguise  the  nature,  the  location,  the  source,  the  owner-
ship,  or  the  control  of  the  proceeds  of  specified  unlawful  ac-tivity."  Accordingly,  the  Government  was  required  in  this 
case to prove that petitioner (1) attempted to transport funds from the United States to Mexico, (2) knew that these funds 
"represent[ed]  the  proceeds  of  some  form  of  unlawful  activ-ity,"

apply whenever a person transported illicit funds in a secre-tive manner.  Judge Smith  supplied  an example  of this  con-

struction:  A  petty  thief  who  hides  money  in  his  shoe  and then  walks  across  the  border  to  spend  the  money  in  local 
bars,  see  478  F.  3d,  at  301  (dissenting  opinion),  has  engaged in  transportation  designed  to  conceal  the  location  of  the 
money because he has hidden it in an unlikely place. We  think  it  implausible,  however,  that  Congress  intended 
this meaning of "design."  If it had, it could have expressed its intention simply by writing "knowing that such transpor-
tation  conceals  or  disguises,"  rather  than  the  more  complex formulation  "knowing  that  such  transportation . . . is de-
signed  .  .  .  to  conceal  or  disguise."  $ 1956(a)(2)(B)(i).  It seems far more likely that Congress intended courts to apply 
the familiar criminal law concepts of purpose and intent than to  focus  exclusively  on  how  a  defendant  "structured"  the 
transportation.  In  addition,  the  structural  meaning  of  "de-sign" is both overinclusive and underinclusive: It would cap-
ture individuals who structured transportation in a secretive way but lacked any criminal intent (such as a person who hid

the  limited  availability  of  qualified  attorneys  or  agents for  the  proceedings  involved,  justifies  a  higher  fee.)" 

$ 504(b)(1)(A).3 
In this  case, Richlin "incurred" "fees"  for paralegal services in  connection  with  its  contract  action  before  the  Board. 

Since $ 504(b)(1)(A) awards fees at "prevailing market rates," a straightforward reading of the statute leads to the conclu-
sion  that  Richlin  was  entitled  to  recover  fees  for  the  para-legal  services  it  purchased  at  the  market  rate  for  such 
services. The  Government  resists  this  reading  by  distinguishing 
"fees"  from  "other  expenses."  The  Government  concedes that  "fees"  are  reimbursable  at  "prevailing  market  rates," 
but  it  insists  that  "other  expenses"  (including  expenses  for "any  study,  analysis,  engineering  report,  test,  or  project") 
are reimbursable only at their "reasonable cost."  And in the Government's view, outlays for paralegal services are better 
characterized as "other expenses" than as "fees."  The Gov-ernment observes that the second sentence of $ 504(b)(1)(A), 
which  explains  how  to  calculate  awards  for  "fees,"  refers  to attorneys, agents, and expert witnesses, without mentioning 
paralegals.  From this omission, the Government infers that Congress  intended  to  treat  expenditures  for  paralegal  serv-
ices  not  as  "fees"  but  as  "other  expenses,"  recoverable  at "reasonable cost." 

We  find  the  Government's  fractured  interpretation  of  the statute  unpersuasive.  Contrary  to  the  Government's  con-
tention,  $ 504(b)(1)(A)  does  not  clearly  distinguish  between 

3 Virtually identical fee-shifting provisions apply to actions by or against 
the  Government  in  federal  court.  See  28  U. S. C.  $$ 2412(a)(1),  (d)(2)(A). 
The  question  presented  addresses  both  $$ 504  and  2412,  but  the  Federal 
Circuit's decision resolved only petitioner's $ 504 application, and the Gov-
ernment avers (without challenge from Richlin) that $ 2412 "is not at issue 
in this case."  Brief for Respondent 2, n. 1.  We assume without deciding 
that the reasoning of our opinion would extend equally to $$ 504 and 2412. 
We confine our discussion to $ 504.

Opinion of the Court 
But even if we agreed that EAJA limited a prevailing par-ty's  recovery  for  paralegal  fees  to  "reasonable  cost,"  it  cer-

tainly  would  not  follow  that  the  cost  should  be  measured from  the  perspective  of  the  party's  attorney.

4  To  the  con-

trary,  it  would  be  anomalous  to  measure  cost  from  the  per-spective  of  the  attorney  rather  than  the  client.  We  do  not 

understand  the  Government  to  contend,  for  example,  that 
the  "reasonable  cost"  of  an  "engineering  report"  or  "analy-sis"  should  be  calculated  from  the  perspective  of  the  firm 

that  employs  the  engineer  or  analyst.  Such  an  interpreta-tion  would  be  tough  to  square  with  the  statutory  language, 
which  provides  that  an  agency  shall  award  to  a  prevailing party  "fees  and  other  expenses

practice provides by far the more transparent basis for calcu-lating a prevailing party's recovery under EAJA.  It strains 

credulity that  Congress would have  abandoned  this  predict-able,  workable  framework  for  the  uncertain  and  complex 
accounting requirements that a cost-based rule would inflict on  litigants,  their  attorneys,  administrative  agencies,  and 
the courts.  IV 

Confronted with the flaws in its interpretation of the stat-ute, the Government seeks shelter in a canon of construction. 
According to the Government, any right to recover paralegal fees under EAJA must be read narrowly in light of the statu-
tory canon requiring strict construction of waivers of sover-eign immunity.  We disagree. 

The sovereign immunity canon is just that--a canon of con-struction.  It is a tool for interpreting the law, and we have 
never held that it displaces the other traditional tools of stat-utory construction.  Indeed, the cases on which the Govern-
ment  relies  all  used  other  tools  of  construction  in  tandem with the sovereign immunity canon.  See

give  way  to  the  requirements  of  the  government  as  employer.  See, 
e. g., Connick v.  Myers, 461 U. S. 138.  Pp. 597-600. 

(b)  The Court's equal protection jurisprudence has typically been con-
cerned  with  governmental  classifications  that  "affect  some  groups  of 
citizens differently than others."  McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420, 
425.  Olech did recognize that a class-of-one equal protection claim can 
in  some  circumstances  be  sustained.  Its  recognition  of  that  theory, 
however, was not so much a departure from the principle that the Equal 
Protection Clause is concerned with arbitrary government classification, 
as  it  was  an  application  of  that  principle  to  the  facts  in  that  case:  The 
government singled Olech out with regard to its regulation of property, 
and  the  cases  upon  which  the  Court  relied  concerned  property  assess-
ment and taxation schemes that were applied in a singular way to par-
ticular citizens.  What seems to have been significant in Olech and the 
cited  cases  was  the  existence  of  a  clear  standard  against  which  depar-
tures, even for a single plaintiff, could be readily assessed.  This differ-
ential  treatment  raised  a  concern  of  arbitrary  classification,  and  there-
fore  required that  the State  provide  a  rational basis  for it.  There  are 
some forms of state action, however, which by their nature involve dis-
cretionary decisionmaking based on a vast array of subjective, individu-
alized  assessments.  In  such  cases  treating  like  individuals  differently 
is  an  accepted  consequence  of  the  discretion  granted  to  governmental 
officials.  This principle applies most clearly in the employment context, 
where  decisions  are  often  subjective  and  individualized,  resting  on  a 
wide  array  of  factors  that are  difficult  to  articulate and  quantify.  Un-
like  the  context  of  arm's-length  regulation,  such  as  in  Olech,  treating 
seemingly  similarly  situated  individuals  differently  in  the  employment 
context  is  par  for  the  course.  It  is  no  proper  challenge  to  what  in  its 
nature is a subjective and individualized decision that it was subjective 
and individualized.  That the Court has never found the Equal Protec-
tion Clause implicated in this area is not surprising, given the historical 
understanding  of  the  at-will  nature  of  government  employment.  See, 
e. g.,  McElroy,  supra,  at  896.  Recognition  of  a  claim  that  the  State 
treated an employee differently from others for a bad reason, or for no 
reason  at  all,  is  simply  contrary  to  the  at-will  concept.  The  Constitu-
tion  does  not  require  repudiating  that  familiar  doctrine.  Finally,  the 
Court  is  guided,  as  in  the  past,  by  the  "common-sense  realization  that 
government offices could not function if every employment decision be-
came a constitutional matter."  Connick, supra, at 143.  If class-of-one 
claims were recognized in the employment context, any personnel action 
in  which  a  wronged  employee  can  conjure  up  a  claim  of  differential 
treatment would suddenly become the basis for a federal constitutional 
claim.  The  Equal  Protection  Clause  does  not  require  "[t]his  displace-

Szczepanski  chose  Hyatt  despite  Engquist's  greater  experi-ence  in  the  relevant  field.  Later  that  year,  during  a  round 

of across-the-board budget cuts in Oregon, Szczepanski elim-inated  Corristan's  position.  Finally,  on  January  31,  2002, 
Engquist  was  informed  that  her  position  was  being  elimi-nated because of reorganization.  Engquist's collective-
bargaining  agreement  gave  her  the  opportunity  either  to 
"bump"  to  another  position  at  her  level,  or  to  take  a  demo-tion.  She  was  found  unqualified  for  the  only  other  position 

at her level and declined a demotion, and was therefore effec-tively laid off. 

Engquist  subsequently  brought  suit  in  the  United  States 
District  Court  for  the  District  of  Oregon  against  ODA, 
Szczepanski, and Hyatt, all respondents here, alleging viola-
tions  of  federal  antidiscrimination  statutes,  the  Equal  Pro-
tection  and  Due  Process  Clauses  of  the  Fourteenth  Amend-
ment,  and  state  law.  As  to  Engquist's  equal  protection 
claim, she  alleged that  the  defendants discriminated  against 
her  on  the  basis  of  her  race,  sex,  and  national  origin.  She 
also brought what is known as a "class-of-one" equal protec-
tion claim, alleging that she was fired not because she was a 
member  of  an  identified  class  (unlike  her  race,  sex,  and  na-
tional  origin  claims),  but  simply  for  "arbitrary,  vindictive, 
and malicious reasons."  App. 10. 

The  District  Court  granted  the  respondents'  motion  for 
summary  judgment  as  to  some  of  Engquist's  claims,  but  al-
lowed others to go forward, including each  of the  equal pro-
tection  claims.  As  relevant  to  this  case,  the  District  Court 
found  Engquist's  class-of-one  equal  protection  claim  legally 
viable,  deciding  that  the  class-of-one  theory  was  fully  appli-
cable  in  the  employment  context.  Civ.  No.  02-1637-AS  (D 
Ore., Sept. 14, 2004), App. 49, 58, 2004 WL 2066748, *5.  The 
court held that Engquist could succeed on that theory if she 
could prove "that she was singled out as a result of animosity 
on  the  part  of  Hyatt  and  Szczepanski"--i. e.,  "that  their  ac-
tions  were  spiteful  efforts  to  punish  her  for  reasons  unre-

lated  to  any  legitimate  state  objective"--and  if  she  could demonstrate,  on  the  basis  of  that  animosity,  that  "she  was 

treated  differently  than  others  who  were  similarly  situ-ated." 

Ibid. 
The  jury  rejected  Engquist's  claims  of  discrimination  for membership  in  a  suspect  class--her  race,  sex,  and  national 

origin  claims--but  found  in  her  favor  on  the  class-of-one 
claim.  Specifically, the jury found that Hyatt and Szczepan-ski "intentionally treat[ed] [Engquist] differently than others 

similarly  situated  with  respect  to  the  denial  of  her  promo-tion,  termination  of  her  employment,  or  denial  of  bumping 
rights without any rational basis and solely for arbitrary, vin-
dictive  or  malicious  reasons."  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  3-4. 
The  jury  also  found  for  Engquist  on  several  of  her  other 
claims,  and  awarded  her  $175,000  in  compensatory  damages 
and $250,000 in punitive damages. 

The Court of Appeals reversed in relevant part.  It recog-
nized that this Court had upheld a class-of-one equal protec-
tion  challenge  to  state  legislative  and  regulatory  action  in 
Village  of  Willowbrook  v.  Olech,  528  U. S.  562  (2000)  (per 
curiam).  478  F.  3d  985,  992-993  (CA9  2007).  The  court 
below  also  acknowledged  that  other  Circuits  had  applied 
Olech  in  the  public  employment  context,  478  F.  3d,  at  993 
(citing  cases),  but  it  disagreed  with  those  courts  on  the 
ground  that  our  cases  have  routinely  afforded  government 
greater leeway when it acts as employer rather than regula-
tor, id., at 993-996.  The court concluded that extending the 
class-of-one theory of equal protection to the  public employ-
ment  context  would  lead  to  undue  judicial  interference  in 
state  employment  practices  and  "completely  invalidate  the 
practice  of  public  at-will  employment."  Id.,  at  995.  The 
court  accordingly  held  that  the  class-of-one  theory  is  "inap-
plicable  to  decisions  made  by  public  employers  with  regard 
to their employees."  Id., at 996. 

Judge Reinhardt dissented, "agree[ing] with the other cir-
cuits that the class-of-one theory of equal protection is appli-

cable  to  public  employment  decisions."  Id.,  at  1010.  We granted  certiorari to  resolve  this disagreement  in  the  lower 

courts, 552 U. S. 1136 (2008), and now affirm. 

II 
Engquist  argues that the  Equal Protection Clause forbids public  employers  from  irrationally  treating  one  employee 

differently  from  others  similarly  situated,  regardless  of whether  the  different  treatment  is  based  on  the  employee's 
membership in a particular class.  She reasons that in Olech, supra,  we  recognized  in  the  regulatory  context  a  similar 
class-of-one  theory  of  equal  protection,  Brief  for  Petitioner 14-15; that the Equal Protection Clause protects individuals, 
not classes, id., at 15-17; that the Clause proscribes "discrim-ination  arising  not  only  from  a  legislative  act  but  also  from 
the  conduct  of  an  administrative  official,"  id.,  at  17;  and that  the  Constitution  applies  to  the  State  not  only  when  it 
acts  as  regulator,  but  also  when  it  acts  as  employer,  id.,  at 23-29.  Thus,  Engquist  concludes  that  class-of-one  claims 
can be  brought against  public  employers just as against  any other  state  actors, 

id.,  at  29-32,  and  that  differential  treat-ment  of  government  employees--even  when  not  based  on 

membership  in  a  class  or  group--violates  the  Equal  Protec-tion  Clause  unless  supported  by  a  rational  basis,  id.,  at  32, 
39-45. We  do  not  quarrel  with  the  premises  of  Engquist's  argu-
ment.  It  is  well  settled  that  the  Equal  Protection  Clause "protect[s] persons, not groups," Adarand Constructors, Inc. 
v.  Pen~ a, 515 U. S. 200, 227 (1995) (emphasis deleted), and that the  Clause's  protections  apply  to  administrative  as  well  as 
legislative  acts,  see,  e. g.,  Raymond  v.  Chicago  Union  Trac-tion Co., 207 U. S. 20, 35-36 (1907).  It is equally well settled 
that States do not escape the strictures of the Equal Protec-tion Clause in  their  role as employers.  See, 

e. g.,  New  York City  Transit  Authority  v.  Beazer,  440  U. S.  568  (1979); 

Harrah  Independent  School  Dist.  v.  Martin,  440  U. S.  194

Opinion of the Court 
(1979)  (per  curiam);  Massachusetts  Bd.  of  Retirement  v. Murgia, 427 U. S. 307 (1976) (per curiam).  We do not, how-

ever,  agree  that  Engquist's  conclusion  follows  from  these premises.  Our  traditional  view  of  the  core  concern  of  the 
Equal Protection Clause as a shield against arbitrary  classi-fications,  combined  with  unique  considerations  applicable 
when the government acts as employer as opposed to sover-eign, lead us to conclude that the class-of-one theory of equal 
protection does not apply in the  public employment context. 

A 
We  have  long  held  the  view  that  there  is  a  crucial  differ-ence,  with  respect  to  constitutional  analysis,  between  the 

government  exercising "the  power to regulate or license, as lawmaker,"  and  the  government  acting  "as  proprietor,  to 
manage  [its]  internal  operation."  Cafeteria  &  Restaurant Workers v.  McElroy, 367 U. S. 886, 896 (1961).  This distinc-
tion has been particularly clear in our review of state action in  the  context  of  public  employment.  Thus,  "the  govern-
ment  as  employer  indeed  has  far  broader  powers  than  does the  government  as  sovereign." 

Waters  v.  Churchill,  511 U. S. 661, 671 (1994) (plurality opinion).  "[T]he extra power 

the  government  has  in  this  area  comes  from  the  nature  of the  government's  mission  as  employer.  Government  agen-
cies are charged by law with doing particular tasks.  Agen-cies hire employees to help do those tasks as effectively and 
efficiently  as  possible."  Id.,  at  674-675.  See  also  Connick v.  Myers,  461  U. S.  138,  150-151  (1983)  (explaining  that  the 
government  has  a  legitimate  interest  "in  `promot[ing]  effi-ciency  and  integrity  in  the  discharge  of  official  duties,  and 
[in]  maintain[ing]  proper  discipline  in  the  public  service' " (quoting  Ex  parte  Curtis,  106  U. S.  371,  373  (1882);  alter-
ations  in  original)).  "The  government's  interest  in  achiev-ing  its  goals  as  effectively  and  efficiently  as  possible  is  ele-
vated  from  a  relatively  subordinate  interest  when  it  acts  as sovereign  to  a  significant  one  when  it  acts  as  employer."

Wa ters,  supra,  at  675  (plurality  opinion).  Given  the "common-sense realization that government offices could not 

function  if  every  employment  decision  became  a  constitu-tional  matter," 

Connick,  supra,  at  143,  "constitutional  re-
view of  government  employment  decisions  must  rest on dif-ferent  principles  than  review  of  .  .  .  restraints  imposed  by 

the government as sovereign," Waters, supra, at 674 (plural-
ity opinion). In light of these basic principles, we have often recognized 

that government has significantly greater leeway in its deal-ings  with  citizen  employees  than  it  does  when  it  brings  its 
sovereign  power  to  bear  on  citizens  at  large.  Thus,  for  ex-
ample,  we  have  held  that  the  Fourth  Amendment  does  not

concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in pro-moting  the  efficiency  of  the  public  services  it  performs 

through its employees." We  analyzed  the  contours  of  this  balance  more  fully  in 
Connick  v.  Myers,  supra.  We  explained  that  the  First Amendment  protects  public  employee  speech  only  when  it 
falls within the core of First Amendment protection--speech 
on  matters  of  public  concern.  We  recognized  that  the " `First  Amendment  does  not  protect  speech  and  assembly 

only  to  the  extent  it  can  be  characterized  as  political,' "  and that  the  government  therefore  could  not  generally  prohibit 
or punish, in its capacity as sovereign, speech on the ground 
that it does not touch upon matters of public concern, id., at 
147  (quoting  Mine  Workers  v.  Illinois  Bar  Assn.,  389  U. S. 
217,  223  (1967)).  But  "[w]hen  employee  expression  cannot 
be  fairly  considered  as  relating  to  any  matter  of  political, 
social,  or  other  concern  to  the  community,  government  offi-
cials  should  enjoy  wide  latitude  in  managing  their  offices." 
Connick,  461  U. S.,  at  146.  As  we  explained,  "absent  the 
most unusual circumstances, a federal court is not the appro-
priate  forum  in  which  to  review  the  wisdom  of  a  personnel 
decision  taken  by  a  public  agency  allegedly  in  reaction  to 
the  employee's  behavior."  Id.,  at 147  (citing  Bishop, supra, 
at 349-350). 

Our  precedent  in  the  public  employee  context  therefore 
establishes two main principles: First, although government 
employees  do  not  lose  their  constitutional  rights  when  they 
accept their positions, those rights must be balanced against 
the realities of the employment context.  Second, in striking 
the  appropriate  balance,  we  consider  whether  the  asserted 
employee right implicates the basic concerns  of the relevant 
constitutional  provision,  or  whether  the  claimed  right  can 
more  readily  give  way  to  the  requirements  of  the  govern-
ment  as employer.  With  these  principles  in  mind,  we  come 
to the question whether a class-of-one theory of equal protec-
tion is cognizable in the public employment context.

Our equal protection jurisprudence has typically been con-cerned  with  governmental  classifications  that  "affect  some 

groups  of  citizens  differently  than  others."  McGowan  v. 
Maryland,  366  U. S.  420,  425  (1961).  See,  e. g.,  Ross  v. Moffitt,  417  U. S.  600,  609  (1974)  (" `Equal  protection'  .  .  . 

emphasizes  disparity  in  treatment  by  a  State  between classes of individuals whose situations are arguably indistin-
guishable"); San Antonio Independent School Dist. v.  Rodri-
guez,  411  U. S.  1,  60  (1973)  (Stewart,  J.,  concurring)  ("[T]he basic  concern  of  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  is  with  state 

legislation  whose  purpose  or  effect  is  to  create  discrete  and objectively  identifiable  classes").  Plaintiffs  in  such  cases 
generally allege that they have been arbitrarily classified as members  of  an  "identifiable  group."  Personnel  Adminis-
trator of Mass. v.  Feeney, 442 U. S. 256, 279 (1979). Engquist correctly argues, however, that we recognized in 
Olech  that  an  equal  protection  claim  can  in  some  circum-stances  be  sustained  even  if  the  plaintiff  has  not  alleged 
class-based  discrimination,  but  instead  claims  that  she  has been irrationally singled out as a so-called "class of one."  In 
Olech,  a  property  owner  had  asked  the  village  of  Willow-brook to connect her property to the municipal water supply. 
Although  the  village  had  required  only  a  15-foot  easement from other property owners seeking access to the water sup-
ply,  the  village  conditioned  Olech's  connection  on  a  grant  of a  33-foot  easement.  Olech  sued  the  village,  claiming  that 
the village's requirement of an easement 18 feet longer than the  norm  violated  the  Equal  Protection  Clause.  Although 
Olech  had  not  alleged  that  the  village  had  discriminated against her based on membership in an identifiable class, we 
held that her complaint stated a valid claim under the Equal Protection  Clause  because  it  alleged  that  she  had  "been  in-
tentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treat-
ment."  528  U. S.,  at  564  (citing  Sioux  City  Bridge  Co.  v.

Opinion of the Court 
Dakota  County,  260  U. S.  441  (1923),  and  Allegheny  Pitts-
burgh  Coal  Co.  v.  Commission  of  Webster  Cty.,  488  U. S. 
336 (1989)). Recognition  of  the  class-of-one  theory  of  equal  protection 

on  the  facts  in  Olech  was not  so much  a  departure  from the principle that the Equal Protection Clause is concerned with 
arbitrary  government  classification,  as  it  was  an  application 
of that principle.  That case involved the government's reg-ulation  of  property.  Similarly,  the  cases  upon  which  the 

Court  in  Olech  relied  concerned  property  assessment  and taxation  schemes.  See 

Allegheny Pittsburgh, supra; Sioux 
City  Bridge,  supra.  We  expect  such  legislative  or  regula-
tory classifications  to apply  "without  respect to  persons," to 
borrow  a  phrase  from  the  judicial  oath.  See  28  U. S. C. 

$ 453.  As  we  explained  long  ago,  the  Fourteenth  Amend-
ment  "requires  that  all  persons  subjected  to  .  .  .  legislation 
shall  be  treated  alike,  under  like  circumstances  and  condi-
tions,  both  in  the  privileges  conferred  and  in  the  liabilities 
imposed."  Hayes  v.  Missouri,  120  U. S.  68,  71-72  (1887). 
When  those  who  appear  similarly  situated  are  nevertheless 
treated  differently,  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  requires  at 
least  a  rational  reason  for  the  difference,  to  ensure  that  all 
persons subject to legislation or regulation are indeed being 
"treated  alike,  under  like  circumstances  and  conditions." 
Thus, when it appears that an individual is being singled out 
by  the  government,  the  specter  of  arbitrary  classification  is 
fairly raised, and the Equal Protection Clause requires a "ra-
tional  basis  for  the  difference  in  treatment."  Olech,  528 
U. S., at 564. 

What seems to have been significant in Olech and the cases 
on  which  it  relied  was  the  existence  of  a  clear  standard 
against  which  departures,  even  for  a  single  plaintiff,  could 
be  readily  assessed.  There  was  no  indication  in  Olech  that 
the  zoning  board  was  exercising  discretionary  authority 
based  on  subjective,  individualized  determinations--at  least 
not  with  regard  to  easement  length,  however  typical  such

people that did not get speeding tickets, and a "class of one" 
that  did.  But  assuming  that  it  is  in  the  nature  of  the  par-
ticular  government  activity  that  not  all  speeders  can  be 
stopped and  ticketed, complaining that one has been singled 
out  for  no  reason  does  not  invoke  the  fear  of  improper  gov-
ernment classification.  Such a complaint, rather, challenges 
the  legitimacy  of  the  underlying  action  itself--the  decision 
to  ticket  speeders  under  such  circumstances.  Of  course,  an 
allegation that speeding tickets are given out on the basis of 
race  or  sex  would  state  an  equal  protection  claim,  because 
such discriminatory classifications implicate basic equal pro-
tection  concerns.  But  allowing  an  equal  protection  claim 
on  the  ground  that  a  ticket  was  given  to  one  person  and 
not  others,  even  if  for  no  discernible  or  articulable  reason, 
would  be  incompatible  with  the  discretion  inherent  in  the 
challenged  action.  It  is  no  proper  challenge  to  what  in  its 
nature  is  a  subjective,  individualized  decision  that  it  was 
subjective and individualized. 

This principle applies most clearly in the employment con-
text, for employment decisions are quite often subjective and 
individualized,  resting  on  a  wide  array  of  factors  that  are 
difficult  to  articulate  and  quantify.  As  Engquist  herself 
points  out,  "[u]nlike  the  zoning  official,  the  public  employer 
often must take into account the individual personalities and 
interpersonal  relationships  of  employees  in  the  workplace. 
The  close  relationship  between  the  employer  and  employee, 
and  the  varied  needs  and  interests  involved  in  the  employ-
ment  context,  mean  that  considerations  such  as  concerns 
over  personality  conflicts  that  would  be  unreasonable  as 
grounds  for  `arm's-length'  government  decisions  (e. g.,  zon-
ing, licensing) may well justify different treatment of a public 
employee."  Brief  for  Petitioner  48.  Unlike  the  context  of 
arm's-length regulation, such as in Olech, treating seemingly 
similarly  situated  individuals  differently  in  the  employment 
context is par for the course.

Opinion of the Court 
Thus,  the  class-of-one  theory  of  equal  protection--which 
presupposes that like individuals should be treated alike, and 
that  to  treat  them  differently  is  to  classify  them  in  a  way 
that  must  survive  at  least  rationality  review--is  simply  a 
poor fit in the public employment context.  To treat employ-
ees  differently  is  not  to  classify  them  in  a  way  that  raises 
equal  protection  concerns.  Rather,  it  is  simply  to  exer-
cise  the  broad  discretion  that  typically  characterizes  the 
employer-employee  relationship.  A  challenge  that  one  has 
been  treated  individually  in  this  context,  instead  of  like 
everyone else, is a challenge to the underlying nature of the 
government action. 

Of  course,  that  is  not  to  say  that  the  Equal  Protection 
Clause,  like  other  constitutional  provisions,  does  not  apply 
to  public  employers.  Indeed,  our  cases  make  clear  that 
the  Equal  Protection  Clause is  implicated  when  the  govern-
ment  makes  class-based  decisions  in  the  employment  con-
text,  treating  distinct  groups  of  individuals  categorically 
differently.  See,  e. g.,  Beazer,  440  U. S.,  at  593  (upholding 
city's  exclusion  of  methadone  users  from  employment  under 
rational-basis  review);  Martin,  440  U. S.,  at  199-201  (clas-
sification  between  teachers  who  had  complied  with  a

Opinion of the Court 
This  is  not  surprising,  given  the  historical  understanding of the nature of government employment.  We long ago rec-

ognized the "settled principle that government employment, in the absence of legislation, can be revoked at the will of the 
appointing  officer."  McElroy,  367  U. S.,  at  896.  The  basic principle  of  at-will  employment  is  that  an  employee  may  be 
terminated  for  a  " `good  reason,  bad  reason,  or  no  reason 
at  all.' "  Reply  Brief  for  Petitioner  27.  See  Andrews  v. 
Louisville  &  Nashville  R.  Co.,  406  U. S.  320,  324  (1972) 
("[T]he  very  concept  of  `wrongful  discharge'  implies  some sort  of  statutory  or  contractual  standard  that  modifies  the 

traditional  common-law  rule  that  a  contract  of  employment is  terminable  by  either  party  at  will").  Thus,  "[w]e  have 
never held that it is a violation of the Constitution for a gov-ernment  employer  to  discharge  an  employee  based  on  sub-
stantively  incorrect  information."  Waters,  511  U. S.,  at  679 
(plurality  opinion).  See  also  Connick,  461  U. S.,  at  146-147 ("[O]rdinary dismissals from government service . . . are not 

subject  to  judicial  review  even  if  the  reasons  for  the  dis-missal  are  alleged  to  be  mistaken  or  unreasonable"  (citing 
Board  of  Regents  of  State  Colleges  v.  Roth,  408  U. S.  564 (1972); 

Perry  v.  Sindermann,  408  U. S.  593  (1972);  and 
Bishop,  426  U. S.  341)).  "And  an  at-will  government  em-
ployee  . .  .  generally  has  no  claim  based  on  the  Constitution 
at all."  Waters, supra, at 679 (plurality opinion).  See, e. g., 
Bishop, supra, at 349-350. 

State  employers  cannot,  of  course,  take  personnel  actions 
that  would  independently  violate  the  Constitution.  See 
supra,  at  598-600.  But  recognition  of  a  class-of-one  theory 
of  equal  protection  in  the  public  employment  context--that 
is,  a  claim  that  the  State  treated  an  employee  differently 
from others for a bad reason, or for no reason at all--is sim-
ply  contrary  to  the  concept  of  at-will  employment.  The 
Constitution  does  not  require  repudiating  that  familiar 
doctrine. 

To be sure, Congress and all the States have, for the most 
part,  replaced  at-will  employment  with  various  statutory

Opinion of the Court 
schemes protecting  public  employees from  discharge  for im-
permissible  reasons.  See,  e. g.,  5  U. S. C. $ 2302(b)(10)  (2006 
ed.)  (supervisor  of  covered  federal  employee  may  not  "dis-
criminate  .  .  .  on  the  basis  of  conduct  which  does  not  ad-
versely  affect  the  performance  of  the  employee  or  applicant 
or  the  performance  of  others").  See  also  Brief  for  United 
States  as  Amicus  Curiae  20-21.  But  a  government's  deci-
sion  to  limit  the  ability  of  public  employers  to  fire  at  will  is 
an act of legislative grace, not constitutional mandate. 

Indeed,  recognizing  the  sort  of  claim  Engquist  presses 
could  jeopardize  the  delicate  balance  governments  have 
struck between the rights of public employees and "the gov-
ernment's  legitimate  purpose  in  `promot[ing]  efficiency  and 
integrity  in  the  discharge  of  official  duties,  and  [in]  main-
tain[ing] proper discipline in the public service.' "  Connick, 
supra, at 150-151 (quoting Ex parte Curtis, 106 U. S., at 373; 
alterations  in  original).  Thus,  for  example,  although  most 
federal  employees  are  covered  by  the  Civil  Service  Reform 
Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 1111, Congress has specifically excluded 
some  groups  of  employees  from  its  protection,  see,  e. g.,  5 
U. S. C.  $ 2302(a)(2)(C)  (excluding  from  coverage,  inter  alia, 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence 
Agency, and the Defense Intelligence Agency).  Were we to 
find  that  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  subjects  the  govern-
ment to equal protection review for every allegedly arbitrary 
employment action, we will have undone Congress's (and the 
States') careful work. 

In concluding  that the class-of-one theory of equal protec-
tion  has  no  application  in  the  public  employment  context-- 
and  that  is  all  we  decide--we  are  guided,  as  in  the  past,  by 
the "common-sense realization that government offices could 
not function if every employment decision became a constitu-
tional  matter."  Connick,  supra,  at  143.  If,  as  Engquist 
suggests, plaintiffs need not claim discrimination on the basis 
of membership in some class or group, but rather may argue 
only  that  they  were  treated  by  their  employers  worse  than

Opinion of the Court 
other  employees  similarly  situated,  any  personnel  action  in which  a  wronged  employee  can  conjure  up  a  claim  of  differ-

ential treatment will suddenly become the basis for a federal constitutional  claim.  Indeed,  an  allegation  of  arbitrary  dif-
ferential  treatment  could  be  made  in  nearly  every  instance of  an assertedly  wrongful  employment action--not  only  hir-
ing  and  firing  decisions,  but  any  personnel  action,  such  as 
promotion,  salary,  or  work  assignments--on  the  theory  that other  employees  were  not  treated  wrongfully.  See  478 

F.  3d,  at  995.  On  Engquist's  view,  every  one  of  these  em-ployment decisions by a government employer would become 
the basis for an equal protection complaint. 

Engquist  assures  us  that  accepting  her  view  would  not 
pose too much of a practical problem.  Specifically, Engquist 
argues  that  a  plaintiff  in  a  class-of-one  employment  case 
would have to prove that the government's differential treat-
ment  was  intentional,  that  the  plaintiff  was  treated  differ-
ently from other similarly situated persons, and that the un-
equal  treatment  was  not  rationally  related  to  a  legitimate 
government  purpose.  Brief  for  Petitioner  36-39.  And  be-
cause  a  "governmental  employment  decision  is  .  .  .  rational 
whenever  the  discrimination  relates  to  a  legitimate  govern-
ment interest," it is in practice "difficult for plaintiffs to show 
that the government has failed to meet this standard."  Id., 
at 41.  Justice

composed  of  shatter-resistant  glass  under  patent  A,  the blanks  would  nonetheless  have  substantially  embodied,  and 

therefore  exhausted,  patent  B  for  the  finished  lenses.  This case  is  no  different.  While  each  Intel  microprocessor  and 
chipset  practices  thousands  of  individual  patents,  including some  LGE  patents  not  at  issue  in  this  case,  the  exhaustion 
analysis is not altered by the fact that more than one patent is  practiced  by  the  same  product.  The  relevant  consider-
ation  is  whether  the  Intel  Products  that  partially  practice  a patent--by,  for  example,  embodying  its  essential  features-- 
exhaust that

was not  conditioned  on the  notice  or on Quanta's  decision  to abide by LGE's directions in that notice. 

LGE  points  out  that  the  License  Agreement  specifically disclaimed any license to third parties to practice the patents 
by  combining  licensed  products  with  other  components. Brief for Petitioners 8.  But the question whether third par-
ties  received  implied  licenses  is  irrelevant  because  Quanta 
asserts  its  right  to  practice  the  patents  based  not  on  im-plied license but on exhaustion.  And exhaustion turns only 

on  Intel's  own  license  to  sell  products  practicing  the  LGE Patents. 

Alternatively,  LGE  invokes  the  principle  that  patent  ex-haustion does not apply to postsale restrictions on "making" 
an  article.  Brief  for  Respondent  43.  But  this  is  simply  a rephrasing of its argument that combining the Intel Products 
with other components adds more than standard finishing to complete  a  patented  article.  As  explained  above,  making  a 
product  that  substantially  embodies  a  patent  is,  for  exhaus-
tion purposes, no different from making the patented article 
itself.  In other words, no further "making" results from the 
addition of standard parts--here, the buses and memory--to 
a product that already substantially embodies the patent. 

The  License  Agreement  authorized  Intel  to  sell  products 
that  practiced  the  LGE  Patents.  No  conditions  limited  In-
tel's  authority  to  sell  products  substantially  embodying  the 
patents.  Because  Intel  was  authorized  to  sell  its  products 
to  Quanta,  the  doctrine  of  patent  exhaustion  prevents  LGE 
from  further  asserting  its  patent  rights  with  respect  to  the 
patents substantially embodied by those products.7 

7 We  note  that  the  authorized  nature  of  the  sale  to  Quanta  does  not 
necessarily limit LGE's other contract rights.  LGE's complaint does not 
include a breach-of-contract claim, and we express no opinion on whether 
contract  damages  might be  available  even though exhaustion  operates to 
eliminate patent damages.  See Keeler

of 0% creates a problem: Who wins when the bidding results in  a  tie?  The  county's  solution  is  to  allocate  parcels  "on  a 

rotational  basis"  in  order  to  ensure  that  liens  are  appor-tioned fairly among 0% bidders.  App. 18. 

But  this  creates  a  perverse  incentive  of  its  own:  Bidders who, in addition to bidding themselves, send agents to bid on 
their behalf will obtain a disproportionate share of liens.  To prevent  this  kind  of  manipulation,  the  county  adopted  the 
"Single,  Simultaneous  Bidder  Rule,"  which  requires  each "tax buying entity" to submit bids in its own name and pro-
hibits  it  from  using  "apparent  agents,  employees,  or  related entities"  to  submit  simultaneous  bids  for  the  same  parcel.

Opinion of the Court 

II 
We  begin  by  setting  forth  the  applicable  statutory  provi-sions.  RICO's  private  right  of  action  is  contained  in  18 

U. S. C. $ 1964(c), which provides in relevant part that "[a]ny person  injured  in  his  business  or  property  by  reason  of  a 
violation  of  section  1962  of  this  chapter  may  sue  therefor  in any  appropriate  United  States  district  court  and  shall  re-
cover  threefold  the  damages  he  sustains  and  the  cost  of  the suit,  including  a  reasonable  attorney's  fee."  Section  1962 
contains  RICO's  criminal  prohibitions.  Pertinent  here  is $ 1962(c), which makes it "unlawful  for any person employed 
by or associated with" an enterprise engaged in or affecting interstate  or  foreign  commerce  "to  conduct  or  participate, 
directly  or  indirectly,  in  the  conduct  of  such  enterprise's affairs  through  a  pattern  of  racketeering  activity."  The 
term  "racketeering  activity"  is  defined  to  include  a  host of  so-called  predicate  acts,  including  "any  act  which  is  in-
dictable  under . . .  section  1341  (relating  to  mail  fraud)." $ 1961(1)(B). 

The upshot is that RICO provides a private right of action for  treble  damages  to  any  person  injured  in  his  business  or 
property by reason of the conduct of a qualifying enterprise's affairs  through  a  pattern  of  acts  indictable  as  mail  fraud. 
Mail  fraud,  in  turn,  occurs  whenever  a  person,  "having  de-vised  or  intending  to  devise  any  scheme  or  artifice  to  de-
fraud,"  uses  the  mail  "for  the  purpose  of  executing  such scheme  or  artifice  or  attempting  so  to  do."  $ 1341.  The 
gravamen  of  the  offense  is  the  scheme  to  defraud,  and  any "mailing  that  is  incident  to  an  essential  part  of  the  scheme 
satisfies the mailing element," Schmuck

tern  of  such  acts  without  anyone  relying  on  a  fraudulent misrepresentation. 

It  thus  seems  plain--and  indeed  petitioners  do  not  dis-pute--that  no  showing  of  reliance  is  required  to  establish 
that a person has violated $ 1962(c) by conducting the affairs 
of  an  enterprise  through  a  pattern  of  racketeering  activity consisting of acts of mail fraud.  See

tiff  from  establishing  proximate  cause.  Thus,  for  example, if  the  county  knew  petitioners'  attestations  were  false  but 

nonetheless  permitted  them  to  participate  in  the  auction, then arguably the county's actions would constitute an inter-
vening  cause  breaking  the  chain  of  causation  between  peti-tioners' misrepresentations and respondents' injury. 

Accordingly, it  may  well  be that a  RICO plaintiff  alleging injury by reason of a pattern of mail fraud must establish at 
least third-party reliance in order to prove causation.  "But the  fact  that  proof  of  reliance  is  often  used  to  prove  an  ele-
ment of the plaintiff 's cause of action, such as the element of causation,  does not  transform  reliance  itself into  an  element 
of  the  cause  of  action."  Anza,

IV 
For  the  foregoing  reasons,  we  hold  that  a  plaintiff  assert-ing  a  RICO  claim  predicated  on  mail  fraud  need  not  show, 

either as an element of its claim or as a prerequisite to estab-lishing proximate causation, that it relied on the defendant's 
alleged  misrepresentations.  Accordingly,  the  judgment  of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

fraudulent claim.  Instead, such a plaintiff must prove that the defend-
ant  intended  that  the  false  statement  be  material  to the  Government's 
decision to pay or approve the false claim.  Pp. 668-672. 

(a)  The  Sixth  Circuit's  interpretation  of  $ 3729(a)(2)  impermissibly 
deviates  from  the  statute's  language,  which  requires  the  defendant  to 
make  a  false  statement  "to  get"  a  false  or  fraudulent  claim  "paid  or 
approved  by  the  Government."  Because  "to  get"  denotes  purpose,  a 
person  must  have  the  purpose  of  getting  a  false  or  fraudulent  claim 
"paid or approved by the Government" in order to be liable.  Moreover, 
getting  such  a  claim  "paid  .  .  .  by  the  Government"  is  not  the  same  as 
getting it paid using "government funds."  Under $ 3729(a)(2), a defend-
ant must intend that the Government itself pay the claim.  Eliminating 
this element of intent would expand the FCA well beyond its intended 
role  of  combating  "fraud  against  the  Government."  Rainwater

claimed  that  the  gearboxes  installed  by  Allison  Engine  in the first 52 Gen-Sets were defective and leaked oil; that GTC 

never  conducted  a  required  final  quality  inspection  for  ap-proximately  half  of  the  first  67  Gen-Sets;  and  that  the 
SOFCO  welders  who  worked  on  the  first  67  Gen-Sets  did not meet military standards.  Respondents also claimed that 
petitioners  issued  COCs  claiming  falsely  that  the  Gen-Sets 
had  been  built  to  the  contractually  required  specifications even  though  petitioners  knew  that  those  specifications  had 

not been met. The case was tried to a jury.  At trial, respondents intro-
duced evidence that petitioners had issued COCs that falsely 
stated that their work was completed in compliance with the 
Navy's  requirements  and  that  they  had  presented  invoices 
for  payment  to  the  shipyards.  Respondents  did  not,  how-
ever,  introduce  the  invoices  submitted  by  the  shipyards  to 
the  Navy.  At  the  close  of  respondents'  case,  petitioners 
moved for  judgment as  a  matter of law  pursuant  to Federal 
Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  50(a).  Petitioners  asserted  that 
no  reasonable  jury  could  find  a  violation  under  $ 3729  be-
cause  respondents  had  failed  to  adduce  any  evidence  that  a 
false  or  fraudulent  claim  had  ever  been  presented  to  the 
Navy.  The  District  Court  granted  petitioners'  motion. 
No. 1-:95-cv-970, 2005  WL 713569 (SD Ohio, Mar. 11, 2005). 
The court rejected  respondents' argument  that  they did  not 
have to present evidence that a claim had been submitted to 
the  Navy  because  they  showed  that  Government  funds  had 
been  used  to  pay  the  invoices  that  were  presented  to  the 
shipyards.  The District Court concluded that,  absent proof 
that  false  claims  were  presented  to  the  Government,  re-
spondents'  evidence  was  legally  insufficient  under  the  FCA.

This  does  not  mean,  however,  as  petitioners  suggest,  see 
Reply Brief 1, that $ 3729(a)(2)  requires proof that a defend-ant's false record or statement was submitted to the Govern-

ment.  While  $ 3729(a)(1)  requires  a  plaintiff  to  prove  that the defendant "present[ed]" a false or fraudulent claim to the 
Government, the concept of presentment is not mentioned in $ 3729(a)(2).  The  inclusion  of  an  express  presentment  re-
quirement in subsection (a)(1), combined with the absence of anything similar in subsection (a)(2), suggests that Congress 
did not intend to include a presentment requirement in sub-

Mohammad  Munaf  (hereinafter  petitioners).  The  unit  is under  the  command  of  United  States  military  officers  who 

report to General David Petraeus. 

A 
Petitioner  Shawqi  Omar,  an  American-Jordanian  citizen, voluntarily traveled to Iraq in 2002.  In October 2004, Omar 

was  captured  and  detained  in  Iraq  by  U. S.  military  forces operating as part of the MNF-I during a raid of his Baghdad 
home.  Omar is believed to have provided aid to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi--the late leader of al Qaeda in Iraq--by facilitat-
ing his group's connection with other terrorist groups, bring-ing  foreign  fighters  into  Iraq,  and  planning  and  executing 
kidnapings  in  Iraq.  The  MNF-I  searched  his  home  in  an effort to capture and detain insurgents who were associated 
with  al-Zarqawi.  The  raid  netted  an  Iraqi  insurgent  and four  Jordanian  fighters  along  with  explosive  devices  and 
other weapons. The  captured  insurgents  gave  sworn  statements implicat-
ing  Omar  in  insurgent  cell  activities.  The  four  Jordanians testified that they had traveled to Iraq with Omar to commit 
militant  acts  against  American  and  other  Coalition  forces. Each  of  the  insurgents  stated  that,  while  living  in  Omar's 
home,  they  had  surveilled  potential  kidnap  victims  and  con-ducted  weapons  training.  The  insurgents  explained  that 
Omar's  fluency  in  English  allowed  him  to  lure  foreigners  to his home in order to kidnap and sell them for ransom. 

Following Omar's arrest, a three-member MNF-I Tribunal composed of American military officers concluded that Omar 
posed  a  threat  to  the  security  of Iraq  and  designated  him  a "security internee."  The tribunal also found that Omar had 
committed  hostile  and  warlike  acts,  and  that  he  was  an enemy  combatant  in  the  war  on  terrorism.  In  accordance 
with Article 5  of the  Geneva Convention,  Omar was permit-ted  to  hear  the  basis  for  his  detention,  make  a  statement, 
and call immediately available witnesses.

the United States was free to transfer him to Cuban custody 
for prosecution. 

In  the  present  cases,  the  habeas  petitioners  concede  that 
Iraq  has  the  sovereign  authority  to  prosecute  them  for  al-
leged violations of its law, yet nonetheless request an injunc-
tion prohibiting the United States from transferring them to 
Iraqi  custody.  But  as  the  foregoing  cases  make  clear,  ha-
beas is not a means of compelling the United States to harbor 
fugitives  from  the  criminal  justice  system  of  a  sovereign 
with undoubted authority to prosecute them. 

Petitioners'  "release"  claim  adds  nothing  to  their  "trans-
fer"  claim.  That claim fails  for the  same reasons the  trans-
fer  claim  fails,  given  that  the  release  petitioners  seek  is  re-
lease  in  a  form  that  would  avoid  transfer.  See  Tr.  of  Oral 
Arg. 47-48; App. 40 (coupling Munaf 's claim for release with 
a request for order requiring the United States to bring him 
to  a  U.  S.  court);  App.  123  (same  with  respect  to  Omar). 
Such  "release"  would  impermissibly  interfere  with  Iraq's

Syllabus 
cases (like petitioners') pending when the DTA was enacted.  Congress 
responded  with  the  Military  Commissions  Act  of  2006  (MCA),  $ 7(a)  of 
which amended  $ 2241(e)(1)  to  deny  jurisdiction with respect  to  habeas 
actions  by  detained  aliens  determined  to  be  enemy  combatants,  while 

$ 2241(e)(2) denies jurisdiction as to "any other action against the United 
States  . .  .  relating  to  any  aspect  of  the  detention,  transfer,  treatment, 
trial, or conditions of confinement" of a detained alien determined to be 
an  enemy  combatant.  MCA  $ 7(b)  provides  that  the  $ 2241(e)  amend-
ments  "shall  take  effect  on  the  date  of  the  enactment  of  this  Act,  and 
shall  apply  to  all  cases,  without  exception,  pending  on  or  after  [that] 
date . . . which relate to any aspect of the detention, transfer, treatment, 
trial, or conditions of detention of an alien detained . . . since September 
11, 2001." 

The D. C. Circuit concluded that MCA $ 7 must be read to strip from 
it, and all federal courts, jurisdiction to consider petitioners' habeas ap-
plications; that petitioners are not entitled to habeas or the protections 
of  the Suspension Clause, U. S.  Const., Art. I, $ 9, cl.  2, which provides 
that  "[t]he  Privilege  of  the  Writ  of  Habeas  Corpus  shall  not  be  sus-
pended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety 
may  require  it";  and  that  it  was  therefore  unnecessary  to  consider 
whether  the  DTA  provided  an  adequate  and  effective  substitute  for 
habeas. 

Held: 

1.  MCA  $ 7  denies  the  federal  courts  jurisdiction  to  hear  habeas  ac-
tions, like the instant cases, that were pending at the time of its enact-
ment.  Section 7(b)'s effective date provision undoubtedly applies to ha-
beas  actions, which,  by definition,  "relate to .  . . detention" within that 
section's  meaning.  Petitioners  argue  to  no  avail  that  $ 7(b)  does  not 
apply to a $ 2241(e)(1) habeas action, but only to "any other action" under 

$ 2241(e)(2),  because  it  largely  repeats  that  section's  language.  The 
phrase "other action" in $ 2241(e)(2) cannot be understood without refer-
ring  back  to  $ 2241(e)(1),  which  explicitly  mentions  the  "writ  of  habeas 
corpus."  Because the two paragraphs' structure implies that habeas is 
a  type  of  action  "relating  to  any  aspect  of . . .  detention,"  etc.,  pend-
ing  habeas  actions  are  in  the  category  of  cases  subject  to  the  statute's 
jurisdictional  bar.  This  is  confirmed  by  the  MCA's  legislative  his-
tory.  Thus,  if  MCA  $ 7  is  valid,  petitioners'  cases  must  be  dismissed. 
Pp. 736-739. 

2.  Petitioners  have  the  constitutional  privilege  of  habeas  corpus. 
They  are not barred from seeking the writ or invoking the  Suspension 
Clause's protections because they have been designated as enemy com-
batants or because of their presence at Guantanamo.  Pp. 739-771.

Syllabus 
(a)  A brief account of the writ's history and origins shows that pro-
tection for the habeas privilege was one of the few safeguards of liberty 
specified  in  a  Constitution  that,  at  the  outset,  had  no Bill  of  Rights;  in 
the system  the  Framers conceived, the writ has  a  centrality  that must 
inform proper interpretation of the Suspension Clause.  That the Fram-
ers considered the writ a vital instrument for the protection of individ-
ual  liberty  is  evident  from  the  care  taken  in  the  Suspension  Clause  to 
specify  the  limited  grounds  for  its  suspension:  The  writ  may  be  sus-
pended only when public safety requires it in times of rebellion or inva-
sion.  The  Clause  is  designed  to  protect  against  cyclical  abuses  of  the 
writ by  the Executive  and Legislative Branches.  It  protects  detainee 
rights  by  a  means  consistent  with  the  Constitution's  essential  design, 
ensuring that, except during periods of formal suspension, the Judiciary 
will  have  a  time-tested  device,  the  writ,  to  maintain  the  "delicate  bal-
ance  of  governance."  Hamdi,  supra,  at  536.  Separation-of-powers 
principles,  and  the  history  that  influenced  their  design,  inform  the 
Clause's reach and purpose.  Pp. 739-746. 

(b)  A diligent search of founding-era precedents and legal commen-
taries reveals no certain conclusions.  None of the cases the parties cite 
reveal  whether  a  common-law court  would have  granted,  or  refused to 
hear for lack of jurisdiction, a habeas petition by a prisoner deemed an 
enemy  combatant,  under  a  standard  like  the  Defense  Department's  in 
these cases, and when held in a territory, like Guantanamo, over which 
the  Government  has  total  military  and  civil  control.  The  evidence  as 
to the writ's geographic scope at common law is informative, but, again, 
not  dispositive.  Petitioners  argue  that  the  site  of  their  detention  is 
analogous to two territories outside England to which the common-law 
writ ran, the exempt jurisdictions and India, but critical differences be-
tween  these  places and  Guantanamo  render these  claims unpersuasive. 
The Government argues that Guantanamo is  more closely analogous to 
Scotland  and  Hanover,  where  the  writ  did  not  run,  but  it  is  unclear 
whether  the  common-law  courts  lacked  the  power  to  issue  the  writ 
there,  or  whether  they  refrained  from  doing  so  for  prudential  reasons. 
The parties'  arguments that the  very lack of  a precedent on  point sup-
ports their respective positions are premised upon the doubtful assump-
tions that the historical record is complete and that the common law, if 
properly  understood,  yields  a  definite  answer  to  the  questions  before 
the Court.  Pp. 746-752. 

(c)  The  Suspension  Clause  has  full  effect  at  Guantanamo.  The 
Government's  argument  that  the  Clause  affords  petitioners  no  rights 
because  the  United  States  does  not  claim  sovereignty  over  the  naval 
station is rejected.  Pp. 753-771.

726  BOUMEDIENE  v.  BUSH 

Syllabus 
(1)  The  Court  does  not  question  the  Government's  position  that 
Cuba maintains sovereignty, in the legal and technical sense, over Guan-
tanamo,  but  it  does  not  accept  the  Government's  premise  that  de  jure 
sovereignty  is the touchstone of habeas jurisdiction.  Common-law ha-
beas'  history  provides  scant  support  for  this  proposition,  and  it  is 
inconsistent  with  the  Court's  precedents  and  contrary  to  fundamental 
separation-of-powers principles.  Pp. 753-755. 

(2)  Discussions  of  the  Constitution's  extraterritorial  application 
in  cases  involving  provisions  other  than  the  Suspension  Clause  under-
mine  the  Government's  argument.  Fundamental  questions  regarding 
the Constitution's geographic scope first arose when the Nation acquired 
Hawaii  and  the  noncontiguous  Territories  ceded  by  Spain  after  the 
Spanish-American War, and Congress discontinued its prior practice of 
extending  constitutional  rights  to  territories  by  statute.  In  the  so-
called Insular Cases, the Court held that the Constitution had independ-
ent force in the Territories that was not contingent upon acts of legisla-
tive grace.  See, e. g., Dorr v. United States, 195 U. S. 138.  Yet because 
of  the  difficulties  and  disruption  inherent  in  transforming  the  former 
Spanish  colonies'  civil-law  system  into  an  Anglo-American  system,  the 
Court adopted the doctrine of territorial incorporation, under which the 
Constitution  applies  in  full  in  incorporated  Territories  surely  destined 
for statehood but only in part in unincorporated Territories.  See, e. g., 
id.,  at  143.  Practical  considerations  likewise  influenced  the  Court's 
analysis in Reid v.  Covert, 354 U. S. 1, where, in applying the jury provi-
sions  of  the  Fifth  and  Sixth  Amendments  to  American  civilians  being 
tried  by  the  U.  S.  military  abroad,  both  the  plurality  and  the  concur-
rences noted the relevance of practical considerations, related not to the 
petitioners'  citizenship,  but  to  the  place  of  their  confinement  and  trial. 
Finally,  in  holding  that  habeas  jurisdiction  did  not  extend  to  enemy 
aliens,  convicted  of  violating  the  laws  of  war,  who  were  detained  in  a 
German prison during the Allied Powers' post-World War II occupation, 
the Court, in Johnson v.  Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763, stressed the practi-
cal  difficulties  of  ordering  the  production  of  the  prisoners,  id.,  at  779. 
The Government's reading of Eisentrager as adopting a formalistic test 
for  determining  the  Suspension  Clause's  reach  is  rejected  because: 
(1)  The  discussion  of  practical  considerations  in  that  case  was  integral 
to a part of the Court's opinion that came before it announced its hold-
ing, see id., at 781; (2) it mentioned the concept of territorial sovereignty 
only twice in its opinion, in contrast to its significant discussion of practi-
cal barriers to the running of the writ; and (3) if the Government's read-
ing  were  correct,  the  opinion  would  have  marked  not  only  a  change 
in,  but  a  complete  repudiation  of,  the  Insular  Cases'  (and  later  Reid's) 
functional  approach.  A  constricted  reading  of  Eisentrager  overlooks

Syllabus 
what the Court sees as a common thread uniting all these cases: the idea 
that extraterritoriality questions turn on objective factors and practical 
concerns, not formalism.  Pp. 755-764. 

(3)  The  Government's  sovereignty-based  test  raises  troubling 
separation-of-powers  concerns,  which  are  illustrated  by  Guantanamo's 
political history.  Although the United States has maintained complete 
and  uninterrupted  control  of  Guantanamo  for  over  100  years,  the  Gov-
ernment's  view  is  that  the  Constitution  has  no  effect  there,  at  least  as 
to noncitizens, because the United States disclaimed formal sovereignty 
in its 1903 lease with Cuba.  The Nation's basic charter cannot be con-
tracted away like this.  The Constitution grants Congress and the Pres-
ident  the  power  to  acquire,  dispose  of,  and  govern  territory,  not  the 
power  to  decide  when  and  where  its  terms  apply.  To  hold  that  the 
political  branches  may  switch  the  Constitution  on  or  off  at  will  would 
lead  to  a  regime  in  which  they,  not  this  Court,  say  "what  the  law  is." 
Marbury v.  Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177.  These concerns have particu-
lar  bearing  upon  the  Suspension  Clause  question  here,  for  the  habeas 
writ is itself an indispensable mechanism for monitoring the separation 
of powers.  Pp. 764-766. 

(4)  Based on Eisentrager, supra, at 777, and the Court's reason-
ing  in  its  other  extraterritoriality  opinions,  at  least  three  factors  are 
relevant in determining the Suspension Clause's reach: (1) the detainees' 
citizenship  and  status  and  the  adequacy  of  the  process  through  which 
that status was determined; (2) the nature of the sites where apprehen-
sion and then detention took place; and (3) the practical obstacles inher-
ent  in  resolving  the  prisoner's  entitlement  to the  writ.  Application  of 
this framework reveals, first, that petitioners' status is in dispute: They 
are  not  American  citizens,  but  deny  they  are  enemy  combatants;  and 
although  they  have  been  afforded  some  process  in  CSRT  proceedings, 
there  has  been  no  Eisentrager-style  trial  by  military  commission  for 
violations  of  the  laws  of  war.  Second,  while  the  sites  of  petitioners' 
apprehension and detention weigh against finding they have Suspension 
Clause rights, there are critical differences between Eisentrager's Ger-
man  prison,  circa  1950,  and  the  Guantanamo  Naval  Station  in  2008, 
given  the  Government's  absolute  and  indefinite  control  over  the  naval 
station.  Third, although the Court is sensitive to the financial and ad-
ministrative costs of holding the Suspension Clause applicable in a case 
of  military  detention  abroad,  these  factors  are  not  dispositive  because 
the Government  presents no credible arguments that the military mis-
sion at Guantanamo would be compromised if habeas courts had jurisdic-
tion.  The situation in Eisentrager was far different, given the histori-
cal  context  and  nature  of  the  military's  mission  in  post-War  Germany.

(d)  Petitioners are therefore entitled to the habeas privilege, and if 
that  privilege  is  to  be  denied  them,  Congress  must  act  in  accordance 
with  the  Suspension  Clause's  requirements.  Cf.  Hamdi,  542  U. S.,  at 
564.  P. 771. 

3.  Because the DTA's  procedures for reviewing detainees' status are 
not  an  adequate  and  effective  substitute  for  the  habeas  writ,  MCA  $ 7 
operates as an unconstitutional suspension of the writ.  Pp. 771-792. 

(a)  Given  its holding that the writ does  not run to  petitioners, the 
D.  C.  Circuit  found  it  unnecessary  to  consider  whether  there  was  an 
adequate substitute for habeas.  This Court usually remands for consid-
eration  of  questions  not  decided  below,  but  departure  from  this  rule 
is  appropriate  in  "exceptional"  circumstances,  see,  e. g.,  Cooper  Indus-
tries,  Inc.  v.  Aviall  Services,  Inc.,  543  U. S.  157,  169,  here,  the  grave 
separation-of-powers issues raised by these cases and the fact that peti-
tioners  have  been  denied  meaningful  access  to  a  judicial  forum  for 
years.  Pp. 771-773. 

(b)  Historically,  Congress  has  taken  care  to  avoid  suspensions  of 
the writ.  For example, the statutes at issue in the Court's two leading 
cases  addressing  habeas  substitutes,  Swain  v.  Pressley,  430  U. S.  372, 
and United States v.  Hayman, 342  U. S. 205,  were attempts to stream-
line habeas relief, not to cut it back.  Those cases provide little guidance 
here because, inter alia, the statutes in question gave the courts broad 
remedial  powers  to  secure  the  historic  office  of  the  writ,  and  included 
saving  clauses  to  preserve  habeas  review  as  an  avenue  of  last  resort. 
In contrast,  Congress  intended  the DTA  and the  MCA  to  circumscribe 
habeas  review,  as  is  evident  from  the  unequivocal  nature  of  MCA  $ 7's 
jurisdiction-stripping language, from the DTA's text limiting the Court 
of  Appeals'  jurisdiction  to  assessing  whether  the  CSRT  complied  with 
the  "standards  and  procedures  specified  by  the  Secretary  of  Defense," 
DTA  $ 1005(e)(2)(C),  and  from  the  absence  of  a  saving  clause  in  either 
Act.  That Congress intended to create a more limited procedure is also 
confirmed  by  the  legislative  history  and  by  a  comparison  of  the  DTA 
and  the  habeas  statute  that  would  govern  in  MCA  $ 7's  absence,  28 
U. S. C. $ 2241.  In $ 2241, Congress authorized "any justice" or "circuit 
judge" to issue the writ, thereby accommodating the necessity for fact-
finding that will arise in some cases by allowing the appellate judge or 
Justice  to  transfer  the  case  to  a  district  court.  See  $ 2241(b).  How-
ever, by granting the D. C. Circuit "exclusive" jurisdiction over petition-
ers' cases, see DTA $ 1005(e)(2)(A), Congress has foreclosed that option 
in these cases.  Pp. 773-779. 

(c)  This  Court  does  not  endeavor  to  offer  a  comprehensive  sum-
mary  of the  requisites for  an adequate habeas substitute.  It  is uncon-
troversial, however, that the habeas privilege entitles the prisoner to a

meaningful  opportunity  to  demonstrate  that  he  is  being  held  pursuant 
to "the erroneous application or interpretation" of relevant law, INS v. 
St.  Cyr,  533  U. S.  289,  302,  and  the  habeas  court  must  have  the  power 
to  order  the  conditional  release  of  an  individual  unlawfully  detained. 
But  more  may  be  required  depending  on  the  circumstances.  Petition-
ers identify what they see as myriad deficiencies in the CSRTs, the most 
relevant  being  the  constraints  upon  the  detainee's  ability  to  rebut  the 
factual basis for the Government's assertion that he is an enemy combat-
ant.  At the CSRT stage the detainee has limited means to find or pre-
sent  evidence  to  challenge  the  Government's  case,  does  not  have  the 
assistance of counsel, and may not be aware of the most critical allega-
tions that the Government relied upon to order his detention.  His op-
portunity to confront witnesses is likely to be more theoretical than real, 
given that there are no limits on the admission of hearsay.  The Court 
therefore agrees with petitioners that there is considerable risk of error 
in  the  tribunal's  findings  of  fact.  And  given  that  the  consequence  of 
error  may  be  detention  for  the  duration  of  hostilities  that  may  last  a 
generation  or  more,  the  risk  is  too  significant  to  ignore.  Accordingly, 
for  the  habeas  writ,  or  its  substitute,  to  function  as  an  effective  and 
meaningful  remedy  in  this  context,  the  court  conducting  the  collateral 
proceeding  must have  some  ability  to correct  any  errors, to  assess  the 
sufficiency of the Government's evidence, and to admit and consider rele-
vant  exculpatory  evidence  that  was  not  introduced  during  the  earlier 
proceeding.  In  re  Yamashita,  327  U. S.  1,  5,  8,  and  Ex  parte  Quirin, 
317 U. S. 1, 23-25, distinguished.  Pp. 779-787. 

(d)  Petitioners have met their burden of establishing that the DTA 
review  process  is,  on  its  face,  an  inadequate  substitute  for  habeas. 
Among  the  constitutional  infirmities  from  which  the  DTA  potentially 
suffers  are  the  absence  of  provisions  allowing  petitioners  to  challenge 
the President's  authority under  the  AUMF  to detain  them indefinitely, 
to contest the CSRT's  findings of fact, to supplement  the record on  re-
view with exculpatory evidence discovered after the CSRT proceedings, 
and  to  request  release.  The  statute  cannot  be  read  to  contain  each  of 
these  constitutionally  required  procedures.  MCA  $ 7  thus  effects  an 
unconstitutional  suspension  of  the writ.  There  is  no  jurisdictional  bar 
to  the  District  Court's  entertaining  petitioners'  claims.  Pp.  787-792. 

4.  Nor are there prudential barriers to habeas review.  Pp. 793-796. 

(a)  Petitioners need not seek review of their CSRT determinations 
in  the  D.  C.  Circuit  before  proceeding  with  their  habeas  actions  in  the 
District Court.  If these cases involved detainees held for only a short 
time  while  awaiting  their  CSRT  determinations,  or  were  it  probable 
that the Court of Appeals could complete a prompt review of their appli-

cations,  the  case  for  requiring  temporary  abstention  or  exhaustion  of 
alternative remedies would be much stronger.  But these qualifications 
no longer pertain here.  In some instances six years have elapsed with-
out the judicial oversight that habeas corpus or an adequate substitute 
demands.  To require these detainees to pursue the limited structure of 
DTA review before proceeding with habeas actions would be to require 
additional  months,  if  not  years,  of  delay.  This  holding  should  not  be 
read  to  imply  that  a  habeas  court  should  intervene  the  moment  an 
enemy combatant steps foot in a territory where the writ runs.  Except 
in cases of undue delay, such as the present, federal courts should refrain 
from  entertaining  an  enemy  combatant's  habeas  petition  at  least  until 
after the CSRT has had a chance to review his status.  Pp. 793-795. 

(b)  In  effectuating  today's  holding,  certain  accommodations--in-
cluding  channeling future  cases  to  a  single district  court and requiring 
that  court  to  use  its  discretion  to  accommodate  to  the  greatest  extent 
possible the Government's legitimate interest in protecting sources and 
intelligence  gathering  methods--should  be  made  to  reduce  the  burden 
habeas  proceedings  will  place  on  the  military,  without  impermissibly 
diluting the writ's protections.  Pp. 795-796. 

5.  In considering both the procedural and substantive standards used 
to impose detention to prevent acts of terrorism, the courts must accord 
proper deference to the political branches.  However, security subsists, 
too, in fidelity to freedom's first principles, chief among them being free-
dom from arbitrary and unlawful restraint and the personal liberty that 
is secured by adherence to the separation of powers.  Pp. 796-798.

ents 10. Interpreting  the  AUMF,  the  Department  of  Defense  or-

dered  the  detention  of  these  petitioners,  and  they  were 
transferred to Guantanamo.  Some of these individuals were apprehended  on  the  battlefield  in  Afghanistan,  others  in 

places  as  far  away  from  there  as  Bosnia  and  Gambia.  All are foreign nationals, but none is a citizen of a nation now at 
war with the United States.  Each denies he is a member of 
the al Qaeda terrorist network that carried out the Septem-
ber  11  attacks  or  of  the  Taliban  regime  that  provided  sanc-
tuary  for  al  Qaeda.  Each  petitioner  appeared  before  a 
separate CSRT; was determined to be an enemy combatant; 
and has sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States 
District Court for the District of Columbia. 

The  first  actions  commenced in  February  2002.  The  Dis-
trict  Court  ordered  the  cases  dismissed  for  lack  of  jurisdic-
tion because the naval station is outside the sovereign terri-
tory of the  United States.  See Rasul  v.  Bush, 215  F. Supp. 
2d  55  (2002).  The  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  District  of  Co-
lumbia Circuit affirmed.  See Al Odah  v.  United  States, 321 
F. 3d 1134, 1145 (2003).  We granted certiorari and reversed, 
holding that 28 U. S. C. $ 2241 extended statutory habeas cor-
pus  jurisdiction  to  Guantanamo.  See  Rasul  v.  Bush,  542 
U. S.  466,  473  (2004).  The  constitutional  issue  presented  in 
the instant cases was not reached in Rasul.  Id., at 476. 

After  Rasul,  petitioners'  cases  were  consolidated  and  en-
tertained  in  two  separate  proceedings.  In  the  first  set  of 
cases, Judge Richard J. Leon granted  the Government's mo-
tion to dismiss, holding that the detainees had no rights that 
could be vindicated in a habeas corpus action.  In the second 
set  of  cases  Judge  Joyce  Hens  Green  reached  the  opposite 
conclusion,  holding  the  detainees  had  rights  under  the  Due

Detainee Cases, 355 F. Supp. 2d 443, 464 (DC 2005). While appeals were pending from the District Court deci-

sions, Congress passed the DTA.  Subsection (e) of $ 1005 of the  DTA  amended  28  U. S. C.  $ 2241  to  provide  that  "no 
court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or con-
sider  .  .  .  an  application  for  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus  filed  by or  on  behalf  of  an  alien  detained  by  the  Department  of  De-

fense  at  Guantanamo  Bay,  Cuba."  119  Stat.  2742.  Section 1005 further provides that the Court of Appeals for the Dis-
trict  of  Columbia  Circuit  shall  have  "exclusive"  jurisdiction 
to review decisions of the CSRTs.  Ibid. 

In Hamdan v.  Rumsfeld, 548 U. S. 557, 576-577 (2006), the 
Court held this provision did not apply to cases (like petition-
ers')  pending  when  the  DTA  was  enacted.  Congress  re-
sponded by passing the MCA, 10 U. S. C. $ 948a et seq., which

ment  is  discussed  below.  See  Part  II,  infra.  (Four  Mem-

II 
As  a  threshold  matter,  we  must  decide  whether  MCA  $ 7 
denies  the  federal  courts  jurisdiction  to  hear  habeas  corpus actions  pending  at  the  time  of  its  enactment.  We  hold  the 

statute  does  deny  that  jurisdiction,  so  that,  if  the  statute  is 
valid, petitioners' cases must be dismissed. As amended by the terms of the MCA, 28 U. S. C. $ 2241(e) 

now provides: 

"(1)  No court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to  hear  or  consider  an  application  for  a  writ  of  habeas 

corpus  filed  by  or  on  behalf  of  an  alien  detained  by  the 
United  States  who  has  been  determined  by  the  United States to have been properly detained as an enemy com-

batant or is awaiting such determination. "(2)  Except  as  provided  in  [$$ 1005(e)(2)  and  (e)(3)  of 
the  DTA]  no  court,  justice,  or  judge  shall  have  jurisdic-
tion  to  hear  or  consider  any  other  action  against  the 
United States or its agents relating to any aspect of the 
detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or conditions of con-
finement  of  an  alien  who  is  or  was  detained  by  the 
United  States  and  has  been  determined  by  the  United 
States to have been properly detained as an enemy com-
batant or is awaiting such determination." 

Section 7(b) of the MCA provides the effective date for the 
amendment of $ 2241(e).  It states: 

"The amendment made by [MCA $ 7(a)] shall take effect 
on the date of the enactment of this Act, and shall apply 
to  all  cases,  without  exception,  pending  on  or  after  the

date  of  the  enactment  of  this  Act  which  relate  to  any aspect of the detention, transfer, treatment, trial, or con-

ditions  of  detention  of  an  alien  detained  by  the  United States since September 11, 2001."  120 Stat. 2636. 

There  is  little  doubt  that  the  effective  date  provision  ap-plies to habeas corpus actions.  Those actions, by definition, 
are cases "which relate  to . . . detention."  See Black's Law Dictionary  728  (8th  ed.  2004)  (defining  habeas  corpus  as  "[a] 
writ  employed  to  bring  a  person  before  a  court,  most  fre-quently to ensure that the party's imprisonment or detention 
is  not  illegal").  Petitioners  argue,  nevertheless,  that  MCA $ 7(b)  is  not  a  sufficiently  clear  statement  of  congressional 
intent  to  strip  the  federal  courts  of  jurisdiction  in  pending cases.  See 

Ex  parte  Yerger,  8  Wall.  85,  102-103  (1869). We disagree. 

Their  argument  is  as  follows:  Section  2241(e)(1)  refers  to "a writ of habeas corpus."  The next paragraph, $ 2241(e)(2), 
refers  to  "any  other  action  .  .  .  relating  to  any  aspect  of  the detention,  transfer,  treatment,  trial,  or  conditions  of  con-
finement  of  an  alien  who  .  .  .  [has]  been  properly  detained as  an  enemy  combatant  or  is  awaiting  such  determination." 
There are two separate paragraphs, the argument continues, so  there  must  be  two  distinct  classes  of  cases.  And  the  ef-
fective  date subsection,  MCA $ 7(b),  it  is  said,  refers  only  to the  second class of cases, for  it  largely repeats the  language 
of $ 2241(e)(2)  by referring  to "cases . . . which  relate to any aspect  of  the  detention,  transfer,  treatment,  trial,  or  condi-
tions of detention of an alien detained by the United States." Petitioners' textual argument would have more force were 
it  not  for  the  phrase  "other  action"  in  $ 2241(e)(2).  The phrase  cannot  be  understood  without  referring  back  to  the 
paragraph that precedes it, $ 2241(e)(1), which explicitly men-tions  the  term  "writ  of  habeas  corpus."  The  structure  of 
the  two  paragraphs  implies  that  habeas  actions  are  a  type of  action  "relating  to  any  aspect  of  the  detention,  transfer, 
treatment, trial, or conditions of confinement of an alien who

is  or  was  detained  .  .  .  as  an  enemy  combatant."  Pending habeas  actions,  then,  are  in  the  category  of  cases  subject  to 

the statute's jurisdictional bar. We  acknowledge,  moreover,  the  litigation  history  that 
prompted  Congress  to  enact  the  MCA.  In  Hamdan  the Court  found  it  unnecessary  to  address  the  petitioner's  Sus-
pension  Clause  arguments  but  noted  the  relevance  of  the 
clear statement rule in  deciding whether Congress intended to reach pending habeas corpus cases.  See 548 U. S., at 575 

(Congress  should  "not  be  presumed  to  have  effected  such denial  [of  habeas  relief]  absent  an  unmistakably  clear  state-
ment  to  the  contrary").  This  interpretive  rule  facilitates  a 
dialogue  between  Congress  and  the  Court.  Cf.  Hilton  v. 
South Carolina Public Railways Comm'n, 502 U. S. 197, 206 
(1991);  H.  Hart  &  A.  Sacks,  The  Legal  Process:  Basic  Prob-
lems  in  the  Making  and  Application  of  Law  1209-1210  (W. 
Eskridge  &  P.  Frickey  eds.  1994).  If  the  Court  invokes  a

pretations  are  favored  in  order  to  avoid  constitutional  diffi-
culties,  Congress  can  make  an  informed  legislative  choice 
either to amend the statute or to retain its existing text.  If 
Congress amends, its intent must be respected even if a dif-
ficult  constitutional  question  is  presented.  The  usual  pre-
sumption  is  that  Members  of  Congress,  in  accord  with  their 
oath  of  office,  considered  the  constitutional  issue  and  de-
termined  the  amended  statute  to  be  a  lawful  one;  and  the 
Judiciary, in light  of that determination, proceeds to its own 
independent  judgment  on  the  constitutional  question  when 
required to do so in a proper case. 

If this  ongoing dialogue between and among the branches 
of Government is to be respected, we cannot ignore that the 
MCA  was  a  direct  response  to  Hamdan's  holding  that  the 
DTA's  jurisdiction-stripping  provision  had  no  application  to 
pending  cases.  The  Court  of  Appeals  was  correct  to  take 
note  of  the  legislative  history  when  construing  the  statute, 
see  476  F.  3d,  at  986,  n.  2  (citing  relevant  floor  statements);

Opinion of the Court 
and we agree with its conclusion that the MCA deprives the federal  courts  of  jurisdiction  to  entertain  the  habeas  corpus 

actions now before us.  III 

In deciding the constitutional questions now presented we must determine whether petitioners are barred from seeking 
the writ or invoking the protections of the Suspension Clause either  because  of  their  status,  i. e.,  petitioners'  designation 
by  the  Executive  Branch  as  enemy  combatants,  or  their physical  location, 

i. e.,  their  presence  at  Guantanamo  Bay. The  Government  contends  that  noncitizens  designated  as 

enemy  combatants  and  detained  in  territory  located  outside our  Nation's  borders  have  no  constitutional  rights  and  no 
privilege  of  habeas  corpus.  Petitioners  contend  they  do have  cognizable  constitutional  rights  and  that  Congress,  in 
seeking  to  eliminate  recourse  to  habeas  corpus  as  a  means to  assert  those  rights,  acted  in  violation  of  the  Suspension 
Clause. We  begin  with  a  brief  account  of  the  history  and  origins 
of  the  writ.  Our  account  proceeds  from  two  propositions. First,  protection  for  the  privilege  of  habeas  corpus  was  one 
of  the  few  safeguards  of  liberty  specified  in  a  Constitution that,  at  the  outset,  had  no  Bill  of  Rights.  In  the  system 
conceived by the Framers the writ had a centrality that must inform  proper  interpretation  of  the  Suspension  Clause. 
Second, to the extent there were settled precedents or legal commentaries in 1789 regarding the extraterritorial scope of 
the writ or its application to enemy aliens, those authorities can be instructive for the present cases. 

A 
The Framers viewed freedom from unlawful restraint as a fundamental precept of liberty, and they understood the writ 

of  habeas  corpus  as  a  vital  instrument  to  secure  that  free-dom.  Experience  taught,  however,  that  the  common-law 
writ  all  too  often  had  been  insufficient  to  guard  against  the

Opinion of the Court 
abuse  of  monarchial  power.  That  history  counseled  the  ne-cessity for specific language in the Constitution to secure the 

writ and ensure its place in our legal system. Magna  Carta  decreed  that  no  man  would  be  imprisoned 
contrary  to  the  law  of  the  land.  Art.  39,  in  Sources  of  Our Liberties 17 (R. Perry &  J. Cooper  eds. 1959) ("No free man 
shall be taken or imprisoned or dispossessed, or outlawed, or 
banished, or in any way destroyed, nor will we go upon him, nor send upon him, except by the legal judgment of his peers 

or by the law of the land").  Important as the principle was, the  Barons  at  Runnymede  prescribed  no  specific  legal  proc-
ess to enforce it.  Holdsworth tells us, however, that gradu-
ally  the  writ  of  habeas  corpus  became  the  means  by  which 
the  promise  of  Magna  Carta  was  fulfilled.  9  W.  Holds-
worth,  A  History  of  English  Law  112  (1926)  (hereinafter 
Holdsworth). 

The  development  was  painstaking,  even  by  the  centuries-
long  measures  of  English  constitutional  history.  The  writ 
was  known  and  used  in  some  form  at  least  as  early  as  the 
reign  of  Edward  I.  Id.,  at  108-125.  Yet  at  the  outset  it 
was  used  to  protect  not  the  rights  of  citizens  but  those  of 
the  King  and  his  courts.  The  early  courts  were considered 
agents of the Crown, designed to assist the King in the exer-
cise of his power.  See J. Baker, An Introduction to English 
Legal History  38-39 (4th ed.  2002).  Thus the writ, while it 
would become part of the foundation of liberty for the King's 
subjects,  was  in  its  earliest  use  a  mechanism  for  securing 
compliance  with  the  King's  laws.  See  Halliday  &  White, 
The  Suspension  Clause:  English  Text,  Imperial  Contexts, 
and  American  Implications,  94  Va.  L.  Rev.  575,  585  (2008)

liberty")).  Over  time  it  became  clear  that  by  issuing  the

writ  of  habeas  corpus  common-law  courts  sought  to  enforce the King's prerogative to inquire into the authority of a jailer 

to  hold  a  prisoner.  See  M.  Hale,  Prerogatives  of  the  King 229 (D. Yale ed. 1976); 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Con-
stitution of the United States $ 1341, p. 237 (3d ed. 1858) (not-ing that the writ ran  "into all parts of the king's dominions; 
for it is said, that the king is entitled, at all times, to have an 
account, why the liberty of any of his subjects is restrained"). Even  so,  from  an  early  date  it  was  understood  that  the 

King,  too,  was  subject  to  the  law.  As  the  writers  said  of Magna  Carta,  "it  means  this,  that  the  king  is  and  shall  be 
below the law."  1 F. Pollock & F. Maitland, History of Eng-
lish  Law  173  (2d  ed.  1909);  see  also  2  Bracton  On  the  Laws 
and  Customs  of  England  33  (S.  Thorne  transl.  1968)  ("The 
king  must  not  be  under  man  but  under  God  and  under  the 
law, because  law makes  the king").  And, by the 1600's,  the 
writ  was  deemed  less  an  instrument  of  the  King's  power 
and more a restraint upon  it.  See Collings,  Habeas Corpus 
for  Convicts--Constitutional  Right  or  Legislative  Grace,  40 
Cal.  L.  Rev.  335,  336  (1952)  (noting  that  by  this  point  the 
writ  was  "the  appropriate  process  for  checking  illegal  im-
prisonment by public officials"). 

Still,  the  writ  proved  to  be  an  imperfect  check.  Even 
when the importance of the writ was well understood in Eng-
land,  habeas  relief  often  was  denied  by  the  courts  or  sus-
pended  by  Parliament.  Denial  or  suspension  occurred  in 
times  of  political  unrest,  to  the  anguish  of  the  imprisoned 
and the outrage of those in sympathy with them. 

A  notable  example  from  this  period  was  Darnel's  Case,  3 
How.  St.  Tr.  1  (K.  B.  1627).  The  events  giving  rise  to  the 
case began when, in a display of the Stuart penchant for au-
thoritarian  excess,  Charles  I  demanded  that  Darnel  and  at 
least  four  others  lend  him  money.  Upon  their  refusal,  they 
were  imprisoned.  The  prisoners  sought  a  writ  of  habeas 
corpus;  and the  King  filed a  return  in the  form of a  warrant 
signed by the Attorney General.  Ibid.  The court held this

was  a sufficient  answer  and  justified the  subjects'  continued imprisonment. 

Id., at 59. 
There was an immediate outcry of protest.  The House of Commons  promptly  passed  the  Petition  of  Right,  3  Car.  1, 

ch.  1  (1627),  5  Statutes  of  the  Realm  23,  24  (reprint  1963), which  condemned  executive  "imprison[ment]  without  any 
cause"  shown,  and  declared  that  "no  freeman  in  any  such 
manner  as  is  before  mencioned  [shall]  be  imprisoned  or  de-teined."  Yet  a  full  legislative  response  was  long  delayed. 

The  King  soon  began  to  abuse  his  authority  again,  and  Par-liament was dissolved.  See W. Hall & R. Albion, A History 
of England and the British Empire 328 (3d ed. 1953) (herein-
after Hall & Albion).  When Parliament reconvened in 1640, 
it  sought  to  secure  access  to  the  writ  by  statute.  The  Act 
of  1640,  16  Car.  1,  ch.  10,  5  Statutes  of  the  Realm,  at  110, 
expressly  authorized  use  of  the  writ  to  test  the  legality  of 
commitment  by  command  or  warrant  of  the  King  or  the 
Privy  Council.  Civil  strife  and  the  Interregnum  soon  fol-
lowed,  and  not  until  1679  did  Parliament  try  once  more  to 
secure the writ, this time through the Habeas Corpus Act of 
1679, 31 Car. 2, ch. 2, id., at 935.  The Act, which later would 
be  described  by  Blackstone  as  the  "stable  bulwark  of  our 
liberties," 1  W.  Blackstone, Commentaries *137  (hereinafter 
Blackstone),  established  procedures  for  issuing  the  writ; 
and  it  was  the  model  upon  which  the  habeas  statutes  of  the 
13  American  Colonies  were  based,  see  Collings,  supra,  at 
338-339. 

This history was known to the Framers.  It no doubt con-
firmed  their  view  that  pendular  swings  to  and  away  from 
individual  liberty  were  endemic  to  undivided,  uncontrolled 
power.  The  Framers'  inherent  distrust  of  governmental 
power  was  the  driving  force  behind  the  constitutional  plan 
that  allocated  powers  among  three  independent  branches. 
This design serves not only to make Government accountable 
but  also  to  secure  individual  liberty.  See  Loving  v.  United 
States,  517  U. S.  748,  756  (1996)  (noting  that  "[e]ven  before

Opinion of the Court 
State  Conventions  on  the  Adoption  of the  Federal Constitu-
tion 460-464 (J. Elliot 2d ed.  1876).  A  resolution passed by 
the  New  York  ratifying  convention  made  clear  its  under-
standing that the Clause not  only  protects against  arbitrary 
suspensions  of  the  writ  but  also  guarantees  an  affirmative 
right  to  judicial  inquiry  into  the  causes  of  detention.  See 
Resolution  of  the  New  York  Ratifying  Convention  (July  26, 
1788), in 1 id., at 328 (noting the convention's understanding 
"[t]hat every person restrained of his liberty is entitled to an 
inquiry  into  the  lawfulness  of  such  restraint,  and  to  a  re-
moval  thereof  if  unlawful;  and  that  such  inquiry  or  removal 
ought  not  to  be  denied  or  delayed,  except  when,  on  account 
of public danger, the Congress shall suspend the privilege of 
the  writ  of  habeas  corpus").  Alexander  Hamilton  likewise 
explained that by  providing  the  detainee a judicial  forum  to 
challenge detention, the writ preserves limited government. 
As he explained in The Federalist No. 84: 

"[T]he  practice  of  arbitrary  imprisonments,  have  been, 
in all ages, the favorite and most formidable instruments 
of  tyranny.  The  observations  of  the  judicious  Black-
stone  .  .  .  are  well  worthy  of  recital:  `To  bereave  a  man 
of  life  . . . or  by violence to confiscate his estate, without 
accusation  or  trial,  would  be  so  gross  and  notorious  an 
act  of  despotism  as  must  at  once  convey  the  alarm  of 
tyranny  throughout  the  whole  nation;  but  confinement 
of  the  person,  by  secretly  hurrying  him  to  jail,  where 
his sufferings are unknown or forgotten, is a less public, 
a  less  striking,  and  therefore  a  more  dangerous  engine 
of  arbitrary  government.'  And  as  a  remedy  for  this 
fatal  evil  he  is  everywhere  peculiarly  emphatical  in  his 
encomiums on the habeas corpus act, which in one place 
he calls `the bulwark

Opinion of the Court 
Post-1789  habeas  developments  in  England,  though  not 
bearing  upon  the  Framers'  intent,  do  verify  their  foresight. 
Those later events would underscore the need for structural 
barriers  against  arbitrary  suspensions  of  the  writ.  Just  as 
the writ had been vulnerable to executive and parliamentary 
encroachment on both sides of the Atlantic before the Ameri-
can  Revolution,  despite  the  Habeas  Corpus  Act  of  1679,  the 
writ was suspended with frequency in England during times 
of  political  unrest  after  1789.  Parliament  suspended  the 
writ  for  much  of  the  period  from  1792  to  1801,  resulting  in 
rampant  arbitrary  imprisonment.  See  Hall  &  Albion  550. 
Even as late as World War I, at least one prominent English 
jurist  complained  that  the  Defence  of  the  Realm  Act,  1914, 
4 & 5 Geo. 5, ch. 29(1)(a), effectively had suspended the privi-
lege of habeas corpus for any person suspected of "communi-
cating with the enemy."  See King v.  Halliday, [1917] A. C. 
260,  299  (Lord  Shaw,  dissenting);  see  generally  A.  Simpson, 
In  the  Highest  Degree  Odious:  Detention  Without  Trial  in 
Wartime Britain 6-7, 24-25 (1992). 

In  our  own  system  the  Suspension  Clause  is  designed  to 
protect  against  these  cyclical  abuses.  The  Clause  protects 
the  rights  of  the  detained  by  a  means  consistent  with  the 
essential design of the Constitution.  It ensures that, except 
during  periods of formal suspension,  the  Judiciary will have 
a time-tested device, the  writ, to maintain the "delicate  bal-
ance of governance" that is itself the surest safeguard of lib-
erty.  See Hamdi, 542 U. S., at 536 (plurality opinion).  The 
Clause  protects  the  rights  of  the  detained  by  affirming  the 
duty  and  authority  of  the  Judiciary  to  call  the  jailer  to  ac-
count.  See  Preiser  v.  Rodriguez,  411  U. S.  475,  484  (1973) 
("[T]he essence of habeas corpus is an attack  by a  person in 
custody upon the legality of that custody"); cf. In re Jackson, 
15  Mich.  417,  439-440  (1867)  (Cooley,  J.,  concurring)  ("The 
important fact to be observed in regard to the mode of proce-
dure  upon  this  [habeas]  writ  is,  that  it  is  directed  to,  and

Opinion of the Court 
served  upon,  not  the  person  confined,  but  his  jailer").  The separation-of-powers  doctrine,  and  the  history  that  influ-

enced  its  design,  therefore  must  inform  the  reach  and  pur-pose of the Suspension Clause. 

B 
The broad  historical narrative of the writ and its function is central to our analysis, but we seek guidance as well from 

founding-era authorities addressing the specific question be-fore  us:  whether  foreign  nationals,  apprehended  and  de-
tained  in  distant  countries  during  a  time  of  serious  threats to our Nation's security, may assert the privilege of the writ 
and  seek  its  protection.  The  Court  has  been  careful  not  to foreclose  the  possibility  that  the  protections  of  the  Suspen-
sion  Clause  have  expanded  along  with  post-1789  develop-ments that define the present scope of the writ.  See 

INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U. S. 289, 300-301 (2001).  But the analysis may 

begin with precedents as of 1789, for the Court has said that "at  the  absolute  minimum"  the  Clause  protects  the  writ  as 
it  existed  when  the  Constitution  was  drafted  and  ratified. 
Id., at 301. To  support  their  arguments,  the  parties  in  these  cases 

have  examined  historical  sources  to  construct  a  view  of  the common-law writ as it existed in 1789--as have 

amici whose expertise  in  legal  history  the  Court  has  relied  upon  in  the 

past.  See  Brief  for  Legal  Historians  as  Amici  Curiae;  see also 

St.  Cyr,  supra,  at  302,  n.  16.  The  Government  argues the common-law writ ran only to those territories over which 

the  Crown  was  sovereign.  See  Brief  for  Federal  Respond-ents  27.  Petitioners  argue  that  jurisdiction  followed  the 
King's  officers.  See  Brief  for  Petitioner  Boumediene  et  al. 11.  Diligent search by all parties reveals no certain conclu-
sions.  In none of the cases cited do we find that a common-law  court  would  or  would  not  have  granted,  or  refused  to 
hear  for  lack  of  jurisdiction,  a  petition  for  a  writ  of  habeas corpus  brought  by  a  prisoner  deemed  an  enemy  combatant,

under  a  standard  like  the  one  the  Department  of  Defense has  used  in  these  cases,  and  when  held  in  a  territory,  like 

Guantanamo,  over  which  the  Government  has  total  military and civil control. 

We  know  that  at  common  law  a  petitioner's  status  as  an alien was not a categorical bar to habeas corpus relief.  See, 
e. g.,  Sommersett's  Case,  20  How.  St.  Tr.  1,  80-82  (1772)  (or-
dering  an  African  slave  freed  upon  finding  the  custodian's return insufficient); see generally 

Khera v.  Secretary of State 
for  the  Home  Dept.,  [1984]  A.  C.  74,  111  ("Habeas  corpus protection is often expressed as limited to `British subjects.' 

Is  it  really  limited  to  British  nationals?  Suffice  it  to  say 
that  the  case  law  has  given  an  emphatic  `no'  to  the  ques-
tion").  We  know  as  well  that  common-law  courts  enter-
tained habeas petitions brought by enemy aliens detained in 
England--"entertained" at least in the sense that the courts 
held hearings to determine the threshold question of entitle-
ment  to  the  writ.  See  Case  of  Three  Spanish  Sailors,  2 
Black.  W.  1324,  96  Eng.  Rep.  775  (C.  P.  1779);  King  v. 
Schiever, 2 Burr. 765, 97 Eng. Rep. 551 (K. B. 1759); Du Cas-
tro's Case, Fort. 195, 92 Eng. Rep. 816 (K. B. 1697). 

In  Schiever  and  the  Spanish  Sailors'  case,  the  courts  de-
nied relief to the petitioners.  Whether the holdings in these 
cases  were  jurisdictional  or  based  upon  the  courts'  ruling 
that  the  petitioners  were  detained  lawfully  as  prisoners  of 
war is unclear.  See Spanish Sailors, supra, at 1324, 96 Eng. 
Rep.,  at  776;  Schiever,  supra,  at  766,  97  Eng.  Rep.,  at  552. 
In  Du  Castro's  Case,  the  court  granted  relief,  but  that  case 
is  not  analogous  to  petitioners'  because  the  prisoner  there 
appears to  have been detained in  England.  See Halliday & 
White 27, n. 72.  To the extent these authorities suggest the 
common-law  courts  abstained  altogether  from  matters  in-
volving  prisoners  of  war,  there  was  greater  justification  for 
doing  so  in  the  context  of  declared  wars  with  other  nation 
states.  Judicial  intervention  might  have  complicated  the 
military's ability to negotiate exchange of prisoners with the

enemy, a wartime practice well known to the Framers.  See Resolution  of  Mar.  30,  1778,  10  Journals  of  the  Continental 

Congress 1774-1789, p. 295 (W. Ford ed. 1908) (directing Gen-eral  Washington  not  to  exchange  prisoners  with  the  British 
unless  the  enemy  agreed  to  exempt  citizens  from  capture). We  find  the  evidence  as  to  the  geographic  scope  of  the 
writ  at  common  law  informative,  but,  again,  not  dispositive. 
Petitioners  argue  the  site  of  their  detention  is  analogous  to two territories outside of England to which the writ did run: 

the  so-called  "exempt  jurisdictions,"  like  the  Channel  Is-lands; and (in former times) India.  There are critical differ-
ences between these places and Guantanamo, however. 

As  the  Court  noted  in  Rasul,  542  U. S.,  at  481-482,  and 
nn.  11-12,  common-law  courts  granted  habeas  corpus  relief 
to prisoners detained in the exempt jurisdictions.  But these 
areas, while not in theory part of the realm of England, were 
nonetheless  under  the  Crown's  control.  See  2  H.  Hallam, 
Constitutional  History  of  England:  From  the  Accession  of 
Henry  VII  to  the  Death  of  George  II,  pp.  232-233  (reprint 
1989).  And there is some indication that these jurisdictions 
were considered sovereign territory.  King v.  Cowle, 2 Burr. 
834, 854, 855, 856, 97 Eng. Rep. 587, 599 (K. B. 1759) (describ-
ing one of the exempt jurisdictions, Berwick-upon-Tweed, as 
under  the  "sovereign  jurisdiction"  and  "subjection  of  the 
Crown  of  England").  Because  the  United  States  does  not 
maintain  formal  sovereignty  over  Guantanamo  Bay,  see 
Part IV, infra, the naval station there and the exempt juris-
dictions  discussed  in  the  English  authorities  are  not  simi-
larly situated. 

Petitioners and their  amici further rely on cases in which 
British courts in India granted writs of habeas corpus to non-
citizens  detained  in  territory  over  which  the  Moghul  Em-
peror  retained  formal  sovereignty  and  control.  See  Brief 
for Petitioner Boumediene et al. 12-13; Brief for Legal Histo-
rians  as  Amici  Curiae  12-13.  The  analogy  to  the  present 
cases breaks down, however, because of the geographic loca-

tion  of  the  courts  in  the  Indian  example.  The  Supreme Court  of  Judicature  (the  British  Court)  sat  in  Calcutta;  but 

no  federal  court  sits  at  Guantanamo.  The  Supreme  Court of Judicature was, moreover, a special court set up by Parlia-
ment  to  monitor  certain  conduct  during  the  British  Raj. See Regulating Act of 1773, 13 Geo. 3, ch. 63, $$ 13-14.  That 
it had  the power  to issue the  writ in  nonsovereign  territory 
does  not  prove  that  common-law  courts  sitting  in  England had the same power.  If petitioners were to have the better 

of  the  argument  on  this  point,  we  would  need  some  dem-onstration  of  a  consistent  practice  of  common-law  courts 
sitting  in  England  and  entertaining  petitions  brought  by 
alien  prisoners  detained  abroad.  We  find  little  support  for 
this conclusion. 

The Government argues, in turn, that Guantanamo is more 
closely  analogous  to  Scotland  and  Hanover,  territories  that 
were  not  part  of  England  but  nonetheless  controlled  by  the 
English monarch (in his separate capacities as King of Scot-
land  and  Elector  of  Hanover).  See  Cowle,  2  Burr.,  at  856, 
97  Eng.  Rep.,  at  600.  Lord  Mansfield  can  be  cited  for  the 
proposition  that, at the  time  of the  founding,  English courts 
lacked  the  "power"  to  issue  the  writ  to  Scotland  and  Han-
over,  territories  Lord  Mansfield  referred  to  as  "foreign." 
Ibid.  But  what  matters  for  our  purposes  is  why  common-
law  courts  lacked  this  power.  Given  the  English  Crown's 
delicate  and  complicated  relationships  with  Scotland  and 
Hanover  in  the  1700's,  we  cannot  disregard  the  possibility 
that the common-law courts' refusal to issue the writ to these 
places  was  motivated  not  by  formal  legal  constructs  but  by 
what  we  would  think  of  as  prudential  concerns.  This  ap-
pears  to  have  been  the  case  with  regard  to  other  British 
territories where the writ did not run.  See 2 R. Chambers, 
A  Course  of  Lectures  on  English  Law  1767-1773,  p.  8  (T. 
Curley  ed.  1986)  (discussing  the  view  of  Lord  Mansfield  in

have, yet where they cannot judge of the cause, or give relief

Opinion of the Court 
upon it, they would not think proper to interpose; and there-fore  in  the  case  of  imprisonments  in 

Guernsey,  Jersey,  Mi-
norca, or the plantations, the most usual way is to complain to the 

king in Council" (internal quotation marks omitted)). 
And after the Act of Union in 1707, through which the king-doms  of  England  and  Scotland  were  merged  politically, 

Queen Anne and her successors, in their new capacity as sov-
ereign  of  Great  Britain,  ruled  the  entire  island  as  one  king-dom.  Accordingly,  by  the  time  Lord  Mansfield  penned  his 

opinion in Cowle in 1759, Scotland was no longer a "foreign" country vis-a` -vis England--at least not in the sense in which 
Cuba is a foreign country vis-a` -vis the United States. 

Scotland  remained  "foreign"  in  Lord  Mansfield's  day  in  at 
least  one  important  respect,  however.  Even  after  the  Act 
of  Union,  Scotland  (like  Hanover)  continued  to  maintain  its 
own  laws  and  court  system.  See  1  Blackstone  *98,  *106. 
Under  these  circumstances  prudential  considerations  would 
have  weighed  heavily  when  courts  sitting  in  England  re-
ceived  habeas  petitions  from  Scotland  or  the  Electorate. 
Common-law  decisions  withholding  the  writ  from  prisoners 
detained  in  these  places  easily  could  be  explained  as  efforts 
to avoid either or both of two embarrassments: conflict with 
the judgments of another court of competent jurisdiction; or 
the  practical  inability,  by  reason  of  distance,  of  the  English 
courts  to  enforce  their  judgments  outside  their  territorial 
jurisdiction.  Cf. Munaf v.  Geren, ante, at 693 (opinion of the 
Court)  (recognizing  that  " `prudential  concerns'  .  .  .  such  as 
comity  and  the  orderly  administration  of  criminal  justice" 
affect the appropriate exercise of habeas jurisdiction). 

By  the  mid-19th  century,  British  courts  could  issue  the 
writ  to  Canada,  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  Canadian 
courts  also  had  the  power  to  do  so.  See  9  Holdsworth  124, 
and  n.  6  (citing  Ex  parte  Anderson,  3  El.  and  El.  487,  121 
Eng. Rep. 525 (K. B. 1861)).  This might be seen as evidence 
that the existence of a separate court system was no barrier 
to the  running of the  common-law writ.  The Canada of the

Opinion of the Court 
1800's, however, was in many respects more analogous to the exempt jurisdictions  or to Ireland,  where the  writ  ran, than 

to Scotland or Hanover in the 1700's, where it did not.  Un-like  Scotland  and  Hanover,  Canada  followed  English  law. 
See  B.  Laskin,  The  British  Tradition  in  Canadian  Law 50-51 (1969). 

In  the  end  a  categorical  or  formal  conception  of  sover-eignty 

does not provide a comprehensive or altogether satis-factory  explanation  for  the  general  understanding  that  pre-

vailed  when  Lord  Mansfield  considered  issuance  of  the  writ outside  England.  In  1759  the  writ  did  not  run  to  Scotland 
but  did  run  to  Ireland,  even  though,  at  that  point,  Scotland 
and  England  had  merged  under  the  rule  of  a  single  sover-
eign,  whereas  the  Crowns  of  Great  Britain  and  Ireland  re-
mained  separate  (at  least  in  theory).  See  Cowle,  supra,  at 
856-857, 97 Eng. Rep., at 600; 1 Blackstone *100-*101.  But 
there  was  at  least  one  major  difference  between  Scotland's 
and  Ireland's  relationship  with  England  during  this  period 
that  might  explain  why  the  writ  ran  to  Ireland  but  not  to 
Scotland.  English  law  did  not  generally  apply  in  Scotland 
(even  after  the  Act  of  Union),  but  it  did  apply  in  Ireland. 
Blackstone put it as follows: "[A]s Scotland and England are 
now one and the same kingdom, and yet differ in their munic-
ipal  laws;  so  England  and  Ireland  are,  on  the  other  hand, 
distinct  kingdoms,  and  yet  in  general  agree  in  their  laws." 
Id.,  at  *100  (footnote  omitted).  This  distinction,  and  not 
formal  notions  of  sovereignty,  may  well  explain  why  the 
writ  did  not  run  to  Scotland  (and  Hanover)  but  would  run 
to Ireland. 

The prudential barriers that may have prevented the Eng-
lish  courts  from  issuing  the  writ  to  Scotland  and  Hanover 
are  not  relevant  here.  We  have  no  reason  to  believe  an 
order  from  a  federal  court  would  be  disobeyed  at  Guantan-
amo.  No  Cuban  court  has  jurisdiction  to  hear  these  peti-
tioners' claims, and no law other than the laws of the United 
States  applies  at  the  naval  station.  The  modern-day  rela-

Opinion of the Court 
tions between the United States and Guantanamo thus differ in  important  respects  from  the  18th-century  relations  be-

tween  England  and  the  kingdoms  of  Scotland  and  Hanover. This is reason enough for us to discount the relevance of the 
Government's analogy. Each side in the present matter argues that the very lack 
of  a  precedent  on  point  supports  its  position.  The  Govern-
ment  points  out  there  is  no  evidence  that  a  court  sitting  in England  granted  habeas  relief  to  an  enemy  alien  detained 

abroad; petitioners respond there is no evidence that a court refused to do so for lack of jurisdiction. 

Both arguments are premised, however, upon the assump-
tion that the  historical record is  complete  and that the  com-
mon  law,  if  properly  understood,  yields  a  definite  answer  to 
the  questions  before  us.  There  are  reasons  to  doubt  both 
assumptions.  Recent  scholarship  points  to  the  inherent 
shortcomings  in  the  historical  record.  See  Halliday  & 
White  14-15  (noting  that  most  reports  of  18th-century  ha-
beas  proceedings  were  not  printed).  And  given  the  unique 
status of Guantanamo Bay and the particular dangers of ter-
rorism  in  the  modern  age,  the  common-law  courts  simply 
may  not  have  confronted  cases  with  close  parallels  to  this 
one.  We  decline,  therefore,  to  infer  too  much,  one  way  or 
the  other,  from  the  lack  of  historical  evidence  on  point. 
Cf.  Brown  v.  Board  of  Education,  347  U. S.  483,  489  (1954) 
(noting  evidence  concerning  the  circumstances  surrounding 
the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, discussed in the

tigation, "convince us that, although these sources cast some

Opinion of the Court 

IV 
Drawing from its position that at common law the writ ran only to territories over which the Crown was sovereign, the 

Government  says  the  Suspension  Clause  affords  petitioners no  rights  because  the  United  States  does  not  claim  sover-
eignty over the place of detention. Guantanamo Bay is not formally part of the United States. 
See DTA  $ 1005(g), 119 Stat.  2743.  And under the  terms of the lease between the United States and Cuba, Cuba retains 
"ultimate  sovereignty"  over  the  territory  while  the  United States  exercises  "complete  jurisdiction  and  control."  See 
Lease of Lands for Coaling and Naval Stations, Feb. 23, 1903, U.  S.-Cuba,  Art.  III,  T.  S.  No.  418  (hereinafter  1903  Lease 
Agreement);  Rasul,  542  U. S.,  at  471.  Under  the  terms  of the 1934 treaty, however, Cuba effectively has no rights as a 
sovereign  until  the  parties agree  to modification of  the  1903 Lease  Agreement  or  the  United  States  abandons  the  base. 
See  Treaty  Defining  Relations  with  Cuba,  May  29,  1934, U. S.-Cuba, Art. III, 48 Stat. 1683, T. S. No. 866. 

The  United  States  contends,  nevertheless,  that  Guantan-amo  is  not  within  its  sovereign  control.  This  was  the  Gov-
ernment's  position  well  before  the  events  of  September  11, 2001.  See, 

e. g., Brief for Petitioners in Sale v.  Haitian Cen-ters Council, Inc., O. T. 1992, No. 92-344, p. 31 (arguing that 

Guantanamo is territory "outside the United States").  And in  other  contexts  the  Court  has  held  that  questions  of  sov-
ereignty  are  for  the  political  branches  to  decide.  See Vermilya-Brown  Co.  v.  Connell,  335  U. S.  377,  380  (1948) 
("[D]etermination of sovereignty over an area is for the leg-islative  and  executive  departments");  see  also  Jones  v. 
United States,  137 U. S. 202  (1890); Williams v.  Suffolk Ins. 
Co., 13 Pet. 415, 420 (1839).  Even if this were a treaty inter-pretation  case  that  did  not  involve  a  political  question,  the 

President's  construction  of  the  lease  agreement  would  be entitled  to  great  respect.  See  Sumitomo  Shoji  America, 
Inc. v.  Avagliano, 457 U. S. 176, 184-185 (1982).

754  BOUMEDIENE  v.  BUSH 

Opinion of the Court 
We  therefore  do  not  question  the  Government's  position that  Cuba,  not  the  United  States,  maintains  sovereignty,  in 

the  legal  and  technical  sense  of  the  term,  over  Guantanamo Bay.  But this does  not  end the analysis.  Our cases do not 
hold it is improper for us to inquire into the objective degree of  control  the  Nation  asserts  over  foreign  territory.  As 
commentators have  noted,  " `[s]overeignty'  is  a term used  in 
many  senses  and  is  much  abused."  See  1  Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States $ 206, 

Comment b, p. 94  (1986).  When we have stated that sover-eignty is a political question, we have referred not to sover-
eignty in the general, colloquial sense, meaning the exercise 
of dominion or power, see Webster's New International Dic-
tionary  2406  (2d  ed.  1934)  ("sovereignty,"  definition  3),  but 
sovereignty  in  the  narrow,  legal sense  of  the  term,  meaning 
a claim of right,  see 1 Restatement  (Third) of Foreign Rela-
tions,  supra,  $ 206,  Comment  b,  at  94  (noting  that  sover-
eignty "implies a state's lawful control over its territory gen-
erally to the exclusion of other states, authority to govern in 
that  territory,  and  authority  to  apply  law  there").  Indeed, 
it is not altogether uncommon for a territory to be under the 
de  jure  sovereignty  of  one  nation,  while  under  the  plenary 
control, or practical sovereignty,  of another.  This  condition 
can  occur  when  the  territory  is  seized  during  war,  as  Guan-
tanamo  was  during  the  Spanish-American  War.  See,  e. g., 
Fleming v.  Page, 9 How. 603, 614 (1850) (noting that the port 
of Tampico,  conquered  by  the  United  States  during  the  war 
with  Mexico,  was  "undoubtedly . . .  subject  to  the  sover-
eignty and dominion of the United States," but that it "does 
not  follow  that  it  was  a  part  of  the  United  States,  or  that  it 
ceased  to  be  a  foreign  country");  King  v.  Earl  of  Crewe  ex 
parte  Sekgome,  [1910]  2  K.  B.  576,  603-604  (C.  A.)  (opinion 
of Williams, L. J.) (arguing that the Bechuanaland Protector-
ate  in  South  Africa  was  "under  His  Majesty's  dominion  in 
the sense  of power  and jurisdiction,  but is not  under  his do-
minion  in  the  sense  of  territorial  dominion").  Accordingly,

Opinion of the Court 
for purposes of our analysis, we accept the Government's po-sition  that  Cuba,  and  not  the  United  States,  retains  de  jure 

sovereignty  over  Guantanamo  Bay.  As  we  did  in  Rasul, however, we take notice of the obvious and uncontested fact 
that the United States, by virtue of its complete jurisdiction and  control  over  the  base,  maintains 

de  facto  sovereignty over  this  territory.  See  542  U. S.,  at  480;  id.,  at 487  (

guaranteed  constitutional  protections  to  the  inhabitants  by statute.  See, 

e. g., An Act: to establish a Territorial Govern-
ment for Utah, $ 17, 9 Stat. 458 ("[T]he Constitution and laws of the United States are hereby extended over and declared 

to  be  in  force  in  said  Territory  of  Utah");  Rev.  Stat.  $ 1891 ("The  Constitution  and  all  laws  of  the  United  States  which 
are  not  locally  inapplicable  shall  have  the  same  force  and 
effect within all the organized Territories, and in every Ter-ritory  hereafter  organized  as  elsewhere  within  the  United 

States");  see  generally  Burnett,  Untied  States:  American Expansion  and  Territorial  Deannexation,  72  U.  Chi.  L.  Rev. 
797, 825-827 (2005).  In particular, there was no need to test 
the limits of the Suspension Clause because, as early as 1789, 
Congress  extended  the  writ  to  the  Territories.  See  Act  of 
Aug.  7,  1789,  1  Stat.  52  (reaffirming  Art.  II  of  Northwest 
Ordinance  of  1787,  which  provided  that  "[t]he  inhabitants  of 
the  said  territory,  shall  always  be  entitled  to  the  benefits  of 
the writ of habeas corpus"). 

Fundamental  questions  regarding  the  Constitution's  geo-
graphic  scope  first  arose  at  the  dawn  of  the  20th  century 
when the Nation acquired noncontiguous Territories: Puerto 
Rico, Guam, and the Philippines--ceded to the United States 
by  Spain  at  the  conclusion  of  the  Spanish-American  War-- 
and Hawaii--annexed by the United States in 1898.  At this 
point  Congress  chose  to  discontinue  its  previous  practice  of 
extending constitutional rights to the Territories by statute. 
See, e. g., An Act Temporarily to provide for the administra-
tion  of  the  affairs  of  civil  government  in  the  Philippine  Is-
lands,  and  for  other  purposes,  32 Stat.  692  (noting  that  Rev. 
Stat. $ 1891 did not apply to the Philippines). 

In  a  series  of  opinions  later  known  as  the  Insular  Cases, 
the  Court  addressed  whether  the  Constitution,  by  its  own 
force,  applies  in  any  territory  that  is  not  a  State.  See  De 
Lima v.  Bidwell, 182 U. S. 1 (1901); Dooley v.  United States, 
182  U. S.  222  (1901);  Armstrong  v.  United  States,  182  U. S. 
243  (1901);  Downes  v.  Bidwell,  182  U. S.  244  (1901);  Hawaii

Opinion of the Court 
v.  Mankichi, 190 U. S. 197 (1903); Dorr v.  United States, 195 U. S.  138  (1904).  The  Court  held  that  the  Constitution  has 

independent force in these Territories, a force not contingent upon  acts  of  legislative  grace.  Yet  it  took  note  of  the  diffi-
culties inherent in that position. Prior  to  their  cession  to  the  United  States,  the  former 
Spanish  colonies  operated  under  a  civil-law  system,  without 
experience  in  the  various  aspects  of  the  Anglo-American legal tradition, for instance the use of grand and petit juries. 

At least with regard to the Philippines, a complete transfor-mation  of  the  prevailing  legal  culture  would  have  been  not 
only  disruptive  but  also  unnecessary,  as  the  United  States 
intended  to  grant  independence  to  that  Territory.  See  An 
Act To declare the purpose of the people of the United States 
as to the future political status of the people of the Philippine 
Islands,  and  to  provide  a  more  autonomous  government  for 
those  islands  (Jones  Act),  39  Stat.  545  (noting  that  "it  was 
never the intention of the people of the United States in the 
incipiency of the War with Spain to make it a war of conquest 
or  for  territorial  aggrandizement"  and  that  "it  is,  as  it  has 
always  been, the purpose  of the people of the  United  States 
to  withdraw  their  sovereignty  over  the  Philippine  Islands 
and to recognize their independence as soon as a stable gov-
ernment  can  be  established  therein").  The  Court  thus  was 
reluctant  to  risk  the  uncertainty  and  instability  that  could 
result from a rule that displaced altogether the existing legal 
systems  in  these  newly  acquired  Territories.  See  Downes, 
supra, at 282 ("It is  obvious that in the annexation of outly-
ing  and  distant  possessions  grave  questions  will  arise  from 
differences  of  race,  habits,  laws  and  customs  of  the  people, 
and  from  differences  of  soil,  climate  and  production  .  .  .  "). 

These considerations resulted in the doctrine of territorial 
incorporation, under which the Constitution applies in full in 
incorporated  Territories  surely  destined  for  statehood  but 
only in part in unincorporated Territories.  See Dorr, supra, 
at 143  ("Until  Congress shall see  fit  to incorporate  territory

ceded  by  treaty  into  the  United  States, . . . the  territory  is 
to  be  governed  under  the  power  existing  in  Congress  to 
make  laws  for  such  territories  and  subject  to  such  constitu-
tional restrictions upon the powers of that body as are appli-
cable  to  the  situation");  Downes,  supra,  at  293  (White,  J., 
concurring)  ("[T]he  determination  of  what  particular  provi-
sion  of  the  Constitution  is  applicable,  generally  speaking,  in 
all  cases,  involves  an  inquiry  into  the  situation  of  the  terri-
tory  and its  relations  to  the  United  States").  As the  Court 
later  made  clear,  "the  real  issue  in  the  Insular  Cases  was 
not whether the Constitution extended to the Philippines or 
Porto  Rico  when  we  went  there, but  which  of  its  provisions 
were  applicable  by  way  of  limitation  upon  the  exercise  of 
executive  and  legislative  power  in  dealing  with  new  condi-
tions  and  requirements."  Balzac  v.  Porto  Rico,  258  U. S. 
298,  312  (1922).  It  may  well  be  that  over  time  the  ties  be-
tween the United States and any of its unincorporated Terri-
tories  strengthen  in  ways  that  are  of  constitutional  signifi-
cance.  Cf.  Torres  v.  Puerto  Rico,  442  U. S.  465,  475-476 
(1979) (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) ("Whatever the 
validity of the [Insular Cases] in the particular historical con-
text  in  which they  were decided, those cases are  clearly not 
authority  for  questioning  the  application  of  the  Fourth 
Amendment--or  any  other  provision  of  the  Bill  of  Rights-- 
to  the  Commonwealth  of  Puerto  Rico  in  the  1970's").  But, 
as  early  as  Balzac  in  1922,  the  Court  took  for  granted  that 
even  in  unincorporated  Territories  the  Government  of  the 
United States was bound to provide to noncitizen inhabitants 
"guaranties  of  certain  fundamental  personal  rights  declared 
in  the  Constitution."  258  U. S.,  at  312;  see  also  Late  Corp.

Opinion of the Court 
noting the inherent practical difficulties of enforcing all con-stitutional  provisions  "always  and  everywhere," 

Balzac, 
supra,  at 312, the  Court devised in  the  Insular Cases a  doc-trine that allowed it to use its power sparingly and where it 

would  be  most  needed.  This  century-old  doctrine  informs our analysis in the present matter. 

Practical  considerations  likewise  influenced  the  Court's analysis 

a  half  century  later in  Reid,  354  U. S. 1.  The  peti-tioners  there,  spouses  of  American  servicemen,  lived  on 

American military bases in England and Japan.  They were charged with  crimes committed in  those countries  and tried 
before military courts, consistent with executive agreements 
the United States had entered into with the British and Jap-
anese  Governments.  Id.,  at  15-16,  and  nn.  29-30  (plurality 
opinion).  Because the petitioners were not themselves mili-
tary  personnel,  they  argued  they  were  entitled  to  trial  by 
jury. 

Justice  Black,  writing  for  the  plurality,  contrasted  the 
cases before him with the Insular Cases, which involved ter-
ritories  "with  wholly  dissimilar  traditions  and  institutions" 
that  Congress  intended  to  govern  only  "temporarily."  Id., 
at 14.  Justice Frankfurter argued that the "specific circum-
stances  of  each  particular  case" are  relevant  in  determining 
the geographic scope of the Constitution.  Id., at 54 (opinion 
concurring  in  result).  And  Justice  Harlan,  who  had  joined 
an  opinion  reaching  the  opposite  result  in  the  case  in  the 
previous Term, Reid v.  Covert, 351 U. S. 487 (1956), was most 
explicit  in  rejecting  a  "rigid  and  abstract  rule"  for  deter-
mining  where  constitutional  guarantees  extend.  Reid,  354 
U. S., at 74 (opinion concurring in result).  He read the Insu-
lar  Cases  to  teach  that  whether  a  constitutional  provision 
has  extraterritorial  effect  depends  upon  the  "particular  cir-
cumstances,  the  practical necessities,  and the  possible  alter-
natives  which  Congress  had  before  it"  and,  in  particular, 
whether judicial enforcement of the provision would be "im-
practicable  and  anomalous."  Id.,  at  74-75;  see  also  United

Ross 
as  holding  that  "constitutional  protections  applied  `only  to citizens  and  others  within  the  United  States . . .  and  not  to  

residents  or  temporary  sojourners  abroad' "  (quoting  Ross, 
supra,  at  464));  354  U. S.,  at  64  (Frankfurter,  J.,  concurring 
in  result)  (noting  that  the  consular  tribunals  upheld  in  Ross 
"w[ere] based on long-established custom and they were jus-tified  as  the  best  possible  means  for  securing  justice  for  the 

few  Americans  present  in  [foreign]  countries");  354  U. S.,  at 75  (Harlan,  J.,  concurring  in  result)  ("[W]hat 

Ross  and  the 
Insular  Cases  hold  is  that  the  particular  local  setting,  the 
practical  necessities,  and  the  possible  alternatives  are  rele-
vant  to  a  question  of  judgment,  namely,  whether  jury  trial 
should  be  deemed  a  necessary  condition  of  the  exercise 
of  Congress'  power  to  provide  for  the  trial  of  Americans 
overseas"). 

The Reid plurality doubted that Ross was rightly decided, 
precisely  because  it  believed  the  opinion  was  insufficiently 
protective of the rights of American citizens.  See 354 U. S., 
at 10-12; see also id., at 78 (Clark, J., dissenting) (noting that 
"four  of  my  brothers  would  specifically  overrule  and  two 
would  impair  the  long-recognized  vitality  of  an  old  and  re-
spected precedent in our law, the case of In re Ross, 140 U. S. 
453  (1891)").  But  Justices  Harlan  and  Frankfurter,  while 
willing  to  hold  that  the  American  citizen  petitioners  in  the 
cases  before  them  were  entitled  to  the  protections  of  Fifth 
and  Sixth  Amendments,  were  unwilling  to  overturn  Ross. 
354  U. S., at 64 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result);  id., at

curring  Justices  distinguished  Ross  from  the  cases  before 
them,  not  on  the  basis  of  the  citizenship  of  the  petitioners, 
but  on  practical  considerations  that  made  jury  trial  a  more 
feasible  option  for  them  than  it  was  for  the  petitioner  in 
Ross.  If citizenship had been the only relevant factor in the 
case, it would have been necessary for the Court to overturn

ther determinations, based on practical considerations, were 
integral to Part II of its opinion and came before the decision 
announced its holding.  See 339 U. S., at 781. 

Second,  because  the  United  States  lacked  both  de  jure 
sovereignty and plenary  control over  Landsberg Prison,  see 
infra,  at 768, it  is far from  clear that the  Eisentrager Court 
used the term sovereignty only in the narrow technical sense 
and not to connote the degree of control the military asserted 
over the facility.  See supra, at 751-752.  The Justices who 
decided  Eisentrager  would  have  understood  sovereignty  as 
a  multifaceted  concept.  See  Black's  Law  Dictionary  1568 
(4th  ed.  1951)  (defining  "sovereignty"  as  "[t]he  supreme,  ab-
solute,  and  uncontrollable  power  by  which  any  independent 
state  is  governed";  "the  international  independence  of  a 
state,  combined  with  the  right  and  power  of  regulating  its 
internal  affairs  without  foreign  dictation";  and  "[t]he  power 
to  do  everything  in  a state  without  accountability");  Ballen-
tine's Law Dictionary With Pronunciations 1216 (2d ed. 1948) 
(defining  "sovereignty"  as  "[t]hat  public  authority  which 
commands  in  civil  society,  and  orders  and  directs  what  each 
citizen is to perform to obtain the end of its institution").  In 
its principal brief in Eisentrager, the Government advocated 
a bright-line test for determining the scope of the writ, simi-
lar to the one it advocates in these cases.  See Brief for Peti-
tioners  in  Johnson  v.  Eisentrager,  O.  T.  1949,  No.  306, 
pp.  74-75.  Yet  the  Court  mentioned  the  concept  of  territo-
rial sovereignty only twice  in its opinion.  See  Eisentrager, 
supra, at 778, 780.  That the Court devoted a significant por-
tion  of  Part  II  to  a  discussion  of  practical  barriers  to  the 
running  of  the  writ  suggests  that  the  Court  was  not  con-
cerned exclusively with the formal legal status of Landsberg 
Prison  but  also  with  the  objective  degree  of  control  the 
United  States  asserted  over  it.  Even  if  we  assume  the 
Eisentrager Court considered the United States' lack of for-
mal legal sovereignty over Landsberg Prison as the decisive

Opinion of the Court 
factor in that case, its holding is not inconsistent with a func-tional approach to questions of extraterritoriality.  The for-

mal legal status of a given territory affects, at least to some extent,  the  political  branches'  control  over  that  territory. 
De jure sovereignty is a factor that bears upon which consti-tutional guarantees apply there. 

Third,  if  the  Government's  reading  of  Eisentrager  were correct, the opinion would have marked not only a change in, 
but  a  complete  repudiation  of,  the  Insular  Cases'  (and  later 
Reid's)  functional  approach  to  questions  of  extraterritorial-ity.  We  cannot  accept  the  Government's  view.  Nothing  in 

Eisentrager says that de jure sovereignty is or has ever been the  only  relevant  consideration  in  determining  the  geo-
graphic reach of the Constitution or of habeas corpus.  Were that  the  case,  there  would  be  considerable  tension  between 
Eisentrager,  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  Insular  Cases  and 
Reid,  on  the  other.  Our  cases  need  not  be  read  to  conflict in  this  manner.  A  constricted reading  of Eisentrager over-

looks  what  we  see  as  a  common  thread  uniting  the  Insular Cases,  Eisentrager,  and  Reid:  the  idea  that  questions  of  ex-
traterritoriality  turn  on  objective  factors  and  practical  con-cerns, not formalism. 

B 
The  Government's  formal  sovereignty-based  test  raises troubling separation-of-powers concerns as well.  The politi-

cal  history of  Guantanamo  illustrates  the  deficiencies  of this approach.  The  United  States  has  maintained  complete  and 
uninterrupted control of the bay for over 100 years.  At the close of the Spanish-American War, Spain ceded control over 
the entire island of Cuba to the United States and specifically "relinquishe[d] all claim[s] of sovereignty . . . and title."  See 
Treaty  of  Paris,  Dec.  10,  1898,  U.  S.-Spain,  Art.  I,  30  Stat. 1755,  T.  S.  No.  343.  From  the  date  the  treaty  with  Spain 
was signed until the Cuban Republic was established on May 20, 1902, the United States governed the territory "in trust" 
for  the  benefit  of  the  Cuban  people.  Neely  v.  Henkel,  180

Opinion of the Court 
U. S.  109,  120  (1901);  H.  Thomas,  Cuba  or  The  Pursuit  of Freedom  436,  460  (1998).  And  although  it  recognized,  by 

entering into the 1903 Lease Agreement, that Cuba retained "ultimate sovereignty" over  Guantanamo, the  United States 
continued  to  maintain  the  same  plenary  control  it  had  en-joyed  since  1898.  Yet  the  Government's  view  is  that  the 
Constitution  had  no  effect  there,  at  least  as  to  noncitizens, 
because the United States disclaimed sovereignty in the for-mal sense of the term.  The necessary implication of the ar-

gument is that by surrendering formal sovereignty over any unincorporated  territory  to  a  third  party,  while  at the  same 
time  entering  into  a  lease  that  grants  total  control  over  the 
territory  back  to the  United  States,  it  would be  possible for 
the political branches to govern without legal constraint. 

Our  basic  charter  cannot  be  contracted  away  like  this. 
The  Constitution  grants  Congress  and  the  President  the 
power  to  acquire,  dispose  of,  and  govern  territory,  not  the 
power  to  decide  when  and  where  its  terms  apply.  Even 
when  the  United  States  acts  outside  its  borders,  its  powers 
are  not  "absolute  and  unlimited"  but  are  subject  "to  such 
restrictions as are expressed in the Constitution."  Murphy 
v.  Ramsey,  114  U. S.  15,  44  (1885).  Abstaining  from  ques-
tions  involving  formal  sovereignty  and  territorial  gover-
nance  is  one  thing.  To  hold  the  political  branches  have  the 
power  to  switch  the  Constitution  on  or  off  at  will  is  quite 
another.  The  former  position  reflects  this  Court's  recogni-
tion  that  certain  matters  requiring  political  judgments  are 
best left to the  political  branches.  The latter  would permit 
a  striking  anomaly  in  our  tripartite  system  of  government, 
leading to a regime in which Congress and the President, not 
this  Court,  say  "what  the  law  is."  Marbury  v.  Madison,  1 
Cranch 137, 177 (1803). 

These  concerns  have  particular  bearing  upon  the  Suspen-
sion Clause question in the cases now before us, for the writ 
of  habeas  corpus  is  itself  an  indispensable  mechanism  for 
monitoring  the  separation  of  powers.  The  test  for  deter-

in  CSRT  proceedings  to  determine  their  status;  but,  unlike in 

Eisentrager, supra, at 766, there has been no trial by mili-
tary  commission  for  violations  of  the  laws  of  war.  The  dif-ference  is  not  trivial.  The  records  from  the 

Eisentrager 
trials suggest that, well before the petitioners brought their case  to  this  Court,  there  had  been  a  rigorous  adversarial 

process  to  test  the  legality  of  their  detention.  The  Eisen-
trager  petitioners  were  charged  by  a  bill  of  particulars  that made  detailed  factual  allegations  against  them.  See  14 

United  Nations  War  Crimes  Commission,  Law  Reports  of Trials of War Criminals 8-10 (1949) (reprint 1997).  To rebut 
the  accusations,  they  were  entitled  to  representation  by 
counsel,  allowed  to  introduce  evidence  on  their  own  behalf, 
and permitted to cross-examine  the prosecution's witnesses. 
See Memorandum by Command of Lt. Gen. Wedemeyer, Jan. 
21,  1946  (establishing  "Regulations  Governing  the  Trial  of 
War  Criminals"  in  the  China  Theater),  in  Tr.  of  Record  in 
Johnson v.  Eisentrager, O. T. 1949, No. 306, pp. 34-40. 

In  comparison  the  procedural  protections  afforded  to  the 
detainees  in  the  CSRT  hearings  are  far  more  limited,  and, 
we conclude, fall well short of the procedures and adversarial 
mechanisms that would eliminate the need for habeas corpus 
review.  Although the detainee is assigned a "Personal Rep-
resentative"  to  assist  him  during  CSRT  proceedings,  the 
Secretary  of the Navy's memorandum makes  clear that per-
son is not the detainee's lawyer or even his "advocate."  See 
App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 06-1196, at 155, ||F(1), 172.  The 
Government's evidence is accorded a presumption of validity. 
Id.,  at  159.  The  detainee  is  allowed  to  present  "reasonably 
available" evidence, id., at 155, ||F(1), but his ability to rebut 
the Government's evidence against him is limited by the cir-
cumstances of his confinement and his lack of counsel at this 
stage.  And  although  the  detainee  can  seek  review  of  his 
status  determination  in  the  Court  of  Appeals,  that  review 
process  cannot  cure  all  defects  in  the  earlier  proceedings.

Opinion of the Court 
As  to  the  second  factor  relevant  to  this  analysis,  the  de-tainees  here  are  similarly  situated  to  the 

Eisentrager  peti-
tioners  in  that the  sites  of their  apprehension  and detention are technically outside the sovereign territory of the United 

States.  As noted earlier, this is a factor that weighs against finding  they have rights under  the Suspension Clause.  But 
there  are  critical  differences  between  Landsberg  Prison, 
circa  1950,  and  the  United  States  Naval  Station  at  Guan-tanamo  Bay  in  2008.  Unlike  its  present  control  over  the 

naval  station,  the  United  States'  control  over  the  prison  in Germany was neither absolute nor indefinite.  Like all parts 
of  occupied  Germany,  the  prison  was  under  the  jurisdic-
tion  of  the  combined  Allied  Forces.  See  Declaration  Re-
garding  the  Defeat  of  Germany  and  the  Assumption  of  Su-
preme  Authority  with  Respect  to  Germany,  June  5,  1945, 
U. S.-U. S. S. R.-U. K.-Fr.,  60  Stat.  1649,  T. I. A. S.  No.  1520. 
The United States was therefore answerable to its Allies for 
all activities occurring there.  Cf. Hirota v.  MacArthur, 338 
U. S. 197, 198 (1948) (per curiam) (military tribunal set up by 
Gen.  Douglas  MacArthur,  acting  as  "the  agent  of  the  Allied 
Powers,"  was  not  a  "tribunal  of  the  United  States").  The 
Allies  had  not  planned  a  long-term  occupation  of  Germany, 
nor  did  they  intend  to  displace  all  German  institutions  even 
during the period of occupation.  See Agreements Respect-
ing  Basic  Principles  for  Merger  of  the  Three  Western  Ger-
man  Zones  of  Occupation,  and  Other  Matters,  Apr.  8,  1949, 
U. S.-U. K.-Fr., Art. 1,  63 Stat. 2819, T. I. A. S. No. 2066  (es-
tablishing  a  governing  framework  "[d]uring  the  period  in 
which  it  is  necessary  that  the  occupation  continue"  and  ex-
pressing  the  desire  "that  the  German  people  shall  enjoy 
self-government  to the  maximum  possible degree  consistent 
with such occupation").  The Court's holding in Eisentrager 
was thus consistent with the Insular Cases, where it had held 
there  was  no  need  to  extend  full  constitutional  protections 
to territories  the United States  did  not intend to govern  in-
definitely.  Guantanamo  Bay,  on  the  other  hand,  is  no  tran-

Court  was  right  to  be  concerned  about  judicial  interference with the military's efforts to contain "enemy elements, guer-

rilla fighters, and `werewolves.' "  339 U. S., at 784. Similar  threats  are  not  apparent  here;  nor  does  the  Gov-
ernment  argue  that  they  are.  The  United  States  Naval Station  at  Guantanamo  Bay  consists  of  45  square  miles  of 
land and water.  The base  has  been used,  at various  points, 
to  house  migrants  and  refugees  temporarily.  At  present, however,  other  than  the  detainees  themselves,  the  only 

long-term  residents  are  American  military  personnel,  their families,  and  a  small  number  of  workers.  See  History  of 
Guantanamo  Bay,  online  at  https://www.cnic.navy.mil/ 

Guantanamo/AboutGTMO/gtmohistgeneral/gtmohistgeneral. 
The  detainees  have  been  deemed  enemies  of  the  United 
States.  At  present,  dangerous  as  they  may  be  if  released, 
they  are  contained  in  a  secure  prison  facility  located  on  an 
isolated and heavily fortified military base. 

There is no indication, furthermore, that adjudicating a ha-
beas corpus petition would cause friction with  the host gov-
ernment.  No  Cuban  court  has  jurisdiction  over  American 
military personnel at Guantanamo or the enemy combatants 
detained  there.  While  obligated  to  abide  by  the  terms  of 
the  lease,  the  United  States  is,  for  all  practical  purposes, 
answerable  to  no  other  sovereign  for  its  acts  on  the  base. 
Were  that  not  the  case,  or  if  the  detention  facility  were  lo-
cated in an active theater of war, arguments that issuing the 
writ  would  be  "impracticable  or  anomalous"  would  have 
more weight.  See Reid, 354 U. S., at 74 (Harlan, J., concur-
ring  in  result).  Under  the  facts  presented  here,  however, 
there  are  few  practical  barriers  to  the  running  of  the  writ. 
To the extent barriers arise, habeas corpus procedures likely 
can be modified to address them.  See Part VI-B, infra. 

It is  true that  before today the  Court has  never held  that 
noncitizens  detained  by  our  Government  in  territory  over 
which  another  country  maintains  de  jure  sovereignty  have 
any rights under our  Constitution.  But the  cases before us

lack  any  precise  historical  parallel.  They  involve  individu-als detained by executive order for the duration of a conflict 

that, if measured from September 11, 2001, to the present, is already  among  the  longest  wars  in  American  history.  See 
Oxford Companion to American Military History 849 (1999). The  detainees,  moreover,  are  held  in  a  territory  that,  while 
technically  not  part  of  the  United  States,  is  under  the  com-plete and total control of our Government.  Under these cir-
cumstances  the  lack  of  a  precedent  on  point  is  no  barrier  to our holding. 

We  hold  that  Art.  I,  $ 9,  cl.  2,  of  the  Constitution  has  full effect at Guantanamo Bay.  If the privilege of habeas corpus 
is  to  be  denied  to  the  detainees  now  before  us,  Congress must act in accordance with the requirements of the Suspen-
sion  Clause.  Cf.  Hamdi,  542  U. S.,  at  564  (Scalia,

Opinion of the Court 
Court  of  Appeals,  see  DTA  $ 1005(e),  provides  an  adequate substitute.  Congress  has  granted  that  court  jurisdiction  to 

consider 

"(i)  whether the status determination of the [CSRT] . . . 
was consistent with the standards and procedures speci-fied by the Secretary of Defense . . . and (ii) to the extent 

the Constitution and laws of the United States are appli-cable, whether the use of such standards and procedures 
to make the determination is consistent with the Consti-tution  and  laws  of  the  United  States."  $ 1005(e)(2)(C), 
119 Stat. 2742. 
The  Court  of  Appeals,  having  decided  that  the  writ  does 
not  run  to  the  detainees  in  any  event,  found  it  unnecessary to  consider  whether  an  adequate  substitute  has  been  pro-

vided.  In  the  ordinary  course  we  would  remand  to  the Court  of  Appeals  to  consider  this  question  in  the  first  in-
stance.  See  Youakim  v.  Miller,  425  U. S.  231,  234  (1976) 
(per  curiam).  It  is  well  settled,  however,  that  the  Court's 
practice of declining to address issues left unresolved in ear-
lier  proceedings  is  not  an  inflexible  rule.  Ibid.  Departure 
from  the  rule  is  appropriate  in  "exceptional"  circumstances. 
See Cooper Industries, Inc. v.  Aviall Services, Inc., 543 U. S. 
157,  169  (2004);  Duignan  v.  United  States,  274  U. S.  195, 
200 (1927). 

The  gravity  of  the  separation-of-powers  issues  raised  by 
these  cases  and  the  fact  that  these  detainees  have  been  de-
nied  meaningful  access  to  a  judicial  forum  for  a  period  of 
years render these cases exceptional.  The parties before us 
have  addressed  the  adequacy  issue.  While  we  would  have 
found  it  informative  to  consider  the  reasoning  of  the  Court 
of  Appeals  on  this  point,  we  must  weigh  that  against  the 
harms  petitioners  may  endure  from  additional  delay.  And, 
given there are few precedents addressing what features an

likelihood  a  remand  simply  would  delay  ultimate  resolution of the issue by this Court. 

We  do have  the benefit of the  Court of Appeals' construc-tion of key provisions of the DTA.  When we granted certio-
rari in these cases, we noted "it would be of material assist-ance  to  consult  any  decision"  in  the  parallel  DTA  review 
proceedings pending in the Court of Appeals, specifically any rulings in the matter of 

Bismullah v.  Gates.  551 U. S. 1160 (2007).  Although  the  Court  of Appeals  has  yet  to complete 

a  DTA  review  proceeding,  the  three-judge  panel  in  Bismul-lah  has  issued  an  interim  order  giving  guidance  as  to  what 
evidence can be made part of the record on review and what access  the  detainees  can  have  to  counsel  and  to  classified 
information.  See 501 F. 3d 178 (CADC) (Bismullah I), reh'g denied, 503 F. 3d 137 (CADC 2007) 

(Bismullah II).  In that matter  the  full  court  denied  the  Government's  motion  for 

rehearing  en  banc,  see  Bismullah  v.  Gates,  514  F.  3d  1291 (CADC  2008)  (Bismullah  III).  The  order  denying  rehear-
ing was accompanied by five separate statements from mem-bers of the court, which offer differing views as to the scope 
of  the  judicial  review  Congress  intended  these  detainees  to have. 

Ibid. Under  the  circumstances  we  believe  the  costs  of  further 

delay  substantially  outweigh  any  benefits  of  remanding  to the Court of Appeals to consider the issue it did not address 
in these cases. 

A 

Our  case  law  does  not  contain  extensive  discussion  of 
standards defining suspension of the writ or of circumstances under which suspension has occurred.  This simply confirms 

the care Congress has taken throughout our Nation's history to  preserve  the  writ  and  its  function.  Indeed,  most  of  the 
major  legislative  enactments  pertaining  to  habeas  corpus have  acted  not  to  contract  the  writ's  protection  but  to  ex-
pand  it  or  to  hasten  resolution  of  prisoners'  claims.  See,

Opinion of the Court 
e. g., Habeas Corpus Act of 1867, ch. 28, $ 1, 14 Stat. 385 (cur-rent version codified at 28 U. S. C. $ 2241 (2000 ed. and Supp. 

V)  (extending  the  federal  writ  to  state  prisoners));  Cf.  Har-
ris v.  Nelson,  394 U. S. 286, 299-300 (1969) (interpreting the 
All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1651, to allow discovery in habeas corpus  proceedings); 

Peyton  v.  Rowe,  391  U. S.  54,  64-65 
(1968)  (interpreting  the  then-existing  version  of  $ 2241  to 
allow  petitioner  to  proceed  with  his  habeas  corpus  action, even though he had not yet begun to serve his sentence). 

There are exceptions, of course.  Title I of the Antiterror-ism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), $ 106, 
110  Stat.  1220,  contains  certain  gatekeeping  provisions  that 
restrict  a  prisoner's  ability  to  bring  new  and  repetitive 
claims in "second or successive" habeas corpus actions.  We 
upheld  these  provisions  against  a  Suspension  Clause  chal-
lenge  in  Felker  v.  Turpin,  518  U. S.  651,  662-664  (1996). 
The provisions at issue in Felker, however, did not constitute 
a  substantial  departure  from  common-law  habeas  proce-
dures.  The  provisions,  for  the  most  part,  codified  the  long-
standing  abuse-of-the-writ  doctrine.  Id.,  at  664;  see  also 
McCleskey  v.  Zant,  499  U. S.  467,  489  (1991).  AEDPA  ap-
plies, moreover, to federal, postconviction review after crimi-
nal  proceedings  in  state  court  have  taken  place.  As  of this 
point,  cases  discussing  the  implementation  of  that  statute 
give  little  helpful  instruction  (save  perhaps  by  contrast)  for 
the instant cases, where no trial has been held. 

The  two  leading  cases  addressing  habeas  substitutes, 
Swain v.  Pressley, 430 U. S. 372 (1977),  and United States v. 
Hayman,  342  U. S.  205  (1952),  likewise  provide  little  guid-
ance  here.  The  statutes  at  issue  were  attempts  to  stream-
line habeas corpus relief, not to cut it back. 

The  statute  discussed  in  Hayman  was  28  U. S. C.  $ 2255. 
It  replaced  traditional  habeas  corpus  for  federal  prisoners 
(at least in the first instance) with a process that allowed the 
prisoner  to  file  a  motion  with  the  sentencing  court  on  the 
ground that his sentence was, inter alia, " `imposed in viola-

Opinion of the Court 
tion of the Constitution or laws of the United States.' "  342 U. S., at 207, n. 1.  The purpose and effect of the statute was 

not to restrict access to the writ but to make postconviction proceedings  more  efficient.  It  directed  claims  not  to  the 
court  that  had  territorial  jurisdiction  over  the  place  of  the petitioner's confinement but to the sentencing court, a court 
already familiar with the facts of the case.  As the Hayman 
Court explained: 

"Section 2255 . . . was passed at the instance of the Judi-cial  Conference  to  meet  practical  difficulties  that  had 

arisen in administering the habeas corpus jurisdiction of 
the  federal  courts.  Nowhere  in  the  history  of  Section 2255 do we find any purpose to impinge upon prisoners' 

rights  of  collateral  attack  upon  their  convictions.  On the contrary, the sole purpose was to minimize the diffi-
culties encountered in habeas corpus hearings by afford-ing  the  same  rights  in  another  and  more  convenient 
forum."  Id., at 219. 
See  also  Hill  v.  United  States,  368  U. S.  424,  427,  428,  and n. 5 (1962)  (noting that $ 2255 provides a remedy  in  the  sen-

tencing  court  that  is  "exactly  commensurate"  with  the  pre-
existing federal habeas corpus remedy). The  statute  in 

Swain,  D.  C.  Code  Ann.  $ 23-110(g)  (1973), 
applied  to  prisoners  in  custody  under  sentence  of  the  Supe-rior Court of the District of Columbia.  Before enactment of 

the  District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Proce-dure  Act  of  1970  (D.  C.  Court  Reform  Act),  84  Stat.  473, 
those  prisoners  could  file  habeas  petitions  in  the  United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  The Act, 
which  was  patterned  on  $ 2255,  substituted  a  new  collateral 
process  in  the  Superior  Court  for  the  pre-existing  habeas 
corpus  procedure  in  the  District  Court.  See  Swain,  430 
U. S.,  at  374-378.  But,  again,  the  purpose  and  effect  of  the 
statute  was  to  expedite  consideration  of  the  prisoner's 
claims, not to delay or frustrate it.  See id., at 375, n. 4 (not-

ing  that  the  purpose  of  the  D.  C.  Court  Reform  Act  was  to "alleviate" administrative burdens on the District Court). 

That  the  statutes  in  Hayman  and  Swain  were  designed to  strengthen, rather  than  dilute,  the  writ's  protections  was 
evident, furthermore, from this significant fact: Neither stat-ute  eliminated  traditional  habeas  corpus  relief.  In  both 
cases the statute at issue had a saving clause, providing that 
a writ of habeas corpus would be available if the alternative process  proved  inadequate  or  ineffective. 

Swain,  supra,  at 
381; Hayman, supra, at 223.  The Court placed explicit reli-ance upon these provisions in upholding the statutes against 

constitutional  challenges.  See  Swain,  supra,  at 381  (noting 
that the  provision "avoid[ed] any serious  question about  the 
constitutionality  of  the  statute");  Hayman,  supra,  at  223 
(noting that, because habeas remained available as a last re-
sort, it was unnecessary to "reach constitutional questions"). 

Unlike  in  Hayman  and  Swain,  here  we  confront  statutes, 
the  DTA  and  the  MCA,  that  were  intended  to  circumscribe 
habeas  review.  Congress'  purpose  is  evident  not  only  from 
the  unequivocal  nature  of  MCA  $ 7's  jurisdiction-stripping 
language,  28  U. S. C.  $ 2241(e)(1)  ("No  court,  justice,  or 
judge  shall  have  jurisdiction  to  hear  or  consider  an  applica-
tion for  a  writ  of  habeas corpus .  . . "),  but also  from  a  com-
parison  of  the  DTA  to  the  statutes  at  issue  in  Hayman  and 
Swain.  When  interpreting  a  statute,  we  examine  related 
provisions  in  other  parts  of  the  U.  S.  Code.  See,  e. g.,  West 
Virginia  Univ.  Hospitals,  Inc.  v.  Casey,  499  U. S.  83,  88-97 
(1991);  Babbitt  v.  Sweet  Home  Chapter,  Communities  for 
Great Ore., 515 U. S. 687, 717-718 (1995) (Scalia,

context, for example, Congress has granted to the reviewing court  power  to  "determine  the  issues  and  make  findings  of 

fact  and  conclusions  of  law"  with  respect  to  whether  "the judgment  [of  conviction]  was  rendered  without  jurisdic-
tion,  or . . .  the  sentence  imposed  was  not  authorized  by law  or  otherwise  open  to  collateral  attack."  28  U. S. C. 

$ 2255(b) (2006  ed., Supp. II).  The D. C. Court Reform Act, 
the  statute  upheld  in  Swain,  contained  a  similar  provision. $ 23-110(g), 84 Stat. 609. 

In contrast the DTA's jurisdictional grant is quite limited. The Court of Appeals has jurisdiction not to inquire into the 
legality of the detention generally but only to assess whether 
the  CSRT  complied  with  the  "standards  and  procedures 
specified  by  the  Secretary  of  Defense"  and  whether  those 
standards  and  procedures  are  lawful.  DTA  $ 1005(e)(2)(C), 
119  Stat.  2742.  If  Congress  had  envisioned  DTA  review  as 
coextensive with traditional habeas corpus, it would not have 
drafted  the  statute  in  this  manner.  Instead,  it  would  have 
used language similar to what it used in the statutes at issue 
in  Hayman  and  Swain.  Cf.  Russello  v.  United  States,  464 
U. S.  16,  23  (1983)  (" `[W]here  Congress  includes  particular 
language  in  one  section  of  a  statute  but  omits  it  in  another 
section  of  the  same  Act,  it  is  generally  presumed  that  Con-
gress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclu-
sion  or  exclusion' "  (quoting  United  States  v.  Wong  Kim  Bo, 
472  F.  2d  720,  722  (CA5  1972)  (per  curiam))).  Unlike  in 
Hayman  and  Swain,  moreover,  there  has  been  no  effort  to 
preserve  habeas  corpus  review  as  an  avenue  of  last  resort. 
No saving clause exists in either the MCA or the DTA.  And 
MCA $ 7 eliminates habeas review for these petitioners. 

The  differences  between  the  DTA  and  the  habeas  statute 
that  would  govern  in  MCA  $ 7's  absence,  28  U. S. C.  $ 2241 
(2000 ed. and Supp. V), are likewise telling.  In $ 2241 (2000 
ed.)  Congress  confirmed  the  authority  of  "any  justice"  or 
"circuit  judge"  to  issue  the  writ.  Cf.  Felker,  518  U. S.,  at 
660-661  (interpreting  Title  I  of  AEDPA  to  not  strip  from

Opinion of the Court 
this Court the power to entertain original habeas corpus pe-titions).  That  statute  accommodates  the  necessity  for  fact-

finding that will arise in some cases by allowing the appellate judge  or  Justice  to  transfer  the  case  to  a  district  court  of 
competent jurisdiction, whose institutional capacity for fact-finding  is  superior  to  his  or  her  own.  See  28  U. S. C. 

$ 2241(b).  By granting the Court of Appeals "exclusive" ju-
risdiction  over  petitioners'  cases,  see  DTA  $ 1005(e)(2)(A), 119  Stat.  2742,  Congress  has  foreclosed  that  option.  This 

choice  indicates  Congress  intended  the  Court  of  Appeals  to have a more limited role in enemy combatant status determi-
nations  than  a  district  court  has  in  habeas  corpus  proceed-
ings.  The  DTA  should  be  interpreted  to  accord  some  lati-
tude to the Court of Appeals to fashion procedures necessary 
to  make  its  review  function  a  meaningful  one,  but,  if  con-
gressional  intent is  to  be  respected,  the  procedures  adopted 
cannot  be  as  extensive  or  as  protective  of  the  rights  of  the 
detainees  as  they  would  be  in  a  $ 2241  proceeding.  Other-
wise  there  would  have  been  no,  or  very  little,  purpose  for 
enacting the DTA. 

To  the  extent  any  doubt  remains  about  Congress'  intent, 
the  legislative  history confirms what  the  plain  text strongly 
suggests:  In  passing  the  DTA  Congress  did  not  intend  to 
create  a  process  that  differs  from  traditional  habeas  corpus 
process  in  name  only.  It  intended  to  create  a  more  limited 
procedure.  See,  e. g., 151  Cong. Rec.  S14263  (Dec.  21, 2005) 
(statement  of  Sen.  Graham)  (noting  that  the  DTA  "extin-
guish[es]  these  habeas  and  other  actions  in  order  to  effect  a 
transfer  of  jurisdiction  over  these  cases  to  the  DC  Circuit 
Court");  ibid. (statement of Sen.  Kyl) (agreeing  that the  bill 
"create[s] in their place a very limited judicial review of cer-
tain military administrative decisions"); id., at S14268 (same) 
("It is  important to note  that  the limited  judicial  review au-
thorized  by  paragraphs  2  and  3  of  subsection  (e)  [of  DTA 

$ 1005] are not habeas-corpus review.  It is a limited judicial 
review of its own nature").

Opinion of the Court 
It  is  against  this  background  that  we  must  interpret  the DTA  and assess its  adequacy as a substitute for  habeas cor-

pus.  The  present  cases  thus  test  the  limits  of  the  Suspen-sion Clause in ways that Hayman and Swain did not. 

B 
We do not endeavor  to offer  a comprehensive summary  of the  requisites  for  an  adequate  substitute  for  habeas  corpus. 

We  do  consider  it  uncontroversial,  however,  that  the  privi-lege  of  habeas  corpus  entitles  the  prisoner  to  a  meaningful 
opportunity to demonstrate that he is being held pursuant to "the erroneous application or interpretation" of relevant law. 
St.  Cyr,  533  U. S.,  at  302.  And  the  habeas  court  must  have the  power  to  order  the  conditional  release  of  an  individual 
unlawfully  detained--though  release  need  not  be  the  exclu-sive  remedy  and  is  not  the  appropriate  one  in  every  case  in 
which the writ is granted.  See Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75,  136  (1807)  (where  imprisonment  is  unlawful,  the  court 
"can  only  direct  [the  prisoner]  to  be  discharged");  R.  Hurd, Treatise  on  the  Right  of  Personal  Liberty,  and  On  the  Writ 
of Habeas Corpus and the Practice Connected With It: With a  View  of  the  Law  of  Extradition  of  Fugitives  222  (2d  ed. 
1876)  ("It  cannot  be  denied  where  `a  probable  ground  is shown  that  the  party  is  imprisoned  without  just  cause,  and 
therefore,  hath  a  right  to  be  delivered,'  for  the  writ  then becomes a `writ of right, which may not be denied but ought 
to  be  granted  to  every  man  that  is  committed  or  detained in  prison  or  otherwise  restrained  of  his  liberty' ").  But  see 
Chessman v.  Teets,  354 U. S. 156, 165-166 (1957) (remanding in  a  habeas  case  for  retrial  within  a  "reasonable  time"). 
These are the easily identified attributes of any constitution-ally adequate habeas corpus proceeding.  But, depending on 
the circumstances, more may be required. Indeed,  common-law  habeas  corpus  was,  above  all,  an 
adaptable  remedy.  Its  precise  application  and  scope changed  depending  upon  the  circumstances.  See  3  Black-

return may be gone into to ascertain whether the committing 
magistrate  may  not  have  arrived  at  an  illogical  conclusion 
upon the  evidence  given before  him  . . . ");  see generally W. 
Church, Treatise on the Writ of Habeas Corpus $ 182, p. 235 
1886) (hereinafter Church) (noting that  habeas courts would 
"hear evidence anew if justice require it").  Justice McLean, 
on  Circuit  in  1855,  expressed  his  view  that  a  habeas  court 
should  consider  a  prior  judgment  conclusive  "where  there 
was  clearly  jurisdiction  and  a  full  and  fair  hearing;  but  that 
it  might  not  be  so  considered  when  any  of  these  requisites 
were  wanting."  Ex  parte  Robinson,  20  F.  Cas.  969,  971, 
(No.  11,935)  (CC  Ohio).  To  illustrate  the  circumstances  in 
which  the  prior  adjudication  did  not  bind  the  habeas  court, 
he  gave  the  example  of  a  case  in  which  "[s]everal  unim-
peached  witnesses"  provided  new  evidence  to  exculpate  the 
prisoner.  Ibid. 

The idea that the necessary scope of habeas review in part 
depends  upon  the  rigor  of  any  earlier  proceedings  accords 
with our test for procedural adequacy in the due process con-
text.  See  Mathews  v.  Eldridge,  424  U. S.  319,  335  (1976) 
(noting that the Due Process Clause requires an  assessment 
of, inter alia, "the risk of an erroneous deprivation of [a lib-
erty  interest;]  and  the  probable  value,  if  any,  of  additional 
or substitute procedural safeguards").  This principle has an 
established  foundation  in  habeas  corpus  jurisprudence  as

Opinion of the Court 
well, as Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in Ex parte Watkins, 3  Pet.  193  (1830),  demonstrates.  Like  the  petitioner  in 

Swain,  Watkins  sought  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus  after  being imprisoned  pursuant  to  a  judgment  of  a  District  of  Colum-
bia  court.  In  holding  that  the  judgment  stood  on  "high ground,"  3  Pet.,  at  209,  the  Chief  Justice  emphasized  the 
character  of  the  court  that  rendered  the  original  judgment, 
noting  it  was  a  "court  of  record,  having  general  jurisdiction over criminal cases." 

Id.,  at 203.  In contrast to "inferior" 
tribunals  of  limited  jurisdiction,  ibid.,  courts  of  record  had broad remedial powers, which gave the habeas court greater 

confidence  in  the  judgment's  validity.  See  generally  Neu-
man, Habeas Corpus, Executive Detention, and the Removal 
of Aliens, 98 Colum. L. Rev. 961, 982-983 (1998). 

Accordingly,  where  relief  is  sought  from  a  sentence  that 
resulted  from  the  judgment  of  a  court  of  record,  as  was  the 
case  in  Watkins  and  indeed  in  most  federal  habeas  cases, 
considerable deference is owed to the court that ordered con-
finement.  See  Brown  v.  Allen,  344  U. S.  443,  506  (1953) 
(opinion  of  Frankfurter,  J.)  (noting  that  a  federal  habeas 
court  should  accept  a  state  court's  factual  findings  unless 
"a  vital  flaw  be  found  in  the  process  of  ascertaining  such 
facts in the State court").  Likewise in those cases the pris-
oner  should  exhaust  adequate  alternative  remedies  before 
filing  for  the  writ  in  federal  court.  See  Ex  parte  Royall, 
117  U. S.  241,  251-252  (1886)  (requiring  exhaustion  of  state 
collateral processes).  Both aspects of federal habeas corpus 
review  are  justified  because  it  can  be  assumed  that,  in  the 
usual  course,  a  court  of  record  provides  defendants  with  a 
fair, adversary proceeding.  In cases involving state convic-
tions this framework also respects federalism; and in federal 
cases it  has  added  justification because  the  prisoner  already 
has had a chance to seek review of his conviction in a federal 
forum  through  a  direct  appeal.  The  present  cases  fall  out-
side  these  categories,  however;  for  here  the  detention  is  by 
executive order.

Opinion of the Court 
Where  a  person  is  detained  by  executive  order,  rather than, say, after being tried and convicted in a court, the need 

for collateral review is most pressing.  A criminal conviction in  the  usual  course  occurs  after  a  judicial  hearing  before  a 
tribunal  disinterested in  the outcome and committed to pro-cedures  designed  to  ensure  its  own  independence.  These 
dynamics  are  not  inherent  in  executive  detention  orders  or 
executive  review  procedures.  In  this  context  the  need  for habeas corpus is more urgent.  The intended duration of the 

detention  and the  reasons for  it bear  upon the  precise scope of the inquiry.  Habeas corpus proceedings need  not resem-
ble a criminal trial, even when the detention is by executive 
order.  But  the  writ  must  be  effective.  The  habeas  court 
must  have  sufficient  authority  to  conduct  a  meaningful  re-
view  of  both  the  cause  for  detention  and  the  Executive's 
power to detain. 

To determine the necessary scope of habeas corpus review, 
therefore, we must assess the CSRT process, the mechanism 
through which petitioners' designation as enemy combatants 
became final.  Whether one characterizes the CSRT process 
as direct review of the Executive's battlefield determination 
that  the  detainee  is  an  enemy  combatant--as  the  parties 
have  and  as  we  do--or  as  the  first  step  in  the  collateral  re-
view  of  a  battlefield  determination  makes  no  difference  in  a 
proper  analysis  of  whether  the  procedures  Congress  put  in 
place  are  an  adequate  substitute  for  habeas  corpus.  What 
matters  is  the  sum  total  of  procedural  protections  afforded 
to the detainee at all stages, direct and collateral. 

Petitioners  identify  what  they  see  as  myriad  deficiencies 
in  the  CSRTs.  The  most  relevant  for  our  purposes  are  the 
constraints  upon  the  detainee's  ability  to  rebut  the  factual 
basis  for  the  Government's  assertion  that  he  is  an  enemy 
combatant.  As already noted, see Part IV-C, supra, at the 
CSRT  stage  the  detainee  has  limited  means  to  find  or  pre-
sent  evidence  to  challenge  the  Government's  case  against 
him.  He  does  not  have  the  assistance  of  counsel  and  may

Opinion of the Court 
not  be  aware  of  the  most  critical  allegations  that  the  Gov-
ernment  relied  upon  to  order  his  detention.  See  App.  to 
Pet.  for  Cert.  in  No.  06-1196,  at  156,  || F(8)  (noting  that 
the  detainee  can  access  only  the  "unclassified  portion  of  the 
Government Information").  The detainee can  confront wit-
nesses  that  testify  during  the  CSRT  proceedings.  Id.,  at 
144,  || g(8).  But  given  that  there  are  in  effect  no  limits  on 
the  admission  of  hearsay  evidence--the  only  requirement  is 
that  the  tribunal  deem  the  evidence  "relevant  and  helpful," 
ibid.,  || g(9)--the  detainee's  opportunity  to  question  wit-
nesses is likely to be more theoretical than real. 

The Government  defends  the CSRT process,  arguing  that 
it  was  designed  to  conform  to  the  procedures  suggested  by 
the  plurality  in  Hamdi.  See  542  U. S.,  at  538.  Setting 
aside  the  fact  that  the  relevant  language  in  Hamdi  did  not 
garner a majority of the Court, it does not control the matter 
at  hand.  None  of  the  parties  in  Hamdi  argued  there  had 
been a  suspension of the writ.  Nor could they.  The $ 2241 
habeas  corpus  process  remained  in  place,  id.,  at  525.  Ac-
cordingly, the  plurality  concentrated on  whether the  Execu-
tive  had  the  authority  to  detain  and,  if  so,  what  rights  the 
detainee  had  under  the  Due  Process  Clause.  True,  there 
are places in the Hamdi plurality opinion where it is difficult 
to  tell  where  its  extrapolation  of  $ 2241  ends  and  its  analy-
sis  of  the  petitioner's  due  process  rights  begins.  But  the 
Court  had  no  occasion  to  define  the  necessary  scope  of  ha-
beas  review,  for  Suspension  Clause  purposes,  in  the  context 
of  enemy  combatant  detentions.  The  closest  the  plurality 
came  to  doing  so  was  in  discussing  whether,  in  light  of 
separation-of-powers concerns, $ 2241 should be construed to 
prohibit  the  District  Court  from  inquiring  beyond  the  affi-
davit Hamdi's custodian provided in answer to the detainee's 
habeas petition.  The plurality answered  this  question with 
an  emphatic  "no."  Id.,  at  527  (labeling  this  argument  as 
"extreme"); id., at 535-536.

Opinion of the Court 
Even  if  we  were  to  assume  that  the  CSRTs  satisfy  due process  standards,  it  would  not  end  our  inquiry.  Habeas 

corpus  is  a  collateral  process  that  exists,  in  Justice  Holmes' words, to "cu[t] through all forms and g[o] to the very tissue 
of the structure.  It comes in from the outside, not in subor-dination  to  the  proceedings,  and  although  every  form  may 
have  been  preserved  opens  the  inquiry  whether  they  have 
been  more  than  an  empty  shell."  Frank  v.  Mangum,  237 U. S.  309,  346  (1915)  (dissenting  opinion).  Even  when  the 

procedures authorizing detention are structurally sound, the Suspension Clause remains applicable and the writ relevant. 
See  2  Chambers,  Course  of  Lectures  on  English  Law  1767- 
1773, at 6 ("Liberty may be  violated either by  arbitrary im-
prisonment  without  law  or  the  appearance  of  law,  or  by  a 
lawful  magistrate  for  an  unlawful  reason").  This  is  so,  as 
Hayman  and  Swain  make  clear,  even  where  the  prisoner  is 
detained  after  a  criminal  trial  conducted  in  full  accordance 
with the protections of the Bill of Rights.  Were this not the 
case,  there  would  have  been  no  reason  for  the  Court  to  in-
quire  into  the  adequacy  of  substitute  habeas  procedures  in 
Hayman and Swain.  That the prisoners were detained pur-
suant  to  the  most  rigorous  proceedings  imaginable,  a  full 
criminal trial, would have been enough to render any habeas 
substitute acceptable per se. 

Although  we  make  no  judgment  whether  the  CSRTs,  as 
currently  constituted,  satisfy  due  process  standards,  we 
agree  with  petitioners  that,  even  when  all  the  parties  in-
volved  in  this  process  act  with  diligence  and  in  good  faith, 
there  is  considerable  risk  of  error  in  the  tribunal's  findings 
of  fact.  This  is  a  risk  inherent  in  any  process  that,  in  the 
words of the  former Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, is 
"closed  and  accusatorial."  See  Bismullah  III,  514  F.  3d,  at 
1296  (Ginsburg,  C.  J.,  concurring  in  denial  of  rehearing  en 
banc).  And given that the consequence of error may be de-
tention of persons for the duration of hostilities that may last 
a  generation  or  more, this  is  a  risk too  significant  to ignore.

786  BOUMEDIENE  v.  BUSH 

Opinion of the Court 
For the writ of habeas corpus, or its substitute, to function as an  effective and proper  remedy  in  this  context,  the  court 

that conducts the habeas proceeding must have the means to correct  errors  that  occurred  during  the  CSRT  proceedings. 
This  includes  some authority  to assess  the  sufficiency  of the Government's  evidence  against  the  detainee.  It  also  must 
have  the  authority  to  admit  and  consider  relevant  excul-
patory  evidence  that  was  not  introduced  during  the  earlier proceeding.  Federal  habeas  petitioners  long  have  had  the 

means to supplement the record on review, even in the post-conviction  habeas setting.  See 

Townsend  v.  Sain,  372  U. S. 
293,  313  (1963),  overruled  in  part  by  Keeney  v.  TamayoReyes, 504 U. S. 1, 5 (1992).  Here that opportunity is consti-
tutionally required. 

Consistent  with  the  historic  function  and  province  of  the 
writ, habeas corpus review may be more circumscribed if the 
underlying  detention  proceedings  are  more  thorough  than 
they were here.  In two habeas cases involving enemy aliens 
tried for war crimes, In re Yamashita, 327 U. S. 1 (1946), and 
Ex  parte  Quirin,  317  U. S.  1  (1942),  for  example,  this  Court 
limited its review to determining whether the Executive had 
legal authority to try the petitioners by military commission. 
See Yamashita, supra, at 8 ("[O]n application for habeas cor-
pus  we are  not  concerned  with  the  guilt  or  innocence of  the 
petitioners.  We  consider  here  only  the  lawful  power  of  the 
commission  to  try  the  petitioner  for  the  offense  charged"); 
Quirin,  supra,  at  25  ("We  are  not  here  concerned  with  any 
question  of the  guilt or innocence of petitioners").  Military 
courts are not courts of record.  See Watkins, 3 Pet., at 209; 
Church  513.  And  the  procedures  used  to  try  General  Ya-
mashita  have  been  sharply  criticized  by  Members  of  this 
Court.  See  Hamdan,  548  U. S.,  at  617;  Yamashita,  supra, 
at  41-81  (Rutledge,  J.,  dissenting).  We  need  not  revisit 
these cases, however.  For on their own terms, the proceed-
ings in Yamashita and Quirin, like those in Eisentrager, had 
an  adversarial  structure  that  is  lacking  here.  See  Yama-

Opinion of the Court 
shita, supra, at 5 (noting that General Yamashita was repre-sented  by  six  military  lawyers  and  that  "[t]hroughout  the 

proceedings . . .  defense counsel . . . demonstrated their pro-fessional  skill  and  resourcefulness  and  their  proper  zeal  for 
the defense with which they were charged"); Quirin, supra, at 23-24; Exec.  Order No. 9185, 7  Fed. Reg. 5103 (1942) (ap-
pointing counsel to represent the German saboteurs). The extent of the  showing  required of the  Government  in 
these  cases  is  a  matter  to  be  determined.  We  need  not  ex-plore  it  further  at  this  stage.  We  do  hold  that  when  the 
judicial power to issue habeas corpus properly is invoked the judicial  officer  must  have  adequate  authority  to  make  a  de-
termination in light of the relevant law and facts and to for-mulate  and  issue  appropriate  orders  for  relief,  including,  if 
necessary, an order directing the prisoner's release. 

C 
We  now  consider  whether  the  DTA  allows  the  Court  of Appeals  to  conduct  a  proceeding  meeting  these  standards. 

"[W]e  are  obligated  to  construe  the  statute  to  avoid  [con-stitutional]  problems"  if  it  is  " `fairly  possible' "  to  do  so. 
St.  Cyr,  533  U. S.,  at  299-300  (quoting  Crowell  v.  Benson, 285  U. S.  22,  62  (1932)).  There  are  limits  to  this  principle, 
however.  The  canon  of  constitutional  avoidance  does  not supplant traditional modes of statutory interpretation.  See 
Clark  v.  Martinez,  543  U. S.  371,  385  (2005)  ("The  canon  of constitutional avoidance comes into play only when, after the 
application  of  ordinary  textual  analysis, the  statute  is  found to  be  susceptible  of  more  than  one  construction;  and  the 
canon functions as a means of choosing between them").  We cannot  ignore  the  text  and  purpose  of  a  statute  in  order  to 
save it. The  DTA  does  not  explicitly  empower  the  Court  of  Ap-
peals to order the applicant in a DTA review proceeding re-leased  should  the  court  find  that  the  standards  and  proce-
dures  used  at  his  CSRT  hearing  were  insufficient  to  justify

Opinion of the Court 
detention.  This is troubling.  Yet, for present purposes, we can  assume  congressional  silence  permits  a  constitutionally 

required  remedy.  In  that  case  it  would  be  possible  to  hold that a remedy of release is impliedly provided for.  The DTA 
might  be  read,  furthermore,  to  allow  petitioners  to  assert most,  if  not  all,  of  the  legal  claims  they  seek  to  advance, 
including  their  most  basic  claim:  that  the  President  has  no 
authority  under  the  AUMF  to  detain  them  indefinitely. (Whether the President has such authority turns on whether 

the  AUMF  authorizes--and  the  Constitution  permits--the indefinite  detention  of  "enemy  combatants"  as  the  Depart-
ment of Defense defines that term.  Thus a challenge to the 
President's  authority  to  detain  is,  in  essence,  a  challenge  to 
the  Department's  definition  of  enemy  combatant,  a  "stand-
ard" used by the CSRTs in petitioners' cases.)  At oral argu-
ment, the Solicitor General urged us to adopt both these con-
structions, if doing so would allow MCA $ 7 to remain intact. 
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37, 53. 

The  absence  of  a  release  remedy  and  specific  language 
allowing  AUMF  challenges  are  not  the  only  constitutional 
infirmities  from  which  the  statute  potentially  suffers,  how-
ever.  The  more  difficult  question  is  whether  the  DTA  per-
mits  the  Court  of  Appeals  to  make  requisite  findings  of 
fact.  The  DTA  enables  petitioners  to  request  "review"  of 
their  CSRT  determination  in  the  Court  of  Appeals,  DTA 

$ 1005(e)(2)(B)(i),  119  Stat.  2742;  but  the  "Scope  of  Review" 
provision  confines  the  Court  of  Appeals'  role  to  reviewing 
whether the CSRT followed the "standards and procedures" 
issued by the Department of Defense and assessing whether 
those "standards and procedures" are  lawful,  $ 1005(e)(2)(C), 
ibid.  Among  these  standards  is  "the  requirement  that  the 
conclusion of the Tribunal be supported  by a preponderance 
of  the  evidence  .  .  .  allowing  a  rebuttable  presumption  in 
favor of the Government's evidence."  $ 1005(e)(2)(C)(i), ibid. 

Assuming the DTA can be construed to allow the Court of 
Appeals to review or correct the CSRT's factual determina-

tions,  as  opposed  to  merely  certifying  that  the  tribunal  ap-plied  the  correct  standard  of  proof,  we  see  no  way  to  con-

strue  the  statute  to  allow  what  is  also  constitutionally required  in  this  context:  an  opportunity  for  the  detainee  to 
present  relevant  exculpatory  evidence  that  was  not  made part of the record in the earlier proceedings. 

On its face the statute allows the Court of Appeals to con-sider no 

evidence  outside the  CSRT record.  In the parallel litigation,  however,  the  Court  of  Appeals  determined  that 

the DTA allows it to order the production of all " `reasonably available  information  in  the  possession  of  the  U. S.  Govern-
ment  bearing  on  the  issue  whether  the  detainee  meets  the 
criteria  to  be  designated  as  an  enemy  combatant,' "  regard-
less  of  whether  this  evidence  was  put  before  the  CSRT. 
Bismullah  I,  501  F.  3d,  at  180.  The  Government,  see  Pet. 
for Cert. pending in Gates v.  Bismullah, No. 07-1054 (herein-
after  Bismullah  Pet.),  with  support  from  five  members  of 
the  Court  of  Appeals,  see  Bismullah  III,  514  F.  3d,  at  1299 
(Henderson, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc); 
id., at 1302 (opinion of Randolph, J.) (same); id., at 1306 (opin-
ion  of  Brown,  J.)  (same),  disagrees  with  this  interpretation. 
For  present  purposes,  however,  we  can  assume  that  the 
Court of Appeals was correct that the DTA allows introduc-
tion and consideration of relevant exculpatory  evidence that 
was "reasonably available" to the Government at the time of 
the  CSRT  but  not  made  part  of  the  record.  Even  so,  the 
DTA review proceeding falls short of being a constitutionally 
adequate substitute, for the detainee still would have no op-
portunity  to  present  evidence  discovered  after  the  CSRT 
proceedings concluded. 

Under  the  DTA  the  Court  of  Appeals  has  the  power  to 
review  CSRT  determinations  by  assessing  the  legality  of 
standards  and  procedures.  This  implies  the  power  to  in-
quire into what happened at the CSRT hearing and, perhaps, 
to  remedy  certain  deficiencies  in  that  proceeding.  But 
should  the  Court  of  Appeals  determine  that  the  CSRT  fol-

Opinion of the Court 
lowed  appropriate  and  lawful  standards  and  procedures,  it will  have  reached  the  limits  of  its  jurisdiction.  There  is  no 

language  in  the  DTA  that  can  be  construed  to  allow  the Court  of  Appeals  to  admit  and  consider  newly  discovered 
evidence  that  could  not  have  been  made  part  of  the  CSRT record  because  it  was  unavailable  to  either  the  Government 
or the detainee when the CSRT made its findings.  This evi-
dence,  however,  may  be  critical  to  the  detainee's  argument that  he  is  not  an  enemy  combatant  and  there  is  no  cause 

to detain him. This is not a remote hypothetical.  One of the petitioners, 
Mohamed  Nechla,  requested  at  his  CSRT  hearing  that  the 
Government  contact  his  employer.  Petitioner  claimed  the 
employer  would  corroborate  Nechla's  contention  he  had  no 
affiliation  with  al  Qaeda.  Although  the  CSRT  determined 
this  testimony  would  be  relevant,  it  also  found  the  witness 
was  not  reasonably  available  to  testify  at  the  time  of  the 
hearing.  Petitioner's  counsel,  however,  now  represents  the 
witness is available to be heard.  See Brief for Boumediene 
Petitioners 5.  If a detainee can present reasonably available 
evidence  demonstrating  there  is  no  basis  for  his  continued 
detention, he must have the opportunity to present this evi-
dence  to  a  habeas  corpus  court.  Even  under  the  Court  of 
Appeals' generous construction of the DTA, however, the ev-
idence  identified  by  Nechla  would  be  inadmissible  in  a  DTA 
review  proceeding.  The  role  of  an  Article  III  court  in  the 
exercise  of  its  habeas  corpus  function  cannot  be  circum-
scribed in this manner. 

By  foreclosing  consideration  of  evidence  not  presented  or 
reasonably  available  to  the  detainee  at  the  CSRT  proceed-
ings,  the  DTA  disadvantages  the  detainee  by  limiting  the 
scope  of  collateral  review  to  a  record  that  may  not  be  accu-
rate  or  complete.  In  other  contexts,  e. g.,  in  post-trial  ha-
beas cases where the prisoner already has had a full and fair 
opportunity  to  develop  the  factual  predicate  of  his  claims, 
similar limitations on the scope of habeas review may be ap-

propriate.  See  Williams  v.  Taylor,  529  U. S.  420,  436-437 (2000) (noting that $ 2254 "does not equate prisoners who ex-

ercise  diligence  in  pursuing  their  claims  with  those  who  do not").  In  this  context,  however,  where  the  underlying  de-
tention proceedings lack the necessary adversarial character, the detainee cannot be held responsible for all deficiencies in 
the record. The Government  does not  make the  alternative argument 
that  the  DTA  allows  for  the  introduction  of  previously  un-
available exculpatory evidence on appeal.  It does point out, however, that if a detainee obtains such evidence, he can re-

quest  that  the  Deputy  Secretary  of  Defense  convene  a  new 
CSRT.  See Supp. Brief for Federal Respondents 4.  What-
ever the merits of this procedure, it is an insufficient replace-
ment  for  the  factual  review  these  detainees  are  entitled  to 
receive through habeas corpus.  The Deputy Secretary's de-
termination  whether to  initiate  new  proceedings  is  wholly  a 
discretionary  one.  See  Dept.  of  Defense,  Office  for  the  Ad-
ministrative Review of the Detention of Enemy Combatants, 
Instruction 5421.1, Procedure for Review of "New Evidence" 
Relating  to  Enemy  Combatant  (EC)  Status  || 5(d)  (May  7,

fense]").  And  we see  no way  to construe the  DTA  to allow 
a  detainee  to  challenge  the  Deputy  Secretary's  decision  not 
to  open  a  new  CSRT  pursuant  to  Instruction  5421.1.  Con-
gress directed the Secretary of Defense to devise procedures 
for considering new evidence, see DTA $ 1005(a)(3), 119 Stat.

those  procedures  are  followed.  DTA  $ 1005(e)(2)(C),  id.,  at

"limited  to  consideration  of  .  .  .  whether  the  status  deter-
mination  of  the  [CSRT]  with  regard  to  such  alien  was  con-

Secretary  of  Defense  .  .  .  and . . .  whether  the  use  of  such 
standards and procedures to make the determination is con-
sistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States." 
DTA  $ 1005(e)(2)(A), ibid.,  further narrows the Court of Ap-
peals'  jurisdiction  to  reviewing  "any  final  decision  of  a 
[CSRT] that an alien is properly detained as an enemy com-
batant."  The Deputy Secretary's determination whether to 
convene  a  new  CSRT  is  not  a  "status  determination  of  the 
[CSRT]," much less a "final decision" of that body. 

We  do  not  imply  DTA  review  would  be  a  constitutionally 
sufficient replacement for habeas corpus but for these limita-
tions  on  the  detainee's  ability  to  present  exculpatory  evi-
dence.  For  even  if  it  were  possible,  as  a  textual  matter,  to 
read  into  the  statute  each  of  the  necessary  procedures  we 
have  identified,  we  could  not  overlook  the  cumulative  effect 
of  our  doing  so.  To  hold  that  the  detainees  at  Guantanamo 
may, under the  DTA, challenge the  President's legal author-
ity  to  detain  them,  contest  the  CSRT's  findings  of fact,  sup-
plement the record on review with exculpatory evidence, and 
request  an  order  of  release  would  come  close  to  reinstating 
the  $ 2241  habeas  corpus  process  Congress  sought  to  deny 
them.  The  language  of  the  statute,  read  in  light  of  Con-
gress'  reasons  for  enacting  it,  cannot  bear  this  interpreta-
tion.  Petitioners have met their burden of establishing that 
the DTA review process is, on its face, an inadequate substi-
tute for habeas corpus. 

Although we do not hold that an adequate substitute must 
duplicate  $ 2241  in  all  respects,  it  suffices  that  the  Govern-
ment  has  not  established  that  the  detainees'  access  to  the 
statutory  review  provisions  at  issue  is  an  adequate  substi-
tute  for  the  writ  of  habeas  corpus.  MCA  $ 7  thus  effects 
an  unconstitutional  suspension  of  the  writ.  In  view  of 
our  holding  we  need  not  discuss  the  reach  of  the  writ  with 
respect  to  claims  of  unlawful  conditions  of  treatment  or 
confinement.

Opinion of the Court 

VI 

A 
In light of our conclusion that there is no jurisdictional bar to  the  District  Court's  entertaining  petitioners'  claims  the 

question  remains  whether  there  are  prudential  barriers  to habeas corpus review under these circumstances. 

The  Government  argues  petitioners  must  seek  review  of their  CSRT  determinations  in  the  Court  of  Appeals  before 
they can proceed with their habeas corpus actions in the Dis-trict Court.  As noted earlier, in other contexts and for pru-
dential  reasons  this  Court  has  required  exhaustion  of  alter-native  remedies  before  a  prisoner  can  seek  federal  habeas 
relief.  Most  of  these  cases  were  brought  by  prisoners  in state  custody, 

e. g.,  Ex  parte  Royall,  117  U. S.  241,  and  thus involved  federalism  concerns  that  are  not  relevant  here. 

But  we  have  extended  this  rule  to  require  defendants  in courts-martial  to  exhaust  their  military  appeals  before  pro-
ceeding  with  a  federal  habeas  corpus  action.  See  Schle-
singer, 420 U. S., at 758. The  real  risks,  the  real  threats,  of  terrorist  attacks  are 

constant  and  not  likely  soon  to  abate.  The  ways  to  disrupt our life and laws are so many and unforeseen that the Court 
should  not  attempt  even  some  general  catalogue  of  crises that might occur.  Certain principles are apparent, however. 
Practical  considerations  and  exigent  circumstances  inform the  definition  and  reach  of  the  law's  writs,  including  habeas 
corpus.  The cases and our tradition reflect this precept. In cases involving foreign citizens  detained abroad by  the 
Executive, it likely would be both an impractical and unprec-edented  extension  of  judicial  power  to  assume  that  habeas 
corpus  would  be  available  at  the  moment  the  prisoner  is taken  into  custody.  If  and  when  habeas  corpus  jurisdiction 
applies,  as  it  does  in  these  cases,  then  proper  deference  can be  accorded  to  reasonable  procedures  for  screening  and  ini-
tial  detention  under  lawful  and  proper  conditions  of  con-

Opinion of the Court 
finement and treatment for a reasonable period of time.  Do-mestic exigencies, furthermore, might also impose such oner-

ous  burdens  on  the  Government  that  here,  too,  the  Judicial Branch would be required to devise sensible rules for staying 
habeas corpus proceedings until the Government can comply with  its  requirements  in  a  responsible  way.  Cf. 

Ex  parte 
Milligan, 4 Wall., at 127 ("If, in foreign invasion or civil war, 
the courts are actually closed, and it is impossible to adminis-ter  criminal  justice  according  to  law, 

then,  on  the  theatre  of 
active  military  operations,  where  war  really  prevails,  there is  a  necessity  to  furnish  a  substitute  for  the  civil  authority, 

thus overthrown, to preserve the safety of the army and soci-
ety;  and  as  no  power  is  left  but  the  military,  it  is  allowed 
to  govern  by  martial  rule  until  the  laws  can  have  their 
free  course").  Here, as  is  true with  detainees  apprehended 
abroad,  a  relevant  consideration  in  determining  the  courts' 
role  is  whether  there  are  suitable  alternative  processes  in 
place to protect against the arbitrary exercise of governmen-
tal power. 

The cases before us, however, do not involve detainees who 
have  been  held  for  a  short  period  of  time  while  awaiting 
their CSRT determinations.  Were that the case, or were it 
probable that the Court of Appeals could complete a prompt 
review of their applications, the case for requiring temporary 
abstention  or  exhaustion  of  alternative  remedies  would  be 
much stronger.  These qualifications no longer pertain here. 
In  some  of  these  cases  six  years  have  elapsed  without  the 
judicial  oversight  that  habeas  corpus  or  an  adequate  substi-
tute demands.  And there has been no showing that the Ex-
ecutive faces such onerous burdens that it cannot respond to 
habeas  corpus  actions.  To  require  these  detainees  to  com-
plete  DTA  review  before  proceeding  with  their  habeas  cor-
pus  actions  would  be  to  require  additional  months,  if  not 
years,  of  delay.  The  first  DTA  review  applications  were 
filed over two years ago, but no decisions on the merits have 
been  issued.  While  some  delay  in  fashioning  new  proce-

Opinion of the Court 
dures  is  unavoidable,  the  costs  of  delay  can  no  longer  be borne  by  those  who  are  held  in  custody.  The  detainees  in 

these  cases  are  entitled  to  a  prompt  habeas  corpus  hearing. Our  decision  today  holds  only  that  petitioners  before  us 
are  entitled  to  seek  the  writ;  that  the  DTA  review  proce-dures  are  an  inadequate  substitute  for  habeas  corpus;  and 
that  petitioners  in  these  cases  need  not  exhaust  the  review procedures  in  the  Court  of  Appeals  before  proceeding  with 
their  habeas  actions  in  the  District  Court.  The  only  law we identify as unconstituti onal is  MCA $ 7,  28  U. S. C. 

$ 2241(e).  Accordingly, both the DTA and the CSRT process remain  intact.  Our  holding  with  regard  to  exhaustion 
should not be read to imply that a habeas court should inter-vene  the  moment  an  enemy  combatant  steps  foot  in  a  terri-
tory  where  the  writ  runs.  The  Executive  is  entitled  to  a reasonable  period  of  time  to  determine  a  detainee's  status 
before a court entertains that detainee's habeas corpus peti-tion.  The CSRT process is the mechanism Congress and the 
President set up to deal with these issues.  Except in cases of undue delay, federal courts should refrain from entertain-
ing  an  enemy  combatant's  habeas  corpus  petition  at  least until  after  the  Department,  acting  via  the  CSRT,  has  had  a 
chance to review his status. 

B 
Although  we  hold  that  the  DTA  is  not  an  adequate  and effective substitute for habeas corpus, it does not follow that 

a habeas corpus court may disregard the dangers the deten-tion in these cases was intended to prevent. 

Felker, Swain, and  Hayman  stand  for  the  proposition  that  the  Suspension 

Clause  does  not  resist  innovation  in  the  field  of  habeas  cor-pus.  Certain  accommodations  can  be  made  to  reduce  the 
burden habeas corpus proceedings will place on the military without  impermissibly  diluting  the  protections  of  the  writ. 

In the DTA Congress sought to consolidate review of peti-tioners'  claims  in  the  Court  of  Appeals.  Channeling  future

Opinion of the Court 
cases to one district court would no doubt reduce administra-tive burdens on the Government.  This is a legitimate objec-

tive that  might  be  advanced  even  without  an  amendment to $ 2241.  If, in a future case, a detainee files a habeas petition 
in another judicial district in which a proper respondent can be  served,  see 

Rumsfeld  v.  Padilla,  542  U. S.  426,  435-436 (2004), the Government can move for change of venue to the 

court  that  will  hear  these  petitioners'  cases,  the  United States  District  Court  for  the  District  of  Columbia.  See  28 
U. S. C.  $ 1404(a);  Braden  v.  30th  Judicial  Circuit  Court  of Ky., 410 U. S. 484, 499, n. 15 (1973). 

Another  of  Congress'  reasons  for  vesting  exclusive  juris-diction  in  the  Court  of  Appeals,  perhaps,  was  to  avoid  the 
widespread  dissemination  of  classified  information.  The Government has raised similar concerns here and elsewhere. 
See Brief for Federal Respondents 55-56; Bismullah Pet. 30. We  make no attempt  to anticipate  all of the  evidentiary and 
access-to-counsel  issues  that  will  arise  during  the  course  of the  detainees'  habeas  corpus  proceedings.  We  recognize, 
however,  that  the  Government  has  a  legitimate  interest  in protecting  sources  and  methods  of  intelligence  gathering; 
and we expect that the District Court will use its discretion to accommodate this interest to the greatest extent possible. 
Cf.  United  States  v.  Reynolds,  345  U. S.  1,  10  (1953)  (recog-nizing an evidentiary privilege in a civil damages case where 
"there  is  a  reasonable  danger  that  compulsion  of  the  evi-dence  will  expose  military  matters  which,  in  the  interest  of 
national security, should not be divulged"). These  and  the  other  remaining  questions  are  within  the 
expertise and competence of the District Court to address in the first instance.

In considering both the procedural and substantive stand-ards  used  to  impose  detention  to  prevent  acts  of  terrorism, 

proper deference must be accorded to the political branches. See

Opinion of the Court 
304,  320  (1936).  Unlike  the  President  and  some  designated Members  of  Congress,  neither  the  Members  of  this  Court 

nor  most  federal  judges  begin  the  day  with  briefings  that may  describe  new  and  serious  threats  to  our  Nation  and  its 
people.  The  law  must  accord  the  Executive  substantial  au-thority  to  apprehend  and  detain  those  who  pose  a  real  dan-
ger to our security. Officials  charged  with  daily  operational  responsibility  for 
our security may consider a judicial discourse on the history 
of the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679  and like  matters to be far removed  from  the  Nation's  present,  urgent  concerns.  Es-

tablished  legal  doctrine,  however,  must  be  consulted  for  its 
teaching.  Remote in time it may be; irrelevant to the pres-
ent  it  is  not.  Security  depends upon  a  sophisticated intelli-
gence  apparatus  and  the  ability  of  our  Armed  Forces  to  act 
and to interdict.  There are further considerations, however. 
Security subsists, too, in fidelity to freedom's first principles. 
Chief among these are freedom from arbitrary  and unlawful 
restraint  and  the  personal  liberty  that  is  secured  by  adher-
ence to the separation of powers.  It is from these principles 
that  the  judicial  authority  to  consider  petitions  for  habeas 
corpus relief derives. 

Our opinion does not undermine the Executive's powers as 
Commander in Chief.  On the contrary, the exercise of those 
powers  is  vindicated,  not  eroded,  when  confirmed  by  the 
Judicial  Branch.  Within  the  Constitution's  separation-of-
powers  structure,  few  exercises  of  judicial  power  are  as 
legitimate  or  as  necessary  as  the  responsibility  to  hear 
challenges  to  the  authority  of  the  Executive  to  imprison  a 
person.  Some of these petitioners have  been in custody for 
six  years  with  no  definitive  judicial  determination  as  to  the 
legality of their detention.  Their access to the writ is a ne-
cessity  to  determine  the  lawfulness  of  their  status,  even  if, 
in the end, they do not obtain the relief they seek. 

Because  our  Nation's  past  military  conflicts  have  been  of 
limited  duration,  it  has  been  possible  to  leave  the  outer

now  insist  it  was  error  to  allow  the  litigation  to  proceed. Under  Rule  19,  they  contend,  the  action  should  have  been 
dismissed  once  it  became  clear  they  could  not  be  joined  as parties without their consent. 

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, agreeing  with  the  District  Court,  held  the  action  could  pro-
ceed  without  the  Republic  and  the  Commission  as  parties. Among  the  reasons  the  Court  of  Appeals  gave  was  that  the 
absent,  sovereign  entities  would  not  prevail  on  their  claims. We  conclude  the  Court  of  Appeals  gave  insufficient  weight 
to the foreign sovereign status of the Republic and the Com-mission,  and  that  the  court  further  erred  in  reaching  and 
discounting the merits of their claims. 

I  
A  

When the opinion of the Court of Appeals is consulted, the reader  will  find  its  quotations  from  Rule  19  do  not  accord 

with  its  text  as  set  out  here;  for  after  the  case  was  in  the Court  of  Appeals  and  before  it  came  here,  the  text  of  the 
Rule  changed.  The  Rules  Committee  advised  the  changes were stylistic only, see Advisory Committee's Notes on 2007 
Amendment  to  Fed.  Rule  Civ.  Proc.  19,  28  U. S. C.,  p.  826 (2006 ed., Supp. I); and we agree.  These are the three rele-
vant  stylistic  changes.  First,  the  word  "required"  replaced the word "necessary" in subparagraph (a).  Second, the 1966 
Rule set out factors in longer clauses and the 2007 Rule sets out  the  factors  affecting  joinder  in  separate  lettered  head-

quested that Merrill Lynch follow the same course and trans-
fer the Arelma assets to an escrow account at PNB.  Merrill 
Lynch  did  not  do  so.  Facing  claims  from  various  Marcos 
creditors, including the Pimentel class, Merrill Lynch instead 
filed  an  interpleader  action  under  28  U. S. C.  $ 1335.  The 
named  defendants  in  the  interpleader  action  were,  among 
others, the Republic and the Commission, Arelma, PNB, and 
the Pimentel class (the respondents here). 

The  Pimentel  case  had  been  tried  as  a  class  action  before 
Judge  Manuel  Real  of  the  United  States  District  Court  for 
the  Central  District  of  California,  who  was  sitting  by  des-
ignation  in  the  District  of  Hawaii  after  the  Judicial  Panel 
on  Multidistrict  Litigation  consolidated  the  various  human 
rights  complaints  against  Marcos  in  that  court.  See  Hilao,

We  begin  with  the  question  we  asked  the  parties  to  ad-dress when we granted certiorari: Whether the Republic and 

the  Commission,  having  been  dismissed  from  the  inter-pleader  action  based  on  their  successful  assertion  of  sover-
eign  immunity,  had  the  right  to  appeal  the  District  Court's determination  under  Rule  19  that  the  action  could  proceed 
in  their  absence;  and  whether  they  have  the  right  to  seek this  Court's  review  of  the  Court  of  Appeals'  judgment  af-
firming the District Court.  See ibid.

whether to proceed will turn upon factors that are case spe-cific, which is consistent with a Rule based on equitable con-

siderations.  This  is  also  consistent  with  the  fact  that  the determination  of  who  may,  or  must,  be  parties  to  a  suit  has 
consequences  for  the  persons  and  entities  affected  by  the judgment;  for  the  judicial  system  and  its  interest  in  the  in-

A 
As  to  the  first  Rule  19(b)  factor--the  extent  to  which  a judgment  rendered  in  the  person's  absence  might  prejudice 

that  person  or  the  existing  parties,  Fed.  Rule  Civ.  Proc. 19(b)(1)--the  judgment of the Court  of Appeals  is incorrect. 

In  considering  whether  the  Republic  and  the  Commission would  be  prejudiced  if  the  action  were  to  proceed  in  their 
absence,  the  Court  of  Appeals  gave  insufficient  weight  to their  sovereign  status.  The  doctrine  of  foreign  sovereign 
immunity  has  been  recognized  since  early  in  the  history  of our  Nation.  It  is  premised  upon  the  "perfect  equality  and 
absolute  independence  of  sovereigns,  and  th[e]  common  in-terest  impelling  them  to  mutual  intercourse."  Schooner

eign's substantial interest is determined, or at least assumed, by  a  federal  court  in  the  sovereign's  absence  and  over  its 

objection. As explained above, the decision to proceed in the absence 
of the Republic and the  Commission ignored the  substantial prejudice  those  entities  likely  would  incur.  This  most  di-
rectly  implicates  Rule  19(b)'s  first  factor,  which  directs  con-sideration of prejudice both to absent persons and those who 
are  parties.  We  have  discussed  the  absent  entities.  As  to existing parties, we do not discount the Pimentel class' inter-
est  in  recovering  damages  it  was  awarded  pursuant  to  a judgment.  Furthermore,  combating  public  corruption  is  a 
significant  international  policy.  The  policy  is  manifested  in treaties  providing  for  international  cooperation  in  recover-
ing  forfeited  assets.  See,  e.

As  to  the  fourth  Rule  19(b)  factor--whether  the  plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the action were dismissed 
for  nonjoinder,  Fed.  Rule  Civ.  Proc.  19(b)(4)--the  Court  of Appeals  made  much  of  what  it  considered  the  tort  victims' 
lack of an alternative forum should this action be dismissed. This seems to assume the plaintiff in this interpleader action 
was  the  Pimentel  class.  It  is  Merrill  Lynch,  however,  that has the statutory status of plaintiff as the stakeholder in the 
interpleader action. It  is  true  that,  in  an  interpleader  action,  the  stakeholder 
is often neutral as to the outcome, while other parties press claims  in  the  manner  of  a  plaintiff.  That  is  insufficient, 
though,  to  overcome  the  statement  in  the  interpleader  stat-ute  that  the  stakeholder  is  the  plaintiff.  See  28  U. S. C. 

$ 1335(a) (conditioning jurisdiction in part upon whether "the plaintiff has deposited such money or property" at issue with 
the  district  court  or has  "given  bond payable to the  clerk of the  court  in  such  amount  and  with  such  surety  as  the  court 
or judge may deem proper").  We do not ignore that, in con-text,  the  Pimentel  class  (and  indeed  all  interpleader  claim-
ants) are to some extent comparable to the plaintiffs in non-interpleader cases.  Their interests are not irrelevant to the 
Rule 19(b) equitable balance; but the other provisions of the Rule are the relevant ones to consult. 

Merrill  Lynch,  as the  stakeholder,  makes  the point  that  if the  action  is  dismissed  it  loses  the  benefit  of  a  judgment 
allowing it to disburse the assets and be done with the mat-ter.  Dismissal  of  the  action,  it  urges,  leaves  it  without  an 
adequate  remedy,  for  it  "could  potentially  be  forced  .  .  .  to defend  lawsuits  by  the  various  claimants  in  different  juris-
dictions, possibly leading to inconsistent judgments."  Brief for Merrill Lynch as

Appendix to opinion of the Court 
The  balance  of  equities  may  change  in  due  course.  One relevant  change  may  occur  if  it  appears  that  the  Sandigan-

bayan cannot or will not issue its ruling within a reasonable period  of  time.  Other  changes  could  result  when  and  if 
there  is  a  ruling.  If  the  Sandiganbayan  rules  that  the  Re-public and the Commission have no right to the assets, their 
claims in some later interpleader suit would be less substan-tial  than  they  are  now.  If  the  ruling  is  that  the  Republic 
and  the  Commission  own  the  assets,  then  they  may  seek  to enforce a judgment in our courts; or consent to become par-
ties in an interpleader suit, where their claims could be con-sidered;  or file  in  some  other forum  if  they  can  obtain  juris-
diction over the relevant persons.  We do note that if Merrill Lynch, or other parties, elect to commence further litigation 
in light of changed circumstances, it would not be necessary to file the new action in the District Court where this action 
arose,  provided  venue  and  jurisdictional  requirements  are satisfied  elsewhere.  The  present  action,  however,  may  not 
proceed.  * * * 

The  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Ninth  Cir-cuit  is  reversed,  and  the  case  is  remanded  with  instructions 
to  order  the  District  Court  to  dismiss  the  interpleader action.

Opinion of the Court 
The  virtual  representation  question  we  examine  in  this opinion  arises  in  the  following  context.  Petitioner  Brent 

Taylor filed a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act seeking  certain  documents  from  the  Federal  Aviation  Ad-
ministration.  Greg  Herrick, Taylor's  friend, had  previously brought an unsuccessful suit seeking the same records.  The 
two men have no legal relationship, and there is no evidence that Taylor controlled, financed, participated in, or even had 
notice of Herrick's earlier suit.  Nevertheless, the D. C. Cir-cuit  held  Taylor's  suit  precluded  by  the  judgment  against 
Herrick because, in that court's assessment, Herrick qualified as Taylor's "virtual representative." 

We  disapprove  the  doctrine  of  preclusion  by  "virtual  rep-resentation," and hold, based on the record as it now stands, 
that the judgment against Herrick does not bar Taylor from maintaining this suit. 

I 
The  Freedom  of  Information  Act  (FOIA  or  Act)  accords "any person" a right to request any records held by a federal 

agency.  5 U. S. C. $ 552(a)(3)(A) (2006 ed.).  No reason need be  given  for  a  FOIA  request,  and  unless  the  requested  ma-
terials  fall  within  one  of  the  Act's  enumerated  exemptions, see  $ 552(a)(3)(E),  (b),  the  agency  must  "make  the  records 
promptly  available"  to  the  requester,  $ 552(a)(3)(A).  If  an agency  refuses  to  furnish  the  requested  records,  the  re-
quester may file suit in federal court and obtain an injunction "order[ing] the production of any agency records improperly 
withheld."  $ 552(a)(4)(B). The  courts  below  held  the  instant  FOIA  suit  barred  by 
the  judgment  in  earlier  litigation  seeking  the  same  records. Because the lower courts' decisions turned on the connection 
between  the  two  lawsuits,  we  begin  with  a  full  account  of each action.

Opinion of the Court 
The  record  before  the  District  Court  in  Taylor's  suit  re-vealed  the  following  facts  about  the  relationship  between 

Taylor  and  Herrick:  Taylor  is  the  president  of  the  Antique Aircraft  Association,  an  organization  to  which  Herrick  be-
longs; the two men  are "close  associate[s]," App. 54;  Herrick asked Taylor to help restore Herrick's F-45, though they had 
no  contract  or  agreement  for  Taylor's  participation  in  the 
restoration;  Taylor was represented by  the lawyer who rep-resented Herrick in the earlier litigation; and Herrick appar-

ently gave Taylor documents that Herrick had obtained from the FAA during discovery in his suit. 

Fairchild  and  the  FAA  conceded  that  Taylor  had  not  par-
ticipated in Herrick's suit.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a.  The 
D.  C.  District  Court  determined,  however,  that  Herrick 
ranked  as  Taylor's  virtual  representative  because  the  facts 
fit  each  of  the  other  six  indicators  on  the  Eighth  Circuit's 
list.  See  id.,

that  Taylor  agreed  to  be  bound  by  Herrick's  litigation,  that Taylor  and  Herrick  have  any  legal  relationship,  that  Taylor 

exercised  any  control  over  Herrick's  suit,  or  that  this  suit implicates any special statutory scheme limiting relitigation. 
Neither the FAA nor Fairchild contends otherwise. It is equally clear that preclusion cannot be justified on the 
theory  that  Taylor  was  adequately  represented  in  Herrick's 
suit.  Nothing  in  the  record  indicates  that  Herrick  under-stood himself to be suing on Taylor's behalf, that Taylor even 

knew  of  Herrick's  suit,  or  that  the  Wyoming  District  Court took  special  care  to  protect  Taylor's  interests.  Under  our 
pathmarking  precedent,  therefore,  Herrick's  representation 
was not "adequate."  See Richards,

decision  in  Baze,  ante,  p.  35;  it  requested  additional  briefing  on the  impact  of  Baze  the  day  after  that  opinion  issued,  received 
those  briefs  on  May  2,  and  heard  oral  argument  on  Wednesday, May  14.  I  therefore  believe  we  should  leave  our  stay  in  place 
until  the  Fourth  Circuit  has  an  adequate  opportunity  to  render  a decision  on  the  merits  of  Emmett's  claim.  The  parties'  filings 
with  this  Court  highlight  the  existence  of  factual  disputes  con-cerning Virginia's lethal injection protocol, including  whether it is 
substantially  similar  to  the  Kentucky  protocol  we  declined  to strike  down  in  Baze.  Because  the  Fourth  Circuit  has  the  trial 
record before it, and also has the benefit of extensive briefing and argument,  it  is  in  a  significantly  better  position  than  we  are  to 
make  these  factual  judgments  when  it  rules  on  the  merits  of Emmett's  appeal. 

Although  the  parties  are  of  course  free  to  request  a  stay  from the  Fourth  Circuit--a  request  that  the  court  may  well  grant  in 
order  to  complete  its  consideration  of  Emmett's  appeal  without the  pressure  of  a  looming  execution  date--I  would  not  require 
the  parties  to  shoulder  the  additional  burden  of  filing superfluous papers when simply leaving our stay in place until final disposition 
by  the  Court  of  Appeals  would  also  give  the  Fourth  Circuit  an opportunity  to  consider  these  important  issues  in  the  regular 
course.  Accordingly,  I  respectfully  dissent.

ADMINISTRATIVE  REFUND  CLAIMS.  See  Taxes,  1.  
AGE  DISCRIMINATION  IN  EMPLOYMENT  ACT  OF  1967.  

Federal-sector employment discrimination--Retaliation claim.-- 
ADEA's federal-sector provision, 29 U. S. C. $ 633a(a)--which requires that 
"[a]ll personnel actions affecting employees . . . at  least 40 years of age . . .  
be made free from any discrimination based on age"--prohibits retaliation 
against a federal employee who complains of age discrimination.  Go'mez-
Pe'rez v. Potter, p. 474.

CIVIL  RIGHTS  ACT  OF  1866. 

Employment  discrimination--Retaliation  claim.--Title  42  U. S. C. 

$ 1981--which  gives  "[a]ll  persons  .  .  .  the  same  right  .  .  .  to  make  and 
enforce  contracts  .  .  .  as  is  enjoyed  by  white  citizens"--encompasses  a 
complaint of retaliation against a person who complained about a violation 
of  another  person's  employment-contract-related  "right."  CBOCS  West, 
Inc. v. Humphries, p. 442. 

CLASS-OF-ONE  EQUAL  PROTECTION  THEORY.  See  Constitu-

tional  Law,  IV. 

COMMERCE  CLAUSE.  See  Constitutional  Law,  I. 
CONSTITUTIONAL  LAW. 
I.  Commerce  Clause. 

Discrimination against interstate commerce--State  taxes  on  bonds.-- 
Kentucky's  differential  tax  scheme--which  exempts  from  state  income 
taxes  interest  on  bonds  issued  by  Kentucky  or  its  political  subdivisions 
but not on bonds issued by other States and their subdivisions--does not 
offend Commerce Clause.  Department of Revenue of Ky. v. Davis, p. 328. 

II.  Cruel  and  Unusual  Punishment. 

Execution  methods--Lethal-injection  protocol.--Kentucky  Supreme 
Court's judgment upholding Kentucky's three-drug lethal-injection proto-
col  against  petitioners'  claim  that  it  violates  Eighth  Amendment's  "cruel 
and unusual punishments" ban is affirmed.  Baze v. Rees, p. 35. 

III.  Due  Process. 

Vagueness--Child  pornography.--As  construed  by  this  Court,  18 
U. S. C.  $ 2252A(a)(3)(B)--which  criminalizes,  in  specified  circumstances, 
pandering  or  solicitation  of  child  pornography--is  not  impermissibly 
vague under Due Process Clause.  United States v. Williams, p. 285. 

IV.  Equal  Protection  of  the  Laws. 

"Class  of  one"--Public  employment.--"Class-of-one"  equal  protection 
theory--under  which  a  claimant  alleges  that  she  was  mistreated  not  be-
cause she was a member of an  identified class (e. g., race, sex,  or national 
origin),  but  simply  for  arbitrary,  vindictive,  and  malicious  reasons--does 
not  apply  in  public  employment  context.  Engquist  v.  Oregon  Dept.  of 
Agriculture, p. 591. 

V.  Freedom  of  Speech. 

Overbreadth  doctrine--Child  pornography.--As  construed  by  this 
Court,  18  U. S. C.  $ 2252A(a)(3)(B)--which  criminalizes,  in  specified  cir-
cumstances,  pandering  or  solicitation  of  child  pornography--is  not  over-
broad under First Amendment.  United States v. Williams, p. 285.

CONSTITUTIONAL  LAW--Continued. 
VI.  Right to Vote.  

Photo identification requirement.--Seventh Circuit's judgment uphold-
ing  constitutionality  of  an  Indiana  statute  requiring  citizens  voting  in 
person  to  present  government-issued  photo  identification  is  affirmed. 
Crawford v. Marion County Election Bd., p. 181. 

VII.  Searches  and  Seizures. 

Probable  cause  for  arrest--Search  incident  to  arrest.--Police  did  not 
violate Fourth Amendment when they made  an arrest that was based on 
probable cause but  prohibited by  Virginia law or when  they performed a 
search incident to that arrest.  Virginia v. Moore, p. 164. 

VIII.  Suspension  Clause. 

Habeas  corpus  privilege--Withdrawal  of  federal-court  jurisdiction.-- 
Petitioners, aliens designated as enemy combatants and detained at Guan-
tanamo  Bay,  Cuba,  have  constitutional  privilege  of  habeas  corpus,  which 
cannot  be  withdrawn  except  in  conformance with  Suspension  Clause;  be-
cause  Detainee  Treatment  Act  of  2005's  procedures  for  review  of  detain-
ees' status are not an adequate and  effective substitute for  habeas, $ 7  of 
Military Commissions Act  of 2006, which withdraws federal-court  habeas 
jurisdiction  with  respect  to  petitioners,  operates  as  an  unconstitutional 
suspension of writ.  Boumediene v. Bush, p. 723. 

CRIMINAL  LAW.  See  also  Constitutional  Law,  II;  III;  V;  VII;  Fed-

eral  Magistrates  Act. 

1.  Armed  Career  Criminal  Act--Sentence  enhancement--State  drug-
trafficking convictions--Sentencing under state recidivist law.--Because 
a state  drug-trafficking  conviction  qualifies  as "a  serious  drug  offense" if 
"a  maximum  term . . .  of  ten  years  or  more  is  prescribed  by  law,"  18 
U. S. C.  $ 924(e)(2)(A)(ii),  and  maximum  term  respondent  faced  on  Wash-
ington  state  drug  convictions  was  10  years  under  a  state  recidivist  law, 
those  state  convictions  had  to  be  counted  under  ACCA  to  enhance  re-
spondent's  sentence  on his conviction  for federal  crime of  possession  of  a 
firearm  by  a  convicted  felon,  $ 922(g)(1).  United  States  v.  Rodriquez, 
p. 377. 

2.  Armed Career Criminal Act--Violent felony--Felony driving under 
influence  conviction.--Felony  driving  under  influence  of  alcohol,  as  de-
fined  by  New  Mexico  law,  is  not  a  "violent  felony"  under  ACCA,  which 
provides a 15-year mandatory minimum prison term for a defendant, con-
victed of possessing a firearm, who has three prior convictions "for a vio-
lent felony," 18 U. S. C. $ 924(e)(1).  Begay v. United States, p. 137. 

3.  Carrying  explosives  while  making  a  false  statement  to  a  customs 
official--Relationship  between  explosive  carried  and  underlying  fel-
ony.--Since  respondent  was  carrying  explosives  when  he  made  a  false

1170  INDEX 
CRIMINAL  LAW--Continued. 
statement  to  a  customs  official  in  violation  of  18  U. S. C.  $ 1001,  he  was 
carrying  them  "during "  commission  of  that  felony,  in  violation  of 

$ 844(h)(2), even though there was no relationship between explosive car-
ried and underlying felony.  United States v. Ressam, p. 272. 

4.  Federal  drug  offenses--Mandatory  minimum  sentences  based  on 
previous  felony  convictions--Effect  of  state-law  classification  of  offense.--Under  21 U. S. C.  $ 841(b)(1)(A),  which  enhances mandatory  mini-
mum  sentence  for  certain  federal  drug  crimes  when  defendant  was  pre-
viously  convicted  of  a  "felony  drug  offense,"  quoted  term  is  defined 
exclusively by $ 802(44) to "mea[n] an offense . . . punishable by imprison-
ment for more than one year under any law of . . . a State,"  and  does not 
incorporate  $ 802(13)'s  definition  of  "felony"  as  any  "offense  classified  by 
applicable . . .  law  as a  felony," so that a state drug offense punishable by 
more than one year qualifies as a "felony drug offense," even if state law 
classifies offense as a misdemeanor.  Burgess v. United States, p. 124. 

5.  Money laundering--Vacatur of convictions.--Seventh Circuit's 
judgment  affirming  District  Court's  vacatur  of  respondents'  money-
laundering  convictions  on  grounds  that  18  U. S. C.  $ 1956(a)(1)(A)'s  crimi-
nal  "proceeds"  strictures  apply  to  transactions  involving  criminal 
"profits,"  not  criminal  "receipts,"  and  that  there  was  no  evidence  that 
transactions  on  which  convictions  were  based  involved  profits  from  re-
spondents' illegal lottery operation, is affirmed.  United States v. Santos, 
p. 507. 

6.  Sentencing--Variance from Federal Guidelines range--Federal 
Rules  of  Criminal  Procedure.--Rule  32(h)'s  notice  requirement  does  not 
apply  to  a  variance  from  a  recommended  Federal  Sentencing  Guidelines 
range.  Irizarry v. United States, p. 708. 

7.  Transporting  unlawful-activity  proceeds  across  border--Proof  re-
quirement.--Although 18 U. S. C. $ 1956(a)(2)(B)(i)--which prohibits trans-
porting unlawful-activity proceeds across border knowing that transporta-
tion  was  designed  "to  conceal  or  disguise  the  nature,  the  location,  the 
source,  the  ownership,  or  the  control"  of  funds--does  not  require  proof 
that  defendant  attempted  to  create appearance  of  legitimate  wealth,  nei-
ther can it be satisfied solely by evidence that funds were concealed during 
transport:  A  conviction  requires  proof  that  transportation's  purpose,  not 
merely its effect, was to conceal or disguise one of listed attributes.  Re-
galado Cuellar v. United States, p. 550.

FALSE  CLAIMS  ACT. 

Proof  requirements.--It  is  insufficient  for  a  plaintiff  asserting  a  cause 
of action under Act to show merely that use of a false statement resulted 
in  payment  or  approval  of  a  false  claim  or  that  Government  money  was 
used  to pay claim; instead,  such  a  plaintiff  must  prove that defendant  in-
tended  that  false  statement  be  material  to  Government's  decision  to  pay 
or approve false claim; nor is it enough for a plaintiff to show that alleged 
conspirators agreed upon a fraud scheme that had effect of causing a pri-
vate  entity  to  make  payments  using  money  obtained  from  Government; 
instead,  it  must  be  shown  that  they  intended  "to  defraud  Government."

Jury  selection--Waiver  of  right  to  an  Article  III  judge--Sufficiency 
of  defense  counsel's  consent.--Express  consent  by  a  defendant's  counsel 
suffices to waive right to have an Article III judge preside over jury selec-
tion  in  a  federal  felony  trial  and  to  permit  a magistrate  judge  to  preside

case  authorizes  sale  of  components  that  substantially  embody  patents  in 
suit, doctrine prevents respondent from further asserting its patent rights

TAXES.  See  also  Constitutional  Law,  I. 

1.  Federal  taxes--Refund  claim--Collection  in  violation  of  Export 
Clause.--Plain language of 26 U. S. C. $$ 7422(a) and 6511 requires a tax-
payer  seeking  a  refund  for  a  tax  assessed  in  violation  of  Export  Clause, 
just as for any other  unlawfully  assessed  tax, to file a  timely administra-
tive  refund  claim  before  bringing  suit  against  Government.  United 
States v. Clintwood Elkhorn Mining Co., p. 1. 

2.  State taxes--Capital gains--Unitary businesses.--Illinois courts 
erred  in  upholding  a  state  tax  on  an  apportioned  share  of  a  multistate 
corporation's  capital  gain  realized  from  sale  of  a  business  division  after 
those courts determined that division and corporation were not "unitary."

Preclearance--New election practice invalidated--Prior practice rein-
stated.--Because  an  Alabama  election  law  invalidated  by  State  Supreme 
Court under State Constitution never gained "force or effect" for purposes 
of $ 5 of VRA, Alabama's reinstatement of its prior gubernatorial appoint-
ment  practice  did  not  rank  as  a  "change"  requiring  preclearance.  Riley
