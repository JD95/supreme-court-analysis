CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 1995

JAFFEE, special administrator for ALLEN,

DECEASED v. REDMOND et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 95-266. Argued February 26, 1996--Decided June 13, 1996
Petitioner, the administrator of decedent Allen's estate, filed this action

alleging that Allen's constitutional rights were violated when he was
killed by respondent Redmond, an on-duty police officer employed by
respondent village. The court ordered respondents to give petitioner
notes made by Karen Beyer, a licensed clinical social worker, during
counseling sessions with Redmond after the shooting, rejecting their
argument that a psychotherapist-patient privilege protected the contents of the conversations. Neither Beyer nor Redmond complied with
the order. At trial, the jury awarded petitioner damages after being
instructed that the refusal to turn over the notes was legally unjustified
and the jury could presume that the notes would have been unfavorable
to respondents. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, finding
that "reason and experience," the touchstones for acceptance of a privilege under Federal Rule of Evidence 501, compelled recognition of a
psychotherapist-patient privilege. However, it found that the privilege
would not apply if, in the interests of justice, the evidentiary need for
disclosure outweighed the patient's privacy interests. Balancing those
interests, the court concluded that Beyer's notes should have been
protected.

2 JAFFEE v. REDMOND

Syllabus
Held: The conversations between Redmond and her therapist and the

notes taken during their counseling sessions are protected from compelled disclosure under Rule 501. Pp. 8-18.

(a) Rule 501 authorizes federal courts to define new privileges by
interpreting "the principles of the common law . . . in the light of reason
and experience." The Rule thus did not freeze the law governing privileges at a particular point in history, but rather directed courts to "continue the evolutionary development of testimonial privileges." Trammel v. United States, 445 U. S. 40, 47. An exception from the general
rule disfavoring testimonial privileges is justified when the proposed
privilege "promotes sufficiently important interests to outweigh the
need for probative evidence . . . ." Id., at 51. Pp. 8-10.

(b) Significant private interests support recognition of a psychotherapist privilege. Effective psychotherapy depends upon an atmosphere
of confidence and trust, and therefore the mere possibility of disclosure
of confidential communications may impede development of the relationship necessary for successful treatment. The privilege also serves the
public interest, since the mental health of the Nation's citizenry, no less
than its physical health, is a public good of transcendent importance.
In contrast, the likely evidentiary benefit that would result from the
denial of the privilege is modest. That it is appropriate for the federal
courts to recognize a psychotherapist privilege is confirmed by the fact
that all 50 States and the District of Columbia have enacted into law
some form of the privilege, see Trammel v. United States, 445 U. S., at
48-50, and reinforced by the fact that the privilege was among the specific privileges recommended in the proposed privilege rules that were
rejected in favor of the more open-ended language of the present Rule
501. Pp. 10-15.

(c) The federal privilege, which clearly applies to psychiatrists and
psychologists, also extends to confidential communications made to licensed social workers in the course of psychotherapy. The reasons for
recognizing the privilege for treatment by psychiatrists and psychologists apply with equal force to clinical social workers, and the vast majority of States explicitly extend a testimonial privilege to them. The
balancing component implemented by the Court of Appeals and a few
States is rejected, for it would eviscerate the effectiveness of the privilege by making it impossible for participants to predict whether their
confidential conversations will be protected. Because this is the first
case in which this Court has recognized a psychotherapist privilege, it
is neither necessary nor feasible to delineate its full contours in a way
that would govern all future questions. Pp. 15-18.

51 F. 3d 1346, affirmed.

Opinion of the Court
licensed clinical social worker. The question we address iswhether statements the officer made to her therapist during

the counseling sessions are protected from compelled disclo-sure in a federal civil action brought by the family of the
deceased. Stated otherwise, the question is whether it isappropriate for federal courts to recognize a "psychotherapist privilege" under Rule 501 of the Federal Rules ofEvidence.

I
Petitioner is the administrator of the estate of RickyAllen. Respondents are Mary Lu Redmond, a former police

officer, and the Village of Hoffman Estates, Illinois, her em-ployer during the time that she served on the police force.

1

Petitioner commenced this action against respondents afterRedmond shot and killed Allen while on patrol duty.

On June 27, 1991, Redmond was the first officer to respondto a "fight in progress" call at an apartment complex. As
she arrived at the scene, two of Allen's sisters ran towardher squad car, waving their arms and shouting that there
had been a stabbing in one of the apartments. Redmond
testified at trial that she relayed this information to her dis-patcher and requested an ambulance. She then exited her

car and walked toward the apartment building. BeforeRedmond reached the building, several men ran out, one
waving a pipe. When the men ignored her order to get onthe ground, Redmond drew her service revolver. Two other
men then burst out of the building, one, Ricky Allen, chasingthe other. According to Redmond, Allen was brandishing a
butcher knife and disregarded her repeated commands to
drop the weapon. Redmond shot Allen when she believedhe was about to stab the man he was chasing. Allen died

at the scene. Redmond testified that before other officers

lawsuit.

Opinion of the Court
arrived to provide support, "people came pouring out of the
buildings," App. 134, and a threatening confrontation between her and the crowd ensued.

Petitioner filed suit in Federal District Court alleging that
Redmond had violated Allen's constitutional rights by using
excessive force during the encounter at the apartment
complex. The complaint sought damages under Rev. Stat.

$ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, and the Illinois wrongful-death
statute, Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 740, $ 180/1 et seq. (1994). At
trial, petitioner presented testimony from members of Allen's family that conflicted with Redmond's version of the
incident in several important respects. They testified, for
example, that Redmond drew her gun before exiting her
squad car and that Allen was unarmed when he emerged
from the apartment building.

During pretrial discovery petitioner learned that after the
shooting Redmond had participated in about 50 counseling
sessions with Karen Beyer, a clinical social worker licensed
by the State of Illinois and employed at that time by the
Village of Hoffman Estates. Petitioner sought access to
Beyer's notes concerning the sessions for use in crossexamining Redmond. Respondents vigorously resisted the
discovery. They asserted that the contents of the conversations between Beyer and Redmond were protected against
involuntary disclosure by a psychotherapist-patient privilege. The district judge rejected this argument. Neither
Beyer nor Redmond, however, complied with his order to
disclose the contents of Beyer's notes. At depositions and
on the witness stand both either refused to answer certain
questions or professed an inability to recall details of their
conversations.

In his instructions at the end of the trial, the judge advised
the jury that the refusal to turn over Beyer's notes had no
"legal justification" and that the jury could therefore presume that the contents of the notes would have been un518us1$69i 05-19-99 16:33:54 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
favorable to respondents.2 The jury awarded petitioner
$45,000 on the federal claim and $500,000 on her state-law
claim.

The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed and
remanded for a new trial. Addressing the issue for the first
time, the court concluded that "reason and experience," the
touchstones for acceptance of a privilege under Rule 501
of the Federal Rules of Evidence, compelled recognition of
a psychotherapist-patient privilege.3 51 F. 3d 1346, 1355
(1995). "Reason tells us that psychotherapists and patients
share a unique relationship, in which the ability to communicate freely without the fear of public disclosure is the key to
successful treatment." Id., at 1355-1356. As to experience, the court observed that all 50 States have adopted
some form of the psychotherapist-patient privilege. Id., at
1356. The court attached particular significance to the fact
that Illinois law expressly extends such a privilege to social
workers like Karen Beyer.4 Id., at 1357. The court also
noted that, with one exception, the federal decisions rejecting the privilege were more than five years old and that the
"need and demand for counseling services has skyrocketed
during the past several years." Id., at 1355-1356.

2 App. to Pet. for Cert. 67.
3 Rule 501 provides as follows: "Except as otherwise required by the

Constitution of the United States or provided by Act of Congress or in
rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority,
the privilege of a witness, person, government, State, or political subdivision thereof shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they
may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of
reason and experience. However, in civil actions and proceedings, with
respect to an element of a claim or defense as to which State law supplies
the rule of decision, the privilege of a witness, person, government, State
or political subdivision thereof shall be determined in accordance with
State law."

Opinion of the Court
The Court of Appeals qualified its recognition of the privilege by stating that it would not apply if, "in the interests
of justice, the evidentiary need for the disclosure of the
contents of a patient's counseling sessions outweighs that
patient's privacy interests." Id., at 1357. Balancing those
conflicting interests, the court observed, on the one hand,
that the evidentiary need for the contents of the confidential
conversations was diminished in this case because there
were numerous eyewitnesses to the shooting, and, on the
other hand, that Officer Redmond's privacy interests were
substantial.5 Id., at 1358. Based on this assessment, the
court concluded that the trial court had erred by refusing to
afford protection to the confidential communications between
Redmond and Beyer.

The United States Courts of Appeals do not uniformly
agree that the federal courts should recognize a psychotherapist privilege under Rule 501. Compare In re Doe, 964 F. 2d
1325 (CA2 1992) (recognizing privilege); In re Zuniga, 714
F. 2d 632 (CA6) (same), cert. denied, 464 U. S. 983 (1983),
with United States v. Burtrum, 17 F. 3d 1299 (CA10) (declining to recognize privilege), cert. denied, 513 U. S. 863 (1994);
In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 867 F. 2d 562 (CA9) (same),
cert. denied sub nom. Doe v. United States, 493 U. S. 906

Meagher, 531 F. 2d 752 (CA5) (same), cert. denied, 429 U. S.
853 (1976). Because of the conflict among the Courts of

5 "Her ability, through counseling, to work out the pain and anguish undoubtedly caused by Allen's death in all probability depended to a great
deal upon her trust and confidence in her counselor Karen Beyer. Officer
Redmond, and all those placed in her most unfortunate circumstances, are
entitled to be protected in their desire to seek counseling after mortally
wounding another human being in the line of duty. An individual who is
troubled as the result of her participation in a violent and tragic event,
such as this, displays a most commendable respect for human life and is a
person well-suited `to protect and to serve.' " 51 F. 3d, at 1358.

Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence authorizes fed-eral courts to define new privileges by interpreting "common

law principles . . . in the light of reason and experience."The authors of the Rule borrowed this phrase from our opinion in Wolfle v. United States, 291 U. S. 7, 12 (1934),6 whichin turn referred to the oft-repeated observation that "the
common law is not immutable but flexible, and by its ownprinciples adapts itself to varying conditions."

Funk v.
United States, 290 U. S. 371, 383 (1933). See also Hawkinsv. United States, 358 U. S. 74, 79 (1958) (changes in privileges

may be "dictated by `reason and experience' "). The SenateReport accompanying the 1975 adoption of the Rules indicates that Rule 501 "should be understood as reflecting theview that the recognition of a privilege based on a confidential relationship . . . should be determined on a case-by-casebasis." S. Rep. No. 93-1277, p. 13 (1974).

7 The Rule thus

6 "[T]he rules governing the competence of witnesses in criminal trials
in the federal courts are not necessarily restricted to those local rules in
force at the time of the admission into the Union of the particular state
where the trial takes place, but are governed by common law principles
as interpreted and applied by the federal courts in the light of reason
and experience. Funk v. United States, 290 U. S. 371." Wolfle v. United
States, 291 U. S., at 12-13.

7 In 1972 the Chief Justice transmitted to Congress proposed Rules of

Evidence for United States Courts and Magistrates. 56 F. R. D. 183
(hereinafter Proposed Rules). The Rules had been formulated by the Judicial Conference Advisory Committee on Rules of Evidence and approved
by the Judicial Conference of the United States and by this Court. Trammel v. United States, 445 U. S. 40, 47 (1980). The Proposed Rules defined
nine specific testimonial privileges, including a psychotherapist-patient
privilege, and indicated that these were to be the exclusive privileges
absent constitutional mandate, Act of Congress, or revision of the Rules.
Proposed Rules 501-513, 56 F. R. D., at 230-261. Congress rejected this
recommendation in favor of Rule 501's general mandate. Trammel, 445
U. S., at 47.

Opinion of the Court
did not freeze the law governing the privileges of witnesses
in federal trials at a particular point in our history, but
rather directed federal courts to "continue the evolutionary
development of testimonial privileges." Trammel v. United
States, 445 U. S. 40, 47 (1980); see also University of Pennsylvania v. EEOC, 493 U. S. 182, 189 (1990).

The common-law principles underlying the recognition of
testimonial privileges can be stated simply. " `For more
than three centuries it has now been recognized as a fundamental maxim that the public . . . has a right to every man's
evidence. When we come to examine the various claims of
exemption, we start with the primary assumption that there
is a general duty to give what testimony one is capable of
giving, and that any exemptions which may exist are distinctly exceptional, being so many derogations from a positive general rule.' " United States v. Bryan, 339 U. S. 323,
331 (1950) (quoting 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 2192, p. 64 (3d
ed. 1940)).8 See also United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683,
709 (1974). Exceptions from the general rule disfavoring
testimonial privileges may be justified, however, by a " `public good transcending the normally predominant principle of
utilizing all rational means for ascertaining truth.' " Trammel, 445 U. S., at 50 (quoting Elkins v. United States, 364
U. S. 206, 234 (1960) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting)).

Guided by these principles, the question we address today
is whether a privilege protecting confidential communications between a psychotherapist and her patient "promotes
sufficiently important interests to outweigh the need for

8 The familiar expression "every man's evidence" was a well-known
phrase as early as the mid-18th century. Both the Duke of Argyll and
Lord Chancellor Hardwicke invoked the maxim during the May 25, 1742,
debate in the House of Lords concerning a bill to grant immunity to witnesses who would give evidence against Sir Robert Walpole, first Earl of
Orford. 12 T. Hansard, Parliamentary History of England 643, 675, 693,
697 (1812). The bill was defeated soundly. Id., at 711.

Opinion of the Court
probative evidence . . . ." 445 U. S., at 51. Both "reasonand experience" persuade us that it does.

III
Like the spousal and attorney-client pr ivileges, thepsychotherapist-patient privilege is "rooted in the imperative need for confidence and trust." Ibid. Treatment by aphysician for physical ailments can often proceed successfully on the basis of a physical examination, objective infor-mation supplied by the patient, and the results of diagnostic
tests. Effective psychotherapy, by contrast, depends uponan atmosphere of confidence and trust in which the patient
is willing to make a frank and complete disclosure of facts,emotions, memories, and fears. Because of the sensitive nature of the problems for which individuals consult psycho-therapists, disclosure of confidential communications made
during counseling sessions may cause embarrassment or dis-grace. For this reason, the mere possibility of disclosure
may impede development of the confidential relationshipnecessary for successful treatment.

9 As the Judicial Conference Advisory Committee observed in 1972 when itrecommended that Congress recognize a psychotherapist

privilege as part of the Proposed Federal Rules of Evidence,a psychiatrist's ability to help her patients

" `is completely dependent upon [the patients'] willing-ness and ability to talk freely. This makes it difficult if
not impossible for [a psychiatrist] to function withoutbeing able to assure . . . patients of confidentiality and,
indeed, privileged communication. Where there maybe exceptions to this general rule . . . , there is wide

agreement that confidentiality is a sine qua non for suc-cessful psychiatric treatment.' " Advisory Committee's

Association et al. as Amici Curiae 14-17 and the Brief for American
Psychological Association as Amicus Curiae 12-17.

Opinion of the Court
Notes to Proposed Rules, 56 F. R. D. 183, 242 (1972)(quoting Group for Advancement of Psychiatry, Report

No. 45, Confidentiality and Privileged Communication inthe Practice of Psychiatry 92 (June 1960)).

By protecting confidential communications between a psy-chotherapist and her patient from involuntary disclosure, the
proposed privilege thus serves important private interests.Our cases make clear that an asserted privilege must also
"serv[e] public ends." Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U. S.383, 389 (1981). Thus, the purpose of the attorney-client
privilege is to "encourage full and frank communication be-tween attorneys and their clients and thereby promote
broader public interests in the observance of law and admin-istration of justice."

Ibid. And the spousal privilege, asmodified in Trammel, is justified because it "furthers the important public interest in marital harmony," 445 U. S., at 53.See also

United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S., at 705; Wolfle v.United States, 291 U. S., at 14. The psychotherapist privilege serves the public interest by facilitating the provisionof appropriate treatment for individuals suffering the effects
of a mental or emotional problem. The mental health of ourcitizenry, no less than its physical health, is a public good of
transcendent importance.10In contrast to the significant public and private interests
supporting recognition of the privilege, the likely evidentiarybenefit that would result from the denial of the privilege is
modest. If the privilege were rejected, confidential conver10 This case amply demonstrates the importance of allowing individuals
to receive confidential counseling. Police officers engaged in the dangerous and difficult tasks associated with protecting the safety of our communities not only confront the risk of physical harm but also face stressful
circumstances that may give rise to anxiety, depression, fear, or anger.
The entire community may suffer if police officers are not able to receive
effective counseling and treatment after traumatic incidents, either because trained officers leave the profession prematurely or because those
in need of treatment remain on the job.

sations between psychotherapists and their patients wouldsurely be chilled, particularly when it is obvious that the

circumstances that give rise to the need for treatment willprobably result in litigation. Without a privilege, much of
the desirable evidence to which litigants such as petitionerseek access--for example, admissions against interest by a
party--is unlikely to come into being. This unspoken "evi-dence" will therefore serve no greater truth-seeking function
than if it had been spoken and privileged.That it is appropriate for the federal courts to recognize a
psychotherapist privilege under Rule 501 is confirmed by thefact that all 50 States and the District of Columbia have
enacted into law some form of psychotherapist privilege.11We have previously observed that the policy decisions of the

recognize a new privilege or amend the coverage of an exist-ing one. See

Trammel, 445 U. S., at 48-50; United States v.
Gillock, 445 U. S. 360, 368, n. 8 (1980). Because state legis-latures are fully aware of the need to protect the integrity

of the factfinding functions of their courts, the existence of a
consensus among the States indicates that "reason and expe-rience" support recognition of the privilege. In addition,

given the importance of the patient's understanding that hercommunications with her therapist will not be publicly disclosed, any State's promise of confidentiality would have lit-tle value if the patient were aware that the privilege would
not be honored in a federal court.12 Denial of the federalprivilege therefore would frustrate the purposes of the state
legislation that was enacted to foster these confidentialcommunications.

It is of no consequence that recognition of the privilege inthe vast majority of States is the product of legislative action
rather than judicial decision. Although common-law rulings
may once have been the primary source of new developments
in federal privilege law, that is no longer the case. In Funk
v. United States, 290 U. S. 371 (1933), we recognized that it
is appropriate to treat a consistent body of policy determinations by state legislatures as reflecting both "reason" and
"experience." Id., at 376-381. That rule is properly respectful of the States and at the same time reflects the fact
that once a state legislature has enacted a privilege there
is no longer an opportunity for common-law creation of the
protection. The history of the psychotherapist privilege
illustrates the latter point. In 1972 the members of the

to the patient "the relevant limits on confidentiality." See American Psychological Association, Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of
Conduct, Standard 5.01 (Dec. 1992). See also National Federation of Societies for Clinical Social Work, Code of Ethics V(a) (May 1988); American

14 JAFFEE v. REDMOND

Opinion of the Court
Judicial Conference Advisory Committee noted that thecommon law "had indicated a disposition to recognize a

psychotherapist-patient privilege when legislatures beganmoving into the field." Proposed Rules, 56 F. R. D., at 242
(citation omitted). The present unanimous acceptance of theprivilege shows that the state lawmakers moved quickly.
That the privilege may have developed faster legislativelythan it would have in the courts demonstrates only that the
States rapidly recognized the wisdom of the rule as the fieldof psychotherapy developed.

13

The uniform judgment of the States is reinforced by thefact that a psychotherapist privilege was among the nine

specific privileges recommended by the Advisory Committeein its proposed privilege rules. In

United States v. Gillock,445 U. S., at 367-368, our holding that Rule 501 did not include a state legislative privilege relied, in part, on the factthat no such privilege was included in the Advisory Commit13 Petitioner acknowledges that all 50 state legislatures favor a psychotherapist privilege. She nevertheless discounts the relevance of the state
privilege statutes by pointing to divergence among the States concerning
the types of therapy relationships protected and the exceptions recognized. A small number of state statutes, for example, grant the privilege
only to psychiatrists and psychologists, while most apply the protection
more broadly. Compare Haw. Rules Evid. 504, 504.1 and N. D. Rule Evid.
503 (privilege extends to physicians and psychotherapists), with Ariz. Rev.
Stat. Ann. $ 32-3283 (1992) (privilege covers "behavioral health professional[s]"); Tex. Rule Civ. Evid. 510(a)(1) (privilege extends to persons "licensed or certified by the State of Texas in the diagnosis, evaluation or
treatment of any mental or emotional disorder" or "involved in the treatment or examination of drug abusers"); Utah Rule Evid. 506 (privilege
protects confidential communications made to marriage and family therapists, professional counselors, and psychiatric mental health nurse specialists). The range of exceptions recognized by the States is similarly
varied. Compare Ark. Code Ann. $ 17-46-107 (1987) (narrow exceptions);
Haw. Rules Evid. 504, 504.1 (same), with Cal. Evid. Code Ann. $$ 1016-
1027 (West 1995) (broad exceptions); R. I. Gen. Laws $ 5-37.3-4 (1995)
(same). These variations in the scope of the protection are too limited to
undermine the force of the States' unanimous judgment that some form of
psychotherapist privilege is appropriate.

tee's draft. The reasoning in Gillock thus supports theopposite conclusion in this case. In rejecting the proposed

draft that had specifically identified each privilege rule andsubstituting the present more open-ended Rule 501, the Senate Judiciary Committee explicitly stated that its action"should not be understood as disapproving any recognition
of a psychiatrist-patient . . . privileg[e] contained in the[proposed] rules." S. Rep. No. 93-1277, at 13.

Because we agree with the judgment of the state legisla-tures and the Advisory Committee that a psychotherapistpatient privilege will serve a "public good transcending thenormally predominant principle of utilizing all rational
means for ascertaining truth," Trammel, 445 U. S., at 50, wehold that confidential communications between a licensed
psychotherapist and her patients in the course of diagnosisor treatment are protected from compelled disclosure under
Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.14

IV
All agree that a psychotherapist privilege covers con-fidential communications made to licensed psychiatrists and

psychologists. We have no hesitation in concluding in thiscase that the federal privilege should also extend to confidential communications made to licensed social workers inthe course of psychotherapy. The reasons for recognizing a
privilege for treatment by psychiatrists and psychologistsapply with equal force to treatment by a clinical social
worker such as Karen Beyer.15 Today, social workers pro14 Like other testimonial privileges, the patient may of course waive
the protection.

15 If petitioner had filed her complaint in an Illinois state court, respondents' claim of privilege would surely have been upheld, at least with respect to the state wrongful-death action. An Illinois statute provides
that conversations between a therapist and her patients are privileged
from compelled disclosure in any civil or criminal proceeding. Ill. Comp.
Stat., ch. 740, $ 110/10 (1994). The term "therapist" is broadly defined
to encompass a number of licensed professionals including social work518us1$69i 05-19-99 16:33:55 PAGES OPINPGT

vide a significant amount of mental health treatment. See,
e. g., U. S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Center for
Mental Health Services, Mental Health, United States, 1994,
pp. 85-87, 107-114; Brief for National Association of Social
Workers et al. as Amici Curiae 5-7 (citing authorities).
Their clients often include the poor and those of modest
means who could not afford the assistance of a psychiatrist
or psychologist, id., at 6-7 (citing authorities), but whose
counseling sessions serve the same public goals.16 Perhaps
in recognition of these circumstances, the vast majority of
States explicitly extend a testimonial privilege to licensed

ers. Ch. 740, $ 110/2. Karen Beyer, having satisfied the strict standards
for licensure, qualifies as a clinical social worker in Illinois. 51 F. 3d 1346,
1358, n. 19 (CA7 1995).

Indeed, if only a state-law claim had been asserted in federal court, the
second sentence in Rule 501 would have extended the privilege to that
proceeding. We note that there is disagreement concerning the proper
rule in cases such as this in which both federal and state claims are asserted in federal court and relevant evidence would be privileged under
state law but not under federal law. See C. Wright & K. Graham, 23
Federal Practice and Procedure $ 5434 (1980). Because the parties do not
raise this question and our resolution of the case does not depend on it,
we express no opinion on the matter.

16 The Judicial Conference Advisory Committee's proposed psychotherapist privilege defined psychotherapists as psychologists and medical doctors who provide mental health services. Proposed Rules, 56 F. R. D., at
240. This limitation in the 1972 recommendation does not counsel against
recognition of a privilege for social workers practicing psychotherapy. In
the quarter century since the Committee adopted its recommendations,
much has changed in the domains of social work and psychotherapy. See
generally Brief for National Association of Social Workers et al. as Amici
Curiae 5-13 (and authorities cited). While only 12 States regulated social
workers in 1972, all 50 do today. See American Association of State Social Work Boards, Social Work Laws and Board Regulations: A State Comparison Study 29, 31 (1996). Over the same period, the relative portion
of therapeutic services provided by social workers has increased substantially. See U. S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Center for Mental
Health Services, Mental Health, United States, 1994, pp. 85-87, 107-114.

social workers.17 We therefore agree with the Court of
Appeals that "[d]rawing a distinction between the counseling provided by costly psychotherapists and the counseling
provided by more readily accessible social workers serves
no discernible public purpose." 51 F. 3d, at 1358, n. 19.

We part company with the Court of Appeals on a separate
point. We reject the balancing component of the privilege
implemented by that court and a small number of States.18
Making the promise of confidentiality contingent upon a trial
judge's later evaluation of the relative importance of the patient's interest in privacy and the evidentiary need for disclosure would eviscerate the effectiveness of the privilege. As

we explained in Upjohn, if the purpose of the privilege is tobe served, the participants in the confidential conversation

"must be able to predict with some degree of certaintywhether particular discussions will be protected. An uncertain privilege, or one which purports to be certain but re-sults in widely varying applications by the courts, is little
better than no privilege at all." 449 U. S., at 393.These considerations are all that is necessary for decision
of this case. A rule that authorizes the recognition of newprivileges on a case-by-case basis makes it appropriate to
define the details of new privileges in a like manner. Be-cause this is the first case in which we have recognized a
psychotherapist privilege, it is neither necessary nor feasibleto delineate its full contours in a way that would "govern all
conceivable future questions in this area." Id., at 386.19

probative evidence--or at least every one categorical enoughto achieve its announced policy objective. In the case of

some of these rules, such as the one excluding confessionsthat have not been properly "Mirandized," see

Miranda v.
Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), the victim of the injustice is
always the impersonal State or the faceless "public at large."For the rule proposed here, the victim is more likely to be

some individual who is prevented from proving a validclaim--or (worse still) prevented from establishing a valid
defense. The latter is particularly unpalatable for thosewho love justice, because it causes the courts of law not
merely to let stand a wrong, but to become themselves the
instruments of wrong.

In the past, this Court has well understood that the particular value the courts are distinctively charged with preserving--justice--is severely harmed by contravention of "the
fundamental principle that ` "the public . . . has a right to
every man's evidence." ' " Trammel v. United States, 445
U. S. 40, 50 (1980) (citation omitted). Testimonial privileges,
it has said, "are not lightly created nor expansively construed, for they are in derogation of the search for truth."
United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, 710 (1974) (emphasis
added). Adherence to that principle has caused us, in the
Rule 501 cases we have considered to date, to reject new
privileges, see University of Pennsylvania v. EEOC, 493
U. S. 182 (1990) (privilege against disclosure of academic peer
review materials); United States v. Gillock, 445 U. S. 360
(1980) (privilege against disclosure of "legislative acts" by
member of state legislature), and even to construe narrowly
the scope of existing privileges, see, e. g., United States v.
Zolin, 491 U. S. 554, 568-570 (1989) (permitting in camera
review of documents alleged to come within crime-fraud exception to attorney-client privilege); Trammel, supra (holding that voluntary testimony by spouse is not covered by

ing a privilege that is new, vast, and ill defined. I respect-fully dissent.

I
The case before us involves confidential communicationsmade by a police officer to a state-licensed clinical social

worker in the course of psychotherapeutic counseling. Be-fore proceeding to a legal analysis of the case, I must observe
that the Court makes its task deceptively simple by the man-ner in which it proceeds. It begins by characterizing the
issue as "whether it is appropriate for federal courts to rec-ognize a `psychotherapist privilege,' " ante, at 4, and devotes
almost all of its opinion to that question. Having answeredthat question (to its satisfaction) in the affirmative, it then
devotes less than a page of text to answering in the affirma-tive the small remaining question whether "the federal privilege should also extend to confidential communications madeto licensed social workers in the course of psychotherapy,"
ante, at 15.Of course the prototypical evidentiary privilege analogous
to the one asserted here--the lawyer-client privilege--is notidentified by the broad area of advice giving practiced by the
person to whom the privileged communication is given, butrather by the

professional status of that person. Hence, itseems a long step from a lawyer-client privilege to a tax

advisor-client or accountant-client privilege. But if one re-characterizes it as a "legal advisor" privilege, the extension
seems like the most natural thing in the world. That is theillusion the Court has produced here: It first frames an
overly general question ("Should there be a psychotherapistprivilege?") that can be answered in the negative only by
excluding from protection office consultations with profes-sional psychiatrists (i. e., doctors) and clinical psychologists.
And then, having answered that in the affirmative, it comesto the only question that the facts of this case present
("Should there be a social worker-client privilege with re-gard to psychotherapeutic counseling?") with the answer

Scalia, J., dissenting
seemingly a foregone conclusion. At that point, to concludeagainst the privilege one must subscribe to the difficult proposition, "Yes, there is a psychotherapist privilege, but not ifthe psychotherapist is a social worker."

Relegating the question actually posed by this case to anafterthought makes the impossible possible in a number of
wonderful ways. For example, it enables the Court to treatthe Proposed Federal Rules of Evidence developed in 1972
by the Judicial Conference Advisory Committee as strongsupport for its holding, whereas they in fact counsel clearly
and directly against it. The Committee did indeed recom-mend a "psychotherapist privilege" of sorts; but more precisely, and more relevantly, it recommended a privilege forpsychotherapy conducted by "a person authorized to practice
medicine" or "a person licensed or certified as a psycholo-gist," Proposed Rule of Evidence 504, 56 F. R. D. 183, 240
(1972), which is to say that it recommended against the priv-ilege at issue here. That condemnation is obscured, and
even converted into an endorsement, by pushing a "psycho-therapist privilege" into the center ring. The Proposed
Rule figures prominently in the Court's explanation of whythat privilege deserves recognition,

ante, at 13-15, and isignored in the single page devoted to the sideshow which

happens to be the issue presented for decision, ante, at 15-16.This is the most egregious and readily explainable example of how the Court's misdirection of its analysis makes thedifficult seem easy; others will become apparent when I give
the social-worker question the fuller consideration it de-serves. My initial point, however, is that the Court's very
methodology--giving serious consideration only to the moregeneral, and much easier, question--is in violation of our
duty to proceed cautiously when erecting barriers betweenus and the truth.

II
To say that the Court devotes the bulk of its opinion to themuch easier question of psychotherapist-patient privilege is

Scalia, J., dissenting
not to say that its answer to that question is convincing. Atbottom, the Court's decision to recognize such a privilege is

based on its view that "successful [psychotherapeutic] treat-ment" serves "important private interests" (namely, those of
patients undergoing psychotherapy) as well as the "public
good" of "[t]he mental health of our citizenry." Ante, at 10-11. I have no quarrel with these premises. Effective psychotherapy undoubtedly is beneficial to individuals withmental problems, and surely serves some larger social interest in maintaining a mentally stable society. But merelymentioning these values does not answer the critical question: Are they of such importance, and is the contribution of
psychotherapy to them so distinctive, and is the application
of normal evidentiary rules so destructive to psychotherapy,
as to justify making our federal courts occasional instruments of injustice? On that central question I find the
Court's analysis insufficiently convincing to satisfy the high
standard we have set for rules that "are in derogation of the
search for truth." Nixon, 418 U. S., at 710.

When is it, one must wonder, that the psychotherapist
came to play such an indispensable role in the maintenance
of the citizenry's mental health? For most of history, men
and women have worked out their difficulties by talking to,
inter alios, parents, siblings, best friends, and bartenders--
none of whom was awarded a privilege against testifying in
court. Ask the average citizen: Would your mental health
be more significantly impaired by preventing you from
seeing a psychotherapist, or by preventing you from getting
advice from your mom? I have little doubt what the answer
would be. Yet there is no mother-child privilege.

How likely is it that a person will be deterred from seeking
psychological counseling, or from being completely truthful
in the course of such counseling, because of fear of later disclosure in litigation? And even more pertinent to today's
decision, to what extent will the evidentiary privilege reduce
that deterrent? The Court does not try to answer the first of

Scalia, J., dissenting
these questions; and it cannot possibly have any notion ofwhat the answer is to the second, since that depends entirely

upon the scope of the privilege, which the Court amazinglyfinds it "neither necessary nor feasible to delineate,"

ante,
at 18. If, for example, the psychotherapist can give the
patient no more assurance than "A court will not be able tomake me disclose what you tell me, unless you tell me about

a harmful act," I doubt whether there would be much benefitfrom the privilege at all. That is not a fanciful example, at
least with respect to extension of the psychotherapist privi-lege to social workers. See Del. Code Ann., Tit. 24, $ 3913(2)
(1987); Idaho Code $ 54-3213(2) (1994).

Even where it is certain that absence of the psychotherapist privilege will inhibit disclosure of the information, it is
not clear to me that that is an unacceptable state of affairs.
Let us assume the very worst in the circumstances of the
present case: that to be truthful about what was troubling
her, the police officer who sought counseling would have to
confess that she shot without reason, and wounded an innocent man. If (again to assume the worst) such an act constituted the crime of negligent wounding under Illinois law, the
officer would of course have the absolute right not to admit
that she shot without reason in criminal court. But I see
no reason why she should be enabled both not to admit it in
criminal court (as a good citizen should), and to get the benefits of psychotherapy by admitting it to a therapist who cannot tell anyone else. And even less reason why she should
be enabled to deny her guilt in the criminal trial--or in a
civil trial for negligence--while yet obtaining the benefits of
psychotherapy by confessing guilt to a social worker who
cannot testify. It seems to me entirely fair to say that if she
wishes the benefits of telling the truth she must also accept
the adverse consequences. To be sure, in most cases the
statements to the psychotherapist will be only marginally
relevant, and one of the purposes of the privilege (though
not one relied upon by the Court) may be simply to spare

patients needless intrusion upon their privacy, and to sparepsychotherapists needless expenditure of their time in

deposition and trial. But surely this can be achieved bymeans short of excluding even evidence that is of the most
direct and conclusive effect.

The Court confidently asserts that not much truth-findingcapacity would be destroyed by the privilege anyway, since

"[w]ithout a privilege, much of the desirable evidence towhich litigants such as petitioner seek access . . . is unlikely
to come into being." Ante, at 12. If that is so, how comepsychotherapy got to be a thriving practice before the "psychotherapist privilege" was invented? Were the patients
paying money to lie to their analysts all those years? Of
course the evidence-generating effect of the privilege (if any)
depends entirely upon its scope, which the Court steadfastly
declines to consider. And even if one assumes that scope to
be the broadest possible, is it really true that most, or even
many, of those who seek psychological counseling have the
worry of litigation in the back of their minds? I doubt that,
and the Court provides no evidence to support it.

The Court suggests one last policy justification: since psychotherapist privilege statutes exist in all the States, the
failure to recognize a privilege in federal courts "would frustrate the purposes of the state legislation that was enacted
to foster these confidential communications." Ante, at 13.
This is a novel argument indeed. A sort of inverse preemption: The truth-seeking functions of federal courts must
be adjusted so as not to conflict with the policies of the
States. This reasoning cannot be squared with Gillock,
which declined to recognize an evidentiary privilege for Tennessee legislators in federal prosecutions, even though the
Tennessee Constitution guaranteed it in state criminal proceedings. Gillock, 445 U. S., at 368. Moreover, since, as I
shall discuss, state policies regarding the psychotherapist
privilege vary considerably from State to State, no uniform
federal policy can possibly honor most of them. If further518us1$69k 05-19-99 16:33:55 PAGES OPINPGT

ance of state policies is the name of the game, rules of privilege in federal courts should vary from State to State, a` la
Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938).

The Court's failure to put forward a convincing justification of its own could perhaps be excused if it were relying
upon the unanimous conclusion of state courts in the reasoned development of their common law. It cannot do that,
since no State has such a privilege apart from legislation.1

1 The Court observes: "In 1972 the members of the Judicial Conference
Advisory Committee noted that the common law `had indicated a disposition to recognize a psychotherapist-patient privilege when legislatures
began moving into the field.' Proposed Rules, 56 F. R. D., at 242 (citation
omitted)." Ante, at 13-14. The sole support the Committee invoked was
a student Note entitled Confidential Communications to a Psychotherapist:
A New Testimonial Privilege, 47 Nw. U. L. Rev. 384 (1952). That source,
in turn, cites (and discusses) a single case recognizing a common-law psychotherapist privilege: the unpublished opinion of a judge of the Circuit
Court of Cook County, Illinois, Binder v. Ruvell, No. 52-C-2535 (June 24,
1952)--which, in turn, cites no other cases.

I doubt whether the Court's failure to provide more substantial support
for its assertion stems from want of trying. Respondents and all of their
amici pointed us to only four other state-court decisions supposedly adopting a common-law psychotherapist privilege. See Brief for American
Psychiatric Association et al. as Amici Curiae 8, n. 5; Brief for American
Psychoanalytic Association et al. as Amici Curiae 15-16; Brief for American Psychological Association as Amicus Curiae 8. It is not surprising
that the Court thinks it not worth the trouble to cite them: (1) In In re
"B," 482 Pa. 471, 394 A. 2d 419 (1978), the opinions of four of the seven
justices explicitly rejected a nonstatutory privilege; and the two justices
who did recognize one recognized, not a common-law privilege, but rather
(mirabile dictu) a privilege "constitutionally based," "emanat[ing] from
the penumbras of the various guarantees of the Bill of Rights, . . . as well
as from the guarantees of the Constitution of this Commonwealth." Id.,
at 484, 394 A. 2d, at 425. (2) Allred v. State, 554 P. 2d 411 (Alaska 1976),
held that no privilege was available in the case before the court, so what
it says about the existence of a common-law privilege is the purest dictum.
(3) Falcon v. Alaska Pub. Offices Comm'n, 570 P. 2d 469 (1977), a later
Alaska Supreme Court case, proves the last statement. It rejected the
claim by a physician that he did not have to disclose the names of his
patients, even though some of the physician's practice consisted of psycho518us1$69k 05-19-99 16:33:55 PAGES OPINPGT

Scalia, J., dissenting
What it relies upon, instead, is "the fact that all 50 Statesand the District of Columbia have [1]

enacted into law [2]
some form of psychotherapist privilege." Ante, at 12 (em-phasis added). Let us consider both the verb and its object:

The fact [1] that all 50 States have enacted this privilege
argues not for, but against, our adopting the privilege judi-cially. At best it suggests that the matter has been found

not to lend itself to judicial treatment--perhaps because thepros and cons of adopting the privilege, or of giving it one
or another shape, are not that clear; or perhaps because therapidly evolving uses of psychotherapy demand a flexibility
that only legislation can provide. At worst it suggests thatthe privilege commends itself only to decisionmaking bodies
in which reason is tempered, so to speak, by political pressure from organized interest groups (such as psychologistsand social workers), and decisionmaking bodies that are not

overwhelmingly concerned (as courts of law are and should
be) with justice.

And the phrase [2] "some form of psychotherapist privilege" covers a multitude of difficulties. The Court concedes
that there is "divergence among the States concerning the
types of therapy relationships protected and the exceptions
recognized." Ante, at 14, n. 13. To rest a newly announced
federal common-law psychotherapist privilege, assertable

therapy; it made no mention of Allred's dictum that there was a commonlaw psychiatrist-patient privilege (though if that existed it would seem
relevant), and cited Allred only for the proposition that there was no statutory privilege, 570 P. 2d, at 473, n. 12. And finally, (4) State v. Evans, 104
Ariz. 434, 454 P. 2d 976 (1969), created a limited privilege, applicable to
court-ordered examinations to determine competency to stand trial, which
tracked a privilege that had been legislatively created after the defendant's examination.

In light of this dearth of case support--from all the courts of 50 States,
down to the county-court level--it seems to me the Court's assertion
should be revised to read: "The common law had indicated scant disposition to recognize a psychotherapist-patient privilege when (or even after)
legislatures began moving into the field."

from this day forward in all federal courts, upon "the States'
unanimous judgment that some form of psychotherapist
privilege is appropriate," ibid. (emphasis added), is rather
like announcing a new, immediately applicable, federal common law of torts, based upon the States' "unanimous judgment" that some form of tort law is appropriate. In the one
case as in the other, the state laws vary to such a degree
that the parties and lower federal judges confronted by the
new "common law" have barely a clue as to what its content
might be.

III

Turning from the general question that was not involved
in this case to the specific one that is: The Court's conclusion
that a social-worker psychotherapeutic privilege deserves
recognition is even less persuasive. In approaching this
question, the fact that five of the state legislatures that have
seen fit to enact "some form" of psychotherapist privilege
have elected not to extend any form of privilege to social
workers, see ante, at 17, n. 17, ought to give one pause. So
should the fact that the Judicial Conference Advisory Committee was similarly discriminating in its conferral of the
proposed Rule 504 privilege, see supra, at 21. The Court,
however, has "no hesitation in concluding . . . that the federal
privilege should also extend" to social workers, ante, at 15--
and goes on to prove that by polishing off the reasoned analysis with a topic sentence and two sentences of discussion,
as follows (omitting citations and nongermane footnote):

"The reasons for recognizing a privilege for treatment
by psychiatrists and psychologists apply with equal
force to treatment by a clinical social worker such as
Karen Beyer. Today, social workers provide a significant amount of mental health treatment. Their clients
often include the poor and those of modest means who
could not afford the assistance of a psychiatrist or psy518us1$69k 05-19-99 16:33:55 PAGES OPINPGT

Scalia, J., dissenting
chologist, but whose counseling sessions serve the samepublic goals." Ante, at 15-16.

So much for the rule that privileges are to be narrowlyconstrued.

Of course this brief analysis--like the earlier, more exten-sive, discussion of the general psychotherapist privilege--
contains no explanation of why the psychotherapy providedby social workers is a public good of such transcendent
importance as to be purchased at the price of occasionalinjustice. Moreover, it considers only the respects in which
social workers providing therapeutic services are similar tolicensed psychiatrists and psychologists; not a word about
the respects in which they are different. A licensed psychi-atrist or psychologist is an expert in psychotherapy--and
that may suffice (though I think it not so clear that this Courtshould make the judgment) to justify the use of extraordinary means to encourage counseling with him, as opposedto counseling with one's rabbi, minister, family, or friends.
One must presume that a social worker does not bring thisgreatly heightened degree of skill to bear, which is alone a
reason for not encouraging that consultation as generously.Does a social worker bring to bear at least a significantly
heightened degree of skill--more than a minister or rabbi,for example? I have no idea, and neither does the Court.
The social worker in the present case, Karen Beyer, was a"licensed clinical social worker" in Illinois, App. 18, a job title
whose training requirements consist of a "master's degree insocial work from an approved program," and "3,000 hours
of satisfactory, supervised clinical professional experience."Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 225, $ 20/9 (1994). It is not clear that
the degree in social work requires any training in psycho-therapy. The "clinical professional experience" apparently
will impart some such training, but only of the vaguest sort,judging from the Illinois Code's definition of "[c]linical social
work practice," viz., "the providing of mental health servicesfor the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of mental and

emotional disorders in individuals, families and groups basedon knowledge and theory of psychosocial development, behavior, psychopathology, unconscious motivation, interper-sonal relationships, and environmental stress." Ch. 225,

$ 20/3(5). But the rule the Court announces today--like the
Illinois evidentiary privilege which that rule purports to re-spect, ch. 225, $ 20/16

2--is not limited to "licensed clinical

social workers," but includes all "licensed social worker[s].""Licensed social worker[s]" may also provide "mental health

services" as described in $ 20/3(5), so long as it is done undersupervision of a licensed clinical social worker. And the
training requirement for a "licensed social worker" consistsof either (a) "a degree from a graduate program of social
work" approved by the State, or (b) "a degree in social workfrom an undergraduate program" approved by the State,
plus "3 years of supervised professional experience." Ch.
225, $ 20/9A. With due respect, it does not seem to me that
any of this training is comparable in its rigor (or indeed in
the precision of its subject) to the training of the other experts (lawyers) to whom this Court has accorded a privilege,
or even of the experts (psychiatrists and psychologists) to
whom the Advisory Committee and this Court proposed
extension of a privilege in 1972. Of course these are
only Illinois' requirements for "social workers." Those of

2 Section 20/16 is the provision of the Illinois statutes cited by the Court
to show that Illinois has "explicitly extend[ed] a testimonial privilege to
licensed social workers." Ante, at 16-17, and n. 17. The Court elsewhere observes that Redmond's communications to Beyer would have
been privileged in state court under another provision of the Illinois statutes, the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Confidentiality
Act, Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 740, $ 110/10 (1994). Ante, at 15-16, n. 15. But
the privilege conferred by $ 110/10 extends to an even more ill-defined
class: not only to licensed social workers, but to all social workers, to
nurses, and indeed to "any other person not prohibited by law from providing [mental health or developmental disabilities] services or from holding
himself out as a therapist if the recipient reasonably believes that such
person is permitted to do so." Ch. 740, $ 110/2.

Scalia, J., dissenting
other States, for all we know, may be even less demanding.Indeed, I am not even sure there is a nationally accepted

definition of "social worker," as there is of psychiatrist andpsychologist. It seems to me quite irresponsible to extend
the so-called "psychotherapist privilege" to all licensed
social workers, nationwide, without exploring these issues.Another critical distinction between psychiatrists and psychologists, on the one hand, and social workers, on the other,is that the former professionals, in their consultations with
patients, do nothing but psychotherapy. Social workers, onthe other hand, interview people for a multitude of reasons.
The Illinois definition of "[l]icensed social worker," for exam-ple, is as follows:

"Licensed social worker" means a person who holdsa license authorizing the practice of social work, which
includes social services to individuals, groups or commu-nities in any one or more of the fields of social casework,
social group work, community organization for social
welfare, social work research, social welfare administra-tion or social work education." Ch. 225, $ 20/3(9).

Thus, in applying the "social worker" variant of the "psychotherapist" privilege, it will be necessary to determinewhether the information provided to the social worker was

provided to him in his capacity as a psychotherapist, or in
his capacity as an administrator of social welfare, a commu-nity organizer, etc. Worse still, if the privilege is to have

its desired effect (and is not to mislead the client), it willpresumably be necessary for the social caseworker to advise,
as the conversation with his welfare client proceeds, which
portions are privileged and which are not.

Having concluded its three sentences of reasoned analysis,
the Court then invokes, as it did when considering the psychotherapist privilege, the "experience" of the States--once
again an experience I consider irrelevant (if not counterindicative) because it consists entirely of legislation rather

than common-law decision. It says that "the vast majorityof States explicitly extend a testimonial privilege to licensed

social workers." Ante, at 16-17. There are two elementsof this impressive statistic, however, that the Court does
not reveal.First--and utterly conclusive of the irrelevance of this
supposed consensus to the question before us--the majorityof the States that accord a privilege to social workers do
not do so as a subpart of a "psychotherapist" privilege. Theprivilege applies to

all confidences imparted to social work-ers, and not just those provided in the course of psychotherapy.3 In Oklahoma, for example, the social-worker-privilegestatute prohibits a licensed social worker from disclosing,
or being compelled to disclose, "any information acquiredfrom persons consulting the licensed social worker in his or
her professional capacity" (with certain exceptions to bediscussed

infra, at 33). Okla. Stat., Tit. 59, $ 1261.6 (1991)(emphasis added). The social worker's "professional capacity" is expansive, for the "[P]ractice of social work" inOklahoma is defined as:

professional application of social work values, principles
and techniques in areas such as clinical social work, social service administration, social planning, social work
consultation and social work research to one or more of
the following ends: Helping people obtain tangible services; counseling with individuals, families and groups;
helping communities or groups provide or improve social
and health services; and participating in relevant social
action. The practice of social work requires knowledge
of human development and behavior; of social economic
and cultural institutions and forces; and of the interaction of all of these factors. Social work practice
includes the teaching of relevant subject matter and of
conducting research into problems of human behavior
and conflict." Tit. 59, $ 1250.1(2).

Thus, in Oklahoma, as in most other States having a socialworker privilege, it is not a subpart or even a derivative of
the psychotherapist privilege, but rather a piece of special
legislation similar to that achieved by many other groups,
from accountants, see, e. g., Miss. Code Ann. $ 73-33-16(2)
(1995) (certified public accountant "shall not be required by
any court of this state to disclose, and shall not voluntarily
disclose," client information), to private detectives, see, e. g.,
Mich. Comp. Laws $ 338.840(2) (1979) ("Any communications
. . . furnished by a professional man or client to a [licensed
private detective], or any information secured in connection
with an assignment for a client, shall be deemed privileged
with the same authority and dignity as are other privileged
communications recognized by the courts of this state").4
These social-worker statutes give no support, therefore, to

4 These ever-multiplying evidentiary-privilege statutes, which the Court
today emulates, recall us to the original meaning of the word "privilege."
It is a composite derived from the Latin words "privus" and "lex": private law.

the theory (importance of psychotherapy) upon which theCourt rests its disposition.

Second, the Court does not reveal the enormous degree ofdisagreement among the States as to the scope of the privilege. It concedes that the laws of four States are subject to
such gaping exceptions that they are " `little better than noprivilege at all,' "

ante, at 17, 18, and n. 18, so that they
should more appropriately be categorized with the fiveStates whose laws contradict the action taken today. I

would add another State to those whose privilege is illusory.See Wash. Rev. Code $ 18.19.180 (1994) (disclosure of information required "[i]n response to a subpoena from a court of
law"). In adopting any sort of a social-worker privilege,
then, the Court can at most claim that it is following the
legislative "experience" of 40 States, and contradicting the
"experience" of 10.

But turning to those States that do have an appreciable
privilege of some sort, the diversity is vast. In Illinois
and Wisconsin, the social-worker privilege does not apply
when the confidential information pertains to homicide, see
Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 740, $ 110/10(a)(9) (1994); Wis. Stat.

$ 905.04(4)(d) (1993-1994), and in the District of Columbia
when it pertains to any crime "inflicting injuries" upon persons, see D. C. Code Ann. $ 14-307(a)(1) (1995). In Missouri,
the privilege is suspended as to information that pertains to
a criminal act, see Mo. Rev. Stat. $ 337.636(2) (1994), and in
Texas when the information is sought in any criminal prosecution, compare Tex. Rule Civ. Evid. 510(d) with Tex. Rule
Crim. Evid. 501 et seq. In Kansas and Oklahoma, the privilege yields when the information pertains to "violations of
any law," see Kan. Stat. Ann. $ 65-6315(a)(2) (Supp. 1990);
Okla. Stat., Tit. 59, $ 1261.6(2) (1991); in Indiana, when it reveals a "serious harmful act," see Ind. Code $ 25-23.6-6-1(2)
(1993); and in Delaware and Idaho, when it pertains to
any "harmful act," see Del. Code Ann., Tit. 24, $ 3913(2)
(1987); Idaho Code $ 54-3213(2) (1994). In Oregon, a state518us1$69k 05-19-99 16:33:55 PAGES OPINPGT

employed social worker like Karen Beyer loses the privilege
where her supervisor determines that her testimony "is necessary in the performance of the duty of the social worker
as a public employee." See Ore. Rev. Stat. $ 40.250(5) (1991).
In South Carolina, a social worker is forced to disclose confidences "when required by statutory law or by court order
for good cause shown to the extent that the patient's care
and treatment or the nature and extent of his mental illness
or emotional condition are reasonably at issue in a proceeding." See S. C. Code Ann. $ 19-11-95(D)(1) (Supp. 1995).
The majority of social-worker-privilege States declare the
privilege inapplicable to information relating to child abuse.5
And the States that do not fall into any of the above categories provide exceptions for commitment proceedings, for proceedings in which the patient relies on his mental or emotional condition as an element of his claim or defense, or for
communications made in the course of a court-ordered examination of the mental or emotional condition of the patient.6

Thus, although the Court is technically correct that "thevast majority of States explicitly extend a testimonial privilege to licensed social workers," ante, at 16-17, that uniform-ity exists only at the most superficial level. No State has
adopted the privilege without restriction; the nature of therestrictions varies enormously from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; and 10 States, I reiterate, effectively reject the privi-lege entirely. It is fair to say that there is scant national
consensus even as to the propriety of a social-worker psycho-therapist privilege, and none whatever as to its appropriate
scope. In other words, the state laws to which the Courtappeals for support demonstrate most convincingly that
adoption of a social-worker psychotherapist privilege is a jobfor Congress.

The question before us today is not whether there shouldbe an evidentiary privilege for social workers providing therapeutic services. Perhaps there should. But the questionbefore us is whether (1) the need for that privilege is so clear,
and (2) the desirable contours of that privilege are so evi-dent, that it is appropriate for this Court to craft it in
common-law fashion, under Rule 501. Even if we werewriting on a clean slate, I think the answer to that question would be clear. But given our extensive precedent tothe effect that new privileges "in derogation of the search
for truth" "are not lightly created," United States v. Nixon,418 U. S., at 710, the answer the Court gives today is
inexplicable.In its consideration of this case, the Court was the beneficiary of no fewer than 14 amicus briefs supporting respond-ents, most of which came from such organizations as the
American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychoana-lytic Association, the American Association of State Social
Work Boards, the Employee Assistance Professionals Asso-ciation, Inc., the American Counseling Association, and the

cus brief was filed in support of petitioner. That is no sur-prise. There is no self-interested organization out there

devoted to pursuit of the truth in the federal courts. Theexpectation is, however, that this Court will have that interest prominently--indeed, primarily--in mind. Today wehave failed that expectation, and that responsibility. It is
no small matter to say that, in some cases, our federal courtswill be the tools of injustice rather than unearth the truth
where it is available to be found. The common law has iden-tified a few instances where that is tolerable. Perhaps Congress may conclude that it is also tolerable for the purposeof encouraging psychotherapy by social workers. But that
conclusion assuredly does not burst upon the mind with suchclarity that a judgment in favor of suppressing the truth
ought to be pronounced by this honorable Court. I respect-fully dissent.

Syllabus

MONTANA v. EGELHOFF
certiorari to the supreme court of montana

No. 95-566. Argued March 20, 1996--Decided June 13, 1996
On trial for two counts of deliberate homicide--defined by Montana law

as "purposely" or "knowingly" causing another's death--respondent
claimed that extreme intoxication had rendered him physically incapable of committing the murders and accounted for his inability to recall
the events of the night in question. After being instructed, pursuant
to Mont. Code Ann. $ 45-2-203, that respondent's "intoxicated condition" could not be considered "in determining the existence of a mental
state which is an element of the offense," the jury found respondent
guilty. In reversing, the Supreme Court of Montana reasoned that respondent had a right, under the Due Process Clause, to present and have
the jury consider "all relevant evidence" to rebut the State's evidence on
all elements of the offense charged, and that evidence of his voluntary
intoxication was "clearly relevant" to the issue whether he acted knowingly and purposely. Because $ 45-2-203 prevented the jury from considering that evidence, the court concluded that the State had been relieved of part of its burden of proof and that respondent had therefore
been denied due process.

Held: The judgment is reversed.
272 Mont. 114, 900 P. 2d 260, reversed.

Justice Scalia, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Kennedy,
and Justice Thomas, concluded that $ 45-2-203 does not violate the
Due Process Clause. Pp. 41-56.

(a) The State Supreme Court's proposition that the Due Process
Clause guarantees the right to introduce all relevant evidence is indefensible. See, e. g., Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U. S. 400, 410; Fed. Rule Evid.
403; Fed. Rule Evid. 802. The Clause does place limits upon restriction
of the right to introduce evidence, but only where the restriction "offends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience
of our people as to be ranked as fundamental." See Patterson v. New
York, 432 U. S. 197, 201-202. Respondent has failed to meet the heavy
burden of establishing that a defendant's right to have a jury consider
voluntary intoxication evidence in determining whether he possesses
the requisite mental state is a "fundamental principle of justice." The
primary guide in making such a determination, historical practice, gives
respondent little support. It was firmly established at common law
that a defendant's voluntary intoxication provided neither an "excuse"

38 MONTANA v. EGELHOFF

Syllabus
nor a "justification" for his crimes; the common law's stern rejection of
inebriation as a defense must be understood as also precluding a defendant from arguing that, because of his intoxication, he could not have
possessed the mens rea necessary to commit the crime. The justifications for this common-law rule persist to this day, and have only been
strengthened by modern research. Although a rule allowing a jury to
consider evidence of a defendant's voluntary intoxication where relevant
to mens rea has gained considerable acceptance since the 19th century,
it is of too recent vintage, and has not received sufficiently uniform
and permanent allegiance to qualify as fundamental, especially since it
displaces a lengthy common-law tradition which remains supported by
valid justifications. Pp. 41-51.

(b) None of this Court's cases on which the Supreme Court of Montana's conclusion purportedly rested undermines the principle that a
State can limit the introduction of relevant evidence for a "valid" reason,
as Montana has. The Due Process Clause does not bar States from
making changes in their criminal law that have the effect of making
it easier for the prosecution to obtain convictions. See McMillan v.
Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 89, n. 5. Pp. 51-56.

Justice Ginsburg concluded that $ 45-2-203 should not be categorized as simply an evidentiary rule. Rather, $ 45-2-203 embodies a legislative judgment regarding the circumstances under which individuals
may be held criminally responsible for their actions. The provision
judges equally culpable a person who commits an act stone sober, and
one who engages in the same conduct after voluntary intoxication has
reduced the actor's capacity for self-control. Comprehended as a measure redefining mens rea, $ 45-2-203 encounters no constitutional shoal.
States have broad authority to define the elements of criminal offenses
in light of evolving perceptions of the extent to which moral culpability
should be a prerequisite to conviction of a crime. Defining mens rea to
eliminate the exculpatory value of voluntary intoxication does not offend
a fundamental principle of justice, given the lengthy common-law tradition, and the adherence of a significant minority of the States to that
position today. Pp. 56-61.

not be taken into consideration in determining the existenceof a mental state which is an element of [a criminal] offense."

I
In July 1992, while camping out in the Yaak region ofnorthwestern Montana to pick mushrooms, respondent made

friends with Roberta Pavola and John Christenson, whowere doing the same. On Sunday, July 12, the three sold
the mushrooms they had collected and spent the rest of theday and evening drinking, in bars and at a private party in
Troy, Montana. Some time after 9 p.m., they left the partyin Christenson's 1974 Ford Galaxy station wagon. The
drinking binge apparently continued, as respondent was seenbuying beer at 9:20 p.m. and recalled "sitting on a hill or a
bank passing a bottle of Black Velvet back and forth" withChristenson. 272 Mont. 114, 118, 900 P. 2d 260, 262 (1995).

At about midnight that night, officers of the LincolnCounty, Montana, sheriff 's department, responding to reports of a possible drunk driver, discovered Christenson'sstation wagon stuck in a ditch along U. S. Highway 2. In
the front seat were Pavola and Christenson, each dead froma single gunshot to the head. In the rear of the car lay respondent, alive and yelling obscenities. His blood-alcoholcontent measured .36 percent over one hour later. On the
floor of the car, near the brake pedal, lay respondent's .38-caliber handgun, with four loaded rounds and two empty
casings; respondent had gunshot residue on his hands.Respondent was charged with two counts of deliberate
homicide, a crime defined by Montana law as "purposely"or "knowingly" causing the death of another human being.
Mont. Code Ann. $ 45-5-102 (1995). A portion of the jurycharge, uncontested here, instructed that "[a] person acts
purposely when it is his conscious object to engage in con-duct of that nature or to cause such a result," and that "[a]
person acts knowingly when he is aware of his conduct orwhen he is aware under the circumstances his conduct consti518US1$70k 05-29-99 18:59:23 PAGES OPINPGT

tutes a crime; or, when he is aware there exists the highprobability that his conduct will cause a specific result."

App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a-29a. Respondent's defense attrial was that an unidentified fourth person must have
committed the murders; his own extreme intoxication, heclaimed, had rendered him physically incapable of committing the murders, and accounted for his inability to recall theevents of the night of July 12. Although respondent was
allowed to make this use of the evidence that he was intoxi-cated, the jury was instructed, pursuant to Mont. Code Ann.

$ 45-2-203 (1995), that it could not consider respondent's"intoxicated condition . . . in determining the existence of
a mental state which is an element of the offense." App. toPet. for Cert. 29a. The jury found respondent guilty on
both counts, and the court sentenced him to 84 years'imprisonment.

The Supreme Court of Montana reversed. It reasoned (1)that respondent "had a due process right to present and have
considered by the jury all relevant evidence to rebut theState's evidence on all elements of the offense charged," 272
Mont., at 125, 900 P. 2d, at 266, and (2) that evidence of re-spondent's voluntary intoxication was "clear[ly] . . . relevant
to the issue of whether [respondent] acted knowingly andpurposely,"

id., at 122, 900 P. 2d, at 265. Because $ 45-2-203prevented the jury from considering that evidence with regard to that issue, the court concluded that the State hadbeen "relieved of part of its burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every fact necessary to constitute the crimecharged,"

id., at 124, 900 P. 2d, at 266, and that respondenthad therefore been denied due process. We granted certiorari. 516 U. S. 1021 (1995).

II
The cornerstone of the Montana Supreme Court's judg-ment was the proposition that the Due Process Clause guarantees a defendant the right to present and have considered

518US1$70k 05-29-99 18:59:23 PAGES OPINPGT
42 MONTANA v. EGELHOFF

Opinion of Scalia, J.
by the jury "all relevant evidence to rebut the State's evi-dence on all elements of the offense charged." 272 Mont., at

125, 900 P. 2d, at 266 (emphasis added). Respondent doesnot defend this categorical rule; he acknowledges that the
right to present relevant evidence "has not been viewed asabsolute." Brief for Respondent 31. That is a wise concession, since the proposition that the Due Process Clause guar-antees the right to introduce all relevant evidence is simply
indefensible. As we have said: "The accused does not havean unfettered right to offer [evidence] that is incompetent,
privileged, or otherwise inadmissible under standard rulesof evidence."

Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U. S. 400, 410 (1988).Relevant evidence may, for example, be excluded on account

of a defendant's failure to comply with procedural require-ments. See

Michigan v. Lucas, 500 U. S. 145, 151 (1991).And any number of familiar and unquestionably constitutional evidentiary rules also authorize the exclusion of rele-vant evidence. For example, Federal (and Montana) Rule of
Evidence 403 provides: "Although relevant, evidence may beexcluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed
by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, ormisleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay,
waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evi-dence." (Emphasis added.) Hearsay rules, see Fed. Rule
Evid. 802, similarly prohibit the introduction of testimonywhich, though unquestionably relevant, is deemed insufficiently reliable.1 Of course, to say that the right to intro1 Justice O'Connor agrees that "a defendant does not enjoy an absolute right to present evidence relevant to his defense," post, at 62, and
does not dispute the validity of the evidentiary rules mentioned above.
She contends, however, that Montana's Rule is not like these because it
"places a blanket exclusion on a category of evidence that would allow the
accused to negate the offense's mental-state element." Ibid. (emphasis
added). Of course hearsay is a "category" of evidence as well; what
Justice O'Connor apparently has in mind is that this particular category relates to evidence tending to prove a particular fact. That is
indeed a distinction, but it is hard to understand why it should make

Opinion of Scalia, J.
duce relevant evidence is not absolute is not to say that theDue Process Clause places no limits upon restriction of that

right. But it is to say that the defendant asserting such alimit must sustain the usual heavy burden that a due process
claim entails:

"[P]reventing and dealing with crime is much morethe business of the States than it is of the Federal Government, and . . . we should not lightly construe theConstitution so as to intrude upon the administration of
justice by the individual States. Among other things,it is normally `within the power of the State to regulate
procedures under which its laws are carried out,' . . .and its decision in this regard is not subject to proscription under the Due Process Clause unless `it offendssome principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and
conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamen-tal.' "

Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 201-202(1977) (citations omitted).

See also Cooper v. Oklahoma, 517 U. S. 348, 355 (1996)(applying Patterson test); Marshall v. Lonberger, 459 U. S.
422, 438, n. 6 (1983) ("[T]he Due Process Clause does notpermit the federal courts to engage in a finely tuned review
of the wisdom of state evidentiary rules"). Respondent'stask, then, is to establish that a defendant's right to have a
jury consider evidence of his voluntary intoxication in deter-mining whether he possesses the requisite mental state is a
"fundamental principle of justice."Our primary guide in determining whether the principle
in question is fundamental is, of course, historical practice.
a difference. So long as the category of excluded evidence is selected on
a basis that has good and traditional policy support, it ought to be valid.

We do not entirely understand Justice O'Connor's argument that the
vice of $ 45-2-203 is that it excludes evidence "essential to the accused's
defense," post, at 64; see also post, at 72. Evidence of intoxication
is not always "essential," any more than hearsay evidence is always
"nonessential."

44 MONTANA v. EGELHOFF

Opinion of Scalia, J.
See Medina v. California, 505 U. S. 437, 446 (1992). Herethat gives respondent little support. By the laws of England, wrote Hale, the intoxicated defendant "shall have noprivilege by this voluntary contracted madness, but shall
have the same judgment as if he were in his right senses."1 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown *32-*33. According to Blackstone and Coke, the law's condemnation of those sufferingfrom

dementia affectata was harsher still: Blackstone, citingCoke, explained that the law viewed intoxication "as an aggravation of the offence, rather than as an excuse for anycriminal misbehaviour." 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries
*25-*26. This stern rejection of inebriation as a defense be-came a fixture of early American law as well. The American
editors of the 1847 edition of Hale wrote:

"Drunkenness, it was said in an early case, can never bereceived as a ground to excuse or palliate an offence:

this is not merely the opinion of a speculative philoso-pher, the argument of counsel, or the obiter dictum of a
single judge, but it is a sound and long establishedmaxim of judicial policy, from which perhaps a single
dissenting voice cannot be found. But if no other au-thority could be adduced, the uniform decisions of our
own Courts from the first establishment of the govern-ment, would constitute it now a part of the common law
of the land." 1 Hale, supra, at *32, n. 3.
In an opinion citing the foregoing passages from Blackstoneand Hale, Justice Story rejected an objection to the exclusion

of evidence of intoxication as follows:

"This is the first time, that I ever remember it to havebeen contended, that the commission of one crime was

an excuse for another. Drunkenness is a gross vice, andin the contemplation of some of our laws is a crime; and
I learned in my earlier studies, that so far from its beingin law an excuse for murder, it is rather an aggravation

of its malignity." United States v. Cornell, 25 F. Cas.650, 657-658 (No. 14,868) (CC R. I. 1820).

The historical record does not leave room for the view thatthe common law's rejection of intoxication as an "excuse" or
"justification" for crime would nonetheless permit the de-fendant to show that intoxication prevented the requisite
mens rea. Hale, Coke, and Blackstone were familiar, to saythe least, with the concept of mens rea, and acknowledged
that drunkenness "deprive[s] men of the use of reason," 1Hale,

supra, at *32; see also Blackstone, supra, at *25. Itis inconceivable that they did not realize that an offender's

drunkenness might impair his ability to form the requisiteintent; and inconceivable that their failure to note this massive exception from the general rule of disregard of intoxica-tion was an oversight. Hale's statement that a drunken offender shall have the same judgment "as if he were in hisright senses" must be understood as precluding a defendant
from arguing that, because of his intoxication, he could nothave possessed the

mens rea required to commit the crime.And the same must be said of the exemplar of the commonlaw rule cited by both Hale and Blackstone, see 1 Hale,supra, at *32; Blackstone, supra, at *26, n. w, which is Serjeant Pollard's argument to the King's Bench in Reniger v.
Fogossa, 1 Plowd. 1, 19, 75 Eng. Rep. 1, 31 (1550): "[I]f aperson that is drunk kills another, this shall be Felony, and

he shall be hanged for it, and yet he did it through Ignorance,for when he was drunk he had no Understanding nor Memory; but inasmuch as that Ignorance was occasioned by hisown Act and Folly, and he might have avoided it, he shall not
be privileged thereby." (Emphasis added.) See also Beverley's Case, 4 Co. Rep. 123b, 125a, 76 Eng. Rep. 1118, 1123(K. B. 1603) ("although he who is drunk, is for the time non

compos mentis, yet his drunkenness does not extenuate hisact or offence, nor turn to his avail" (emphasis added) (footnote omitted)).

46 MONTANA v. EGELHOFF

Opinion of Scalia, J.
Against this extensive evidence of a lengthy common-law
tradition decidedly against him, the best argument available
to respondent is the one made by his amicus and conceded
by the State: Over the course of the 19th century, courts
carved out an exception to the common law's traditional
across-the-board condemnation of the drunken offender,
allowing a jury to consider a defendant's intoxication when
assessing whether he possessed the mental state needed to
commit the crime charged, where the crime was one requiring a "specific intent." The emergence of this new rule is
often traced to an 1819 English case, in which Justice Holroyd is reported to have held that "though voluntary drunkenness cannot excuse from the commission of crime, yet
where, as on a charge of murder, the material question is,
whether an act was premeditated or done only with sudden
heat and impulse, the fact of the party being intoxicated [is]
a circumstance proper to be taken into consideration." 1 W.
Russell, Crimes and Misdemeanors *8 (citing King v. Grindley, Worcester Sum. Assizes 1819, MS). This exception was
"slow to take root," however, Hall, Intoxication and Criminal
Responsibility, 57 Harv. L. Rev. 1045, 1049 (1944), even in
England. Indeed, in the 1835 case of King v. Carroll, 7
Car. & P. 145, 147, 173 Eng. Rep. 64, 65 (N. P.), Justice Park
claimed that Holroyd had "retracted his opinion" in Grindley, and said "there is no doubt that that case is not law."
In this country, as late as 1858 the Missouri Supreme Court
could speak as categorically as this:

"To look for deliberation and forethought in a man maddened by intoxication is vain, for drunkenness has deprived him of the deliberating faculties to a greater or
less extent; and if this deprivation is to relieve him of
all responsibility or to diminish it, the great majority of
crimes committed will go unpunished. This however is
not the doctrine of the common law; and to its maxims,
based as they obviously are upon true wisdom and sound

policy, we must adhere." State v. Cross, 27 Mo. 332,338 (1858).

And as late as 1878, the Vermont Supreme Court upheld thegiving of the following instruction at a murder trial:

" `The voluntary intoxication of one who without provo-cation commits a homicide, although amounting to a
frenzy, that is, although the intoxication amounts to afrenzy, does not excuse him from the same construction
of his conduct, and the same legal inferences upon thequestion of premeditation and intent, as affecting the
grade of his crime, which are applicable to a personentirely sober.' "

State v. Tatro, 50 Vt. 483, 487 (1878).

See also Harris v. United States, 8 App. D. C. 20, 26-30(1896); Flanigan v. People, 86 N. Y. 554, 559-560 (1881);

Commonwealth v. Hawkins, 69 Mass. 463, 466 (1855); Statev. McCants, 1 Spears 384, 391-395 (S. C. 1842). Eventually,
however, the new view won out, and by the end of the 19thcentury, in most American jurisdictions, intoxication could
be considered in determining whether a defendant was capa-ble of forming the specific intent necessary to commit the
crime charged. See Hall, supra, at 1049; Hopt v. People, 104U. S. 631, 633-634 (1882) (citing cases).

On the basis of this historical record, respondent's amicusargues that "[t]he old common-law rule . . . was no longer
deeply rooted at the time the Fourteenth Amendment wasratified." Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 23. That conclusion isquestionable, but we need not pursue the point, since the
argument of amicus mistakes the nature of our inquiry. Itis not the State which bears the burden of demonstrating
that its rule is "deeply rooted," but rather respondent whomust show that the principle of procedure

violated by therule (and allegedly required by due process) is " `so rooted in

the traditions and conscience of our people as to be rankedas fundamental.' " Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S., at 202.

48 MONTANA v. EGELHOFF

Opinion of Scalia, J.
Thus, even assuming that when the Fourteenth Amendmentwas adopted the rule Montana now defends was no longer

generally applied, this only cuts off what might be called an
a fortiori argument in favor of the State. The burden remains upon respondent to show that the "new common-law"
rule--that intoxication may be considered on the question ofintent--was so deeply rooted at the time of the Fourteenth

Amendment (or perhaps has become so deeply rooted since)as to be a fundamental principle which that Amendment
enshrined.That showing has not been made. Instead of the uniform
and continuing acceptance we would expect for a rule thatenjoys "fundamental principle" status, we find that fully
one-fifth of the States either never adopted the "new
common-law" rule at issue here or have recently abandonedit.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
("We are aware that all but two of the States . . . haveabandoned the common-law rule . . . . But the question

remains whether those [two] States are in violation ofthe Constitution").

It is not surprising that many States have held fast to orresurrected the common-law rule prohibiting consideration
of voluntary intoxication in the determination of mens rea,because that rule has considerable justification

3--which

alone casts doubt upon the proposition that the opposite ruleis a "fundamental principle." A large number of crimes, especially violent crimes, are committed by intoxicated offend-ers; modern studies put the numbers as high as half of all
homicides, for example. See, e. g., Third Special Report tothe U. S. Congress on Alcohol and Health from the Secretary
of Health, Education, and Welfare 64 (1978); Note, AlcoholAbuse and the Law, 94 Harv. L. Rev. 1660, 1681-1682 (1981).
Disallowing consideration of voluntary intoxication has the

3 In his dissent, Justice Souter acknowledges that there may be valid
policy reasons supporting the Montana law, some of which were brought
forward by States that appeared as amici, see post, at 77-78 (citing Brief
for State of Hawaii et al. as Amici Curiae 16). He refuses to consider
the adequacy of those reasons, however, because they were not brought
forward by Montana's lawyers. We do not know why the constitutionality of Montana's enactment should be subject to the condition subsequent
that its lawyers be able to guess a policy justification that satisfies this
Court. Whatever they guess will of course not necessarily be the real
reason the Montana Legislature adopted the provision; Montana's lawyers
must speculate about that, just as we must. Our standard formulation
has been: "Where . . . there are plausible reasons for [the legislature's]
action, our inquiry is at an end." Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449
U. S. 166, 179 (1980). Justice Souter would change that to: "Where
there are plausible reasons that counsel for the party supporting the legislation have mentioned." Or perhaps it is: "Where there are plausible reasons that counsel for the Government (or State) have mentioned"--so that
in this case Hawaii's amicus brief would count if a Hawaiian statute were
at issue. Either way, it is strange for the constitutionality of a state law
to depend upon whether the lawyers hired by the State (or elected by its
people) to defend the law happen to hit the right boxes on our bingo card
of acceptable policy justifications.

effect of increasing the punishment for all unlawful acts committed in that state, and thereby deters drunkenness or irresponsible behavior while drunk. The rule also serves as a
specific deterrent, ensuring that those who prove incapable
of controlling violent impulses while voluntarily intoxicated
go to prison. And finally, the rule comports with and implements society's moral perception that one who has voluntarily impaired his own faculties should be responsible for the
consequences. See, e. g., McDaniel v. State, 356 So. 2d 1151,
1160-1161 (Miss. 1978).4

There is, in modern times, even more justification for laws
such as $ 45-2-203 than there used to be. Some recent studies suggest that the connection between drunkenness and
crime is as much cultural as pharmacological--that is, that
drunks are violent not simply because alcohol makes them
that way, but because they are behaving in accord with their
learned belief that drunks are violent. See, e. g., Collins,
Suggested Explanatory Frameworks to Clarify the Alcohol
Use/Violence Relationship, 15 Contemp. Drug Prob. 107, 115
(1988); Critchlow, The Powers of John Barleycorn, 41 Am.
Psychologist 751, 754-755 (July 1986). This not only adds
additional support to the traditional view that an intoxicated
criminal is not deserving of exoneration, but it suggests that
juries--who possess the same learned belief as the intoxicated offender--will be too quick to accept the claim that the
defendant was biologically incapable of forming the requisite

4 As appears from this analysis, we are in complete agreement with the
concurrence that $ 45-2-203 "embodies a legislative judgment regarding
the circumstances under which individuals may be held criminally responsible for their actions," post, at 57. We also agree that the statute " `extract[s] the entire subject of voluntary intoxication from the mens rea inquiry,' " post, at 58. We believe that this judgment may be implemented,
and this effect achieved, with equal legitimacy by amending the substantive requirements for each crime, or by simply excluding intoxication evidence from the trial. We address this as an evidentiary statute simply
because that is how the Supreme Court of Montana chose to analyze it.

mens rea. Treating the matter as one of excluding mislead-ing evidence therefore makes some sense.

5

In sum, not every widespread experiment with a proce-dural rule favorable to criminal defendants establishes a fundamental principle of justice. Although the rule allowing ajury to consider evidence of a defendant's voluntary intoxication where relevant to mens rea has gained considerable
acceptance, it is of too recent vintage, and has not receivedsufficiently uniform and permanent allegiance, to qualify as

fundamental, especially since it displaces a lengthy common-law tradition which remains supported by valid justifications today.6

III

The Supreme Court of Montana's conclusion that Mont.
Code Ann. $ 45-2-203 (1995) violates the Due Process Clause
purported to rest on two lines of our jurisprudence. First,

5 These many valid policy reasons for excluding evidence of voluntary
intoxication refute Justice O'Connor's claim that $ 45-2-203 has no purpose other than to improve the State's likelihood of winning a conviction,
see post, at 66-67, 72-73. Such a claim is no more accurate as applied to
this provision than it would have been as applied to the New York law in
Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197 (1977), which placed upon the defendant the burden of proving the affirmative defense of extreme emotional
disturbance. We upheld that New York law, even though we found it
"very likely true that fewer convictions of murder would occur if New
York were required to negative the affirmative defense at issue here."
Id., at 209. Here, as in Patterson, any increase in the chance of obtaining
a conviction is merely a consequence of pursuing legitimate penological
goals.

6 Justice O'Connor maintains that "to determine whether a fundamental principle of justice has been violated here, we cannot consider only the
historical disallowance of intoxication evidence, but must also consider the
`fundamental principle' that a defendant has a right to a fair opportunity
to put forward his defense." Post, at 71. What Justice O'Connor
overlooks, however, is that the historical disallowance of intoxication evidence sheds light upon what our society has understood by a "fair opportunity to put forward [a] defense." That "fundamental principle" has
demonstrably not included the right to introduce intoxication evidence.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
it derived its view that the Due Process Clause requires theadmission of all relevant evidence from the statement in

Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U. S. 284, 294 (1973), that "[t]heright of an accused in a criminal trial to due process is, in
essence, the right to a fair opportunity to defend against the
State's accusations." Respondent relies heavily on thisstatement, which he terms "the

Chambers principle," Brief
for Respondent 30.We held in

Chambers that "the exclusion of [certain]
critical evidence, coupled with the State's refusal to permit[petitioner] to cross-examine McDonald, denied him a trial

in accord with traditional and fundamental standards ofdue process." 410 U. S., at 302. We continued, however:

"In reaching this judgment, we establish no new princi-ples of constitutional law. Nor does our holding signal
any diminution in the respect traditionally accorded tothe States in the establishment and implementation of
their own criminal trial rules and procedures. Rather,
we hold quite simply that under the facts and circumstances of this case the rulings of the trial court
deprived Chambers of a fair trial." Id., at 302-303(emphasis added).

In other words, Chambers was an exercise in highly casespecific error correction. At issue were two rulings by the
state trial court at Chambers' murder trial: denial of Cham-bers' motion to treat as an adverse witness one McDonald,

who had confessed to the murder for which Chambers wason trial, but later retracted the confession; and exclusion, on
hearsay grounds, of testimony of three witnesses who would
testify that McDonald had confessed to them. We held that
both of these rulings were erroneous, the former because
McDonald's testimony simply was adverse, id., at 297-298,
and the second because the statements "were originally
made and subsequently offered at trial under circumstances
that provided considerable assurance of their reliability," id.,

Opinion of Scalia, J.
at 300, and were "well within the basic rationale of the ex-ception for declarations against interest,"

id., at 302. Thus,
the holding of Chambers--if one can be discerned from sucha fact-intensive case--is certainly not that a defendant is

denied "a fair opportunity to defend against the State's accusations" whenever "critical evidence" favorable to him isexcluded, but rather that erroneous evidentiary rulings can,

in combination, rise to the level of a due process violation.Respondent cites our decision in

Crane v. Kentucky, 476
U. S. 683 (1986), as evidence that his version of the "Chambers principle" governs our jurisprudence. He highlights
statements in Crane to the effect that "an essential component of procedural fairness is an opportunity to be heard,"
which would effectively be denied "if the State were permitted to exclude competent, reliable evidence . . . when such
evidence is central to the defendant's claim of innocence."
Id., at 690; Brief for Respondent 31. But the very next
sentence of that opinion (which respondent omits) makes
perfectly clear that we were not setting forth an absolute
entitlement to introduce crucial, relevant evidence: "In the
absence of any valid state justification, exclusion of this
kind of exculpatory evidence deprives a defendant of the
basic right to have the prosecutor's case encounter and survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing." 476
U. S., at 690-691 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks
omitted). Our holding that the exclusion of certain evidence
in that case violated the defendant's constitutional rights
rested not on a theory that all "competent, reliable evidence"
must be admitted, but rather on the ground that the Supreme Court of Kentucky's sole rationale for the exclusion (that the evidence "did not relate to the credibility of
the confession," Crane v. Commonwealth, 690 S. W. 2d 753,
755 (1985)) was wrong. See 476 U. S., at 687. Crane does
nothing to undermine the principle that the introduction of
relevant evidence can be limited by the State for a "valid"
reason, as it has been by Montana.

54 MONTANA v. EGELHOFF

Opinion of Scalia, J.
The second line of our cases invoked by the Montana Su-preme Court's opinion requires even less discussion.

In re
Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970), announced the propositionthat the Due Process Clause requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the charged
crime, and Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510, 524 (1979),established a corollary, that a jury instruction which shifts

to the defendant the burden of proof on a requisite elementof mental state violates due process. These decisions simply are not implicated here because, as the Montana courtitself recognized, "[t]he burden is not shifted" under $ 45-2-
203. 272 Mont., at 124, 900 P. 2d, at 266. The trial judge
instructed the jury that "[t]he State of Montana has the burden of proving the guilt of the Defendant beyond a reasonable doubt," App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a, and that "[a] person
commits the offense of deliberate homicide if he purposely or
knowingly causes the death of another human being," id.,
at 28a. Thus, failure by the State to produce evidence of
respondent's mental state would have resulted in an acquittal. That acquittal did not occur was presumably attributable to the fact, noted by the Supreme Court of Montana,
that the State introduced considerable evidence from which
the jury might have concluded that respondent acted "purposely" or "knowingly." See 272 Mont., at 122, 900 P. 2d,
at 265. For example, respondent himself testified that, several hours before the murders, he had given his handgun to
Pavola and asked her to put it in the glove compartment of
Christenson's car. Ibid.; 5 Tr. 1123. That he had to retrieve the gun from the glove compartment before he used
it was strong evidence that it was his "conscious object" to
commit the charged crimes; as was the execution-style manner in which a single shot was fired into the head of each
victim.

Recognizing that Sandstrom is not directly on point,
the Supreme Court of Montana described $ 45-2-203 as a
burden-reducing, rather than burden-shifting, statute. 272

55Cite as: 518 U. S. 37 (1996)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
Mont., at 122-123, 124, 900 P. 2d, at 265, 266. This obviouslywas not meant to suggest that the statute formally reduced

the burden of proof to clear and convincing, or to a merepreponderance; there is utterly no basis for that, neither in
the text of the law nor in the jury instruction that was given.What the court evidently meant is that, by excluding a significant line of evidence that might refute mens rea, the stat-ute made it easier for the State to meet the requirement of
proving mens rea beyond a reasonable doubt--reduced theburden in the sense of making the burden easier to bear.
But any evidentiary rule can have that effect. "Reducing"the State's burden in this manner is not unconstitutional, unless the rule of evidence itself violates a fundamental princi-ple of fairness (which, as discussed, this one does not). We
have "reject[ed] the view that anything in the Due ProcessClause bars States from making changes in their criminal
law that have the effect of making it easier for the prosecu-tion to obtain convictions." McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477
U. S. 79, 89, n. 5 (1986).Finally, we may comment upon the Montana Supreme
Court's citation of the following passage in Martin v. Ohio,480 U. S. 228 (1987), a case upholding a state law that placed
on the defendant the burden of proving self-defense by a pre-ponderance of the evidence:

"It would be quite different if the jury had been in-structed that self-defense evidence could not be considered in determining whether there was a reasonabledoubt about the State's case,

i. e., that self-defense evi-dence must be put aside for all purposes unless it satisfied the preponderance standard. Such an instructionwould relieve the State of its burden and plainly run
afoul of [In re] Winship's mandate. The instructions inthis case . . . are adequate to convey to the jury that all
of the evidence, including the evidence going to self-defense, must be considered in deciding whether there
was a reasonable doubt about the sufficiency of the

State's proof of the elements of the crime." Id., at 233-234 (citation omitted).

See also 272 Mont., at 122-123, 900 P. 2d, at 265. This pas-sage can be explained in various ways--e. g., as an assertion
that the right to have a jury consider self-defense evidence(unlike the right to have a jury consider evidence of voluntary intoxication) is fundamental, a proposition that thehistorical record may support. But the only explanation
needed for present purposes is the one given in Kokkonen v.
Guardian Life Ins. Co., 511 U. S. 375, 379 (1994): "It is to theholdings of our cases, rather than their dicta, that we must

attend." If the Martin dictum means that the Due ProcessClause requires all relevant evidence bearing on the elements of a crime to be admissible, the decisions we havediscussed show it to be incorrect.

* * *
"The doctrines of actus reus, mens rea, insanity, mistake,justification, and duress have historically provided the tools

for a constantly shifting adjustment of the tension betweenthe evolving aims of the criminal law and changing religious,
moral, philosophical, and medical views of the nature of man.This process of adjustment has always been thought to be
the province of the States." Powell v. Texas, 392 U. S. 514,535-536 (1968) (plurality opinion). The people of Montana
have decided to resurrect the rule of an earlier era, disallow-ing consideration of voluntary intoxication when a defendant's state of mind is at issue. Nothing in the Due ProcessClause prevents them from doing so, and the judgment of
the Supreme Court of Montana to the contrary must bereversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Ginsburg, concurring in the judgment.
The Court divides in this case on a question of character-ization. The State's law, Mont. Code Ann. $ 45-2-203 (1995),

prescribes that voluntary intoxication "may not be taken into
consideration in determining the existence of a mental state
which is an element of [a criminal] offense." For measurement against federal restraints on state action, how should
we type that prescription? If $ 45-2-203 is simply a rule
designed to keep out "relevant, exculpatory evidence," Justice O'Connor maintains, post, at 67, Montana's law offends
due process. If it is, instead, a redefinition of the mentalstate element of the offense, on the other hand, Justice
O'Connor's due process concern "would not be at issue,"
post, at 71, for "[a] state legislature certainly has the authority to identify the elements of the offenses it wishes to punish," post, at 64, and to exclude evidence irrelevant to the
crime it has defined.

Beneath the labels (rule excluding evidence or redefinition
of the offense) lies the essential question: Can a State, without offense to the Federal Constitution, make the judgment
that two people are equally culpable where one commits an
act stone sober, and the other engages in the same conduct
after his voluntary intoxication has reduced his capacity for
self-control? For the reasons that follow, I resist categorizing $ 45-2-203 as merely an evidentiary prescription, but

join the Court's judgment refusing to condemn the Montana
statute as an unconstitutional enactment.

Section 45-2-203 does not appear in the portion of Montana's Code containing evidentiary rules (Title 26), the expected placement of a provision regulating solely the admissibility of evidence at trial. Instead, Montana's intoxication
statute appears in Title 45 ("Crimes"), as part of a chapter
entitled "General Principles of Liability." Mont. Code Ann.,
Tit. 45, ch. 2 (1995). No less than adjacent provisions
governing duress and entrapment, $ 45-2-203 embodies a
legislative judgment regarding the circumstances under
which individuals may be held criminally responsible for
their actions.

58 MONTANA v. EGELHOFF

Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment
As urged by Montana and its amici, $ 45-2-203 "extract[s]the entire subject of voluntary intoxication from the mens

rea inquiry," Reply Brief for Petitioner 2, thereby renderingevidence of voluntary intoxication logically irrelevant to
proof of the requisite mental state. Thus, in a prosecution
for deliberate homicide, the State need not prove that thedefendant "purposely or knowingly cause[d] the death of

another," Mont. Code Ann. $ 45-5-102(a) (1995), in a purelysubjective sense. To obtain a conviction, the prosecution
must prove only that (1) the defendant caused the death ofanother with actual knowledge or purpose,

or (2) that the
defendant killed "under circumstances that would otherwise
establish knowledge or purpose `but for' [the defendant's]
voluntary intoxication." Brief for American Alliance for
Rights and Responsibilities et al. as Amici Curiae 6. See
also Brief for Petitioner 35-36; Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 10-12. Accordingly, $ 45-2-203 does not
"lighte[n] the prosecution's burden to prove [the] mentalstate element beyond a reasonable doubt," as Justice
O'Connor suggests, post, at 64, for "[t]he applicability of the
reasonable-doubt standard . . . has always been dependent on
how a State defines the offense that is charged," Patterson v.
New York, 432 U. S. 197, 211, n. 12 (1977).

Comprehended as a measure redefining mens rea, $ 45-2-
203 encounters no constitutional shoal. States enjoy wide
latitude in defining the elements of criminal offenses, see,
e. g., Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S. 228, 232 (1987); Patterson, 432
U. S., at 201-202, particularly when determining "the extent
to which moral culpability should be a prerequisite to conviction of a crime," Powell v. Texas, 392 U. S. 514, 545 (1968)
(Black, J., concurring). When a State's power to define
criminal conduct is challenged under the Due Process Clause,
we inquire only whether the law "offends some principle of
justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental." Patterson, 432 U. S.,
at 202 (internal quotation marks omitted). Defining mens

rea to eliminate the exculpatory value of voluntary intoxica-tion does not offend a "fundamental principle of justice,"

given the lengthy common-law tradition, and the adherenceof a significant minority of the States to that position today.
See ante, at 43-49; see also post, at 73 (Souter, J., dissenting) ("[A] State may so define the mental element of an of-fense that evidence of a defendant's voluntary intoxication at

the time of commission does not have exculpatory relevanceand, to that extent, may be excluded without raising any
issue of due process.").Other state courts have upheld statutes similar to $ 45-2-
203, not simply as evidentiary rules, but as legislative redefinitions of the mental-state element. See State v. Souza,
72 Haw. 246, 249, 813 P. 2d 1384, 1386 (1991) ("legislature
was entitled to redefine the mens rea element of crimes and
to exclude evidence of voluntary intoxication to negate state
of mind"); State v. Ramos, 133 Ariz. 4, 6, 648 P. 2d 119, 121
(1982) ("Perhaps the state of mind which needs to be proven
here is a watered down mens rea; however, this is the prerogative of the legislature."); Commonwealth v. Rumsey, 309
Pa. Super. 137, 139, 454 A. 2d 1121, 1122 (1983) (quoting Powell, 392 U. S., at 536 (plurality opinion)) ("Redefinition of the
kind and quality of mental activity that constitutes the mens
rea element of crimes is a permissible part of the legislature's role in the `constantly shifting adjustment between the
evolving aims of the criminal law and changing religious,
moral, philosophical, and medical views of the nature of
man.' "). Legislation of this order, if constitutional in Arizona, Hawaii, and Pennsylvania, ought not be declared unconstitutional by this Court when enacted in Montana.

If, as the plurality, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Souter agree, it is within the legislature's province to instruct
courts to treat a sober person and a voluntarily intoxicated
person as equally responsible for conduct--to place a voluntarily intoxicated person on a level with a sober person--
then the Montana law is no less tenable under the Federal

Constitution than are the laws, with no significant difference
in wording, upheld in sister States.1 The Montana Supreme
Court did not disagree with the courts of other States; it
simply did not undertake an analysis in line with the principle that legislative enactments plainly capable of a constitutional construction ordinarily should be given that construction. See Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast
Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988);
State v. Lilburn, 265 Mont. 258, 266, 875 P. 2d 1036, 1041
(1994).

The Montana Supreme Court's judgment, in sum, strikes
down a statute whose text displays no constitutional infirmity. If the Montana court considered its analysis forced by
this Court's precedent,2 it is proper for this Court to say

1 Justice Breyer questions the States' authority to treat voluntarily
intoxicated and sober defendants as equally culpable for their actions.
See post, at 80. He asks, moreover, post, at 79-80, why a legislature concerned with the high incidence of crime committed by individuals in an
alcohol-impaired condition would choose the course Montana and several
other States have taken. It would be more sensible, he suggests, to
"equate voluntary intoxication [with] knowledge, and purpose," post, at 80,
thus dispensing entirely with the mens rea requirement when individuals
act under the influence of a judgment-impairing substance. It does not
seem to me strange, however, that States have resisted such a catchall
approach and have enacted, instead, a measure less sweeping, one that
retains a mens rea requirement, but "define[s] culpable mental state so as
to give voluntary intoxication no exculpatory relevance." See post, at 75
(Souter, J., dissenting). Nor is it at all clear to me that "a jury unaware
of intoxication would likely infer knowledge or purpose" in the example
Justice Breyer provides, post, at 79. It is not only in fiction, see J.
Thurber, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1983) (originally published in
The New Yorker in 1939), but, sadly, in real life as well, that sober people
drive while daydreaming or otherwise failing to pay attention to the road.

what prescriptions federal law leaves to the States,3 andthereby dispel confusion to which we may have contributed,

and attendant state-court misperception.

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

The Montana Supreme Court unanimously held that Mont.Code Ann. $ 45-2-203 (1995) violates due process. I agree.

Our cases establish that due process sets an outer limit onthe restrictions that may be placed on a defendant's ability
to raise an effective defense to the State's accusations.Here, to impede the defendant's ability to throw doubt on
the State's case, Montana has removed from the jury's con-sideration a category of evidence relevant to determination
of mental state where that mental state is an essential ele-ment of the offense that must be proved beyond a reasonable
doubt. Because this disallowance eliminates evidence withwhich the defense might negate an essential element, the
State's burden to prove its case is made correspondinglyeasier. The justification for this disallowance is the State's
desire to increase the likelihood of conviction of a certainclass of defendants who might otherwise be able to prove
that they did not satisfy a requisite element of the offense.In my view, the statute's effect on the criminal proceeding
violates due process. I

This Court's cases establish that limitations placed on theaccused's ability to present a fair and complete defense can,
in some circumstances, be severe enough to violate due proc-ess. "The right of an accused in a criminal trial to due process is, in essence, the right to a fair opportunity to defendagainst the State's accusations." Chambers v. Mississippi,

62 MONTANA v. EGELHOFF

O'Connor, J., dissenting
tana Supreme Court held that keeping intoxication evidenceaway from the jury, where such evidence was relevant to

establishment of the requisite mental state, violated the dueprocess right to present a defense, 272 Mont. 114, 123, 900
P. 2d 260, 265 (1995), and that the instruction pursuant to

$ 45-2-203 was not harmless error, id., at 124, 900 P. 2d, at266. In rejecting the Montana Supreme Court's conclusion,

the plurality emphasizes that "any number of familiar andunquestionably constitutional evidentiary rules" permit exclusion of relevant evidence. Ante, at 42. It is true that adefendant does not enjoy an absolute right to present evidence relevant to his defense. See Crane v. Kentucky, 476
U. S. 683, 690-691 (1986). But none of the "familiar" evidentiary rules operates as Montana's does. The Montana statute places a blanket exclusion on a category of evidence that
would allow the accused to negate the offense's mental-state
element. In so doing, it frees the prosecution, in the face of
such evidence, from having to prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that the defendant nevertheless possessed the required mental state. In my view, this combination of effects
violates due process.

The proposition that due process requires a fair opportunity to present a defense in a criminal prosecution is not new.
See id., at 690; California v. Trombetta, 467 U. S. 479, 485
(1984). In Chambers, the defendant had been prevented
from cross-examining a witness and from presenting witnesses on his own behalf by operation of Mississippi's
"voucher" and hearsay rules. The Court held that the application of these evidentiary rules deprived the defendant of a
fair trial. "[W]here constitutional rights directly affecting
the ascertainment of guilt are implicated, the hearsay rule
may not be applied mechanistically to defeat the ends of justice." 410 U. S., at 302. The plurality's characterization of
Chambers as "case-specific error correction," ante, at 52, cannot diminish its force as a prohibition on enforcement of state
evidentiary rules that lead, without sufficient justification, to

the establishment of guilt by suppression of evidence sup-porting the defendant's case.

In Crane, a trial court had held that the defendant couldnot introduce testimony bearing on the circumstances of his
confession, on the grounds that this information bore only
on the "voluntariness" of the confession, a matter alreadyresolved. We held that by keeping such critical information

from the jury this exclusion "deprived petitioner of his fun-damental constitutional right to a fair opportunity to present
a defense." 476 U. S., at 687. The Court emphasized that,while States have the power to exclude evidence through
evidentiary rules that serve the interests of fairness and reliability, limitations on evidence may exceed the bounds of
due process where such limitations undermine a defendant's
ability to present exculpatory evidence without serving a
valid state justification.

In Washington v. Texas, 388 U. S. 14 (1967), the trial court
refused to permit a defense witness to testify on the basis of
Texas statutes providing that persons charged or convicted
as coparticipants in the same crime could not testify for one
another, although they could testify for the State. The
Court held that the Constitution prohibited a State from establishing rules to prevent whole categories of defense witnesses from testifying out of a belief that such witnesses
were untrustworthy. Such action by the State detracted
too severely and arbitrarily from the defendant's right to call
witnesses in his favor.

These cases, taken together, illuminate a simple principle:
Due process demands that a criminal defendant be afforded
a fair opportunity to defend against the State's accusations.
Meaningful adversarial testing of the State's case requires
that the defendant not be prevented from raising an effective
defense, which must include the right to present relevant,
probative evidence. To be sure, the right to present evidence is not limitless; for example, it does not permit the
defendant to introduce any and all evidence he believes

might work in his favor, Crane, supra, at 690, nor does itgenerally invalidate the operation of testimonial privileges,

Washington v. Texas, supra, at 23, n. 21. Nevertheless, "anessential component of procedural fairness is an opportunity
to be heard. That opportunity would be an empty one if the
State were permitted to exclude competent, reliable evi-dence" that is essential to the accused's defense.

Crane,
supra, at 690 (citations omitted). Section 45-2-203 fore-stalls the defendant's ability to raise an effective defense by

placing a blanket exclusion on the presentation of a type ofevidence that directly negates an element of the crime, and
by doing so, it lightens the prosecution's burden to prove
that mental-state element beyond a reasonable doubt.

This latter effect is as important to the due process analysis as the former. A state legislature certainly has the authority to identify the elements of the offenses it wishes to
punish, but once its laws are written, a defendant has the
right to insist that the State prove beyond a reasonable
doubt every element of an offense charged. See McMillan
v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 85 (1986); Patterson v. New
York, 432 U. S. 197, 211, n. 12 (1977) ("The applicability of
the reasonable-doubt standard, however, has always been dependent on how a State defines the offense that is charged").
"[T]he Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every
fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is
charged." In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970); Patterson, supra, at 210. Because the Montana Legislature has
specified that a person commits "deliberate homicide" only if
he "purposely or knowingly causes the death of another
human being," Mont. Code Ann. $ 45-5-102(1)(a) (1995), the
prosecution must prove the existence of such mental state in
order to convict. That is, unless the defendant is shown to
have acted purposely or knowingly, he is not guilty of the
offense of deliberate homicide. The Montana Supreme
Court found that it was inconsistent with the legislature's

O'Connor, J., dissenting
requirement of the mental state of "purposely" or "know-ingly" to prevent the jury from considering evidence of voluntary intoxication, where that category of evidence wasrelevant to establishment of that mental-state element. 272
Mont., at 122-123, 900 P. 2d, at 265-266.

Where the defendant may introduce evidence to negate asubjective mental-state element, the prosecution must work

to overcome whatever doubts the defense has raised aboutthe existence of the required mental state. On the other
hand, if the defendant may not introduce evidence that mightcreate doubt in the factfinder's mind as to whether that element was met, the prosecution will find its job so much the
easier. A subjective mental state is generally proved only
circumstantially. If a jury may not consider the defendant's
evidence of his mental state, the jury may impute to the
defendant the culpability of a mental state he did not
possess.

In Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S. 228 (1987), the Court considered an Ohio statute providing that a defendant bore the
burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, an
affirmative defense such as self-defense. We held that placing that burden on the defendant did not violate due process.
The Court noted in explanation that it would nevertheless
have been error to instruct the jury that "self-defense evidence could not be considered in determining whether there
was a reasonable doubt about the State's case" where Ohio's
definition of the intent element made self-defense evidence
relevant to the State's burden. Id., at 233-234. "Such an
instruction would relieve the State of its burden and plainly
run afoul of Winship's mandate." Id., at 234. In other
words, the State's right to shift the burden of proving an
affirmative defense did not include the power to prevent the
defendant from attempting to prove self-defense in an effort
to cast doubt on the State's case. Dictum or not, this observation explained our reasoning and is similarly applicable
here, where the State has benefited from the defendant's in518US1$70j 05-29-99 18:59:23 PAGES OPINPGT

O'Connor, J., dissenting
ability to make an argument which, if accepted, could throwreasonable doubt on the State's proof. The placement of the

burden of proof for affirmative defenses should not be con-fused with the use of evidence to negate elements of the offense charged.

Crane noted: "In the absence of any valid state justifica-tion, exclusion of this kind of exculpatory evidence [circumstances of confession] deprives a defendant of the basic rightto have the prosecutor's case encounter and survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing." 476 U. S., at 690-691 (internal quotation marks omitted). The State here had
substantial proof of the defendant's knowledge or purpose in
committing these homicides, and might well have prevailed
even had the jury been permitted to consider the defendant's
intoxication. But as in Crane, the prosecution's case has
been insulated from meaningful adversarial testing by the
scale-tipping removal of the necessity to face a critical category of defense evidence.

The plurality ignores Crane's caution that the prosecution
must be put to a full test. Rather, it invokes Crane to emphasize that "introduction of relevant evidence can be limited
by the State for a `valid' reason, as it has been by Montana."
Ante, at 53. The State's brief to this Court enunciates a
single reason: Due to the well-known risks related to voluntary intoxication, it seeks to prevent a defendant's use of his
own voluntary intoxication as basis for exculpation. Brief
for Petitioner 12, 17-19. That is, its interest is to ensure
that even a defendant who lacked the required mental-state
element--and is therefore not guilty--is nevertheless convicted of the offense. The plurality elaborates, ante, at 49-
50, on reasons why Montana might wish to preclude exculpation on the basis of voluntary intoxication, but these
reasons--increased punishment and concomitant deterrence
for those who commit unlawful acts while drunk, and implementation of society's moral perception that those who become drunk should bear the consequences--merely explain

O'Connor, J., dissenting
the State's purpose in trying to improve its likelihood of win-ning convictions. The final justification proffered by the

plurality on Montana's behalf is that Montana's rule perhapsprevents juries, who might otherwise be misled, from being
"too quick to accept the claim that the [drunk] defendant was
biologically incapable of forming the requisite mens rea,"
ante, at 50-51. But this proffered justification is inconsistent with $ 45-2-203's exception for persons who are involun-tarily intoxicated. That exception makes plain that Montana does not consider intoxication evidence misleading--butrather considers it relevant--for the determination of a person's capacity to form the requisite mental state.

A State's placement of a significant limitation on the right
to defend against the State's accusations "requires that the
competing interest be closely examined." Chambers, 410
U. S., at 295. Montana has specified that to prove guilt, the
State must establish that the defendant acted purposely or
knowingly, but has prohibited a category of defendants from
effectively disputing guilt through presentation of evidence
relevant to that essential element. And the evidence is indisputably relevant: The Montana Supreme Court held that
evidence of intoxication is relevant to proof of mental state,
272 Mont., at 122-123, 900 P. 2d, at 265, and furthermore,

$ 45-2-203's exception for involuntary intoxication shows
that the legislature does consider intoxication relevant to
mental state. Montana has barred the defendant's use of a
category of relevant, exculpatory evidence for the express
purpose of improving the State's likelihood of winning a conviction against a certain type of defendant. The plurality's
observation that all evidentiary rules that exclude exculpatory evidence reduce the State's burden to prove its case,
ante, at 55, is beside the point. The purpose of the familiar evidentiary rules is not to alleviate the State's burden,
but rather to vindicate some other goal or value--e. g., to ensure the reliability and competency of evidence or to encourage effective communications within certain relationships.

O'Connor, J., dissenting
Such rules may or may not help the prosecution, and whenthey do help, do so only incidentally. While due process

does not "ba[r] States from making changes . . . that havethe effect of making it easier for the prosecution to obtain
convictions," McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S., at 89,n. 5 (emphasis added), an evidentiary rule whose sole

pur-pose is to boost the State's likelihood of conviction distorts

the adversary process. Cf. Washington, 388 U. S., at 25(Harlan, J., concurring in result). Unlike Chambers and
Washington, where the State at least claimed that the evi-dence at issue was unreliable, Montana does not justify its
rule on grounds such as that intoxication evidence is unrelia-ble, cumulative, privileged, or irrelevant. The sole purpose
for this disallowance is to keep from the jury's considerationa category of evidence that helps the defendant's case and
weakens the government's case.The plurality brushes aside this Court's precedents as variously fact bound, irrelevant, and dicta. I would afford moreweight to principles enunciated in our case law than is accorded in the plurality's opinion today. It seems to me thata State may not first determine the elements of the crime it
wishes to punish, and then thwart the accused's defense bycategorically disallowing the very evidence that would prove
him innocent. II

The plurality does, however, raise an important argumentfor the statute's validity: the disallowance, at common law, of
consideration of voluntary intoxication where a defendant'sstate of mind is at issue. Because this disallowance was permitted at common law, the plurality argues, its disallowanceby Montana cannot amount to a violation of a "fundamental
principle of justice." Ante, at 43-51.From 1551 until its shift in the 19th century, the commonlaw rule prevailed that a defendant could not use intoxicationas an excuse or justification for an offense, or, it must be
assumed, to rebut establishment of a requisite mental state.

"Early law was indifferent to the defence of drunkennessbecause the theory of criminal liability was then too crude

and too undeveloped to admit of exceptions. . . . But with therefinement in the theory of criminal liability . . . a modification of the rigid old rule on the defence of drunkenness was
to be expected." Singh, History of the Defense of Drunken-ness in English Criminal Law, 49 L. Q. Rev. 528, 537 (1933)

(footnote omitted). As the plurality concedes, that signifi-cant modification took place in the 19th century. Courts acknowledged the fundamental incompatibility of a particularmental-state requirement on the one hand, and the disallowance of consideration of evidence that might defeat establishment of that mental state on the other. In the slow progress
typical of the common law, courts began to recognize that
evidence of intoxication was properly admissible for the purpose of ascertaining whether a defendant had met the required mental-state element of the offense charged.

This recognition, courts believed, was consistent with the
common-law rule that voluntary intoxication did not excuse
commission of a crime; rather, an element of the crime, the
requisite mental state, was not satisfied and therefore the
crime had not been committed. As one influential mid-19th
century case explained: "Drunkenness is no excuse for crime;
yet, in that class of crimes and offences which depend upon
guilty knowledge, or the coolness and deliberation with
which they shall have been perpetrated, to constitute their
commission . . . [drunkenness] should be submitted to the
consideration of the Jury"; for, where the crime required a
particular mental state, "it is proper to show any state or
condition of the person that is adverse to the proper exercise
of the mind" in order "[t]o rebut" the mental state or "to
enable the Jury to judge rightly of the matter." Pigman v.
State, 14 Ohio 555, 556-557 (1846); accord, Cline v. State, 43
Ohio St. 332, 334, 1 N. E. Rep. 22, 23 (1885) ("The rule is well
settled that intoxication is not a justification or an excuse
for crime. . . . But in many cases evidence of intoxication is

admissible with a view to the question whether a crime hasbeen committed; . . . . As [mental state], in such case, is

of the essence of the offense, it is possible that in provingintoxication you go far to prove that no offense was
committed").

Courts across the country agreed that where a subjectivemental state was an element of the crime to be proved, the

defense must be permitted to show, by reference to intoxica-tion, the absence of that element. One court commented
that it seemed "incontrovertible and to be universally appli-cable" that "where the nature and essence of the crime are
made by law to depend upon the peculiar state and condition
of the criminal's mind at the time with reference to the act
done, drunkenness may be a proper subject for the consideration of the jury, not to excuse or mitigate the offence but
to show that it was not committed." People v. Robinson,
2 Park. Crim. 235, 306 (N. Y. Sup. Ct. 1855). See also Swan
v. State, 23 Tenn. 136, 141-142 (1843); State v. Donovan, 61
Iowa 369, 370-371, 16 N. W. 206, 206-207 (1883); Mooney v.
State, 33 Ala. 419, 420 (1859); Aszman v. State, 123 Ind. 347,
24 N. E. 123 (1890) (citing cases).

With similar reasoning, the Montana Supreme Court recognized the incompatibility of a jury instruction pursuant to

$ 45-2-203 in conjunction with the legislature's decision to
require a mental state of "purposely" or "knowingly" for
deliberate homicide. It held that intoxication is relevant to
formation of the requisite mental state. Unless a defendant
is proved beyond a reasonable doubt to have possessed the
requisite mental state, he did not commit the offense. Elimination of a critical category of defense evidence precludes a
defendant from effectively rebutting the mental-state element, while simultaneously shielding the State from the
effort of proving the requisite mental state in the face of
negating evidence. It was this effect on the adversarial
process that persuaded the Montana Supreme Court that the
disallowance was unconstitutional.

The Due Process Clause protects those " `principle[s] ofjustice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our

people as to be ranked as fundamental.' " Patterson v. NewYork, 432 U. S., at 202 (citations omitted). At the time the
Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, the common-law ruleon consideration of intoxication evidence was in flux. The
plurality argues that rejection of the historical rule in the19th century simply does not establish that the " `new
common-law' " rule is a principle of procedure so "deeplyrooted" as to be ranked "fundamental."

Ante, at 46-48.But to determine whether a fundamental principle of justice

has been violated here, we cannot consider only the historicaldisallowance of intoxication evidence, but must also consider
the "fundamental principle" that a defendant has a right toa fair opportunity to put forward his defense, in adversarial
testing where the State must prove the elements of the of-fense beyond a reasonable doubt. As concepts of

mens reaand burden of proof developed, these principles came into

conflict, as the shift in the common law in the 19th centuryreflects.

III
Justice Ginsburg concurs in the Court's judgment basedon her determination that $ 45-2-203 amounts to a redefinition of the offense that renders evidence of voluntary intoxi-cation irrelevant to proof of the requisite mental state. The
concurrence emphasizes that States enjoy wide latitude indefining the elements of crimes and concludes that, "[c]omprehended as a measure redefining mens rea, $ 45-2-203encounters no constitutional shoal." Ante, at 58.

A state legislature certainly possesses the authority todefine the offenses it wishes to punish. If the Montana
Legislature chose to redefine this offense so as to alter therequisite mental-state element, the due process problem
presented in this case would not be at issue.There is, however, no indication that such a "redefinition"
occurred. Justice Ginsburg's reading of Montana law is

plainly inconsistent with that given by the Montana SupremeCourt, and therefore cannot provide a valid basis to uphold

$ 45-2-203's operation. "We are, of course, bound to acceptthe interpretation of [state] law by the highest court of the
State." Hortonville Joint School Dist. No. 1 v. Hortonville

Corp. v. Regents of Univ. of N. Y., 360 U. S. 684, 688 (1959).The Montana Supreme Court held that evidence of voluntary

intoxication was relevant to the requisite mental state. 272Mont., at 122, 900 P. 2d, at 265. And in summing up the
court's holding, Justice Nelson's concurrence explains that
while the legislature may enact the statutes it chooses, $ 45-
2-203 "effectively and impermissibly . . . lessens the burden
of the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt an essential
element of the offense charged--the mental state element--
by statutorily precluding the jury from considering the very
evidence that might convince them that the State had not
proven that element." Id., at 128, 900 P. 2d, at 268. The
Montana Supreme Court's decision cannot be read consistently with a "redefinition" of the offense.

Because the management of criminal justice is within the
province of the States, Patterson, supra, at 201-202, this
Court is properly reluctant to interfere in the States' authority in these matters. Nevertheless, the Court must invalidate those rules that violate the requirements of due process.
The plurality acknowledges that a reduction of the State's
burden through disallowance of exculpatory evidence is unconstitutional if it violates a principle of fairness. Ante, at
55. I believe that such a violation is present here. Montana's disallowance of consideration of voluntary-intoxication
evidence removes too critical a category of relevant, exculpatory evidence from the adversarial process by prohibiting
the defendant from making an essential argument and permitting the prosecution to benefit from its suppression.
Montana's purpose is to increase the likelihood of conviction

of a certain class of defendants, who might otherwise be ableto prove that they did not satisfy a requisite element of the

offense. The historical fact that this disallowance once ex-isted at common law is not sufficient to save the statute
today. I would affirm the judgment of the Montana Supreme Court.

Justice Souter, dissenting.
I have no doubt that a State may so define the mental
element of an offense that evidence of a defendant's volun-tary intoxication at the time of commission does not have

exculpatory relevance and, to that extent, may be excludedwithout raising any issue of due process. I would have
thought the statute at issue here (Mont. Code Ann. $ 45-2-203 (1995)) had implicitly accomplished such a redefinition,
but I read the opinion of the Supreme Court of Montana as
indicating that it had no such effect, and I am bound by the
state court's statement of its domestic law.

Even on the assumption that Montana's definitions of the
purposeful and knowing culpable mental states were untouched by $ 45-2-203, so that voluntary intoxication remains relevant to each, it is not a foregone conclusion that
our cases preclude the State from declaring such intoxication
evidence inadmissible. A State may typically exclude even
relevant and exculpatory evidence if it presents a valid justification for doing so. There may (or may not) be a valid
justification to support a State's decision to exclude, rather
than render irrelevant, evidence of a defendant's voluntary
intoxication. Montana has not endeavored, however, to advance an argument to that effect. Rather, the State has effectively restricted itself to advancing undoubtedly sound
reasons for defining the mental state element so as to make
voluntary intoxication generally irrelevant (though its own
Supreme Court has apparently said the legislature failed to
do that) and to demonstrating that evidence of voluntary intoxication was irrelevant at common law (a fact that goes

part way, but not all the way, to answering the due processobjection). In short, I read the State Supreme Court opinion as barring one interpretation that would leave the statu-tory scheme constitutional, while the State's failure to offer
a justification for excluding relevant evidence leaves usunable to discern whether there may be a valid reason to
support the statute as the State Supreme Court appears toview it. I therefore respectfully dissent from the Court's
judgment. I

The plurality opinion convincingly demonstrates thatwhen the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause was
added to the Constitution in 1868, the common law as it thenstood either rejected the notion that voluntary intoxication
might be exculpatory, ante, at 43-45, or was at best in a stateof flux on that issue. See also

ante, at 68-71 (O'Connor, J.,dissenting). That is enough to show that Montana's rule

that evidence of voluntary intoxication is inadmissible on theissue of culpable mental state contravenes no principle " `so
rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people,' " asthey stood in 1868, " `as to be ranked as fundamental,' "

ante,at 47 (quoting Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 202

(1977)). But this is not the end of the due process enquiry.Justice Harlan's dissenting opinion in

Poe v. Ullman, 367U. S. 497, 542 (1961), teaches that the "tradition" to which

we are tethered "is a living thing." 1 What the historicalpractice does not rule out as inconsistent with "the concept
of ordered liberty," Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 325

1 "The balance of which I speak is the balance struck by this country,
having regard to what history teaches are the traditions from which it
developed as well as the traditions from which it broke. That tradition is
a living thing. A decision of this Court which radically departs from it
could not long survive, while a decision which builds on what has survived
is likely to be sound. No formula could serve as a substitute, in this area,
for judgment and restraint." Poe v. Ullman, 367 U. S., at 542 (Harlan,
J., dissenting).

(1937), must still pass muster as rational in today's world.Cf. Medina v. California, 505 U. S. 437, 454 (1992) (

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (although "historical pedi-gree can give a procedural practice a presumption of constitutionality . . . , the presumption must surely be rebuttable").In this case, the second step of the due process enquiry
leads to a line of precedent discussed in Justice O'Connor'sdissent,

ante, at 61-68, involving the right to present a de-fense. See, e. g., Washington v. Texas, 388 U. S. 14, 22 (1967)

(a State cannot arbitrarily bar "whole categories of defensewitnesses from testifying"); id., at 25 (Harlan, J., concurring
in result) (State may not "recogniz[e] [testimony as] relevantand competent [but] arbitrarily ba[r] its use by the defendant"); Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U. S. 284, 294 (1973) (de-fendant entitled to a "fair opportunity to defend against the
State's accusations"); Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 683, 690(1986) (States may not exclude "competent, reliable evidence" that is "central to the defendant's claim of innocence"absent an adequate justification). Collectively, these cases
stand for the proposition, as the Court put it in Chambers,supra, at 295, that while the right to present relevant evidence may be limited, the Constitution "requires that thecompeting interest [said to justify the limitation] be closely
examined." II

Given the foregoing line of authority, Montana had at leastone way to give effect to its judgment that defendants should
not be permitted to use evidence of their voluntary intoxica-tion to defeat proof of culpable mental state, and perhaps a
second. First, it could have defined culpable mental stateso as to give voluntary intoxication no exculpatory relevance.
While the Due Process Clause requires the government toprove the existence of every element of the offense beyond
a reasonable doubt, In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970),within fairly broad limits the definition of those elements is
up to the State. We thus noted in Patterson v. New York,

76 MONTANA v. EGELHOFF

Souter, J., dissenting
432 U. S., at 211, n. 12, that the various "due process guarantees are dependent upon the law as defined in the legislative
branches," particularly on the legislature's enumeration of
the elements of an offense, see id., at 210 ("[T]he Due Process
Clause requires the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements included in the definition of
the offense of which the defendant is charged"). See also
McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 85 (1986) ("[I]n determining what facts must be proved beyond a reasonable
doubt the state legislature's definition of the elements of the
offense is usually dispositive"); Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S. 228,
233 (1987) (same).

While I therefore find no apparent constitutional reason
why Montana could not render evidence of voluntary intoxication excludable as irrelevant by redefining "knowledge"
and "purpose," as they apply to the mental state element of
its substantive offenses, or by making some other provision
for mental state,2 I do not believe that I am free to conclude
that Montana has done so here. Our view of state law is

determination of mental state, an essential element of theoffense).

A second possible (although by no means certain) optionmay also be open. Even under a definition of the mental
state element that would treat evidence of voluntary intoxication as relevant and exculpatory, the exclusion of such evi-dence is typically permissible so long as a State presents a

" `valid' reason," ante, at 66 (O'Connor, J., dissenting), tojustify keeping it out.

Chambers and its line of precedent
certainly recognize that such evidence may often properlybe excluded. See

Chambers, supra, at 295. As the plurality notes, ante, at 42, Federal Rules of Evidence 403 (ad-dressing prejudice, confusion, misleading the jury, waste of

time, etc.) and 802 (hearsay) provide two examples of an
adequate reason for excluding relevant evidence.Hence, I do not rule out the possibility of justifying exclusion of relevant intoxication evidence in a case like this. At
the least, there may be reasons beyond those actually advanced by Montana that might have induced a State to reject
its prior law freely admitting intoxication evidence going to
mental state.

A State (though not necessarily Montana) might, for example, argue that admitting intoxication evidence on the issue
of culpable mental state but not on a defense of incapacity (as
to which it is widely assumed to be excludable as generally
irrelevant 3) would be irrational since both capacity to obey
the law and purpose to accomplish a criminal result presuppose volitional ability. See Model Penal Code $ 4.01 ("A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of

3 See American Law Institute, Model Penal Code $ 2.08(4) (1985), which
deems intoxication relevant for this purpose only where by reason of
"pathological intoxication" an "actor at the time of his conduct lacks substantial capacity . . . to conform his conduct to the requirements of law."
The Model Penal Code further defines "pathological intoxication" as "intoxication grossly excessive in degree, given the amount of the intoxicant,
to which the actor does not know he is susceptible." Id., $ 2.08(5)(c).

when . . . it is his conscious object to engage in conduct ofthat nature or to cause such a result"). And quite apart
from any technical irrationality, a State might think thatadmitting the evidence in question on culpable mental state
but not capacity (when each was a jury issue in a given case)would raise too high a risk of juror confusion. See Brief for
State of Hawaii et al. as Amici Curiae 16 ("[U]se of [in-toxication] evidence runs an unacceptable risk of potential
manipulation by defendants and [will lead to] confusion ofjuries, who may not adequately appreciate that intoxication
evidence is to be used for the question of mental state, notfor purposes of showing an excuse"). While Thomas Reed
Powell reportedly suggested that "learning to think like alawyer is when you learn to think about one thing that is
connected to another without thinking about the other thingit is connected to," Teachout, Sentimental Metaphors, 34
UCLA L. Rev. 537, 545 (1986), a State might argue that itslaw should be structured on the assumption that its jurors
typically will not suffer from this facility.4Quite apart from the fact that Montana has made no such
arguments for justification here, however, I am not at allsure why such arguments would go any further than justify4 Teachout notes that Powell acknowledged that this concept was not
explicitly described in his essay entitled A Comment on Professor Sabine's
"Pragmatic Approach to Politics," 81 Pol. Sci. Q. 52, 59 (1966), but in a
letter wrote:

"If you think you can think about a
thing that is hitched to other
things without thinking about the
things that it is hitched to, then
you have a legal mind."

ing redefinition of mental states (the first option above). Ido not understand why they would justify the State in

cutting the conceptual corner 5 by leaving the definitions ofculpable mental states untouched but excluding evidence
relevant to this proof. Absent a convincing argumentfor cutting that corner,

Chambers and the like constrainus to hold the current Montana statute unconstitutional. I

therefore respectfully dissent.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens joins,dissenting.

I join Justice O'Connor's dissent. As the dissent says,and as

Justice Souter agrees, the Montana Supreme Courtdid not understand Montana's statute to have redefined the

mental element of deliberate homicide. In my view, how-ever, this circumstance is not simply happenstance or a technical matter that deprives us of the power to uphold thatstatute. To have read the statute differently--to treat it
as if it had redefined the mental element--would produceanomalous results. A statute that makes voluntary intoxication the legal equivalent of purpose or knowledge but only
where external circumstances would establish purpose orknowledge in the absence of intoxication, see ante, at 58

(Ginsburg, J., concurring), is a statute that turns guilt orinnocence not upon state of mind, but upon irrelevant external circumstances. An intoxicated driver stopped at anintersection who unknowingly accelerated into a pedestrian
would likely be found guilty, for a jury unaware of intoxica-tion would likely infer knowledge or purpose. An identically intoxicated driver racing along a highway who unknow-ingly sideswiped another car would likely be found innocent,
for a jury unaware of intoxication would likely infer negli-gence. Why would a legislature want to write a statute that

draws such a distinction, upon which a sentence of life im-prisonment, or death, may turn? If the legislature wanted

to equate voluntary intoxication, knowledge, and purpose,why would it not write a statute that plainly says so, instead
of doing so in a roundabout manner that would affect, in dra-matically different ways, those whose minds, deeds, and consequences seem identical? I would reserve the question ofwhether or not such a hypothetical statute might exceed constitutional limits. Cf. McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S.79, 85-86 (1986);

KOON v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 94-1664. Argued February 20, 1996--Decided June 13, 1996*
After petitioners, Los Angeles police officers, were acquitted on state

charges of assault and excessive use of force in the beating of a suspect
during an arrest, they were convicted under 18 U. S. C. $ 242 of violating
the victim's constitutional rights under color of law. Although the applicable United States Sentencing Guideline, 1992 USSG $ 2H1.4, indicated that they should be imprisoned for 70 to 87 months, the District
Court granted them two downward departures from that range. The
first was based on the victim's misconduct, which contributed significantly to provoking the offense. The second was based on a combination of four factors: (1) that petitioners were unusually susceptible to
abuse in prison; (2) that petitioners would lose their jobs and be precluded from employment in law enforcement; (3) that petitioners had
been subject to successive state and federal prosecutions; and (4) that
petitioners posed a low risk of recidivism. The sentencing range after
the departures was 30 to 37 months, and the court sentenced each petitioner to 30 months. The Ninth Circuit reviewed the departure decisions de novo and rejected all of them.

Held:

1. An appellate court should not review de novo a decision to depart
from the Guideline sentencing range, but instead should ask whether
the sentencing court abused its discretion. Pp. 92-100.

(a) Although the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 requires that a
district court impose a sentence within the applicable Guideline range
in an ordinary case, 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(a), it does not eliminate all of
the district court's traditional sentencing discretion. Rather, it allows
a departure from the range if the court finds "there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, to a degree, not adequately
taken into consideration" by the Sentencing Commission in formulating
the Guidelines, $ 3553(b). The Commission states that it has formulated
each Guideline to apply to a "heartland" of typical cases and that it did
not "adequately . . . conside[r]" atypical cases, 1995 USSG ch. 1, pt. A,

*Together with No. 94-8842, Powell v. United States, also on certiorari
to the same court.

intro. comment. 4(b). The Commission prohibits consideration of a few
factors, and it provides guidance as to the factors that are likely to make
a case atypical by delineating certain of them as "encouraged" bases for
departure and others as "discouraged" bases for departure. Courts
may depart on the basis of an encouraged factor if the applicable Guideline does not already take the factor into account. A court may depart
on the basis of a discouraged factor, or an encouraged factor already
taken into account, however, only if the factor is present to an exceptional degree or in some other way makes the case different from the
ordinary case. If the Guidelines do not mention a factor, the court
must, after considering the structure and theory of relevant individual
Guidelines and the Guidelines as a whole, decide whether the factor is
sufficiently unusual to take the case out of the Guideline's heartland,
bearing in mind the Commission's expectation that departures based on
factors not mentioned in the Guidelines will be "highly infrequent."
Pp. 92-96.

(b) Although 18 U. S. C. $ 3742 established a limited appellate review of sentencing decisions, $ 3742(e)(4)'s direction to "give due deference to the district court's application of the guidelines to the facts"
demonstrates that the Act was not intended to vest in appellate courts
wide-ranging authority over district court sentencing decisions. See,
e. g., Williams v. United States, 503 U. S. 193, 205. The deference that
is due depends on the nature of the question presented. A departure
decision will in most cases be due substantial deference, for it embodies
the sentencing court's traditional exercise of discretion. See Mistretta
v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 367. To determine if a departure is appropriate, the district court must make a refined assessment of the many
facts that bear on the outcome, informed by its vantage point and dayto-day sentencing experience. Whether a given factor is present to a
degree not adequately considered by the Commission, or whether a discouraged factor nonetheless justifies departure because it is present in
some unusual or exceptional way, are matters determined in large part
by comparison with the facts of other Guidelines cases. District courts
have an institutional advantage over appellate courts in making these
sorts of determinations, especially given that they see so many more
Guidelines cases. Such considerations require adoption of the abuseof-discretion standard of review, not de novo review. See, e. g., Cooter
& Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U. S. 384, 403. Pp. 96-100.

2. Because the Court of Appeals erred in rejecting certain of the
downward departure factors relied upon by the District Judge, the
foregoing principles require reversal of the appellate court's rulings in
significant part. Pp. 100-114.

(a) Victim misconduct is an encouraged basis for departure under
USSG $ 5K2.10, and the District Court did not abuse its discretion in
basing a departure on it. The court's analysis of this departure factor
showed a correct understanding in applying $ 2H1.4, the Guideline applicable to 18 U. S. C. $ 242, both as a mechanical matter and in interpreting its heartland. As the court recognized, $ 2H1.4 incorporates
the Guideline for the offense underlying the $ 242 violation, here $ 2A2.2
for aggravated assault, and thus creates a Guideline range and a heartland for aggravated assault committed under color of law. A downward
departure under $ 5K2.10 was justified because the punishment prescribed by $ 2A2.2 contemplates unprovoked assaults, not cases like this
where what begins as legitimate force in response to provocation becomes excessive. The Court of Appeals misinterpreted the District
Court to have found that the victim had been the but-for cause of the
crime, but not that he had provoked it; it also misinterpreted the heartland of the applicable Guideline range by concentrating on whether
the victim's misconduct made this an unusual case of excessive force.
Pp. 101-105.

(b) This Court rejects the Government's contention that some of
the four considerations underlying the District Court's second downward departure are impermissible departure factors under all circumstances. For a court to conclude that a factor must never be considered
would be to usurp the policymaking authority that Congress vested in
the Commission, and 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(a)(2) does not compel such a
result. A court's examination of whether a factor can ever be an appropriate basis for departure is limited to determining whether the
Commission has proscribed, as a categorical matter, that factor's
consideration. If the answer is no--as it will be most of the time--the
sentencing court must determine whether the factor, as occurring in the
particular circumstances, takes the case outside the applicable Guideline's heartland. Pp. 106-109.

(c) The District Court abused its discretion in relying on petitioners' collateral employment consequences as support for its second departure. Because it is to be expected that a public official convicted of
using his governmental authority to violate a person's rights will lose
his or her job and be barred from similar employment in the future, it
must be concluded that the Commission adequately considered these
consequences in formulating 1992 USSG $ 2H1.4. Thus, the career loss
factor, as it exists in this suit, cannot take the suit out of $ 2H1.4's heartland. Pp. 109-111.

(d) The low likelihood of petitioners' recidivism was also an inappropriate ground for departure, since the Commission specifically ad518us1$71z 05-19-99 16:40:35 PAGES OPINPGT
84 KOON v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
dressed this factor in formulating the sentencing range for petitioners'
criminal history category. See $ 4A1.3. P. 111.

(e) However, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in relying upon susceptibility to abuse in prison and the burdens of successive
prosecutions. The District Court's finding that the case is unusual due
to petitioners' exceptional susceptibility to abuse in prison is just the
sort of determination that must be accorded deference on appeal.
Moreover, although consideration of petitioners' successive prosecutions
could be incongruous with the dual responsibilities of citizenship in our
federal system, this Court cannot conclude the District Court abused its
discretion by considering that factor. Pp. 111-112.

(f) Where a reviewing court concludes that a district court based a
departure on both valid and invalid factors, a remand is required unless
the reviewing court determines that the district court would have imposed the same sentence absent reliance on the invalid factors. Williams, supra, at 203. Because the District Court here stated that none
of four factors standing alone would justify its second departure, it is
not evident that the court would have imposed the same sentence had
it relied only on susceptibility to abuse and the hardship of successive
prosecutions. The Court of Appeals should therefore remand the action to the District Court. Pp. 113-114.

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
The United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines es-tablish ranges of criminal sentences for federal offenses and

offenders. A district court must impose a sentence withinthe applicable Guideline range, if it finds the case to be a
typical one. See 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(a). District courts maydepart from the Guideline range in certain circumstances,
however, see ibid., and here the District Court departeddownward eight levels. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit rejected the District Court's departure rulings, and,over the published objection of nine of its judges, declined
to rehear the case en banc. In this suit we explore the ap-propriate standards of appellate review of a district court's
decision to depart from the Guidelines.

I

The petitioners' guilt has been established, and we are con-cerned here only with the sentencing determinations made

by the District Court and Court of Appeals. A sentencingcourt's departure decisions are based on the facts of the case,
however, so we must set forth the details of the crime atsome length.

ber of hours. Then, with King driving, they left Altadenavia a major freeway. King was intoxicated.

California Highway Patrol officers observed King's cartraveling at a speed they estimated to be in excess of 100
m.p.h. The officers followed King with red lights and sirens
activated and ordered him by loudspeaker to pull over, buthe continued to drive. The Highway Patrol officers called

on the radio for help. Units of the Los Angeles Police De-partment joined in the pursuit, one of them manned by petitioner Laurence Powell and his trainee, Timothy Wind.King left the freeway, and after a chase of about eight
miles, stopped at an entrance to a recreation area. The officers ordered King and his two passengers to exit the car
and to assume a felony prone position--that is, to lie on their
stomachs with legs spread and arms behind their backs.
King's two friends complied. King, too, got out of the car
but did not lie down. Petitioner Stacey Koon arrived, at
once followed by Ted Briseno and Roland Solano. All were
officers of the Los Angeles Police Department, and as sergeant, Koon took charge. The officers again ordered King
to assume the felony prone position. King got on his hands
and knees but did not lie down. Officers Powell, Wind, Briseno and Solano tried to force King down, but King resisted
and became combative, so the officers retreated. Koon then
fired taser darts (designed to stun a combative suspect)
into King.

The events that occurred next were captured on videotape
by a bystander. As the videotape begins, it shows that King
rose from the ground and charged toward Officer Powell.
Powell took a step and used his baton to strike King on the
side of his head. King fell to the ground. From the 18th
to the 30th second on the videotape, King attempted to rise,
but Powell and Wind each struck him with their batons to
prevent him from doing so. From the 35th to the 51st second, Powell administered repeated blows to King's lower extremities; one of the blows fractured King's leg. At the 55th

second, Powell struck King on the chest, and King rolledover and lay prone. At that point, the officers stepped back

and observed King for about 10 seconds. Powell began toreach for his handcuffs. (At the sentencing phase, the District Court found that Powell no longer perceived King to bea threat at this point.)

At one-minute-five-seconds (1:05) on the videotape, Bri-seno, in the District Court's words, "stomped" on King's
upper back or neck. King's body writhed in response. At1:07, Powell and Wind again began to strike King with a
series of baton blows, and Wind kicked him in the upperthoracic or cervical area six times until 1:26. At about 1:29,
King put his hands behind his back and was handcuffed.Where the baton blows fell and the intentions of King and
the officers at various points were contested at trial, but, asnoted, petitioners' guilt has been established.

Powell radioed for an ambulance. He sent two messagesover a communications network to the other officers that said
" `ooops' " and " `I havent [sic] beaten anyone this bad in along time.' " 34 F. 3d 1416, 1425 (CA9 1994). Koon sent a
message to the police station that said: " `U[nit] just had abig time use of force. . . . Tased and beat the suspect of CHP
pursuit big time.' " Ibid.King was taken to a hospital where he was treated for a
fractured leg, multiple facial fractures, and numerous bruisesand contusions. Learning that King worked at Dodger Stadium, Powell said to King: " `We played a little ball tonight,didn't we Rodney? . . . You know, we played a little ball, we
played a little hardball tonight, we hit quite a few homeruns. . . . Yes, we played a little ball and you lost and we
won.' " Ibid. B

Koon, Powell, Briseno, and Wind were tried in state courton charges of assault with a deadly weapon and excessive
use of force by a police officer. The officers were acquittedof all charges, with the exception of one assault charge

against Powell that resulted in a hung jury. The verdictstouched off widespread rioting in Los Angeles. More than

40 people were killed in the riots, more than 2,000 were in-jured, and nearly $1 billion in property was destroyed.
New Initiatives for a New Los Angeles: Final Report and
Recommendations, Senate Special Task Force on a New LosAngeles, Dec. 9, 1992, pp. 10-11.

On August 4, 1992, a federal grand jury indicted the fourofficers under 18 U. S. C. $ 242, charging them with violating
King's constitutional rights under color of law. Powell, Bri-seno, and Wind were charged with willful use of unreasonable force in arresting King. Koon was charged with willfully permitting the other officers to use unreasonable force
during the arrest. After a trial in United States District
Court for the Central District of California, the jury convicted Koon and Powell but acquitted Wind and Briseno.

We now consider the District Court's sentencing determinations. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a district court
identifies the base offense level assigned to the crime
in question, adjusts the level as the Guidelines instruct,
and determines the defendant's criminal history category.
United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual

$ 1B1.1 (Nov. 1992) (1992 USSG). Coordinating the adjusted
offense level and criminal history category yields the appropriate sentencing range. Ibid.

The District Court sentenced petitioners pursuant to 1992
USSG $ 2H1.4, which applies to violations of 18 U. S. C. $ 242.
Section 2H1.4 prescribes a base offense level which is the
greater of the following: 10, or 6 plus the offense level applicable to any underlying offense. The District Court found
the underlying offense was aggravated assault, which carries
a base offense level of 15, 1992 USSG $ 2A2.2(a), to which 6
was added for a total of 21.

The court increased the offense level by four because
petitioners had used dangerous weapons, $ 2A2.2(b)(2)(B).
The Government asked the court also to add four levels for

Opinion of the Court
King's serious bodily injury pursuant to $ 2A2.2(b)(3)(B).The court found, however, that King's serious injuries were

sustained when the officers were using lawful force. (Attrial, the Government contended that all the blows administered after King fell to the ground 30 seconds into the videotape violated $ 242. The District Court found that many ofthose blows "may have been tortious," but that the criminal

violations did not commence until 1:07 on the videotape, afterBriseno stomped King. 833 F. Supp. 769, 778 (CD Cal.
1993).) The court did add two levels for bodily injury pursu-ant to $ 2A2.2(b)(3)(A). The adjusted offense level totaled
27, and because neither petitioner had a criminal record, each
fell within criminal history category I. The sentencing
range for an offense level of 27 and a criminal history category I was, under the 1992 Guidelines, 70-to-87 months' imprisonment. Rather than sentencing petitioners to a term
within the Guideline range, however, the District Court
departed downward eight levels. The departure determinations are the subject of this controversy.

The court granted a five-level departure because "the
victim's wrongful conduct contributed significantly to provoking the offense behavior," $ 5K2.10, p. s. 833 F. Supp.,
at 787. The court also granted a three-level departure,
based on a combination of four factors. First, as a result of
the "widespread publicity and emotional outrage which have
surrounded this case," petitioners were "particularly likely
to be targets of abuse" in prison. Id., at 788. Second, petitioners would face job-termination proceedings, after which
they would lose their positions as police officers, be disqualified from prospective employment in the field of law enforcement, and suffer the "anguish and disgrace these deprivations entail." Id., at 789. Third, petitioners had been
"significantly burden[ed]" by having been subjected to successive state and federal prosecutions. Id., at 790. Fourth,
petitioners were not "violent, dangerous, or likely to engage
in future criminal conduct," so there was "no reason to

Opinion of the Court
impose a sentence that reflects a need to protect the publicfrom [them]."

Ibid. The court concluded these factors justified a departure when taken together, although none wouldhave been sufficient standing alone.

Id., at 786.
The departures yielded an offense level of 19 and a sentencing range of 30-to-37 months' imprisonment. The courtsentenced each petitioner to 30 months' imprisonment. The

petitioners appealed their convictions, and the Governmentappealed the sentences, arguing that the District Court
erred in granting the downward departures and in failing toadjust the offense level upward for serious bodily injury.
The Court of Appeals affirmed petitioners' convictions, and
affirmed the District Court's refusal to adjust the offense
level, but it reversed the District Court's departure determinations. Only the last ruling is before us.

The Court of Appeals reviewed "de novo whether the district court had authority to depart." 34 F. 3d, at 1451. The
court reversed the five-level departure for victim misconduct, reasoning that misbehavior by suspects is typical in
cases involving excessive use of force by police and is thus
comprehended by the applicable Guideline. Id., at 1460.

As for the three-level departure, the court rejected each
factor cited. Acknowledging that a departure for susceptibility to abuse in prison may be appropriate in some instances and that police officers as a group are susceptible to
prison abuse, the court nevertheless said the factor did not
justify departure because "reliance solely on hostility toward
a group of which the defendant is a member provides an
unlimited open-ended rationale for departing." Id., at 1455.
The court further noted that, unlike cases in which a defendant is vulnerable to prison abuse due to physical characteristics over which he has no control, here the petitioners'
vulnerability stemmed from public condemnation of their
crimes. Id., at 1456.

As for petitioners' collateral employment consequences,
the court first held consideration of the factor by the trial

Opinion of the Court
court inconsistent with the sentencing goals of 18 U. S. C.$ 3553(a) because the factor did not "speak to the offender's

character, the nature or seriousness of the offense, or someother legitimate sentencing concern." 34 F. 3d, at 1453.
The court noted further that because the societal consequences of a criminal conviction are almost unlimited, reli-ance on them "would create a system of sentencing that

would be boundless in the moral, social, and psychologicalexaminations it required courts to make."

Id., at 1454.
Third, the court noted the ease of using the factor to justifydepartures based on a defendant's socioeconomic status, a

consideration that, under 1992 USSG $ 5H1.10, is never a
permitted basis for departure. As a final point, the Court
of Appeals said the factor was "troubling" because petitioners, as police officers, held positions of trust they had abused.
Section 3B1.3 of the Guidelines increases, rather than decreases, punishment for those who abuse positions of trust.
34 F. 3d, at 1454.

The Court of Appeals next found the successive state and
federal prosecutions could not be a downward departure factor. It deemed the factor irrelevant to the sentencing goals
of $ 3553(a)(2) and contradictory to the Attorney General's
determination that compelling federal interests warranted a
second prosecution. Id., at 1457. The court rejected the
last departure factor as well, ruling that low risk of recidivism was comprehended in the criminal history category and
so should not be double counted. Id., at 1456-1457.

We granted certiorari to determine the standard of review
governing appeals from a district court's decision to depart
from the sentencing ranges in the Guidelines. 515 U. S. 1190
(1995). The appellate court should not review the departure
decision de novo, but instead should ask whether the sentencing court abused its discretion. Having invoked the
wrong standard, the Court of Appeals erred further in rejecting certain of the downward departure factors relied
upon by the District Judge.

Opinion of the Court

II
The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, as amended, 18
U. S. C. $ 3551 et seq., 28 U. S. C. $$ 991-998, made farreaching changes in federal sentencing. Before the Act,
sentencing judges enjoyed broad discretion in determining
whether and how long an offender should be incarcerated.
Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 363 (1989). The
discretion led to perceptions that "federal judges mete out
an unjustifiably wide range of sentences to offenders with
similar histories, convicted of similar crimes, committed
under similar circumstances." S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 38
(1983). In response, Congress created the United States
Sentencing Commission and charged it with developing a
comprehensive set of sentencing guidelines, 28 U. S. C. $ 994.
The Commission promulgated the United States Sentencing
Guidelines, which "specify an appropriate [sentencing range]
for each class of convicted persons" based on various factors
related to the offense and the offender. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual ch. 1, pt. A, p. 1
(Nov. 1995) (1995 USSG). A district judge now must impose
on a defendant a sentence falling within the range of the
applicable Guideline, if the case is an ordinary one.

The Act did not eliminate all of the district court's discretion, however. Acknowledging the wisdom, even the necessity, of sentencing procedures that take into account individual circumstances, see 28 U. S. C. $ 991(b)(1)(B), Congress
allows district courts to depart from the applicable Guideline
range if "the court finds that there exists an aggravating or
mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described." 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(b).
To determine whether a circumstance was adequately taken
into consideration by the Commission, Congress instructed
courts to "consider only the sentencing guidelines, policy

Opinion of the Court
statements, and official commentary of the Sentencing Com-mission." Ibid.

Turning our attention, as instructed, to the GuidelinesManual, we learn that the Commission did not adequately
take into account cases that are, for one reason or another,"unusual." 1995 USSG ch. 1, pt. A, intro. comment. 4(b).
The Introduction to the Guidelines explains:

"The Commission intends the sentencing courts to treateach guideline as carving out a `heartland,' a set of typical cases embodying the conduct that each guideline de-scribes. When a court finds an atypical case, one to
which a particular guideline linguistically applies butwhere conduct significantly differs from the norm, the
court may consider whether a departure is warranted."
Ibid.

The Commission lists certain factors that never can be basesfor departure (race, sex, national origin, creed, religion, socioeconomic status, 1995 USSG $ 5H1.10; lack of guidance asa youth, $ 5H1.12; drug or alcohol dependence, $ 5H1.4; and
economic hardship, $ 5K2.12), but then states that with theexception of those listed factors, it "does not intend to limit
the kinds of factors, whether or not mentioned anywhere elsein the guidelines, that could constitute grounds for departure
in an unusual case." 1995 USSG ch. 1, pt. A, intro. comment.4(b). The Commission gives two reasons for its approach:

"First, it is difficult to prescribe a single set of guide-lines that encompasses the vast range of human conduct
potentially relevant to a sentencing decision. The Com-mission also recognizes that the initial set of guidelines
need not do so. The Commission is a permanent body,empowered by law to write and rewrite guidelines, with
progressive changes, over many years. By monitoringwhen courts depart from the guidelines and by analyzing their stated reasons for doing so and court decisionswith references thereto, the Commission, over time, will

518us1$71l 05-19-99 16:40:35 PAGES OPINPGT
94 KOON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
be able to refine the guidelines to specify more preciselywhen departures should and should not be permitted.

"Second, the Commission believes that despite thecourts' legal freedom to depart from the guidelines, they
will not do so very often. This is because the guide-lines, offense by offense, seek to take account of those
factors that the Commission's data indicate made a sig-nificant difference in pre-guidelines sentencing practice." Ibid.
So the Act authorizes district courts to depart in casesthat feature aggravating or mitigating circumstances of a

kind or degree not adequately taken into consideration bythe Commission. The Commission, in turn, says it has formulated each Guideline to apply to a heartland of typicalcases. Atypical cases were not "adequately taken into consideration," and factors that may make a case atypical pro-vide potential bases for departure. Potential departure factors "cannot, by their very nature, be comprehensively listedand analyzed in advance," 1995 USSG $ 5K2.0, of course.
Faced with this reality, the Commission chose to prohibitconsideration of only a few factors, and not otherwise to
limit, as a categorical matter, the considerations that mightbear upon the decision to depart.

Sentencing courts are not left adrift, however. The Com-mission provides considerable guidance as to the factors that
are apt or not apt to make a case atypical, by listing certainfactors as either encouraged or discouraged bases for departure. Encouraged factors are those "the Commission hasnot been able to take into account fully in formulating the
guidelines." $ 5K2.0. Victim provocation, a factor reliedupon by the District Court in this suit, is an example of an
encouraged downward departure factor, $ 5K2.10, whereasdisruption of a governmental function is an example of an
encouraged upward departure factor, $ 5K2.7. Even an en-couraged factor is not always an appropriate basis for departure, for on some occasions the applicable Guideline will have

95Cite as: 518 U. S. 81 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
taken the encouraged factor into account. For instance, adeparture for disruption of a governmental function "ordinarily would not be justified when the offense of convictionis an offense such as bribery or obstruction of justice; in such
cases interference with a governmental function is inherentin the offense."

Ibid. A court still may depart on the basisof such a factor but only if it "is present to a degree substantially in excess of that which ordinarily is involved in theoffense." $ 5K2.0.

Discouraged factors, by contrast, are those "not ordinarilyrelevant to the determination of whether a sentence should
be outside the applicable guideline range." 1995 USSG ch.5, pt. H, intro. comment. Examples include the defendant's
family ties and responsibilities, 1995 USSG $ 5H1.6, his orher education and vocational skills, $ 5H1.2, and his or her
military, civic, charitable, or public service record, $ 5H1.11.The Commission does not view discouraged factors "as necessarily inappropriate" bases for departure but says theyshould be relied upon only "in exceptional cases." 1995
USSG ch. 5, pt. H, intro. comment.The Commission's treatment of departure factors led
then-Chief Judge Breyer to explain that a sentencing courtconsidering a departure should ask the following questions:

"1) What features of this case, potentially, take it outsidethe Guidelines' `heartland' and make of it a special, or
unusual, case?
"2) Has the Commission forbidden departures based onthose features?

"3) If not, has the Commission encouraged departuresbased on those features?
"4) If not, has the Commission discouraged departuresbased on those features?" United States v. Rivera, 994
F. 2d 942, 949 (CA1 1993).
We agree with this summary. If the special factor is a for-bidden factor, the sentencing court cannot use it as a basis

518us1$71l 05-19-99 16:40:35 PAGES OPINPGT
96 KOON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
for departure. If the special factor is an encouraged factor,the court is authorized to depart if the applicable Guideline

does not already take it into account. If the special factoris a discouraged factor, or an encouraged factor already
taken into account by the applicable Guideline, the courtshould depart only if the factor is present to an exceptional
degree or in some other way makes the case different fromthe ordinary case where the factor is present. Cf.

ibid. Ifa factor is unmentioned in the Guidelines, the court must,

after considering the "structure and theory of both relevantindividual guidelines and the Guidelines taken as a whole,"
ibid., decide whether it is sufficient to take the case out ofthe Guideline's heartland. The court must bear in mind the
Commission's expectation that departures based on groundsnot mentioned in the Guidelines will be "highly infrequent."
1995 USSG ch. 1, pt. A, p. 6.Against this background, we consider the standard of
review. III

Before the Guidelines system, a federal criminal sentencewithin statutory limits was, for all practical purposes, not
reviewable on appeal. Dorszynski v. United States, 418U. S. 424, 431 (1974) (reiterating "the general proposition
that once it is determined that a sentence is within the limi-tations set forth in the statute under which it is imposed,
appellate review is at an end"); United States v. Tucker, 404U. S. 443, 447 (1972) (same). The Act altered this scheme
in favor of a limited appellate jurisdiction to review fed-eral sentences. 18 U. S. C. $ 3742. Among other things, it
allows a defendant to appeal an upward departure and theGovernment to appeal a downward one. $$ 3742(a), (b).

That much is clear. Less clear is the standard of reviewon appeal. The Government advocates

de novo review, say-ing that, like the Guidelines themselves, appellate review of

sentencing, and in particular of departure decisions, was in-tended to reduce unjustified disparities in sentencing. In its

518us1$71l 05-19-99 16:40:35 PAGES OPINPGT

97Cite as: 518 U. S. 81 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
view, de novo review of departure decisions is necessary "toprotect against unwarranted disparities arising from the differing sentencing approaches of individual district judges."Brief for United States 12.

We agree that Congress was concerned about sentencing
disparities, but we are just as convinced that Congress didnot intend, by establishing limited appellate review, to vest

in appellate courts wide-ranging authority over districtcourt sentencing decisions. Indeed, the text of $ 3742 manifests an intent that district courts retain much of their tradi-tional sentencing discretion. Section 3742(e)(4), as enacted
in 1984, provided "[t]he court of appeals shall give due regardto the opportunity of the district court to judge the credibility of the witnesses, and shall accept the findings of fact
of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous." In1988, Congress amended the statute to impose the additional

requirement that courts of appeals "give due deference tothe district court's application of the guidelines to the facts."
Examining $ 3742 in Williams v. United States, 503 U. S. 193(1992), we stated as follows:

"Although the Act established a limited appellate reviewof sentencing decisions, it did not alter a court of appeals' traditional deference to a district court's exerciseof its sentencing discretion. . . . The development of the
guideline sentencing regime has not changed our viewthat, except to the extent specifically directed by statute, `it is not the role of an appellate court to substitute
its judgment for that of the sentencing court as to theappropriateness of a particular sentence.' "

Id., at 205
(quoting Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, 290, n. 16 (1983)).

See also S. Rep. No. 225, at 150 ("The sentencing provisions
of the reported bill are designed to preserve the concept that
the discretion of a sentencing judge has a proper place in
sentencing and should not be displaced by the discretion of
an appellate court").

518us1$71l 05-19-99 16:40:35 PAGES OPINPGT
98 KOON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
That the district court retains much of its traditional dis-cretion does not mean appellate review is an empty exercise.

Congress directed courts of appeals to "give due deferenceto the district court's application of the guidelines to the
facts." 18 U. S. C. $ 3742(e)(4). The deference that is due
depends on the nature of the question presented. Thedistrict court may be owed no deference, for instance, when

the claim on appeal is that it made some sort of mathemati-cal error in applying the Guidelines; under these circumstances, the appellate court will be in as good a position toconsider the question as the district court was in the first
instance.

A district court's decision to depart from the Guidelines,
by contrast, will in most cases be due substantial deference,
for it embodies the traditional exercise of discretion by a
sentencing court. See Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 367 (noting
that although the Act makes the Guidelines binding on sentencing courts, "it preserves for the judge the discretion to
depart from the guideline applicable to a particular case").
Before a departure is permitted, certain aspects of the case
must be found unusual enough for it to fall outside the heartland of cases in the Guideline. To resolve this question, the
district court must make a refined assessment of the many
facts bearing on the outcome, informed by its vantage point
and day-to-day experience in criminal sentencing. Whether
a given factor is present to a degree not adequately considered by the Commission, or whether a discouraged factor
nonetheless justifies departure because it is present in some
unusual or exceptional way, are matters determined in large
part by comparison with the facts of other Guidelines cases.
District courts have an institutional advantage over appellate courts in making these sorts of determinations,
especially as they see so many more Guidelines cases than
appellate courts do. In 1994, for example, 93.9% of Guidelines cases were not appealed. Letter from Pamela G.
Montgomery, Deputy General Counsel, United States Sen518us1$71l 05-19-99 16:40:35 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tencing Commission (Mar. 29, 1996). "To ignore the districtcourt's special competence--about the `ordinariness' or

`unusualness' of a particular case--would risk depriving theSentencing Commission of an important source of information, namely, the reactions of the trial judge to the factspecific circumstances of the case. . . ." Rivera, 994 F. 2d,at 951.

Considerations like these persuaded us to adopt theabuse-of-discretion standard in

Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx
Corp., 496 U. S. 384 (1990), which involved review of a Dis-trict Court's imposition of Rule 11 sanctions, and in

Pierce
v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552 (1988), which involved review of
a District Court's determination under the Equal Access to
Justice Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2412(d), that the position of the
United States was "substantially justified," thereby precluding an award of attorney's fees against the Government.
There, as here, we noted that deference was owed to the
" `judicial actor . . . better positioned than another to decide
the issue in question.' " Pierce, supra, at 559-560 (quoting
Miller v. Fenton, 474 U. S. 104, 114 (1985)); Cooter & Gell,
supra, at 403. Furthermore, we adopted deferential review
to afford "the district court the necessary flexibility to resolve questions involving `multifarious, fleeting, special, narrow facts that utterly resist generalization.' " 496 U. S., at
404 (quoting Pierce, supra, at 561-562). Like the questions

involved in those cases, a district court's departure decision
involves "the consideration of unique factors that are `little
susceptible . . . of useful generalization,' " 496 U. S., at 404,
and as a consequence, de novo review is "unlikely to establish
clear guidelines for lower courts," id., at 405.

The Government seeks to avoid the factual nature of the
departure inquiry by describing it at a higher level of generality linked closely to questions of law. The relevant question, however, is not, as the Government says, "whether a
particular factor is within the `heartland' " as a general proposition, Brief for United States 28, but whether the particu518us1$71l 05-19-99 16:40:35 PAGES OPINPGT
100 KOON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
lar factor is within the heartland given all the facts of the
case. For example, it does not advance the analysis much
to determine that a victim's misconduct might justify a
departure in some aggravated assault cases. What the
district court must determine is whether the misconduct
that occurred in the particular instance suffices to make the
case atypical. The answer is apt to vary depending on,
for instance, the severity of the misconduct, its timing, and
the disruption it causes. These considerations are factual
matters.

This does not mean that district courts do not confront
questions of law in deciding whether to depart. In the
present suit, for example, the Government argues that the
District Court relied on factors that may not be considered
in any case. The Government is quite correct that whether
a factor is a permissible basis for departure under any
circumstances is a question of law, and the court of appeals
need not defer to the district court's resolution of the point.
Little turns, however, on whether we label review of this
particular question abuse of discretion or de novo, for an
abuse-of-discretion standard does not mean a mistake of law
is beyond appellate correction. Cooter & Gell, supra, at 402.
A district court by definition abuses its discretion when
it makes an error of law. 496 U. S., at 405. That a departure decision, in an occasional case, may call for a legal determination does not mean, as a consequence, that parts of
the review must be labeled de novo while other parts are
labeled an abuse of discretion. See id., at 403 (court of
appeals should "appl[y] a unitary abuse-of-discretion standard"). The abuse-of-discretion standard includes review to
determine that the discretion was not guided by erroneous
legal conclusions.

IV

The principles we have explained require us to reverse the
rulings of the Court of Appeals in significant part.

Opinion of the Court

A
The District Court departed downward five levels becauseKing's "wrongful conduct contributed significantly to provoking the offense behavior." 833 F. Supp., at 786. Victimmisconduct was an encouraged basis for departure under the
1992 Guidelines and is so now. 1992 USSG $ 5K2.10; 1995USSG $ 5K2.10.

Most Guidelines prescribe punishment for a single discretestatutory offense or a few similar statutory offenses with
rather predictable fact patterns. Petitioners were con-victed of violating 18 U. S. C. $ 242, however, a statute unusual for its application in so many varied circumstances. Itprohibits, among other things, subjecting any person under
color of law "to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, orimmunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws
of the United States." A violation of $ 242 can arise in amyriad of forms, and the Guideline applicable to the statute
applies to any violation of $ 242 regardless of the form ittakes. 1992 USSG $ 2H1.4. Section 2H1.4 takes account of
the different kinds of conduct that might constitute a $ 242violation by instructing courts to use as a base offense level
the greater of 10, or 6 plus the offense level applicable to anyunderlying offense. In this way, $ 2H1.4 incorporates the
base offense level of the underlying offense; as a conse-quence, the heartland of $ 2H1.4 will vary depending on the
defendant's conduct.Here, the underlying offense was aggravated assault.
After adjusting the offense level for use of a dangerousweapon and bodily injury, see 1992 USSG $ 1B1.5(a) (a Guideline that incorporates another Guideline incorporates as wellthe other's specific offense characteristics), the District
Court added six levels as required by $ 2H1.4. Section2H1.4 adds the six levels to account for the fact that the
offense was committed "under actual or purported legalauthority," commentary to $ 2H1.4, and that "the harm
involved both the underlying conduct and activity intended

102 KOON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
to deprive a person of his civil rights," ibid. (incorporatingintroductory commentary to $ 2H1.1).

The District Court's analysis of this departure factorshowed a correct understanding in applying $ 2H1.4 as a mechanical matter and in interpreting its heartland. Aftersummarizing King's misconduct--his driving while intoxicated, fleeing from the police, refusing to obey the officers'commands, attempting to escape from police custody, etc.--
the District Court concluded that a downward departurepursuant to $ 5K2.10 was justified:

"Mr. King's provocative behavior eventually subsided.The Court recognizes that by the time the defendants'
conduct crossed the line to unlawfulness, Mr. King wasno longer resisting arrest. He posed no objective
threat, and the defendants had no reasonable perceptionof danger. Nevertheless, the incident would not have
escalated to this point, indeed it would not have oc-curred at all, but for Mr. King's initial misconduct."
833 F. Supp., at 787.
The court placed these facts within the context of the rele-vant Guideline range:

"Messrs. Koon and Powell were convicted of conductwhich began as a legal use of force against a resistant
suspect and subsequently crossed the line to unlawful-ness, all in a matter of seconds, during the course of a
dynamic arrest situation. However, the convicted of-fenses fall under the same Guideline Sections that would
apply to a jailor, correctional officer, police officer orother state agent who intentionally used a dangerous
weapon to assault an inmate, without legitimate causeto initiate a use of force.

"The two situations are clearly different. Police offi-cers are always armed with `dangerous weapons' and
may legitimately employ those weapons to administerreasonable force. Where an officer's initial use of force

103Cite as: 518 U. S. 81 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
is provoked and lawful, the line between a legal arrestand an unlawful deprivation of civil rights within the

aggravated assault Guideline is relatively thin. Thestringent aggravated assault Guideline, along with its
upward adjustments for use of a deadly weapon andbodily injury, contemplates a range of offenses involving
deliberate and unprovoked assaultive conduct. TheGuidelines do not adequately account for the differences
between such `heartland' offenses and the case athand."

Ibid.

The Court of Appeals rejected this analysis. It inter-preted the District Court to have found that King had been

the but-for cause of the crime, not that he had provoked it.According to the Court of Appeals, the District Court "ultimately focused not on provocation itself but rather on thevolatility of the incident, and the close proximity between,
on the one hand, the victim's misconduct and the officers'concomitant lawful use of force, and, on the other hand, the
appellants' unlawful use or authorization of the use of force."34 F. 3d, at 1459. The Court of Appeals thought these considerations did not justify departure for victim misconduct.It first quoted the test this Court formulated for excessive
force cases under the Fourth Amendment:

" `The calculus of reasonableness must embody allow-ance for the fact that police officers are often forced

to make split-second judgments--in circumstances thatare tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving--about the
amount of force that is necessary in a particular situa-tion.' " Ibid. (quoting Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386,
396-397 (1989)).
The Court of Appeals reasoned that "before a use of forcecan be found excessive, the

Graham `calculus,' embracing thevery factor which the district court found to be unusual in

this case--the `dynamic arrest situation'--has been takeninto consideration." 34 F. 3d, at 1459. Indeed, it noted the

518us1$71l 05-19-99 16:40:35 PAGES OPINPGT
104 KOON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
jury not only had to take the Graham factors into account,but also, to establish criminal liability, had to conclude that

the petitioners "willfully came down on the wrong side ofthe

Graham standard." 34 F. 3d, at 1459 (emphasis in original). The Court of Appeals concluded that "the feature
which the district court found unusual, and exculpatory,is built into the most fundamental structure of excessive

force jurisprudence, and in criminal cases is built in twice."
Ibid.

The court misinterpreted both the District Court's opinionand the heartland of the applicable Guideline range. The

District Court's observation that the incident would not have
occurred at all "but for" King's misconduct does not alter
the further ruling that King provoked petitioners' illegal use
of force. At the outset of its analysis, the District Court
stated: "[T]he Court finds, and considers as a mitigating circumstance, that Mr. King's wrongful conduct contributed
significantly to provoking the offense behavior." 833 F.
Supp., at 786. It later discussed "Mr. King's wrongdoing
and the substantial role it played in bringing about the defendants' unlawful conduct." Id., at 787. Indeed, a finding
that King's misconduct provoked lawful force but not the
unlawful force that followed without interruption would be
a startling interpretation and contrary to ordinary understandings of provocation. A response need not immediately
follow an action in order to be provoked by it. The Commission recognized this when it noted that although victim misconduct would rarely be a basis for departure in a nonviolent
offense, "an extended course of provocation and harassment
might lead a defendant to steal or destroy property in retaliation." 1992 USSG $ 5K2.10. Furthermore, even if an
immediate response were required by $ 5K2.10, it occurred
here: The excessive force followed within seconds of King's
misconduct.

The Court of Appeals misinterpreted the heartland of

$ 2H1.4 by concentrating on whether King's misconduct

105Cite as: 518 U. S. 81 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
made this an unusual case of excessive force. If $ 2H1.4 cov-ered punishment only for excessive force cases, it might well

be a close question whether victim misconduct of this kindwould be sufficient to take the case out of the heartland.
Section 2H1.4 is not so designed, however. It incorporates
the Guideline for the underlying offense, here $ 2A2.2 for ag-gravated assault, and thus creates a Guideline range and a

heartland for aggravated assault committed under color oflaw. As the District Court was correct to point out, the
same Guideline range applies both to a government officialwho assaults a citizen without provocation as well as instances like this where what begins as legitimate force becomes excessive. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in differentiating between the classes of cases, nor
did it do so in concluding that unprovoked assaults constitute
the relevant heartland. Victim misconduct is an encouraged
ground for departure. A district court, without question,
would have had discretion to conclude that victim misconduct could take an aggravated assault case outside the heartland of $ 2A2.2. That petitioners' aggravated assaults were
committed under color of law does not change the analysis.
The Court of Appeals thought that it did because $ 2H1.4
"explicitly enhances sentences for official misconduct beyond
those for civilian misconduct." 34 F. 3d, at 1460. The
statement is a non sequitur. Section 2H1.4 imposes a sixlevel increase regardless of whether the government official's
aggravated assault is provoked or unprovoked. Aggravated
assault committed under color of law always will be punished
more severely than ordinary aggravated assault. The District Court did not compare civilian offenders with official
offenders; it compared official offenders who are provoked
with official offenders who are not. That was the correct
inquiry. The punishment prescribed by $ 2A2.2 contemplates unprovoked assaults, and as a consequence, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in departing downward for King's misconduct in provoking the wrong.

Opinion of the Court

B
We turn now to the three-level departure. As an initialmatter, the Government urges us to hold each of the factors

relied upon by the District Court to be impermissible depar-ture factors under all circumstances. A defendant's loss of
career opportunities must always be an improper consid-eration, the Government argues, because "persons convicted
of crimes suffer a wide range of consequences in addition tothe sentence." Brief for United States 38. Susceptibility
to prison abuse, continues the Government, likewise nevershould be considered because the "degree of vulnerability to
assault is an entirely `subjective' judgment, and the numberof defendants who may qualify for that departure is `virtually unlimited.' " Id., at 39 (quoting 34 F. 3d, at 1455). Andso on.

Those arguments, however persuasive as a matter of sen-tencing policy, should be directed to the Commission. Congress did not grant federal courts authority to decide whatsorts of sentencing considerations are inappropriate in every
circumstance. Rather, 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(b) instructs a courtthat, in determining whether there exists an aggravating or
mitigating circumstance of a kind or to a degree not ade-quately considered by the Commission, it should consider
"only the sentencing guidelines, policy statements, and offi-cial commentary of the Sentencing Commission." The
Guidelines, however, "place essentially no limit on the num-ber of potential factors that may warrant a departure."
Burns v. United States, 501 U. S. 129, 136-137 (1991). TheCommission set forth factors courts may not consider under
any circumstances but made clear that with those exceptions, it "does not intend to limit the kinds of factors,whether or not mentioned anywhere else in the guidelines,

that could constitute grounds for departure in an unusualcase." 1995 USSG ch. I, pt. A, intro. comment. 4(b). Thus,
for the courts to conclude a factor must not be considered

107Cite as: 518 U. S. 81 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
under any circumstances would be to transgress the policy-making authority vested in the Commission.

An example is helpful. In United States v. Lara, 905 F. 2d599 (1990), the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld a District Court's downward departure based on thedefendant's "potential for victimization" in prison due to his
diminutive size, immature appearance, and bisexual orienta-tion.

Id., at 601. In what appeared to be a response toLara, the Commission amended 1989 USSG $ 5H1.4, to make

[p]hysicial . . . appearance, including physique," a discouragedfactor. 1995 USSG App. C, Amdt. 386 (effective Nov. 1,
1991). The Commission did not see fit, however, to prohibitconsideration of physical appearance in all cases, nor did it
address the broader category of susceptibility to abuse inprison. By urging us to hold susceptibility to abuse in
prison to be an impermissible factor in all cases, the Govern-ment would have us reject the Commission's considered
judgment in favor of our own.The Government acknowledges as much but says its position is required by 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(a)(2). The statuteprovides:

"The court, in determining the particular sentence to beimposed, shall consider--

. . . . .
"(2) the need for the sentence imposed--
"(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promoterespect for the law, and to provide just punishment for

the offense;
"(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;
"(C) to protect the public from further crimes of thedefendant; and

"(D) to provide the defendant with needed educationalor vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner."

108 KOON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Echoing the Court of Appeals, the Government interprets$ 3553(a)(2) to direct courts to test potential departure factors against its broad sentencing goals and to reject, as acategorical matter, factors that are inconsistent with them.
The Government and the Court of Appeals read too much
into $ 3553(a)(2). The statute requires a court to considerthe listed goals in determining "the particular sentence to

be imposed." The wording suggests that the goals shouldbe considered in determining which sentence to choose from
a given Guideline range or from outside the range, if a depar-ture is appropriate. The statute says nothing about requiring each potential departure factor to advance one of the
specified goals. So long as the overall sentence is "sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply" with the
above-listed goals, the statute is satisfied. $ 3553(a).

Even if the text of the statute were ambiguous, we would
reject the Government's interpretation. The Government's
theory--that $ 3553(a)(2) directs courts to decide for themselves, by reference to the broad, open-ended goals of the
provision, whether a given factor ever can be an appropriate
sentencing consideration--would impose widespread judicial
control over sentencing policy. This in turn would nullify
the Commission's treatment of particular departure factors
and its determination that, with few exceptions, departure
factors should not be ruled out on a categorical basis. The
sparse text of $ 3553(a)(2) cannot support this implausible result. Congress created the Commission to "establish sentencing policies and practices for the Federal criminal justice
system," 28 U. S. C. $ 991(b)(1), and Congress instructed the
Commission, not the courts, to "review and revise" the
Guidelines periodically, $ 994(o). As a result, the Commission has assumed that its role is "over time [to] . . . refine the
guidelines to specify more precisely when departures should
and should not be permitted." 1992 USSG ch. I, pt. A, intro.
comment. 4(b). Had Congress intended the courts to supervise the Commission's treatment of departure factors, we ex518us1$71l 05-19-99 16:40:35 PAGES OPINPGT

109Cite as: 518 U. S. 81 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
pect it would have said so in a clear way. It did not, and wewill not assume this role.

We conclude, then, that a federal court's examination ofwhether a factor can ever be an appropriate basis for departure is limited to determining whether the Commission hasproscribed, as a categorical matter, consideration of the factor. If the answer to the question is no--as it will be mostof the time--the sentencing court must determine whether
the factor, as occurring in the particular circumstances, takesthe case outside the heartland of the applicable Guideline.
We now turn to the four factors underlying the DistrictCourt's three-level departure.

1
The first question is whether the District Court abused itsdiscretion in relying on the collateral employment consequences petitioners would face as a result of their convic-tions. The District Court stated:

"Defendants Koon and Powell will be subjected to amultiplicity of adversarial proceedings. The LAPD
Board of Rights will charge Koon and Powell with a fel-ony conviction and, in a quasi-judicial proceeding, will
strip them of their positions and tenure. Koon andPowell will be disqualified from other law enforcement
careers. In combination, the additional proceedings,the loss of employment and tenure, prospective disqualification from the field of law enforcement, and theanguish and disgrace these deprivations entail, will constitute substantial punishment in addition to any court-imposed sentence. In short, because Koon and Powell
are police officers, certain unique burdens flow fromtheir convictions." 833 F. Supp., at 789 (footnotes
omitted).
The Court of Appeals rejected the District Court's analy-sis, noting among other things the "ease with which this fac518us1$71l 05-19-99 16:40:35 PAGES OPINPGT
110 KOON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
tor can be used to justify departures that are based, eitherconsciously or unconsciously, on the defendant's socioeconomic status, a factor that is never a permissible basis forreview." 34 F. 3d, at 1454. We agree with the Court of
Appeals that a defendant's career may relate to his or her
socioeconomic status, but the link is not so close as to justifycategorical exclusion of the effect of conviction on a career.

Although an impermissible factor need not be invoked byname to be rejected, socioeconomic status and job loss are
not the semantic or practical equivalents of each other.We nonetheless conclude that the District Court abused
its discretion by considering petitioners' career loss because
the factor, as it exists in these circumstances, cannot take
the suit out of the heartland of 1992 USSG $ 2H1.4. As
noted above, 18 U. S. C. $ 242 offenses may take a variety of
forms, but they must involve willful violations of rights
under color of law. Although cognizant of the deference
owed to the District Court, we must conclude it is not unusual for a public official who is convicted of using his governmental authority to violate a person's rights to lose his
or her job and to be barred from future work in that field.
Indeed, many public employees are subject to termination
and are prevented from obtaining future government employment following conviction of a serious crime, whether or
not the crime relates to their employment. See Cal. Govt.
Code Ann. $ 19572(k) (West 1995) ("Conviction of a felony
or conviction of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude"
constitutes cause for dismissal); $ 18935(f) (State Personnel
Board may refuse to declare eligible for state employment
one who has "been convicted of a felony, or convicted of a
misdemeanor involving moral turpitude"); Ky. Rev. Stat.
Ann. 18A.146(2) (Michie 1992); 4 Pa. Code $ 7.173 (1995).
Public officials convicted of violating $ 242 have done more
than engage in serious criminal conduct; they have done
so under color of the law they have sworn to uphold. It is
to be expected that a government official would be subject

111Cite as: 518 U. S. 81 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
to the career-related consequences petitioners faced afterviolating $ 242, so we conclude these consequences were

adequately considered by the Commission in formulating$ 2H1.4.

2
We further agree with the Court of Appeals that the lowlikelihood of petitioners' recidivism was not an appropriate

basis for departure. Petitioners were first-time offendersand so were classified in criminal history category I. The
District Court found that "[w]ithin Criminal History Cate-gory I, the Guidelines do not adequately distinguish defendants who, for a variety of reasons, are particularly unlikelyto commit crimes in the future. Here, the need to protect
the public from the defendants' future criminal conduct isabsent `to a degree' not contemplated by the Guidelines."
833 F. Supp., at 790, n. 20. The District Court failed to ac-count for the Commission's specific treatment of this issue,
however. After explaining that a district court may departupward from the highest criminal offense category, the Commission stated:

"However, this provision is not symmetrical. The lowerlimit of the range for Criminal History Category I is set

for a first offender with the lowest risk of recidivism.Therefore, a departure below the lower limit of the
guideline range for Criminal History Category I on thebasis of the adequacy of criminal history cannot be appropriate." 1992 USSG $ 4A1.3.
The District Court abused its discretion by considering ap-pellants' low likelihood of recidivism. The Commission took

that factor into account in formulating the criminal historycategory.

3
The two remaining factors are susceptibility to abuse inprison and successive prosecutions. The District Court did

not abuse its discretion in considering these factors. The

518us1$71l 05-19-99 16:40:35 PAGES OPINPGT
112 KOON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Court of Appeals did not dispute, and neither do we, the
District Court's finding that "[t]he extraordinary notoriety
and national media coverage of this case, coupled with the
defendants' status as police officers, make Koon and Powell
unusually susceptible to prison abuse," 833 F. Supp., at
785-786. Petitioners' crimes, however brutal, were by
definition the same for purposes of sentencing law as those
of any other police officers convicted under 18 U. S. C. $ 242
of using unreasonable force in arresting a suspect, sentenced
under $ 2H1.4, and receiving the upward adjustments petitioners received. Had the crimes been still more severe,
petitioners would have been assigned a different base offense
level or received additional upward adjustments. Yet, due
in large part to the existence of the videotape and all the
events that ensued, "widespread publicity and emotional outrage . . . have surrounded this case from the outset," 833
F. Supp., at 788, which led the District Court to find petitioners "particularly likely to be targets of abuse during their
incarceration," ibid. The District Court's conclusion that
this factor made the case unusual is just the sort of determination that must be accorded deference by the appellate
courts.

As for petitioners' successive prosecutions, it is true that
consideration of this factor could be incongruous with the
dual responsibilities of citizenship in our federal system in
some instances. Successive state and federal prosecutions
do not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. Heath v. Alabama, 474 U. S. 82 (1985). Nonetheless, the District Court
did not abuse its discretion in determining that a "federal
conviction following a state acquittal based on the same
underlying conduct . . . significantly burden[ed] the defendants." 833 F. Supp., at 790. The state trial was lengthy,
and the toll it took is not beyond the cognizance of the
District Court.

Opinion of the Court

V
The goal of the Sentencing Guidelines is, of course, to re-duce unjustified disparities and so reach toward the evenhandedness and neutrality that are the distinguishing marksof any principled system of justice. In this respect, the
Guidelines provide uniformity, predictability, and a degree ofdetachment lacking in our earlier system. This, too, must
be remembered, however. It has been uniform and constantin the federal judicial tradition for the sentencing judge to
consider every convicted person as an individual and everycase as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes
mitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the punishmentto ensue. We do not understand it to have been the congressional purpose to withdraw all sentencing discretion fromthe United States district judge. Discretion is reserved
within the Sentencing Guidelines, and reflected by the stand-ard of appellate review we adopt.

* * *
The Court of Appeals identified the wrong standard of re-view. It erred as well in finding that victim misconduct did

not justify the five-level departure and that susceptibility toprison abuse and the burdens of successive prosecutions
could not be relied upon for the three-level departure.Those sentencing determinations were well within the sound
discretion of the District Court. The District Court didabuse its discretion in relying on the other two factors forming the three-level departure: career loss and low recidivismrisk. When a reviewing court concludes that a district court
based a departure on both valid and invalid factors, a remandis required unless it determines the district court would have
imposed the same sentence absent reliance on the invalidfactors.

Williams, 503 U. S., at 203. As the District Courthere stated that none of the four factors standing alone

would justify the three-level departure, it is not evident that

the court would have imposed the same sentence if it hadrelied only on susceptibility to abuse in prison and the hardship of successive prosecutions. The Court of Appealsshould therefore remand the case to the District Court.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in part
and reversed in part, and the cases are remanded for furtherproceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, concurring in part and dissenting inpart.

In my opinion the District Court did not abuse its discre-tion when it relied on the unusual collateral employment consequences faced by these petitioners as a result of theirconvictions. I therefore except Part IV-B-1 from my otherwise complete endorsement of the Court's opinion. I also
note that I do not understand the opinion to foreclose theDistrict Court from basing a downward departure on an

aggregation of factors each of which might in itself be
insufficient to justify a departure.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,
concurring in part and dissenting in part.

I agree with the way today's opinion describes a district
court's tasks in sentencing under the Guidelines, and the role
of a court of appeals in reviewing sentences, but I part company from the Court in applying its standard on two specific
points. I would affirm the Court of Appeals's rejection of
the downward departures based on susceptibility to abuse in
prison and on successive prosecution, for to do otherwise
would be to attribute an element of irrationality to the
Commission and to its "heartland" concept. Accordingly, I
join the Court's opinion except Part IV-B-3.

As the majority notes, ante, at 106, "Congress did not grant
federal courts authority to decide what sorts of sentencing
considerations are inappropriate in every circumstance." In

fact, Congress allowed district courts to depart from theGuidelines only if "the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree,not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing
Commission in formulating the guidelines that should resultin a sentence different from that described." 18 U. S. C.

$ 3553(b); see also ante, at 92-93. While discussing depar-tures, the Commission quotes this language from $ 3553(b),
before stating that "[w]hen a court finds an atypical case, . . .the court may consider whether a departure is warranted."
United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manualch. 1, pt. A, intro. comment. 4(b) (Nov. 1995) (1995 USSG).
Thus, both Congress and the Commission envisioned that de-partures would require some unusual factual circumstance,
but would be justified only if the factual difference "should"result in a different sentence. Departures, in other words,
must be consistent with rational normative order.As to the consideration of susceptibility to abuse in prison,
the District Court departed downward because it believedthat "the widespread publicity and emotional outrage which
have surrounded this case from the outset, in addition to the[petitioners'] status as police officers, lead the Court to find
that Koon and Powell are particularly likely to be targets ofabuse during their incarceration." 833 F. Supp. 769, 788
(CD Cal. 1993). That is, the District Court concluded thatpetitioners would be subject to abuse not simply because
they were former police officers, but in large part because ofthe degree of publicity and condemnation surrounding their
crime.1 But that reasoning overlooks the fact that the pub-licity stemmed from the remarkable brutality of petitioners'
proven behavior, which it was their misfortune to have pre1 Although it is not essential to my analysis, I note in passing that the
unusual extent of outside publicity is probably irrelevant in the prison
environment. Given any amount of outside publicity, prison inmates
quickly learn about new arrivals, including former police officers, and the
crimes of which they were convicted.

cisely documented on film. To allow a departure on thisbasis is to reason, in effect, that the more serious the crime,

and the more widespread its consequent publicity and con-demnation, the less one should be punished; the more egregious the act, the less culpable the offender. In the terminology of the Guidelines, such reasoning would take theheartland to be the domain of the less, not the more, deplorable of the acts that might come within the statute. Thismoral irrationality cannot be attributed to the heartland
scheme, however, and rewarding the relatively severe of-fender could hardly have been in the contemplation of a Commission that discouraged downward departures for suscepti-bility to prison abuse even when the nonculpable reason is
an unusual "[p]hysical . . . appearance, including physique."
1995 USSG $ 5H1.4; see also ante, at 107; 1995 USSG ch. 1,pt. A, intro. comment. 3 (discussing the principle of " `just

deserts,' " which the Commission describes as a conceptunder which "punishment should be scaled to the offender's
culpability and the resulting harms").2The Court of Appeals appreciated the significance of the
requisite moral calculus when it wrote that "[a]ny public out-rage was the direct result of [petitioners'] criminal acts. It
is incongruous and inappropriate to reduce [petitioners'] sen-tences specifically because individuals in society have condemned their acts as criminal and an abuse of the trust thatsociety placed in them." 34 F. 3d 1416, 1456 (CA9 1994).
The Court of Appeals should be affirmed on this point.I believe that it was also an abuse of discretion for the
District Court to depart downward because of the successive
prosecutions.3 In these cases, there were facial showings

2 The requirement of normative order does not, of course, say anything
one way or the other about considering exceptionally unusual physical
appearance as a basis to anticipate abuse.

3 It is true, factually, that successive federal prosecutions after state

proceedings occur very rarely even in criminal civil rights prosecutions,

that the state court system had malfunctioned when the peti-tioners were acquitted (or, in the case of one charge, had

received no verdict), and without something more one cannotaccept the District Court's conclusion that there was no demonstration that a "clear miscarriage of justice" caused the
result in the state trial. 833 F. Supp., at 790. This is sosimply because the federal prosecutors, in proving their

cases, proved conduct constituting the crimes for which petitioners had been prosecuted unsuccessfully in the state
court. See Powell v. Superior Court, 232 Cal. App. 3d 785,
789, 283 Cal. Rptr. 777, 779 (1991) (noting that petitioners
were charged, inter alia, with assault by force likely to
produce great bodily injury, Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 245(a)(1)
(West 1988), and being an officer unnecessarily assaulting or
beating any person in violation of $ 149); $ 149 ("Every public
officer who, under color of authority, without lawful necessity, assaults or beats any person" commits an offense);

$ 245(a)(1) ("Every person who commits an assault upon the
person of another . . . by any means of force likely to produce
great bodily injury" commits an offense); ante, at 87-88 (observing that petitioners were tried in state court for assault
with a deadly weapon and excessive use of force by a police
officer and tried in federal court for willfully using or willfully allowing others to use unreasonable force in arresting
King); 833 F. Supp., at 790 (stating that the "same underlying
conduct" was involved in both cases). While such a facial
showing resulting from the identity of factual predicates for
the state and federal prosecutions might in some cases be
overcome (by demonstrating, say, that a crucial witness for

are brought each year and that from March 1977 to September 1980 only
seven successive prosecutions were authorized); United States v. Davis,
906 F. 2d 829, 832 (CA2 1990) ("In practice, successive prosecutions for the
same conduct remain rarities"). Those figures do not, however, demonstrate that all convictions on successive federal prosecutions under 18
U. S. C. $ 242 should for that reason be subject to discretion to depart
downward, for they do not take account of the normative ordering, discussed below.

the State was unavailable in the state trial through no one'sfault), there was no evidence to overcome it here.

As a consequence, reading the Guidelines to suggest thatthose who profit from state-court malfunctions should get
the benefit of a downward departure would again attribute
a normative irrationality to the heartland concept. Thesense of irrationality here is, to be sure, different from what

was presupposed by the District Court's analysis on the issueof susceptibility to abuse in prison, for the incongruity
produced by downward departures here need not depend onthe defendant's responsibility for the particular malfunction
of the state system. But the fact remains that it would bea normatively obtuse sentencing scheme that would reward
a defendant whose federal prosecution is justified solely because he has obtained the advantage of injustice produced
by the failure of the state system.

This is not, of course, to say that a succession of state and
federal prosecutions may never justify a downward departure. If a comparison of state and federal verdicts in relation to their factual predicates indicates no incongruity, a
downward departure at federal sentencing could well be consistent with an application of a rational heartland concept.
But these are not such cases.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,
concurring in part and dissenting in part.

I join the Court's opinion with the exception of Part IV-
B-3. I agree with Justice Souter's conclusion in respect
to that section. The record here does not support departures based upon either the simple fact of two prosecutions
or the risk of mistreatment in prison.

In my view, the relevant Guideline, 1992 USSG $ 2H1.4,
encompasses the possibility of a double prosecution. That
Guideline applies to various civil rights statutes, which Congress enacted, in part, to provide a federal forum for the
protection of constitutional rights where state law enforce518us1$71q 05-19-99 16:40:35 PAGES OPINPGT

ment efforts had proved inadequate. See, e. g., Ngiraingasv. Sanchez, 495 U. S. 182, 187-189 (1990); Monroe v. Pape, 365

U. S. 167, 171-180 (1961); Screws v. United States, 325 U. S.91, 131-134 (1945) (Rutledge, J., concurring in result). Before promulgating the Guidelines, the Commission "exam-ined the many hundreds of criminal statutes in the United
States Code," 1995 USSG ch. 1, pt. A, intro. comment. 5,and it would likely have been aware of this well-known legislative purpose. The centrality of this purpose, the Com-mission's likely awareness of it, and other considerations
that Justice Souter mentions, ante, at 116-118, lead me toconclude on the basis of the statute and Guideline itself,
18 U. S. C. $ 3553(b), that the Commission would have consid-ered a "double prosecution" case as one ordinarily within,
not outside, the "civil rights" Guideline's "heartland." Forthat reason, a simple double prosecution, without more, does
not support a departure. See $ 3553(b) (departures permit-ted only when circumstances were "not adequately taken
into consideration" by the Commission) (emphasis added).The departure on the basis of potential mistreatment in
prison presents a closer question. Nonetheless, differencesin prison treatment are fairly common--to the point where
too frequent use of this factor as a basis for departure couldundermine the uniformity that the Guidelines seek. For
that reason, and others that Justice Souter mentions, ante,at 115-116, I believe that the Guidelines themselves embody
an awareness of potentially harsh (or lenient) treatment inprison, thereby permitting departure on that basis only in a
truly unusual case. Even affording the District Court "duedeference," $ 3742(e), I cannot find in this record anything
sufficiently unusual, compared, say, with other policemen im-prisoned for civil rights violations, as to justify departure.

MELENDEZ v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 95-5661. Argued February 27, 1996--Decided June 17, 1996
After agreeing with others to buy cocaine, petitioner was charged with a

conspiracy violative of 21 U. S. C. $ 846, which carries a statutory minimum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment. He ultimately signed a plea
agreement providing, inter alia, that in return for his cooperation with
the Government's investigation and his guilty plea, the Government
would move the sentencing court, pursuant to $ 5K1.1 of the United
States Sentencing Guidelines, to depart downward from the otherwise
applicable Guideline sentencing range, which turned out to be 135 to 168
months' imprisonment. Although the agreement noted the applicability
of the 10-year statutory minimum sentence, neither it nor the ensuing

$ 5K1.1 motion mentioned departure below that minimum. Pursuant to
the motion, the District Court departed downward from the Guideline
range in sentencing petitioner. It also ruled, however, that it had no
authority to depart below the statutory minimum because the Government had not made a motion, pursuant to 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(e), that it
do so. It thus sentenced petitioner to 10 years, and the Third Circuit
affirmed.

Held: A Government motion attesting to the defendant's substantial assistance in a criminal investigation and requesting that the district court
depart below the minimum of the applicable Guideline sentencing range

minimum sentence. Pp. 124-131.

(a) Guideline $ 5K1.1 does not create a "unitary" motion system.
Title 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(e) requires a Government motion requesting or
authorizing the district court to "impose a sentence below a level established by statute as minimum sentence" before the court may impose
such a sentence. Nothing in $ 3553(e) suggests that a district court has
the power to impose such a sentence when the Government has not
authorized it, but has instead moved for a departure only from the applicable Guidelines range. Nor does anything in $ 3553(e) or 28 U. S. C.

$ 994(n) suggest that the Commission itself may dispense with $ 3553(e)'s
motion requirement or, alternatively, "deem" a motion requesting or
authorizing different action--such as a departure below the Guidelines
minimum--to be a motion authorizing departure below the statutory
minimum. Section 5K1.1 cannot be read as attempting to exercise this
nonexistent authority. That section states that "[u]pon motion of the

Application Note 1 declares that "[u]nder circumstances set forth in . . .

$ 3553(e) and . . . $ 994(n) . . . substantial assistance . . . may justify a
sentence below a statutorily required minimum sentence." One of the
circumstances set forth in $ 3553(e) is that the Government has authorized the court to impose such a sentence. The Government is correct
that the relevant statutory provisions merely charge the Commission
with constraining the district court's discretion in choosing a specific
sentence once the Government has moved for a departure below the
statutory minimum, not with "implementing" $ 3553(e)'s motion requirement, and that $ 5K1.1 does not improperly attempt to dispense with or
modify that requirement. Pp. 124-130.

(b) For two reasons, the Court need not decide whether the Government is correct in reading $ 994(n) to permit the Commission to construct a unitary motion system by providing that the district court may
depart below the Guidelines range only when the Government is willing
to authorize the court to depart below the statutory minimum, if the
court finds that to be appropriate. First, even if the Commission had
done so, that would not help petitioner, since the Government has not
authorized a departure below the statutory minimum here. Second, the
Commission has not adopted this type of unitary system. Pp. 130-131.

122 MELENDEZ v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
The issue here is whether a Government motion attesting
to the defendant's substantial assistance in a criminal investigation and requesting that the district court depart below
the minimum of the applicable sentencing range under the
Sentencing Guidelines also permits the district court to depart below any statutory minimum sentence. We hold that
it does not.

I

Petitioner and several others entered into an agreement
to buy cocaine from confidential informants of the United
States Customs Service. As a result, petitioner was
charged with conspiring to distribute and to possess with
intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, see

$ 406, 84 Stat. 1265, as amended, 21 U. S. C. $ 846, a crime
that carries a statutory minimum sentence of 10 years'
imprisonment, see $ 841(b)(1)(A). Plea negotiations ensued,
and petitioner ultimately signed a cooperating plea agreement. The agreement provided, in pertinent part, that in
return for petitioner's cooperation with the Government's investigation and his guilty plea, the Government would "move
the sentencing court, pursuant to Section 5K1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines, to depart from the otherwise applicable
guideline range." App. 9. The agreement noted that the
offense to which petitioner would plead guilty "carries a statutory mandatory minimum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment." Id., at 6. The agreement did not require the Government to authorize the District Court to impose a sentence
below the statutory minimum, nor did it specifically state
that the Government would oppose departure below the statutory minimum.

Petitioner pleaded guilty to the charged conspiracy. The
probation officer determined that the Guideline sentencing
range applicable to petitioner's crime was 135 to 168 months'
imprisonment. In a letter to the court, the Government described the assistance rendered by petitioner and moved the

Opinion of the Court
court to impose "a sentence lower than what the [c]ourt ha[d]determined to be the otherwise applicable [sic] under the

sentencing guidelines." Id., at 13-14. The letter specifi-cally noted that "[t]his motion is made pursuant to Section
5K1.1." Id., at 13. The Government did not request a sen-tence below the statutory minimum, although, again, it did
not state that the Government opposed such a departure.The District Court granted the Government's motion and departed downward from the sentencing range set by theGuidelines. However, because the Government had not also
moved the District Court to depart below the statutory mini-mum pursuant to 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(e), the court ruled that it
had no authority to so depart; it thus imposed the 10-yearminimum sentence required by statute.

On appeal, petitioner contended that the District Courthad erred in concluding that it had no authority to depart
below the statutory minimum. A $ 5K1.1 motion, he argued,not only allows the court to depart downward from the sentencing level set by the Guidelines but also permits the courtto depart below a lower statutory minimum. See United
States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 5K1.1,p. s. (Nov. 1995) (USSG). A divided panel of the Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected that argument andaffirmed the 10-year sentence. 55 F. 3d 130 (1995). A petition for rehearing was denied, with six judges dissenting.As we noted in

Wade v. United States, 504 U. S. 181, 185(1992), the Courts of Appeals disagree as to whether a Government motion attesting to the defendant's substantial as-sistance and requesting that the district court depart below
the minimum of the applicable sentencing range under theGuidelines also permits the district court to depart below
any statutory minimum.1

Opinion of the Court
We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 516 U. S.963 (1995). We now hold that such a motion does not authorize a departure below a lower statutory minimum.

II
The question presented involves two subsections of federalstatutes and a policy statement of the Guidelines. Title 18

U. S. C. $ 3553(e) provides:

"Limited authority to impose a sentence below a stat-utory minimum.--Upon motion of the Government, the

court shall have the authority to impose a sentencebelow a level established by statute as minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant's substantial assistancein the investigation or prosecution of another person
who has committed an offense. Such sentence shall beimposed in accordance with the guidelines and policy
statements issued by the Sentencing Commission pursu-ant to section 994 of title 28, United States Code."

Title 28 U. S. C. $ 994(n), in turn, states:

"The Commission shall assure that the guidelines re-flect the general appropriateness of imposing a lower

sentence than would otherwise be imposed, includinga sentence that is lower than that established by statute as a minimum sentence, to take into account a de-fendant's substantial assistance in the investigation or
prosecution of another person who has committed anoffense."

Finally, the text of $ 5K1.1 of the Guidelines provides:

"Substantial Assistance to Authorities (PolicyStatement)

"Upon motion of the government stating that the de-fendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who hascommitted an offense, the court may depart from the
guidelines.

Opinion of the Court
"(a) The appropriate reduction shall be determined bythe court for reasons stated that may include, but are

not limited to, consideration of the following: [List offive factors for the court's consideration, including] the
government's evaluation of the assistance rendered."
Petitioner argues that $ 5K1.1 creates what he calls a "uni-tary" motion system, in which a motion attesting to the substantial assistance of the defendant and requesting a depar-ture below the Guidelines range also permits a district court
to depart below the statutory minimum.2 The Governmentviews $ 5K1.1 as establishing a binary motion system, which
permits the Government to authorize a departure below theGuidelines range while withholding from the court the authority to depart below a lower statutory minimum. Theparties argue, naturally, that their respective interpretations
of the system actually adopted by the Sentencing Commis-sion were permissible ones under $ 3553(e) and $ 994(n).

3

We believe that $ 3553(e) requires a Government motionrequesting or authorizing the district court to "impose a

sentence below a level established by statute as minimum

2 Petitioner also argues for the first time in his reply brief that the plea
agreement into which he entered was at least ambiguous with respect to
whether it required the Government to move the District Court to depart
below the statutory minimum--and thus that the agreement itself permitted the court to depart below the 10-year minimum. See Reply Brief for
Petitioner 7-8. We do not view this issue as included within the question
upon which we granted certiorari, see Pet. for Cert. 3 ("Did the sentencing
court have the discretion to depart below the applicable statutory minimum once the United States moved for departure under USSG $ 5K1,
without the requirement of a second government departure application
under 18 U. S. C. 3553(e)?"), and petitioner appears to concede that it
is not, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 15. We therefore decline to address the
argument.

3 Although it is plain that under $ 994(n), the Commission was at least

authorized to create a system in which no Government motion of any kind
need be filed before the district court may depart below the Guidelines
minimum, neither party argues that the Commission has created such a
system.

sentence" before the court may impose such a sentence. Pe-titioner and his amici repeatedly characterize the motion required by $ 3553(e) as a "motion that substantial assistancehas occurred," Brief for Petitioner 12, a "motion acknowledging the defendant's `substantial assistance,' " id., at 8, and thelike. But the term "motion" generally means "[a]n application made to a court or judge for purpose of obtaining a ruleor order directing some act to be done in favor of the applicant." Black's Law Dictionary 1013 (6th ed. 1990).4 Paperssimply "acknowledging" substantial assistance are not sufficient if they do not indicate desire for, or consent to, a sen-tence below the statutory minimum.

5

Of course, the Government did more than simply "ac-knowledge" substantial assistance here: It moved the court

to impose a sentence below the Guideline range. But weagree with the Government that nothing in $ 3553(e) suggests that a district court has power to impose a sentencebelow the statutory minimum to reflect a defendant's cooperation when the Government has not authorized such a sen-tence, but has instead moved for a departure only from the
applicable Guidelines range. Nor does anything in $ 3553(e)or $ 994(n) suggest that the Commission itself may dispense
with $ 3553(e)'s motion requirement or, alternatively, "deem"

4 See also Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1254 (2d
ed. 1987) (defining "motion" in the legal sense as "an application made to
a court or judge for an order, ruling, or the like"); Wade v. United States,
504 U. S. 181, 187 (1992) ("[Substantial assistance] is a necessary condition
for [a departure, but] it is not a sufficient one. The Government's decision
not to move may have been based not on a failure to acknowledge or
appreciate [the defendant's] help, but simply on its rational assessment of
the cost and benefit that would flow from moving").

5 We do not mean to imply, of course, that specific language (such as that

quoted in text) or, on the other hand, an express reference to $ 3553(e) is
necessarily required before a court may depart below the statutory minimum. Cf. Brief for Petitioner 5-6, 18, 32, 34 (characterizing the opposing
argument in this fashion). But the Government must in some way indicate its desire or consent that the court depart below the statutory minimum before the court may do so.

Opinion of the Court
a motion requesting or authorizing different action--such asa departure below the Guidelines minimum--to be a motion

authorizing the district court to depart below the statutoryminimum.

Moreover, we do not read $ 5K1.1 as attempting to exercisethis nonexistent authority. Section 5K1.1 says: "Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has pro-vided substantial assistance . . . the court may depart from
the guidelines," while its Application Note 1 says: "Undercircumstances set forth in 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(e) and 28 U. S. C.

$ 994(n) . . . substantial assistance . . . may justify a sentencebelow a statutorily required minimum sentence," $ 5K1.1,
comment., n. 1. One of the circumstances set forth in$ 3553(e) is, as we have explained previously, that the Government has authorized the court to impose a sentence belowthe statutory minimum.

Petitioner and his amici argue that $ 3553(e) requires asentence below the statutory minimum to be imposed in
"accordance" with the Guidelines; that $ 994(n) specifically di-rects the Commission to draft a provision covering substantial assistance cases, including cases in which a sentencebelow a statutory minimum is warranted; and that if $ 5K1.1
is not read as creating a unitary motion system, then theCommission has improperly failed to meet its obligation,
because no other provision of the Guidelines implements$ 3553(e) and $ 994(n). They also argue (1) that the reference
to $ 3553(e) in $ 5K1.1's Application Note 1 indicates that$ 5K1.1 is a "conduit" established by the Commission for "implementation" of $ 3553(e); (2) that Application Note 2's useof the broad term "sentencing reduction," rather than "departure from the guidelines range," supports petitioner'sview that $ 5K1.1 authorizes departures below a statutory
minimum; 6 (3) that Application Note 3 makes sense only on

6 Application Note 2 provides in relevant part: "The sentencing reduction for assistance to authorities shall be considered independently of any
reduction for acceptance of responsibility." USSG $ 5K1.1, comment., n. 2.

the assumption that the district court retains "full discre-tionary power" over the extent of the sentencing reduction

(i. e., the authority to choose any sentence once the Govern-ment makes any motion confirming the defendant's substantial assistance); 7 (4) that the reference to $ 5K1.1 alone(rather than to $ 3553(e)) in USSG $ 2D1.1's Application Note
7 further supports petitioner's claim that $ 5K1.1 is a conduitfor implementation of $ 3553(e);

8 and (5) that if the factors

described in $ 5K1.1(a) limiting the district court's discretiondo not apply to sentences imposed after the Government

moves to depart below the statutory minimum, then thedistrict court's discretion will be wholly unlimited in those
circumstances.In the Government's view, $ 3553(e) already gives the district court authority to depart below the statutory minimumon motion to do so by the prosecutor. The Government
urges us to read the last sentence of $ 3553(e), and theinclusion of the phrase "including a sentence that is lower
than that established by statute as a minimum sentence" in$ 994(n), as merely requiring the Commission to constrain the
district court's discretion in choosing a sentence after theGovernment moves to depart below the statutory minimum.
The Government contends that the first paragraph of $ 5K1.1
does not authorize departures below the statutory minimum,but that $ 5K1.1(a) does apply to sentences imposed after the

the government's evaluation of the extent of the defendant's assistance,
particularly where the extent and value of the assistance are difficult to
ascertain." USSG $ 5K1.1, comment., n. 3.

may be `waived' and a lower sentence imposed (including a sentence below
the applicable guideline range), as provided in 28 U. S. C. $ 994(n), by reason of a defendant's `substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.' See $ 5K1.1

Opinion of the Court
Government moves to depart below the statutory minimum(as well as to sentences imposed after the Government

moves to depart below the Guidelines range); $ 5K1.1(a) thusimplements the requirements of $ 3553(e) and $ 994(n) that
relate to sentences below the statutory minimum, by re-quiring the district court to consider the factors listed in

$$ 5K1.1(a)(1)-(5) in determining the appropriate extent ofa departure below the statutory minimum. According to
the Government, the difficulties and gaps referred to by peti-tioner vanish once $ 5K1.1(a) is so construed.

We agree with the Government that the relevant parts ofthe statutes merely charge the Commission with constraining the district court's discretion in choosing a specific sen-tence after the Government moves for a departure below the
statutory minimum.9 Congress did not charge the Commis-sion with "implementing" $ 3553(e)'s Government motion
requirement, beyond adopting provisions constraining thedistrict court's discretion regarding the particular sentence
selected.Although the various relevant Guidelines provisions invoked by the parties could certainly be clearer, we also be-lieve that the Government's interpretation of the current
provisions is the better one. Section 5K1.1(a) may guide thedistrict court when it selects a sentence below the statutory
minimum, as well as when it selects a sentence below theGuidelines range.

10 The Commission has not, however, im9 Notably, $ 3553(e) states that the "sentence" shall be imposed in accordance with the Guidelines and policy statements, not that the "departure"
shall occur, or shall be authorized, in accordance with the Guidelines and
policy statements.

10 Section $ 5K1.1(a) may apply of its own force to sentences below the

statutory minimum, see ibid. (providing that the district court shall determine "[t]he appropriate reduction" by applying a nonexhaustive list
of factors), and both the reference to $ 3553(e) in $ 5K1.1's Application
Note 1 and the reference to $ 5K1.1 in $ 2D1.1's Application Note 7 may
reflect that fact. Or perhaps the phrase "[t]he appropriate reduction" in

$ 5K1.1(a) encompasses only departures below the Guidelines range, but

Opinion of the Court
properly attempted to dispense with or modify the require-ment for a departure below the statutory minimum spelled

out in $ 3553(e)--that of a Government motion requesting orauthorizing a departure below the statutory minimum.

The Government has made no such motion here. Hence,
the District Court correctly concluded that it lacked theauthority to sentence petitioner to less than 10 years'

imprisonment. III

What is at stake in the long run is whether the Govern-ment can make a motion authorizing the district court to
depart below the Guidelines range but withholding from thedistrict court the power to depart below the statutory minimum. Although the Government contends correctly thatthe Commission does not have authority to "deem" a Government motion that does not authorize a departure below thestatutory minimum to be one that does authorize such a departure, the Government apparently reads $ 994(n) to permit
the Commission to construct a unitary motion system by adjusting the requirements for a departure below the Guidelines minimum--that is, by providing that the district courtmay depart below the Guidelines range only when the Government is willing to authorize the court to depart below thestatutory minimum, if the court finds that to be appropriate.
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26-31.We need not decide whether the Commission could create
this second type of unitary motion system, for two reasons.
First, even if the Commission had done so, that would nothelp petitioner, since the Government has not authorized a

departure below the statutory minimum here. Second, weagree with the Government that the Commission has not
adopted this type of unitary motion system. Neither the
the Application Notes are meant to suggest that the court should also
consider the $ 5K1.1(a) factors in the analogous circumstance of a departure below the statutory minimum.

text of $ 5K1.1 nor its commentary expressly limits the au-thority of the court to depart below the Guidelines minimum

to situations in which the Government has moved to departbelow the statutory minimum. The text of $ 5K1.1 says:
"Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant
has provided substantial assistance . . . , the court may de-part from the guidelines." We do not read this sentence to

say: "Upon motion of the government stating that the de-fendant has provided substantial assistance . . . and authorizing the court to depart below the statutory minimum, if any,the court may depart from the guidelines." Rather, we read
it as permitting the district court to depart below the Guide-lines range when the Government states that the defendant
has provided substantial assistance and requests or authorizes the district court to depart below the Guidelines range.
As we have noted, supra, at 127-130, the Application Notes
to $ 5K1.1 and $ 2D1.1 do not compel any other reading.

The judgment is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Souter, concurring.
I agree with the conclusion that 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(e) requires a motion by the Government asking the district court
to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum, but I
part company with the Court on the characterization of the
policy statement numbered $ 5K1.1, United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 5K1.1, p. s. (Nov. 1995)
(USSG). The text of this policy statement deals with departures from the Guidelines; the best reading of each sentence
is that its referent is a Guideline departure, and that neither
directly applies to reductions below mandatory minimums.
The Application Notes (which are "the legal equivalent of a
policy statement," USSG $ 1B1.7) are where the Sentencing
Commission has dealt with sentences below statutory minimums. In my view, the Sentencing Commission has discharged its responsibility under 28 U. S. C. $ 994(n) by its

inclusion of the Application Notes, which effectively tell dis-trict courts that the policy statement applies as well to motions for reductions below mandatory minimums. Thus, mydisagreement is over the suggestion that the two sentences
of $ 5K1.1 can be treated separately. I would simply say
that the Application Notes indicate that $ 5K1.1 applies tomotions under $ 3553(e), and leave it at that.

Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment.
Petitioner has persuaded me that the Sentencing Commis-sion intended $ 5K1.1 to create a unitary motion system

under which any request for a departure below the Guidelinerange based on substantial assistance would also authorize a
departure below the statutory minimum. Such a systemwould be eminently reasonable, but, for two reasons, I am
convinced that Congress did not intend to authorize it.
First, I agree with the Court that the text of $ 3553(e) doesnot authorize the court to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum unless the Government has made a motion
requesting that relief. Second, notwithstanding my serious
doubts concerning the wisdom of a congressional decision to
impose statutory minimum sentences higher than those considered appropriate by the Commission, the very fact that
Congress has done so indicates that it intended to confer the
authority to dispense with the statutory minima on the
prosecutor rather than the Commission.

Thus, I concur in the judgment because I agree with the
Court's interpretation of $ 3553(e).

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,
concurring in part and dissenting in part.

I join Parts I and II of the Court's opinion, for, like the
Court, I believe the Commission does not have the power to
modify Congress' statutes. I disagree with Part III, however, because the Commission does have the power to write
its own Guidelines and, in my view, the Commission has in

Opinion of Breyer, J.
fact exercised that power to create what the Court calls a"unitary motion system."

To understand that system, one must keep in mind twofacts. First, many "substantial assistance" departures involve departures only from Guideline sentences, not from
statutory mandatory minimum sentences. When a defend-ant seeks a "substantial assistance" departure from the minimum Guideline sentence for robbery, fraud, money launder-ing, tax evasion, or most other offenses, the defendant need
not worry about a statutorily required minimum sentence,for either no such minimum sentence applies, or that sentence is so far below the minimum Guideline sentence that
there is no practical likelihood of a departure drastic enough
to make it relevant. The Guidelines govern departures from
these Guideline sentences, and they permit judges to depart
downward for "substantial assistance" only if the Government makes a "motion . . . stating that the defendant has
provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense."
United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual

$ 5K1.1, p. s. (Nov. 1995) (USSG). I call the policy statement
that sets forth this rule the "Substantial Assistance
Guideline."

Second, some criminal convictions implicate not only the
Guidelines, but also the special statutes (applicable particularly to drug and weapon offenses) that set "mandatory minimum" sentences. See United States Sentencing Commission, Mandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal
Justice System, App. A, pp. A1-A8 (Aug. 1991) (Mandatory
Minimum Penalties). The law does not normally permit a
departure below such mandatory statutory minimums. But
cf. 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(f) (limitation on applicability of statutory minimums in certain cases); USSG $ 5C1.2 (same). The
law does permit such a departure, however, for one special
reason, namely, "substantial assistance," but only if the Government makes a "motion . . . so as to reflect a defendant's

substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution ofanother person who has committed an offense." 18 U. S. C.

$ 3553(e). I shall call the statute that states this rule the"Substantial Assistance Statute."

With these two basic facts in mind, one might ask what
the Commission means by the term "substantial assistance"in its Substantial Assistance Guideline. In particular, do

those words in that Guideline mean the same thing thatthose same words mean in the Substantial Assistance Statute? Or does the Commission intend those words in itsGuideline to create a tougher, or perhaps a more lenient,
standard where departures from Guideline minimums
(rather than departures from statutory minimums) are at
issue?

The answer to this interpretive question, in my view, is
that the Commission means the term "substantial assistance" in its Substantial Assistance Guideline to create the
same standard that the Substantial Assistance Statute creates using the same words. As so interpreted, the Guideline
authorizes a sentencing judge to depart downward from a
Guideline sentence for substantial assistance only if the Government files the same kind of motion that the Government
would file to obtain a departure from a statutory minimum
sentence, were such a sentence at issue.

My reasons for believing that the Commission intended to
tie its Substantial Assistance Guideline to the Substantial
Assistance Statute (thereby recognizing one kind of "substantial assistance," not two) are the following: First, as I
have said, the language the Commission used to write its
Substantial Assistance Guideline is virtually identical to the
language that appears in the Substantial Assistance Statute.
Compare USSG $ 5K1.1, p. s., with 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(e). Second, the Commission nowhere suggests that the key words
"substantial assistance" mean something different in the two
places (the Guideline and the Statute) where they appear,
and I cannot imagine any reason why the Commission would

Opinion of Breyer, J.
have wanted to create different standards through the use ofidentical words, thereby creating additional administrative

complexity and risking unnecessary confusion. Third, theCommission's commentary refers to statutory and guideline
departures indiscriminately. USSG $ 2D1.1, comment., n. 7
(citing Substantial Assistance Guideline for proposition thatstatutory minimum may be "waived"); see also Mandatory

Minimum Penalties, supra, at 59 (discussing unitary "sub-stantial assistance motions").

The Court's reason for reaching the contrary conclusion isthat the Commission did not specify that courts could not
depart below a minimum Guideline sentence without a Government motion for departure below any applicable statutory minimum. That is, the Substantial Assistance Guideline does not say: "Upon motion of the government stating
that the defendant has provided substantial assistance . . .
and authorizing the court to depart below the statutory minimum, if any, the court may depart from the guidelines."
Ante, at 131 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted). But it is not surprising that the Commission neglected
to add these words of crystal clarity to the Substantial Assistance Guideline, since that Guideline governs many cases
that have nothing to do with mandatory minimum sentences.
It makes sense, instead, for the Commission to have noted
the interplay of "substantial assistance" and statutory minimums in its commentary to the Substantial Assistance
Guideline, see USSG $ 5K1.1, p. s., comment., n. 1, and in its
section on drug offenses, for which statutory minimums are
relatively common, see id., $ 2D1.1, comment., n. 7.

I recognize that the Court, through its interpretation of
the Guideline, avoids having to decide "whether the Commission could create this . . . unitary motion system." Ante, at
130. But the legal question it avoids is not a difficult one.
Congress delegated to the Commission broad authority to
determine when sentencing courts may reward substantial
assistance with a reduced sentence. See 28 U. S. C. $ 994(n).

136 MELENDEZ v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of Breyer, J.
The Commission's exercise of delegated authority is nor-mally lawful as long as it is reasonable. See, e. g., United

States v. Shabazz, 933 F. 2d 1029, 1035 (CADC) (Thomas, J.)(citing Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense
Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-845 (1984)), cert. denied sub
nom. McNeil v. United States, 502 U. S. 964 (1991). Anda unitary system seems perfectly reasonable. Indeed, the

Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure recognize an identical"unitary" system for postjudgment substantial assistance
motions. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 35(b) ("[O]n motion ofthe Government made within one year after the imposition
of the sentence," court may reduce sentence "to reflect adefendant's subsequent, substantial assistance"; this may include reduction "to a level below that established by statuteas a minimum sentence"). Thus in my view, the Commission
had the power to create a "unitary motion system," and isfree to maintain such a system, or to change it, in light of
evolving criminal justice policies.In this case, the lower courts accepted the Government's
"departure" motion as sufficient to justify a departure belowthe 135-month Guideline minimum applicable to petitioner's
crime, but not sufficient to justify a departure below the ap-plicable 10-year statutory minimum. On a "unitary" view,
this disposition could not be correct. Either the motion wassufficient to warrant a departure below the statutory minimum, or it was insufficient to warrant a departure below theGuideline minimum. I would remand this case to the lower
courts for further consideration of this case-specific issue.For these reasons, while agreeing with much of what the
Court has written, I dissent from its disposition.

137OCTOBER TERM, 1995
Per Curiam

LEAVITT, GOVERNOR OF UTAH, et al. v.JANE L.

et al.

on petition for writ of certiorari to the unitedstates court of appeals for the tenth circuit

No. 95-1242. Decided June 17, 1996
Utah law permits abortions under only five enumerated circumstances

with respect to pregnancies of 20 weeks or less, Utah Code Ann. $ 76-7-
302(2), and under only three of those circumstances with respect to
pregnancies of more than 20 weeks, $ 76-7-302(3). The law also provides that the legislature "would have passed [every aspect of the law]
irrespective of the fact that any one or more provision . . . be declared
unconstitutional." $ 76-7-317. The Federal District Court held $ 302
(2) unconstitutional, but found $ 302(3) to be both constitutional and severable. However, the Tenth Circuit concluded that $ 302(3) was not severable, reasoning that the Utah Legislature would not have wanted to
regulate later-term abortions unless it could regulate earlier-term ones.

Held: The Tenth Circuit's severability decision is flatly contradicted by

$ 76-7-317 and, thus, is unsustainable. Contrary to that court's conclusion, Utah law does not require the subordination of severability clauses
to the legislature's overarching substantive intentions. Utah cases support the proposition that, where a statute's provisions are interrelated,
a court may not select the Act's valid portions and conjecture that they
should stand independently of the invalid portions. However, such concerns are absent here. There is no need to resort to conjecture, for

$ 317 could not be clearer in its message that the legislature intended

$$ 302(2) and (3) to be severable. In addition, the two subsections are
not "interrelated" in any relevant sense--i. e., in the sense of being so
interdependent that the remainder of the statute cannot function effectively without the invalidated provision, or in the sense that the invalidated provision could be regarded as part of a legislative compromise,
extracted in exchange for the inclusion of other statutory provisions.

Certiorari granted; 61 F. 3d 1493, reversed and remanded.

Per Curiam.
The State of Utah seeks review of a ruling by the Courtof Appeals for the Tenth Circuit which declared invalid a

provision of Utah law regulating abortions "[a]fter 20 weeksgestational age." Utah Code Ann. $ 76-7-302(3) (1995).

Per Curiam
The court made that declaration, not on the ground that theprovision violates federal law, but rather on the ground that

the provision was not severable from another provision ofthe same statute, purporting to regulate abortions up to 20
weeks' gestational age, which had been struck down as un-constitutional. The court's severability ruling was based on
its view that the Utah Legislature would not have wantedto regulate the later-term abortions unless it could regulate
the earlier-term abortions as well. Whatever the validityof such speculation as a general matter, in the present case
it is flatly contradicted by a provision in the very part ofthe Utah Code at issue, explicitly stating that each statutory
provision was to be regarded as having been enacted inde-pendently of the others. Because we regard the Court of
Appeals' determination as to the Utah Legislature's intentto be irreconcilable with that body's own statement on the
subject, we grant the petition for certiorari as to this aspectof the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and summarily
reverse.Utah law, as amended by legislation enacted in 1991, establishes two regimes of regulation for abortion, based onthe term of the pregnancy. With respect to pregnancies 20
weeks old or less, $ 302(2) permits abortions only under fiveenumerated circumstances, Utah Code Ann. $ 76-7-302(2)
(1995). With respect to pregnancies of more than 20 weeks,$ 302(3) permits abortions under only three of the five
circumstances specified in $ 302(2). $ 76-7-302(3).1 In the

"(2) An abortion may be performed in this state only under the following circumstances:

"(a) in the professional judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician, the abortion is necessary to save the pregnant woman's life;

"(b) the pregnancy is the result of rape or rape of a child . . . that was
reported to a law enforcement agency prior to the abortion;

"(c) the pregnancy is the result of incest . . . and the incident was reported
to a law enforcement agency prior to the abortion;

present suit for declaratory and injunctive relief, the DistrictCourt for the District of Utah held $ 302(2) to be unconstitutional, but $ 302(3) to be both constitutional and severable--i. e., enforceable despite the invalidation of the other provision. Jane L. v. Bangerter, 809 F. Supp. 865, 870 (1992).Upon appeal by the plaintiffs with regard to the latter provision, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that itcould not be enforced, regardless of its constitutionality, because it was not severable from the invalidated portion ofthe law.

Jane L. v. Bangerter, 61 F. 3d 1493, 1499 (1995).The State argues that that conclusion is simply unsustainable in light of the Utah Legislature's express indication tothe contrary, and we agree.

Severability is of course a matter of state law. In Utah,as the Court of Appeals acknowledged, the matter "is determined first and foremost by answering the following ques-tion: Would the legislature have passed the statute without
the unconstitutional section?" Id., at 1497 (citing Stewartv.

Utah Public Service Comm'n, 885 P. 2d 759, 779 (Utah1994)). A provision of the abortion part of the Utah Code,

to which these two sections were added, answers that ques-tion. Section 317 provides:

"If any one or more provision, section, subsection, sen-tence, clause, phrase or word of this part or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is found tobe unconstitutional, the same is hereby declared to be

"(d) in the professional judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician, to prevent grave damage to the pregnant woman's medical health;
or

"(e) in the professional judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician, to prevent the birth of a child that would be born with grave
defects.

"(3) After 20 weeks gestational age, measured from the date of conception, an abortion may be performed only for those purposes and circumstances described in Subsections (2)(a), (d), and (e)." Utah Code Ann.

severable and the balance of this part shall remain effec-tive notwithstanding such unconstitutionality. The legislature hereby declares that it would have passed thispart, and each provision, section, subsection, sentence,
clause, phrase or word thereof, irrespective of the fact
that any one or more provision, section, subsection, sen-tence, clause, phrase, or word be declared unconstitutional." Utah Code Ann. $ 76-7-317 (1995) (emphasisadded).

In the face of this statement by the Utah Legislature ofits own intent in enacting regulations of abortion, the Court
of Appeals nonetheless concluded that $$ 302(2) and 302(3)were not severable because the Utah Legislature did not intend them to be so. The Court of Appeals' opinion not onlydid not regard the explicit language of $ 317 as determinative--it did not even use it as the point of departure for ad-dressing the severability question. It understood Utah law
as instructing courts to "subordinate severability clauses,which evince the legislature's intent regarding the

structureof the statute, to the legislature's overarching substantive

intentions." 61 F. 3d, at 1499 (emphasis added). The courtdivined in the 1991 amendments a "substantive intent" to
prohibit virtually all abortions, see id., at 1497-1498, andwent on to conclude that since, in its view, severing $ 302(2)
from $ 302(3) would frustrate this overarching purpose, bothprovisions had to stand or fall together, see

id., at 1499. Webelieve that the Court of Appeals erred at both steps of

this progression.The dichotomy between "structural" and "substantive" intents is nowhere to be found in the Utah cases cited as au-thority by the Court of Appeals. Indeed, none of those
cases even speaks in terms of "conflicts among legislativeintentions,"

id., at 1498. The cases do support the proposi-tion that, "even where a savings clause exist[s], where the

provisions of the statute are interrelated, it is not within thescope of th[e] court's function to select the valid portions of

the act and conjecture that they should stand independentlyof the portions which are invalid." State v. Salt Lake City,

445 P. 2d 691, 696 (Utah 1968). See also Salt Lake City v.International Assn. of Firefighters, 563 P. 2d 786, 791 (Utah
1977); Carter v. Beaver County Service Area No. One, 399P. 2d 440, 441 (Utah 1965). But those concerns are absent
from this case, for two reasons. First, because there is noneed to resort to "conjecture": The legislature's abortion
laws include not merely the standard "saving" clause, but aprovision that could not be clearer in its message that the
legislature "would have passed [every aspect of the law] irre-spective of the fact that any one or more provision . . . be
declared unconstitutional." $ 76-7-317.2 And second, be-cause the two sections at issue here are not "interrelated" in
any relevant sense--i. e., in the sense of being so interde-pendent that the remainder of the statute cannot function
effectively without the invalidated provision, or in the sensethat the invalidated provision could be regarded as part of a
legislative compromise, extracted in exchange for the inclu-sion of other provisions of the statute.

3 Nothing like that

appears here. The Court of Appeals described $ 302(3) as

2 In none of the Utah cases relied upon by the Court of Appeals was
there a legislative statement of this sort. In both Salt Lake City v. International Assn. of Firefighters, 563 P. 2d 786 (1977), and Carter v. Beaver
County Service Area No. One, 399 P. 2d 440 (1965), the saving clauses at
issue simply declared: "If any provision of this act, or the application of
any provision to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder
of this act shall not be affected thereby." See 1975 Utah Laws, ch. 102,

$ 10; 1961 Utah Laws, ch. 34, $ 3. And in State v. Salt Lake City, 445 P.
2d 691, 696 (1968), the court treated the saving clause in the municipal
ordinance under review as no different from the one discussed in Carter,
upon which the court relied.

3 Compare International Assn. of Firefighters, supra, at 791 ("The [invalidated] provisions . . . are an integral part of the act. . . . The concept
of binding arbitration is wholly interdependent with the other provisions
of the act"); Carter, supra, at 441-442 ("[T]he separability clause . . . is
ineffective, because of the dependency of the remaining sections upon the
provisions declared inoperative") (emphases added).

"modif[ying]" $ 302(2), and concluded that, "[w]ith the nullification of the abortion ban in section 302(2), the statute
was gutted, and section 302(3) was left purposeless without
an abortion ban to modify." 61 F. 3d, at 1498. But as examination of the provisions makes apparent, see n. 1, supra,

$ 302(3) cannot possibly be said to "modify" $ 302(2) in the
sense of being an adjunct to it, as an adjective "modifies" a
noun. Rather, it can be said to "modify" $ 302(2) only in the
sense of altering its disposition--permitting, for post-20-
week abortions, some but not all of the justifications allowed
(for earlier-term abortions) by $ 302(2). It is impossible to
see how this could lead to the conclusion that $ 302(3) is left
"purposeless" when $ 302(2) is declared inoperative. Of
course $ 302(3) does incorporate by reference permissible
justifications for abortion set forth in $ 302(2), instead of repeating them verbatim, but this drafting device can hardly
be thought to establish such "interdependence" that $ 302(3)
becomes "purposeless" when $ 302(2) is unenforceable. To
the contrary, $ 302(3) sets out in straightforward and selfoperative fashion the circumstances under which an abortion
may be performed "[a]fter 20 weeks gestational age."

But even if the Court of Appeals were correct in treating

$ 317 like an ordinary saving clause; even if it were right in
believing that there existed the "interrelationship" between

$$ 302(2) and 302(3) that would permit an ordinary saving
clause to be disregarded; and even if it had not invented the
notion of "structural-substantive" dichotomy; the reasoning
by which it concluded that the "substantive" intent of the
Utah Legislature was to forgo all regulation of abortion
unless it could obtain total regulation is flawed. The court
reasoned that, because the intent of the 1991 amendments
was "to prohibit all abortions, regardless of when they occur
during the pregnancy, except in the few specified circumstances," 61 F. 3d, at 1497, and because $$ 302(2) and 302(3)
"operated as a unified expression of [that] intent," ibid., for

the court to separate $ 302(2) from $ 302(3) based on the
unconstitutionality of the former would "clearly undermin[e]
the legislative purpose to ban most abortions," id., at 1498.4

This mode of analysis, if carried out in every case, would
operate to defeat every claim of severability. Every legislature that adopts, in a single enactment, provision A plus provision B intends (A+B); and that enactment, which reads
(A+B), is invariably a "unified expression of that intent," so
that taking away A from (A+B), leaving only B, will invariably "clearly undermine the legislative purpose" to enact
(A+B). But the fallacy in applying this reasoning to the severability question is that it is not the severing that will take
away A from (A+B) and thus foil the legislature's intent;
it is the invalidation of A (in this case, because of its unconstitutionality) which does so--an invalidation that occurs
whether or not the two provisions are severed. The relevant question, in other words, is not whether the legislature
would prefer (A+B) to B, because by reason of the invalidation of A that choice is no longer available. The relevant
question is whether the legislature would prefer not to have
B if it could not have A as well. Here, the Court of Appeals
in effect said yes. It determined that a legislature bent

4 The Court of Appeals also adverted to Utah Code Ann. $ 76-7-317.2
(1995), which it interpreted as "making an exception to the general severability clause specifically for section 302." Jane L. v. Bangerter, 61 F. 3d,
at 1499. Section 317.2 does nothing of the sort. It provides, simply, that
"[i]f Section 76-7-302 as amended by Senate Bill 23, 1991 Annual General
Session, is ever held to be unconstitutional by the United States Supreme
Court, Section 76-7-302, as enacted by Chapter 33, Laws of Utah 1974, is
reenacted and immediately effective." This provision does not speak to
severability, but to the consequence of invalidation, presumably total invalidation. (For if the invalidation of $ 302(2) alone triggered $ 317.2, then
all of $ 302 would be replaced by the pre-existing, 1974 version. But the
Court of Appeals did not decree $ 302(1) as inoperative, nor did respondents seek that result.) Respondents make no effort to defend the ruling
below on the basis of $ 317.2.

on banning almost all abortions would prefer, if it couldnot have that desire, to ban no abortions at all rather than

merely some. This notion is, at the very least, questionablewhen considered in isolation. But when it is put forward in
the face of a statutory text that explicitly states the opposite,
it is plainly error. * * *

We have summarily set aside unsupportable judgments in
cases involving only individual claims, see, e. g., Board of Ed.
of Rogers v. McCluskey, 458 U. S. 966, 969-971 (1982); National Bank of North America v. Associates of Obstetrics &
Female Surgery, Inc., 425 U. S. 460, 460-461 (1976). Muchmore is that appropriate when what is at issue is the total

invalidation of a statewide law, see, e. g., Idaho Dept. of
Employment v. Smith, 434 U. S. 100, 100-102 (1977). To be
sure, we do not normally grant petitions for certiorari solelyto review what purports to be an application of state law;

but we have done so, see Steele v. General Mills, Inc., 329
U. S. 433, 438, 440-441 (1947); Wichita Royalty Co. v. City
Nat. Bank of Wichita Falls, 306 U. S. 103, 107 (1939),5 andundoubtedly should do so where the alternative is allowing

5 The dissent says that our review in Wichita Royalty Co. "was plainly
motivated by a concern to give effect to [the] new mandate" of Erie R.
Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938), that federal courts apply state substantive law in diversity cases. Post, at 147. It remains the case, however, that "the only question for our decision" was whether the Court of
Appeals was correct in its interpretation of state law. 306 U. S., at 107
(emphasis added). As for Steele v. General Mills, Inc., 329 U. S. 433 (1947),
there our review was prompted by concern that the judgment below "undermine[d] the transportation policy of Texas," id., at 438. But unless we
were wrong in Steele to regard this as "a question of such importance" as
to justify review, ibid., the Tenth Circuit's "undermin[ing] [of] the [abortion] policy of [Utah]" presents an issue equally worth our attention. If
the dissent is correct that Steele was our last case of this sort, it indicates
only that we have not since been faced with a federal court's equivalently
clear misinterpretation of a state law of equivalent significance.

blatant federal-court nullification of state law. The dissent
argues that "[t]he doctrine of judicial restraint" weighs
against review, post, at 146, but it is an odd notion of judicial
restraint that would compel us to cast a blind eye on overreaching by lower federal courts. The fact observed by the
dissent, that the "underlying substantive issue in this
case" is a controversial one, generating "a kind of `hydraulic
pressure' that motivates ad hoc decisionmaking," ibid., provides a greater, not a lesser, justification for reversing
state-law determinations that seem plainly wrong. In our
view, these considerations combine to make this an "extraordinary cas[e]" worth our effort of summary review, post, at
147.

Finally, the dissent's appeal to the supposed greater expertise of courts of appeals regarding state law is particularly
weak (if not indeed counterindicative) where a Court of Appeals panel consisting of judges from Oklahoma, Colorado,
and Kansas has reversed the District Court of Utah on a
point of Utah law. If, as we have said, the courts of appeals
owe no deference to district court adjudications of state law,
see Salve Regina College v. Russell, 499 U. S. 225, 239-240
(1991), surely there is no basis for regarding panels of circuit
judges as "better qualified" than we to pass on such questions, see post, at 146. Our general presumption that courts
of appeals correctly decide questions of state law reflects a
judgment as to the utility of reviewing them in most cases,
see Salve Regina College, supra, at 235, n. 3, not a belief
that the courts of appeals have some natural advantage in
this domain, cf. Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S.
491, 500 (1985) ("[W]e surely have the authority to differ
with the lower federal courts as to the meaning of a state
statute"); Cole v. Richardson, 405 U. S. 676, 683-685 (1972).
That general presumption is obviously inapplicable where
the court of appeals' state-law ruling is plainly wrong, a conclusion that the dissent does not even contest in this case.

Stevens, J., dissenting
The opinion of the Tenth Circuit in this case is not sustain-able. Accordingly, we grant the petition as to the severability question, summarily reverse the judgment, and remandthe case to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings.

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

The severability issue discussed in the Court's per curiamopinion is purely a question of Utah law. It is contrary to

our settled practice to grant a petition for certiorari for thesole purpose of deciding a state-law question ruled upon by
a federal court of appeals. The justifications for that prac-tice are well established: The courts of appeals are more familiar with and thus better qualified than we to interpretthe laws of the States within their Circuits; the decision of a
federal court (even this Court) on a question of state law isnot binding on state tribunals; and a decision of a state-law
issue by a court of appeals, whether right or wrong, doesnot have the kind of national significance that is the typical
predicate for the exercise of our certiorari jurisdiction.*The underlying substantive issue in this case generates
what Justice Holmes once described as a kind of "hydraulicpressure" that motivates ad hoc decisionmaking. Northern
Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U. S. 197, 401 (1904) (dis-senting opinion). Even if the court of appeals has rendered
an incorrect decision, that is no reason for us to jettison thetraditional guides to our practice of certiorari review. The
doctrine of judicial restraint counsels the opposite course.

*The majority finds deference to the Court of Appeals "counterindicative" because it reversed the District Court for the District of Utah
on a point of Utah law. Ante, at 145. But courts of appeals owe district
courts no deference on state-law questions; they review such matters de
novo. See Salve Regina College v. Russell, 499 U. S. 225, 235-240 (1991)
(rejecting reliance on the "local expertise" of the District Court). The
geography of the Circuit, see ante, at 145, is utterly irrelevant.

Stevens, J., dissenting
The majority counters with a pair of cases that supposedly
show the absence of a settled practice regarding review of
state-law questions. One of those--Wichita Royalty Co. v.
City Nat. Bank of Wichita Falls, 306 U. S. 103 (1939)--was
a diversity case decided in the wake of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938). Just four weeks before we handed
down Erie, the Court of Appeals had disclaimed its obligation to follow a controlling decision by the Texas Supreme
Court (indeed, one rendered in an earlier stage of the same
proceedings) on a matter of Texas commercial law. 306
U. S., at 106. The Court of Appeals then denied rehearing
on the theory that the Texas court had changed its mind and
now agreed with the former's view of the law. Ibid. Our
decision to hear that case, which resulted in our rejection
of the lower court's conclusion, was plainly motivated by a
concern to give effect to Erie's new mandate.

That leaves the single example of Steele v. General Mills,
Inc., 329 U. S. 433 (1947), in which this Court granted certiorari because the lower court's judgment "undermine[d]
the transportation policy of Texas." Id., at 438. Decided
nearly 50 years ago and without successor, Steele is the
exception that proves the rule.

However irregular such grants were in the past, they are
now virtually unheard of. Indeed, in 1980 we codified our
already longstanding practice by eliminating as a consideration for deciding whether to review a case the fact that "a
court of appeals has . . . decided an important state or territorial question in a way in conflict with applicable state or
territorial law." Compare this Court's Rule 19(1)(b) (1970)
with this Court's Rule 17.1 (1980). That deletion--the only
deletion of an entire category of cases--was intended to communicate our view that errors in the application of state law
are not a sound reason for granting certiorari, except in the
most extraordinary cases. Tellingly, the majority does not
cite a single example during the past 16 years in which we

CALDERON, WARDEN v. MOORE
on petition for writ of certiorari to the unitedstates court of appeals for the ninth circuit

No. 95-1612. Decided June 17, 1996
Respondent Moore was convicted of first-degree murder in a California

state court and sentenced to death. The Federal District Court
granted habeas relief, thereby vacating the conviction and ordering petitioner warden to release Moore from custody after 60 days unless the
State granted him a new trial. The State filed an appeal, but after its
applications to stay the order were denied, it set Moore for retrial and
simultaneously pursued its appeal. The Ninth Circuit dismissed the
appeal as moot, observing that the State had granted Moore a new trial.

Held: The case is not moot. An appeal should be dismissed as moot when

a court of appeals cannot grant any effectual relief whatever in favor of
an appellant. Mills v. Green, 159 U. S. 651, 653. However, the availability of a partial remedy is sufficient to prevent mootness. Such a
remedy is available to the State because a decision in its favor would
release it from the burden of providing a new trial for Moore. Thus,
the Ninth Circuit is not prevented from granting any effectual relief.

Certiorari granted; reversed and remanded.

Per Curiam.
Respondent Charles Edward Moore, Jr., was convicted offirst-degree murder in a California state court, and sentenced to death. The District Court granted habeas relief,concluding that the state court had denied Moore his right
to self-representation under Faretta v. California, 422 U. S.806 (1975). The District Court thus vacated the judgment
of conviction and ordered the warden, petitioner here, to "re-lease Moore from custody after the expiration of 60 days unless, within 60 days hereof, the State of California grants
Moore the right to a new trial." App. A to Brief in Opposi-tion A65.

The State filed a notice of appeal and sought a stay of theDistrict Court's order pending appeal, but its various stay

applications were respectively denied by the District Court,
the Ninth Circuit, 56 F. 3d 39 (1995), and by Justice O'Connor, in her capacity as Circuit Justice for the Ninth Circuit.
The State accordingly set Moore for retrial, and simultaneously pursued its appeal of the District Court's order on the
merits to the Ninth Circuit. The Court of Appeals, observing that the "State of California has granted petitioner
Charles Edward Moore, Jr., a new trial," dismissed the
State's appeal as moot. App. A to Pet. for Cert.

It is true, of course, that mootness can arise at any stage
of litigation, Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U. S. 452, 459, n. 10
(1974); that federal courts may not "give opinions upon moot
questions or abstract propositions," Mills v. Green, 159 U. S.
651, 653 (1895); and that an appeal should therefore be dismissed as moot when, by virtue of an intervening event, a
court of appeals cannot grant "any effectual relief whatever"
in favor of the appellant, ibid. The available remedy, however, does not need to be "fully satisfactory" to avoid mootness. Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United States, 506
U. S. 9, 13 (1992). To the contrary, even the availability of a
"partial remedy" is "sufficient to prevent [a] case from being
moot." Ibid.

In this case, to say the least, a "partial remedy" necessary
to avoid mootness will be available to the State of California
(represented here by petitioner). While the administrative
machinery necessary for a new trial has been set in motion,
that trial has not yet even begun, let alone reached a point
where the court could no longer award any relief in the
State's favor. Because a decision in the State's favor would
release it from the burden of the new trial itself, the Court
of Appeals is not prevented from granting "any effectual relief whatever" in the State's favor, Mills, supra, at 653, and
the case is clearly not moot. We therefore grant respondent's motion to proceed in forma pauperis, grant petition
for a writ of certiorari, reverse the judgment of the Court

GRAY v. NETHERLAND, WARDEN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 95-6510. Argued April 15, 1996--Decided June 20, 1996
At the start of petitioner's Virginia trial for the capital murder of Richard

McClelland, the prosecution acknowledged that, should the trial reach
the penalty phase, it would introduce petitioner's admissions to other
inmates that he had previously murdered Lisa Sorrell and her daughter.
The day that petitioner was convicted of the McClelland murder, the
prosecution disclosed that it would introduce additional evidence at sentencing linking petitioner to the Sorrell murders, including crime scene
photographs and testimony from the Sorrell investigating detective and
medical examiner. Counsel moved to exclude evidence pertaining to
any felony for which petitioner had not been charged. Although counsel also complained that he was not prepared for the additional evidence,
and that the defense was taken by surprise, he did not request a continuance. The court denied the motions to exclude, and, after a hearing,
petitioner was sentenced to death. After exhausting his state remedies, he sought federal habeas relief, claiming, as relevant here, that
inadequate notice prevented him from defending against the evidence
introduced at the penalty phase, and that the Commonwealth failed to
disclose exculpatory evidence regarding the Sorrell murders. The District Court initially denied relief, finding that petitioner had no constitutional right to notice of individual testimony that the Commonwealth
planned to introduce at sentencing, and that the claim made under
Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, was procedurally barred under Virginia law. However, the court later amended its judgment, concluding
that petitioner was denied due process when the Commonwealth failed
to provide fair notice of what Sorrell murder evidence would be introduced. In reversing, the Fourth Circuit found that granting habeas relief would give petitioner the benefit of a new rule of federal constitutional law, in violation of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288. The grant of
certiorari is limited to petitioner's notice-of-evidence and Brady claims.

Held:

1. Petitioner's Brady claim is procedurally defaulted. He never
raised that claim in state court, and, because he knew of its grounds
when he filed his first state petition, Virginia law precludes review of
the defaulted claim in any future state habeas proceeding. This provides an independent and adequate state-law ground for the conviction

153Cite as: 518 U. S. 152 (1996)
Syllabus
and sentence, and thus prevents federal habeas review of the defaulted
claim, unless petitioner can demonstrate cause and prejudice for the
default. Teague v. Lane, supra, at 298. Because he has made no such
demonstration, his claim is not cognizable in a federal suit for the writ.
Pp. 161-162.

2. The misrepresentation claim raised by petitioner in his brief here
is remanded for the Court of Appeals to determine whether he in fact
raised that issue below. Pp. 162-166.

(a) In his brief, petitioner relies on two separate due process challenges to the manner in which the prosecution introduced evidence
about the Sorrell murders: a notice-of-evidence claim alleging that the
Commonwealth failed to give adequate notice of the evidence it would
use, and a misrepresentation claim alleging that the Commonwealth
misled him about the evidence it intended to present. For purposes
of exhausting state remedies, a habeas claim must include reference to
a specific federal constitutional guarantee, as well as a statement of the
facts entitling a petitioner to relief. Picard v. Connor, 404 U. S. 270.
A petitioner does not satisfy the exhaustion requirement by presenting
the state courts only with the facts necessary to state a claim for relief.
Nor is it enough to make a general appeal to a constitutional guarantee
as broad as due process to present the "substance" of such a claim to
a state court. Anderson v. Harless, 459 U. S. 4. Gardner v. Florida,
430 U. S. 349--on which petitioner relies for his notice-of-evidence
claim--and In re Ruffalo, 390 U. S. 544, Raley v. Ohio, 360 U. S. 423,
and Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U. S. 103--on which he relies for his misrepresentation claim--arise in widely differing contexts. The two
claims are separate. Pp. 162-165.

(b) If petitioner never raised the misrepresentation issue in state
proceedings, federal habeas review would be barred unless he could
demonstrate cause and prejudice for his failure to raise the claim in
state proceedings. However, if it was addressed in the federal proceedings, the Commonwealth would have been obligated to raise procedural
default as a defense or lose the right to assert the defense thereafter.
If the Court of Appeals determines that the issue was raised, it should
consider whether the Commonwealth has preserved any defenses and
proceed to consider the claim and preserved defenses as appropriate.
Pp. 165-166.

3. Petitioner's notice-of-evidence claim would require the adoption of
a new constitutional rule. Pp. 166-170.

(a) Petitioner contends that he was deprived of adequate notice
when he received only one day's notice of the additional evidence, but,
rather than seeking a continuance, he sought to have all such evidence
excluded. For him to prevail, he must establish that due process re518US1$75Z 05-18-99 20:35:34 PAGES OPINPGT
154 GRAY v. NETHERLAND

Syllabus
quires that he receive more than a day's notice of the Commonwealth's
evidence. He must also show that due process required a continuance
whether or not he sought one, or that, if he chose not to seek a continuance, exclusion was the only appropriate remedy. Only the adoption of
a new constitutional rule could establish these propositions. A defendant has the right to notice of the charges against which he must defend.
In re Ruffalo, supra. However, he does not have a constitutional right
to notice of the evidence which the state plans to use to prove the
charges, and Brady, which addressed only exculpatory evidence, did
not create one. Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U. S. 545, 559. Gardner v.
Florida, supra, distinguished. Even if notice were required, exclusion
of evidence is not the sole remedy for a violation of such a right, since
a continuance could minimize prejudice. Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U. S.
400, 413. Petitioner made no such request here, and in view of his insistence on exclusion, the trial court might well have felt that it would
have been interfering with counsel's tactical decision to order a continuance on its own motion. Pp. 166-170.

(b) The new rule petitioner proposes does not fall within Teague's
second exception, which is for watershed rules of criminal procedure
implicating a criminal proceeding's fundamental fairness and accuracy.
Whatever one may think of the importance of petitioner's proposed rule,
it has none of the primacy and centrality of the rule adopted in Gideon
v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, or other rules which may be thought to be
within the exception. Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S. 484, 495. P. 170.

Opinion of the Court
Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

Petitioner, convicted of capital murder, complains that hisright to due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment was violated because he was not given adequate noticeof some of the evidence the Commonwealth intended to use
against him at the penalty hearing of his trial. We hold thatthis claim would necessitate a "new rule," and that therefore
it does not provide a basis on which he may seek federal
habeas relief. I

A
Richard McClelland was the manager of a departmentstore, Murphy's Mart, in Portsmouth, Virginia. On May 2,

1985, at approximately 9:30 p.m., petitioner and Melvin
Tucker, a friend, both under the influence of cocaine, parked
in the parking lot of the Murphy's Mart and watched McClelland and a store security guard inside. Shortly before midnight, McClelland and the guard came out of the store and
left in separate automobiles. With Tucker in the passenger
seat, petitioner followed McClelland, pulled in front of his
car at a stop sign, threatened him with a .32-caliber revolver,
ordered him into petitioner's car, and struck him. Petitioner and Tucker took McClelland's wallet and threatened
to harm his family if he did not cooperate. Gray v. Commonwealth, 233 Va. 313, 340-341, 356 S. E. 2d 157, 172, cert.
denied, 484 U. S. 873 (1987).

Petitioner drove the car back to the Murphy's Mart, where
he forced McClelland at gunpoint to reopen the store. They
filled three gym bags with money, totaling between $12,000
and $13,000. Petitioner drove McClelland and Tucker to a
service station, bought gasoline for his car and for a gas can
in the car's trunk, and proceeded to a remote side road. He
took McClelland 15 to 20 feet behind the car and ordered him
to lie down. While McClelland begged petitioner not to

156 GRAY v. NETHERLAND

Opinion of the Court
hurt or shoot him, petitioner assured him he would not beharmed. Having thus assured McClelland, petitioner fired

six pistol shots into the back of his head in rapid succession.233 Va., at 341-342, 356 S. E. 2d, at 172-173.

Leaving McClelland's dead body on the side road, peti-tioner and Tucker returned to the intersection where they
had seized him. Petitioner, telling Tucker he wanted to de-stroy McClelland's car as evidence, doused its interior with
gasoline and lit it with a match. Id., at 341-342, 356 S. E.2d, at 173.

Petitioner and Tucker were later arrested and indicted inthe Circuit Court of the city of Suffolk on several counts,
including capital murder. Having evidence that petitionerhad announced before the killing that "he was going to get"
McClelland for having fired his wife from her job as a sales-woman at the Murphy's Mart, and that petitioner had told
other witnesses after the killing that he had performed it,the prosecutor entered into a plea bargain with Tucker. In
return for being tried for first-degree murder instead of capi-tal murder, Tucker would testify at petitioner's trial about
events leading up to the killing and would identify petitioneras the actual "trigger man."

Id., at 331, 356 S. E. 2d, at 167.

B
On Monday, December 2, 1985, petitioner's trial began.Petitioner's counsel moved that the trial court order the

prosecution to disclose the evidence it planned to introducein the penalty phase. The prosecutor acknowledged that "in
the event [petitioner] is found guilty we do intend to intro-duce evidence of statements he has made to other people
about other crimes he has committed of which he has notbeen convicted." 14 Record 8. In particular, the prosecution intended to show that petitioner had admitted to a noto-rious double murder in Chesapeake, a city adjacent to Suffolk. Lisa Sorrell and her 3-year-old daughter, Shanta, hadbeen murdered five months before McClelland was killed.

157Cite as: 518 U. S. 152 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
The prosecutor told petitioner's counsel in court that the onlyevidence he would introduce would be statements by petitioner to Tucker or fellow inmates that he committed thesemurders.

Id., at 11.
On Thursday, December 5, 1985, the jury convicted petitioner on all counts. That evening, the prosecution in-formed petitioner's counsel that the Commonwealth would

introduce evidence, beyond petitioner's own admissions,linking petitioner to the Sorrell murders. The additional
evidence included photographs of the crime scene and testi-mony by the police detective who investigated the murders
and by the state medical examiner who performed autopsies
on the Sorrells' bodies. The testimony was meant to show
that the manner in which Lisa and Shanta Sorrell had been
killed resembled the manner in which McClelland was killed.
The next morning, petitioner's counsel made two motions
"to have excluded from evidence during [the] penalty trial
any evidence pertaining to any . . . felony for which the
defendant has not yet been charged." 18 id., at 776. Counsel argued that the additional evidence exceeded the scope
of unadjudicated-crime evidence admissible for sentencing
under Virginia law, because "[i]n essence, what [the prosecutor is] doing is trying [the Sorrell] case in the minds of the
jurors." Id., at 724 (citing Watkins v. Commonwealth, 229
Va. 469, 331 S. E. 2d 422 (1985), cert. denied, 475 U. S. 1099
(1986)). Although counsel also complained that he was not
"prepared for any of this [additional evidence], other than
[that petitioner] may have made some incriminating statements," 18 Record 725, and that the "[d]efense was taken by
surprise," id., at 777, he never requested a continuance.
The trial court denied the motions to exclude.

During the sentencing phase, Tucker testified that, shortly
after the McClelland murder, petitioner pointed to a picture
of Lisa Sorrell in a newspaper and told Tucker that he had
"knocked off " Sorrell. Petitioner's counsel did not crossexamine Tucker. Officer Michael Slezak, who had investi518US1$75H 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT
158 GRAY v. NETHERLAND

Opinion of the Court
gated the Sorrell murders, testified that he found Lisa's bodyin the front seat of a partially burned automobile and Shanta's body in the trunk. Dr. Faruk Presswalla, the medicalexaminer who had performed autopsies on the bodies, testified that Lisa was killed by six bullets to the head, shot froma .32-caliber gun.

Gray, supra, at 345, 356 S. E. 2d, at 175.Petitioner's counsel did not cross-examine Dr. Presswalla,

and only cross-examined Officer Slezak to suggest thatMcClelland's murder may have been a "copycat" murder,
committed by a different perpetrator. 18 Record 793, 802.1The jury fixed petitioner's sentence for McClelland's
murder at death. The trial court entered judgment on theverdicts for all the charges against petitioner and sentenced
him to death. The Virginia Supreme Court affirmed, 233Va. 313, 356 S. E. 2d 157, and we denied certiorari, Gray v.
Virginia, 484 U. S. 873 (1987). The Suffolk Circuit Courtdismissed petitioner's state petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The Virginia Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal,
and we denied certiorari. Gray v. Thompson, 500 U. S. 949(1991).

C
Petitioner then sought a writ of habeas corpus from the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Vir-ginia. With respect to the Sorrell murders, he argued,

inter
alia, that he had "never been convicted of any of thesecrimes nor was he awaiting trial for these crimes," that the

Commonwealth "did not disclose its intentions to use the

1 The prosecutor introduced this testimony as evidence of petitioner's
future dangerousness. The prosecutor also introduced into evidence petitioner's criminal record, which included 13 felony convictions, at least 9 of
which were for crimes of violence, including armed robbery and malicious
wounding. Petitioner's record revealed that he had locked a restaurant's
employees in a food freezer while robbing the restaurant, and threatened
the lives of two persons other than McClelland. Gray v. Commonwealth,
233 Va. 313, 353, 356 S. E. 2d 157, 179, cert. denied, 484 U. S. 873 (1987).

Sorrell murders as evidence against [him] until such a latedate that it was impossible for [his] defense counsel reasonably to prepare or defend against such evidence at trial,"and that Tucker " `sold' his testimony to the Commonwealth
for . . . less than a life sentence." 1 Joint Appendix in
No. 94-4009 (CA4), pp. 32-33 (hereinafter J. A.).

The Commonwealth moved to dismiss the petition. To
clarify its arguments against petitioner's Sorrell murder
claim, it characterized petitioner's allegations as seven separate subclaims. The first subclaim asserted that petitioner
was given "inadequate notice of the evidence which the Commonwealth intended to introduce to permit him to defend
against it," and the third, relying on Brady v. Maryland, 373
U. S. 83 (1963), asserted that "[t]he Commonwealth failed to
disclose evidence tending to prove that someone else had
committed the Sorrell murders." 2 Respondent's Brief in
Support of Motion to Dismiss in No. 3:91CV693 (ED Va.),
p. 2. According to the Commonwealth, the notice-ofevidence subclaim was meritless and could not be the basis
for relief in federal habeas corpus proceedings because it
sought the retroactive application of a new rule of constitutional law. Id., at 18-19, 19-20. The Commonwealth
alleged that the Brady subclaim had not been presented to
the state courts on direct appeal or in state habeas corpus
proceedings, and was thus procedurally barred under Va.
Code Ann. $ 8.01-654(B)(2) (1992). Respondent's Brief in
Support of Motion to Dismiss, supra, at 19.

Initially, the District Court dismissed the habeas petition.
The court adopted the Commonwealth's characterization of
petitioner's Sorrell claim. See 1 J. A. 193. The court held
that petitioner was not entitled to relief on the notice-ofevidence subclaim, because he "has no constitutional right
to notice of individual items of testimony which the Com2 The other five subclaims are not relevant to our review.

Opinion of the Court
monwealth intends to introduce at the penalty phase." Id.,at 194. The court declined to review the

Brady subclaim
because it was procedurally barred. 1 J. A. 194.Later, on petitioner's motion, the District Court amended

its judgment to find within petitioner's Sorrell claim a specific due process claim about the admissibility of the Sorrellmurder evidence.

Id., at 252. (In amending this judgment,
the court announced that it remained unchanged as to theremaining claims, which it had dismissed.

Id., at 251.)
After holding an evidentiary hearing on the Sorrell claim,the District Court ordered that petitioner be granted a writ

of habeas corpus. The court characterized the claim as an
allegation that petitioner "was denied due process of law
under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution because the Commonwealth failed to provide fair
notice that evidence concerning the Sorrell murders would
be introduced at his penalty phase." App. 348. Citing
Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349, 357-359 (1977), the court
determined that there was a constitutional defect in petitioner's penalty phase hearing: "Petitioner was confronted and
surprised by the testimony of officer Slezak and Dr. Presswalla." App. 349. This defect "violated [petitioner's] right
to fair notice and rendered the hearing clearly unreliable,"
because petitioner's attorneys had less than one day's notice
of the additional evidence to be used against their client.
Id., at 349-350.

The Commonwealth appealed, arguing to the Fourth Circuit that to grant petitioner habeas relief would give him the
benefit of a new rule of federal constitutional law, in violation
of Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989). The Fourth Circuit
reversed the judgment granting the writ, rejected petitioner's cross-appeals from the dismissal of several other claims,
and remanded with directions that the habeas corpus petition be dismissed. Gray v. Thompson, 58 F. 3d 59, 67 (1995).
The court distinguished Gardner, on which the District
Court had relied, because petitioner, unlike Gardner, "was

161Cite as: 518 U. S. 152 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
not sentenced on the basis of any secret information." 58F. 3d, at 64. The court thus concluded that petitioner's

notice-of-evidence claim "was not compelled by existing prec-edent at the time his conviction became final," and thus could
not be considered in federal habeas proceedings under
Teague. 58 F. 3d, at 64.The Commonwealth scheduled petitioner's execution for

December 14, 1995. Petitioner applied for a stay of execu-tion and petitioned for a writ of certiorari from this Court.
We granted his stay application on December 13, 1995. 516U. S. 1034. On January 5, 1996, we granted certiorari, limited to the questions whether petitioner's notice-of-evidenceclaim stated a new rule and whether the Commonwealth
violated petitioner's due process rights under Brady bywithholding evidence exculpating him from responsibility
for the Sorrell murders. 516 U. S. 1037; see Pet. for Cert. i.

II
We first address petitioner's Brady claim. The DistrictCourt determined that "[t]his claim was not presented to the

Supreme Court of Virginia on direct appeal nor in state ha-beas corpus proceedings," and that "the factual basis of the
claim was available to [petitioner] at the time he litigated hisstate habeas corpus petition," and dismissed the claim on
this basis. 1 J. A. 194. Petitioner does not contest thesedeterminations in this Court.

Petitioner's failure to raise his Brady claim in state courtimplicates the requirements in habeas of exhaustion and procedural default. Title 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b) bars the grantingof habeas corpus relief "unless it appears that the applicant
has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of theState." Because "[t]his requirement . . . refers only to remedies still available at the time of the federal petition," Englev. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 126, n. 28 (1982), it is satisfied "if it is
clear that [the habeas petitioner's] claims are now procedur-ally barred under [state] law," Castille v. Peoples, 489 U. S.

162 GRAY v. NETHERLAND

Opinion of the Court
346, 351 (1989). However, the procedural bar that givesrise to exhaustion provides an independent and adequate

state-law ground for the conviction and sentence, and thusprevents federal habeas corpus review of the defaulted claim,
unless the petitioner can demonstrate cause and prejudicefor the default.

Brady claimwhen he filed his first petition, $ 8.01-654(B)(2) precludes review of petitioner's claim in any future state habeas proceed-ing. Because petitioner makes no attempt to demonstrate
cause or prejudice for his default in state habeas proceed-ings, his claim is not cognizable in a federal suit for the writ.

A

Petitioner makes a separate due process challenge to themanner in which the prosecution introduced evidence about

the Sorrell murders. We perceive two separate claims inthis challenge. As we will explain in greater detail below,
petitioner raises a "notice-of-evidence" claim, which allegesthat the Commonwealth deprived petitioner of due process
by failing to give him adequate notice of the evidence theCommonwealth would introduce in the sentencing phase of
his trial. He raises a separate "misrepresentation" claim,which alleges that the Commonwealth violated due process
by misleading petitioner about the evidence it intended touse at sentencing.

In Picard v. Connor, 404 U. S. 270 (1971), we held that,for purposes of exhausting state remedies, a claim for relief
in habeas corpus must include reference to a specific federal

518US1$75H 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT

163Cite as: 518 U. S. 152 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
constitutional guarantee, as well as a statement of the factsthat entitle the petitioner to relief. We considered whether

a habeas petitioner was entitled to relief on the basis of aclaim, which was not raised in the state courts or in his federal habeas petition, that the indictment procedure by which
he was brought to trial violated equal protection. Id., at271. In announcing that "the substance of a federal habeas

corpus claim must first be presented to the state courts," id.,at 278, we rejected the contention that the petitioner satisfied the exhaustion requirement of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b) bypresenting the state courts only with the facts necessary to
state a claim for relief. "The [state court] dealt with the
arguments [the habeas petitioner] offered; we cannot fault
that court for failing also to consider sua sponte whether the
indictment procedure denied [the petitioner] equal protection
of the laws." Id., at 277.

We have also indicated that it is not enough to make a
general appeal to a constitutional guarantee as broad as
due process to present the "substance" of such a claim to a
state court. In Anderson v. Harless, 459 U. S. 4 (1982), the
habeas petitioner was granted relief on the ground that it
violated due process for a jury instruction to obviate the
requirement that the prosecutor prove all the elements of
the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., at 7 (citing Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510 (1979)). The only manner
in which the habeas petitioner had cited federal authority
was by referring to a state-court decision in which "the defendant . . . asserted a broad federal due process right to jury
instructions that properly explain state law." 459 U. S., at
7 (internal quotation marks omitted). Our review of the
record satisfied us that the Sandstrom claim "was never presented to, or considered by, the [state] courts," but we found
it especially significant that the "broad federal due process
right" that the habeas petition might have been read to
incorporate did not include "the more particular analysis
developed in cases such as Sandstrom." 459 U. S., at 7.

164 GRAY v. NETHERLAND

Opinion of the Court
The due process challenge in petitioner's brief relies ontwo "particular analys[es]" of due process.

Ibid. Relying
on cases like Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349 (1977), and
Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1 (1986), petitioner argues that he should have been given " `such notice of the
issues involved in the [sentencing] hearing as [would have]reasonably enable[d] him to prepare his case,' " Brief for

Petitioner 32 (quoting B. Schwartz, Administrative Law 283(2d ed. 1984)), and that he was denied "a fair opportunity
to be heard on determinative sentencing issues," Brief forPetitioner 33. This right stems from the defendant's "legitimate interest in the character of the procedure which leads
to the imposition of sentence" of death, Gardner, 430 U. S.,
at 358, which justifies giving him an "opportunity to deny"
potentially determinative sentencing information, id., at 362.

"Yet another way in which the state may unconstitutionally . . . deprive [a defendant] of a meaningful opportunity to
address the issues, is simply by misinforming him." Brief
for Petitioner 34. Petitioner cites In re Ruffalo, 390 U. S.
544 (1968), Raley v. Ohio, 360 U. S. 423 (1959), and Mooney
v. Holohan, 294 U. S. 103 (1935), for this proposition. Ruffalo was a disbarment proceeding in which this Court held
that the disbarred attorney had not been given notice of the
charges against him by the Ohio committee which administered bar discipline. 390 U. S., at 550. In Raley, the chairman and members of a state investigating commission assured witnesses that the privilege against self-incrimination
was available to them, but when the witnesses were convicted for contempt the Supreme Court of Ohio held that a
state immunity statute rendered the Fifth Amendment privilege unavailable. 360 U. S., at 430-434. And in Mooney v.
Holohan, the defendant alleged that the prosecution knowingly used perjured testimony at his trial. 294 U. S., at 110.

Gardner, Ruffalo, Raley, and Mooney arise in widely differing contexts. Gardner forbids the use of secret testimony in the penalty proceeding of a capital case which the

165Cite as: 518 U. S. 152 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
defendant has had no opportunity to consider or rebut. Ruf-falo deals with a defendant's right to notice of the charges

against him. Whether or not Ruffalo might have supportedpetitioner's notice-of-evidence claim, see infra, at 169-170,
it does not support the misrepresentation claim for whichpetitioner cites it.

Mooney forbade the prosecution to en-gage in "a deliberate deception of court and jury." 294 U. S.,

at 112. Raley, though involving no deliberate deception,held that defendants who detrimentally relied on the assurance of a committee chairman could not be punished forhaving done so. Mooney, of course, would lend support to
petitioner's claim if it could be shown that the prosecutordeliberately misled him, not just that he changed his mind
over the course of the trial. The two claims are separate.

B
The Commonwealth argues that the misrepresentationclaim "was never argued before in any court." Brief for

Respondent 39. If petitioner never presented this claimon direct appeal or in state habeas proceedings, federal
habeas review of the claim would be barred unless petitionercould demonstrate cause and prejudice for his failure to raise
the claim in state proceedings. Supra, at 161-162. If theclaim was not raised or addressed in federal proceedings,
below, our usual practice would be to decline to review it.
Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 533 (1992).There is some ambiguity as to whether the misrepresentation claim was raised or addressed in the District Court orthe Court of Appeals. On the one hand, the District Court
ordered relief primarily on the basis of Gardner, i. e., lack ofnotice.

Supra, at 160. On the other hand, some of the Dis-trict Court findings advert to a deliberate decision by the

prosecutor to mislead petitioner's counsel for tactical advan-tage. See, e. g., App. 348, 350. The ambiguity in the federal
record complicates the state-court procedural default issue,because procedural default is an affirmative defense for the

518US1$75H 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT
166 GRAY v. NETHERLAND

Opinion of the Court
Commonwealth. If the misrepresentation claim was ad-dressed at some stage of federal proceedings, the Commonwealth would have been obligated to raise procedural defaultas a defense, or lose the right to assert the defense thereafter. See Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U. S. 231, 234, n. 1 (1980);see also

Schiro v. Farley, 510 U. S. 222, 227-228 (1994).We remand for the Court of Appeals to determine whether

petitioner in fact raised what in his briefs on the merits tothis Court he asserts has been his "fundamental complaint
throughout this litigation . . . : the Commonwealth's affirm-ative misrepresentation regarding its presentation of the
Sorrell murders . . . deprived Petitioner of a fair sentencingproceeding." Reply Brief for Petitioner 4-5. If the misrepresentation claim was raised, the Court of Appeals shouldconsider whether the Commonwealth has preserved any defenses to it and proceed to consider the claim and preserveddefenses as appropriate.

C
We turn to the notice-of-evidence claim, and considerwhether the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that this

claim sought the retroactive application of a new rule of fed-eral constitutional law. We have concluded that the writ's
purpose may be fulfilled with the least intrusion necessaryon States' interest of the finality of criminal proceedings by
applying constitutional standards contemporaneous with thehabeas petitioner's conviction to review his petition. See
Teague, 489 U. S., at 309-310 (opinion of O'Connor, J.).Thus, habeas relief is appropriate only if "a state court
considering [the petitioner's] claim at the time his convictionbecame final would have felt compelled by existing precedent to conclude that the rule [he] seeks was required by theConstitution." Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S. 484, 488 (1990).

At the latest, petitioner knew at the start of trial thatthe prosecutor intended to introduce evidence tending to
show that he committed the Sorrell murders. He knew thenthat the Commonwealth would call Tucker to the stand to

518US1$75H 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT

167Cite as: 518 U. S. 152 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
repeat his statement that petitioner had admitted to commit-ting the murders.

3 See App. 340; 14 Record 8-9. He nonetheless contends that he was deprived of adequate noticeof the

other witnesses, the police officer and the medical examiner who had investigated the Sorrell murders, whom he
was advised that the prosecutor would call only on the eve-ning before the sentencing hearing. App. 342; 18 Record

777. But petitioner did not attempt to cure this inadequacyof notice by requesting more time to respond to this evidence. He instead moved "to have excluded from evidenceduring this penalty trial any evidence pertaining to any
other--any felony for which the defendant has not yet beencharged."

4 Id., at 776.

On these facts, for petitioner to prevail on his notice-of-evidence claim, he must establish that due process requires

that he receive more than a day's notice of the Common-wealth's evidence. He must also establish that due process
required a continuance whether or not he sought one, or that,
if he chose not to seek a continuance, exclusion was the only
appropriate remedy for the inadequate notice. We conclude
that only the adoption of a new constitutional rule could
establish these propositions.

A defendant's right to notice of the charges against which
he must defend is well established. In re Ruffalo, 390 U. S.

3 When petitioner did object later, at the start of the penalty phase, to
the admission of all the Sorrell murder evidence, counsel conceded that he
would have been prepared to refute such evidence if it had consisted only
of testimony by Tucker or petitioner's fellow inmates that petitioner had
admitted to killing the Sorrells. See 18 Record 722, 780.

4 The District Court described petitioner's counsel as having made a

"plea for additional time to prepare." App. 343. The Court of Appeals
found this plea insufficient to have legal effect in court: "If the defense felt
unprepared to undertake effective cross-examination, one would think a
formal motion for continuance would have been forthcoming, but none was
ever made; counsel moved only that the evidence be excluded." Gray
v. Thompson, 58 F. 3d 59, 64 (CA4 1995). We agree with the Court of
Appeals.

168 GRAY v. NETHERLAND

Opinion of the Court
544 (1968); Cole v. Arkansas, 333 U. S. 196 (1948). But a
defendant's claim that he has a right to notice of the evidence
that the state plans to use to prove the charges stands on
quite a different footing. We have said that "the Due Process Clause has little to say regarding the amount of discovery
which the parties must be afforded." Wardius v. Oregon,
412 U. S. 470, 474 (1973). In Weatherford v. Bursey, 429
U. S. 545 (1977), we considered the due process claim of a
defendant who had been convicted with the aid of surprise
testimony of an accomplice who was an undercover agent.
Although the prosecutor had not intended to introduce the
agent's testimony, he changed his mind the day of trial. Id.,
at 549. To keep his cover, the agent had told the defendant
and his counsel that he would not testify against the defendant. Id., at 560. We rejected the defendant's claim, explaining that "[t]here is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case, and Brady," which addressed only
exculpatory evidence, "did not create one," id., at 559. To
put it mildly, these cases do not compel a court to order the
prosecutor to disclose his evidence; their import, in fact, is
strongly against the validity of petitioner's claim.

Petitioner relies principally on Gardner v. Florida, 430
U. S. 349 (1977), for the proposition that a defendant may not
be sentenced to death "on the basis of information which he
had no opportunity to deny or explain." Id., at 362 (opinion
of Stevens, J.). In Gardner, the trial court sentenced the
defendant to death relying in part on evidence assembled in
a presentence investigation by the state parole commission;
the "investigation report contained a confidential portion
which was not disclosed to defense counsel." Id., at 353.
Gardner literally had no opportunity to even see the confidential information, let alone contest it. Petitioner in the
present case, on the other hand, had the opportunity to hear
the testimony of Officer Slezak and Dr. Presswalla in open
court, and to cross-examine them. His claim to notice is

169Cite as: 518 U. S. 152 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
much more akin to the one rejected in Weatherford, supra,than to the one upheld in

Gardner.
Even were our cases otherwise on the notice issue, wehave acknowledged that exclusion of evidence is not the sole

remedy for a violation of a conceded right to notice of an
alibi witness. In Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U. S. 400 (1988), wesaid that in this situation "a less drastic sanction is always

available. Prejudice . . . could be minimized by granting acontinuance."

Id., at 413. Here, counsel did not request a
continuance; he argued only for exclusion. Counsel arguedthat the evidence should be excluded not only because he

was not prepared to contest the evidence, but also because
it exceeded the standard in Virginia, Watkins v. Commonwealth, 229 Va. 469, 331 S. E. 2d 422 (1985), for relevance of
unsolved-crime evidence to sentencing. See 18 Record 723.
In view of petitioner's insistence on exclusion of the evidence, the trial court might well have felt that it would have
been interfering with a tactical decision of counsel to order
a continuance on its own motion.

The dissent argues that petitioner seeks the benefit of
a well-established rule, that "a capital defendant must be
afforded a meaningful opportunity to explain or deny the
evidence introduced against him at sentencing." Post, at
180. Because we disagree with the dissent's assertion that
petitioner moved for a continuance, we disagree with its
characterization of the constitutional rule underlying his
claim for relief. Compare supra, at 166-167, and n. 4, with
post, at 184-185, n. 11. The dissent glosses over the similarities between this case and Weatherford, which " `dictate[s],' " post, at 180, the disposition of petitioner's claim--
adversely to petitioner--more clearly than any precedent
cited by the dissent. But even without Weatherford and
petitioner's failure to move for a continuance, we would still
think the new-rule doctrine "would be meaningless if applied
at this level of generality." Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227,
236 (1990). We therefore hold that petitioner's notice-of518US1$75H 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT
170 GRAY v. NETHERLAND

Opinion of the Court
evidence claim would require the adoption of a new constitutional rule.

D

Petitioner argues that relief should be granted nonetheless, because the new rule he proposes falls within one of
Teague's two exceptions. "The first exception permits the
retroactive application of a new rule if the rule places a class
of private conduct beyond the power of the State to proscribe." Parks, 494 U. S., at 494 (citing Teague, 489 U. S.,
at 311). This exception is not at issue here. "The second
exception is for `watershed rules of criminal procedure' implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding." Parks, supra, at 495 (citing Teague, supra,
at 311; Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 416 (1990)). Petitioner argues that his notice-of-evidence new rule is "mandated by long-recognized principles of fundamental fairness
critical to accuracy in capital sentencing determinations."
Brief for Petitioner 47.

We observed in Saffle v. Parks that the paradigmatic example of a watershed rule of criminal procedure is the requirement that counsel be provided in all criminal trials for
serious offenses. 494 U. S., at 495 (citing Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963)). "Whatever one may think of
the importance of [petitioner's] proposed rule, it has none of
the primacy and centrality of the rule adopted in Gideon or
other rules which may be thought to be within the exception." Parks, supra, at 495. The rule in Teague therefore
applies, and petitioner may not obtain habeas relief on his
notice-of-evidence claim.

IV

We hold that petitioner's Brady claim is procedurally
defaulted and that his notice-of-evidence claim seeks retroactive application of a new rule. Neither claim states a
ground upon which relief may be granted in federal habeas
corpus proceedings. However, we vacate the judgment of

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
the Court of Appeals and remand the case for considerationof petitioner's misrepresentation claim in proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
Justice Ginsburg has cogently explained why well-settled law requires the reversal of the judgment of the

Court of Appeals. I join her opinion with this additionalobservation. The evidence tending to support the proposition that petitioner committed the Sorrell murders was noteven sufficient to support the filing of charges against him.
Whatever limits due process places upon the introduction ofevidence of unadjudicated conduct in capital cases, they
surely were exceeded here. Given the "vital importance"that "any decision to impose the death sentence be, and appear to be, based on reason rather than caprice or emotion,"the sentencing proceeding would have been fundamentally
unfair even if the prosecutors had given defense counsel fairnotice of their intent to offer this evidence. See

Gardner v.Florida, 430 U. S. 349, 357-358 (1977) (opinion of

Stevens,
J.).

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

Basic to due process in criminal proceedings is the rightto a full, fair, potentially effective opportunity to defend

against the State's charges. Petitioner Gray was not ac-corded that fundamental right at the penalty phase of his
trial for capital murder. I therefore conclude that no "newrule" is implicated in his petition for habeas corpus, and
dissent from the Court's decision, which denies Gray theresentencing proceeding he seeks.

I
Petitioner Coleman Gray's murder trial began on Monday,December 2, 1985, in the city of Suffolk, Virginia. He was

518US1$75P 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT
172 GRAY v. NETHERLAND

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
charged with killing Richard McClelland during the commission of a robbery, a capital offense. Va. Code Ann. $ 18.2-
31(4) (Supp. 1995). Under Virginia law, the trial would proceed in two stages: During the guilt phase, the jury would
determine whether Gray was guilty of capital murder; and
during the penalty phase, the jury would decide whether
Gray should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment.
See Va. Code Ann. $ 19.2-264.4(A) (1995).

At an in-chambers conference before the guilt phase
began, Gray's lawyers requested a court order directing
the prosecutor to disclose the evidence he would introduce
during the penalty phase if Gray were convicted.1 Defense
counsel wanted to know, in particular, whether the prosecutor planned to introduce evidence relating to the murders
of Lisa Sorrell and her 3-year-old daughter, Shanta. Defense counsel informed the trial court of the basis for the
request:

". . . Your Honor, this is my concern. We will probably at the very best stop in the middle of the day or
late in the afternoon and start the penalty trial the next
day. . . . [W]e have good reason to believe that [the prosecutor] is going to call people to introduce a statement
that our client supposedly made to another inmate that
he murdered [the Sorrells] which were very violent and
well-known crimes throughout this entire area.

"If that comes in we are going to want to know it in
advance so we can be prepared on our argument. . . . It's
absolute dynamite." 3 Joint Appendix in No. 94-4009
(CA4), pp. 1328-1329 (hereinafter J. A.).

1 This request was made pursuant to Peterson v. Commonwealth, 225
Va. 289, 302 S. E. 2d 520 (1983), which instructed that, under Virginia law,
the "preferred practice" in capital trials "is to make known to [the defendant] before trial the evidence that is to be adduced at the penalty stage if
he is found guilty." Id., at 298, 302 S. E. 2d, at 526.

173Cite as: 518 U. S. 152 (1996)
Ginsburg, J., dissenting
The Sorrell murders "were one of the most highly publicized crimes in the history of the Tidewater, Virginia area."
App. 341. In December 1984, five days after they were reported missing, Lisa and Shanta Sorrell were found dead in
a partially burned car in Chesapeake, Virginia, a city that
shares borders with Suffolk. Lisa's body was slumped in
the front passenger seat of the car; she had been shot in the
head six times. Shanta had been removed from her car seat
and locked in the trunk, where she died after inhaling smoke
produced by the fire in the car's passenger compartment.
Neither Gray nor anyone else has ever been charged with
commission of the Sorrell murders.2

In response to defense counsel's disclosure request, the
prosecutor told Gray's lawyers and the court that he would
introduce "statements" Gray had made to other inmates in
which Gray allegedly admitted killing the Sorrells. The following exchange then took place between defense counsel
Moore and prosecutor Ferguson:

"MR. MOORE: Is it going to be evidence or just his
statement?

"MR. FERGUSON: Statements that your client made.
"MR. MOORE: Nothing other than statements?
"MR. FERGUSON: To other people, that's correct.
Statements made by your client that he did these
things." 3 J. A. 1331 (emphasis added).

2 That Gray had not been convicted of killing the Sorrells would not,
under Virginia law, bar admission of evidence relating to those crimes
during the penalty phase of his trial. One of Virginia's two aggravating
circumstances requires the jury to determine whether "there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would
constitute a continuing serious threat to society." Va. Code Ann. $ 19.2-
264.2 (1995). The Virginia Supreme Court has held that "evidence of
prior unadjudicated criminal conduct . . . may be used in the penalty phase
to prove the defendant's propensity to commit criminal acts of violence in
the future." Watkins v. Commonwealth, 229 Va. 469, 488, 331 S. E. 2d
422, 436 (1985).

174 GRAY v. NETHERLAND

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
After the in-chambers conference ended, the guilt phase ofthe trial began. Three days later, at 4 o'clock on Thursday

afternoon, December 5, the jury returned a verdict findingGray guilty of the capital murder of McClelland. Proceedings were adjourned for the day, with the penalty phase to
begin at 9:30 the next morning.That evening, the prosecutor informed defense counsel

that, in addition to Gray's statements, he planned to intro-duce further evidence relating to the Sorrell murders. That
further evidence included: (1) the testimony of DetectiveSlezak, the police officer who investigated the Sorrell murders, regarding his observations at the crime scene shortly
after the bodies of Lisa and Shanta were discovered; (2)
graphic photographs of the crime scene, depicting the interior of the partially burned car, Lisa's body in the front seat,
and Shanta's body in the trunk; (3) the testimony of Doctor
Presswalla, the state medical examiner who conducted the
autopsies of the victims, regarding the causes of their deaths;
(4) graphic photographs of the victims at the time of the
autopsies, including a photograph depicting the back of Lisa's
head, shaved to reveal six gunshot wounds; and (5) Doctor
Presswalla's autopsy reports. See App. 29-37, 40-47.

This additional evidence, advanced by the prosecutor on
the eve of the penalty phase, suggested that the Sorrell murders were carried out in a manner "strikingly similar" to the
murder of McClelland. Gray v. Commonwealth, 233 Va.
313, 347, 356 S. E. 2d 157, 176 (1987). Like Lisa Sorrell,
McClelland had been shot six times in the head; his car, too,
had been partially burned. As defense counsel later explained, "the similarities between the McClelland murder
and the Sorrell murder would be obvious to anyone sitting
in a jury box." App. 141.

On Friday morning, December 6, before trial proceedings
resumed, defense counsel informed the court of Thursday
evening's developments. Gray's lawyers told the court they
had learned for the first time the previous evening that the

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
prosecutor planned to introduce evidence relating to the Sor-rell murders other than Gray's alleged statements. Counsel

stated that while they were prepared to rebut the state-ments, they were "not prepared to rebut [the additional evidence] . . . because of the shortness of notice." 4 J. A. 2065.
"We are not prepared to try the Sorrell murder today," coun-sel told the court. "We have not been given sufficient notice." Ibid.Gray's lawyers argued that the case relied on by the prosecutor, Watkins v. Commonwealth, 229 Va. 469, 331 S. E. 2d422 (1985), was distinguishable. There, counsel explained,
separate murder charges were outstanding against the defendant, and "[t]he lawyers who were representing [Watkins]
in the first murder trial were already representing him with
respect to the second murders. They were aware of all the
charges, were aware of the evidence that was available to
the Commonwealth in the second murder charge and were
in a position to confront the evidence . . . that would come
in [during] the penalty trial." 4 J. A. 2065-2066. In contrast to the situation in Watkins, counsel pointed out, "[w]e
are not prepared for any of this, other than [Gray] may have
made some incriminating statements." 4 J. A. 2067. The
trial court nonetheless ruled that the Sorrell murders evidence was "admissible at this stage of the trial." Id., at
2068.

The penalty phase of the trial then commenced. The
prosecutor, in keeping with his representations before the
guilt phase began, called Melvin Tucker to the stand.
Tucker was Gray's accomplice in the McClelland murder;
he, along with Gray, had initially been charged with capital
murder. After plea negotiations, however, the prosecutor
agreed to reduce the charge against Tucker to first-degree
murder, a noncapital offense, in exchange for Tucker's testimony against Gray. App. 339, and n. 3. Tucker testified
during the guilt phase that Gray had been the "trigger man"
in McClelland's murder.

Tucker testified at the penalty phase that, shortly afterthe McClelland robbery, he and Gray "were searching

through the newspaper for some information" on the crime.Id., at 22. According to Tucker, Gray stated that he had
"knocked off " Lisa Sorrell, and pointed to a picture of LisaSorrell in the newspaper.

(testimony of defense counsel Moore) ("Melvin Tucker hadbeen . . . extensively . . . cross-examined during the guilt
phase . . . . The same jurors who were sitting there duringthe guilt trial were there during the penalty phase and they
had been told and drawn a pretty accurate picture as to whyMelvin Tucker would strike a deal and tell anybody anything
they wanted to hear. To save his life. That didn't need tobe brought up again.").

The prosecutor then called Detective Slezak. Defensecounsel renewed their objection, outside the presence of the
jury, to admission of any evidence relating to the Sorrellmurders other than Gray's statements. Counsel reiterated
that they had "had no notice of this," and had been "takenby surprise." Id., at 25. What the prosecutor "is going
to do today," they emphasized, "is not what he said hewas going to do at the beginning of trial." Id., at 27. The
court adhered to its earlier ruling that the evidence wasadmissible.

With nothing more than Tucker's testimony linking Grayto the Sorrell murders, the trial court then allowed the
prosecutor to introduce the testimony of Detective Slezakand Doctor Presswalla, as well as crime scene and autopsy

3 As the District Court suggested, in one respect this version of events
is implausible. The McClelland murder occurred in May 1985, some six
months after the Sorrells had been killed. No newspaper from May 1985
containing a photograph of Lisa Sorrell was ever introduced into evidence.

photographs and the victims' autopsy reports. See ante, at157-158. During the defense case, Gray took the stand, admitted complicity in the McClelland murder but denied beingthe "triggerman," and denied any involvement in the Sorrell murders. App. 346-347. After closing arguments, in
which the prosecutor highlighted the similarities betweenthe Sorrell and McClelland murders, and urged that Gray's

commission of the Sorrell murders demonstrated his "futuredangerous[ness]," see

id., at 51-53, the jury fixed Gray's punishment at death.Gray unsuccessfully argued on direct appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court and in state habeas proceedings thatadmission of the additional Sorrell murders evidence violated
his right to a fair trial under the Fourteenth Amendment.
Gray then filed a federal habeas petition in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Gray

argued, among other things, that admission of the Sorrellmurders evidence violated his Fourteenth Amendment
rights. 1 J. A. 35. Specifically, he asserted:

"The Commonwealth did not disclose its intentions to
use the Sorrell murders as evidence against Gray untilsuch a late date that it was impossible for Gray's defense

counsel reasonably to prepare or defend against suchevidence at trial. Because of the late notice, . . . Gray
could not adequately prepare to defend his innocenceregarding the Sorrell murders."

Id., at 33.

The District Court concluded that other claims pressed byGray in his federal habeas petition were either procedurally

barred or meritless. The court found, however, that the
Sorrell evidence claim "was consistently raised in the State
courts and is not procedurally defaulted." Id., at 253.

After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the District
Court granted Gray a writ of habeas corpus. Relying primarily on Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349 (1977), the court
held that Gray's due process rights were violated "because

the Commonwealth failed to provide fair notice that evidenceconcerning the Sorrell murders would be introduced at his

penalty phase," App. 348; consequently, Gray became vulner-able to a death sentence on the basis of information he had
scant opportunity to deny or explain, see id., at 349-351.Recalling the prosecutor's Monday morning affirmations that
he would introduce only Gray's "statements," the DistrictCourt noted that Gray's lawyers were "clearly and justifiably
. . . shocked" when the prosecutor reported, Thursday eve-ning, his intention to introduce, the next day, further evidence on the Sorrell murders. Id., at 350. "The only Sor-rell murder evidence which [Gray's lawyers] were prepared
to challenge," the District Court recounted, "was the evi-dence [the prosecutor] indicated he would introduce at the
outset of the trial: Melvin Tucker's statement that Grayallegedly had confessed to the murders." Id., at 346. The
prosecutor's surprise move had disarmed Gray's counsel, theDistrict Court recognized, leaving them without capacity to
cross-examine Detective Slezak and Doctor Presswalla effec-tively, with the result that the Sorrell murders evidence
"carrie[d] no assurance of reliability." Id., at 351."The consequences of this surprise," the District Court
found, "could not have been more devastating." Id., at 350.Most critically, the prosecutor's "statements only" assurance
led defense counsel to forgo investigation of the details ofthe Sorrell murders, including a review of the evidence collected by the Chesapeake police department during its in-vestigation of the crimes. See ibid. Had Gray's lawyers
conducted such a review, they could have shown that noneof the forensic evidence collected by the Chesapeake police
directly linked Gray to the Sorrell murders.4 Moreover, theevidence the Chesapeake police did obtain "strongly sug4 The District Court noted, in this regard, that an investigator engaged
by Gray's federal habeas counsel had run a driving test indicating that
"Coleman Gray could not have performed the Sorrell murders on his wife's
dinner hour, as the prosecutor speculated." Id., at 345, n. 5.

gested that Timothy Sorrell"--Lisa's husband and Shanta'sfather--"actually committed the notorious murders." Id.,

at 350-351.Indeed, for a substantial period of time following the Sorrell murders, Timothy Sorrell was the prime suspect in thecase.

5 Police suspicion focused on Mr. Sorrell the night Lisa

and Shanta were found dead. When Detective Slezak andanother officer informed Mr. Sorrell of the grim discovery,

his statements and demeanor made the officers "highly sus-picious."

Id., at 186.6Police subsequently learned that Timothy Sorrell had an

apparent motive for the murders. Two weeks before Lisaand Shanta were killed, the Sorrells obtained a life insurance
policy, which designated Timothy and Shanta as beneficiariesin the event of Lisa's death. Id., at 344.

7 Lisa's parents

later filed a lawsuit to stop Mr. Sorrell from obtaining theproceeds of the insurance policy, alleging that he was responsible for Lisa's death. Ibid. In addition, police uncoveredevidence suggesting that Mr. Sorrell was involved in a stolen
merchandise ring at his place of employment, the Naval Sup-ply Center, and that Lisa "was very angry and unhappy
about her husband's apparent criminal activities." Id., at345.

5 Police designated Mr. Sorrell as the sole suspect on evidence they sent
to crime labs for analysis. Id., at 344.

6 Asked to describe what about Mr. Sorrell's demeanor made him suspicious, Slezak testified: "I don't know how to describe it other than to say
that it was not what you would expect to find in a situation like that. He
just seemed defensive." Id., at 186.

7 By contrast, police never established Gray's supposed motive for killing

the Sorrells. Lisa was found with her jewelry (a necklace and gold earrings) undisturbed, as well as cash and a postal money order for $280,
id., at 316, suggesting that robbery was not the perpetrator's motive, id.,
at 317.

8 Despite defense counsel's pretrial request for all exculpatory evidence

pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), the prosecutor never
disclosed the evidence incriminating Timothy Sorrell. Gray presented a
Brady claim in his federal habeas petition, but the District Court noted

local Commonwealth's Attorney "to determine whether itwas appropriate to prosecute Timothy Sorrell." Ibid.

Assessing the prejudicial potency of the Sorrell murdersevidence admitted at the penalty phase of Gray's trial, the

District Court concluded that the due process violation wasnot harmless.

Id., at 353. The District Court therefore va-cated Gray's death sentence, and remanded the case to the

state trial court for resentencing.The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed.
Gray v. Thompson, 58 F. 3d 59 (1995). It held that federalhabeas relief was barred because Gray's due process claim
depended on a "new rule" of constitutional law which, under
Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), could not be applied oncollateral review. The Court of Appeals accordingly remanded the case, directing the District Court to dismissGray's habeas petition.

II
A case announces a "new rule" under Teague "if the resultwas not

dictated by precedent existing at the time the de-fendant's conviction became final." Id., at 301 (plurality

opinion). Gray's conviction became final in 1987, when wedenied certiorari to review the Virginia Supreme Court's decision on direct appeal. See Gray v. Virginia, 484 U. S. 873(1987). As explained below, precedent decided well before
1987 "dictates" the conclusion that Gray was not accordeddue process at the penalty phase of his trial.

Gray's claim is encompassing, but it is fundamental.Under the Due Process Clause, he contends, a capital defendant must be afforded a meaningful opportunity to explain ordeny the evidence introduced against him at sentencing.

that the claim had not been raised in state court, and therefore held it
procedurally barred. 1 J. A. 194.

9 After Gray's trial, the local prosecutor reportedly stated in an affidavit

that Mr. Sorrell was no longer a suspect. See 2 id., at 927 (news report
in The Virginian-Pilot, Jan. 7, 1986, p. D1).

The District Court concluded that Gray was stripped of anymeaningful opportunity to explain or deny the Sorrell murders evidence, for his lawyers were unfairly "ambushed"--clearly surprised and devastatingly disarmed by the prosecutor's decision, announced on the eve of the penalty trial, to
introduce extensive evidence other than Gray's statements.App. 349-351. Gray's counsel reasonably relied on the

prosecutor's unequivocal "statements only" pledge, see id.,at 342, made at the outset of trial; based on the prosecutor's
assurances, defense counsel spent no resources trackingdown information in police records on the Sorrell murders.
The prosecutor's switch, altogether unanticipated by defense
counsel, left them with no chance to uncover, through their
own investigation, information that could have defused the
prosecutor's case, in short, without time to prepare an effective defense. Id., at 351.

The Fourth Circuit recast Gray's claim, transforming it
into an assertion of a broad constitutional right to discovery
in capital cases. See 58 F. 3d, at 64-65. This Court also
restates and reshapes Gray's claim. The Court first slices
Gray's whole claim into pieces; it then deals discretely with
each segment it "perceive[s]," ante, at 162: a "misrepresentation" claim, ante, at 166; and a supposed "notice-ofevidence" claim, ante, at 166-170. Gray, himself, however,
has "never claimed a constitutional right to advance discovery of the Commonwealth's evidence." Brief for Petitioner
46, n. 37, and accompanying text. His own claim is more
basic and should not succumb to artificial endeavors to divide
and conquer it.

There is nothing "new" in a rule that capital defendants
must be afforded a meaningful opportunity to defend against
the State's penalty phase evidence. As this Court affirmed
more than a century ago: "Common justice requires that no
man shall be condemned in his person or property without
. . . an opportunity to make his defence." Baldwin v. Hale,
1 Wall. 223, 233 (1864). See also Windsor v. McVeigh, 93

U. S. 274, 277 (1876). A pro forma opportunity will not do.10Due process demands an opportunity to be heard "at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner." Armstrong v.Manzo, 380 U. S. 545, 552 (1965); see In re Oliver, 333 U. S.
257, 275 (1948) (defendant must be afforded "a reasonableopportunity to meet [the charges against him] by way of
defense or explanation"); Morgan v. United States, 304 U. S.1, 18 (1938) ("The right to a hearing embraces not only
the right to present evidence but also a reasonable opportu-nity to know the claims of the opposing party and to meet
them."). Absent a full, fair, potentially effective opportu-nity to defend against the State's charges, the right to a
hearing would be "but a barren one." Ibid.; see Mullane v.Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U. S. 306, 315 (1950)
("process which is a mere gesture is not due process").In Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349 (1977), the principal
decision relied on by the District Court, we confirmed thatthe sentencing phase of a capital trial "must satisfy the
requirements of the Due Process Clause." Id., at 358 (plu-rality opinion).

Gardner presented the question whether adefendant was denied due process when the trial judge sentenced him to death relying in part on a presentence report,including a confidential portion not disclosed to defense counsel. Counsel's deprivation of an "opportunity . . . to chal-lenge the accuracy or materiality" of the undisclosed information, id., at 356, the Gardner plurality reasoned, left amanifest risk that "some of the information accepted in confidence may [have been] erroneous, or . . . misinterpreted,"

10 Cf. In re Gault, 387 U. S. 1, 33 (1967) (notice to parents the night
before a juvenile delinquency hearing was constitutionally inadequate; due
process requires that notice "be given sufficiently in advance of scheduled
court proceedings so that reasonable opportunity to prepare will be afforded"); Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 58 (1932) (defense counsel
appointed the morning of trial could not satisfy the constitutional requirement because counsel lacked opportunity to investigate the case;
Court observed that "[t]o decide otherwise, would simply be to ignore
actualities").

id., at 359. As a basis for a death sentence, Gardnerteaches, information unexposed to adversary testing does

not qualify as reliable. See ibid. The Gardner Courtvacated the defendant's sentence, concluding that he "was
denied due process of law when the death [penalty] was
imposed, at least in part, on the basis of information whichhe had no opportunity to deny or explain."

Id., at 362.
Urging that Gardner fails to "dictate" a decision for Grayhere, the Commonwealth relies on the Fourth Circuit's reasoning to this effect: Gardner was a case about "secrecy";Gray's case is about "surprise." See 58 F. 3d, at 65. Therefore, Gray seeks an extension, not an application, of Gardner,
see Brief for Respondent 30, in Teague parlance, a "new
rule," Brief for Respondent 31. It would be an impermissible "leap," the Fourth Circuit maintained, to equate to a
failure to disclose, a disclosure in fact made, "but allegedly
so late as to be unfair." 58 F. 3d, at 65.

Teague is not the straitjacket the Commonwealth misunderstands it to be. Teague requires federal courts to decide
a habeas petitioner's constitutional claims according to the
"law prevailing at the time [his] conviction became final."
489 U. S., at 306 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks
omitted). But Teague does not bar federal habeas courts
from applying, in "a myriad of factual contexts," law that is
settled--here, the right to a meaningful chance to defend
against or explain charges pressed by the State. See
Wright v. West, 505 U. S. 277, 309 (1992) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) ("Where the beginning point is a rule
of this general application, a rule designed for the specific
purpose of evaluating a myriad of factual contexts, it will be
the infrequent case that yields a result so novel that it forges
a new rule, one not dictated by precedent.").

The District Court did not "forg[e] a new rule," ibid., by
holding, on the facts of this case, that Gray was denied a
meaningful opportunity to challenge the Sorrell murders evidence. Ordinarily, it is incumbent upon defense counsel,

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
after receiving adequate notice of the triable issues, to pur-sue whatever investigation is needed to rebut relevant evidence the State may introduce. Here, however, in keepingwith the practice approved by Virginia's highest court, see
supra, at 172, and n. 1, the prosecutor expressly delineatedthe scope and character of the evidence he would introduce
with respect to the Sorrell murders: nothing other thanstatements Gray himself allegedly made, see

supra, at 173.Gray's lawyers reasonably relied on the prosecutor's "statements only" assurance by forgoing inquiry into the details ofthe Sorrell crimes. Resource-consuming investigation, they
responsibly determined, was unnecessary to cast doubt on
the veracity of inmate "snitch" testimony, the only evidencethe prosecutor initially said he would offer.

Gray's lawyers were undeniably caught short by the prose-cutor's startling announcement, the night before the penalty
phase was to begin, that he would in effect put on a "mini-trial" of the Sorrell murders. At that point, Gray's lawyers
could not possibly conduct the investigation and preparationnecessary to counter the prosecutor's newly announced evidence. Thus, at the penalty trial, defense counsel were reduced nearly to the role of spectators. Lacking proof, lateruncovered, that "strongly suggested" Timothy Sorrell, not

Gray, was the actual killer, App. 350-351, Gray's lawyerscould mount only a feeble cross-examination of Detective
Slezak; counsel simply inquired of the detective whetherhighly publicized crimes could prompt "copycat" crimes,
see id., at 37-40. Gray's lawyers had no questions at all forDoctor Presswalla, the medical examiner who testified about
the Sorrell autopsies. Id., at 47.11

11 The Court attaches weight to the failure of Gray's lawyers to ask explicitly for deferral of the penalty phase. See ante, at 167, 169. It is
uncontested that defense counsel made no formal motion for a continuance.
But as the District Court described the morning-of-trial episode, counsel
"plea[ded] for additional time to prepare." App. 343. And as earlier
noted, see supra, at 174-175, counsel was explicit about the dilemma con518US1$75P 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
In sum, the record shows, beyond genuine debate, that
Gray was not afforded a "meaningful" opportunity to defend
against the additional Sorrell murders evidence. The fatal
infection present in Gardner infects this case as well: Defense counsel were effectively deprived of an opportunity to
challenge the "accuracy or materiality" of information relied
on in imposing the death sentence. Gardner, 430 U. S., at
356. Unexposed to adversary testing, the Sorrell murders
evidence "carrie[d] no assurance of reliability." App. 351.
The "debate between adversaries," valued in our system of
justice for its contribution "to the truth-seeking function of
trials," Gardner, 430 U. S., at 360, was precluded here by
the prosecutor's eve-of-sentencing shift, and the trial court's
tolerance of it. To hold otherwise "would simply be to
ignore actualities." Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 58
(1932).12

fronting the defense: "We are not prepared to try the Sorrell murder
today." 4 J. A. 2065. The Court's suggestion that "this plea [was] insufficient to have legal effect in court," ante, at 167, n. 4, is puzzling. Neither
the Court, the Fourth Circuit, nor the Commonwealth has cited any Virginia authority for this proposition. Cf. Smith v. Estelle, 602 F. 2d 694,
701, n. 8 (CA5 1979) ("the state points us to no rule of Texas law saying
that moving for a continuance is the only way to object to surprise"), aff 'd
on other grounds, 451 U. S. 454 (1981). Given the potency of the evidence
in question, it is difficult to comprehend the Court's speculation that defense counsel, for "tactical" reasons, may have wanted only exclusion and
not more time. Compare ante, at 169, with Tr. of Oral Arg. 11 (counsel
for petitioner urged that if a trial judge is asked, "please stop this from
happening . . . , it violates my [client's] right to a fair trial," the existence
of that right should not turn on whether counsel next says, "please exclude
this evidence, as opposed to please give me more time").

12 Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U. S. 545 (1977), featured by the Court,

see ante, at 168, 169-170, hardly controls this case. There, the State's
witness, and not the prosecutor, misled defense counsel. 429 U. S., at 560.
Furthermore, Weatherford did not involve the penalty phase of a capital
trial, a stage at which reliability concerns are most vital. Finally, the
defendant in Weatherford did not object at trial to the surprise witness,
and did not later show how he was prejudiced by the surprise. Id., at 561.

LANE v. PENA, SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION,

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 95-365. Argued April 15, 1996--Decided June 20, 1996
Respondents terminated petitioner Lane's enrollment at the United States

Merchant Marine Academy on the ground that his recently diagnosed
diabetes mellitus rendered him ineligible to be commissioned for service
in the Navy/Merchant Marine Reserve Program or as a Naval Reserve
Officer. Alleging that his separation from the Academy violated

$ 504(a) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973--which prohibits, among other
things, discrimination on the basis of disability "under any program or
activity conducted by any Executive agency"--Lane brought this suit
seeking reinstatement to the Academy, compensatory damages, and
other remedies. The District Court ordered him reinstated, but ultimately ruled that he must be denied compensatory damages because
Congress has not waived the Federal Government's sovereign immunity
against monetary damages awards for $ 504(a) violations. The Court of
Appeals summarily affirmed.

Held: Congress has not waived the Government's sovereign immunity

against monetary damages awards for $ 504(a) violations. Pp. 191-200.

(a) The requisite "unequivocal expression" of congressional intent to
grant such a waiver, see, e. g., Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,
498 U. S. 89, 95, is lacking in the text of $ 505(a)(2), which decrees that
the remedies available for violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964--including monetary damages awards, see, e. g., Franklin v.
Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60, 70--apply also to $ 504(a)
violations "by any . . . Federal provider of [financial] assistance." This
provision makes no mention whatsoever of "program[s] or activit[ies]
conducted by any Executive agency," the plainly more far-reaching language Congress employed in $ 504(a) itself. The lack of the necessary
clarity of expression in $ 505(a)(2) is underscored by the precision with
which Congress has waived the Government's sovereign immunity in

$$ 501 and 505(a)(1) of the Act and in the Civil Rights Act of 1991.
Lane's contention that the larger statutory scheme indicates congressional intent to "level the playing field" by subjecting the Government
to the same remedies as any and all other $ 504(a) defendants is rejected.

(b) The "equalization" provision of $ 1003 of the Rehabilitation Act
Amendments of 1986--which, after waiving the States' Eleventh
Amendment immunity from federal-court suit for violations of $ 504 and
other civil rights statutes, specifies that legal and equitable remedies
are available in such a suit "to the same extent as . . . in the suit against
any public or private entity other than a State"--does not reveal congressional intent to equalize the remedies available against all defendants for $ 504(a) violations, such that federal agencies, like private entities, must be subject to monetary damages. Although Lane's argument
to this effect is not without force, it is ultimately defeated by the existence of at least two other conceivable, if not entirely satisfactory, interpretations of the equalization provision: (1) that "public . . . entit[ies]"
refers to the nonfederal public entities receiving federal financial assistance that are covered by each of the referenced federal statutes; and (2)
that "public or private entit[ies]" is meant only to subject the States to
the scope of remedies available against either public or private $ 504
defendants, whatever the lesser (or perhaps the greater) of those remedies might be. Pp. 197-200.

I
The United States Merchant Marine Academy is a federalservice academy that trains students to serve as commercial

merchant marine officers and as commissioned officers in theUnited States Armed Forces. The Academy is administered
by the Maritime Administration, an organization within theDepartment of Transportation. Petitioner James Griffin
Lane entered the Academy as a first-year student in July1991 after meeting the Academy's requirements for appointment, including passing a physical examination conducted bythe Department of Defense. During his first year at the
Academy, however, Lane was diagnosed by a private physi-cian as having diabetes mellitus. Lane reported the diagnosis to the Academy's Chief Medical Officer. The Academy'sPhysical Examination Review Board conducted a hearing
in September 1992 to determine Lane's "medical suitability"to continue at the Academy, following which the Board
reported to the Superintendent of the Academy that Lanesuffered from insulin-dependent diabetes.

In December 1992, Lane was separated from the Academyon the ground that his diabetes was a "disqualifying condition," rendering him ineligible to be commissioned for serv-ice in the Navy/Merchant Marine Reserve Program or as a
Naval Reserve Officer. After unsuccessfully challenging hisseparation before the Maritime Administrator, Lane brought

court ordered Lane reinstated to the Academy, and the Gov-ernment did not dispute the propriety of this injunctive relief. The Government did, however, dispute the proprietyof a compensatory damages award, claiming that the United
States was protected against a damages suit by the doctrine
of sovereign immunity. The District Court disagreed; itruled that Lane was entitled to a compensatory damages

award against the Government for its violation of $ 504(a),but deferred resolution of the specific amount of damages
due. 867 F. Supp. 1050 (DC 1994).Shortly thereafter, however, the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit ruled in Dorsey v. United States
Dept. of Labor, 41 F. 3d 1551 (1994), that the Act did not
waive the Federal Government's sovereign immunity against
monetary damages for violations of $ 504(a). The court denied compensatory damages based on the absence, in any
statutory text, of an "unequivocal expression" of congressional intent to waive the Government's immunity as to monetary damages, and this Court's instruction that waivers of
sovereign immunity may not be implied, see, e. g., Irwin v.
Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95 (1990).

In light of Dorsey, the District Court vacated its prior
order to the extent that it awarded damages to Lane and
held that Lane was not entitled to a compensatory damages
award against the Federal Government. App. to Pet. for
Cert. 5a-6a. Lane appealed. The Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit first rejected Lane's request for
initial en banc review to reconsider Dorsey, then granted the

Section 504(a) of the Act provides that

"[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability inthe United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or

his disability, be excluded from the participation in, bedenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination
under any program or activity receiving Federal finan-cial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency or by the United StatesPostal Service." 29 U. S. C. $ 794(a).

Section 505(a)(2) of the Act describes the remedies availablefor a violation of $ 504(a): "The remedies, procedures, and
rights set forth in title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964shall be available to any person aggrieved by any act or
failure to act by any recipient of Federal assistance or Fed-eral provider of such assistance under [$ 504]." $ 794a(a)(2).
Because Title VI provides for monetary damages awards,see Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S.
60, 70 (1992) (noting that "a clear majority" of the Court con-firmed in

Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of NewYork City, 463 U. S. 582 (1983), that damages are available

under Title VI for intentional violations thereof), Lane reads$$ 504(a) and 505(a)(2) together to establish a waiver of the
Federal Government's sovereign immunity against monetarydamages awards for violations of $ 504(a) committed by Executive agencies.

192 LANE v. PENA

Opinion of the Court
While Lane's analysis has superficial appeal, it overlooksone critical requirement firmly grounded in our precedents:

A waiver of the Federal Government's sovereign immunitymust be unequivocally expressed in statutory text, see,

e. g.,
United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 33-34, 37
(1992), and will not be implied, Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, supra, at 95. Moreover, a waiver of the Government's sovereign immunity will be strictly construed, interms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign. See,

e. g.,
United States v. Williams, 514 U. S. 527, 531 (1995) (whenconfronted with a purported waiver of the Federal Government's sovereign immunity, the Court will "constru[e] ambiguities in favor of immunity"); Library of Congress v. Shaw,
478 U. S. 310, 318 (1986); Lehman v. Nakshian, 453 U. S. 156,
161 (1981) ("[L]imitations and conditions upon which the
Government consents to be sued must be strictly observed
and exceptions thereto are not to be implied"). To sustain
a claim that the Government is liable for awards of monetary
damages, the waiver of sovereign immunity must extend unambiguously to such monetary claims. Nordic Village, 503
U. S., at 34. A statute's legislative history cannot supply a
waiver that does not appear clearly in any statutory text;
"the `unequivocal expression' of elimination of sovereign
immunity that we insist upon is an expression in statutory
text." Id., at 37.

The clarity of expression necessary to establish a waiver
of the Government's sovereign immunity against monetary
damages for violations of $ 504 is lacking in the text of the
relevant provisions. The language of $ 505(a)(2), the remedies provision, is telling. In that section, Congress decreed
that the remedies available for violations of Title VI would
be similarly available for violations of $ 504(a) "by any recipient of Federal assistance or Federal provider of such assistance." 29 U. S. C. $ 794a(a)(2). This provision makes no
mention whatsoever of "program[s] or activit[ies] conducted
by any Executive agency," the plainly more far-reaching

193Cite as: 518 U. S. 187 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
language Congress employed in $ 504(a) itself. Whatever
might be said about the somewhat curious structure of the
liability and remedy provisions, it cannot be disputed that a
reference to "Federal provider[s]" of financial assistance in

$ 505(a)(2) does not, without more, establish that Congress
has waived the Federal Government's immunity against
monetary damages awards beyond the narrow category of

$ 504(a) violations committed by federal funding agencies
acting as such--that is, by "Federal provider[s]."

The lack of clarity in $ 505(a)(2)'s "Federal provider" provision is underscored by the precision with which Congress
has waived the Federal Government's sovereign immunity
from compensatory damages claims for violations of $ 501
of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U. S. C. $ 791, which prohibits
discrimination on the basis of disability in employment decisions by the Federal Government. In $ 505(a)(1), Congress
expressly waived the Federal Government's sovereign immunity against certain remedies for violations of $ 501:

"The remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [which allows
monetary damages] . . . shall be available, with respect
to any complaint under section 501 of this Act, to any
employee or applicant for employment aggrieved by the
final disposition of such complaint, or by the failure
to take final action on such complaint." 29 U. S. C.

$ 794a(a)(1).

Section 505(a)(1)'s broad language--"any complaint under
section 501"--suggests by comparison with $ 505(a)(2) that
Congress did not intend to treat all $ 504(a) defendants alike
with regard to remedies. Had Congress wished to make
Title VI remedies available broadly for all $ 504(a) violations,
it could easily have used language in $ 505(a)(2) that is
as sweeping as the "any complaint" language contained in

$ 505(a)(1).

518US1$76J 05-18-99 21:03:36 PAGES OPINPGT
194 LANE v. PENA

Opinion of the Court
But our analysis need not end there. In the Civil RightsAct of 1991, Congress made perfectly plain that compensatory damages would be available for certain violationsof $ 501 by the Federal Government (as well as other $ 501
defendants), subject to express limitations:

"In an action brought by a complaining party under thepowers, remedies, and procedures set forth in . . . section

794a(a)(1) of title 29 [which applies to violations of $ 501by the Federal Government] . . . against a respondent
who engaged in unlawful intentional discrimination (notan employment practice that is unlawful because of its
disparate impact) under section 791 of title 29 and theregulations implementing section 791 of title 29, or who
violated the requirements of section 791 of title 29 orthe regulations implementing section 791 of title 29 concerning the provision of a reasonable accommodation, . . .the complaining party may recover compensatory and
punitive damages as allowed in subsection (b) of thissection . . . from the respondent." Rev. Stat. $ 1977A,
as added, 105 Stat. 1072, 42 U. S. C. $ 1981a(a)(2).
The Act's attorney's fee provision makes a similar point.Section 505(b) provides that, "[i]n any action or proceeding

to enforce or charge a violation of a provision of this title,the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party,
other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee aspart of the costs." 29 U. S. C. $ 794a(b). This provision
likewise illustrates Congress' ability to craft a clear waiverof the Federal Government's sovereign immunity against
particular remedies for violations of the Act. The clarity ofthese provisions is in sharp contrast to the waiver Lane
seeks to tease out of $$ 504 and 505(a)(2) of the Act.Lane insists nonetheless that $ 505(a)(2) compels a result
in his favor, arguing that the Department of Transportationis a "Federal provider" within the meaning of $ 505(a)(2) and
thus is liable for a compensatory damages award regardless

Opinion of the Court
of our resolution of the broader sovereign immunity question. Reply Brief for Petitioner 8-9. We disagree. The
Department of Transportation, whatever its other activities,
is not a "Federal provider" of financial assistance with respect to the Merchant Marine Academy, which the Department itself administers through the Maritime Administration. At oral argument, Lane's counsel effectively conceded
as much. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7 (acknowledging that the
Department of Transportation is not a federal provider with
respect to the Academy "because of this Court's decision in
[Department of Transp. v. Paralyzed Veterans of America,
477 U. S. 597, 612 (1986)], which indicates that funds that
are actually provided to an entity that the Federal Government manages itself, which is what DOT does here . . . for
the Merchant Marine Academy," do not render the agency a
"Federal provider"). Lane argues that $ 505(a)(2)'s reference to "Federal provider[s]" is not limited by the text of the
provision itself to the funding activities of those providers, but instead reaches "any act" of an agency that serves
as a "Federal provider" in any context. Reply Brief for
Petitioner 9, and n. 11. In light of our established practice
of construing waivers of sovereign immunity narrowly in
favor of the sovereign, however, we decline Lane's invitation
to read the statutory language so broadly.

Lane next encourages us to look not only at the language
of the liability and remedies provisions but at the larger statutory scheme, from which he would discern congressional
intent to "level the playing field" by subjecting the Federal
Government to the same remedies as any and all other

$ 504(a) defendants. A statutory scheme that would subject
the Federal Government to awards of injunctive relief, attorney's fees, and monetary damages when it acts as a "Federal
provider," but would not subject it to monetary damages
awards when, and only when, a federal Executive agency
itself commits a violation of $ 504(a), Lane posits, is so illogi518US1$76J 05-18-99 21:03:36 PAGES OPINPGT
196 LANE v. PENA

Opinion of the Court
cal as to foreclose the conclusion that Congress intended tocreate such a scheme.

The statutory scheme on which Lane hinges his argumentis admittedly somewhat bewildering. But the lack of perfect correlation in the various provisions does not indicate,
as Lane suggests, that the reading proposed by the Govern-ment is entirely irrational. It is plain that Congress is free

to waive the Federal Government's sovereign immunityagainst liability without waiving its immunity from monetary damages awards. The Administrative Procedure Act(APA) illustrates this nicely. Under the provisions of the
APA, "[a] person suffering legal wrong because of agency
action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action
within the meaning of a relevant statute," is expressly authorized to bring "[a]n action in a court of the United States
seeking relief other than money damages and stating a claim
that an agency or an officer or employee thereof acted or
failed to act in an official capacity or under color of legal
authority." 5 U. S. C. $ 702 (emphasis added).

In any event, Lane's "equal treatment" argument largely
misses the crucial point that, when it comes to an award of
money damages, sovereign immunity places the Federal Government on an entirely different footing than private parties.
Petitioner's reliance on Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public
Schools, 503 U. S. 60 (1992), then, is misplaced. In Franklin, we held only that the implied private right of action
under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 supports a claim for monetary damages. "[A]bsent clear direction to the contrary by Congress," we stated, "the federal
courts have the power to award any appropriate relief in a
cognizable cause of action brought pursuant to a federal statute." Id., at 70-71. Franklin, however, involved an action
against nonfederal defendants under Title IX. Although the
Government does not contest the propriety of the injunctive
relief Lane obtained, the Federal Government's sovereign
immunity prohibits wholesale application of Franklin to ac518US1$76J 05-18-99 21:03:36 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tions against the Government to enforce $ 504(a). As theGovernment puts it, "[w]here a cause of action is authorized

against the federal government, the available remedies arenot those that are `appropriate,' but only those for which
sovereign immunity has been expressly waived." Brief forRespondents 28.

And Lane's "equal treatment" argument falters as well ona point previously discussed: Section 505(a)(2) itself indicates
congressional intent to treat federal Executive agencies differently from other $ 504(a) defendants for purposes of reme-dies. See supra, at 192-193. The existence of the $ 505(a)

(2) remedies provision brings this case outside the "generalrule" we discussed in

Franklin: This is not a case in which "aright of action exists to enforce a federal right and Congress

is silent on the question of remedies." 503 U. S., at 69. TitleIX, the statute at issue in Franklin, made no mention of
available remedies. Id., at 71. The Rehabilitation Act, bysharp contrast, contains a provision labeled "Remedies and
attorney fees," $ 505. Congress has thus spoken to the ques-tion of remedies in $ 505(a)(2), the only "remedies" provision
directly addressed to $ 504 violations, and has done so in away that suggests that it did not in fact intend to waive the
Federal Government's sovereign immunity against monetarydamages awards for Executive agencies' violations of $ 504(a).
Given the existence of a statutory provision that is directedprecisely to the remedies available for violations of $ 504, it
would be a curious application of our sovereign immunityjurisprudence to conclude, as the dissent appears to do, see
post, at 209-210, that the lack of clear reference to Executiveagencies in any express remedies provision indicates congressional intent to subject the Federal Government to mon-etary damages.

III
Even if $$ 504(a) and 505(a)(2) together do not establishthe requisite unequivocal waiver of immunity, Lane insists,

the "equalization" provision contained in $ 1003 of the Reha518US1$76J 05-18-99 21:03:36 PAGES OPINPGT
198 LANE v. PENA

Opinion of the Court
bilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 100 Stat. 1845, 42 U. S. C.$ 2000d-7, reveals congressional intent to equalize the remedies available against all defendants for $ 504(a) violations.Section 1003 was enacted in response to our decision in Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234 (1985), wherewe held that Congress had not unmistakably expressed its
intent to abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immu-nity in the Rehabilitation Act, and that the States accordingly were not "subject to suit in federal court by litigantsseeking retroactive monetary relief under $ 504."

Id., at235. By enacting $ 1003, Congress sought to provide the

sort of unequivocal waiver that our precedents demand.That section provides:

"(1) A State shall not be immune under the EleventhAmendment . . . from suit in Federal court for a violation
of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, title IXof the Education Amendments of 1972, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of1964, or the provisions of any other Federal statute
prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federalfinancial assistance.

"(2) In a suit against a State for a violation of a stat-ute referred to in paragraph (1), remedies (including
remedies both at law and in equity) are available forsuch a violation to the same extent as such remedies are
available for such a violation in the suit against any pub-lic or private entity other than a State." 42 U. S. C.

$ 2000d-7(a).
The "public entities" to which $ 1003 refers, Lane concludes,must include the federal Executive agencies named in

$ 504(a), and those agencies must be subject to the sameremedies under $ 504(a), including monetary damages, as are
private entities.Although Lane's argument is not without some force,

$ 1003 ultimately cannot bear the weight Lane would assign

518US1$76J 05-18-99 21:03:36 PAGES OPINPGT

199Cite as: 518 U. S. 187 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
it. The equalization provision is susceptible of at least two
interpretations other than the across-the-board leveling of
liability and remedies that Lane proposes. Under the first
such interpretation, as proposed by the Government, the
"public . . . entit[ies]" to which the statute refers are "the
non-federal public entities receiving federal financial assistance that are covered by" each of the statutes to which

$ 1003(a)(1) refers: The Rehabilitation Act, Title VI, Title
IX, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. Brief for Respondents 22. The Government's suggestion is a plausible
one: that $ 1003(a)(2) refers to municipal hospitals, local
school districts, and the like, which are unquestionably subject to each of the Acts listed in $ 1003(a)(1). Section 504
alone among the listed Acts, however, extends its coverage
to "program[s] or activit[ies] conducted by any Executive
agency."

Section 1003 is also open to a second interpretation, one
similar to the "leveling" interpretation suggested by petitioner: By reference to "public or private entit[ies]," Congress meant only to subject the States to the scope of
remedies available against either public or private $ 504
defendants, whatever the lesser (or perhaps the greater) of
those remedies might be. Lane's reading of the statute--
one that would suggest that all $ 504(a) defendants, including
the States, are subject to precisely the same remedies for
violations of that provision--would effectively read out of
the statute the very language on which he seeks to rely.
That is, if the same remedies are available against all governmental and nongovernmental defendants under $ 504(a), the
"public or private" language is entirely superfluous. Congress could have achieved the result Lane suggests simply
by subjecting States to the same remedies available against
"every other entity," without further elaboration. The fact
that $ 1003(a)(2) itself separately mentions public and private
entities suggests that there is a distinction to be made in

200 LANE v. PENA

Stevens, J., dissenting
terms of the remedies available against the two classes ofdefendants.

Although neither of these conceivable readings of$ 1003(a)(2) is entirely satisfactory, their existence points up
a fact fatal to Lane's argument: Section 1003(a) is not so freefrom ambiguity that we can comfortably conclude, based
thereon, that Congress intended to subject the Federal Gov-ernment to awards of monetary damages for violations of

$ 504(a) of the Act. Given the care with which Congress re-sponded to our decision in

Atascadero by crafting an unam-biguous waiver of the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity in $ 1003, it would be ironic indeed to conclude that thatsame provision "unequivocally" establishes a waiver of the
Federal Government's sovereign immunity against monetarydamages awards by means of an admittedly ambiguous reference to "public . . . entit[ies]" in the remedies provisionattached to the unambiguous waiver of the States' sovereign immunity.For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

damages against a federal Executive agency that violates$ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U. S. C. $ 794. To
reach this unfortunate result, the majority ignores the Act's

from the Merchant Marine Academy because he has diabetes.Lane was injured by that violation, and he is therefore entitled to maintain an action against the agency under $ 504.The parties and the Court agree that damages are an appropriate form of relief for most violations of $ 504, includingwrongful conduct by private recipients of federal funding,
by state actors, and by federal agencies acting in a fundingcapacity. The only issue in the case is whether Congress
carved out a special immunity from damages liability for fed-eral agencies acting in a nonfunding capacity, as the Department of Transportation was acting in this instance. I thinkit plain that Congress did not.

I
Congress passed the Rehabilitation Act to "develop andimplement, through research, training, services, and the

guarantee of equal opportunity, comprehensive and coordi-nated programs of vocational rehabilitation and independent
living" for the disabled. 29 U. S. C. $ 701, as amended byPub. L. 95-602, Title I, $ 122(a)(1), 92 Stat. 2984. As originally enacted in 1973, $ 504 of the Act provided:

"No otherwise qualified handicapped individual in theUnited States . . . shall, solely by reason of his handicap,

be excluded from the participation in, be denied the ben-efits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."Pub. L. 93-112, 87 Stat. 394.

Although the Court pays scant attention to the principle, wehave previously held that congressional intent with respect
to a statutory provision must be interpreted in the lightof the contemporary legal context.

Franklin v. GwinnettCounty Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60, 71 (1992). A review of

the relevant authorities convinces me that $ 504 created aprivate cause of action with a damages remedy.

The text of $ 504 was modeled on the language of $ 601of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits

Stevens, J., dissenting
discrimination by any recipient of federal funds on the basisof race, color, or national origin.

1 Following passage of Title

VI, federal courts unanimously held that $ 601 created a pri-vate cause of action. See

Cannon v. University of Chicago,
441 U. S. 677, 696 (1979). Although we have never expressly
ruled on the question, our opinion in Cannon implicitly rati-fied that judgment.

Id., at 703.
Our explicit holding in Cannon was that Title IX of the
Education Amendments of 1972, which was also patterned on
Title VI, created a private cause of action.2 This conclusion
stemmed, in part, from our understanding that Congress
meant Title IX to be interpreted and applied in the same
manner as Title VI. Id., at 696. We presumed, consistent
with well-established principles of statutory interpretation,
that Congress was aware of the relevant legal context when
it passed Title IX. Id., at 696-697. We also noted that between the enactment of Title VI in 1964 and the enactment
of Title IX in 1972 we had consistently found implied remedies in less clear statutory text. Id., at 698.

Congress passed $ 504 in 1973, just one year after
enacting Title IX. Relying on analysis like that set
forth in Cannon, the Courts of Appeals have uniformly
held that Congress intended $ 504 to provide a private
right of action for victims of prohibited discrimination.3

1 The precise language of $ 601 is as follows: "No person in the United
States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded
from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d.

2 Section 901 of Title IX provides: "No person in the United States shall,

on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or
activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . ." 86 Stat. 373, as
amended, 20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a).

Our decision in Franklin v. Gwinnett County PublicSchools, 503 U. S. 60 (1992), makes it equally clear that all

traditional forms of relief, including damages, are availablein a private action to enforce $ 504. In

Franklin we heldthat a plaintiff could seek monetary damages against a school

system accused of violating her rights under Title IX. Wecanvassed the long history of the principle that "where legal
rights have been invaded, and a federal statute provides fora general right to sue for such invasion, federal courts may
use any available remedy to make good the wrong done."
Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684 (1946). See Franklin, 503U. S., at 65-71. Applying this rule to the implied cause of

action in Title IX, we rejected the government's contentionthat "whatever the traditional presumption may have been
when the Court decided Bell v. Hood, it has disappeared insucceeding decades." Id., at 68. From Franklin it follows
ineluctably that the original version of $ 504--enacted, itbears repeating, one year after Title IX--authorized a damages remedy for persons aggrieved by violations of the pro-vision's discrimination ban.

the basis of handicap to cover the actions of federal Execu-tive agencies. The amendment was part of a lengthy piece

of legislation intended to strengthen the protections embod-ied in the original Act. See Rehabilitation, Comprehensive
Services, and Developmental Disabilities Amendments of1978, Pub. L. 95-602, 92 Stat. 2955 (statement of purpose).
The legislation evidenced Congress' continued commitmentto the broad goals of the earlier Act by, for example, adding
provisions aimed at improving accountability and enforce-ment, see,

e. g., Pub. L. 95-602, Title I, $$ 122(a)(10), 106,109(4), 29 U. S. C. $$ 711-715, 751, 761b; expanding federal

support for research programs, see, e. g., Pub. L. 95-602,Title I, $$ 109(4), 104(c)(1), 29 U. S. C. $$ 761a, 762a; augmenting funding for projects such as job training and the removalof physical barriers in public places, see,

e. g., Pub. L. 95-602,Title I, $$ 116(2), 120(a), 29 U. S. C. $ 777 et seq., $ 794b; and

creating local rehabilitation centers across the Nation, seePub. L. 95-602, Title I, $ 115(a), 29 U. S. C. $ 775. Together,
the amendments represented a substantial financial invest-ment in the future of the disabled in this country.

As part of this general expansion of the original Act, Con-gress amended $ 504 to forbid discrimination against the
handicapped "under any program or activity receiving Fed-eral financial assistance or under any program or activity
conducted by any Executive agency or by the United StatesPostal Service."

dress here is whether this unambiguous extension of $ 504to federal agencies was meant to waive the Government's

sovereign immunity to damages liability. The answer issurely "yes." Section 504 as originally enacted was understood to create a private right of action for aggrieved individuals and to authorize a damages remedy. Congress, acting in 1978, had no reason to expect the courts to require a
clearer statement respecting the remedies available against
a federal defendant than those available against any other

$ 504 defendant. And the text of the amendment--which
simply inserted the phrase extending coverage to federal
agencies into the existing sentence prohibiting discrimination by federal grantees--gives no indication whatsoever
that Congress intended to create a different remedial scheme
for the agencies.

The Court rejects this conclusion, however, because it
reads another part of the 1978 amendment, $ 505(a)(2), as a
limitation on the remedies available against Executive agencies under $ 504. In my judgment, the Court errs by misinterpreting the language and structure of $ 505 and ignoring
its legislative history.

Congress' intent to strengthen the Act's protections is
clearly evident in $ 505. The inclusion of an attorney's fees
provision in $ 505(b) fortified the Act's enforcement mechanisms. This assistance to plaintiffs was necessary, according
to the Senate Report accompanying the amendments, because "the rights extended to handicapped individuals under
title V . . . are, and will remain, in need of constant vigilance by handicapped individuals to assure compliance . . . ."
S. Rep. No. 95-890, p. 19 (1978).6

The remedies provision, $ 505(a), was also meant to ensure
compliance with the 1973 Act, not to restrict remedies that
Congress had made available under $ 504, as the majority

6 Section 505 originated in the Senate.

would have it. The section's legislative history demon-strates Congress' intent.

Between the enactment of $ 504 in 1973 and the passage of$ 505(a)(2) in 1978,

7 the Department of Health, Education,

and Welfare promulgated model regulations for federal agen-cies to use in implementing the antidiscrimination principle

announced in $ 504. See 43 Fed. Reg. 2132 (1978).8 Be-cause of the common understanding that $ 504 was patterned
on $ 601 of Title VI, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d, and intended to beenforced in the same manner,

9 the Department simply directed the agencies to follow the procedures they used toenforce Title VI. See 43 Fed. Reg. 2137, $ 85.5 (1978). This

directive resulted in uniform enforcement mechanisms forallegations of discrimination by federal grantees on the basis
of handicap, race, color, or national origin.10 Moreover, itavoided needless duplication of effort. Section 601 is accompanied by additional provisions explaining Congress' in7 The full text of $ 505(a)(2) reads as follows: "The remedies, procedures,
and rights set forth in title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 shall be
available to any person aggrieved by any act or failure to act by any recipient of Federal assistance or Federal provider of such assistance under
section 504 of this Act." 29 U. S. C. $ 794a(a)(2).

8 The Department acted pursuant to a directive from President Ford.

See Exec. Order No. 11914, "Nondiscrimination With Respect to the Handicapped in Federally Assisted Programs," issued on April 28, 1976; 41 Fed.
Reg. 17871. Congress had encouraged the President to take this step.
See Conference Report on 1974 Amendments, at 28 ("The Secretary of the
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, because of that Department's experience in dealing with handicapped persons and with the elimination of discrimination in other areas, should assume responsibility for
coordinating the section 504 enforcement effort . . . . The conferees . . .
urge . . . delegation of responsibility to the Secretary [through an Executive Order]").

9 See id., at 27 (the "language of section 504, in following [Title VI and

Title IX], . . . envisions the implementation of a compliance program which
is similar to those Acts").

10 Congress plainly intended this result. See ibid. ("This approach to

implementation of section 504 . . . would . . . provide for administrative
due process").

tentions with respect to implementation of the provision'smandate. See 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-1

et seq. As originally
enacted, $ 504 stood alone. It therefore made sense to allowfederal agencies to take advantage of the details included

in Title VI and the regulations promulgated to enforce

$ 601.In enacting $ 505(a)(2), Congress explicitly recognized and

approved the application of Title VI's enforcement proce-dures to $ 504. Thus, despite the Court's narrow focus on
the incorporation of the remedies provided by Title VI,$ 505(a)(2) provides that the "remedies,

procedures, and
rights" set forth in Title VI are available to an individualaggrieved by the conduct of a federal grant recipient. 29

U. S. C. $ 794a(a)(2) (emphasis added). As the Senate Report explained:

"It is the committee's understanding that the regula-tions promulgated by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare with respect to procedures, remedies,
and rights under section 504 conform with those promul-gated under title VI. Thus, this amendment codifies

existing practice as a specific statutory requirement."S. Rep. No. 95-890, at 19.

Viewed in this context, the reference in $ 505(a)(2) to "Federal provider[s]" that the Court finds so puzzling is easily
understood: The compliance mechanisms defined in Title VIinclude remedies, procedures, and rights applicable to the

providers of federal financial assistance as well as to the re-cipients of such assistance. See 29 U. S. C. $ 2000d-1

et seq.;
see, e. g., 34 CFR $$ 100.6-100.10 (1995) and Part 101 (Department of Education regulations implementing Title VI);
45 CFR $$ 80.6-80.10 (1995) and Part 81 (same for Department of Health and Human Services); id., $$ 611.6-611.10
(same for National Science Foundation).

of $ 501's prohibition on handicap discrimination in federal

employment, has a similar history.11 The provision was intended to "aid in attaining" the goals of $ 501 "by providing
for individuals aggrieved on the basis of their handicap the
same rights, procedures, and remedies provided [to] individuals aggrieved on the basis of race, creed, color, or national
origin." S. Rep. No. 95-890, at 18-19. Like $ 504, $ 501 is
not accompanied by any provisions concerning implementation. Section 505(a)(1) directs the executive to look to Title
VII for appropriate "remedies, procedures, and rights." 29
U. S. C. $ 794a(a)(1) (emphasis added).

Unlike $ 501 and the clause of $ 504 relating to recipients
of federal financial assistance, the prohibition on handicap
discrimination in programs or activities conducted by federal
Executive agencies had no simple statutory analogue. The
Court opines that if "Congress [had] wished to make Title
VI remedies available broadly for all $ 504(a) violations, it
could easily have used language in $ 505(a)(2) that is as
sweeping as the `any complaint' language contained in

$ 505(a)(1)." Ante, at 193. I agree. Congress did not so
intend, however, because, in the words of the United States,
"[i]t would have been odd for Congress to have provided that
Title VI remedies applied in Section 504 cases involving discrimination by executive agencies because Title VI [unlike

$ 504] does not prohibit discrimination in programs or activi11 Section 505(a)(1) provides: "The remedies, procedures, and rights set
forth in section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-16),
including the application of sections 706(f) through 706(k) (42 U. S. C.

$ 2000e-5(f) through (k)), shall be available, with respect to any complaint
under section 501 of this Act, to any employee or applicant for employment
aggrieved by the final disposition of such complaint, or by the failure to
take final action on such complaint. In fashioning an equitable or affirmative action remedy under such section, a court may take into account the
reasonableness of the cost of any necessary work place accommodation,
and the availability of alternatives therefor or other appropriate relief
in order to achieve an equitable and appropriate remedy." 29 U. S. C.

ties conducted by executive agencies," Brief for Respondents16, n. 8.

The oddity extends beyond the nomenclature used to de-scribe $ 504 defendants. There are at least two substantive
differences between federal Executive agencies and federal
grantees as defendants under the provision. First, Title VIprovides remedies that are appropriate against recipients of

federal financial assistance, such as the withdrawal of fund-ing for continuing violations, see 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-1, but
that make no sense if applied against an agency defendant.Second, some violations that an agency might commit concern discrimination more closely analogous to statutory provisions outside of Title VI. Thus, the standard enforcement
procedures adopted for alleged violations of $ 504 involving
employment discrimination by federal agencies require the
agency to follow $ 501 enforcement procedures. See, e. g., 7
CFR $ 15e.170(b) (1995) (Department of Agriculture regulations implementing $ 504's mandate to federal agencies); 15
CFR $ 8c.70 (1995) (same for Department of Commerce); 45
CFR $ 85.61 (1995) (same for Department of Health and
Human Services).

Viewed in its historical context, $ 505(a)(2) simply has
no application to violations of $ 504 committed by federal
agencies acting in a nonfunding capacity. Section 505(a)(2)
delineates the remedies, procedures, and rights available to
persons aggrieved by the conduct of federal grantees and
federal funding agencies. It is silent on the remedies, procedures and rights available for transgressions of $ 504 by
federal Executive agencies acting in a nonfunding capacity.
The relief to which petitioner is entitled is rooted in $ 504
itself.

In my opinion, $ 504 is amply sufficient to meet petitioner's
needs. By failing to dictate explicitly the remedies available against federal agencies, Congress left in place the remedies that accompany $ 504's implied cause of action. As
Congress understood in both 1973 and 1978, these remedies

518US1$76I 05-18-99 21:03:36 PAGES OPINPGT
210 LANE v. PENA

Stevens, J., dissenting
include monetary damages.12 Thus, as of 1978, the Rehabili-tation Act provided the relief sought by petitioner in this

case.Under the Court's current jurisprudence, however, $ 504
apparently must be read in a vacuum. Since the advent of
United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30 (1992), theCourt not only requires the traditional clear statement of

a waiver of sovereign immunity but steadfastly refuses toconsider the legislative history of a statute, no matter how
opaque the statutory language or crystalline the history.13I shall not review my objections to that holding here. See
id., at 39-46 (dissenting opinion). Suffice it to say that Con-gress had no reason to suspect in 1978 that 14 years later
this Court would adopt (and apply retroactively) a radicallynew and unforgiving approach to waivers of sovereign
immunity.

III

Not surprisingly, given its lack of fidelity to the statutorytext and history, the Court's reasoning leads to two implausible conclusions. To credit the Court's analysis, one must believe that Congress intended a damages remedy against afederal Executive agency acting indirectly in the provision

12 Aware that procedures were also needed, Congress added language in

$ 504 directing federal agencies to promulgate appropriate procedures.
29 U. S. C. $ 794(a) ("The head of each such agency shall promulgate such
regulations as may be necessary to carry out the amendments to this section made by the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and Developmental Disabilities Act of 1978").

13 The Court distinguishes Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools,

503 U. S. 60 (1992), on the ground that Franklin involved a nonfederal
defendant whereas this case concerns a federal defendant. Ante, at 196-
197. This argument cannot be reconciled with the reasoning of our opinion. Franklin relied on cases in which pecuniary awards against the
United States had been upheld. See 503 U. S., at 67 (citing Kendall v.
United States ex rel. Stokes, 12 Pet. 524 (1838), and Dooley v. United
States, 182 U. S. 222 (1901)). That being so, there is no basis for restricting application of the rule to the facts of that case.

of funding to nonfederal entities, but not against an agency
acting directly in the conduct of its own programs and activities.14 Surely such an unexpected result would have merited comment in a committee report or on the floor of the
House or Senate. Yet there is not a scintilla of evidence in
the purpose or legislative history of the Rehabilitation Act or
its amendments supporting this interpretation of the statute.

In addition, the majority's holding necessarily presumes
that Congress intended to impose harsher remedies on the
States (which come under the $ 504 provision prohibiting
handicap discrimination by federal grantees) than on federal
agencies for comparable misconduct. Given the special respect owed to the States--a respect that provided the ratio
decidendi for our decision in Atascadero State Hospital v.
Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242 (1985)--this suggestion is wholly
unconvincing. And once again, the legislative history of the
Rehabilitation Act contains no mention of such an intent and
no hint of a policy justification for this distinction.

The Court's strict approach to statutory waivers of sovereign immunity leads it to concentrate so carefully on textual
details that it has lost sight of the primary purpose of judicial
construction of Acts of Congress. We appropriately rely on
canons of construction as tie breakers to help us discern Congress' intent when its message is not entirely clear. The
presumption against waivers of sovereign immunity serves
that neutral purpose in doubtful cases. A rule that refuses
to honor such a waiver because it could have been expressed
with even greater clarity, or a rule that refuses to accept
guidance from relevant and reliable legislative history, does
not facilitate--indeed, actually obstructs--the neutral performance of the Court's task of carrying out the will of
Congress.

14 Even under the majority's interpretation, "Federal provider" must
refer exclusively to Executive agencies. Otherwise $ 505(a)(2) would create remedies against entities that may not be held liable under $ 504.

Stevens, J., dissenting
The prompt congressional reaction to our decision in Atas-cadero illustrates the lack of wisdom of the Court's rigid approach to waivers of sovereign immunity.15 It was true inthat case, as it is in this, that Congress could have drafted a
clearer statement of its intent. Our task, however, is not toeducate busy legislators in the niceties and details of scholarly draftsmanship, but rather to do our best to determinewhat message they intended to convey. When judge-made
rules require Congress to use its valuable time enacting andreenacting provisions whose original intent was clear to all
but the most skeptical and hostile reader, those rules shouldbe discarded.

I respectfully dissent.

to override the decision in 1986. See Rehabilitation Act Amendments of
1986, 100 Stat. 1845, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d-7; see also ante, at 198. In recent
years Congress has enacted numerous pieces of legislation designed to
override statutory opinions of this Court. See Landgraf v. USI Film
Products, 511 U. S. 244, 250-251 (1994) (listing eight decisions legislatively
overruled by the Civil Rights Act of 1991). Additional examples are cited

UNITED STATES v. REORGANIZED CF&IFABRICATORS OF UTAH, INC.,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 95-325. Argued March 25, 1996--Decided June 20, 1996
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 obligated CF&I

Steel Corporation and its subsidiaries (CF&I) to make certain annual
funding contributions to pension plans they sponsored. The required
contribution for the 1989 plan year totaled some $12.4 million, but
CF&I failed to make the payment and petitioned the Bankruptcy Court
for Chapter 11 reorganization. The Government filed, inter alia, a
proof of claim for tax liability arising under $ 4971(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code, 26 U. S. C. $ 4971(a), which imposes a 10 percent "tax"
(of $1.24 million here) on any "accumulated funding deficiency" of plans
such as CF&I's. The court allowed the claim but rejected the Government's argument that the claim was entitled to seventh priority as an
"excise tax" under $ 507(a)(7)(E) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U. S. C.

$ 507(a)(7)(E), finding instead that $ 4971 created a penalty that was not
in compensation for pecuniary loss. The Bankruptcy Court also subordinated the $ 4971 claim to those of all other general unsecured creditors, on the supposed authority of the Bankruptcy Code's provision for
equitable subordination, 11 U. S. C. $ 510(c), and later approved a reorganization plan for CF&I giving lowest priority (and no money) to claims
for noncompensatory penalties. The District Court and the Tenth Circuit affirmed.

Held:

1. The "tax" under $ 4971(a) was not entitled to seventh priority as
an "excise tax" under $ 507(a)(7)(E), but instead is, for bankruptcy
purposes, a penalty to be dealt with as an ordinary, unsecured claim.
Pp. 218-226.

(a) Here and there in the Bankruptcy Code Congress has referred
to the Internal Revenue Code or other federal statutes to define or
explain particular terms. It is significant that Congress included no
such reference in $ 507(a)(7)(E), even though the Bankruptcy Code provides no definition of "excise," "tax," or "excise tax." This absence of
any explicit connection between $$ 507(a)(7)(E) and 4971 is all the more
revealing in light of this Court's history of interpretive practice in determining whether a "tax" so called in the statute creating it is also a "tax"
for the purposes of the bankruptcy laws. Pp. 219-220.

Syllabus

(b) That history reveals that characterizations in the Internal Revenue Code are not dispositive in the bankruptcy context. In every case
in which the Court considered whether a particular exaction called a
"tax" in the statute creating it was a tax for bankruptcy purposes, the
Court looked behind the label and rested its answer directly on the
operation of the provision. See, e. g., United States v. New York, 315
U. S. 510, 514-517. Congress has given no statutory indication that it
intended a different interpretive method for reading terms used in the
Bankruptcy Act of 1978, see Midlantic Nat. Bank v. New Jersey Dept.
of Environmental Protection, 474 U. S. 494, 501, and the Bankruptcy
Code's specific references to the Internal Revenue Code indicates that
no general cross-identity was intended. The Government suggests that
the plain texts of $$ 4971 and 507(a)(7)(E) resolve this case, but this
approach is inconsistent with this Court's cases, which refused to rely
on statutory terminology, and is unavailing on its own terms, because
the Government disavows any suggestion that the use of the words "Excise Taxes" in the title of the chapter covering $ 4971 or the word "tax"
in $ 4971(a) is dispositive as to whether $ 4971(a) is a tax for purposes of

$ 507(a)(7)(E). The Government also seeks to rely on a statement from
the legislative history that all taxes "generally considered or expressly
treated as excises are covered by" $ 507(a)(7)(E), but $ 4971 does not call
its exaction an excise tax, and the suggestion that taxes treated as excises are "excise tax[es]" begs the question whether the exaction is a tax
to begin with. There is no basis, therefore, for avoiding the functional
examination that the Court ordinarily employs. Pp. 220-224.

(c) The Court's cases in this area look to whether the purpose of an
exaction is support of the government or punishment for an unlawful
act. If the concept of a penalty means anything, it means punishment
for an unlawful act or omission, and that is what this exaction is. The

$ 4971 exaction is imposed for violating a separate federal statute requiring the funding of pension plans, and thus has an obviously penal
character. Pp. 224-225.

(d) The legislative history reflects the statute's punitive character.
Pp. 225-226.

2. The subordination of the Government's $ 4971 claim to those of the
other general unsecured creditors pursuant to $ 510(c) was error. Categorical reordering of priorities that takes place at the legislative level of
consideration is beyond the scope of judicial authority to order equitable
subordination under $ 510(c). Pp. 226-229.

gorical rule placing $ 4971 claims at a lower priority thanunsecured claims generally. We hold that $ 4971(a) does not

create an excise tax within the meaning of $ 507(a)(7)(E), butthat categorical subordination of the Government's claim to
those of other unsecured creditors was error.

I
The CF&I Steel Corporation and its nine subsidiaries(CF&I) sponsored two pension plans, with the consequence

that CF&I was obligated by the Employee Retirement In-come Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat. 935, 29 U. S. C.

$ 1001 et seq., to make certain annual minimum funding con-tributions to the plans based on the value of the benefits
earned by its employees. See $ 1082; 26 U. S. C. $ 412. Theannual payments were due each September 15th for the preceding plan year, see 26 CFR $ 11.412(c)-12(b) (1995), and onSeptember 15, 1990, CF&I was required to pay a total of
some $12.4 million for the year ending December 31, 1989.The day passed without any such payment, and on November
7, 1990, CF&I petitioned the United States BankruptcyCourt for the District of Utah for relief under Chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code, in an attempt at financial reorganiza-tion prompted in large part by the company's inability to
fund the pension plans. In re CF&I Fabricators of Utah,Inc., 148 B. R. 332, 334 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Utah 1992).

In 1991, the IRS filed several proofs of claim for tax liabili-ties, one of which arose under 26 U. S. C. $ 4971(a), imposing
a 10 percent "tax" (of $1.24 million here) on any "accumu-lated funding deficiency" of certain pension plans.

2 The Government also filed a claim under $ 4971(b), which imposes an
exaction of 100 percent of the accumulated funding deficiency if the deficiency is not corrected before the notice of deficiency under $ 4971(a) is
mailed or the exaction under $ 4971(a) is assessed. For the plan year ending December 31, 1989, the claimed tax liability under $ 4971(b) was thus
$12.4 million. In addition, the Government filed a claim for an accumulated funding deficiency for the plan year ending December 31, 1990, in
the approximate amount of $25.6 million ($12.4 million for 1989 plus an

Opinion of the Court
Government sought priority for the claim, either as an "excise tax" within the meaning of 11 U. S. C. $ 507(a)(7)(E)
(1988 ed.), or as a tax penalty in compensation for pecuniary
loss under $ 507(a)(7)(G). CF&I disputed each alternative,
and by separate adversary complaint asked the Bankruptcy
Court to subordinate the $ 4971 claim to those of general
unsecured creditors.

The Bankruptcy Court allowed the Government's claim
under $ 4971(a) but denied it any priority under $ 507(a)(7),
finding the liability neither an "excise tax" under

$ 507(a)(7)(E) nor a tax penalty in compensation for actual
pecuniary loss under $ 507(a)(7)(G). Instead, the court read

$ 4971 as creating a noncompensatory penalty, 148 B. R., at
340, and by subsequent order subordinated the claim to those
of all other general unsecured creditors, on the supposed
authority of the Bankruptcy Code's provision for equitable
subordination, 11 U. S. C. $ 510(c).

The Government appealed to the District Court for the
District of Utah, pressing its excise tax theory and objecting to equitable subordination as improper in the absence of
Government misconduct. While that appeal was pending,
CF&I presented the Bankruptcy Court with a reorganization plan that put the $ 4971 claim in what the plan called
Class 13, a special category giving lowest priority (and no
money) to claims for nonpecuniary loss penalties; but it also
provided that, if the court found subordination behind general unsecured claims to be inappropriate, the $ 4971 claim
would be ranked with them in what the reorganization plan

additional deficiency of $13.2 million for 1990); the liability claimed under

$ 4971(a) for 1990 was therefore $2.56 million, and under $ 4971(b) the full
$25.6 million. The Bankruptcy Court disallowed all of these additional
claims (for reasons not pertinent here), see In re CF&I Fabricators of
Utah, Inc., 148 B. R. 332, 341 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Utah 1992), and the Government has not sought review of its ruling. Thus, though the Government
filed four $ 4971 claims in the Bankruptcy Court, we focus on the one at
issue here, the $ 4971(a) claim for the deficiency in the 1989 plan year.

order as well, and the District Court affirmed both the denialof excise tax treatment and the subsequent subordination
to general unsecured claims. App. to Pet. for Cert. A-11.The Tenth Circuit likewise affirmed. 53 F. 3d 1155 (1995).

We granted certiorari, 516 U. S. 1005 (1995), to resolve aconflict among the Circuits over whether $ 4971(a) claims are

subordination under $ 510(c).3 We affirm on the first ques-tion but on the second vacate the judgment and remand.

Opinion of the Court
What the Government here claims to be an excise tax obliga-tion arose under 26 U. S. C. $ 4971(a), which provides that

"[f]or each taxable year of an employer who maintains a[pension] plan . . . there is hereby imposed a tax of 10
percent (5 percent in the case of a multiemployer plan)on the amount of the accumulated funding deficiency
under the plan, determined as of the end of the plan yearending with or within such taxable year."

No one denies that Congress could have included a pro-vision in the Bankruptcy Code calling a $ 4971 exaction an
excise tax (thereby affording it the priority claimed by theGovernment); the only question is whether the exaction
ought to be treated as a tax (and, if so, an excise) withoutsome such dispositive direction.

A
Here and there in the Bankruptcy Code Congress hasincluded specific directions that establish the significance

for bankruptcy law of a term used elsewhere in the federalstatutes. Some bankruptcy provisions deal specifically with
subjects as identified by terms defined outside the Bank-ruptcy Code; 11 U. S. C. $ 523(a)(13), for example, addresses
"restitution issued under title 18, United States Code," and$ 507(a)(1) refers to "any fees and charges assessed against
the estate under chapter 123 of title 28." Other bankruptcyprovisions directly adopt definitions contained in other
statutes; thus $$ 761(5), (7), and (8) adopt the CommodityExchange Act's definitions of "commodity option," "contract
market," "contract of sale," and so on. Not surprisingly,there are places where the Bankruptcy Code makes referential use of the Internal Revenue Code, as 11 U. S. C.$ 101(41)(C)(i) does in referring to "an employee pension benefit plan that is a governmental plan, as defined in section414(d) of the Internal Revenue Code," and as $ 346(g)(1)(C)
does in providing for recognition of a gain or loss "to the

Opinion of the Court

same extent that such transfer results in the recognition ofgain or loss under section 371 of the Internal Revenue Code."

It is significant, therefore, that Congress included no suchreference in $ 507(a)(7)(E), even though the Bankruptcy Code
itself provides no definition of "excise," "tax," or "excisetax." This absence of any explicit connector between

$$ 507(a)(7)(E) and 4971 is all the more revealing in light ofthe following history of interpretive practice in determining
whether a "tax" so called in the statute creating it is also a"tax" (as distinct from a debt or penalty) for the purpose of
setting the priority of a claim under the bankruptcy laws.

B
Although $ 507(a)(7), giving seventh priority to several dif-ferent kinds of taxes, was enacted as part of the Bankruptcy

Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 2590 (1978 Act), a priority provision fortaxes was nothing new. Section 64(a) of the Bankruptcy Act
of 1898 (1898 Act), which governed (as frequently amended)until 1978, gave priority to "taxes legally due and owing by
the bankrupt to the United States [or a] State, county, dis-trict, or municipality." 30 Stat. 544, 563.

4 On a number of

occasions, this Court considered whether a particular exac-tion, whether or not called a "tax" in the statute creating it,

was a tax for purposes of $ 64(a), and in every one of thosecases the Court looked behind the label placed on the exaction and rested its answer directly on the operation of theprovision using the term in question.

The earliest such cases involved state taxes and are exem-plified by City of New York v. Feiring, 313 U. S. 283 (1941).
In considering whether a New York sales tax was a "tax"entitled to priority under $ 64(a), the Court placed no weight
on the "tax" label in the New York law, and looked to the

4 This provision was modified slightly between 1898 and 1978, most notably in 1938, when it was moved to $ 64(a)(4) (and given fourth priority)
and amended to apply to "taxes legally due and owing by the bankrupt to
the United States or any State or any subdivision thereof." 52 Stat. 874.

state statute only "to ascertain whether its incidents aresuch as to constitute a tax within the meaning of $ 64." Id.,

at 285. See also New Jersey v. Anderson, 203 U. S. 483, 492(1906); New York v. Jersawit, 263 U. S. 493, 495-496 (1924).
The Court later followed the same course when a federalstatute created the exaction. In

United States v. NewYork, 315 U. S. 510 (1942), the Court considered whether

" `tax[es]' " so called in two federal statutes, id., at 512, n. 2,were entitled to priority as "taxes" under $ 64(a). In each
instance the decision turned on the actual effects of the exac-tions, id., at 514-517, with the Court citing Feiring and Anderson as authority for its enquiry. 315 U. S., at 514-516.See also

United States v. Childs, 266 U. S. 304, 309-310(1924); United States v. Sotelo, 436 U. S. 268, 275 (1978) ("We

. . . cannot agree with the Court of Appeals that the `penalty'language of Internal Revenue Code $ 6672 is dispositive of
the status of respondent's debt under Bankruptcy Act$ 17(a)(1)(e)").

Congress could, of course, have intended a different inter-pretive method for reading terms used in the Bankruptcy

Code it created in 1978. But if it had so intended we wouldexpect some statutory indication, see Midlantic Nat. Bank
v. New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protection, 474 U. S.494, 501 (1986), whereas the most obvious statutory indicator
is very much to the contrary: in the specific instances notedbefore, it would have been redundant for Congress to refer

5 As the Court stated in a different context: "Although the statute . . .
terms the money demanded as `a further sum,' and does not describe it as
a penalty, still the use of those words does not change the nature and
character of the enactment. Congress may enact that such a provision
shall not be considered as a penalty or in the nature of one, . . . and it is
the duty of the court to be governed by such statutory direction, but the
intrinsic nature of the provision remains, and, in the absence of any declaration by Congress affecting the manner in which the provision shall be
treated, courts must decide the matter in accordance with their views of
the nature of the act." Helwig v. United States, 188 U. S. 605, 612-613
(1903).

Opinion of the Court

specifically to Internal Revenue Code definitions of given
terms if such cross-identity were to be assumed or presumed,
as a matter of interpretive course.

While the Government does not directly challenge the continuing vitality of the cases in the Feiring line, it seeks to
sidestep them by arguing, first, that similarities between the
plain texts of $$ 4971 and 507(a)(7)(E) resolve this case.
This approach, however, is inconsistent with New York and
Sotelo, in each of which the Court refused to rely on the
terminology used in the relevant tax and bankruptcy provisions.6 The argument is also unavailing on its own terms,
for even if we were to accept the proposition that comparable
use of similar terms is dispositive, the Government's plain
text argument still would fail.

The word "excise" appears nowhere in $ 4971 (whereas, by
contrast, 26 U. S. C. $ 4401 explicitly states that it imposes
"an excise tax"). And although there is one reference to
"excise taxes" that applies to $ 4971 in the heading of the subtitle covering that section ("Subtitle D--Miscellaneous Excise
Taxes"), the Government disclaims any reliance on that caption. Tr. of Oral Arg. 14, 17-20; see also 26 U. S. C. $ 7806(b)
("No inference, implication, or presumption of legislative construction shall be drawn or made by reason of the location
or grouping of any particular section or provision or portion
of this title"). Furthermore, though $ 4971(a) does explicitly
refer to its exaction as a "tax," the Government disavows
any suggestion that this language is dispositive as to
whether $ 4971(a) is a tax for purposes of $ 507(a)(7)(E); while

6 Justice Thomas's suggestion that no case "has denied bankruptcy priority to a congressionally enacted tax," post, at 230, is true, but not on
point. United States v. New York, 315 U. S., at 514-517, employed the
Feiring-Anderson analysis to the exactions at issue there; the Court did
not rely on the label that Congress gave. See also United States v. Sotelo,
436 U. S., at 275; United States v. Childs, 266 U. S. 304, 309-310 (1924).
The Court's conclusion that the exactions functioned as taxes does not
change the fact that it employed a functional analysis.

Opinion of the Court

$ 4971(b) "impos[es] a tax equal to 100 percent of [the]accumulated funding deficiency to the extent not corrected,"

the Government says that this explicit language does notanswer the question whether $ 4971(b) is, in fact, a tax under

$ 507(a)(7)(E). Reply Brief for United States 13-14; Tr. ofOral Arg. 19-24. The Government's positions, then, undermine its suggestion that the statutes' texts standing togetherdemonstrate that $ 4971(a) imposes an excise tax.

The Government's second effort to avoid a New York and
Sotelo interpretive enquiry relies on a statement from thelegislative history of the 1978 Act, that "[a]ll Federal, State

or local taxes generally considered or expressly treated asexcises are covered by" $ 507(a)(7)(E). 124 Cong. Rec. 32416
(1978) (remarks of Rep. Edwards); id., at 34016 (remarks ofSen. DeConcini). But even taking this statement as authoritative, it would provide little support for the Government'sposition. Although the statement may mean that all exactions called 7 "excise taxes" should be covered by $ 507(a)(7)(E),

8 $ 4971 does not call its exaction an excise tax. And

although the section occurs in a subtitle with a headingof "Miscellaneous Excise Taxes," the Government has disclaimed reliance on the subtitle heading as authority for itsposition in this case, recognizing the provision of 26 U. S. C.

$ 7806(b) that no inference of legislative construction shouldbe drawn from the placement of a provision in the Internal
Revenue Code. See supra, at 222 and this page; Tr. of OralArg. 19. If, on the other hand, the statement in the legisla7 Assuming that an exaction would not be "generally considered" an
excise tax unless it would be reasonable to consider it such, the possible
application of this first prong of the legislators' statement of intent is
answered by the analysis of $ 4971, below.

8 It should be noted, though, that such an interpretation may prove too

much: the Government suggests that this statement from the legislative
history does not affect the rule of construction that courts will look behind
the denomination of state and local taxes, Reply Brief for United States
6, n. 4, but it is difficult to read that sentence as applying one rule for
federal taxes and another for state and local ones.

Opinion of the Court

tive history is read more literally, its apparent upshot is that,among those exactions that are taxes, the ones that are

expressly treated as excises are "excise tax[es]" withinthe meaning of $ 507(a)(7)(E). But that proposition fails, of
course, to answer the question whether the exaction is a taxto begin with.

In sum, we conclude that the 1978 Act reveals no congres-sional intent to reject generally the interpretive principle
that characterizations in the Internal Revenue Code are notdispositive in the bankruptcy context, and no specific provision that would relieve us from making a functional examina-tion of $ 4971(a). We proceed to that examination.

C
Anderson and New York applied the same test in deter-mining whether an exaction was a tax under $ 64(a), or a

penalty or debt: "a tax is a pecuniary burden laid upon indi-viduals or property for the purpose of supporting the Government." Anderson, 203 U. S., at 492; New York, 315 U. S.,at 515; accord, Feiring, 313 U. S., at 285 ("$ 64 extends to
those pecuniary burdens laid upon individuals or their prop-erty . . . for the purpose of defraying the expenses of government or of undertakings authorized by it"). Or, as theCourt noted in a somewhat different context, "[a] tax is an
enforced contribution to provide for the support of govern-ment; a penalty, as the word is here used, is an exaction
imposed by statute as punishment for an unlawful act."
United States v. La Franca, 282 U. S. 568, 572 (1931).We take La Franca's statement of the distinction to be

sufficient for the decision of this case; if the concept of pen-alty means anything, it means punishment for an unlawful
act or omission, and a punishment for an unlawful omissionis what this exaction is. Title 29 U. S. C. $ 1082 requires a
pension plan sponsor to fund potential plan liability accordingto a complex statutory formula, see also 26 U. S. C. $ 412,
and 26 U. S. C. $ 4971(a) requires employers who maintain a

Opinion of the Court
pension plan to pay the Government 10 percent of any accumulated funding deficiency. If the employer fails to correct
the deficiency before the earlier of a notice of deficiency
under $ 4971(a) or an assessment of the $ 4971(a) exaction,
the employer is obligated to pay an additional "tax" of 100
percent of the accumulated funding deficiency. $ 4971(b).9
The obviously penal character of these exactions is underscored by other provisions, including one giving the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) an entirely independent claim against the employer for "the total amount of the
unfunded benefit liabilities," 29 U. S. C. $ 1362(b)(1)(A) (a
claim which in this case the PBGC has asserted and which

is still pending, see Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v.
Reorganized CF&I Fabricators of Utah, Inc., 179 B. R. 704
(ND Utah 1994)); see also $$ 1306-1307. We are, indeed, unable to find any provision in the statutory scheme that would
cast the "tax" at issue here in anything but this punitive light.

D
The legislative history reflects the statute's punitive
character:

9 The Government contends that $ 4971(b) is more similar to a penalty
than $ 4971(a) is, because the Secretary of the Treasury can waive liability
under the former but not the latter. The suggestion is that the Secretary
can waive the imposition of the 100 percent tax, under ERISA $ 3002(b), 88
Stat. 997, or can eliminate a violation by reducing the employer's funding
requirement, see 26 U. S. C. $ 412(d); see also 29 U. S. C. $ 1083(a). But

$$ 412(d) and 1083(a) provide for waiver of the minimum funding requirements, so their application would avoid a violation of either $$ 4971(a) or
(b); there simply would be no "accumulated funding deficiency" for purposes of either $$ 4971(a) or (b). Thus the Government is incorrect in
suggesting that the Secretary has the ability to waive the exaction under

$ 4971(b) but not under $ 4971(a).

More fundamentally, even if the Secretary could waive only $ 4971(b), it
is not clear why this would make any difference, as the exaction would
still serve to reinforce a federal prohibition.

FABRICATORS OF UTAH, INC.

Opinion of the Court

"The bill also provides new and more effective penalties where employers fail to meet the funding standards.
In the past, an attempt has been made to enforce the
relatively weak funding standards existing under present law by providing for immediate vesting of the employees' rights, to the extent funded, under plans which
do not meet these standards. This procedure, however,
has proved to be defective since it does not directly penalize those responsible for the underfunding. For this
reason, the bill places the obligation for funding and the
penalty for underfunding on the person on whom it belongs--namely, the employer." H. R. Rep. No. 93-807,
p. 28 (1974).

Accord, S. Rep. No. 93-383, p. 24 (1973). The Committee
Reports also stated that, "[s]ince the employer remains liable
for the contributions necessary to meet the funding standards even after the payment of the excise taxes, it is anticipated that few, if any, employers will willfully violate these
standards." H. R. Rep. No. 93-807, supra, at 28; S. Rep. No.
93-383, supra, at 24-25.

Given the patently punitive function of $ 4971, we conclude
that $ 4971 must be treated as imposing a penalty, not authorizing a tax. Accordingly, we hold that the "tax" under

$ 4971(a) was not entitled to seventh priority as an "excise
tax" under $ 507(a)(7)(E), but instead is, for bankruptcy purposes, a penalty to be dealt with as an ordinary, unsecured
claim.

III

Hence, the next question: whether the Court of Appeals
improperly subordinated the Government's $ 4971 claim to
those of the other general unsecured creditors. Though we
have rejected the argument that the $ 4971 claim is for an
"excise tax" within the meaning of $ 507(a)(7)(E), both parties agree that the $ 4971 claim is allowable on a nonpriority

Opinion of the Court
unsecured basis.10 CF&I's reorganization plan did not lumpall unsecured claims in one nonpriority class, however, but

instead created four classes of unsecured creditors, only thefirst two of which would receive funds: Class 11 comprised
small claims ($1,500 or less) grouped together for administra-tive convenience, see 11 U. S. C. $ 1122(b); Class 12 comprised
general unsecured claims (except for those assigned to otherclasses); Class 13 covered the $ 4971 claim and some other
(much smaller) subordinated penalty claims; and Class 14,claims between the CF&I Steel Corporation and its subsidiaries (all of which were bankrupt), the net value of whichwas zero. The plan provided, nonetheless, that if a court
determined that a Class 13 claim should not be subordinated,or that the Class 13 claims should not be separately classified, the claim or claims would be placed in Class 12. Appel-lees' App. in No. 94-4034 et al., at 95-101, 137-141, 196-200.

When the Government challenged the proposal to subor-dinate its claim, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the reorganization plan, App. to Pet. for Cert. A-31, and orderedthat the $ 4971 claim be "subordinated to the claims of all
other general unsecured creditors of [CF&I] pursuant to11 U. S. C. $ 510(c)."

Id., at A-21. The District Court sub-sequently ruled that the $ 4971 claim "should be equitably

subordinated to the claims of the general creditors underSection 510(c)." Id., at A-18. In the Tenth Circuit, the
Government again contested subordination under $ 510(c),which CF&I defended, even as it sought to sustain the Bankruptcy Court's result with two new, alternative arguments:first, that 11 U. S. C. $ 1122(a), restricting a given class to
substantially similar claims, prohibited placement of the$ 4971 claim in Class 12, because of its dissimilarity to other

10 Cf. $ 57(j) of the 1898 Act, 30 Stat. 561 ("Debts owing to the United
States, a State, a county, a district, or a municipality as a penalty or forfeiture shall not be allowed, except for the amount of the pecuniary loss
sustained by the act, transaction, or proceeding out of which the penalty
or forfeiture arose").

unsecured claims; and second, that, because 11 U. S. C.$ 1129(a)(7) authorizes creditors with impaired claims (

i. e.,

must have the power to assign a claim the same priority itwould have in a Chapter 7 liquidation (in which a noncompensatory prepetition penalty claim would be subordinated,11 U. S. C. $ 726(a)(4)). The Court of Appeals addressed neither of these arguments, however, relying instead on thebroad construction given $ 510(c) in

Servs. Corp., 902 F. 2d 1246 (CA7 1990) (subordinating
a claim otherwise entitled to priority under $ 507(a)(7) to
those of general unsecured creditors), and holding specifically that "section 510(c)(1) does not require a finding of
claimant misconduct to subordinate nonpecuniary loss tax
penalty claims." 53 F. 3d, at 1159. The Court of Appeals
took note of the Bankruptcy Court's finding that "[d]eclining
to subordinate the IRS's penalty claim would harm innocent
creditors rather than punish the debtor" and concluded that
"the bankruptcy court correctly addressed the equities in
this case." Ibid.

Nothing in the opinion of the Court of Appeals (or, for
that matter, in the rulings of the Bankruptcy Court and the
District Court) addresses the arguments that the Bankruptcy Court's result was sustainable without reliance on

$ 510(c). The court never suggested that either $ 1122(a) or
the Chapter 7 liquidation provisions were relevant. We
thus necessarily review the subordination on the assumption
that the Court of Appeals placed no reliance on the possibility that the Bankruptcy Code might permit the subordination on any basis except equitable subordination under

$ 510(c).

So understood, the subordination was error. In United
States v. Noland, 517 U. S. 535 (1996), we reversed a judgment said to rely on $ 510(c) when the subordination turned

on nothing other than the very characteristic that entitledthe Government's claim to priority under $$ 507(a)(1) and

503(b)(1)(C). We held that the subordination fell beyond thescope of a court's authority under the doctrine of equitable
subordination, because categorical subordination at the same
level of generality assumed by Congress in establishing rela-tive priorities among creditors was tantamount to a legislative act and therefore was outside the scope of any leewayunder $ 510(c) for judicial development of the equitable subordination doctrine. See id., at 543. Of course it is truethat

Noland passed on the subordination from a higher priority class to the residual category of general unsecuredcreditors at the end of the line, whereas here the subordination was imposed upon a disfavored subgroup within the residual category. But the principle of Noland has nothing to
do with transfer between classes, as distinct from ranking
within one of them. The principle is simply that categorical
reordering of priorities that takes place at the legislative
level of consideration is beyond the scope of judicial authority to order equitable subordination under $ 510(c). The
order in this case was as much a violation of that principle
as Noland's order was.

Without passing on the merits of CF&I's arguments that
the $ 4971 claim is not similar to the other unsecured claims
and that courts dealing with Chapter 11 plans should be
guided by Chapter 7 provisions, we vacate the judgment of
the Court of Appeals, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Thomas, concurring in part and dissenting in
part.

I agree with the majority that the Bankruptcy Court improperly relied on 11 U. S. C. $ 510(c) to subordinate the

nation that assessments under 26 U. S. C. $ 4971(a) are not"excise taxes" within the meaning of 11 U. S. C. $ 507(a)(7)(E)

(1988 ed.). I would hold that every congressionally enactedtax that is generally considered an excise tax is entitled to
bankruptcy priority under $ 507(a)(7)(E).Section 507(a)(7)(E) creates a bankruptcy priority for excise taxes. Congress, in enacting $ 4971, purported to enacta tax, see 26 U. S. C. $ 4971(a) ("[T]here is hereby imposed a
tax . . ."), and the tax it enacted is properly considered anexcise tax. See

Commissioner v. Keystone Consol. Indus-tries, Inc., 508 U. S. 152, 161 (1993) (stating, in dicta, that

$ 4971 imposes an excise tax). It is true that New Jersey v.
Anderson, 203 U. S. 483 (1906), and its progeny held thatwhether a state assessment is entitled to bankruptcy priority as a tax is a federal question. See id., at 492; City ofNew York v. Feiring, 313 U. S. 283, 285 (1941). It is not appropriate, however, for federal courts to perform a similarinquiry into valid taxes passed by Congress, and the majority cites no case in which this Court has denied bankruptcypriority to a congressionally enacted tax. I respectfully
dissent.

BROWN et al. v. PRO FOOTBALL, INC., dbaWASHINGTON REDSKINS,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 95-388. Argued March 27, 1996--Decided June 20, 1996
After their collective-bargaining agreement expired, the National Football

League (NFL), a group of football clubs, and the NFL Players Association, a labor union, began to negotiate a new contract. The NFL presented a plan that would permit each club to establish a "developmental
squad" of substitute players, each of whom would be paid the same
$1,000 weekly salary. The union disagreed, insisting that individual
squad members should be free to negotiate their own salaries. When
negotiations reached an impasse, the NFL unilaterally implemented the
plan. A number of squad players brought this antitrust suit, claiming
that the employers' agreement to pay them $1,000 per week restrained
trade in violation of the Sherman Act. The District Court entered
judgment for the players on a jury treble-damages award, but the Court
of Appeals reversed, holding that the owners were immune from antitrust liability under the federal labor laws.

Held: Federal labor laws shield from antitrust attack an agreement among

several employers bargaining together to implement after impasse the
terms of their last best good-faith wage offer. Pp. 235-250.

(a) This Court has previously found in the labor laws an implicit,
"nonstatutory" antitrust exemption that applies where needed to make
the collective-bargaining process work. See, e. g., Connell Constr. Co.
v. Plumbers, 421 U. S. 616, 622. The practice here at issue--the postimpasse imposition of a proposed employment term concerning a mandatory subject of bargaining--is unobjectionable as a matter of labor law
and policy, and, indeed, plays a significant role in the multiemployer
collective-bargaining process that itself comprises an important part of
the Nation's industrial relations system. Subjecting it to antitrust law
would threaten to introduce instability and uncertainty into the
collective-bargaining process, for antitrust often forbids or discourages
the kinds of joint discussions and behavior that collective bargaining
invites or requires. Moreover, if antitrust courts tried to evaluate particular kinds of employer understandings, there would be created a web
of detailed rules spun by many different nonexpert antitrust judges and
juries, not a set of labor rules enforced by a single expert body, the

Syllabus
National Labor Relations Board, to which the labor laws give primary
responsibility for policing collective bargaining. Thus, the implicit
exemption applies in this case. Pp. 235-242.

(b) Petitioners' claim that the exemption applies only to labormanagement agreements is rejected, since it is based on inapposite
authority, and an exemption limited by petitioners' labor-managementconsent principle could not work. Pp. 243-244.

(c) Also rejected is the Government's argument that the exemption
should terminate at the point of impasse. Its rationale, that employers
are thereafter free as a matter of labor law to negotiate individual arrangements on an interim basis with the union, is not completely accurate. More importantly, the simple "impasse" line would not solve the
basic problem that labor law permits employers, after impasse, to engage in considerable joint behavior, while uniform employer conduct--
at least when accompanied by discussion--invites antitrust attack.
Pp. 244-247.

(d) Petitioners' alternative rule, which would exempt from antitrust's
reach postimpasse agreements about bargaining "tactics," but not those
about substantive "terms," is unsatisfactory because it would require
antitrust courts, insulated from the bargaining process, to delve into the
amorphous subject of employers' subjective motives in order to determine whether the exemption applied. Pp. 247-248.

(e) Petitioners' arguments relating to general "backdrop" statutes
and the "special" nature of professional sports are also rejected.
Pp. 248-250.

(f) The antitrust exemption applies to the employer conduct at issue
here, which took place during and immediately after a collectivebargaining negotiation; grew out of, and was a directly related to, the
lawful operation of the bargaining process; involved a matter that the
parties were required to negotiate collectively; and concerned only the
parties to the collective-bargaining relationship. The Court's holding is
not intended to insulate from antitrust review every joint imposition of
terms by employers, for an employer agreement could be sufficiently
distant in time and in circumstances from the bargaining process that a
rule permitting antitrust intervention would not significantly interfere
with that process. The Court need not decide in this case whether, or
where, to draw the line, particularly since it does not have the detailed
views of the Board on the matter. P. 250.

234 BROWN v. PRO FOOTBALL, INC.

Opinion of the Court
football players brought this antitrust suit against footballclub owners. The club owners had bargained with the players' union over a wage issue until they reached impasse.The owners then had agreed among themselves (but not with
the union) to implement the terms of their own last bestbargaining offer. The question before us is whether federal
labor laws shield such an agreement from antitrust attack.We believe that they do. This Court has previously found
in the labor laws an implicit antitrust exemption that applieswhere needed to make the collective-bargaining process
work. Like the Court of Appeals, we conclude that thisneed makes the exemption applicable in this case.

I
We can state the relevant facts briefly. In 1987, acollective-bargaining agreement between the National Football League (NFL or League), a group of football clubs, andthe NFL Players Association, a labor union, expired. The
NFL and the Players Association began to negotiate a newcontract. In March 1989, during the negotiations, the NFL
adopted Resolution G-2, a plan that would permit each clubto establish a "developmental squad" of up to six rookie or
"first-year" players who, as free agents, had failed to securea position on a regular player roster. See App. 42. Squad
members would play in practice games and sometimes inregular games as substitutes for injured players. Resolution G-2 provided that the club owners would pay all squadmembers the same weekly salary.

The next month, April, the NFL presented the develop-mental squad plan to the Players Association. The NFL
proposed a squad player salary of $1,000 per week. ThePlayers Association disagreed. It insisted that the club
owners give developmental squad players benefits and pro-tections similar to those provided regular players, and that
they leave individual squad members free to negotiate theirown salaries.

235Cite as: 518 U. S. 231 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
Two months later, in June, negotiations on the issue of de-velopmental squad salaries reached an impasse. The NFL

then unilaterally implemented the developmental squad pro-gram by distributing to the clubs a uniform contract that
embodied the terms of Resolution G-2 and the $1,000 pro-posed weekly salary. The League advised club owners that
paying developmental squad players more or less than $1,000per week would result in disciplinary action, including the
loss of draft choices.In May 1990, 235 developmental squad players brought
this antitrust suit against the League and its member clubs.The players claimed that their employers' agreement to pay
them a $1,000 weekly salary violated the Sherman Act. See15 U. S. C. $ 1 (forbidding agreements in restraint of trade).
The Federal District Court denied the employers' claim ofexemption from the antitrust laws; it permitted the case to
reach the jury; and it subsequently entered judgment on ajury treble-damages award that exceeded $30 million. The
NFL and its member clubs appealed.The Court of Appeals (by a split 2-to-1 vote) reversed.
The majority interpreted the labor laws as "waiv[ing] anti-trust liability for restraints on competition imposed through
the collective-bargaining process, so long as such restraintsoperate primarily in a labor market characterized by collective bargaining." 50 F. 3d 1041, 1056 (CADC 1995). Thecourt held, consequently, that the club owners were immune
from antitrust liability. We granted certiorari to reviewthat determination. Although we do not interpret the exemption as broadly as did the Appeals Court, we nonethelessfind the exemption applicable, and we affirm that court's immunity conclusion. II

The immunity before us rests upon what this Court hascalled the "nonstatutory" labor exemption from the antitrust
laws. Connell Constr. Co. v. Plumbers, 421 U. S. 616, 622(1975); see also Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., 381 U. S. 676

Opinion of the Court
(1965); Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U. S. 657 (1965).The Court has implied this exemption from federal labor

statutes, which set forth a national labor policy favoring freeand private collective bargaining, see 29 U. S. C. $ 151;

Teamsters v. Oliver, 358 U. S. 283, 295 (1959); which require goodfaith bargaining over wages, hours, and working conditions,see 29 U. S. C. $$ 158(a)(5), 158(d);

San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359
U. S. 236, 242-245 (1959).

This implicit exemption reflects both history and logic.
As a matter of history, Congress intended the labor statutes
(from which the Court has implied the exemption) in part to
adopt the views of dissenting Justices in Duplex Printing
Press Co. v. Deering, 254 U. S. 443 (1921), which Justices had
urged the Court to interpret broadly a different explicit
"statutory" labor exemption that Congress earlier (in 1914)
had written directly into the antitrust laws. Id., at 483-488
(Brandeis, J., joined by Holmes and Clarke, JJ., dissenting)
(interpreting $ 20 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 738, 29 U. S. C.

$ 52); see also United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U. S. 219, 230-
236 (1941) (discussing congressional reaction to Duplex). In
the 1930's, when it subsequently enacted the labor statutes,
Congress, as in 1914, hoped to prevent judicial use of antitrust law to resolve labor disputes--a kind of dispute normally inappropriate for antitrust law resolution. See Jewel
Tea, supra, at 700-709 (opinion of Goldberg, J.); Marine
Cooks v. Panama S. S. Co., 362 U. S. 365, 370, n. 7 (1960); A.
Cox, Law and the National Labor Policy 3-8 (1960); cf. Duplex, supra, at 485 (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (explicit "statutory" labor exemption reflected view that "Congress, not the
judges, was the body which should declare what public policy
in regard to the industrial struggle demands"). The implicit
("nonstatutory") exemption interprets the labor statutes in

237Cite as: 518 U. S. 231 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
accordance with this intent, namely, as limiting an antitrustcourt's authority to determine, in the area of industrial conflict, what is or is not a "reasonable" practice. It therebysubstitutes legislative and administrative labor-related determinations for judicial antitrust-related determinations as
to the appropriate legal limits of industrial conflict. See
Jewel Tea, supra, at 709-710.

As a matter of logic, it would be difficult, if not impossible,to require groups of employers and employees to bargain together, but at the same time to forbid them to make amongthemselves or with each other

any of the competitionrestricting agreements potentially necessary to make the
process work or its results mutually acceptable. Thus, the
implicit exemption recognizes that, to give effect to federal
labor laws and policies and to allow meaningful collective
bargaining to take place, some restraints on competition imposed through the bargaining process must be shielded from
antitrust sanctions. See Connell, supra, at 622 (federal
labor law's "goals" could "never" be achieved if ordinary anticompetitive effects of collective bargaining were held to violate the antitrust laws); Jewel Tea, supra, at 711 (national
labor law scheme would be "virtually destroyed" by the routine imposition of antitrust penalties upon parties engaged
in collective bargaining); Pennington, supra, at 665 (implicit
exemption necessary to harmonize Sherman Act with "national policy . . . of promoting `the peaceful settlement of
industrial disputes by subjecting labor-management controversies to the mediatory influence of negotiation' ") (quoting
Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. NLRB, 379 U. S. 203,
211 (1964)).

The petitioners and their supporters concede, as they
must, the legal existence of the exemption we have described. They also concede that, where its application is
necessary to make the statutorily authorized collectivebargaining process work as Congress intended, the exemption must apply both to employers and to employees.

v. Actors' Equity Assn., 451 U. S. 704, 717, n. 20 (1981) (explicit "statutory" exemption applies only to "bona fide labor
organization[s]"). Nor does the dissent take issue with
these basic principles. See post, at 253-254. Consequently,
the question before us is one of determining the exemption's
scope: Does it apply to an agreement among several employers bargaining together to implement after impasse the
terms of their last best good-faith wage offer? We assume
that such conduct, as practiced in this case, is unobjectionable as a matter of labor law and policy. On that assumption, we conclude that the exemption applies.

Labor law itself regulates directly, and considerably, the
kind of behavior here at issue--the postimpasse imposition
of a proposed employment term concerning a mandatory subject of bargaining. Both the Board and the courts have held
that, after impasse, labor law permits employers unilaterally
to implement changes in pre-existing conditions, but only
insofar as the new terms meet carefully circumscribed conditions. For example, the new terms must be "reasonably
comprehended" within the employer's preimpasse proposals
(typically the last rejected proposals), lest by imposing more
or less favorable terms, the employer unfairly undermined
the union's status. Storer Communica tions, Inc., 294

any unfair labor practice, such as an employer's failure to
have bargained in good faith. See Akron Novelty Mfg. Co.,
224 N. L. R. B. 998, 1002 (1976) (where employer has not
bargained in good faith, it may not implement a term of employment); 1 P. Hardin, The Developing Labor Law 697 (3d
ed. 1992) (same). These regulations reflect the fact that impasse and an accompanying implementation of proposals constitute an integral part of the bargaining process. See Bonanno Linen Serv., Inc., 243 N. L. R. B. 1093, 1094 (1979)
(describing use of impasse as a bargaining tactic), enf 'd, 630

U. S. 955 (1992).

Although the case law we have cited focuses upon bargaining by a single employer, no one here has argued that labor
law does, or should, treat multiemployer bargaining differently in this respect. Indeed, Board and court decisions
suggest that the joint implementation of proposed terms
after impasse is a familiar practice in the context of multiemployer bargaining. See, e. g., El Cerrito Mill & Lumber Co.,

Multiemployer bargaining itself is a well-established, important, pervasive method of collective bargaining, offering
advantages to both management and labor. See Appendix,
infra, p. 251 (multiemployer bargaining accounts for more
than 40% of major collective-bargaining agreements, and is
used in such industries as construction, transportation, retail
trade, clothing manufacture, and real estate, as well as professional sports); NLRB v. Truck Drivers, 353 U. S. 87, 95
(1957) (Buffalo Linen) (Congress saw multiemployer bargaining as "a vital factor in the effectuation of the national
policy of promoting labor peace through strengthened collective bargaining"); Charles D. Bonanno Linen Service, Inc.
v. NLRB, 454 U. S. 404, 409, n. 3 (1982) (Bonanno Linen)
(multiemployer bargaining benefits both management and
labor, by saving bargaining resources, by encouraging development of industry-wide worker benefits programs that
smaller employers could not otherwise afford, and by inhibiting employer competition at the workers' expense); Brief for
Respondent NLRB in Bonanno Linen, O. T. 1981, No. 80-
931, p. 10, n. 7 (same); General Subcommittee on Labor,

Association Bargaining and its Impact on the Collective Bargaining Process, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 10-19, 32-33 (Comm.
Print 1964) (same); see also C. Bonnett, Employers' Associations in the United States: A Study of Typical Associations
(1922) (history). The upshot is that the practice at issue
here plays a significant role in a collective-bargaining process
that itself constitutes an important part of the Nation's industrial relations system.

In these circumstances, to subject the practice to antitrust

Opinion of the Court
wages, hours, and working conditions is to proceed--the
very result that the implicit labor exemption seeks to avoid.
And it is to place in jeopardy some of the potentially beneficial labor-related effects that multiemployer bargaining can
achieve. That is because unlike labor law, which sometimes
welcomes anticompetitive agreements conducive to industrial harmony, antitrust law forbids all agreements among
competitors (such as competing employers) that unreasonably lessen competition among or between them in virtually
any respect whatsoever. See, e. g., Paramount Famous
Lasky Corp. v. United States, 282 U. S. 30 (1930) (agreement
to insert arbitration provisions in motion picture licensing
contracts). Antitrust law also sometimes permits judges or
juries to premise antitrust liability upon little more than uniform behavior among competitors, preceded by conversations implying that later uniformity might prove desirable,
see, e. g., United States v. General Motors Corp., 384 U. S.
127, 142-143 (1966); United States v. Foley, 598 F. 2d 1323,
1331-1332 (CA4 1979), cert. denied, 444 U. S. 1043 (1980), or
accompanied by other conduct that in context suggests that
each competitor failed to make an independent decision, see,
e. g., American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U. S. 781,
809-810 (1946); United States v. Masonite Corp., 316 U. S.
265, 275 (1942); Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, 306
U. S. 208, 226-227 (1939). See generally 6 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law |||| 1416-1427 (1986); Turner, The Definition of
Agreement Under the Sherman Act: Conscious Parallelism
and Refusals to Deal, 75 Harv. L. Rev. 655 (1962).

If the antitrust laws apply, what are employers to do once
impasse is reached? If all impose terms similar to their last
joint offer, they invite an antitrust action premised upon
identical behavior (along with prior or accompanying conversations) as tending to show a common understanding or
agreement. If any, or all, of them individually impose terms
that differ significantly from that offer, they invite an unfair

Opinion of the Court
labor practice charge. Indeed, how can employers safely
discuss their offers together even before a bargaining impasse occurs? A preimpasse discussion about, say, the practical advantages or disadvantages of a particular proposal
invites a later antitrust claim that they agreed to limit the
kinds of action each would later take should an impasse
occur. The same is true of postimpasse discussions aimed
at renewed negotiations with the union. Nor would adherence to the terms of an expired collective-bargaining agreement eliminate a potentially plausible antitrust claim charging that they had "conspired" or tacitly "agreed" to do so,
particularly if maintaining the status quo were not in the
immediate economic self-interest of some. Cf. Interstate
Circuit, supra, at 222-223; 6 Areeda, supra, || 1425. All this
is to say that to permit antitrust liability here threatens to
introduce instability and uncertainty into the collectivebargaining process, for antitrust law often forbids or discourages the kinds of joint discussions and behavior that the
collective-bargaining process invites or requires.

We do not see any obvious answer to this problem. We
recognize, as the Government suggests, that, in principle,
antitrust courts might themselves try to evaluate particular
kinds of employer understandings, finding them "reasonable"
(hence lawful) where justified by collective-bargaining necessity. But any such evaluation means a web of detailed rules
spun by many different nonexpert antitrust judges and
juries, not a set of labor rules enforced by a single expert
administrative body, namely the Board. The labor laws give
the Board, not antitrust courts, primary responsibility for
policing the collective-bargaining process. And one of their
objectives was to take from antitrust courts the authority
to determine, through application of the antitrust laws, what
is socially or economically desirable collective-bargaining
policy. See supra, at 236-237; see also Jewel Tea, 381 U. S.,
at 716-719 (opinion of Goldberg, J.).

Opinion of the Court

III
Both petitioners and their supporters advance several sug-gestions for drawing the exemption boundary line short of

this case. We shall explain why we find them unsatisfactory.

A
Petitioners claim that the implicit exemption applies onlyto labor-management agreements--a limitation that they deduce from case law language, see, e. g., Connell, 421 U. S., at622 (exemption for "some union-employer

agreements") (em-phasis added), and from a proposed principle--that the exemption must rest upon labor-management consent. Thelanguage, however, reflects only the fact that the cases
previously before the Court involved collective-bargainingagreements, see id., at 619-620; Pennington, 381 U. S., at
660; Jewel Tea, supra, at 679-680; the language does notreflect the exemption's rationale, see 50 F. 3d, at 1050.

Nor do we see how an exemption limited by petitioners'principle of labor-management consent could work. One
cannot mean the principle literally--that the exemptionapplies only to understandings embodied in a collectivebargaining agreement--for the collective-bargaining processmay take place before the making of any agreement or after
an agreement has expired. Yet a multiemployer bargainingprocess itself necessarily involves many procedural and substantive understandings among participating employers aswell as with the union. Petitioners cannot rescue their principle by claiming that the exemption applies only insofar asboth labor and management consent to those understandings.
Often labor will not (and should not) consent to certain com-mon bargaining positions that employers intend to maintain.
Cf. Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law || 229'd, at 277("[J]oint employer preparation and bargaining in the context
of a formal multi-employer bargaining unit is clearly ex-empt"). Similarly, labor need not consent to certain tactics
that this Court has approved as part of the multiemployer

Opinion of the Court
bargaining process, such as unit-wide lockouts and the use oftemporary replacements. See NLRB v. Brown, 380 U. S.

278, 284 (1965); Buffalo Linen, 353 U. S., at 97.Petitioners cannot save their consent principle by weakening it, as by requiring union consent only to the multi-employer bargaining process itself. This general consent is
automatically present whenever multiemployer bargainingtakes place. See

Hi-Way Billboards, Inc., 206 N. L. R. B.22 (1973) (multiemployer unit "based on consent" and "established by an unequivocal agreement by the parties"), enf. de-nied on other grounds, 500 F. 2d 181 (CA5 1974); Weyerhaeuser Co., 166 N. L. R. B. 299, 299-300 (1967). As soweakened, the principle cannot help decide

which relatedpractices are, or are not, subject to antitrust immunity.

B
The Government argues that the exemption should termi-nate at the point of impasse. After impasse, it says, "employers no longer have a duty under the labor laws to main-tain the status quo," and "are free as a matter of labor law
to negotiate individual arrangements on an interim basiswith the union." Brief for United States et al. as Amici
Curiae 17.Employers, however, are not completely free at impasse to
act independently. The multiemployer bargaining unit ordi-narily remains intact; individual employers cannot withdraw.
Bonanno Linen, 454 U. S., at 410-413. The duty to bargainsurvives; employers must stand ready to resume collective
bargaining. See, e. g., Worldwide Detective Bureau, 296N. L. R. B. 148, 155 (1989);

Hi-Way Billboards, Inc., supra,at 23. And individual employers can negotiate individual interim agreements with the union only insofar as those agree-ments are consistent with "the duty to abide by the results
of group bargaining." Bonanno Linen, supra, at 416. Re-gardless, the absence of a legal "duty" to act jointly is not
determinative. This Court has implied antitrust immunities

Opinion of the Court
that extend beyond statutorily required joint action to jointaction that a statute "expressly or impliedly allows or assumes must also be immune." 1 P. Areeda & D. Turner,Antitrust Law || 224, p. 145 (1978); see,

e. g., Gordon v. New
York Stock Exchange, Inc., 422 U. S. 659, 682-691 (1975) (immunizing application of joint rule that securities law permit-ted, but did not require);

United States v. National Assn. of
Securities Dealers, Inc., 422 U. S. 694, 720-730 (1975) (same).More importantly, the simple "impasse" line would not

solve the basic problem we have described above. Supra,at 241-242. Labor law permits employers, after impasse, to
engage in considerable joint behavior, including joint lockouts and replacement hiring. See, e. g., Brown, supra, at
289 (hiring of temporary replacement workers after lockout
was "reasonably adapted to the achievement of a legitimate
end--preserving the integrity of the multiemployer bargaining unit"). Indeed, as a general matter, labor law often limits employers to four options at impasse: (1) maintain the
status quo, (2) implement their last offer, (3) lock out their
workers (and either shut down or hire temporary replacements), or (4) negotiate separate interim agreements with
the union. See generally 1 Hardin, The Developing Labor
Law, at 516-520, 696-699. What is to happen if the parties
cannot reach an interim agreement? The other alternatives
are limited. Uniform employer conduct is likely. Uniformity--at least when accompanied by discussion of the matter--
invites antitrust attack. And such attack would ask antitrust courts to decide the lawfulness of activities intimately
related to the bargaining process.

The problem is aggravated by the fact that "impasse" is
often temporary, see Bonanno Linen, supra, at 412 (approving Board's view of impasse as "a recurring feature in the
bargaining process, . . . a temporary deadlock or hiatus in
negotiations which in almost all cases is eventually broken,
through either a change of mind or the application of economic force") (internal quotation marks omitted); W. Sim518us1$78Q 05-18-99 21:24:57 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
kin & N. Fidandis, Mediation and the Dynamics of Collective
Bargaining 139-140 (2d ed. 1986); it may differ from bargaining only in degree, see 1 Hardin, supra, at 691-696; Taft
Broadcasting Co., 163 N. L. R. B., at 478; it may be manipulated by the parties for bargaining purposes, see Bonanno
Linen, supra, at 413, n. 8 (parties might, for strategic purposes, "precipitate an impasse"); and it may occur several
times during the course of a single labor dispute, since the
bargaining process is not over when the first impasse is
reached, cf. J. Bartlett, Familiar Quotations 754:8 (16th ed.
1992). How are employers to discuss future bargaining
positions during a temporary impasse? Consider, too, the
adverse consequences that flow from failing to guess how an
antitrust court would later draw the impasse line. Employers who erroneously concluded that impasse had not been
reached would risk antitrust liability were they collectively
to maintain the status quo, while employers who erroneously
concluded that impasse had occurred would risk unfair labor
practice charges for prematurely suspending multiemployer
negotiations.

The United States responds with suggestions for softening an "impasse" rule by extending the exemption after impasse "for such time as would be reasonable in the circumstances" for employers to consult with counsel, confirm that
impasse has occurred, and adjust their business operations,
Brief for United States et al. as Amici Curiae 24; by reestablishing the exemption once there is a "resumption of goodfaith bargaining," id., at 18, n. 5; and by looking to antitrust
law's "rule of reason" to shield--"in some circumstances"--
such joint actions as the unit-wide lockout or the concerted
maintenance of previously established joint benefit or retirement plans, ibid. But even as so modified, the impasserelated rule creates an exemption that can evaporate in the
middle of the bargaining process, leaving later antitrust
courts free to second-guess the parties' bargaining decisions

Opinion of the Court
and consequently forcing them to choose their collective-bargaining responses in light of what they predict or fear

that antitrust courts, not labor law administrators, will even-tually decide. Cf. Dallas General Drivers, Warehousemen
and Helpers, Local Union No. 745 v. NLRB, 355 F. 2d 842,844-845 (CADC 1966) ("The problem of deciding when further bargaining . . . is futile is often difficult for the bargain-ers and is necessarily so for the Board. But in the whole
complex of industrial relations few issues are less suited toappellate judicial appraisal . . . or better suited to the expert
experience of a board which deals constantly with suchproblems").

C
Petitioners and their supporters argue in the alternativefor a rule that would exempt postimpasse agreement about

bargaining "tactics," but not postimpasse agreement aboutsubstantive "terms," from the reach of antitrust. See 50 F.
3d, at 1066-1069 (Wald, J., dissenting). They recognize,however, that both the Board and the courts have said that
employers can, and often do, employ the imposition of"terms" as a bargaining "tactic." See,

e. g., American ShipBuilding Co. v. NLRB, 380 U. S. 300, 316 (1965); ColoradoUte Elec. Assn., Inc. v. NLRB, 939 F. 2d 1392, 1404 (CA101991), cert. denied, 504 U. S. 955 (1992);

Circuit-Wise, Inc.,309 N. L. R. B. 905, 921 (1992); Hi-Way Billboards, 206

N. L. R. B., at 23; Bonanno Linen, 243 N. L. R. B., at 1094.This concession as to joint "tactical" implementation would
turn the presence of an antitrust exemption upon a determi-nation of the employers' primary purpose or motive. See,
e. g., 50 F. 3d, at 1069 (Wald, J., dissenting). But to ask antitrust courts, insulated from the bargaining process, to in-vestigate an employer group's subjective motive is to ask

them to conduct an inquiry often more amorphous than thosewe have previously discussed. And, in our view, a labor/
antitrust line drawn on such a basis would too often raise

248 BROWN v. PRO FOOTBALL, INC.

Opinion of the Court
the same related (previously discussed) problems. See
supra, at 237, 241-242; Jewel Tea, 381 U. S., at 716 (opinion
of Goldberg, J.) (expressing concern about antitrust judges
"roaming at large" through the bargaining process).

D
Petitioners make several other arguments. They point,
for example, to cases holding applicable, in collectivebargaining contexts, general "backdrop" statutes, such as
a state statute requiring a plant-closing employer to make
employee severance payments, Fort Halifax Packing Co.
v. Coyne, 482 U. S. 1 (1987), and a state statute mandating
certain minimum health benefits, Metropolitan Life Ins.
Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724 (1985). Those statutes,
however, " `neither encourage[d] nor discourage[d] the
collective-bargaining processes that are the subject of the
[federal labor laws].' " Fort Halifax, supra, at 21 (quoting
Metropolitan Life, supra, at 755). Neither did those statutes come accompanied with antitrust's labor-related history.
Cf. Oliver, 358 U. S., at 295-297 (state antitrust law interferes with collective bargaining and is not applicable to
labor-management agreement).

Petitioners also say that irrespective of how the labor exemption applies elsewhere to multiemployer collective bargaining, professional sports is "special." We can understand
how professional sports may be special in terms of, say, interest, excitement, or concern. But we do not understand
how they are special in respect to labor law's antitrust
exemption. We concede that the clubs that make up a professional sports league are not completely independent economic competitors, as they depend upon a degree of cooperation for economic survival. National Collegiate Athletic
Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U. S. 85,
101-102 (1984); App. 110-115 (declaration of NFL Commissioner). In the present context, however, that circumstance

249Cite as: 518 U. S. 231 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
makes the league more like a single bargaining employer,which analogy seems irrelevant to the legal issue before us.

We also concede that football players often have specialindividual talents, and, unlike many unionized workers, they
often negotiate their pay individually with their employers.
See post, at 255 (Stevens, J., dissenting). But this charac-teristic seems simply a feature, like so many others, that

might give employees (or employers) more (or less) bargain-ing power, that might lead some (or all) of them to favor a
particular kind of bargaining, or that might lead to certaindemands at the bargaining table. We do not see how it
could make a critical legal difference in determining the underlying framework in which bargaining is to take place.
See generally Jacobs & Winter, Antitrust Principles and Collective Bargaining by Athletes: Of Superstars in Peonage, 81
Yale L. J. 1 (1971). Indeed, it would be odd to fashion an
antitrust exemption that gave additional advantages to professional football players (by virtue of their superior bargaining power) that transport workers, coal miners, or meat
packers would not enjoy.

The dissent points to other "unique features" of the parties' collective-bargaining relationship, which, in the dissent's
view, make the case "atypical." Post, at 255. It says, for
example, that the employers imposed the restraint simply
to enforce compliance with league-wide rules, and that the
bargaining consisted of nothing more than the sending of a
"notice," and therefore amounted only to "so-called" bargaining. Post, at 256-257. Insofar as these features underlie
an argument for looking to the employers' true purpose, we
have already discussed them. See supra, at 247-248. Insofar as they suggest that there was not a genuine impasse,
they fight the basic assumption upon which the District
Court, the Court of Appeals, petitioners, and this Court rest
the case. See 782 F. Supp. 125, 134 (DC 1991); 50 F. 3d,
at 1056-1057; Pet. for Cert. i. Ultimately, we cannot find a
satisfactory basis for distinguishing football players from

518us1$78Q 05-18-99 21:24:57 PAGES OPINPGT
250 BROWN v. PRO FOOTBALL, INC.

Opinion of the Court
other organized workers. We therefore conclude that allmust abide by the same legal rules.

* * *
For these reasons, we hold that the implicit ("nonstatu-tory") antitrust exemption applies to the employer conduct

at issue here. That conduct took place during and immedi-ately after a collective-bargaining negotiation. It grew out
of, and was directly related to, the lawful operation of thebargaining process. It involved a matter that the parties
were required to negotiate collectively. And it concernedonly the parties to the collective-bargaining relationship.

Our holding is not intended to insulate from antitrustreview every joint imposition of terms by employers, for an
agreement among employers could be sufficiently distant intime and in circumstances from the collective-bargaining
process that a rule permitting antitrust intervention wouldnot significantly interfere with that process. See, e. g., 50 F.
3d, at 1057 (suggesting that exemption lasts until collapse ofthe collective-bargaining relationship, as evidenced by decertification of the union); El Cerrito Mill & Lumber Co., 316N. L. R. B., at 1006-1007 (suggesting that "extremely long"
impasse, accompanied by "instability" or "defunctness" ofmultiemployer unit, might justify union withdrawal from
group bargaining). We need not decide in this case whether,or where, within these extreme outer boundaries to draw
that line. Nor would it be appropriate for us to do so with-out the detailed views of the Board, to whose "specialized
judgment" Congress "intended to leave" many of the "inevi-table questions concerning multiemployer bargaining bound
to arise in the future." Buffalo Linen, 353 U. S., at 96 (in-ternal quotation marks omitted); see also Jewel Tea, 381
U. S., at 710, n. 18.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Stevens, J., dissenting
Justice Stevens, dissenting.
In his classic dissent in Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45,
75 (1905), Justice Holmes reminded us that our disagreement
with the economic theory embodied in legislation should not
affect our judgment about its constitutionality. It is equally
important, of course, to be faithful to the economic theory
underlying broad statutory mandates when we are construing their impact on areas of the economy not specifically addressed by their texts. The unique features of this case lead
me to conclude that the Court has reached a decision that
conflicts with the basic purpose of both the antitrust laws
and the national labor policy expressed in a series of congressional enactments.

I

The basic premise underlying the Sherman Act is the assumption that free competition among business entities will
produce the best price levels. National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U. S. 679, 695 (1978).
Collusion among competitors, it is believed, may produce
prices that harm consumers. United States v. SoconyVacuum Oil Co., 310 U. S. 150, 226, n. 59 (1940). Similarly,
the Court has held, a marketwide agreement among employers setting wages at levels that would not prevail in a free
market may violate the Sherman Act. Anderson v. Shipowners Assn. of Pacific Coast, 272 U. S. 359 (1926).

The jury's verdict in this case has determined that the
marketwide agreement among these employers fixed the salaries of the replacement players at a dramatically lower level
than would obtain in a free market. While the special characteristics of this industry may provide a justification for the
agreement under the rule of reason, see National Collegiate
Athletic Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468
U. S. 85, 100-104 (1984), at this stage of the proceeding our
analysis of the exemption issue must accept the premise that
the agreement is unlawful unless it is exempt.

Stevens, J., dissenting
The basic premise underlying our national labor policy isthat unregulated competition among employees and applicants for employment produces wage levels that are lowerthan they should be.

1 Whether or not the premise is true

in fact, it is surely the basis for the statutes that encourageand protect the collective-bargaining process, including the

express statutory exemptions from the antitrust laws that
Congress enacted in order to protect union activities.2Those statutes were enacted to enable collective action by

union members to achieve wage levels that are higher thanwould be available in a free market. See

Trainmen v. Chicago R. & I. R. Co., 353 U. S. 30, 40 (1957).The statutory labor exemption protects the right of workers to act collectively to seek better wages, but does not

1 "The inequality of bargaining power between employees who do not
possess full freedom of association or actual liberty of contract, and employers who are organized in the corporate or other forms of ownership
association substantially burdens and affects the flow of commerce, and
tends to aggravate recurrent business depressions, by depressing wage
rates and the purchasing power of wage earners in industry and by preventing the stabilization of competitive wage rates and working conditions
within and between industries." 29 U. S. C. $ 151; R. Posner & F. Easterbrook, Antitrust 31 (2d ed. 1981) ("The main purpose of labor unions is to
raise wages by suppressing competition among workers . . ."); see also
Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., 381 U. S. 676, 723 (1965) (opinion of Goldberg, J.) ("The very purpose and effect of a labor union is to limit the
power of an employer to use competition among workingmen to drive
down wage rates and enforce substandard conditions of employment").

2 "The basic sources of organized labor's exemption from federal antitrust laws are $$ 6 and 20 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731 and 738, 15
U. S. C. $ 17 and 29 U. S. C. $ 52, and the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 47 Stat.
70, 71, and 73, 29 U. S. C. $$ 104, 105, and 113. These statutes declare that
labor unions are not combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade,
and exempt specific union activities, including secondary picketing and
boycotts, from the operation of the antitrust laws. See United States v.
Hutcheson, 312 U. S. 219 (1941). They do not exempt concerted action
or agreements between unions and nonlabor parties. Mine Workers v.
Pennington, 381 U. S. 657, 662 (1965)." Connell Constr. Co. v. Plumbers,

conflicting policies of the antitrust and labor statutes in the
context of action between employers and unions. Ibid.The limited judicial exemption complements its statutory

counterpart by ensuring that unions which engage in collec-tive bargaining to enhance employees' wages may enjoy the
benefits of the resulting agreements. The purpose of thelabor laws would be frustrated if it were illegal for employers to enter into industrywide agreements providing supracompetitive wages for employees. For that reason, we have
explained that "a proper accommodation between the congressional policy favoring collective bargaining under the
NLRA and the congressional policy favoring free competition in business markets requires that some union-employer
agreements be accorded a limited nonstatutory exemption
from antitrust sanctions." Id., at 622.

Consistent with basic labor law policies, I agree with the
Court that the judicially crafted labor exemption must also
cover some collective action that employers take in response
to a collective-bargaining agent's demands for higher wages.
Immunizing such action from antitrust scrutiny may facilitate collective bargaining over labor demands. So, too, may
immunizing concerted employer action designed to maintain
the integrity of the multiemployer bargaining unit, such as
lockouts that are imposed in response to "a union strike tactic which threatens the destruction of the employers' interest
in bargaining on a group basis." NLRB v. Truck Drivers,
353 U. S. 87, 93 (1957).

In my view, however, neither the policies underlying the
two separate statutory schemes, nor the narrower focus on
the purpose of the nonstatutory exemption, provides a justification for exempting from antitrust scrutiny collective action initiated by employers to depress wages below the level

that would be produced in a free market. Nor do those poli-cies support a rule that would allow employers to suppress

wages by implementing noncompetitive agreements amongthemselves on matters that have not previously been the
subject of either an agreement with labor or even a demandby labor for inclusion in the bargaining process. That, however, is what is at stake in this litigation.

II
In light of the accommodation that has been struck be-tween antitrust and labor law policy, it would be most ironic

to extend an exemption crafted to protect collective actionby employees to protect employers acting jointly to deny
employees the opportunity to negotiate their salaries indi-vidually in a competitive market. Perhaps aware of the
irony, the Court chooses to analyze this case as though itrepresented a typical impasse in an unexceptional multiemployer bargaining process. In so doing, it glosses over threeunique features of the case that are critical to the inquiry
into whether the policies of the labor laws require extensionof the nonstatutory labor exemption to this atypical case.

First, in this market, unlike any other area of labor lawimplicated in the cases cited by the Court, player salaries
are individually negotiated. The practice of individually ne-gotiating player salaries prevailed even prior to collective
bargaining.3 The players did not challenge the prevailing

3 As the District Court explained: "The present case does not involve
any change in preexisting wage terms of either an active or expired collective bargaining agreement. In fact, creation of the developmental squads
added a novel category of players to each NFL club. These players were
not treated under the salary terms applicable to regular NFL players.
Under the 1982 Collective Bargaining Agreement, the NFL players were
expressly given the right to negotiate the salary terms of their contracts.
1982 Collective Bargaining Agreement at Article XXII, Plaintiffs' Exhibits at 1. By contrast, the developmental squad contracts indicates that
the prospective developmental squad players had no right to negotiate
their own salary terms but instead were to receive a fixed non-negotiable

practice because, unlike employees in most industries, theywant their compensation to be determined by the forces of

the free market rather than by the process of collective bar-gaining. Thus, although the majority professes an inability
to understand anything special about professional sportsthat should affect the framework of labor negotiations,

ante,at 248-249, in this business it is the employers, not the employees, who seek to impose a noncompetitive uniform wageon a segment of the market and to put an end to competitive
wage negotiations.Second, respondents concede that the employers imposed
the wage restraint to force owners to comply with league-wide rules that limit the number of players that may serve
on a team, not to facilitate a stalled bargaining process, orto revisit any issue previously subjected to bargaining.
Brief for Respondents 4. The employers could have con-fronted the culprits directly by stepping up enforcement of
roster limits. They instead chose to address the problem byunilaterally preventing players from individually competing
in the labor market.Third, although the majority asserts that the "club owners
had bargained with the players' union over a wage issue untilthey reached impasse," ante, at 234, that hardly constitutes a
complete description of what transpired. When the employ-ers' representative advised the union that they proposed to
pay the players a uniform wage determined by the owners,the union promptly and unequivocally responded that their
proposal was inconsistent with the "principle" of individualsalary negotiation that had been accepted in the past and
that predated collective bargaining.4 The so-called "barsalary of $1,000 per week. Plaintiffs' Exhibits at 8, 9, 15 & 28." 782
F. Supp. 125, 138 (DC 1991).

"Gene [Upshaw] indicated he fully understood the developmental squad
but could not agree to any arrangement that eliminated the right of any

gaining" that followed amounted to nothing more than theemployers' notice to the union that they had decided to implement a decision to replace individual salary negotiationswith a uniform wage level for a specific group of players.

5

Given these features of the case, I do not see why theemployers should be entitled to a judicially crafted exemption from antitrust liability. We have explained that "[t]henonstatutory exemption has its source in the strong labor
policy favoring the association of employees to eliminatecompetition over wages and working conditions."

ConnellConstr. Co., 421 U. S., at 622. I know of no similarly strong

labor policy that favors the association of employers to elimi-nate a competitive method of negotiating wages that predates collective bargaining and that labor would prefer topreserve.

Even if some collective action by employers may justify anexemption because it is necessary to maintain the "integrity
of the multiemployer bargaining unit," NLRB v. Brown, 380U. S. 278, 289 (1965), no such justification exists here. The
employers imposed a fixed wage even though there was nodispute over the pre-existing principle that player salaries
should be individually negotiated. They sought only to pre-vent certain owners from evading roster limits and thereby
gaining an unfair advantage. Because "the employer's in-terest is a competitive interest rather than an interest in
regulating its own labor relations," Mine Workers v. Pen-nington, 381 U. S. 657, 667 (1965), there would seem to be no

player to negotiate his individual salary. Upshaw said that no matter
what salary level we proposed to pay developmental players, whether it
was our $1,000 weekly or a higher number, the union would not `in principle' permit two classes of players to exist, one with individual bargaining
rights and one without." App. 19-20.

5 The unique features of this case presumably explain why the National

Labor Relations Board (Labor Board) can endorse the position of the players in this case without fearing the adverse impact on the bargaining process in the hypothetical cases that concern the Court. Brief for United
States et al. as Amici Curiae 27, n. 10.

Stevens, J., dissenting
more reason to exempt this concerted, anticompetitive em-ployer action from the antitrust laws than the action held

unlawful in Radovich v. National Football League, 352 U. S.445 (1957).

The point of identifying the unique features of this case isnot, as the Court suggests, to make the case that professional
football players, alone among workers, should be entitled toenforce the antitrust laws against anticompetitive collective
employer action. Ante, at 249. Other employees, no lessthan well-paid athletes, are entitled to the protections of the
antitrust laws when their employers unite to undertake anti-competitive action that causes them direct harm and alters
the state of employer-employee relations that existed priorto unionization. Here that alteration occurred because the
wage terms that the employers unilaterally imposed directlyconflict with a pre-existing principle of agreement between
the bargaining parties. In other contexts, the alterationmay take other similarly anticompetitive and unjustifiable
forms. III

Although exemptions should be construed narrowly, andjudicially crafted exemptions more narrowly still, the Court
provides a sweeping justification for the exemption that itcreates today. The consequence is a newly minted exemption that, as I shall explain, the Court crafts only by ignoringthe reasoning of one of our prior decisions in favor of the
views of the dissenting Justice in that case. Of course, theCourt actually holds only that this new exemption applies in
cases such as the present in which the parties to the bargain-ing process are affected by the challenged anticompetitive
conduct. Ante, at 250. But that welcome limitation on itsopinion fails to make the Court's explanation of its result in
this case any more persuasive.The Court explains that the nonstatutory labor exemption
serves to ensure that "antitrust courts" will not end up sub-stituting their views of labor policy for those of either the

Stevens, J., dissenting
Labor Board or the bargaining parties. Ante, at 236-237.The Court concludes, therefore, that almost any concerted

action by employers that touches on a mandatory subject ofcollective bargaining, no matter how obviously offensive to
the policies underlying the Nation's antitrust statutes,
should be immune from scrutiny so long as a collective-bargaining process is in place. It notes that a contrary conclusion would require "antitrust courts, insulated from thebargaining process, to investigate an employer group's subjective motive," a task that it believes too "amorphous" tobe permissible.

Ante, at 247.
The argument that "antitrust courts" should be kept out
of the collective-bargaining process has a venerable lineage.
See Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering, 254 U. S. 443,
483-488 (1921) (Brandeis, J., joined by Holmes and Clarke,
JJ., dissenting). Our prior precedents subscribing to its
basic point, however, do not justify the conclusion that employees have no recourse other than the Labor Board when
employers collectively undertake anticompetitive action. In
fact, they contradict it.

We have previously considered the scope of the nonstatutory labor exemption only in cases involving challenges to
anticompetitive agreements between unions and employers
brought by other employers not parties to those agreements.
Ante, at 243. Even then, we have concluded that the exemption does not always apply. See Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U. S., at 663.

As Pennington explained, the mere fact that an antitrust
challenge touches on an issue, such as wages, that is subject
to mandatory bargaining does not suffice to trigger the judicially fashioned exemption. Id., at 664. Moreover, we concluded that the exemption should not obtain in Pennington
itself only after we examined the motives of one of the parties to the bargaining process. Id., at 667.

The Court's only attempt to square its decision with Pennington occurs at the close of its opinion. It concludes that

518us1$78I 05-18-99 21:24:57 PAGES OPINPGT
260 BROWN v. PRO FOOTBALL, INC.

Stevens, J., dissenting
the exemption applies because the employers' action "grew
out of, and was directly related to, the lawful operation of
the bargaining process," "[i]t involved a matter that the parties were required to negotiate collectively," and that "concerned only the parties to the collective-bargaining relationship." Ante, at 250.

As to the first two qualifiers, the same could be said of
Pennington. Indeed, the same was said and rejected in
Pennington. "This is not to say that an agreement resulting from union-employer negotiations is automatically exempt from Sherman Act scrutiny simply because the negotiations involve a compulsory subject of bargaining, regardless
of the subject or the form and content of the agreement."
381 U. S., at 664-665.

The final qualifier does distinguish Pennington, but only
partially so. To determine whether the exemption applied
in Pennington, we undertook a detailed examination into
whether the policies of labor law so strongly supported the
agreement struck by the bargaining parties that it should be
immune from antitrust scrutiny. We concluded that because
the agreement affected employers not parties to the bargaining process, labor law policies could not be understood to
require the exemption.

Here, however, the Court does not undertake a review of
labor law policy to determine whether it would support an
exemption for the unilateral imposition of anticompetitive
wage terms by employers on a union. The Court appears
to conclude instead that the exemption should apply merely
because the employers' action was implemented during a
lawful negotiating process concerning a mandatory subject
of bargaining. Thus, the Court's analysis would seem to
constitute both an unprecedented expansion of a heretofore
limited exemption, and an unexplained repudiation of the
reasoning in a prior, nonconstitutional decision that Congress itself has not seen fit to override.

Stevens, J., dissenting
The Court nevertheless contends that the "rationale" of
our prior cases supports its approach. Ante, at 243. As
support for that contention, it relies heavily on the views
espoused in Justice Goldberg's separate opinion in Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., 381 U. S. 676 (1965). At five critical
junctures in its opinion, see ante, at 236, 237-238, 242, 247-
248, the Court invokes that separate concurrence to explain
why, for purposes of applying the nonstatutory labor exemption, labor law policy admits of no distinction between collective employer action taken in response to labor demands and
collective employer action of the kind we consider here.

It should be remembered that Jewel Tea concerned only
the question whether an agreement between employers and
a union may be exempt, and that even then the Court did not
accept the broad antitrust exemption that Justice Goldberg
advocated. Instead, Justice White, the author of Pennington, writing for Chief Justice Warren and Justice Brennan,
explained that even in disputes over the lawfulness of agreements about terms that are subject to mandatory bargaining,
courts must examine the bargaining process to determine
whether antitrust scrutiny should obtain. Jewel Tea, 381
U. S., at 688-697. "The crucial determinant is not the form
of the agreement--e. g., prices or wages--but its relative
impact on the product market and the interests of union
members." Id., at 690, n. 5 (emphasis added). Moreover,
the three dissenters, Justices Douglas, Clark, and Black,
concluded that the union was entitled to no immunity at all.
Id., at 735-738.

It should also be remembered that Justice Goldberg used
his separate opinion in Jewel Tea to explain his reasons for
dissenting from the Court's opinion in Pennington. He explained that the Court's approach in Pennington was unjustifiable precisely because it permitted "antitrust courts" to
reexamine the bargaining process. The Court fails to explain its apparent substitution in this case of Justice Gold518us1$78I 05-18-99 21:24:57 PAGES OPINPGT

Stevens, J., dissenting
berg's understanding of the exemption, an understandingpreviously endorsed by only two other Justices, for the one

adopted by the Court in Pennington.The Court's silence is all the more remarkable in light of
the patent factual distinctions between Jewel Tea and the
present case. It is not at all clear that Justice Goldberghimself understood his expansive rationale to require application of the exemption in circumstances such as those beforeus here. Indeed, the main theme of his opinion was that the
antitrust laws should not be used to circumscribe bargain-ing over union demands.

Jewel Tea, 381 U. S., at 723-725.
Moreover, Justice Goldberg proved himself to be a most unreliable advocate for the sweeping position that the Court
attributes to him.

Not long after leaving the Court, Justice Goldberg served
as counsel for Curt Flood, a professional baseball player
who contended that major league baseball's reserve clause
violated the antitrust laws. Flood v. Kuhn, 407 U. S. 258
(1972). Although the Flood case primarily concerned
whether professional baseball should be exempt from antitrust law altogether, see Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore, Inc. v. National League of Professional Baseball
Clubs, 259 U. S. 200 (1922); Toolson v. New York Yankees,
Inc., 346 U. S. 356 (1953), the labor law dimensions of the
case did not go unnoticed.

The article that first advanced the expansive view of the
nonstatutory labor exemption that the Court appears now to
endorse was written shortly after this Court granted certiorari in Flood, see Jacobs & Winter, Antitrust Principles and

Collective Bargaining by Athletes: Of Superstars in Peonage,
81 Yale L. J. 1 (1971), and the parties to the case addressed
the very questions now before us. Aware of both this commentary, and, of course, his own prior opinion in Jewel Tea,
Justice Goldberg explained in his brief to this Court why
baseball's reserve clause should not be protected from antitrust review by the nonstatutory labor exemption.

"This Court has held that even a labor organization, theprincipal intended beneficiary of the so-called labor exemption, may not escape antitrust liability when it acts,not unilaterally and in the sole interest of its own members, but in concert with employers `to prescribe labor
standards outside the bargaining unit[.]' And this is soeven when the issue is so central to bargaining as wages.

Flood v. Kuhn, O. T. 1971, No. 71-32, pp. 13-14.

Moreover, Justice Goldberg explained that the extension
of antitrust immunity to unilateral, anticompetitive employer
action would be particularly inappropriate because baseball's
reserve clause predated collective bargaining.

"This case is in fact much clearer than Pennington,
Meat Cutters, or Ramsey, for petitioner does not challenge the fruits of collective bargaining activity. He
seeks relief from a scheme--the reserve system--which

Baseball admits has been in existence for nearly acentury, and which the trial court expressly found was

`created and imposed by the club owners long beforethe arrival of collective bargaining.' " Id., at 14.

I would add only that this case is in fact much clearer thanFlood, for there the owners sought only to preserve a restraint on competition to which the union had not agreed,while here they seek to create one.

Adoption of Justice Goldberg's views would mean, ofcourse, that in some instances "antitrust courts" would have
to displace the authority of the Labor Board. The laborlaws do not exist, however, to ensure the perpetuation of
the Board's authority. That is why we have not previouslyadopted the Court's position. That is also why in other contexts we have not thought the mere existence of a collective-bargaining agreement sufficient to immunize employers from
background laws that are similar to the Sherman Act. SeeFort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U. S. 1 (1987); Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724 (1985).6

6 In Teamsters v. Oliver, 358 U. S. 283 (1959), we held that a state antitrust law could not be used to challenge an employer-union agreement.
Justice White's opinion in Jewel Tea explains, however, that Oliver held
only that "[a]s the agreement did not embody a ` "remote and indirect
approach to the subject of wages" . . . but a direct frontal attack upon a
problem thought to threaten the maintenance of the basic wage structure
established by the collective bargaining contract,' [358 U. S.], at 294, the
paramount federal policy of encouraging collective bargaining proscribed
application of the state law." Jewel Tea Co., 381 U. S., at 690, n. 5.

Moreover, in the petition for certiorari in Flood, Justice Goldberg
explained that Oliver was not controlling.

"Petitioner has not addressed the contention advanced by respondents
at trial but not reached by the courts below, that the reserve system is a
matter for collective bargaining and hence exempt from state and federal
antitrust laws under Teamsters Union v. Oliver, 358 U. S. 283 (1959), and
Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., 381 U. S. 676 (1965). Neither of these decisions holds that an employer conspiracy to restrain trade is exempted from
antitrust regulation where an employee group has been implicated in the
scheme. No Justice participating in Meat Cutters dissented from the

Congress is free to act to exempt the anticompetitive em-ployer conduct that we review today. In the absence of such

action, I do not believe it is for us to stretch the limitedexemption that we have fashioned to facilitate the express
statutory exemption created for labor's benefit so that unionsmust strike in order to restore a prior practice of individually negotiating salaries. I therefore agree with the posi-tion that the District Court adopted below.

"Because the developmental squad salary provisionswere a new concept and not a change in terms of the
expired collective bargaining agreement, the policy be-hind continuing the nonstatutory labor exemption for
the terms of a collective bargaining agreement after ex-piration (to foster an atmosphere conducive to the negotiation of a new collective bargaining agreement) doesnot apply. To hold that the nonstatutory labor exemption extends to shield the NFL from antitrust liabilityfor imposing restraints never before agreed to by the
union would not only infringe on the union's freedom tocontract,

H. K. Porter Co. v. NLRB, 397 U. S. at 108 . . .(one of fundamental policies of NLRA is freedom of

contract), but would also contradict the very purposeof the antitrust exemption by not promoting execution
of a collective bargaining agreement with terms mutuproposition that hard core `anticompetitive commercial restraint[s]' like
`price-fixing and market allocation'--and petitioner would add group boycotts--were subject to antitrust regulation even where bargained about.

sports are now regulated by state and federal antitrust laws." Pet. for

267OCTOBER TERM, 1995
Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. URSERY
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 95-345. Argued April 17, 1996--Decided June 24, 1996*
In No. 95-345, the Government instituted civil forfeiture proceedings

under 21 U. S. C. $ 881(a)(7) against respondent Ursery's house, alleging
that it had been used to facilitate illegal drug transactions. Shortly
before Ursery settled that claim, he was indicted, and was later convicted, of manufacturing marijuana in violation of $ 841(a)(1). In No.
95-346, the Government filed a civil in rem complaint against various
property seized from, or titled to, respondents Arlt and Wren or Arlt's
corporation, alleging that each item was subject to forfeiture under 18
U. S. C. $ 981(a)(1)(A) because it was involved in money laundering violative of $ 1956, and to forfeiture under 21 U. S. C. $ 881(a)(6) as the proceeds of a felonious drug transaction. Litigation of the forfeiture action
was deferred while Arlt and Wren were prosecuted on drug and moneylaundering charges under $ 846 and 18 U. S. C. $$ 371 and 1956. After
their convictions, the District Court granted the Government's motion
for summary judgment in the forfeiture proceeding. The Courts of Appeals reversed Ursery's conviction and the forfeiture judgment against
Arlt and Wren, holding that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits the
Government from both punishing a defendant for a criminal offense and
forfeiting his property for that same offense in a separate civil proceeding. The courts reasoned in part that United States v. Halper, 490 U. S.
435, and Austin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602, meant that, as a categorical matter, civil forfeitures always constitute "punishment" for double
jeopardy purposes. This Court consolidated the cases.

Held: In rem civil forfeitures are neither "punishment" nor criminal for

purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. Pp. 273-292.

(a) Congress long has authorized the Government to bring parallel
criminal actions and in rem civil forfeiture proceedings based upon the
same underlying events, see, e. g., The Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 1, 14-15, and
this Court consistently has concluded that the Double Jeopardy Clause
does not apply to such forfeitures because they do not impose punishment, see, e. g., Various Items of Personal Property v. United States,

*Together with No. 95-346, United States v. $405,089.23 in United
States Currency et al., on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals

Syllabus
282 U. S. 577, 581; One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, 409
U. S. 232, 235-236 (per curiam). In its most recent case, United States
v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S. 354, the Court held that a
forfeiture was not barred by a prior criminal proceeding after applying
a two-part test asking, first, whether Congress intended the particular
forfeiture to be a remedial civil sanction or a criminal penalty, and, second, whether the forfeiture proceedings are so punitive in fact as to
establish that they may not legitimately be viewed as civil in nature,
despite any congressional intent to establish a civil remedial mechanism. Pp. 274-278.

(b) Though the 89 Firearms test was more refined, perhaps, than the
Court's Various Items analysis, the conclusion was the same in each
case: In rem civil forfeiture is a remedial civil sanction, distinct from
potentially punitive in personam civil penalties such as fines, and does
not constitute a punishment for double jeopardy purposes. See Gore v.
United States, 357 U. S. 386, 392. The Courts of Appeals misread
Halper, Austin, and Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch,
511 U. S. 767, as having abandoned this oft-affirmed rule. None of
those decisions purported to overrule Various Items, Emerald Cut
Stones, and 89 Firearms or to replace the Court's traditional understanding. It would have been remarkable for the Court both to have
held unconstitutional a well-established practice, and to have overruled
a long line of precedent, without having even suggested that it was
doing so. Moreover, the cases in question did not deal with the subject
of these cases: in rem civil forfeitures for double jeopardy purposes.
Halper involved in personam civil penalties under the Double Jeopardy
Clause. Kurth Ranch considered a punitive state tax imposed on marijuana under that Clause. And Austin dealt with civil forfeitures under
the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause. Pp. 278-288.

(c) The forfeitures at issue are civil proceedings under the two-part
89 Firearms test. First, there is little doubt that Congress intended
proceedings under $$ 881 and 981 to be civil, since those statutes' procedural enforcement mechanisms are themselves distinctly civil in nature.
See, e. g., 89 Firearms, 465 U. S., at 363. Second, there is little evidence, much less the "clearest proof" that the Court requires, see, e. g.,
id., at 365, suggesting that forfeiture proceedings under those sections
are so punitive in form and effect as to render them criminal despite
Congress' intent to the contrary. These statutes are, in most significant
respects, indistinguishable from those reviewed, and held not to be punitive, in Various Items, Emerald Cut Stones, and 89 Firearms. That
these are civil proceedings is also supported by other factors that the
Court has found persuasive, including the considerations that (1) in rem
civil forfeiture has not historically been regarded as punishment; (2)

there is no requirement in the statutes at issue that the Government
demonstrate scienter in order to establish that the property is subject
to forfeiture; (3) though both statutes may serve a deterrent purpose,
this purpose may serve civil as well as criminal goals; and (4) the fact
that both are tied to criminal activity is insufficient in itself to render
them punitive. See, e. g., United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 247-248,

In separate cases, the United States Court of Appeals for

prohibits the Government from both punishing a defendant
for a criminal offense and forfeiting his property for that
same offense in a separate civil proceeding. We consolidated those cases for our review, and now reverse. These

Opinion of the Court
not constitute "punishment" for purposes of the Double Jeop-ardy Clause.

I
No. 95-345: Michigan Police found marijuana growingadjacent to respondent Guy Ursery's house, and discovered

marijuana seeds, stems, stalks, and a grow light within thehouse. The United States instituted civil forfeiture proceedings against the house, alleging that the property wassubject to forfeiture under 84 Stat. 1276, as amended, 21
U. S. C. $ 881(a)(7), because it had been used for several yearsto facilitate the unlawful processing and distribution of a controlled substance. Ursery ultimately paid the United States$13,250 to settle the forfeiture claim in full. Shortly before
the settlement was consummated, Ursery was indicted formanufacturing marijuana, in violation of $ 841(a)(1). A jury
found him guilty, and he was sentenced to 63 months inprison.

The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit by a dividedvote reversed Ursery's criminal conviction, holding that the
conviction violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the FifthAmendment of the United States Constitution. 59 F. 3d 568
(1995). The court based its conclusion in part upon its beliefthat our decisions in

United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435(1989), and
Austin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602 (1993),meant that any civil forfeiture under $ 881(a)(7) constitutes

punishment for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.Ursery, in the court's view, had therefore been "punished" in
the forfeiture proceeding against his property, and could notbe subsequently criminally tried for violation of 21 U. S. C.

$ 841(a)(1).

No. 95-346: Following a jury trial, Charles Wesley Arltand James Wren were convicted of: conspiracy to aid and

abet the manufacture of methamphetamine, in violation of 21U. S. C. $ 846; conspiracy to launder monetary instruments,
in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 371; and numerous counts ofmoney laundering, in violation of $ 1956. The District Court

518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT
272 UNITED STATES v. URSERY

Opinion of the Court
sentenced Arlt to life in prison and a 10-year term of super-vised release, and imposed a fine of $250,000. Wren was

sentenced to life imprisonment and a 5-year term of super-vised release.

Before the criminal trial had started, the United States
had filed a civil in rem complaint against various propertyseized from, or titled to, Arlt and Wren, or Payback Mines,

a corporation controlled by Arlt. The complaint allegedthat each piece of property was subject to forfeiture both
under 18 U. S. C. $ 981(a)(1)(A), which provides that "[a]nyproperty . . . involved in a transaction or attempted transaction in violation of " $ 1956 (the money-laundering statute)"is subject to forfeiture to the United States"; and under 21
U. S. C. $ 881(a)(6), which provides for the forfeiture of (i)
"[a]ll . . . things of value furnished or intended to be furnishedby any person in exchange for" illegal drugs, (ii) "all proceeds traceable to such an exchange," and (iii) "all moneys,negotiable instruments, and securities used or intended to be
used to facilitate" a federal drug felony. The parties agreedto defer litigation of the forfeiture action during the criminal prosecution. More than a year after the conclusion ofthe criminal trial, the District Court granted the Government's motion for summary judgment in the civil forfeiture
proceeding.

Arlt and Wren appealed the decision in the forfeiture action, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the forfeiture violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. 33 F. 3d 1210 (1994), amended 56 F. 3d 41
(1995). The court's decision was based in part upon the
same view as that expressed by the Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit in Ursery's case--that our decisions in Halper,
supra, and Austin, supra, meant that, as a categorical matter, forfeitures under $$ 981(a)(1)(A) and 881(a)(6) always
constitute "punishment."

We granted the Government's petition for certiorari in
each of the two cases, and we now reverse. 516 U. S. 1070
(1996).

Opinion of the Court

II
The Double Jeopardy Clause provides: "[N]or shall any
person be subject for the same offence to be twice put
in jeopardy of life or limb." U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. The
Clause serves the function of preventing both "successive
punishments and . . . successive prosecutions." United
States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 696 (1993), citing North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711 (1969). The protection against
multiple punishments prohibits the Government from " `punishing twice, or attempting a second time to punish criminally for the same offense.' " Witte v. United States, 515
U. S. 389, 396 (1995) (emphasis deleted), quoting Helvering v.
Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391, 399 (1938).

In the decisions that we review, the Courts of Appeals held
that the civil forfeitures constituted "punishment," making
them subject to the prohibitions of the Double Jeopardy
Clause. The Government challenges that characterization
of the forfeitures, arguing that the courts were wrong to
conclude that civil forfeitures are punitive for double jeopardy purposes.1

1 The Government raises three other challenges to the decisions that we
review. First, focusing on the decision of the Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit in No. 95-345, the Government contends that the Double
Jeopardy Clause applies only to prohibit a punishment imposed following
a "jeopardy," and that a civil forfeiture, regardless whether it is a "punishment," is not a "jeopardy." Thus, because Ursery had not been placed in
"jeopardy" in the civil forfeiture proceeding against his house, the Double
Jeopardy Clause was inapplicable to his criminal prosecution. Second,
the Government argues that the civil forfeiture of property is not the same
offense as a criminal prosecution, and therefore that the double jeopardy
protection against multiple punishments for the same offense is not at
issue here. Finally, the Government argues that a civil forfeiture action
that is parallel and contemporaneous with a criminal prosecution should
be deemed to constitute a single proceeding within the meaning of the
Double Jeopardy Clause.

Because we conclude that the civil forfeitures involved in these cases do
not constitute punishment under the Double Jeopardy Clause, see infra,
at 292, we do not address those three arguments in this opinion.

274 UNITED STATES v. URSERY

Opinion of the Court

A
Since the earliest years of this Nation, Congress has au-thorized the Government to seek parallel

in rem civil forfeit-ure actions and criminal prosecutions based upon the same

underlying events. See, e. g., Act of July 31, 1789, ch. 5, $ 12,1 Stat. 39 (goods unloaded at night or without a permit subject to forfeiture and persons unloading subject to criminalprosecution); $ 25, id., at 43 (persons convicted of buying or
concealing illegally imported goods subject to both monetaryfine and

in rem forfeiture of the goods); $ 34, id., at 46 (impos-ing criminal penalty and in rem forfeiture where person convicted of relanding goods entitled to drawback); see also ThePalmyra, 12 Wheat. 1, 14-15 (1827) ("Many cases exist,
where there is both a forfeiture in rem and a personal pen-alty"); cf. Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416
U. S. 663, 683 (1974) (discussing adoption of forfeiture stat-utes by early Congresses). And, in a long line of cases, this
Court has considered the application of the Double JeopardyClause to civil forfeitures, consistently concluding that the
Clause does not apply to such actions because they do notimpose punishment.

One of the first cases to consider the relationship betweenthe Double Jeopardy Clause and civil forfeiture was

Various
Items of Personal Property v. United States, 282 U. S. 577(1931). In Various Items, the Waterloo Distilling Corporation had been ordered to forfeit a distillery, warehouse, anddenaturing plant, on the ground that the corporation had
conducted its distilling business in violation of federal law.The Government conceded that the corporation had been
convicted of criminal violations prior to the initiation of theforfeiture proceeding, and admitted that the criminal conviction had been based upon "the transactions set forth . . .as a basis for the forfeiture."

Id., at 579. Considering thecorporation's argument that the forfeiture action violated the

Double Jeopardy Clause, this Court unanimously held thatthe Clause was inapplicable to civil forfeiture actions:

518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT

275Cite as: 518 U. S. 267 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
"[This] forfeiture proceeding . . . is in rem. It is theproperty which is proceeded against, and, by resort to a

legal fiction, held guilty and condemned as though itwere conscious instead of inanimate and insentient. In
a criminal prosecution it is the wrongdoer in person whois proceeded against, convicted, and punished.

The for-feiture is no part of the punishment for the criminal

offense. The provision of the Fifth Amendment to theConstitution in respect of double jeopardy does not
apply." Id., at 581 (citations omitted; emphasis added).
In reaching its conclusion, the Court drew a sharp distinc-tion between

in rem civil forfeitures and in personam civilpenalties such as fines: Though the latter could, in some circumstances, be punitive, the former could not. Ibid. Re-ferring to a case that was decided the same day as Various
Items, the Court made its point absolutely clear:

"In United States v. La Franca, [282 U. S.] 568, we holdthat, under $ 5 of the Willis-Campbell Act, a civil action

to recover taxes, which in fact are penalties, is punitivein character and barred by a prior conviction of the defendant for a criminal offense involving the same trans-actions. This, however, is not that case, but a proceeding in rem to forfeit property used in committing anoffense." Id., at 580.

Had the Court in Various Items found that a civil forfeit-ure could constitute a "punishment" under the Fifth Amendment, its holding would have been quite remarkable. Asthat Court recognized, "[a]t common law, in many cases, the
right of forfeiture did not attach until the offending personhad been convicted and the record of conviction produced."
Ibid. In other words, at common law, not only was it thecase that a criminal conviction did not

bar a civil forfeiture,but, in fact, the civil forfeiture could not be instituted unless

a criminal conviction had already been obtained. Thoughthis Court had held that common-law rule inapplicable where

518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT
276 UNITED STATES v. URSERY

Opinion of the Court
the right of forfeiture was "created by statute, in rem, cogni-zable on the revenue side of the exchequer,"

The Palmyra,
supra, at 14, it never had suggested that the Constitution
prohibited for statutory civil forfeiture what was required
for common-law civil forfeiture. For the Various Items
Court to have held that the forfeiture was prohibited by theprior criminal proceeding would have been directly contrary

to the common-law rule, and would have called into questionthe constitutionality of forfeiture statutes thought constitutional for over a century. See United States v. CurtissWright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 327-328 (1936) (Evidence
of a longstanding legislative practice "goes a long way in the
direction of proving the presence of unassailable ground for
the constitutionality of the practice").

Following its decision in Various Items, the Court did not
consider another double jeopardy case involving a civil forfeiture for 40 years. Then, in One Lot Emerald Cut Stones
v. United States, 409 U. S. 232 (1972) (per curiam), the
Court's brief opinion reaffirmed the rule of Various Items.
In Emerald Cut Stones, after having been acquitted of
smuggling jewels into the United States, the owner of the
jewels intervened in a proceeding to forfeit them as contraband. We rejected the owner's double jeopardy challenge
to the forfeiture, holding that "[i]f for no other reason, the
forfeiture is not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the
Fifth Amendment because it involves neither two criminal
trials nor two criminal punishments." 409 U. S., at 235.
Noting that the forfeiture provisions had been codified separately from parallel criminal provisions, the Court determined that the forfeiture clearly was "a civil sanction." Id.,
at 236. The forfeitures were not criminal punishments because they did not impose a second in personam penalty for
the criminal defendant's wrongdoing.

In our most recent decision considering whether a civil
forfeiture constitutes punishment under the Double Jeopardy
Clause, we again affirmed the rule of Various Items. In

518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT

277Cite as: 518 U. S. 267 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S.354 (1984), the owner of the defendant weapons was acquitted of charges of dealing firearms without a license. TheGovernment then brought a forfeiture action against the
firearms under 18 U. S. C. $ 924(d), alleging that they were
used or were intended to be used in violation of federal law.In another unanimous decision, we held that the forfeiture

was not barred by the prior criminal proceeding. We beganour analysis by stating the rule for our decision:

"Unless the forfeiture sanction was intended as punishment, so that the proceeding is essentially criminal in
character, the Double Jeopardy Clause is not applicable.The question, then, is whether a $ 924(d) forfeiture proceeding is intended to be, or by its nature necessarily is,criminal and punitive, or civil and remedial."

89 Firearms, supra, at 362 (citations omitted).

Our inquiry proceeded in two stages. In the first stage,
we looked to Congress' intent, and concluded that "Congressdesigned forfeiture under $ 924(d) as a remedial civil sanction." 465 U. S., at 363. This conclusion was based uponseveral findings. First, noting that the forfeiture proceeding was in rem, we found it significant that "[a]ctions in remhave traditionally been viewed as civil proceedings, with
jurisdiction dependent upon seizure of a physical object."
Ibid., citing Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416U. S., at 684. Second, we found that the forfeiture provision,

because it reached both weapons used in violation of federallaw and those "intended to be used" in such a manner,
reached a broader range of conduct than its criminal analog.
Third, we concluded that the civil forfeiture "further[ed]
broad remedial aims," including both "discouraging unregulated commerce in firearms" and "removing from circulation firearms that have been used or intended for use outside
regulated channels of commerce." 89 Firearms, supra, at
364.

518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT
278 UNITED STATES v. URSERY

Opinion of the Court
In the second stage of our analysis, we looked to " `whether
the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or
effect as to negate' Congress' intention to establish a civil
remedial mechanism," 465 U. S., at 365, quoting United
States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248-249 (1980). Considering
several factors that we had used previously in order to determine whether a civil proceeding was so punitive as to require
application of the full panoply of constitutional protections
required in a criminal trial, see id., at 248, we found only one
of those factors to be present in the $ 924(d) forfeiture. By
itself, however, the fact that the behavior proscribed by the
forfeiture was already a crime proved insufficient to turn the
forfeiture into a punishment subject to the Double Jeopardy
Clause. Hence, we found that the gun owner had "failed to
establish by the `clearest proof ' that Congress has provided
a sanction so punitive as to `transfor[m] what was clearly
intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.' " 89
Firearms, supra, at 366, quoting Rex Trailer Co. v. United
States, 350 U. S. 148, 154 (1956). We concluded our decision
by restating that civil forfeiture is "not an additional penalty
for the commission of a criminal act, but rather is a separate
civil sanction, remedial in nature." 89 Firearms, supra,
at 366.

B

Our cases reviewing civil forfeitures under the Double
Jeopardy Clause adhere to a remarkably consistent theme.
Though the two-part analytical construct employed in 89
Firearms was more refined, perhaps, than that we had used
over 50 years earlier in Various Items, the conclusion was
the same in each case: In rem civil forfeiture is a remedial
civil sanction, distinct from potentially punitive in personam
civil penalties such as fines, and does not constitute a punishment under the Double Jeopardy Clause. See Gore v.

United States, 357 U. S. 386, 392 (1958) ("In applying a provision like that of double jeopardy, which is rooted in history

518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT

279Cite as: 518 U. S. 267 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
and is not an evolving concept . . . , a long course of adjudica-tion in this Court carries impressive authority").

In the cases that we currently review, the Court of Ap-peals for the Ninth Circuit recognized as much, concluding
that after 89 Firearms, "the law was clear that civil forfeitures did not constitute `punishment' for double jeopardy pur-poses." 33 F. 3d, at 1218. Nevertheless, that court read

three of our decisions to have "abandoned" 89 Firearms andthe oft-affirmed rule of

Various Items. According to the
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, through our decisionsin

United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435 (1989), Austin v.
United States, 509 U. S. 602 (1993), and Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. 767 (1994), we
"changed [our] collective mind," and "adopted a new test for
determining whether a nominally civil sanction constitutes
`punishment' for double jeopardy purposes." 33 F. 3d, at
1218-1219. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
shared the view of the Ninth Circuit, though it did not directly rely upon Kurth Ranch. We turn now to consider
whether Halper, Austin, and Kurth Ranch accomplished the
radical jurisprudential shift perceived by the Courts of
Appeals.

In Halper, we considered "whether and under what circumstances a civil penalty may constitute `punishment' for
the purposes of double jeopardy analysis." Halper, supra,
at 436. Based upon his submission of 65 inflated Medicare
claims, each of which overcharged the Government by $9,
Halper was criminally convicted of 65 counts of violating the
false-claims statute, 18 U. S. C. $ 287 (1982 ed.), as well as of
16 counts of mail fraud, and was sentenced to two years in
prison and fined $5,000. Following that criminal conviction,
the Government successfully brought a civil action against
Halper under 31 U. S. C. $ 3729 (1982 ed. and Supp. II). The
District Court hearing the civil action determined that
Halper was liable to the Government for over $130,000 under

$ 3729, which then provided for liability in the amount of

518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT
280 UNITED STATES v. URSERY

Opinion of the Court
$2,000 per violation, double the Government's actual dam-ages, and court costs. The court concluded that imposing

the full civil penalty would constitute a second punishmentfor Halper's already-punished criminal offense, however, and
therefore reduced Halper's liability to double the actual damages suffered by the Government and the costs of the civilaction. The Government directly appealed that decision to

this Court.This Court agreed with the District Court's analysis. We
determined that our precedent had established no absoluteand irrebuttable rule that a civil fine cannot be "punishment"
under the Double Jeopardy Clause. Though it was well established that "a civil remedy does not rise to the level of
`punishment' merely because Congress provided for civil recovery in excess of the Government's actual damages," we
found that our case law did "not foreclose the possibility that
in a particular case a civil penalty . . . may be so extreme and
so divorced from the Government's damages and expenses as
to constitute punishment." 490 U. S., at 442. Emphasizing
the case-specific nature of our inquiry, id., at 448, we compared the size of the fine imposed on Halper, $130,000, to the
damages actually suffered by the Government as a result of
Halper's actions, estimated by the District Court at $585.
Noting that the fine was more than 220 times greater than
the Government's damages, we agreed with the District
Court that "Halper's $130,000 liability is sufficiently disproportionate that the sanction constitutes a second punishment
in violation of double jeopardy." Id., at 452. We remanded
to the District Court so that it could hear evidence regarding
the Government's actual damages, and could then reduce
Halper's liability to a nonpunitive level. Ibid.

In Austin, we considered whether a civil forfeiture could
violate the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, which provides that "[e]xcessive
bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed . . . ."
Aware that Austin had sold two grams of cocaine the pre518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT

281Cite as: 518 U. S. 267 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
vious day, police searched his mobile home and body shop.Their search revealed small amounts of marijuana and cocaine, a handgun, drug paraphernalia, and almost $5,000 incash. Austin was charged with one count of possessing
cocaine with intent to distribute, to which he pleaded guilty.
The Government then initiated a civil forfeiture proceedingagainst Austin's mobile home and auto shop, contending that

they had been "used" or were "intended for use" in the com-mission of a drug offense. See 21 U. S. C. $$ 881(a)(4) and
(a)(7). Austin contested the forfeiture on the ground of theExcessive Fines Clause, but the District Court and the
Court of Appeals held the forfeiture constitutional.

We limited our review to the question "whether the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment applies to forfeitures of property under 21 U. S. C. $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7)."
Austin, supra, at 604. We began our analysis by rejecting
the argument that the Excessive Fines Clause was limited
solely to criminal proceedings: The relevant question was not
whether a particular proceeding was criminal or civil, we
determined, but rather was whether forfeiture under $$ 881
(a)(4) and (a)(7) constituted "punishment" for the purposes of
the Eighth Amendment. Austin, supra, at 610. In an effort to answer that question, we briefly reviewed the history
of civil forfeiture both in this country and in England, see
509 U. S., at 611-618, taking a categorical approach that contrasted sharply with Halper's case-specific approach to determining whether a civil penalty constitutes punishment.
Ultimately, we concluded that "forfeiture under [$$ 881(a)(4)
and (a)(7)] constitutes `payment to a sovereign as punishment
for some offense,' and, as such, is subject to the limitations
of the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause." 509
U. S., at 622 (citation omitted).

In Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch,
supra, we considered whether a state tax imposed on marijuana was invalid under the Double Jeopardy Clause when
the taxpayer had already been criminally convicted of own518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT
282 UNITED STATES v. URSERY

Opinion of the Court
ing the marijuana that was taxed. We first established thatthe fact that Montana had labeled the civil sanction a "tax"

did not end our analysis. We then turned to considerwhether the tax was so punitive as to constitute a punishment subject to the Double Jeopardy Clause. Several dif-ferences between the marijuana tax imposed by Montana
and the typical revenue-raising tax were readily apparent.The Montana tax was unique in that it was conditioned on
the commission of a crime and was imposed only after thetaxpayer had been arrested: Thus, only a person charged
with a criminal offense was subject to the tax. We alsonoted that the taxpayer did not own or possess the taxed
marijuana at the time that the tax was imposed. Fromthese differences, we determined that the tax was motivated
by a " `penal and prohibitory intent rather than the gatheringof revenue.' " Id., at 781. Concluding that the Montana tax
proceeding "was the functional equivalent of a successivecriminal prosecution," we affirmed the Court of Appeals'
judgment barring the tax. Id., at 784.We think that the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit misread
Halper, Austin, and Kurth Ranch. None of those decisionspurported to overrule the well-established teaching of Various Items, Emerald Cut Stones, and 89 Firearms. Halperinvolved not a civil forfeiture, but a civil penalty. That its
rule was limited to the latter context is clear from the deci-sion itself, from the historical distinction that we have drawn
between civil forfeiture and civil penalties, and from thepractical difficulty of applying

Halper to a civil forfeiture.In Halper, we emphasized that our decision was limited to

the context of civil penalties:

"What we announce now is a rule for the rare case, thecase such as the one before us, where

a fixed-penaltyprovision subjects a prolific but small-gauge offender to

a sanction overwhelmingly disproportionate to the dam-ages he has caused. The rule is one of reason: Where a

Opinion of the Court
defendant previously has sustained a criminal penaltyand the civil penalty sought in the subsequent proceeding bears no rational relation to the goal of compensat-ing the Government for its loss, but rather appears to
qualify as `punishment' in the plain meaning of the word,then the defendant is entitled to an accounting of the
Government's damages and costs to determine if thepenalty sought in fact constitutes a second punishment."
490 U. S., at 449-450 (emphasis added).
The narrow focus of Halper followed from the distinctionthat we have drawn historically between civil forfeiture and

civil penalties. Since at least Various Items, we have dis-tinguished civil penalties such as fines from civil forfeiture
proceedings that are in rem. While a "civil action to re-cover . . . penaltie[s] is punitive in character," and much like
a criminal prosecution in that "it is the wrongdoer in personwho is proceeded against . . . and punished," in an

in remforfeiture proceeding, "[i]t is the property which is proceeded against, and by resort to a legal fiction, held guiltyand condemned." Various Items, 282 U. S., at 580-581.
Thus, though for double jeopardy purposes we have neverbalanced the value of property forfeited in a particular case
against the harm suffered by the Government in that case,we have balanced the size of a particular civil penalty against
the Government's harm. See, e. g., Rex Trailer Co. v.
United States, 350 U. S., at 154 (fines not "so unreasonableor excessive" as to transform a civil remedy into a criminal

penalty); United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537(1943) (fine of $315,000 not so disproportionate to Government's harm of $101,500 as to transform the fine into punish-ment). Indeed, the rule set forth in

Halper developed fromthe teaching of Rex Trailer and Hess. See Halper, supra,

at 445-447.It is difficult to see how the rule of Halper could be applied
to a civil forfeiture. Civil penalties are designed as a roughform of "liquidated damages" for the harms suffered by the

284 UNITED STATES v. URSERY

Opinion of the Court
Government as a result of a defendant's conduct. See RexTrailer, supra, at 153-154. The civil penalty involved in

Halper, for example, provided for a fixed monetary penaltyfor each false claim count on which the defendant was convicted in the criminal proceeding. Whether a "fixed-penaltyprovision" that seeks to compensate the Government for
harm it has suffered is "so extreme" and "so divorced" fromthe penalty's nonpunitive purpose of compensating the Government as to be a punishment may be determined by bal-ancing the Government's harm against the size of the penalty. Civil forfeitures, in contrast to civil penalties, aredesigned to do more than simply compensate the Government. Forfeitures serve a variety of purposes, but are de-signed primarily to confiscate property used in violation of
the law, and to require disgorgement of the fruits of illegalconduct. Though it may be possible to quantify the value of
the property forfeited, it is virtually impossible to quantify,even approximately, the nonpunitive purposes served by a
particular civil forfeiture. Hence, it is practically difficult to
determine whether a particular forfeiture bears no rationalrelationship to the nonpunitive purposes of that forfeiture.

Quite simply, the case-by-case balancing test set forth in
Halper, in which a court must compare the harm suffered by
the Government against the size of the penalty imposed, isinapplicable to civil forfeiture.

2 Justice Stevens' dissent is grounded in the different interpretation
that he gives Halper. He finds that Halper announced "two different
rules": a general rule, applicable to all civil sanctions, useful for determining whether a sanction is "of a punitive character"; and a "narrower rule,"
similar to our understanding of the case, that requires "an accounting of
the Government's damages and costs." Post, at 308. Justice Stevens
faults us in these cases for failing to apply the "general rule" of Halper.

The problem with Justice Stevens' interpretation of Halper, of
course, and therefore with his entire argument, is that Halper did not
announce two rules. Nowhere in Halper does the Court set forth two
distinct rules or purport to apply a two-step analysis. Justice Stevens
finds his "general rule" in a dictum from Halper: " `[A] civil sanction that

285Cite as: 518 U. S. 267 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
We recognized as much in Kurth Ranch. In that case, theCourt expressly disclaimed reliance upon Halper, finding

that its case-specific approach was impossible to apply out-side the context of a fixed civil-penalty provision. Reviewing the Montana marijuana tax, we held that because "tax
cannot fairly be said solely to serve a remedial purpose, but rather can
only be explained as also serving either retributive or deterrent purposes,
is punishment.' " Post, at 306, quoting United States v. Halper, 490 U. S.
435, 448 (1989). But the discussion immediately following that dictum
makes clear that it states not a new and separate test for whether a sanction is a punishment, but rather only a rephrasing of Justice Stevens'
"narrower" rule, i. e., the rule requiring an "accounting of the Government's damages and costs." Id., at 449.

"We therefore hold that under the Double Jeopardy Clause a defendant
who already has been punished . . . may not be subjected to an additional
civil sanction to the extent that the second sanction may not fairly be
characterized as remedial, but only as a deterrent or retribution.

"We acknowledge that this inquiry will not be an exact pursuit. In our
decided cases we have noted that the precise amount of the Government's
damages and costs may prove to be difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain.
. . . [I]t would be difficult if not impossible in many cases for a court to
determine the precise dollar figure at which a civil sanction has accomplished its remedial purpose of making the Government whole, but beyond
which the sanction takes on the quality of punishment." Id., at 448-449
(emphasis added); see also id., at 449-451.

The "general rule" discovered by Justice Stevens in Halper would
supplant, not mimic, see post, at 306, the rule of United States v. One
Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S. 354 (1984), and One Lot Emerald
Cut Stones v. United States, 409 U. S. 232 (1972). Whether a particular
sanction "cannot fairly be said solely to serve a remedial purpose" is an
inquiry radically different from that we have traditionally employed in
order to determine whether, as a categorical matter, a civil sanction is
subject to the Double Jeopardy Clause. Yet nowhere in Halper does the
Court purport to make such a sweeping change in the law, instead emphasizing repeatedly the narrow scope of its decision. Halper, supra, at 449
(announcing rule for "the rare case"). If the "general rule" of Justice
Stevens were applied literally, then virtually every sanction would be
declared to be a punishment: It is hard to imagine a sanction that has no
punitive aspect whatsoever. Justice Stevens' interpretation of Halper
is both contrary to the decision itself and would create an unworkable rule
inconsistent with well-established precedent.

Opinion of the Court
statutes serve a purpose quite different from civil penalties,
. . . Halper's method of determining whether the exaction
was remedial or punitive simply does not work in the case
of a tax statute." Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S., at 784 (internal
quotation marks omitted); see also id., at 786 (Rehnquist,
C. J., dissenting) (Halper inapplicable outside of " `fixedpenalty provision[s]' " that are meant "to recover the costs
incurred by the Government for bringing someone to book
for some violation of law"). This is not to say that there
is no occasion for analysis of the Government's harm. 89
Firearms makes clear the relevance of an evaluation of the
harms alleged. The point is simply that Halper's casespecific approach is inapplicable to civil forfeitures.

In the cases that we review, the Courts of Appeals did not
find Halper difficult to apply to civil forfeiture because they
concluded that its case-by-case balancing approach had been
supplanted in Austin by a categorical approach that found a
civil sanction to be punitive if it could not "fairly be said
solely to serve a remedial purpose." See Austin, 509 U. S.,
at 610; see also Halper, 490 U. S., at 448. But Austin, it
must be remembered, did not involve the Double Jeopardy
Clause at all. Austin was decided solely under the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment, a constitutional
provision which we never have understood as parallel to, or
even related to, the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth
Amendment. The only discussion of the Double Jeopardy
Clause contained in Austin appears in a footnote that acknowledges our decisions holding that "[t]he Double Jeopardy Clause has been held not to apply in civil forfeiture
proceedings . . . where the forfeiture could properly be characterized as remedial." Austin, supra, at 608, n. 4. And in
Austin we expressly recognized and approved our decisions
in One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, 409 U. S.
232 (1972), and United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S. 354 (1984). See Austin, supra, at 608, n. 4.

287Cite as: 518 U. S. 267 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
We acknowledged in Austin that our categorical approachunder the Excessive Fines Clause was wholly distinct from

the case-by-case approach of Halper, and we explained thatthe difference in approach was based in a significant difference between the purposes of our analysis under each constitutional provision. See Austin, supra, at 622, n. 14. It isunnecessary in a case under the Excessive Fines Clause to

inquire at a preliminary stage whether the civil sanction im-posed in that particular case is totally inconsistent with any
remedial goal. Because the second stage of inquiry underthe Excessive Fines Clause asks whether the particular
sanction in question is so large as to be "excessive," see Austin, 509 U. S., at 622-623 (declining to establish criteria for
excessiveness), a preliminary-stage inquiry that focused on
the disproportionality of a particular sanction would be duplicative of the excessiveness analysis that would follow.
See id., at 622, n. 14 ("[I]t appears to make little practical
difference whether the Excessive Fines Clause applies to all
forfeitures . . . or only to those that cannot be characterized
as purely remedial," because the Excessive Fines Clause
"prohibits only the imposition of `excessive' fines, and a fine
that serves purely remedial purposes cannot be considered
`excessive' in any event"). Forfeitures effected under 21
U. S. C. $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) are subject to review for excessiveness under the Eighth Amendment after Austin; this
does not mean, however, that those forfeitures are so punitive as to constitute punishment for the purposes of double
jeopardy. The holding of Austin was limited to the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment, and we decline
to import the analysis of Austin into our double jeopardy
jurisprudence.

In sum, nothing in Halper, Kurth Ranch, or Austin purported to replace our traditional understanding that civil forfeiture does not constitute punishment for the purpose of the
Double Jeopardy Clause. Congress long has authorized the
Government to bring parallel criminal proceedings and civil

Opinion of the Court
forfeiture proceedings, and this Court consistently has foundcivil forfeitures not to constitute punishment under the Double Jeopardy Clause. It would have been quite remarkablefor this Court both to have held unconstitutional a wellestablished practice, and to have overruled a long line ofprecedent, without having even suggested that it was doing
so. Halper dealt with in personam civil penalties under theDouble Jeopardy Clause;

Kurth Ranch with a tax proceedingunder the Double Jeopardy Clause; and Austin with civil forfeitures under the Excessive Fines Clause. None of thosecases dealt with the subject of these cases: in rem civil forfeitures for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

C
We turn now to consider the forfeitures in these casesunder the teaching of

Various Items, Emerald Cut Stones,and
89 Firearms. Because it provides a useful analyticaltool, we conduct our inquiry within the framework of the

two-part test used in 89 Firearms. First, we ask whetherCongress intended proceedings under 21 U. S. C. $ 881 and
18 U. S. C. $ 981 to be criminal or civil. Second, we turn toconsider whether the proceedings are so punitive in fact as
to "persuade us that the forfeiture proceeding[s] may not le-gitimately be viewed as civil in nature," despite Congress'
intent. 465 U. S., at 366.There is little doubt that Congress intended these forfeitures to be civil proceedings. As was the case in 89 Firearms, "Congress' intent in this regard is most clearly demon-strated by the procedural mechanisms it established for

enforcing forfeitures under the statute[s]." Id., at 363.Both 21 U. S. C. $ 881 and 18 U. S. C. $ 981, which is entitled
"Civil forfeiture," provide that the laws "relating to the sei-zure, summary and judicial forfeiture, and condemnation of
property for violation of the customs laws . . . shall applyto seizures and forfeitures incurred" under $$ 881 and 981.
See 21 U. S. C. $ 881(d); 18 U. S. C. $ 981(d). Because forfeit518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ure proceedings under the customs laws are in rem, see 19U. S. C. $ 1602 et seq., it is clear that Congress intended that

a forfeiture under $ 881 or $ 981, like the forfeiture reviewedin 89 Firearms, would be a proceeding in rem. Congress
specifically structured these forfeitures to be impersonal bytargeting the property itself. "In contrast to the

in perso-nam nature of criminal actions, actions in rem have traditionally been viewed as civil proceedings, with jurisdictiondependent upon seizure of a physical object." 89 Firearms,
supra, at 363, citing Calero-Toledo, 416 U. S., at 684.Other procedural mechanisms governing forfeitures under

$$ 881 and 981 also indicate that Congress intended such pro-ceedings to be civil. Forfeitures under either statute are
governed by 19 U. S. C. $ 1607, which provides that actualnotice of the impending forfeiture is unnecessary when the
Government cannot identify any party with an interest inthe seized article, and by $ 1609, which provides that seized
property is subject to forfeiture through a summary adminis-trative procedure if no party files a claim to the property.
And 19 U. S. C. $ 1615, which governs the burden of proof inforfeiture proceedings under $$ 881 and 981, provides that
once the Government has shown probable cause that theproperty is subject to forfeiture, then "the burden of proof
shall lie upon [the] claimant." In sum, "[b]y creating suchdistinctly civil procedures for forfeitures under [$$ 881 and
981], Congress has `indicate[d] clearly that it intended a civil,not a criminal sanction.' "

89 Firearms, supra, at 363, quot-ing Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391, 402 (1938).

3 Justice Stevens mischaracterizes our holding. We do not hold that
in rem civil forfeiture is per se exempt from the scope of the Double Jeopardy Clause. See post, at 300-305. Similarly, we do not rest our conclusion in these cases upon the long-recognized fiction that a forfeiture in
rem punishes only malfeasant property rather than a particular person.
See post, at 313-316. That a forfeiture is designated as civil by Congress
and proceeds in rem establishes a presumption that it is not subject to
double jeopardy. See, e. g., 89 Firearms, 465 U. S., at 363. Nevertheless,
where the "clearest proof" indicates that an in rem civil forfeiture is "so

290 UNITED STATES v. URSERY

Opinion of the Court
Moving to the second stage of our analysis, we find thatthere is little evidence, much less the " `clearest proof ' " that

we require, see 89 Firearms, supra, at 365, quoting Ward,448 U. S., at 249, suggesting that forfeiture proceedings
under 21 U. S. C. $$ 881(a)(6) and (a)(7), and 18 U. S. C.$ 981(a)(1)(A), are so punitive in form and effect as to render
them criminal despite Congress' intent to the contrary. Thestatutes involved in these cases are, in most significant respects, indistinguishable from those reviewed, and held notto be punitive, in

Various Items, Emerald Cut Stones, and89 Firearms.

Most significant is that $ 981(a)(1)(A) and $$ 881(a)(6) and(a)(7), while perhaps having certain punitive aspects, serve
important nonpunitive goals. Title 21 U. S. C. $ 881(a)(7),under which Ursery's property was forfeited, provides for
the forfeiture of "all real property . . . which is used or in-tended to be used, in any manner or part, to commit, or to
facilitate the commission of " a federal drug felony. Requir-ing the forfeiture of property used to commit federal narcotics violations encourages property owners to take care inmanaging their property and ensures that they will not permit that property to be used for illegal purposes. See Ben-nis v. Michigan, 516 U. S. 442, 452 (1996) ("Forfeiture of
property prevents illegal uses . . . by imposing an economicpenalty, thereby rendering illegal behavior unprofitable"); 89
Firearms, supra, at 364 (forfeiture "discourages unregulatedcommerce in firearms");

Calero-Toledo, supra, at 687-688.In many circumstances, the forfeiture may abate a nuisance.

See, e. g., United States v. 141st Street Corp., 911 F. 2d 870(CA2 1990) (forfeiting apartment building used to sell crack
cocaine); see also Bennis, supra, at 452 (affirming applicationof Michigan statute abating car as a nuisance; forfeiture "prevent[s] further illicit use of " property); cf. 89 Firearms, 465
punitive either in purpose or effect" as to be equivalent to a criminal
proceeding, that forfeiture may be subject to the Double Jeopardy Clause.
Id., at 365.

Opinion of the Court
U. S., at 364 (forfeiture "remov[ed] from circulation firearmsthat have been used or intended for use" illegally);

Emerald
Cut Stones, 409 U. S., at 237 (forfeiture "prevented forbiddenmerchandise from circulating in the United States").

The forfeiture of the property claimed by Arlt and Wren
took place pursuant to 18 U. S. C. $ 981(a)(1)(A) and 21U. S. C. $ 881(a)(6). Section 981(a)(1)(A) provides for the

forfeiture of "[a]ny property" involved in illegal money-laundering transactions. Section 881(a)(6) provides for the
forfeiture of "[a]ll . . . things of value furnished or intendedto be furnished by any person in exchange for" illegal drugs;
"all proceeds traceable to such an exchange"; and "all moneys, negotiable instruments, and securities used or intended
to be used to facilitate" a federal drug felony. The same
remedial purposes served by $ 881(a)(7) are served by

$$ 881(a)(6) and 981(a)(1)(A). Only one point merits separate discussion. To the extent that $ 881(a)(6) applies to
"proceeds" of illegal drug activity, it serves the additional
nonpunitive goal of ensuring that persons do not profit from
their illegal acts.

Other considerations that we have found relevant to the
question whether a proceeding is criminal also tend to support a conclusion that $ 981(a)(1)(A) and $$ 881(a)(6) and (a)(7)
are civil proceedings. See Ward, supra, at 247-248, n. 7, 249
(listing relevant factors and noting that they are neither exhaustive nor dispositive). First, in light of our decisions in
Various Items, Emerald Cut Stones, and 89 Firearms, and
the long tradition of federal statutes providing for a forfeiture proceeding following a criminal prosecution, it is absolutely clear that in rem civil forfeiture has not historically
been regarded as punishment, as we have understood that
term under the Double Jeopardy Clause. Second, there is
no requirement in the statutes that we currently review that
the Government demonstrate scienter in order to establish
that the property is subject to forfeiture; indeed, the property may be subject to forfeiture even if no party files a

claim to it and the Government never shows any connec-tion between the property and a particular person. See 19

U. S. C. $ 1609. Though both $$ 881(a) and 981(a) contain an"innocent owner" exception, we do not think that such a provision, without more indication of an intent to punish, is rele-vant to the question whether a statute is punitive under the
Double Jeopardy Clause. Third, though both statutes mayfairly be said to serve the purpose of deterrence, we long
have held that this purpose may serve civil as well as crimi-nal goals. See,

e. g., 89 Firearms, supra, at 364; Calero-Toledo, 416 U. S., at 677-678. We recently reaffirmed this

conclusion in Bennis v. Michigan, supra, at 452, where weheld that "forfeiture . . . serves a deterrent purpose distinct from any punitive purpose." Finally, though bothstatutes are tied to criminal activity, as was the case in
89 Firearms, this fact is insufficient to render the statutespunitive. See

89 Firearms, supra, at 365-366. It is wellsettled that "Congress may impose both a criminal and a civil

sanction in respect to the same act or omission," Helvering,303 U. S., at 399. By itself, the fact that a forfeiture statute
has some connection to a criminal violation is far from
the "clearest proof " necessary to show that a proceeding iscriminal.

We hold that these in rem civil forfeitures are neither"punishment" nor criminal for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The judgments of the Court of Appeals for theSixth Circuit, in No. 95-345, and of the Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit, in No. 95-346, are, accordingly, reversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Kennedy, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion and add these further
observations.In

Austin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602, 619-622 (1993),
we described the civil in rem forfeiture provision of 21U. S. C. $ 881(a)(7) at issue here as punitive. In

Libretti v.

$ 853, which in almost identical terms provides for criminal
forfeiture of property involved in or derived from drug
crimes. We held that the "fundamental nature of criminal
forfeiture" is punishment. 516 U. S., at 41. Today the
Court holds that the civil in rem forfeitures here are not
punishment implicating the protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause. Ante, at 292. I write to explain why, in my
view, our holding is consistent with both Austin and Libretti.

The Fifth Amendment provides that no person shall "be
subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of
life or limb." U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. We have interpreted
the Double Jeopardy Clause to "protec[t] against a second
prosecution for the same offense after acquittal, against a
second prosecution for the same offense after conviction, and
against multiple punishments for the same offense." Justices of Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon, 466 U. S. 294,
306-307 (1984); Jones v. Thomas, 491 U. S. 376, 380-381
(1989).

Although there is language in our cases to the contrary,
see One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania, 380 U. S.
693, 700 (1965); Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 634
(1886), civil in rem forfeiture is not punishment of the wrongdoer for his criminal offense. We made this clear in Various
Items of Personal Property v. United States, 282 U. S. 577
(1931), which the Court is right to deem the seminal case in
this area, ante, at 274.

"[This] forfeiture proceeding . . . is in rem. It is the
property which is proceeded against, and, by resort to a
legal fiction, held guilty and condemned as though it
were conscious instead of inanimate and insentient. In
a criminal prosecution it is the wrongdoer in person who
is proceeded against, convicted and punished. The forfeiture is no part of the punishment for the criminal offense. The provision of the Fifth Amendment to the
Constitution in respect of double jeopardy does not
apply." 282 U. S., at 581 (citations omitted).

Kennedy, J., concurring
Embracing the rule of Various Items, that the Double
Jeopardy Clause applies only to in personam punishments of
the wrongdoer and not in rem forfeitures, does not imply
that forfeiture inflicts no punishment. Though I have expressed my doubts about the view expressed in Austin, 509
U. S., at 611-618, that throughout history forfeitures have
been intended to punish blameworthy owners, id., at 629
(opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment);
Bennis v. Michigan, 516 U. S. 442, 472-473 (1996) (dissenting
opinion), I did not there question the punitive nature of

$ 881(a)(7), nor do I now. Under this statute, providing for
the forfeiture of real property used to facilitate a drug offense, only the culpable stand to lose their property; no interest of any owner is forfeited if he can show he did not know
of or consent to the crime. Ibid.

The key distinction is that the instrumentality-forfeiture
statutes are not directed at those who carry out the crimes,
but at owners who are culpable for the criminal misuse of the
property. See Austin, supra, at 619 (statutory "exemptions
serve to focus the provisions on the culpability of the
owner"). The theory is that the property, whether or not
illegal or dangerous in nature, is hazardous in the hands of
this owner because either he uses it to commit crimes, or
allows others to do so. The owner can be held accountable
for the misuse of the property. Cf. One 1958 Plymouth
Sedan, supra, at 699 ("There is nothing even remotely criminal in possessing an automobile. It is only the alleged use
to which this particular automobile was put that subjects
[the owner] to its possible loss"). The same rationale is at
work in the statutory provisions enabling forfeiture of currency "used or intended to be used" to facilitate a criminal
offense, $ 881(a)(6). See also 18 U. S. C. $ 981(a)(1)(A) (property involved in money-laundering transactions or attempts
in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 1956). Since the punishment befalls any propertyholder who cannot claim statutory inno518us2$79L 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT

cence, whether or not he committed any criminal acts, it isnot a punishment for a person's criminal wrongdoing.

Forfeiture, then, punishes an owner by taking propertyinvolved in a crime, and it may happen that the owner is also
the wrongdoer charged with a criminal offense. But the forfeiture is not a second in personam punishment for the of-fense, which is all the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits.

See ante, at 276 ("The forfeitures were not criminal punish-ments because they did not impose a second

in personam
penalty for the criminal defendant's wrongdoing"); One Lot
Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, 409 U. S. 232, 235
(1972) (per curiam) ("[T]he forfeiture is not barred by the
Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment because
it involves neither two criminal trials nor two criminal
punishments").

Civil in rem forfeiture has long been understood as independent of criminal punishments. In The Palmyra, 12
Wheat. 1 (1827), we rejected a claim that a libel in rem required a conviction for the criminal offense charged in the
libel. Distinguishing forfeitures of a felon's goods and chattels, which required proof of a conviction, we noted that the
statutory in rem "offence is attached primarily to the thing,"
and that often in rem forfeiture was imposed in the absence
of any in personam penalty. Id., at 14. Examining American and English statutes, we concluded: "[T]he practice has
been, and so this Court understand[s] the law to be, that the
proceeding in rem stands independent of, and wholly unaffected by any criminal proceeding in personam." Id., at 15.

Distinguishing between in rem and in personam punishments does not depend upon, or revive, the fiction alive in
Various Items, supra, at 581, but condemned in Austin,
supra, at 615, n. 9, that the property is punished as if it were
a sentient being capable of moral choice. It is the owner
who feels the pain and receives the stigma of the forfeiture,
not the property. See United States v. United States
Coin & Currency, 401 U. S. 715, 718 (1971). The distinction

Kennedy, J., concurring
simply recognizes that Congress, in order to quiet title toforfeitable property in one proceeding, has structured the

forfeiture action as a proceeding against the property, notagainst a particular defendant. Indeed, the Government
will often file a forfeiture complaint without any knowledge
of who the owner is. See ante, at 291-292. True, the for-feiture statutes require proof of a violation of a drug trafficking or other offense, but the purpose of this predicateshowing is just to establish that the property was used in
a crime. In contrast to criminal forfeiture, see 21 U. S. C.$ 853(a), civil

in rem forfeiture actions do not require a showing that the owner who stands to lose his property interest
has committed a criminal offense. See $ 881(a)(6) ("any violation of this subchapter"); $ 881(a)(7) ("a violation of this
subchapter"); 18 U. S. C. $ 981(a)(1)(A) ("a transaction or attempted transaction in violation of " $ 1956). The offenses
committed by Ursery, Arlt, and Wren were proffered as evidence that the property was used in a crime, but this does
not make forfeiture a punishment for those offenses. See
United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S.
354, 366 (1984) (civil forfeiture is "not an additional penalty
for the commission of a criminal act").

For this reason, Justice Stevens' attempt, post, at 317,
to rely on the same-elements test of Blockburger v. United
States, 284 U. S. 299, 304 (1932), is unavailing. Blockburger
is a misfit in this context; it compares the elements of two
offenses charged against a defendant. The forfeiture cause
of action is not charging a second offense of the person; it is a
proceeding against the property in which proof of a criminal
violation by any person will suffice, provided that some
knowledge of, or consent to, the crime on the part of the
property owner is also established.

In Part II-C of its opinion, the Court conducts the twopart inquiry established in 89 Firearms, supra, at 362-366,
as to whether, first, Congress intended the proceedings to be
civil, and, second, the forfeitures are so punitive as to be

criminal in nature and therefore subject to the Double Jeop-ardy Clause.

Ante, at 288. The test was imported by the
89 Firearms Court from cases involving civil in personampenalties. See 465 U. S., at 362 (citing

Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391, 398-399 (1938), and United States v. Ward,
448 U. S. 242, 248 (1980)). In the context of these cases andthe precedents bearing upon them, I am not sure the test

adds much to the clear rule of Various Items that civil in
rem forfeiture of property involved in a crime is not punishment subject to the Double Jeopardy Clause. As to the firstprong of the test, any

in rem proceeding is civil. As to the
second prong, so long as forfeiture hinges on the property'suse in a crime, there will always be the remedial purpose

the Court identifies of preventing property owners from
allowing their goods to be used for illegal purposes, ante, at290. I acknowledge

89 Firearms to be precedent, however,
and, because the Court's application of the test is consistent
with Various Items, I join its opinion in full.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,
concurring in the judgment.

In my view, the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits successive prosecution, not successive punishment. See Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. 767, 798
(1994) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Civil forfeiture proceedings
of the sort at issue here are not criminal prosecutions, even
under the standard of Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372
U. S. 144, 164 (1963), and United States v. Ward, 448 U. S.
242, 248-251 (1980).

Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment in part and
dissenting in part.

The question the Court poses is whether civil forfeitures
constitute "punishment" for purposes of the Double Jeopardy
Clause. Because the numerous federal statutes authorizing
forfeitures cover such a wide variety of situations, it is quite

298 UNITED STATES v. URSERY

Opinion of Stevens, J.
wrong to assume that there is only one answer to that ques-tion. For purposes of analysis it is useful to identify three

different categories of property that are subject to seizure:proceeds, contraband, and property that has played a part
in the commission of a crime. The facts of these two cases
illustrate the point.In No. 95-346 the Government has forfeited $405,089.23 in

currency. Those funds are the proceeds of unlawful activity.They are not property that respondents have any right to
retain. The forfeiture of such proceeds, like the confiscationof money stolen from a bank, does not punish respondents
because it exacts no price in liberty or lawfully derived property from them. I agree that the forfeiture of such proceeds
is not punitive and therefore I concur in the Court's disposition of No. 95-346.

None of the property seized in No. 95-345 constituted proceeds of illegal activity. Indeed, the facts of that case reveal
a dramatically different situation. Respondent Ursery cultivated marijuana in a heavily wooded area not far from his
home in Shiawassee County, Michigan. The illegal substance was consumed by members of his family, but there is
no evidence, and no contention by the Government, that he
sold any of it to third parties. Acting on the basis of the
incorrect assumption that the marijuana plants were on
respondent's property, Michigan police officers executed a
warrant to search the premises. In his house they found
marijuana seeds, stems, stalks, and a grow light. I presume
those items were seized, and I have no difficulty concluding
that such a seizure does not constitute punishment because
respondent had no right to possess contraband. Accordingly, I agree with the Court's opinion insofar as it explains
why the forfeiture of contraband does not constitute punishment for double jeopardy purposes.

The critical question presented in No. 95-345 arose, not
out of the seizure of contraband by the Michigan police, but
rather out of the decision by the United States attorney to

take respondent's home. There is no evidence that thehouse had been purchased with the proceeds of unlawful activity and the house itself was surely not contraband. None-theless, 21 U. S. C. $ 881(a)(7) authorized the Government to
seek forfeiture of respondent's residence because it had beenused to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of marijuana.1 Respondent was then himself prosecuted for andconvicted of manufacturing marijuana. In my opinion none
of the reasons supporting the forfeiture of proceeds or con-traband provides a sufficient basis for concluding that the
confiscation of respondent's home was not punitive.The Government has advanced four arguments in support
of its position that the forfeiture of respondent's home under$ 881(a)(7) followed by his prosecution under $ 841(a)(1) did
not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause: (1) the forfeiturewas not punitive; (2) even if punitive, it was not a "jeopardy";
(3) even if both the forfeiture and the prosecution were jeop-ardies, they were not based on the same offense under the

1 The contraband found on the premises was evidence that the building
had been used to facilitate the commission of a violation of Title 21 punishable by more than one year's imprisonment. To justify that forfeiture,
the Government assumed the burden of proving (a) that respondent had
committed such an offense, and (b) that the property had played some part
in it. The statute provides as follows:

"$ 881. Forfeitures
"(a) Subject property

"The following shall be subject to forfeiture to the United States and
no property right shall exist in them:. . . . .

"(7) All real property, including any right, title, and interest (including
any leasehold interest) in the whole of any lot or tract of land and any
appurtenances or improvements, which is used, or intended to be used, in
any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, a violation of this subchapter punishable by more than one year's imprisonment,
except that no property shall be forfeited under this paragraph, to the
extent of an interest of an owner, by reason of any act or omission established by that owner to have been committed or omitted without the
knowledge or consent of that owner." $ 881(a)(7).

rule of Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299 (1932);and (4) in all events, the two cases should be deemed to constitute a single proceeding for double jeopardy purposes.Because the Court addresses only the first of these arguments, I shall begin by explaining why both reason and prec-edent support the conclusion that the taking of respondent's
home was unmistakably punitive in character. I shall thencomment on the other three arguments.

I
In recent years, both Congress and the state legislatureshave armed their law enforcement authorities with new powers to forfeit property that vastly exceed their traditionaltools.

2 In response, this Court has reaffirmed the funda2 Justice Thomas has expressed his concern about both the unusual
scope and the novelty of the very statute used to carry out the forfeiture
in these cases:

"I am disturbed by the breadth of new civil forfeiture statutes such as 21
U. S. C. $ 881(a)(7), which subjects to forfeiture all real property that is
used, or intended to be used, in the commission, or even the facilitation,
of a federal drug offense. As Justice O'Connor points out, . . . since
the Civil War we have upheld statutes allowing for the civil forfeiture of
real property. A strong argument can be made, however, that $ 881(a)(7)
is so broad that it differs not only in degree, but in kind, from its historical
antecedents. . . . Indeed, it is unclear whether the central theory behind
in rem forfeiture, the fiction `that the thing is primarily considered the
offender,' J. W. Goldsmith, Jr.-Grant Co. v. United States, 254 U. S. 505,
511 (1921), can fully justify the immense scope of $ 881(a)(7). Under this
provision, `large tracts of land [and any improvements thereon] which have
no connection with crime other than being the location where a drug transaction occurred,' Brief for Respondents 20, are subject to forfeiture. It
is difficult to see how such real property is necessarily in any sense `guilty'
of an offense, as could reasonably be argued of, for example, the distillery
in Dobbins's Distillery v. United States, 96 U. S. 395 (1878), or the pirate
vessel in Harmony v. United States, 2 How. 210 (1844). Given that current practice under $ 881(a)(7) appears to be far removed from the legal
fiction upon which the civil forfeiture doctrine is based, it may be necessary--in an appropriate case--to reevaluate our generally deferential approach to legislative judgments in this area of civil forfeiture." United

mental proposition that all forfeitures must be accomplishedwithin the constraints set by the Constitution. See, e. g.,

Austin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602 (1993); United Statesv. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U. S. 43 (1993).
This Term the Court has begun dismantling the protectionsit so recently erected. In

Bennis v. Michigan, 516 U. S. 442(1996), the Court held that officials may confiscate an innocent person's automobile. And today, for the first time, itupholds the forfeiture of a person's home. On the way to its
surprising conclusion that the owner is not punished by theloss of his residence, the Court repeatedly professes its
adherence to tradition and time-honored practice. As I dis-cuss below, however, the decision shows a stunning disregard
not only for modern precedents but for our older ones aswell.

In the Court's view, the seminal case is Various Items of
Personal Property v. United States, 282 U. S. 577 (1931),which approved the forfeiture of an illegal distillery by resort to the "legal fiction" that the distillery rather than itsowner was being punished "as though it were conscious instead of inanimate and insentient." Id., at 581. Startingfrom that fanciful premise, the Court was able to conclude
that confiscating the property after the owner was prose-cuted for the underlying violations of the revenue laws did
not offend the Double Jeopardy Clause.According to the Court,

Various Items established a cate-gorical rule that the Double Jeopardy Clause was "inapplicable to civil forfeiture actions." Ante, at 274. The Courtasserts that this rule has received "remarkably consistent"
application and was "reaffirmed" by a pair of cases in 1972and 1984.

Ante, at 278, 276. In reality, however, shortlyafter its announcement, Various Items simply disappeared

from our jurisprudence. We cited that case in only twodecisions over the next seven years, and never again in

States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U. S. 43, 81-82 (1993)
(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part) (footnotes omitted).

nearly six decades. Neither of the two cases that sup-posedly "affirmed" Various Items--One Lot Emerald Cut

Stones v. United States, 409 U. S. 232 (1972) (per curiam),and United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465
U. S. 354 (1984)--even mentioned it.More important, neither of those cases endorsed the asserted categorical rule that civil forfeitures never give riseto double jeopardy rights. Instead, each carefully considered the nature of the particular forfeiture at issue, classi-fying it as either "punitive" or "remedial," before deciding whether it implicated double jeopardy. Emerald Cut
Stones concerned a customs statute that authorized confis-cation of certain merchandise, in that case jewelry, that had

been smuggled into the United States. The Court explainedthat the purpose of the statute was to remove such items
from circulation, and that the penalty amounted to a reason-able liquidated damages award to reimburse the Government
for the costs of enforcement and investigation. In thoserespects, therefore, it constituted a "remedial rather than
punitive sanctio[n]." 409 U. S., at 237. In 89 Firearms, theCourt explored in even greater detail the character of a federal statute that forfeited unregistered firearms. It rea-soned that the sanction "further[ed] broad remedial aims" in
preventing commerce in such weapons, and also covered abroader range of conduct than simply criminal behavior.
465 U. S., at 364. For those reasons, it was not properly
characterized as a punitive sanction.The majority, surprisingly, claims that

Austin v. United
States, 509 U. S. 602 (1993), "expressly recognized and ap-proved" those decisions.

Ante, at 286. But the Court creates the appearance that we endorsed its interpretation of
89 Firearms and Emerald Cut Stones by quoting selectively
from Austin. We actually stated the following:

"The Double Jeopardy Clause has been held not to
apply in civil forfeiture proceedings, but only in cases

518us2$79I 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT

303Cite as: 518 U. S. 267 (1996)
Opinion of Stevens, J.
where the forfeiture could properly be characterized asremedial. See United States v. One Assortment of 89

Firearms, 465 U. S. 354, 364 (1984); One Lot EmeraldCut Stones v. United States, 409 U. S. 232, 237 (1972);
see generally United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435,446-449 (1989) (Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits second sanction that may not fairly be characterized asremedial)." 509 U. S., at 608, n. 4 (emphasis added).

In reality, both cases rejected the monolithic view that all in
rem civil forfeitures should be treated the same, and recog-nized the possibility that other types of forfeitures that could

not "properly be characterized as remedial" might constitute"an additional penalty for the commission of a criminal act."
465 U. S., at 366.That possibility was not merely speculative. The Court
had already decided that other constitutional protections ap-plied to forfeitures that had a punitive element. In

Boydv. United States, 116 U. S. 616 (1886), the Court held that

compulsory production of an individual's private papers foruse in a proceeding to forfeit his property for alleged fraud
against the revenue laws violated both the Fourth Amend-ment and the Fifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause.
As the Court stated: "[P]roceedings instituted for the pur-pose of declaring the forfeiture of a man's property by reason
of offences committed by him, though they may be civil inform, are in their nature criminal" and thus give rise to these
constitutional safeguards. Id., at 634.We reaffirmed

Boyd twice during the span of time be-tween our decisions in Various Items and 89 Firearms. In

One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania, 380 U. S. 693(1965), the Court unanimously repeated

Boyd's conclusionthat "a forfeiture proceeding is quasi-criminal in character"

and "[i]ts object, like a criminal proceeding, is to penalize forthe commission of an offense against the law." The Court
therefore held that the Fourth Amendment applied to a pro518us2$79I 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT
304 UNITED STATES v. URSERY

Opinion of Stevens, J.
ceeding to forfeit an automobile used to transport illegally
manufactured liquor. 380 U. S., at 700.

Even more significant is United States v. United States
Coin & Currency, 401 U. S. 715 (1971), in which the Court
again held that the Fifth Amendment applied to forfeiture
proceedings. Coin & Currency involved the confiscation of
gambling money under a statute, quite similar to 21 U. S. C.

$ 881, providing that " `[i]t shall be unlawful to have or possess any property intended for use in violating the provisions
of the internal revenue laws . . . and no property rights shall
exist in any such property.' " 401 U. S., at 716 (quoting 26
U. S. C. $ 7302). The Court held that the Fifth Amendment
barred the Government's attempt to introduce evidence of
the defendant's failure to file required tax forms against him
in the forfeiture proceeding. Following Boyd, the Court explained that the form of the proceeding as civil or criminal
could not have any bearing on the rights that attached when
the sanction was a penalty. "From the relevant constitutional standpoint, there is no difference between a man who
`forfeits' $8,674 because he has used the money in illegal
gambling activities and a man who pays a `criminal fine' of
$8,674 as a result of the same course of conduct." 401 U. S.,
at 718. In each case, the Court reasoned, the liability derives from the same offense of the owner; hence, "the Fifth
Amendment applies with equal force." Ibid.

Emerald Cut Stones expressly recognized the continuing
validity of Coin & Currency and One 1958 Plymouth Sedan.
It distinguished the customs statute in that case because the
forfeiture did not depend on the fact of a criminal offense
or conviction. See 409 U. S., at 236, n. 6. See also United
States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 254 (1980) (discussing Boyd).
That recognition is critical. For whatever its connection to
the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment, the
Double Jeopardy Clause is part of the same Amendment as
the Self-Incrimination Clause, and ought to be interpreted

Opinion of Stevens, J.
in pari materia.3 By confining its holding to civil forfeit-ures fairly characterized as remedial, and by distinguishing

cases that had applied the Fifth Amendment to other typesof forfeitures, Emerald Cut Stones and 89 Firearms recognized the possibility that the Double Jeopardy Clause mightapply to certain punitive civil forfeiture proceedings. One
of the mysteries of the Court's opinion is that although itclaims that civil

in rem forfeiture cannot be understood aspunishment, it devotes Part II-C to examining the actual

purposes of the forfeiture in these cases and "proving" thatthey are not punitive. If the Court truly adhered to the
logic of its position, that entire section would be unnecessary.Read properly, therefore,

89 Firearms and Emerald CutStones are not inconsistent with, but set the stage for, the

modern understanding of how the Double Jeopardy Clauseapplies in nominally civil proceedings. That understanding
has been developed in a trio of recent decisions: UnitedStates v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435 (1989), Austin v. United
States, 509 U. S. 602 (1993), and Department of Revenue of
Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. 767 (1994). The Court ofAppeals found that the combined effect of two of those decisions--Halper and Austin--established the proposition thatforfeitures under 21 U. S. C. $ 881(a)(7) implicated double
jeopardy. This Court rejects that conclusion, asserting thatnone of these cases changed the "oft-affirmed rule" of Various Items. Ante, at 279.It is the majority, however, that has "misread"

Halper,Austin, and Kurth Ranch by artificially cabining each to a

separate sphere, see ante, at 288, and treating the three asif they concerned unrelated subjects. In fact, all three were
devoted to the common enterprise of giving meaning to theidea of "punishment," a concept that plays a central role in

3 If anything, the Double Jeopardy Clause ought to apply to a broader
set of proceedings than the Self-Incrimination Clause. While the latter
applies only in a "criminal case," the former concerns any type of "jeopardy," presumably a larger class of situations. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 5.

306 UNITED STATES v. URSERY

Opinion of Stevens, J.
the jurisprudence of both the Excessive Fines Clause andthe Double Jeopardy Clause.

Halper laid down a general
rule for applying the Double Jeopardy Clause to civilproceedings:

"[A] civil sanction that cannot fairly be said solely toserve a remedial purpose, but rather can only be explained as also serving either retributive or deterrentpurposes, is punishment, as we have come to understand
the term. . . . We therefore hold that under the DoubleJeopardy Clause a defendant who already has been punished in a criminal prosecution may not be subjected to
an additional civil sanction to the extent that the secondsanction may not fairly be characterized as remedial,

but only as a deterrent or retribution." 490 U. S., at448-449.

In the past seven years, we have applied that same rule tothree types of sanctions: civil penalties, civil forfeitures,
and taxes.The first was the subject of

Halper itself. The defendant
had been convicted for submitting 65 false claims for reim-bursement (seeking $12 for each, when the actual services

rendered entitled him to only $3) to a Medicare provider, andsentenced to imprisonment for two years and a $5,000 fine.
The Government then brought a civil action against him for
the same offenses. The penalty for violating the civil false-claims statute consisted of double the Government's damages

plus court costs and a fixed fine of $2,000 per false claim.See

id., at 438. Accordingly, the Government sought a penalty of $130,000, although the defendant's fraud had caused
an actual loss of only $585. Applying the definition of "punishment" given above, the Court first held that the fixed
$2,000 fine served a remedial purpose because it was designed to compensate the Government "roughly" for the
costs of law enforcement and investigation. Id., at 445.
Despite finding that the fine was not by nature punitive, the

307Cite as: 518 U. S. 267 (1996)
Opinion of Stevens, J.
Court went on to consider whether the sanction "as applied
in the individual case," id., at 448, amounted to punishment.
It answered that question in the affirmative, for the applied
sanction created a "tremendous disparity" with the amount
of harm the defendant actually caused. Id., at 452. The
Court explained that, as a rule, a fixed penalty that would
otherwise serve remedial ends could still punish the defendant if the imposed amount was out of all proportion to the
damage done.4

The second category of sanctions--civil forfeitures--was
the subject of Austin. In that case, the Government sought
to forfeit the petitioner's mobile home and auto body shop
as instrumentalities of the drug trade under 21 U. S. C.

$$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) because he had sold cocaine there.
Applying Halper's definition of punishment, see 509 U. S., at
610, 621, we held that $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) must be considered to qualify as such, partly because forfeitures have historically been understood as punishment and more importantly because no remedial purpose underlay the sanction
the statute created. Merely compensating the Government
for its costs, as in Halper, could not justify the forfeiture
scheme because "[t]he value of the conveyances and real
property forfeitable under $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) . . . can vary
so dramatically that any relationship between the Government's actual costs and the amount of the sanction is merely
coincidental." 509 U. S., at 622, n. 14. Accordingly, we held
that any forfeiture was subject to the constraints of the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment.

4 The Court stated the full rule as follows: "Where a defendant previously has sustained a criminal penalty and the civil penalty sought in
the subsequent proceeding bears no rational relation to the goal of compensating the Government for its loss, but rather appears to qualify as
`punishment' in the plain meaning of the word, then the defendant is entitled to an accounting of the Government's damages and costs to determine
if the penalty sought in fact constitutes a second punishment." United
States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 449-450 (1989).

308 UNITED STATES v. URSERY

Opinion of Stevens, J.
The Court expends a great deal of effort attempting todistinguish Austin away as purely an excessive fines case.

The Court states, for example, that it is "difficult to see" howone would apply the "rule of Halper" to a civil forfeiture
such as was present in Austin. Ante, at 283. But theCourt conflates the two different rules that

Halper an-nounced. As discussed above, Austin expressly quoted

Halper and followed its general rule that a sanction shouldbe characterized as "punishment" if it serves any punitive
end. See 509 U. S., at 610, 621. It relegated to a footnoteHalper's narrower rule--the one for the "rare case," which
requires an accounting of the Government's damages andcosts--because it had already decided that the statute was
of a punitive character. 509 U. S., at 622, n. 14. That ap-proach was perfectly appropriate. There is no need to determine whether a statute that is punitive by design has apunitive effect when applied in the individual case.

Halperis entirely consistent with Austin, because it determined

first that the sanction there generally did not have a punitivecharacter before it considered whether some applications
might be punitive nonetheless.5The majority implies that

Austin's "categorical approach"
is somehow suspect as an application of double jeopardyjurisprudence,

ante, at 286-287, but Kurth Ranch definitively refutes that suggestion. The sanction there was a taximposed on marijuana and applied to a taxpayer who had

already been prosecuted for ownership of the drugs sought
to be taxed. Again applying Halper's definition of punish-ment, see 511 U. S., at 779-780, we considered the nature of

the tax, focusing on several unusual features that distin-guished it from ordinary revenue-raising provisions, and con5 Even if Austin had not followed Halper's rule for defining punishment,
it would make little sense to say that forfeiture might be punishment "for
the purposes of" the Excessive Fines Clause but not the Double Jeopardy
Clause. It is difficult to imagine why the Framers of the two Amendments would have required a particular sanction not to be excessive, but
would have allowed it to be imposed multiple times for the same offense.

cluded that it was motivated by a "penal and prohibitoryintent." Id., at 781 (internal quotation marks omitted).

On that basis, we held that imposition of the tax after crimi-nal prosecution of the taxpayer violated double jeopardy.

The approach taken was thus identical to that followed in
Austin. By considering and rejecting each of the asserted"remedial" interests served by the sanction, we reasoned

that the tax had an "unmistakable punitive character" thatrendered it punishment in all of its applications. 511 U. S.,
at 783.The claim that Halper's "case-by-case" method is "impossible to apply" to forfeitures or taxes, ante, at 284, 285, thusmisses the point. It is true that since fixed penalties can
serve only one remedial end (compensation), it is easy todetermine whether a particular fine is punitive in application. Forfeitures and taxes, generally speaking, may havea number of remedial rationales. But to decide if a sanction is punitive, one need only examine each claimed reme-dial interest and determine whether the sanction actually
promotes it. Many of our cases have followed just such anapproach, regardless of whether any nonpunitive purpose
can be "quantif[ied]," ante, at 284. See, e. g., Austin; One1958 Plymouth Sedan. The majority itself embarks on such
an inquiry in Part II-C of its opinion. Furthermore, evenin the context of forfeitures and taxes, nothing prevents a
court from deciding that although a sanction is designed tobe remedial, its application in a particular case is so extreme
as to constitute punishment. Austin, 509 U. S., at 608, n. 4.7

6 Specifically, the tax was conditioned on the commission of a crime, 511
U. S., at 781, and it was levied on goods that the taxpayer did not own or
possess at the time of imposition, id., at 783.

7 It is true, as the Court asserts, that a fine will only be considered

"excessive" if it is disproportionate to any remedial goal. But Austin
established that a forfeiture can also be excessive, although it could serve
multiple remedial goals. Hence, I do not understand why the Court maintains that Austin did not prove that forfeitures are punitive. In order to
count as a "fine" in the first place, a forfeiture must be capable of being
punitive. A penalty that is not a "fine" cannot violate the Excessive Fines

Opinion of Stevens, J.
In reaching the conclusion that the civil forfeiture at issueyielded punishment, the Austin Court surveyed the history

of civil forfeitures at some length. That history is repletewith expressions of the idea that forfeitures constitute
punishment.8 But it was not necessary in Austin, strictlyspeaking, to decide that all in rem forfeitures are punitive.
As Justice Scalia emphasized in his separate opinion, itwas only necessary to characterize the specific "

in rem for-feiture in this case." Id., at 626 (opinion concurring in part

and concurring in judgment). The punitive nature of$$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) was accepted by every Member of the
Austin Court. The majority offered several reasons for itsholding. The applicable provisions expressly provided an
"innocent owner" defense, indicating that culpability was arequirement for forfeiture. Further, the provisions tied forfeiture directly to the commission of narcotics offenses. Id.,at 620. Finally, the legislative history indicated that the
provisions were necessary because traditional criminal sanc-tions were " `inadequate to deter or punish.' "

Ibid. (quotingS. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 191 (1983)). In sum, it was unanimously agreed that "[s]tatutory forfeitures under $ 881(a) arecertainly

payment (in kind), to a sovereign as punishmentfor an offense." 509 U. S., at 626-627 (

Scalia, J., concurringin part and concurring in judgment) (emphasis in original).

9

Remarkably, the Court today stands Austin on its head--a decision rendered only three years ago, with unanimity on

Clause, no matter how "excessive." See Browning-Ferris Industries of
Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257 (1989).

8 See, e. g., Peisch v. Ware, 4 Cranch 347, 364 (1808) (Marshall, C. J.)

("[T]he act punishes the owner with a forfeiture of the goods"); J. W. Goldsmith, Jr.-Grant Co. v. United States, 254 U. S. 505, 510-511 (1921) (the
owner of an automobile confiscated for its use in transporting liquor during Prohibition is " `properly punished by such forfeiture' ") (quoting 1 W.
Blackstone, Commentaries *301).

9 Just this Term, we have reiterated this conclusion. See Libretti v.

United States, 516 U. S. 29, 39 (1995) ("[T]he in rem civil forfeiture authorized by 21 U. S. C. $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) is punitive in nature").

Opinion of Stevens, J.
the pertinent points--and concludes that $ 881(a)(7) is remedial rather than punitive in character. Every reason Austin
gave for treating $ 881(a)(7) as punitive--the Court rejects
or ignores. Every reason the Court provides for treating

$ 881(a)(7) as remedial--Austin rebuffed. The Court claims
that its conclusion is consistent with decisions reviewing
statutes "indistinguishable" "in most significant respects"
from $ 881(a)(7), ante, at 290, but ignores the fact that Austin
reached the opposite conclusion as to the identical statute
under review here.

First, the Court supposes that forfeiture of respondent's
house is remedial in nature because it was an instrumentality of a drug crime. It is perfectly conceivable that certain
kinds of instruments used in the commission of crimes could
be forfeited for remedial purposes. Items whose principal
use is illegal--for example, the distillery in Various Items--
might be thus forfeitable. But it is difficult to understand
how a house in which marijuana was found helped to substantially "facilitate" a narcotics offense, or how forfeiture
of that house will meaningfully thwart the drug trade. In
Austin, we rejected the argument that a mobile home and
body shop were "instruments" of drug trafficking simply because marijuana was sold out of them. I see no basis for a
distinction here.10

Second, the Court claims that the statute serves the purpose of deterrence, which helps to show that it is remedial
rather than punitive in character. Ante, at 292. That statement cannot be squared with our precedents. Halper ex10 The Court also speculates that nuisance abatement may provide a remedial interest. Ante, at 290-291. The abatement theory was questionable enough in Bennis v. Michigan, 516 U. S. 442 (1996), where under the
State's theory the same acts might or might not turn an ordinary automobile into a nuisance, depending on the neighborhood in which the car happened to be parked. See id., at 464, n. 9 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Here,
there is no argument that Ursery's home constituted some kind of a
nuisance.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
pressly held, and Austin and Kurth Ranch reaffirmed, that
"a civil sanction that cannot fairly be said solely to serve a
remedial purpose, but rather can only be explained as also
serving either retributive or deterrent purposes, is punishment" for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. 490
U. S., at 448. " `Retribution and deterrence are not legitimate nonpunitive governmental objectives.' " Ibid. (emphasis added) (quoting Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 539,
n. 20 (1979)). To say otherwise is to renounce Halper's central holding. If deterrence is a legitimate remedial rationale "distinct from" any punitive purpose, ante, at 292, then
the $130,000 fine in Halper could not be condemned as excessive because it plainly served a powerful deterrent function. It was a premise of the Court's analysis in that case
that deterrence could not justify a penal sanction. As in
Bennis v. Michigan, where the Court first announced this

new view of deterrence, it simply ignores Halper without
explanation or comment. See 516 U. S., at 468-469 (Stevens, J., dissenting).

For good measure, the Court also rejects two considerations that persuaded the majority in Austin to find 21
U. S. C. $ 881(a)(7) a punitive statute. The Court first asserts that the statute contains no scienter requirement and
property may be forfeited summarily if no one files claim
to it. Ante, at 291-292 (citing 19 U. S. C. $ 1609). Property
that is not claimed, however, is considered abandoned; it
proves nothing that the Government is able to forfeit property that no one owns. Any time the Government seeks
to forfeit claimed property, it must prove that the claimant
is culpable, for the statute contains an express "innocent
owner" exception. Today the Court finds the structure of
the statute irrelevant, but Austin said that the exemption
for innocent owners "makes [the statute] look more like punishment." 509 U. S., at 619. In United States v. United
States Coin & Currency, 401 U. S. 715 (1971), the Court

Opinion of Stevens, J.
found a forfeiture statute punitive on the basis of discre-tionary authority granted to the Secretary of the Treasury

to remit property to innocent owners that was provided bya different statute.

Finally, the Court announces that the fact that the statuteis "tied to criminal activity" is insufficient to render it punitive. Ante, at 292. Austin expressly relied on Congress'decision to "tie forfeiture directly to the commission of drug
offenses" as evidence that it was intended to be punitive.509 U. S., at 620.

11

The recurrent theme of the Court's opinion is that there issome mystical difference between

in rem and in personamproceedings, such that only the latter can give rise to double

jeopardy concerns. The Court claims that "[s]ince at leastVarious Items," we have drawn this distinction for purposes
of applying relevant constitutional provisions. Ante, at 283.That statement, however, is incorrect. We have repeatedly
rejected the idea that the nature of the court's jurisdictionhas any bearing on the constitutional protections that apply
at a proceeding before it. "From the relevant constitutionalstandpoint, there is no difference between a man who `forfeits' $8,674 because he has used the money in illegal gam-bling activities and a man who pays a `criminal fine' of $8,674
as a result of the same course of conduct." Coin & Cur-rency, 401 U. S., at 718. See also One 1958 Plymouth Sedan,
380 U. S., at 701, n. 11; Boyd, 116 U. S., at 638.12 Most re11 Apparently recognizing the difficulty of reconciling its analysis of

$ 881(a)(7) with Austin's, the Court admits that the statute "perhaps ha[s]
certain punitive aspects," but finds them outweighed by its "important
nonpunitive goals." Ante, at 290. Again, that approach simply repudiates Halper, which defined as punishment for purposes of the Double
Jeopardy Clause any sanction that "cannot fairly be said solely to serve a
remedial purpose." 490 U. S., at 448 (emphasis added).

12 "[A]lthough the owner of goods, sought to be forfeited by a proceeding

to the suit; he certainly is so, after making claim and defence; and, in a

cently, in our application of Halper's definition of punish-ment, we stated that "[w]e do not understand the Government to rely separately on the technical distinction betweenproceedings

in rem and proceedings in personam, but we
note that any such reliance would be misplaced." Austin,
509 U. S., at 615, n. 9.13The notion that the label attached to the proceeding is dispositive runs contrary to the trend of our recent cases. In
Halper we stated that "the labels `criminal' and `civil' are
not of paramount importance" in determining whether a pro-ceeding punishes an individual. 490 U. S., at 447. In

Kurth
Ranch we held that the Double Jeopardy Clause applies topunitive proceedings even if they are labeled a tax. Indeed,

in reaching that conclusion, we followed a 1931 decision thatnoted that a tax statute might be considered punitive for
double jeopardy purposes.14 It is thus far too late in theday to contend that the label placed on a punitive proceeding
determines whether it is covered by the Double Jeopardy
Clause.

case like the present, he is entitled to all the privileges which appertain
to a person who is prosecuted for a forfeiture of his property by reason of
committing a criminal offence." Boyd, 116 U. S., at 638.

13 The Court suggests that the decision in One Lot Emerald Cut Stones

v. United States, 409 U. S. 232 (1972), rested on the fact that the second
penalty was "in personam," ante, at 276, but the opinion of the Court did
not even mention that term. In United States v. One Assortment of 89
Firearms, 465 U. S. 354 (1984), the Court discussed the fact that the forfeiture was in rem, but only for the rather obvious point that Congress
intended the proceeding to be "civil."

14 "That case, United States v. La Franca, 282 U. S. 568 (1931), observed

that the words `tax' and `penalty' `are not interchangeable, one for the
other' and that `if an exaction be clearly a penalty it cannot be converted
into a tax by the simple expedient of calling it such.' Id., at 572. See
also Lipke v. Lederer, 259 U. S. 557, 561 (1922) (`The mere use of the word

enough to show that within the true intendment of the term a tax was

Opinion of Stevens, J.
The pedantic distinction between in rem and in personamactions is ultimately only a cover for the real basis for the

Court's decision: the idea that the property, not the owner,is being "punished" for offenses of which it is "guilty." Although the Court prefers not to rely on this notorious fictiontoo blatantly, its repeated citations to

Various Items makeclear that the Court believes respondent's home was "guilty"

of the drug offenses with which he was charged. See ante,at 283. On that rationale, of course, the case is easy. The
owner of the property is not being punished when theGovernment confiscates it, just the property. The same
sleight-of-hand would have worked in Austin, too: The ownerof the property is not being excessively fined, just the property itself. Despite the Government's heavy reliance onthat fiction in

Austin, we did not allow it to stand in theway of our holding that the seizure of property may punish

the owner.15Even if the point had not been settled by prior decisions,
common sense would dictate the result in this case. Thereis simply no rational basis for characterizing the seizure of
this respondent's home as anything other than punishmentfor his crime. The house was neither proceeds nor contraband and its value had no relation to the Government's au-thority to seize it. Under the controlling statute an essential predicate for the forfeiture was proof that respondent

15 Long ago the Court cast doubt on this fiction:
"But where the owner of the property has been admitted as a claimant,
we cannot see the force of this distinction; nor can we assent to the proposition that the proceeding is not, in effect, a proceeding against the owner
of the property, as well as against the goods; for it is his breach of the
laws which has to be proved to establish the forfeiture, and it is his property which is sought to be forfeited . . . . In the words of a great judge,
`Goods, as goods, cannot offend, forfeit, unlade, pay duties, or the like, but
men whose goods they are.'*

had used the property in connection with the commission ofa crime. The forfeiture of this property was unquestionably

"a penalty that had absolutely no correlation to any damagessustained by society or to the cost of enforcing the law."
United States v. Ward, 448 U. S., at 254. As we unanimouslyrecognized in

Halper, formalistic distinctions that obscurethe obvious practical consequences of governmental action

disserve the " `humane interests' " protected by the DoubleJeopardy Clause. 490 U. S., at 447, quoting United States
ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537, 554 (1943) (Frankfurter,J., concurring). Fidelity to both reason and precedent dictates the conclusion that this forfeiture was "punishment"for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

16

II
The Government also argues that the word "jeopardy"refers only to a criminal proceeding, and that our cases precluding two punishments for the same offense apply only tosituations in which the first punishment was imposed after
conviction of a crime. In this case the civil forfeiture pro-ceeding antedated the filing of the criminal charge. Since
the civil case was not a "jeopardy," the argument runs, thecriminal case was the first, rather than the second, jeopardy.
This argument is foreclosed by our decisions in Halper and
Kurth Ranch.Although the point was not expressly mentioned in either

case, both holdings necessarily rested on the assumption thatthe civil proceeding in which the second punishment was
imposed was a "jeopardy" within the meaning of the Fifth

16 As I have emphasized, the determination that 21 U. S. C. $ 881(a)(7) is
a punitive statute is perfectly consistent with a conclusion that other types
of sanctions are remedial. For example, I would expect that many types
of administrative licensing sanctions are remedial in the relevant sense of
our cases. See Comment, Administrative Driver's License Suspension: A
Remedial Tool That is Not in Jeopardy, 45 Am. U. L. Rev. 1151 (1996)
(arguing that suspension of a driver's license after conviction for drunken
driving is a remedial sanction under the logic of Halper, Austin, and
Kurth Ranch).

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Amendment. Otherwise there would have been no basis forconcluding that the defendants had been "twice put in jeopardy" as the text of the Clause forbids. The prohibitionagainst two such proceedings cannot depend on the order
in which they are filed. Cf. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S., at 804(

Scalia, J., dissenting) ("[I]f there is a constitutional prohibi-tion on multiple punishments, the order of punishment cannot possibly make any difference").

III
The Government's third argument is that the civil forfeit-ure and the criminal proceeding did not involve the same

offense. The Government relies principally on Blockburgerv.

United States, 284 U. S. 299 (1932), in which we held thatfor double jeopardy purposes two statutes define different

offenses if "each provision requires proof of a fact which theother does not."

Id., at 304. The application of that testwould avoid any double jeopardy objection to a forfeiture

followed by a prosecution--or a prosecution followed by aforfeiture--whenever the seizure could be supported without
proof that the defendant committed a crime and the convic-tion did not require proof that the forfeited property had
been used illegally.Thus, if instead of forfeiting Ursery's home the Government had decided to forfeit his neighbor's property wherethe marijuana was grown, the

Blockburger rule would avoidany double jeopardy objection to either the forfeiture or

respondent's prosecution. In that scenario, the forfeiturecould be supported without proof that Ursery violated the
law and Ursery could be convicted without proof that he har-vested the marijuana on property owned by someone else.

The rule does, however, bar this conviction because theelements that the Government was required to allege and
prove to sustain the forfeiture of Ursery's home under$ 881(a)(7) included each of the elements of the offense for
which he was later convicted. As in Illinois v. Vitale, 447U. S. 410 (1980), and

Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682

518us2$79I 05-20-99 06:35:20 PAGES OPINPGT
318 UNITED STATES v. URSERY

Opinion of Stevens, J.
(1977) (per curiam), the fact that the "greater" offense (here,the forfeiture) could have been proved by means of a different "lesser" offense does not negate the fact that in this in-stance it

was proved by resort to the same elements as the
criminal offense. This conclusion also accords with our oftrepeated understanding of the relationship between a civilforfeiture and the underlying offense. See,

e. g., One 1958
Plymouth Sedan, 380 U. S., at 701 ("[T]he forfeiture isclearly a penalty for the criminal offense");

Boyd, 116 U. S.,
at 634 (describing sanction as "proceedings instituted for thepurpose of declaring the forfeiture of a man's property by

reason of offences committed by him"). Accordingly, under
the analysis we unanimously applied most recently in Rutledge v. United States, 517 U. S. 292 (1996), the criminal
charge was a lesser included offense of the forfeiture and
therefore constituted a second jeopardy.

Justice Kennedy joins the Court's opinion and therefore
ought to agree with the majority that civil forfeitures do not
constitute punishment for purposes of the Double Jeopardy
Clause. In fact, however, he recognizes that "[f]orfeiture
. . . punishes an owner by taking property involved in a
crime." Ante, at 295. His real objection is that a forfeiture
does not punish for the same offense as the underlying criminal conviction.

Justice Kennedy theorizes that civil forfeiture punishes
for the misuse of property. Ante, at 294. It might be true
that some forfeiture statutes are best described as creating
a sanction for misuse, as opposed to (but perhaps in addition
to) a sanction for the substantive criminal offense. But,
again, this statute is not structured that way. Section
881(a)(7) incorporates the criminal offense itself as the predicate for the forfeiture. See 21 U. S. C. $ 881(a)(7) (subjecting
to forfeiture "[a]ll real property . . . which is used . . . to
commit . . . a violation of this subchapter punishable by more
than one year's imprisonment"). Furthermore, the innocent
owner exemption in the same subsection provides that "no

property shall be forfeited under this paragraph . . . by rea-son of any act or omission established by that owner to have

been committed or omitted without the knowledge or con-sent of that owner." Ibid. (emphasis added). In Austin, we
held that the exemption revealed a "congressional intent topunish only those involved in drug trafficking" because " `the
traditional criminal sanctions . . . are inadequate to deter orpunish the enormously profitable trade in dangerous drugs.' "
509 U. S., at 619, 620 (quoting S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 191).See also 509 U. S., at 628 (

Scalia, J., concurring in part andconcurring in judgment) (suggesting that proportionality of

a forfeiture be measured by the relationship of the propertyto the underlying offense). Again, these statements accord
with common sense: Forfeiting respondent's house punishedhim for the same narcotics violations as his criminal
conviction. IV

The final argument advanced by the Government is thatthe forfeiture and the criminal conviction should be treated
as having occurred in the same proceeding because bothwere commenced before a final judgment was entered in
either. Emphasizing the fact that the Double JeopardyClause, and particularly the prohibition against multiple punishments for the same offense, protects the defendant's legit-imate expectation of finality in the original sentence, the
Government maintains that such an expectation could notarise until after one proceeding was completed. Moreover,
it argues, the civil and criminal sanctions "cannot be (andnever have been) joined together in a single trial under our
system of justice." Brief for United States 55.This argument is unpersuasive because it is simply inaccurate to describe two separate proceedings as one.17 I alsocannot agree with the Government's view that there is any

17 In Kurth Ranch we explicitly noted that the tax assessment and the
prosecution were "separate legal proceedings." 511 U. S., at 772.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
procedural obstacle to including a punitive forfeiture in thefinal judgment entered in a criminal case. The sentencing

proceeding does not commence until after the defendant hasbeen found guilty, and I do not see why that proceeding
should not encompass all of the punitive sanctions that arewarranted by the conviction. Indeed, a draft of a proposed
amendment to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure en-visions precisely that procedure. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.
32(d)(2) (eff. Dec. 1, 1996).18 If, as we have already deter-mined, the "civil" forfeitures pursuant to $ 881(a)(7) are in
fact punitive, a single judgment encompassing the entirepunishment for the defendant's offense is precisely what the
Double Jeopardy Clause requires. Congress' decision tocreate novel and additional penalties should not be permitted
to eviscerate the protection against governmental overreach-ing embodied in the Double Jeopardy Clause. That protection has far deeper roots than the relatively recent enact-ments that have so dramatically expanded the sovereign's
power to forfeit private property.

* * *
One final example may illustrate the depth of my concernthat the Court's treatment of our cases has cut deeply into a

guarantee deemed fundamental by the Founders. TheCourt relies heavily on a few early decisions that involved
the forfeiture of vessels whose entire mission was unlawfuland on the Prohibition-era precedent sustaining the forfeiture of a distillery--a property that served no purpose otherthan the manufacture of illegal spirits. Notably none of
those early cases involved the forfeiture of a home as a form

18 According to the Rule, once there is a finding that property is subject
to a criminal forfeiture, the court may enter a preliminary forfeiture order.
The order also authorizes the Attorney General to seize the property, conduct any necessary discovery, and begin proceedings to protect the rights
of third parties. The order of forfeiture becomes a part of the sentence
and is included in the judgment.

of punishment for misconduct that occurred therein. Con-sider how drastic the remedy would have been if Congress

in 1931 had authorized the forfeiture of every home in whichalcoholic beverages were consumed. Under the Court's reasoning, I fear that the label "civil," or perhaps "in rem,"would have been sufficient to avoid characterizing such forfeitures as "punitive" for purposes of the Double JeopardyClause. Our recent decisions in

Halper, Austin, and KurthRanch dictate a far different conclusion. I remain persuaded that those cases were correctly decided and shouldbe followed today.

Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the judgment inNo. 95-345.

Syllabus

LEWIS v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 95-6465. Argued April 23, 1996--Decided June 24, 1996
Petitioner was charged with two counts of obstructing the mail, each

charge carrying a maximum authorized prison sentence of six months.
He requested a jury, but the Magistrate Judge ordered a bench trial,
explaining that because she would not sentence him to more than six
months' imprisonment, he was not entitled to a jury trial. The District
Court affirmed. In affirming, the Court of Appeals noted that the Sixth
Amendment jury trial right pertains only to those offenses for which
the legislature has authorized a maximum penalty of over six months'
imprisonment, and that because each offense charged here was petty
in character, the fact that petitioner was facing more than six months'
imprisonment in the aggregate did not entitle him to a jury trial. The
court explained in dictum that because the offense's characterization as
petty or serious determined the right to a jury trial, not the sentence
faced, a trial judge's self-imposed limitation on sentencing could not deprive a defendant of that right.

Held:

1. A defendant who is prosecuted in a single proceeding for multiple
petty offenses does not have a Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial
where the aggregate prison term authorized for the offenses exceeds
six months. The right to a jury trial is reserved for defendants accused
of serious offenses and does not extend to petty offenses. Duncan v.
Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 159. The most relevant criterion with which
to assess the seriousness of an offense is the legislature's judgment of
the offense's character, primarily as expressed in the maximum authorized prison term. An offense carrying a maximum term of six months
or less is presumed petty, unless the legislature has authorized additional statutory penalties so severe as to indicate that it considered the
offense serious. E. g., Blanton v. North Las Vegas, 489 U. S. 538, 543.
Here, by setting the maximum prison term at six months, Congress
categorized the offense of obstructing the mail as petty. The fact that
petitioner was charged with two counts of a petty offense, and therefore
faced an aggregate potential prison term greater than six months, does
not change Congress' judgment of the particular offense's gravity, nor
does it transform the petty offense into a serious one, to which the

324 LEWIS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Amendment's guarantee of the right to a jury trial does notextend to petty offenses, and its scope does not change where

a defendant faces a potential aggregate prison term in excessof six months for petty offenses charged. Because we decide that no jury trial right exists where a defendant ischarged with multiple petty offenses, we do not reach the
second question. I

Petitioner Ray Lewis was a mail handler for the UnitedStates Postal Service. One day, postal inspectors saw him
open several pieces of mail and pocket the contents. Thenext day, the inspectors routed "test" mail, containing
marked currency, through petitioner's station. After seeingpetitioner open the mail and remove the currency, the inspectors arrested him. Petitioner was charged with two countsof obstructing the mail, in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 1701.
Each count carried a maximum authorized prison sentence ofsix months. Petitioner requested a jury, but the Magistrate
Judge granted the Government's motion for a bench trial.She explained that because she would not, under any circumstances, sentence petitioner to more than six months' impris-onment, he was not entitled to a jury trial.

Petitioner sought review of the denial of a jury trial, andthe District Court affirmed. Petitioner appealed, and the
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. 65 F. 3d252 (1995). The court noted that the Sixth Amendment jury
trial right pertains only to serious offenses, that is, those forwhich the legislature has authorized a maximum penalty of
over six months' imprisonment. The court then addressedthe question whether a defendant facing more than six
months' imprisonment in the aggregate for multiple pettyoffenses is nevertheless entitled to a jury trial. The Court
of Appeals concluded that, for determination of the rightto a jury trial, the proper focus is on the legislature's determination regarding the character of the offense, as indi-cated by maximum penalty authorized, not on the length of

Opinion of the Court
the maximum aggregate sentence faced. Id., at 254-255.Because each offense charged here was petty in character,

the court concluded that petitioner was not entitled to ajury trial.

The court explained in dictum that because the characterof the offense as petty or serious determined the right to a
jury trial, not the sentence faced, a trial judge's self-imposedlimitation on sentencing could not deprive a defendant of the
right to a jury trial. Id., at 255-256.We granted certiorari, 516 U. S. 1088 (1996), to resolve a
conflict in the Courts of Appeals over whether a defendantprosecuted in a single proceeding for multiple petty offenses
has a constitutional right to a jury trial, where the aggregatesentence authorized for the offenses exceeds six months' imprisonment, and whether such jury trial right can be elimi-nated by a judge's pretrial commitment that the aggregate
sentence imposed will not exceed six months. See UnitedStates v. Coppins, 953 F. 2d 86 (CA4 1991); United States v.
Bencheck, 926 F. 2d 1512 (CA10 1991); Rife v. Godbehere, 814F. 2d 563 (CA9 1987).

II
The Sixth Amendment guarantees that "[i]n all criminalprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy

and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and districtwherein the crime shall have been committed . . . ." It is
well established that the Sixth Amendment, like the commonlaw, reserves this jury trial right for prosecutions of serious
offenses, and that "there is a category of petty crimes oroffenses which is not subject to the Sixth Amendment jury
trial provision." Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 159(1968).

To determine whether an offense is properly characterizedas "petty," courts at one time looked to the nature of the
offense and whether it was triable by a jury at common law.Such determinations became difficult, because many statutory offenses lack common-law antecedents. Blanton v.

326 LEWIS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
North Las Vegas, 489 U. S. 538, 541, and n. 5 (1989). There-fore, more recently, we have instead sought "objective indications of the seriousness with which society regards the of-fense."

Frank v. United States, 395 U. S. 147, 148 (1969);
accord, District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U. S. 617, 628
(1937). Now, to determine whether an offense is petty, weconsider the maximum penalty attached to the offense. This

criterion is considered the most relevant with which to as-sess the character of an offense, because it reveals the legislature's judgment about the offense's severity. "The judi-ciary should not substitute its judgment as to seriousness for
that of a legislature, which is far better equipped to perform
the task . . . ." Blanton, 489 U. S., at 541 (internal quotation
marks omitted). In evaluating the seriousness of the offense, we place primary emphasis on the maximum prison
term authorized. While penalties such as probation or a fine
may infringe on a defendant's freedom, the deprivation of
liberty imposed by imprisonment makes that penalty the
best indicator of whether the legislature considered an
offense to be "petty" or "serious." Id., at 542. An offense
carrying a maximum prison term of six months or less is
presumed petty, unless the legislature has authorized additional statutory penalties so severe as to indicate that the
legislature considered the offense serious. Id., at 543;
Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, 418 U. S. 506, 512 (1974).

Here, the maximum authorized penalty for obstruction of
mail is six months' imprisonment--a penalty that presumptively places the offense in the "petty" category. We face
the question whether petitioner is nevertheless entitled to a
jury trial, because he was tried in a single proceeding for two
counts of the petty offense so that the potential aggregated
penalty is 12 months' imprisonment.

Petitioner argues that, where a defendant is charged with
multiple petty offenses in a single prosecution, the Sixth
Amendment requires that the aggregate potential penalty be
the basis for determining whether a jury trial is required.

327Cite as: 518 U. S. 322 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
Although each offense charged here was petty, petitionerfaced a potential penalty of more than six months' imprisonment; and, of course, if any offense charged had authorizedmore than six months' imprisonment, he would have been
entitled to a jury trial. The Court must look to the aggregate potential prison term to determine the existence of thejury trial right, petitioner contends, not to the "petty" character of the offenses charged.We disagree. The Sixth Amendment reserves the jury
trial right to defendants accused of serious crimes. As setforth above, we determine whether an offense is serious by
looking to the judgment of the legislature, primarily as expressed in the maximum authorized term of imprisonment.
Here, by setting the maximum authorized prison term at six
months, the Legislature categorized the offense of obstructing the mail as petty. The fact that petitioner was charged
with two counts of a petty offense does not revise the legislative judgment as to the gravity of that particular offense,
nor does it transform the petty offense into a serious one, to
which the jury trial right would apply. We note that there
is precedent at common law that a jury trial was not provided to a defendant charged with multiple petty offenses.
See, e. g., Queen v. Matthews, 10 Mod. 26, 88 Eng. Rep. 609
(Q. B. 1712); King v. Swallow, 8 T. R. 285, 101 Eng. Rep. 1392
(K. B. 1799).

Petitioner nevertheless insists that a defendant is entitled
to a jury trial whenever he faces a deprivation of liberty for
a period exceeding six months, a proposition for which he
cites our precedent establishing the six-months' prison sentence as the presumptive cutoff for determining whether an
offense is "petty" or "serious." To be sure, in the cases in
which we sought to determine the line between "petty" and
"serious" for Sixth Amendment purposes, we considered the
severity of the authorized deprivation of liberty as an indicator of the legislature's appraisal of the offense. See Blanton, supra, at 542-543; Baldwin v. New York, 399 U. S. 66,

328 LEWIS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
68-69 (1970) (plurality opinion). But it is now settled thata legislature's determination that an offense carries a maximum prison term of six months or less indicates its viewthat an offense is "petty."

Blanton, supra, at 543. Where
we have a judgment by the legislature that an offense is
"petty," we do not look to the potential prison term faced bya

particular defendant who is charged with more than one
such petty offense. The maximum authorized penalty pro-vides an "objective indicatio[n] of the seriousness with which

society regards the offense," Frank, 395 U. S., at 148, and itis that indication that is used to determine whether a jury
trial is required, not the particularities of an individual case.
Here, the penalty authorized by Congress manifests its judgment that the offense is petty, and the term of imprisonment
faced by petitioner by virtue of the second count does not
alter that fact.

Petitioner directs our attention to Codispoti for support
for the assertion that the "aggregation of multiple petty offenses renders a prosecution serious for jury trial purposes."
Brief for Petitioner 18. Codispoti is inapposite. There, defendants were each convicted at a single, nonjury trial for
several charges of criminal contempt. The Court was unable to determine the legislature's judgment of the character
of that offense, however, because the legislature had not set
a specific penalty for criminal contempt. In such a situation,
where the legislature has not specified a maximum penalty,
courts use the severity of the penalty actually imposed as the
measure of the character of the particular offense. Codispoti, supra, at 511; Frank, supra, at 149. Here, in contrast,
we need not look to the punishment actually imposed, because we are able to discern Congress' judgment of the character of the offense.

Furthermore, Codispoti emphasized the special concerns
raised by the criminal contempt context. Contempt "often
strikes at the most vulnerable and human qualities of a
judge's temperament. Even where the contempt is not a di518us2$80J 05-18-99 17:00:11 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
rect insult to the court . . . it frequently represents a rejec-tion of judicial authority, or an interference with the judicial

process . . . ." Codispoti, 418 U. S., at 516 (internal quota-tion marks omitted); see also

Mayberry v. Pennsylvania, 400
U. S. 455, 465-466 (1971). In the face of courtroom disruption, a judge may have difficulty maintaining the detachmentnecessary for fair adjudication; at the same time, it is a judge

who "determines which and how many acts of contempt thecitation will cover," "determine[s] guilt or innocence absent
a jury," and "impose[s] the sentence." Codispoti, 418 U. S.,at 515. Therefore,

Codispoti concluded that the concentration of power in the judge in the often heated contempt context presented the "very likelihood of arbitrary action that
the requirement of jury trial was intended to avoid or alleviate." Ibid. The benefit of a jury trial, " `as a protection
against the arbitrary exercise of official power,' " was
deemed particularly important in that context. Id., at 516
(quoting Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 194, 202 (1968)).

The absence of a legislative judgment about the offense's
seriousness, coupled with the unique concerns presented in
a criminal contempt case, persuaded us in Codispoti that,
in those circumstances, the jury trial right should be determined by the aggregate penalties actually imposed. Codispoti was held to be entitled to a jury trial, because the
sentence actually imposed on him for criminal contempt exceeded six months. By comparison, in Taylor v. Hayes, 418
U. S. 488 (1974), which similarly involved a defendant convicted of criminal contempt in a jurisdiction where the legislature had not specified a penalty, we determined that the
defendant was not entitled to a jury trial, because the sentence actually imposed for criminal contempt did not exceed
six months. Contrary to Justice Kennedy's argument,
see post, at 331-334, 338, Codispoti and Taylor do not stand
for the sweeping proposition that, outside their narrow context, the jury trial right is determined by the aggregate penalties faced by a defendant.

330 LEWIS v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
Certainly the aggregate potential penalty faced by peti-tioner is of serious importance to him. But to determine

whether an offense is serious for Sixth Amendment pur-poses, we look to the legislature's judgment, as evidenced
by the maximum penalty authorized. Where the offensescharged are petty, and the deprivation of liberty exceeds six
months only as a result of the aggregation of charges, thejury trial right does not apply. As petitioner acknowledges,
even if he were to prevail, the Government could properlycircumvent the jury trial right by charging the counts in
separate informations and trying them separately.The Constitution's guarantee of the right to a jury trial
extends only to serious offenses, and petitioner was notcharged with a serious offense. That he was tried for two
counts of a petty offense, and therefore faced an aggregatepotential term of imprisonment of more than six months,
does not change the fact that the Legislature deemed thisoffense petty. Petitioner is not entitled to a jury trial.

Because petitioner is not entitled to a jury trial, we neednot reach the question whether a judge's self-imposed limitation on sentencing may affect the jury trial right.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the SecondCircuit is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Breyer joins,concurring in the judgment.

This petitioner had no constitutional right to a jury trialbecause from the outset it was settled that he could be sentenced to no more than six months' imprisonment for his
combined petty offenses. The particular outcome, however,should not obscure the greater consequence of today's unfortunate decision. The Court holds that a criminal defendantmay be convicted of innumerable offenses in one proceeding
and sentenced to any number of years' imprisonment, allwithout benefit of a jury trial, so long as no one of the

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
offenses considered alone is punishable by more than sixmonths in prison. The holding both in its doctrinal formulation and in its practical effect is one of the most serious in-cursions on the right to jury trial in the Court's history, and
it cannot be squared with our precedents. The Sixth
Amendment guarantees a jury trial to a defendant chargedwith a serious crime.

Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145,
159 (1968). Serious crimes, for purposes of the SixthAmendment, are defined to include any offense which carries

a maximum penalty of more than six months in prison; theright to jury trial attaches to those crimes regardless of the
sentence in fact imposed. Id., at 159-160. This doctrine is
not questioned here, but it does not define the outer limits
of the right to trial by jury. Our cases establish a further
proposition: The right to jury trial extends as well to a
defendant who is sentenced in one proceeding to more than
six months' imprisonment. Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, 418
U. S. 506 (1974); Taylor v. Hayes, 418 U. S. 488 (1974). To
be more specific, a defendant is entitled to a jury if tried in
a single proceeding for more than one petty offense when
the combined sentences will exceed six months' imprisonment; taken together, the crimes then are considered serious
for constitutional purposes, even if each is petty by itself,
Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, supra, at 517.

The defendants in Codispoti and Taylor had been convicted of criminal contempt without juries in States where
the legislatures had not set a maximum penalty for the
crime. Taylor was convicted of nine separate contempts
and sentenced to six months in prison. The Court held he
was not entitled to a jury trial. Since the total sentence
was only six months' imprisonment, the "eight contempts,
whether considered singly or collectively, thus constituted
petty offenses, and trial by jury was not required." Taylor
v. Hayes, supra, at 496. Codispoti, by contrast, was convicted of seven contempts, and he was sentenced to six terms
of six months' imprisonment and one term of three months'

332 LEWIS v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
imprisonment, each to run consecutively--a total of 39months. We held he was entitled to a trial by jury because

his aggregate sentence exceeded six months. In Codispoti,Pennsylvania made the same argument the United States
makes today. It said no jury trial is required if the maximum punishment for each offense does not exceed six monthsin prison. We rejected the claim, saying:

"Here the contempts . . . were tried seriatim in one proceeding, and the trial judge not only imposed a separatesentence for each contempt but also determined that the

individual sentences were to run consecutively rather
than concurrently, a ruling which necessarily extendedthe prison term to be served beyond that allowable for

a petty criminal offense. As a result of this single pro-ceeding, Codispoti was sentenced to three years and
three months for his seven contemptuous acts . . . . Interms of the sentence imposed, which was obviously several times more than six months, [Codispoti] was tried
for what was equivalent to a serious offense and wasentitled to a jury trial.

"We find unavailing respondent's contrary argumentthat [Codispoti's] contempts were separate offenses and
that, because no more than a six months' sentence wasimposed for any single offense, each contempt was necessarily a petty offense triable without a jury. Not-withstanding respondent's characterization of the proceeding, the salient fact remains that the contempts
arose from a single trial, were charged by a single judge,and were tried in a single proceeding. The individual

sentences imposed were then aggregated, one sentence
taking account of the others and not beginning until the
immediately preceding sentence had expired." Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, supra, at 516-517.

The reasons the Court offers to distinguish these cases are
not convincing. The Court first suggests Codispoti's holding

333Cite as: 518 U. S. 322 (1996)
Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
turned on the absence of a statutory maximum sentence for
criminal contempt. Ante, at 328. The absence of a statutory maximum sentence, however, has nothing whatever to
do with whether a court must aggregate the penalties that
are in fact imposed for each crime. Indeed, we know the
open-ended penalty to which Codispoti was subject was not
the reason he was entitled a jury trial because Taylor, decided the same day, held that a defendant who was subject
to the same kind of open-ended sentencing was not entitled
to trial by jury because the sentence he received did not in
fact exceed six months. Taken together, Codispoti and Taylor stand for the proposition the Court now rejects: Sentences for petty offenses must be aggregated in determining
whether a defendant is entitled to a jury trial. Cf. State v.
McCarroll, 337 So. 2d 475, 480 (La. 1976) (concluding Codispoti compelled it to overrule Monroe v. Wilhite, 233 So. 2d
535 (La.), cert. denied, 400 U. S. 910 (1970), which had held
the Sixth Amendment did not require aggregation of penalties for petty offenses to determine whether a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial).

The Court next suggests Codispoti's holding was based on
"the special concerns raised by the criminal contempt context." Ante, at 328. The Codispoti Court was indeed cognizant of the need "to maintain order in the courtroom and
the integrity of the trial process," 418 U. S., at 513, and so
approved summary conviction and sentencing for criminal
contempt, "where the necessity of circumstances warrants,"
id., at 514. The Court made clear that under those circumstances, a judge may sentence a defendant to more than
six months' imprisonment for more than one contempt without empaneling a jury. Id., at 514-515. The Court went on
to hold, however, that when the judge postpones the contempt trial until after the immediate proceedings have concluded, the "ordinary rudiments of due process" apply. Id.,
at 515. The "ordinary" rule required aggregation of penal518us2$80L 05-18-99 17:00:11 PAGES OPINPGT
334 LEWIS v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
ties, and because Codispoti's aggregated penalties exceededsix months' imprisonment, entitled him to a jury trial.

In authorizing retroactive consideration of the punishmenta defendant receives, the holdings of

Codispoti and Taylor
must not be confused with the line of cases entitling a defendant to a jury trial if he is charged with a crime punish-able by more than six months' imprisonment, regardless of

the sentence he in fact receives. The two lines of cases areconsistent. Crimes punishable by sentences of more than
six months are deemed by the community's social and ethi-cal judgments to be serious. See

District of Columbia v.
Clawans, 300 U. S. 617, 628 (1937). Opprobrium attaches to
conviction of those crimes regardless of the length of the
actual sentence imposed, and the stigma itself is enough to
entitle the defendant to a jury. See J. Proffatt, Trial by Jury
149 (1877) ( jury trial cannot be denied to a defendant subject
to "punishment which would render him infamous [or] affix
to him the ignominy of a criminal"). This rationale does not
entitle a defendant to trial by jury if he is charged only with
petty offenses; even if they could result in a long sentence
when taken together, convictions for petty offenses do not
carry the same stigma as convictions for serious crimes.

The imposition of stigma, however, is not the only or even
the primary consequence a jury trial serves to constrain.
As Codispoti recognizes, and as ought to be evident, the
Sixth Amendment also serves the different and more practical purpose of preventing a court from effecting a most serious deprivation of liberty--ordering a defendant to prison
for a substantial period of time--without the government's
persuading a jury he belongs there. A deprivation of liberty
so significant may be exacted if a defendant faces punishment
for a series of crimes, each of which can be punished by no
more than six months' imprisonment. The stakes for a defendant may then amount in the aggregate to many years in
prison, in which case he must be entitled to interpose a jury
between himself and the government. If the trial court

rules at the outset that no more than six months' impris-onment will be imposed for the combined petty offenses,

however, the liberty the jury serves to protect will not beendangered, and there is no corresponding right to jury
trial.

Although Codispoti and Taylor are binding precedents,my conclusion rests also on a more fundamental point, one

the Court refuses to confront: The primary purpose of thejury in our legal system is to stand between the accused and
the powers of the State. Among the most ominous of thoseis the power to imprison. Blackstone expressed this principle when he described the right to trial by jury as a "strong
. . . barrier . . . between the liberties of the people and the
prerogative of the crown." 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries
*349-*350. See also W. Forsyth, History of Trial by Jury
426 (1852) ("[I]t would be difficult to conceive a better security than this right affords against any exercise of arbitrary
violence on the part of the crown or a government acting in
the name of the crown. No matter how ardent may be its
wish to destroy or crush an obnoxious opponent, there can
be no real danger from its menaces or acts so long as the
party attacked can take refuge in a jury fairly and indifferently chosen"). In more recent times we have said the right
to jury trial "reflect[s] a profound judgment about the way
in which law should be enforced and justice administered."
Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S., at 155. Providing a defendant with the right to be tried by a jury gives "him an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge."
Id., at 156. These considerations all are present when a
judge in a single case sends a defendant to prison for years,
whether the sentence is the result of one serious offense or
several petty offenses.

On the Court's view of the case, however, there is no limit
to the length of the sentence a judge can impose on a defendant without entitling him to a jury, so long as the prosecutor

518us2$80L 05-18-99 17:00:11 PAGES OPINPGT
336 LEWIS v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
carves up the charges into segments punishable by no morethan six months apiece. Prosecutors have broad discretion

in framing charges, see Ball v. United States, 470 U. S. 856,859 (1985), for criminal conduct often does not arrange itself
in neat categories. In many cases, a prosecutor can choose
to charge a defendant with multiple petty offenses ratherthan a single serious offense, and so prevent him under today's holding from obtaining a trial by jury while still obtain-ing the same punishment. Cf.

People v. Estevez, 163 Misc.
2d 839, 847, 622 N. Y. S. 2d 870, 876 (Crim. Ct. 1995) ("ThePeople cannot have it both ways. They cannot in good faith

seek consolidation of several B misdemeanors, which have
been reduced from Class A misdemeanors, and then after
conviction of more than two offenses seek consecutive sentences which would expose the defendant to over six months'
imprisonment while at the same time deny the defendant the
right to a jury trial").

The Court does not aid its position when it notes, with
seeming approval, the Government's troubling suggestion
that a committed prosecutor could evade the rule here proposed by bringing a series of prosecutions in separate proceedings, each for an offense punishable by no more than six
months in prison. Ante, at 330. Were a prosecutor to take
so serious a view of a defendant's conduct as to justify the
burden of separate prosecutions, I should think the case an
urgent example of when a jury is most needed if the offenses
are consolidated. And if a defendant is subject to repeated
bench trials because of a prosecutor's scheme to confine him
in jail for years without benefit of a jury trial, at least he
will be provided certain safeguards as a result. The prosecution's witnesses, and its theory of the case, will be tested
more than once; the defendant will have repeated opportunities to convince the judge, or more than one judge, on the
merits; and quite apart from questions of included offenses,
the government may be barred by collateral estoppel if a
fact is found in favor of the defendant and is dispositive

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
in later trials, see Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436 (1970).Finally, the prosecutor will have to justify, at least to the

voters, this peculiar exercise of discretion. In short, if aprosecutor seeks to achieve a result forbidden in one trial by
the expedient of pursuing many, the process itself will constrain the prosecutor and protect the defendant in importantways. The Court's holding, of course, makes it easier rather

than more difficult for a government to evade the constraintsof the Sixth Amendment when it seeks to lock up a defendant
for a long time.The significance of the Court's decision quite transcends
the peculations of Ray Lewis, the petitioner here, who twice
filched from the mails. The decision affects more than
repeat violators of traffic laws, persons accused of public
drunkenness, persons who persist in breaches of the peace,
and the wide range of eccentrics capable of disturbing the
quiet enjoyment of life by others. Just as alarming is the
threat the Court's holding poses to millions of persons in
agriculture, manufacturing, and trade who must comply with
minute administrative regulations, many of them carrying a
jail term of six months or less. Violations of these sorts of
rules often involve repeated, discrete acts which can result
in potential liability of years of imprisonment. See, e. g., 16
U. S. C. $ 707 (violation of migratory bird treaties, laws, and
regulations); 29 U. S. C. $ 216 (penalties under Fair Labor
Standards Act); 36 CFR $ 1.3 (1995) (violation of National
Park Service regulations); id., $ 261.1b (violation of Forest
Service prohibitions); id., $ 327.25 (violation of Army Corps
of Engineers water resource development project regulations); 43 CFR $ 8351.1-1(b) (1995) (violation of Bureau of
Land management regulations under National Trails System
Act of 1968). Still, under the Court's holding it makes no
difference whether a defendant is sentenced to a year in
prison or for that matter to 20 years: As long as no single
violation charged is punishable by more than six months, the
defendant has no right to a jury.

338 LEWIS v. UNITED STATES

Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment
The petitioner errs in the opposite direction. He arguesa defendant is entitled to a jury trial whenever the penalties

for the crimes charged combine to exceed six months' impris-onment, even if the trial judge rules that no more than six
months' imprisonment will be imposed. We rejected this
position in Taylor, however, and rightly so. A defendantcharged with multiple petty offenses does not face the societal disapprobation attaching to conviction of a seriouscrime, and, so long as the trial judge rules at the outset that
no more than six months' imprisonment will be imposed, thedefendant does not face a serious deprivation of liberty. A
judge who so rules is not withdrawing from a defendant a
constitutional right to which he is entitled, as petitioner
claims; the defendant is not entitled to the right to begin
with if there is no potential for more than six months' imprisonment. The judge's statement has no independent force
but only clarifies what would have been the law in its absence. Codispoti holds that a judge cannot impose a sentence exceeding six months' imprisonment for multiple petty
offenses without conducting a jury trial, regardless of
whether the judge announces that fact from bench.

Amici in support of petitioner say it is inappropriate for
judges to make these kinds of sentencing decisions before
trial. The Court approved just this practice, however, in
Scott v. Illinois, 440 U. S. 367 (1979), holding the Sixth
Amendment does not require a judge to appoint counsel for
a criminal defendant in a misdemeanor case if the judge will
not sentence the defendant to any jail time. So too, Federal
Rule of Criminal Procedure 58(a)(2) authorizes district
courts not to apply the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
in petty offense prosecutions for which no sentence of imprisonment will be imposed. The rules contemplate the determination being made before trial. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.
58(a)(3).

Petitioner's proposal would impose an enormous burden
on an already beleaguered criminal justice system by in518us2$80L 05-18-99 17:00:11 PAGES OPINPGT

creasing to a dramatic extent the number of required jurytrials. There are thousands of instances where minor offenses are tried before a judge, and we would err on theother side of sensible interpretation were we to hold that
combining petty offenses in a single proceeding mandates ajury trial even when all possibility for a sentence longer than
six months has been foreclosed.

* * *
When a defendant's liberty is put at great risk in a trial,he is entitled to have the trial conducted to a jury. This

principle lies at the heart of the Sixth Amendment. TheCourt does grave injury to the Amendment by allowing a
defendant to suffer a prison term of any length after a singletrial before a single judge and without the protection of a
jury. I join only the Court's judgment.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,dissenting.

The Sixth Amendment provides that the accused is enti-tled to trial by an impartial jury "[i]n all criminal prosecutions." As Justice Kennedy persuasively explains, the"primary purpose of the jury in our legal system is to stand
between the accused and the powers of the State." Ante,at 335. The majority, relying exclusively on cases in which
the defendant was tried for a single offense, extends a ruledesigned with those cases in mind to the wholly dissimilar
circumstance in which the prosecution concerns multiple of-fenses. I agree with

Justice Kennedy to the extent hewould hold that a prosecution which exposes the accused to

a sentence of imprisonment longer than six months, whetherfor a single offense or for a series of offenses, is sufficiently
serious to confer on the defendant the right to demand ajury. See ante, at 335-337.

Unlike Justice Kennedy, however, I believe that theright to a jury trial attaches when the prosecution begins.

340 LEWIS v. UNITED STATES

Stevens, J., dissenting
I do not quarrel with the established view that only defendants whose alleged misconduct is deemed serious by the legislature are entitled to be judged by a jury. But in my
opinion, the legislature's determination of the severity of
the charges against a defendant is properly measured by
the maximum sentence authorized for the prosecution as
a whole. The text of the Sixth Amendment supports
this interpretation by referring expressly to "criminal
prosecutions."

Nothing in our prior precedents conflicts with this view.
True, some of our past cases (the ones on which the majority
relies) have referred to an "offense" rather than a "prosecution." See, e. g., Blanton v. North Las Vegas, 489 U. S. 538,
541 (1989); Frank v. United States, 395 U. S. 147, 148 (1969).
But the words were effectively interchangeable in those
cases because the prosecutions at issue concerned only one
offense. The contempt cases, which do involve multiple offenses, demonstrate that aggregation--that is, deciding
whether the defendant has a right to a jury trial on the basis
of the prosecution rather than the individual offenses--is
appropriate.

The majority attempts to distinguish Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, 418 U. S. 506 (1974), by suggesting that the Court's
decision in that case turned on the absence of any statutory
measure of severity. Ante, at 328. That observation is
certainly correct to a point: The contempt cases are special
because the sentence actually imposed provides the only
available yardstick by which to judge compliance with the
command of the Sixth Amendment. But that unique aspect
of the cases does not speak to the aggregation question.
Having determined that the defendants in Codispoti were
sentenced to no more than six months for any individual contempt, it would follow from the rule the Court announces
today that a jury trial was unnecessary. Yet we reversed
and remanded, holding that "each contemnor was tried for

Stevens, J., dissenting
what was equivalent to a serious offense and was [therefore]
entitled to a jury trial." 418 U. S., at 517 (emphasis added).*

Justice Kennedy reads a second contempt case, Taylor
v. Hayes, 418 U. S. 488 (1974), as standing for the proposition
that a judge may defeat the jury trial right by promising
a short sentence. He is mistaken. The dispositive fact in
Taylor was not that the prison term imposed was only six
months but rather that the actual sentence, acting as a proxy
for the legislative judgment, demonstrated that "the State
itself has determined that the contempt is not so serious as
to warrant more than a six-month sentence." Id., at 496.
In this case, by contrast, we have an explicit statutory expression of the legislative judgment that this prosecution is
serious--the two offenses charged are punishable by a maximum prison sentence of 12 months.

All agree that a judge may not strip a defendant of the
right to a jury trial for a serious crime by promising a sentence of six months or less. This is so because "[o]pprobrium attaches to conviction of those crimes regardless of
the length of the actual sentence imposed," ante, at 334
(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). In my view, the
same rule must apply to prosecutions involving multiple offenses which are serious by virtue of their aggregate possible sentence. I see no basis for assuming that the dishonor
associated with multiple convictions for petty offenses is less
than the dishonor associated with conviction of a single serious crime. Because the right attaches at the moment of
prosecution, a judge may not deprive a defendant of a jury
trial by making a pretrial determination that the crimes
charged will not warrant a sentence exceeding six months.

*The majority's speculation that the Court's holding in Codispoti was
limited to criminal contempt cases, ante, at 328-329, is persuasively answered by Justice Kennedy. See ante, at 333-334 (opinion concurring
in judgment).

LEWIS, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF

CORRECTIONS, et al. v. CASEY et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 94-1511. Argued November 29, 1995--Decided June 24, 1996
Respondents, who are inmates of various prisons operated by the Arizona

Department of Corrections (ADOC), brought a class action against petitioners, ADOC officials, alleging that petitioners were furnishing them
with inadequate legal research facilities and thereby depriving them of
their right of access to the courts, in violation of Bounds v. Smith, 430
U. S. 817. The District Court found petitioners to be in violation of
Bounds and issued an injunction mandating detailed, systemwide
changes in ADOC's prison law libraries and in its legal assistance programs. The Ninth Circuit affirmed both the finding of a Bounds violation and the injunction's major terms.

Held: The success of respondents' systemic challenge was dependent

on their ability to show widespread actual injury, and the District
Court's failure to identify anything more than isolated instances of
actual injury renders its finding of a systemic Bounds violation invalid. Pp. 348-364.

(a) Bounds did not create an abstract, freestanding right to a law
library or legal assistance; rather, the right that Bounds acknowledged
was the right of access to the courts. E. g., 430 U. S., at 817, 821, 828.
Thus, to establish a Bounds violation, the "actual injury" that an inmate
must demonstrate is that the alleged shortcomings in the prison library
or legal assistance program have hindered, or are presently hindering,
his efforts to pursue a nonfrivolous legal claim. This requirement derives ultimately from the doctrine of standing. Although Bounds made
no mention of an actual injury requirement, it can hardly be thought to
have eliminated that constitutional prerequisite. Pp. 349-353.

(b) Statements in Bounds suggesting that prison authorities must
also enable the prisoner to discover grievances, and to litigate effectively once in court, 430 U. S., at 825-826, and n. 14, have no antecedent
in this Court's pre-Bounds cases, and are now disclaimed. Moreover,
Bounds does not guarantee inmates the wherewithal to file any and
every type of legal claim, but requires only that they be provided with
the tools to attack their sentences, directly or collaterally, and to challenge the conditions of their confinement. Pp. 354-355.

344 LEWIS v. CASEY

Syllabus
(c) The District Court identified only two instances of actual injury:
It found that ADOC's failures with respect to illiterate prisoners had
resulted in the dismissal with prejudice of inmate Bartholic's lawsuit
and the inability of inmate Harris to file a legal action. Pp. 356-357.

(d) These findings as to injury do not support the systemwide injunction ordered by the District Court. The remedy must be limited to
the inadequacy that produced the injury in fact that the plaintiff has
established; that this is a class action changes nothing, for even named
plaintiffs in a class action must show that they personally have been
injured, see, e. g., Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization,
426 U. S. 26, 40, n. 20. Only one named plaintiff, Bartholic, was found
to have suffered actual injury--as a result of ADOC's failure to provide
the special services he would have needed, in light of his particular
disability (illiteracy), to avoid dismissal of his case. Eliminated from
the proper scope of the injunction, therefore, are provisions directed at
special services or facilities required by non-English speakers, by prisoners in lockdown, and by the inmate population at large. Furthermore, the inadequacy that caused actual injury to illiterate inmates
Bartholic and Harris was not sufficiently widespread to justify systemwide relief. There is no finding, and no evidence discernible from the
record, that in ADOC prisons other than those occupied by Bartholic
and Harris illiterate inmates cannot obtain the minimal help necessary
to file legal claims. Pp. 357-360.

(e) There are further reasons why the order here cannot stand. In
concluding that ADOC's restrictions on lockdown inmates were unjustified, the District Court failed to accord the judgment of prison authorities the substantial deference required by cases such as Turner v.
Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 89. The court also failed to leave with prison
officials the primary responsibility for devising a remedy. Compare
Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 492. The result of this improper
procedure was an inordinately intrusive order. Pp. 361-363.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
In Bounds v. Smith, 430 U. S. 817 (1977), we held that "thefundamental constitutional right of access to the courts requires prison authorities to assist inmates in the preparationand filing of meaningful legal papers by providing prisoners
with adequate law libraries or adequate assistance from per-sons trained in the law." Id., at 828. Petitioners, who are
officials of the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADOC),contend that the United States District Court for the
District of Arizona erred in finding them in violation ofBounds, and that the court's remedial order exceeded lawful authority. I

Respondents are 22 inmates of various prisons operatedby ADOC. In January 1990, they filed this class action "on
behalf of all adult prisoners who are or will be incarceratedby the State of Arizona Department of Corrections," App.
22, alleging that petitioners were "depriving [respondents]of their rights of access to the courts and counsel protected
by the First, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments," id., at 34.Following a 3-month bench trial, the District Court ruled
in favor of respondents, finding that "[p]risoners have a con-stitutional right of access to the courts that is adequate,
effective and meaningful," 834 F. Supp. 1553, 1566 (1992),citing Bounds, supra, at 822, and that "[ADOC's] system fails
to comply with constitutional standards," 834 F. Supp., at1569. The court identified a variety of shortcomings of the
ADOC system, in matters ranging from the training of li-brary staff, to the updating of legal materials, to the availability of photocopying services. In addition to these genDefense and Educational Fund et al. by David Fernandez and Michael R.

Opinion of the Court
eral findings, the court found that two groups of inmates
were particularly affected by the system's inadequacies:
"[l]ockdown prisoners" (inmates segregated from the general prison population for disciplinary or security reasons),
who "are routinely denied physical access to the law library"
and "experience severe interference with their access to the
courts," id., at 1556; and illiterate or non-English-speaking
inmates, who do not receive adequate legal assistance, id.,
at 1558.

Having thus found liability, the court appointed a Special
Master "to investigate and report about" the appropriate
relief--that is (in the court's view), "how best to accomplish
the goal of constitutionally adequate inmate access to
the courts." App. to Pet. for Cert. 87a. Following eight
months of investigation, and some degree of consultation
with both parties, the Special Master lodged with the court
a proposed permanent injunction, which the court proceeded
to adopt, substantially unchanged. The 25-page injunctive
order, see id., at 61a-85a, mandated sweeping changes designed to ensure that ADOC would "provide meaningful access to the Courts for all present and future prisoners," id.,
at 61a. It specified in minute detail the times that libraries
were to be kept open, the number of hours of library use to
which each inmate was entitled (10 per week), the minimal
educational requirements for prison librarians (a library science degree, law degree, or paralegal degree), the content of
a videotaped legal-research course for inmates (to be prepared by persons appointed by the Special Master but funded
by ADOC), and similar matters. Id., at 61a, 67a, 71a. The
injunction addressed the court's concern for lockdown prisoners by ordering that "ADOC prisoners in all housing areas
and custody levels shall be provided regular and comparable
visits to the law library," except that such visits "may be
postponed on an individual basis because of the prisoner's
documented inability to use the law library without creating

a threat to safety or security, or a physical condition if de-termined by medical personnel to prevent library use." Id.,

at 61a. With respect to illiterate and non-English-speakinginmates, the injunction declared that they were entitled to
"direct assistance" from lawyers, paralegals, or "a sufficientnumber of at least minimally trained prisoner Legal Assistants"; it enjoined ADOC that "[p]articular steps must betaken to locate and train bilingual prisoners to be Legal
Assistants." Id., at 69a-70a.Petitioners sought review in the Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit, which refused to grant a stay prior to argu-ment. We then stayed the injunction pending filing and disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari. 511 U. S. 1066(1994). Several months later, the Ninth Circuit affirmed
both the finding of a Bounds violation and, with minor excep-tions not important here, the terms of the injunction. 43 F.
3d 1261 (1994). We granted certiorari, 514 U. S. 1126 (1995).

II
Although petitioners present only one question for review,namely, whether the District Court's order "exceeds the constitutional requirements set forth in Bounds," Brief for Peti-tioners (i), they raise several distinct challenges, including
renewed attacks on the court's findings of Bounds violationswith respect to illiterate, non-English-speaking, and lockdown prisoners, and on the breadth of the injunction. Buttheir most fundamental contention is that the District
Court's findings of injury were inadequate to justify thefinding of systemwide injury and hence the granting of systemwide relief. This argument has two related components.First, petitioners claim that in order to establish a violation
of Bounds, an inmate must show that the alleged inadequa-cies of a prison's library facilities or legal assistance program
caused him "actual injury"--that is, "actual prejudice withrespect to contemplated or existing litigation, such as the
inability to meet a filing deadline or to present a claim."

349Cite as: 518 U. S. 343 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
Brief for Petitioners 30.1 Second, they claim that the Dis-trict Court did not find enough instances of actual injury to

warrant systemwide relief. We agree that the success ofrespondents' systemic challenge was dependent on their ability to show widespread actual injury, and that the court'sfailure to identify anything more than isolated instances of
actual injury renders its finding of a systemic Bounds violation invalid. A

The requirement that an inmate alleging a violation of
Bounds must show actual injury derives ultimately from the
doctrine of standing, a constitutional principle that preventscourts of law from undertaking tasks assigned to the political

branches. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 750-752(1984);

Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United
for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 471-476 (1982). It is the role of courts to provide relief to claimants, in individual or class actions, who have suffered, or will
imminently suffer, actual harm; it is not the role of courts,but that of the political branches, to shape the institutions of

government in such fashion as to comply with the laws andthe Constitution. In the context of the present case: It is
for the courts to remedy past or imminent official interfer-ence with individual inmates' presentation of claims to the
courts; it is for the political branches of the State and FederalGovernments to manage prisons in such fashion that official
interference with the presentation of claims will not occur.

1 Respondents contend that petitioners failed properly to present their
"actual injury" argument to the Court of Appeals. Brief for Respondents
25-26. Our review of petitioners' briefs before that court leads us to conclude otherwise, and in any event, as we shall discuss, the point relates to
standing, which is jurisdictional and not subject to waiver. See United
States v. Hays, 515 U. S. 737, 742 (1995); FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S.
215, 230-231 (1990). Justice Souter recognizes the jurisdictional nature of this point, post, at 394, which is difficult to reconcile with his view
that we should not "reach out to address" it, ibid.

350 LEWIS v. CASEY

Opinion of the Court
Of course, the two roles briefly and partially coincide whena court, in granting relief against actual harm that has been

suffered, or that will imminently be suffered, by a particularindividual or class of individuals, orders the alteration of an
institutional organization or procedure that causes the harm.
But the distinction between the two roles would be obliter-ated if, to invoke intervention of the courts, no actual or imminent harm were needed, but merely the status of beingsubject to a governmental institution that was not organized
or managed properly. If--to take another example fromprison life--a healthy inmate who had suffered no deprivation of needed medical treatment were able to claim violation
of his constitutional right to medical care, see Estelle v.
Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 103 (1976), simply on the ground that
the prison medical facilities were inadequate, the essential
distinction between judge and executive would have disappeared: it would have become the function of the courts to
assure adequate medical care in prisons.

The foregoing analysis would not be pertinent here if, as
respondents seem to assume, the right at issue--the right to
which the actual or threatened harm must pertain--were the
right to a law library or to legal assistance. But Bounds
established no such right, any more than Estelle established
a right to a prison hospital. The right that Bounds acknowledged was the (already well-established) right of access to the courts. E. g., Bounds, 430 U. S., at 817, 821, 828.
In the cases to which Bounds traced its roots, we had protected that right by prohibiting state prison officials from
actively interfering with inmates' attempts to prepare legal
documents, e. g., Johnson v. Avery, 393 U. S. 483, 484, 489-
490 (1969), or file them, e. g., Ex parte Hull, 312 U. S. 546,
547-549 (1941), and by requiring state courts to waive filing
fees, e. g., Burns v. Ohio, 360 U. S. 252, 258 (1959), or transcript fees, e. g., Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S. 12, 19 (1956), for
indigent inmates. Bounds focused on the same entitlement
of access to the courts. Although it affirmed a court order

518us2$81K 05-20-99 06:36:11 PAGES OPINPGT

351Cite as: 518 U. S. 343 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
requiring North Carolina to make law library facilities available to inmates, it stressed that that was merely "one constitutionally acceptable method to assure meaningful access to
the courts," and that "our decision here . . . does not foreclose
alternative means to achieve that goal." 430 U. S., at 830.
In other words, prison law libraries and legal assistance programs are not ends in themselves, but only the means for
ensuring "a reasonably adequate opportunity to present
claimed violations of fundamental constitutional rights to the
courts." Id., at 825.

Because Bounds did not create an abstract, freestanding
right to a law library or legal assistance, an inmate cannot
establish relevant actual injury simply by establishing that
his prison's law library or legal assistance program is subpar
in some theoretical sense. That would be the precise analog
of the healthy inmate claiming constitutional violation because of the inadequacy of the prison infirmary. Insofar as
the right vindicated by Bounds is concerned, "meaningful
access to the courts is the touchstone," id., at 823 (internal
quotation marks omitted), and the inmate therefore must go
one step further and demonstrate that the alleged shortcomings in the library or legal assistance program hindered his
efforts to pursue a legal claim. He might show, for example,
that a complaint he prepared was dismissed for failure to
satisfy some technical requirement which, because of deficiencies in the prison's legal assistance facilities, he could not
have known. Or that he had suffered arguably actionable
harm that he wished to bring before the courts, but was so
stymied by inadequacies of the law library that he was unable even to file a complaint.

Although Bounds itself made no mention of an actualinjury requirement, it can hardly be thought to have eliminated that constitutional prerequisite. And actual injury is
apparent on the face of almost all the opinions in the 35-year
line of access-to-courts cases on which Bounds relied, see id.,

Opinion of the Court
at 821-825.2 Moreover, the assumption of an actual-injuryrequirement seems to us implicit in the opinion's statement

that "we encourage local experimentation" in various meth-ods of assuring access to the courts. Id., at 832. One such
experiment, for example, might replace libraries with someminimal access to legal advice and a system of courtprovided forms such as those that contained the originalcomplaints in two of the more significant inmate-initiated
cases in recent years, Sandin v. Conner, 515 U. S. 472 (1995),and

Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S. 1 (1992)--forms thatasked the inmates to provide only the facts and not to attempt any legal analysis. We hardly think that what wemeant by "experimenting" with such an alternative was simply announcing it, whereupon suit would immediately lie todeclare it theoretically inadequate and bring the experiment
to a close. We think we envisioned, instead, that the new

2 Justice Stevens suggests that Ex parte Hull, 312 U. S. 546 (1941),
establishes that even a lost frivolous claim establishes standing to complain of a denial of access to courts, see post, at 408-409. As an initial
matter, that is quite impossible, since standing was neither challenged nor
discussed in that case, and we have repeatedly held that the existence of
unaddressed jurisdictional defects has no precedential effect. See, e. g.,
Federal Election Comm'n v. NRA Political Victory Fund, 513 U. S. 88,
97 (1994); United States v. More, 3 Cranch 159, 172 (1805) (Marshall, C. J.)
(statement at oral argument). On the merits, however, it is simply not
true that the prisoner's claim in Hull was frivolous. We rejected it because it had been procedurally defaulted by, inter alia, failure to object at
trial and failure to include a transcript with the petition, 312 U. S., at 551.
If all procedurally defaulted claims were frivolous, Rule 11 business would
be brisk indeed. Justice Stevens's assertion that "we held that the
smuggled petition had insufficient merit even to require an answer from
the State," post, at 408-409, is misleading. The attorney general of Michigan appeared in the case, and our opinion discussed the merits of the claim
at some length, see 312 U. S., at 549-551. The posture of the case was
such, however, that we treated the claim "as a motion for leave to file a
petition for writ of habeas corpus," id., at 550; after analyzing petitioner's
case, we found it "insufficient to compel an order requiring the warden
to answer," id., at 551 (emphasis added). That is not remotely equivalent
to finding that the underlying claim was frivolous.

program would remain in place at least until some inmate
could demonstrate that a nonfrivolous 3 legal claim had been
frustrated or was being impeded.4

3 Justice Souter believes that Bounds v. Smith, 430 U. S. 817 (1977),
guarantees prison inmates the right to present frivolous claims--the determination of which suffices to confer standing, he says, because it assumes that the dispute " `will be presented in an adversary context and in
a form historically viewed as capable of judicial resolution,' " post, at 398-
399, quoting Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, 101 (1968). This would perhaps
have seemed like good law at the time of Flast, but our later opinions
have made it explicitly clear that Flast erred in assuming that assurance
of "serious and adversarial treatment" was the only value protected by
standing. See, e. g., United States v. Richardson, 418 U. S. 166, 176-180
(1974); Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U. S. 208,
220-223 (1974). Flast failed to recognize that this doctrine has a
separation-of-powers component, which keeps courts within certain traditional bounds vis-a`-vis the other branches, concrete adverseness or not.
That is where the "actual injury" requirement comes from. Not everyone
who can point to some "concrete" act and is "adverse" can call in the courts
to examine the propriety of executive action, but only someone who has
been actually injured. Depriving someone of an arguable (though not
yet established) claim inflicts actual injury because it deprives him of
something of value--arguable claims are settled, bought, and sold. Depriving someone of a frivolous claim, on the other hand, deprives him of
nothing at all, except perhaps the punishment of Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 11 sanctions.

4 Justice Souter suggests that he would waive this actual-injury requirement in cases "involving substantial, systemic deprivation of access
to court"--that is, in cases involving " `a direct, substantial and continuous
. . . limit on legal materials,' " "total denial of access to a library," or " `[a]n
absolute deprivation of access to all legal materials,' " post, at 401, and
400, n. 2. That view rests upon the expansive understanding of Bounds
that we have repudiated. Unless prisoners have a freestanding right to
libraries, a showing of the sort Justice Souter describes would establish no relevant injury in fact, i. e., injury-in-fact caused by the violation
of legal right. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751 (1984). Denial of
access to the courts could not possibly cause the harm of inadequate libraries, but only the harm of lost, rejected, or impeded legal claims.

Of course, Justice Souter's proposed exception is unlikely to be of
much real-world significance in any event. Where the situation is so
extreme as to constitute "an absolute deprivation of access to all legal

Opinion of the Court
It must be acknowledged that several statements inBounds went beyond the right of access recognized in the

earlier cases on which it relied, which was a right to bringto court a grievance that the inmate wished to present, see,
e. g., Ex parte Hull, 312 U. S., at 547-548; Griffin v. Illinois,351 U. S., at 13-16;

Johnson v. Avery, 393 U. S., at 489.These statements appear to suggest that the State must

enable the prisoner to discover grievances, and to litigateeffectively once in court. See Bounds, 430 U. S., at 825-826,
and n. 14. These elaborations upon the right of access tothe courts have no antecedent in our pre-Bounds cases, and
we now disclaim them. To demand the conferral of such so-phisticated legal capabilities upon a mostly uneducated and
indeed largely illiterate prison population is effectively todemand permanent provision of counsel, which we do not
believe the Constitution requires.Finally, we must observe that the injury requirement is
not satisfied by just any type of frustrated legal claim.Nearly all of the access-to-courts cases in the

Bounds lineinvolved attempts by inmates to pursue direct appeals from

the convictions for which they were incarcerated, see Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353, 354 (1963); Burns v. Ohio,360 U. S., at 253, 258; Griffin v. Illinois, supra, at 13, 18;

Cochran v. Kansas, 316 U. S. 255, 256 (1942), or habeas peti-tions, see Johnson v. Avery, supra, at 489; Smith v. Bennett,
365 U. S. 708, 709-710 (1961); Ex parte Hull, supra, at 547-548. In

Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539 (1974), we ex-tended this universe of relevant claims only slightly, to "civil

rights actions"--i. e., actions under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 tovindicate "basic constitutional rights." 418 U. S., at 579.
Significantly, we felt compelled to justify even this slight ex-tension of the right of access to the courts, stressing that
"the demarcation line between civil rights actions and hamaterials," finding a prisoner with a claim affected by this extremity will
probably be easier than proving the extremity.

beas petitions is not always clear," and that "[i]t is futile tocontend that the Civil Rights Act of 1871 has less importance

in our constitutional scheme than does the Great Writ."
Ibid. The prison law library imposed in Bounds itself was
far from an all-subject facility. In rejecting the contention
that the State's proposed collection was inadequate, the Dis-trict Court there said:

"This Court does not feel inmates need the entire
U. S. Code Annotated. Most of that code deals withfederal laws and regulations that would never involve a

state prisoner. . . .

"It is also the opinion of this Court that the cost ofN. C. Digest and Modern Federal Practice Digest will

surpass the usefulness of these research aids. Theycover mostly areas not of concern to inmates."

5 Supplemental App. to Pet. for Cert. in Bounds v. Smith,O. T. 1976, No. 75-915, p. 18.

In other words, Bounds does not guarantee inmates the
wherewithal to transform themselves into litigating engines
capable of filing everything from shareholder derivative ac-tions to slip-and-fall claims. The tools it requires to be provided are those that the inmates need in order to attack theirsentences, directly or collaterally, and in order to challenge
the conditions of their confinement. Impairment of any
other litigating capacity is simply one of the incidental (and
perfectly constitutional) consequences of conviction and
incarceration.

5 The District Court order in this case, by contrast, required ADOC to
stock each library with, inter alia, the Arizona Digest, the Modern Federal Practice Digest, Corpus Juris Secundum, and a full set of the United
States Code Annotated, and to provide a 30-40 hour videotaped legal research course covering "relevant tort and civil law, including immigration
and family issues." App. to Pet. for Cert. 69a, 71a; 834 F. Supp. 1553,

Opinion of the Court

B
Here the District Court identified only two instances ofactual injury. In describing ADOC's failures with respect

to illiterate and non-English-speaking prisoners, it foundthat "[a]s a result of the inability to receive adequate legal
assistance, prisoners who are slow readers have had theircases dismissed with prejudice," and that "[o]ther prisoners
have been unable to file legal actions." 834 F. Supp., at 1558.Although the use of the plural suggests that several prisoners sustained these actual harms, the court identified onlyone prisoner in each instance. Id., at 1558, nn. 37 (lawsuit
of inmate Bartholic dismissed with prejudice), 38 (inmateHarris unable to file a legal action).

Petitioners contend that "any lack of access experiencedby these two inmates is not attributable to unconstitutional
State policies," because ADOC "has met its constitutionalobligations." Brief for Petitioners 32, n. 22. The claim
appears to be that all inmates, including the illiterate andnon-English speaking, have a right to nothing more than
"physical access to excellent libraries, plus help from legalassistants and law clerks."

Id., at 35. This misreadsBounds, which as we have said guarantees no particular

methodology but rather the conferral of a capability--thecapability of bringing contemplated challenges to sentences
or conditions of confinement before the courts. When anyinmate, even an illiterate or non-English-speaking inmate,
shows that an actionable claim of this nature which he de-sired to bring has been lost or rejected, or that the presentation of such a claim is currently being prevented, becausethis capability of filing suit has not been provided, he demonstrates that the State has failed to furnish "adequate lawlibraries or adequate assistance from persons trained in the
law," Bounds, 430 U. S., at 828 (emphasis added). Of course,we leave it to prison officials to determine how best to ensure
that inmates with language problems have a reasonably ade-quate opportunity to file nonfrivolous legal claims challenging their convictions or conditions of confinement. But it is

Opinion of the Court
that capability, rather than the capability of turning pages ina law library, that is the touchstone.

C
Having rejected petitioners' argument that the injuriessuffered by Bartholic and Harris do not count, we turn to

the question whether those injuries, and the other findingsof the District Court, support the injunction ordered in this
case. The actual-injury requirement would hardly serve thepurpose we have described above--of preventing courts
from undertaking tasks assigned to the political branches--if once a plaintiff demonstrated harm from one particular
inadequacy in government administration, the court wereauthorized to remedy

all inadequacies in that administration.The remedy must of course be limited to the inadequacy that

produced the injury in fact that the plaintiff has established.See

Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U. S. 70, 88, 89 (1995) ("[T]henature of the . . . remedy is to be determined by the nature

and scope of the constitutional violation" (citation and inter-nal quotation marks omitted)).

This is no less true with respect to class actions than withrespect to other suits. "That a suit may be a class action
. . . adds nothing to the question of standing, for even namedplaintiffs who represent a class `must allege and show that
they personally have been injured, not that injury has beensuffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which
they belong and which they purport to represent.' " Simonv.

Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U. S. 26,40, n. 20 (1976), quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 502

(1975). The general allegations of the complaint in the pres-ent case may well have sufficed to claim injury by named
plaintiffs, and hence standing to demand remediation, withrespect to various alleged inadequacies in the prison system,
including failure to provide adequate legal assistance to non-English-speaking inmates and lockdown prisoners. That
point is irrelevant now, however, for we are beyond thepleading stage.

358 LEWIS v. CASEY

Opinion of the Court
"Since they are not mere pleading requirements, butrather an indispensable part of the plaintiff 's case, each

element [of standing] must be supported in the sameway as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears
the burden of proof, i. e., with the manner and degree ofevidence required at the successive stages of the litigation. At the pleading stage, general factual allegationsof injury resulting from the defendant's conduct may
suffice, for on a motion to dismiss we presume that gen-eral allegations embrace those specific facts that are
necessary to support the claim. In response to a sum-mary judgment motion, however, the plaintiff can no
longer rest on such mere allegations, but must set forthby affidavit or other evidence specific facts, which for
purposes of the summary judgment motion will be takento be true. And at the final stage, those facts (if controverted) must be supported adequately by the evidenceadduced at trial." Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504
U. S. 555, 561 (1992) (citations and internal quotationmarks omitted).

After the trial in this case, the court found actual injury onthe part of only one named plaintiff, Bartholic; and the cause
of that injury--the inadequacy which the suit empoweredthe court to remedy--was failure of the prison to provide the
special services that Bartholic would have needed, in light ofhis illiteracy, to avoid dismissal of his case. At the outset,
therefore, we can eliminate from the proper scope of thisinjunction provisions directed at special services or special
facilities required by non-English speakers, by prisoners inlockdown, and by the inmate population at large. If inadequacies of this character exist, they have not been found tohave harmed any plaintiff in this lawsuit, and hence were not
the proper object of this District Court's remediation.6

6 Justice Stevens concludes, in gross, that Bartholic's and Harris's injuries are "sufficient to satisfy any constitutional [standing] concerns," post,
at 408. But standing is not dispensed in gross. If the right to complain

359Cite as: 518 U. S. 343 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
As to remediation of the inadequacy that caused Barthol-ic's injury, a further question remains: Was that inadequacy

widespread enough to justify systemwide relief? The onlyfindings supporting the proposition that, in all of ADOC's
facilities, an illiterate inmate wishing to file a claim would beunable to receive the assistance necessary to do so were (1)
the finding with respect to Bartholic, at the Florence facility,and (2) the finding that Harris, while incarcerated at Perryville, had once been "unable to file [a] legal actio[n]." 834F. Supp., at 1558. These two instances were a patently inadequate basis for a conclusion of systemwide violation andimposition of systemwide relief. See

Dayton Bd. of Ed. v.
Brinkman, 433 U. S. 406, 417 (1977) ("[I]nstead of tailoringa remedy commensurate with the three specific violations,

the Court of Appeals imposed a systemwide remedy goingbeyond their scope"); id., at 420 ("[O]nly if there has been a
systemwide impact may there be a systemwide remedy");
of one administrative deficiency automatically conferred the right to complain of all administrative deficiencies, any citizen aggrieved in one respect
could bring the whole structure of state administration before the courts
for review. That is of course not the law. As we have said, "[n]or does
a plaintiff who has been subject to injurious conduct of one kind possess
by virtue of that injury the necessary stake in litigating conduct of another
kind, although similar, to which he has not been subject." Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U. S. 991, 999 (1982). As even Justice Souter concedes, the
inability of respondents to produce any evidence of actual injury to other
than illiterate inmates (Bartholic and Harris) "dispose[s] of the challenge
to remedial orders insofar as they touch non-English speakers and lockdown prisoners." Post, at 395.

Contrary to Justice Stevens's suggestion, see post, at 408, n. 4, our
holding that respondents lacked standing to complain of injuries to nonEnglish speakers and lockdown prisoners does not amount to "a conclusion
that the class was improper." The standing determination is quite separate from certification of the class. Again, Blum proves the point: In that
case, we held that a class of " `all residents of skilled nursing and health
related nursing facilities in New York State who are recipients of Medicaid
benefits' " lacked standing to challenge transfers to higher levels of care,
even though they had standing to challenge discharges and transfers to
lower levels; but we did not disturb the class definition. See 457 U. S., at
997, n. 11, 999-1002.

Opinion of the Court
Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 702 (1979) ("[T]he scopeof injunctive relief is dictated by the extent of the violation

established, not by the geographical extent of the plaintiffclass").

To be sure, the District Court also noted that "the trialtestimony . . . indicated that there are prisoners who are
unable to research the law because of their functional illiter-acy," 834 F. Supp., at 1558. As we have discussed, however,
the Constitution does not require that prisoners (literate orilliterate) be able to conduct generalized research, but only
that they be able to present their grievances to the courts--a more limited capability that can be produced by a much
more limited degree of legal assistance. Apart from the dis-missal of Bartholic's claim with prejudice, and Harris's inability to file his claim, there is no finding, and as far as wecan discern from the record no evidence, that in Arizona prisons illiterate prisoners cannot obtain the minimal help neces-sary to file particular claims that they wish to bring before
the courts. The constitutional violation has not been shownto be systemwide, and granting a remedy beyond what was
necessary to provide relief to Harris and Bartholic wastherefore improper.

7

7 Our holding regarding the inappropriateness of systemwide relief for
illiterate inmates does not rest upon the application of standing rules, but
rather, like Justice Souter's conclusion, upon "the respondents' failure
to prove that denials of access to illiterate prisoners pervaded the State's
prison system," post, at 397. In one respect, however, Justice Souter's
view of this issue differs from ours. He believes that systemwide relief
would have been appropriate "[h]ad the findings shown libraries in shambles throughout the prison system," ibid. That is consistent with his
view, which we have rejected, that lack of access to adequate library facilities qualifies as relevant injury in fact, see n. 4, supra.

Contrary to Justice Souter's assertion, post, at 397, the issue of systemwide relief has nothing to do with the law governing class actions.
Whether or not a class of plaintiffs with frustrated nonfrivolous claims
exists, and no matter how extensive this class may be, unless it was established that violations with respect to that class occurred in all institutions
of Arizona's system, there was no basis for a remedial decree imposed

There are further reasons why the order here cannotstand. We held in

Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78 (1987), thata prison regulation impinging on inmates' constitutional

rights "is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate peno-logical interests." Id., at 89. Such a deferential standard
is necessary, we explained,

"if `prison administrators . . . , and not the courts, [are]to make the difficult judgments concerning institutional

operations.' Subjecting the day-to-day judgments ofprison officials to an inflexible strict scrutiny analysis
would seriously hamper their ability to anticipate secu-rity problems and to adopt innovative solutions to the
intractable problems of prison administration." Ibid.(citation omitted), quoting Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc., 433 U. S. 119, 128 (1977).
These are the same concerns that led us to encourage "localexperimentation" in

Bounds, see supra, at 352, and we thinkit quite obvious that Bounds and Turner must be read in

pari materia.The District Court here failed to accord adequate deference to the judgment of the prison authorities in at leastthree significant respects. First, the court concluded that
ADOC's restrictions on lockdown prisoners' access to law li-braries were unjustified.

Turner's principle of deferencehas special force with regard to that issue, since the inmates

in lockdown include "the most dangerous and violent prison-ers in the Arizona prison system," and other inmates presenting special disciplinary and security concerns. Brief forPetitioners 5. The District Court made much of the fact

upon all those institutions. However inadequate the library facilities may
be as a theoretical matter, various prisons may have other means (active
assistance from "jailhouse lawyers," complaint forms, etc.) that suffice to
prevent the legal harm of denial of access to the courts. Courts have no
power to presume and remediate harm that has not been established.

518us2$81K 05-20-99 06:36:11 PAGES OPINPGT
362 LEWIS v. CASEY

Opinion of the Court
that lockdown prisoners routinely experience delays in receiving legal materials or legal assistance, some as long as
16 days, 834 F. Supp., at 1557, and n. 23, but so long as they
are the product of prison regulations reasonably related to
legitimate penological interests, such delays are not of constitutional significance, even where they result in actual injury (which, of course, the District Court did not find here).

Second, the injunction imposed by the District Court was
inordinately--indeed, wildly--intrusive. There is no need
to belabor this point. One need only read the order, see
App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a-85a, to appreciate that it is the ne
plus ultra of what our opinions have lamented as a court's
"in the name of the Constitution, becom[ing] . . . enmeshed
in the minutiae of prison operations." Bell v. Wolfish, 441
U. S. 520, 562 (1979).

Finally, the order was developed through a process that
failed to give adequate consideration to the views of state
prison authorities. We have said that "[t]he strong considerations of comity that require giving a state court system that
has convicted a defendant the first opportunity to correct its
own errors . . . also require giving the States the first opportunity to correct the errors made in the internal administration of their prisons." Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475,
492 (1973). For an illustration of the proper procedure in a
case such as this, we need look no further than Bounds itself.
There, after granting summary judgment for the inmates,
the District Court refrained from " `dictat[ing] precisely
what course the State should follow.' " Bounds, 430 U. S.,
at 818. Rather, recognizing that "determining the `appropriate relief to be ordered . . . presents a difficult problem,' "
the court " `charge[d] the Department of Correction with the
task of devising a Constitutionally sound program' to assure
inmate access to the courts." Id., at 818-819. The State
responded with a proposal, which the District Court ultimately approved with minor changes, after considering ob518us2$81K 05-20-99 06:36:11 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
jections raised by the inmates. Id., at 819-820. We praisedthis procedure, observing that the court had "scrupulously

respected the limits on [its] role," by "not . . . thrust[ing]itself into prison administration" and instead permitting
"[p]rison administrators [to] exercis[e] wide discretion withinthe bounds of constitutional requirements."

Id., at 832-833.As Bounds was an exemplar of what should be done, this

case is a model of what should not. The District Court to-tally failed to heed the admonition of Preiser. Having found
a violation of the right of access to the courts, it conferredupon its special master, a law professor from Flushing, New
York, rather than upon ADOC officials, the responsibility fordevising a remedial plan. To make matters worse, it severely limited the remedies that the master could choose.Because, in the court's view, its order in an earlier access-tocourts case (an order that adopted the recommendations ofthe same special master) had "resolved successfully" most of
the issues involved in this litigation, the court instructedthat as to those issues it would implement the earlier order
statewide, "with any modifications that the parties and Spe-cial Master determine are necessary due to the particular
circumstances of the prison facility." App. to Pet. for Cert.88a (footnote omitted). This will not do. The State was
entitled to far more than an opportunity for rebuttal, and onthat ground alone this order would have to be set aside.

8

8 Justice Stevens believes that the State of Arizona "is most to blame
for the objectionable character of the final [injunctive] order," post, at 411,
for two reasons: First, because of its lack of cooperation in prison litigation
three to five years earlier before the same judge, see Gluth v. Kangas, 773
F. Supp. 1309 (Ariz. 1988). But the rule that federal courts must "giv[e]
the States the first opportunity to correct the errors made in the internal
administration of their prisons," Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 492
(1973), is not to be set aside when a judge decides that a State was insufficiently cooperative in a different, earlier case. There was no indication
of obstructive tactics by the State in the present case, from which one
ought to have concluded that the State had learned its lesson. Second,

Thomas, J., concurring

* * *
For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of theCourt of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Thomas, concurring.
The Constitution charges federal judges with decidingcases and controversies, not with running state prisons.

Yet, too frequently, federal district courts in the name of theConstitution effect wholesale takeovers of state correctional
facilities and run them by judicial decree. This case is atextbook example. Dissatisfied with the quality of the law
libraries and the legal assistance at Arizona's correctionalinstitutions, the District Court imposed a statewide decree
on the Arizona Department of Corrections (ADOC), dictat-ing in excruciatingly minute detail a program to assist inmates in the filing of lawsuits--right down to permissiblenoise levels in library reading rooms. Such gross overreaching by a federal district court simply cannot be tolerated inour federal system. Principles of federalism and separation
of powers dictate that exclusive responsibility for adminis-tering state prisons resides with the State and its officials.

Justice Stevens contends that the State failed vigorously to oppose application of the Gluth methodology to the present litigation. But surely
there was no reasonable doubt that the State objected to that methodology. Justice Stevens demands from the State, we think, an unattainable degree of courage and foolishness in insisting that, having been punished for its recalcitrance in the earlier case by the imposition of the Gluth
methodology, it antagonize the District Court further by "zealously" insisting that that methodology, recently vindicated on appeal, must be
abandoned. It sufficed, we think, for the State to submit for the record
at every turn that "Defendants' objections and suggestions for modifications shall not be deemed a waiver of these Defendants' right to appeal

Of course, prison officials must maintain their facilitiesconsistent with the restrictions and obligations imposed by

the Constitution. In Bounds v. Smith, 430 U. S. 817 (1977),we recognized as part of the State's constitutional obligations a duty to provide prison inmates with law libraries orother legal assistance at state expense, an obligation we described as part of a loosely defined "right of access to thecourts" enjoyed by prisoners. While the Constitution may
guarantee state inmates an opportunity to bring suit to vin-dicate their federal constitutional rights, I find no basis in
the Constitution--and Bounds cited none--for the right tohave the government finance the endeavor.

I join the majority opinion because it places sensible andmuch-needed limitations on the seemingly limitless right to
assistance created in Bounds and because it clarifies thescope of the federal courts' authority to subject state prisons
to remedial decrees. I write separately to make clear mydoubts about the validity of Bounds and to reiterate my observation in Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U. S. 70 (1995), that thefederal judiciary has for the last half century been exercising
"equitable" powers and issuing structural decrees entirelyout of line with its constitutional mandate.

A

This case is not about a right of "access to the courts."There is no proof that Arizona has prevented even a single

inmate from filing a civil rights lawsuit or submitting a peti-tion for a writ of habeas corpus. Instead, this case is about
the extent to which the Constitution requires a State to fi-nance or otherwise assist a prisoner's efforts to bring suit
against the State and its officials.In

Bounds v. Smith, supra, we recognized for the firsttime a "fundamental constitutional right" of all inmates to

have the State "assist [them] in the preparation and filing ofmeaningful legal papers." Id., at 828. We were not explicit

as to the forms the State's assistance must take, but we didhold that, at a minimum, States must furnish prisoners "with

adequate law libraries or adequate assistance from personstrained in the law."

Ibid. Although our cases prior to
Bounds occasionally referenced a constitutional right of access to the courts, we had never before recognized a free-standing constitutional right that requires the States to

"shoulder affirmative obligations," id., at 824, in order to "in-sure that inmate access to the courts is adequate, effective,
and meaningful," id., at 822.Recognition of such broad and novel principles of constitutional law are rare enough under our system of law that I
would have expected the Bounds Court to explain at length
the constitutional basis for the right to state-provided legal
materials and legal assistance. But the majority opinion in
Bounds failed to identify a single provision of the Constitution to support the right created in that case, a fact that did
not go unnoticed in strong dissents by Chief Justice Burger
and then-Justice Rehnquist. See id., at 833-834 (opinion
of Burger, C. J.) ("The Court leaves us unenlightened as to
the source of the `right of access to the courts' which it perceives or of the requirement that States `foot the bill' for
assuring such access for prisoners who want to act as legal
researchers and brief writers"); id., at 840 (opinion of Rehnquist, J.) ("[T]he `fundamental constitutional right of access
to the courts' which the Court announces today is created
virtually out of whole cloth with little or no reference to the
Constitution from which it is supposed to be derived"). The
dissents' calls for an explanation as to which provision of the
Constitution guarantees prisoners a right to consult a law
library or a legal assistant, however, went unanswered.
This is perhaps not surprising: Just three years before
Bounds was decided we admitted that the "[t]he precise rationale" for many of the "access to the courts" cases on which
Bounds relied had "never been explicitly stated," and that
no Clause that had thus far been advanced "by itself provides

an entirely satisfactory basis for the result reached." Rossv. Moffitt, 417 U. S. 600, 608-609 (1974).

The weakness in the Court's constitutional analysis inBounds is punctuated by our inability, in the 20 years since,
to agree upon the constitutional source of the supposed right.We have described the right articulated in

Bounds as a "con-sequence" of due process, Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U. S.

1, 11, n. 6 (1989) (plurality opinion) (citing Procunier v. Mar-tinez, 416 U. S. 396, 419 (1974)), as an "aspect" of equal protection, 492 U. S., at 11, n. 6 (citation omitted), or as an "equalprotection guarantee," Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S.
551, 557 (1987). In no instance, however, have we engagedin rigorous constitutional analysis of the basis for the asserted right. Thus, even as we endeavor to address thequestion presented in this case--whether the District
Court's order "exceeds the constitutional requirements setforth in

Bounds," Pet. for Cert. i--we do so without knowingwhich Amendment to the Constitution governs our inquiry.

It goes without saying that we ordinarily require moreexactitude when evaluating asserted constitutional rights.
"As a general matter, the Court has always been reluctant"to extend constitutional protection to "unchartered area[s],"
where the "guideposts for responsible decisionmaking . . .are scarce and open-ended."

Collins v. Harker Heights, 503U. S. 115, 125 (1992). It is a bedrock principle of judicial

restraint that a right be lodged firmly in the text or traditionof a specific constitutional provision before we will recognize
it as fundamental. Strict adherence to this approach is es-sential if we are to fulfill our constitutionally assigned role
of giving full effect to the mandate of the Framers withoutinfusing the constitutional fabric with our own political
views. B

In lieu of constitutional text, history, or tradition, Boundsturned primarily to precedent in recognizing the right to

claims. Our cases, however, had never recognized a right ofthe kind articulated in Bounds, and, in my opinion, could not

reasonably have been read to support such a right. Priorto Bounds, two lines of cases dominated our so-called "access
to the courts" jurisprudence. One of these lines, rootedlargely in principles of equal protection, invalidated state filing and transcript fees and imposed limited affirmative obli-gations on the States to ensure that their criminal procedures did not discriminate on the basis of poverty. Thesecases recognized a right to

equal access, and any affirmativeobligations imposed (e. g., a free transcript or counsel on a

first appeal as of right) were strictly limited to ensuringequality of access, not access in its own right. In a second
line of cases, we invalidated state prison regulations thatrestricted or effectively prohibited inmates from filing habeas corpus petitions or civil rights lawsuits in federal courtto vindicate federally protected rights. While the cases in
this line did guarantee a certain amount of access to the fed-eral courts, they imposed no affirmative obligations on the
States to facilitate access, and held only that States may not"abridge or impair" prisoners' efforts to petition a federal
court for vindication of federal rights. Ex parte Hull, 312U. S. 546, 549 (1941). Without pausing to consider either the
reasoning behind, or the constitutional basis for, each ofthese independent lines of case law, the Court in Bounds
engaged in a loose and selective reading of our precedentsas it created a freestanding and novel right to statesupported legal assistance. Despite the Court's purportedreliance on prior cases,

Bounds in fact represented a majordeparture both from precedent and historical practice.

In a series of cases beginning with Griffin v. Illinois, 351U. S. 12 (1956), the Court invalidated state rules that required indigent criminal defendants to pay for trial tran-scripts or to pay other fees necessary to have their appeals

or habeas corpus petitions heard. According to the BoundsCourt, these decisions "struck down restrictions and required remedial measures to insure that inmate access to thecourts is adequate, effective, and meaningful." 430 U. S., at
822. This is inaccurate. Notwithstanding the suggestionin

Bounds, our transcript and fee cases did not establish afreestanding right of access to the courts, meaningful or

otherwise.In Griffin, for instance, we invalidated an Illinois rule that
charged criminal defendants a fee for a trial transcript neces-sary to secure full direct appellate review of a criminal conviction. See 351 U. S., at 13-14; id., at 22 (Frankfurter, J.,concurring in judgment). See also

Ross v. Moffitt, supra,at 605-606. Though we held the fee to be unconstitutional,

our decision did not turn on the effectiveness or adequacy ofthe access afforded to criminal defendants generally. We
were quite explicit in reaffirming the century-old principlethat "a State is not required by the Federal Constitution to
provide appellate courts or a right to appellate review at
all." Griffin, supra, at 18 (emphasis added) (citing McKanev. Durston, 153 U. S. 684, 687-688 (1894)). Indeed, the

Court in Griffin was unanimous on this point. See 351 U. S.,at 21 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment) ("[I]t is now
settled that due process of law does not require a State toafford review of criminal judgments"); id., at 27 (Burton, J.,
dissenting) ("Illinois, as the majority admit, could thus denyan appeal altogether in a criminal case without denying due
process of law"); id., at 36 (Harlan, J., dissenting) ("The ma-jority of the Court concedes that the Fourteenth Amendment

pronouncement that a State is not constitutionally requiredto provide any court access to criminals who wish to challenge their convictions, the Bounds Court's description ofGriffin as ensuring " `adequate and effective appellate review,' " 430 U. S., at 822 (quoting Griffin, supra, at 20), isunsustainable.

Instead, Griffin rested on the quite different principlethat, while a State is not obliged to provide appeals in criminal cases, the review a State chooses to afford must not beadministered in a way that excludes indigents from the appellate process solely on account of their poverty. There isno mistaking the principle that motivated

Griffin:

"It is true that a State is not required by the FederalConstitution to provide appellate courts or a right to

appellate review at all. But that is not to say that aState that does grant appellate review can do so in a
way that discriminates against some convicted defend-ants on account of their poverty. . . . [A]t all stages of
the proceedings the Due Process and Equal ProtectionClauses protect [indigent persons] from invidious
discriminations. . . .". . . There can be no equal justice where the kind of
trial a man gets depends on the amount of money he has.Destitute defendants must be afforded as adequate appellate review as defendants who have money enough tobuy transcripts." 351 U. S., at 18-19 (plurality opinion)
(citation omitted).
Justice Frankfurter, who provided the fifth vote for the ma-jority, confirmed in a separate writing that it was invidious

discrimination, and not the denial of adequate, effective, ormeaningful access to the courts, that rendered the Illinois
regulation unconstitutional: "[W]hen a State deems it wise
that a State is not obliged to provide any appeal at all for criminal defendants." 417 U. S., at 606 (citing McKane v. Durston, 153 U. S. 684 (1894)).

and just that convictions be susceptible to review by an ap-pellate court, it cannot by force of its exactions draw a line

which precludes convicted indigent persons . . . from securingsuch a review . . . ." Id., at 23 (opinion concurring in judgment). Thus, contrary to the characterization in Bounds,
Griffin stands not for the proposition that all inmates areentitled to adequate appellate review of their criminal convictions, but for the more modest rule that, if the Statechooses to afford appellate review, it "can no more discriminate on account of poverty than on account of religion, race,or color." Griffin, supra, at 17 (plurality opinion).

If we left any doubt as to the basis of our decision in Grif-fin, we eliminated it two decades later in Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353 (1963), where we held for the first time thatStates must provide assistance of counsel on a first appeal as
of right for all indigent defendants. Like Griffin, Douglasturned not on a right of access

per se, but rather on the rightnot to be denied, on the basis of poverty, access afforded to

others. We did not say in Douglas that indigents have aright to a "meaningful appeal" that could not be realized
absent appointed counsel. Cf. Bounds, 430 U. S., at 823.

2 This is what Justice Brennan came to call the "Griffin equality principle," United States v. MacCollom, 426 U. S. 317, 331 (1976) (dissenting
opinion), and it provided the rationale for a string of decisions that struck
down a variety of state transcript and filing fees as applied to indigent
prisoners. Bounds cited a number of these cases in support of the right
to "adequate, effective and meaningful" access to the courts. See 430
U. S., at 822, and n. 8. But none of the transcript and fee cases on which
Bounds relied were premised on a substantive standard of court access.
Rather, like Griffin, these cases were primarily concerned with invidious
discrimination on the basis of wealth. See, e. g., Smith v. Bennett, 365
U. S. 708, 709 (1961) ("[T]o interpose any financial consideration between
an indigent prisoner of the State and his exercise of a state right to sue
for his liberty is to deny that prisoner the equal protection of the laws");
Gardner v. California, 393 U. S. 367, 370-371 (1969) ("[I]n the context of
California's habeas corpus procedure denial of a transcript to an indigent
marks the same invidious discrimination which we held impermissible in
. . . Griffin").

What we did say is that, in the absence of state-provided
counsel, "[t]here is lacking that equality demanded by the
Fourteenth Amendment where the rich man, who appeals as
of right, enjoys the benefit of counse[l] . . . while the indigent
. . . is forced to shift for himself." Douglas, supra, at 357-
358. Just as in Griffin, where "we held that a State may
not grant appellate review in such a way as to discriminate
against some convicted defendants on account of their poverty," Douglas, 372 U. S., at 355, the evil motivating our decision in Douglas was "discrimination against the indigent,"
ibid.3

3 There is some discussion of due process by the plurality in Griffin, see
351 U. S., at 17-18, and a passing reference to "fair procedure" in Douglas,
372 U. S., at 357. These unexplained references to due process, made in
the course of equal protection analyses, provide an insufficient basis for
concluding that the regulations challenged in Griffin and Douglas independently violated the Due Process Clause. And attempts in subsequent
cases to salvage a role for the Due Process Clause in this context and to
explain the difference between the equal protection and due process analyses in Griffin have, in my opinion, been unpersuasive. See Evitts v.
Lucey, 469 U. S. 387, 402-405 (1985); Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U. S. 660,
665-667 (1983). In any event, there do not appear to have been five votes
in Griffin in support of a holding under the Due Process Clause; subsequent transcript and fee cases turned primarily, if not exclusively, on equal
protection grounds, see, e. g., Smith v. Bennett, supra, at 714; and the
Douglas Court, with its "obvious emphasis" on equal protection, 372 U. S.,
at 361 (Harlan, J., dissenting), does not appear to have reached the due
process question, notwithstanding Justice Harlan's supposition to the contrary, see id., at 360-361.

It is difficult to see how due process could be implicated in these cases,
given our consistent reaffirmation that the States can abolish criminal appeals altogether consistently with due process. See, e. g., Ross v. Moffitt,
417 U. S., at 611. The fact that a State affords some access "does not
automatically mean that a State then acts unfairly," and hence violates
due process, by denying indigents assistance "at every stage of the way."
Ibid. Under our cases, "[u]nfairness results only if indigents are singled
out by the State and denied meaningful access to the appellate system
because of their poverty," a question "more profitably considered under
an equal protection analysis." Ibid.

Our transcript and fee cases were, therefore, limited hold-ings rooted in principles of equal protection. In

Bounds,
these cases were recharacterized almost beyond recognition,as the Court created a new and different right on behalf of

prisoners--a right to have the State pay for law libraries or
other forms of legal assistance without regard to the equalityof access. Only by divorcing our prior holdings from their

reasoning, and by elevating dicta over constitutional princi-ple, was the Court able to reach such a result.

The unjustified transformation of the right to nondiscrimi-natory access to the courts into the broader, untethered right
to legal assistance generally would be reason enough for me
to conclude that Bounds was wrongly decided. However,
even assuming that Bounds properly relied upon the Griffin
line of cases for the proposition for which those cases actually stood, the Bounds Court failed to address a significant
intervening development in our jurisprudence: the fact that
the equal protection theory underlying Griffin and its progeny had largely been abandoned prior to Bounds. The provisions invalidated in our transcript and fee cases were all
facially neutral administrative regulations that had a disparate impact on the poor; there is no indication in any of those
cases that the State imposed the challenged fee with the purpose of deliberately discriminating against indigent defendants. See, e. g., Douglas, supra, at 361 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (criticizing the Court for invalidating a state law "of
general applicability" solely because it "may affect the poor
more harshly than it does the rich"). In the years between
Douglas and Bounds, however, we rejected a disparateimpact theory of the Equal Protection Clause. That the
doctrinal basis for Griffin and its progeny has largely been
undermined--and in fact had been before Bounds was decided--confirms the invalidity of the right to law libraries
and legal assistance created in Bounds.

We first cast doubt on the proposition that a facially neutral law violates the Equal Protection Clause solely because

it has a disparate impact on the poor in San Antonio Inde-pendent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1 (1973). In

Rodriguez, the respondents challenged Texas' traditionalsystem of financing public education under the Equal Protection Clause on the ground that, under that system, "somepoorer people receive less expensive educations than other
more affluent people." Id., at 19. In rejecting the claimthat this sort of disparate impact amounted to unconstitutional discrimination, we declined the respondents' invitationto extend the rationale of

Griffin, Douglas, and similar cases.We explained that, under those cases, unless a group claiming discrimination on the basis of poverty can show that it is"

completely unable to pay for some desired benefit, and asa consequence, . . . sustained an absolute deprivation of a

meaningful opportunity to enjoy that benefit," 411 U. S., at20 (emphasis added), strict scrutiny of a classification based
on wealth does not apply. Because the respondents in Rod-riguez had not shown that "the children in districts having
relatively low assessable property values are receiving nopublic education," but rather claimed only that "they are receiving a poorer quality education than that available to chil-dren in districts having more assessable wealth,"

id., at 23(emphasis added), we held that the "Texas system does not

operate to the peculiar disadvantage of any suspect class,"id., at 28. After Rodriguez, it was clear that "wealth discrimination alone [does not] provid[e] an adequate basis forinvoking strict scrutiny,"

id., at 29, and that, "at least wherewealth is involved, the Equal Protection Clause does not require absolute equality or precisely equal advantages," id.,at 24. See also Kadrmas v. Dickinson Public Schools, 487
U. S. 450, 458 (1988); Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S. 297, 322-323(1980); Maher v. Roe, 432 U. S. 464, 470-471 (1977).

4 The absence of a prison law library or other state-provided legal assistance can hardly be said to deprive inmates absolutely of an opportunity to
bring their claims to the attention of a federal court. Clarence Earl Gideon, perhaps the most celebrated pro se prisoner litigant of all time, was

We rejected a disparate-impact theory of the Equal Pro-tection Clause altogether in Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S.

229, 239 (1976), decided just one Term before Bounds.There we flatly rejected the idea that "a law, neutral on its
face and serving ends otherwise within the power of govern-ment to pursue, is invalid under the Equal Protection Clause
simply because it may affect a greater proportion of one racethan of another." 426 U. S., at 242. We held that, absent
proof of discriminatory purpose, a law or official act does notviolate the Constitution "

solely because it has a . . . dispro-portionate impact." Id., at 239 (emphasis in original). See

also id., at 240 (acknowledging "the basic equal protectionprinciple that the invidious quality of a law claimed to be
racially discriminatory must ultimately be traced to a ra-cially discriminatory purpose"). At bottom,

and was incarcerated in a prison that apparently did not provide prisoners
with lawbooks. See Answer to Respondent's Response to Pet. for Cert.
in Gideon v. Wainwright, O. T. 1962, No. 155, p. 1 ("[T]he petitioner is not
a [sic] attorney or versed in law nor does not have the law books to copy
down the decisions of this Court. . . . Nor would the petitioner be allowed
to do so").

Like anyone else seeking to bring suit without the assistance of the
State, prisoners can seek the advice of an attorney, whether pro bono or
paid, and can turn to family, friends, other inmates, or public interest
groups. Inmates can also take advantage of the liberal pleading rules for
pro se litigants and the liberal rules governing appointment of counsel.
Federal fee-shifting statutes and the promise of a contingency fee should
also provide sufficient incentive for counsel to take meritorious cases.

5 Our decisions in San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez,

411 U. S. 1 (1973), and Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229 (1976), validated
the position taken by Justice Harlan in his dissents in Griffin v. Illinois,
351 U. S. 12 (1956), and Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353 (1963). As
Justice Harlan persuasively argued in Douglas, facially neutral laws that
disproportionately impact the poor "do not deny equal protection to the
less fortunate for one essential reason: the Equal Protection Clause does
not impose on the States `an affirmative duty to lift the handicaps flowing
from differences in economic circumstances.' To so construe it would be

The Davis Court was motivated in no small part by thepotentially radical implications of the

Griffin/Douglas rationale. As Justice Harlan recognized in Douglas: "Everyfinancial exaction which the State imposes on a uniform

basis is more easily satisfied by the well-to-do than by the
indigent." 372 U. S., at 361 (dissenting opinion). Under a
disparate-impact theory, Justice Harlan argued, regulatory
measures always considered to be constitutionally valid, such
as sales taxes, state university tuition, and criminal penalties, would have to be struck down. See id., at 361-362.6
Echoing Justice Harlan, we rejected in Davis the disparateimpact approach in part because of the recognition that "[a]
rule that a statute designed to serve neutral ends is neverto read into the Constitution a philosophy of leveling that would be foreign
to many of our basic concepts of the proper relations between government
and society. The State may have a moral obligation to eliminate the evils
of poverty, but it is not required by the Equal Protection Clause to give
to some whatever others can afford." Id., at 362 (dissenting opinion).
See also Griffin, 351 U. S., at 35-36 (Harlan, J., dissenting); id., at 29 (Burton, J., dissenting) ("The Constitution requires the equal protection of the
law, but it does not require the States to provide equal financial means for
all defendants to avail themselves of such laws").

6 Although he concurred in the judgment in Griffin, Justice Frankfurter

expressed similar concerns. He emphasized that "the equal protection of
the laws [does not] deny a State the right to make classifications in law
when such classifications are rooted in reason," id., at 21, and that "a State
need not equalize economic conditions," id., at 23. Justice Frankfurter
acknowledged that differences in wealth are "contingencies of life which
are hardly within the power, let alone the duty, of a State to correct or
cushion." Ibid. He also expressed concern that if absolute equality
were required, a State would no longer be able to "protect itself so that
frivolous appeals are not subsidized and public moneys not needlessly
spent." Id., at 24. See also United States v. MacCollom, 426 U. S., at
330 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment) (the Constitution does not "require that an indigent be furnished every possible legal tool, no matter
how speculative its value, and no matter how devoid of assistance it may
be, merely because a person of unlimited means might choose to waste his
resources in a quest of that kind").

theless invalid, absent compelling justification, if in practice
it benefits or burdens one race more than another would be
far reaching and would raise serious questions about, and
perhaps invalidate, a whole range of tax, welfare, public
service, regulatory, and licensing statutes that may be more
burdensome to the poor and to the average black than to
the more affluent white." 426 U. S., at 248. See also id.,
at 248, n. 14.

Given the unsettling ramifications of a disparate-impact
theory, it is not surprising that we eventually reached the
point where we could no longer extend the reasoning of Griffin and Douglas. For instance, in Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U. S.
600 (1974), decided just three years before Bounds, we declined to extend Douglas to require States to provide indigents with counsel in discretionary state appeals or in seeking discretionary review in this Court. We explained in
Ross that "[t]he Fourteenth Amendment `does not require
absolute equality or precisely equal advantages,' " 417 U. S.,
at 612 (quoting Rodriguez, 411 U. S., at 24), and that it "does
[not] require the State to `equalize economic conditions,' "
417 U. S., at 612 (quoting Griffin, 351 U. S., at 23 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in judgment)). We again declined to
extend Douglas in Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S., at 555,
where we rejected a claim that the Constitution requires the
States to provide counsel in state postconviction proceedings. And we found Ross and Finley controlling in Murray
v. Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1 (1989), where we held that defendants sentenced to death, like all other defendants, have no
right to state-appointed counsel in state collateral proceedings. See also United States v. MacCollom, 426 U. S. 317
(1976) (federal habeas statute permitting district judge to
deny free transcript to indigent petitioner raising frivolous
claim does not violate the Constitution).

In sum, the Bounds Court's reliance on our transcript and
fee cases was misplaced in two significant respects. First,

those cases did not stand for the proposition for whichBounds cited them: They were about equal access, not access

per se. Second, the constitutional basis for Griffin and itsprogeny had been seriously undermined in the years preceding Bounds. Thus, even to the extent that Bounds intendedto rely on those cases for the propositions for which they
actually stood, their underlying rationale had been largelydiscredited. These cases, rooted in largely obsolete theories
of equal protection, do not support the right to law librariesand legal assistance recognized in

Bounds. Our repeatedholdings declining to extend these decisions only confirm

this conclusion. 2

The Bounds Court relied on a second line of cases in an-nouncing the right to state-financed law libraries or legal
assistance for prisoners. These cases, beginning with ourdecision in

Ex parte Hull, prevent the States from imposingarbitrary obstacles to attempts by prisoners to file claims

asserting federal constitutional rights. Although this linedeals with access in its own right, and not equal access as in
Griffin and Douglas, these cases do not impose any affirma-tive obligations on the States to improve the prisoners'
chances of success.

Bounds identified Ex parte Hull as the first case to "recog-niz[e]" a "constitutional right of access to the courts." 430

U. S., at 821-822. In Ex parte Hull, we considered a prisonregulation that required prisoners to submit their habeas
corpus petitions to a prison administrator before filing themwith the court. Only if the administrator determined that
a petition was " `properly drawn' " could the prisoner submitit in a federal court. 312 U. S., at 548-549 (quoting regulation). We invalidated the regulation, but the right we ac-knowledged in doing so bears no resemblance to the right
generated in Bounds.Our reasoning in

Ex parte Hull consists of a straightfor-ward, and rather limited, principle:

"[T]he state and its officers may not abridge or impairpetitioner's right to apply to a federal court for a writ

of habeas corpus. Whether a petition for writ of habeascorpus addressed to a federal court is properly drawn
and what allegations it must contain are questions for
that court alone to determine." 312 U. S., at 549.

The "right of access" to the courts articulated in Ex parte
Hull thus imposed no affirmative obligations on the States;
we stated only that a State may not "abridge or impair" aprisoner's ability to file a habeas petition in federal court.

Ex parte Hull thus provides an extraordinarily weak start-ing point for concluding that the Constitution requires States

to fund and otherwise assist prisoner legal research by providing law libraries or legal assistance.Two subsequent decisions of this Court worked a moderate

expansion of Ex parte Hull. The first, Johnson v. Avery,393 U. S. 483 (1969), invalidated a Tennessee prison regulation that prohibited inmates from advising or assisting oneanother in the preparation of habeas corpus petitions. In
striking down the regulation, the Court twice quoted Ex

7 The Court's rationale appears to have been motivated more by notions
of federalism and the power of the federal courts than with the rights of
prisoners. Our citation of three nonhabeas cases which held that a state
court's determination on a matter of federal law is not binding on the
Supreme Court supports this conclusion. See Ex parte Hull, 312 U. S.,
at 549, citing First Nat. Bank of Guthrie Center v. Anderson, 269 U. S.
341, 346 (1926) (the power of the Supreme Court to review independently

parte Hull's holding that a State may not "abridge or impair"a petitioner's efforts to file a petition for a writ of habeas

corpus. See 393 U. S., at 486-487, 488. In contrast to Exparte Hull, however, Johnson focused not on the respective
institutional roles of state prisons and the federal courts buton "the fundamental importance of the writ of habeas corpus
in our constitutional scheme." 393 U. S., at 485. Still, theCourt did not hold that the Constitution places an affirmative
obligation on the States to facilitate the filing of habeas peti-tions. The Court held only that a State may not "den[y] or
obstruc[t]" a prisoner's ability to file a habeas petition. Ibid.We extended the holding of

Johnson in Wolff v. McDonnell,418 U. S. 539 (1974), where we struck down a similar regulation that prevented inmates from assisting one another inthe preparation of civil rights complaints. We held that the
"right of access to the courts, upon which Avery was prem-ised, is founded in the Due Process Clause and assures that
no person will be denied the opportunity to present to thejudiciary allegations concerning violations of fundamental
constitutional rights." Id., at 579. Again, the right wasframed exclusively in the negative. See ibid. (opportunity
to file a civil rights action may not be "denied"). Thus, priorto Bounds, "if a prisoner incarcerated pursuant to a final
judgment of conviction [was] not prevented from physical ac-cess to the federal courts in order that he may file therein
petitions for relief which Congress has authorized thosecourts to grant, he ha[d] been accorded the only constitutional right of access to the courts that our cases ha[d] articu-lated in a reasoned way."

That Ex parte Hull, Johnson, and Wolff were decided ondifferent constitutional grounds from Griffin and Douglas is

clear enough. According to Bounds, however, "[e]ssentiallythe same standards of access were applied" in all of these

cases. 430 U. S., at 823. This observation was wrong, butthe equation of these two lines of cases allowed the

Bounds
Court to preserve the "affirmative obligations" element ofthe equal access cases, the rationale of which had largely

been undermined prior to Bounds, by linking it with Ex
parte Hull, which had not been undermined by later casesbut which imposed no affirmative obligations. In the process, Bounds forged a right with no basis in precedent orconstitutional text: a right to have the State "shoulder affirmative obligations" in the form of law libraries or legalassistance to ensure that prisoners can file meaningful lawsuits. By detaching Griffin's right to equal access and Ex
parte Hull's right to physical access from the reasoning on
which each of these rights was based, the Bounds Court created a virtually limitless right. And though the right was
framed in terms of law libraries and legal assistance in that
case, the reasoning is much broader, and this Court should
have been prepared under the Bounds rationale to require
the appointment of capable state-financed counsel for any
inmate who wishes to file a lawsuit. See Bounds, supra, at
841 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (observing that "the logical
destination of the Court's reasoning" in Bounds is "lawyers
appointed at the expense of the State"). See also ante, at
354. We have not, however, extended Bounds to its logical
conclusion. And though we have not overruled Bounds, we
have undoubtedly repudiated its reasoning in our consistent
rejection of the proposition that the States must provide
counsel beyond the trial and first appeal as of right. See
Ross, 417 U. S., at 612; Finley, 481 U. S., at 555; Giarratano,
492 U. S., at 3-4 (plurality opinion).

In the end, I agree that the Constitution affords prisoners
what can be termed a right of access to the courts. That
right, rooted in the Due Process Clause and the principle
articulated in Ex parte Hull, is a right not to be arbitrarily
prevented from lodging a claimed violation of a federal right
in a federal court. The State, however, is not constitution518us2$81N 05-20-99 06:36:11 PAGES OPINPGT

ally required to finance or otherwise assist the prisoner's ef-forts, either through law libraries or other legal assistance.

Whether to expend state resources to facilitate prisoner law-suits is a question of policy and one that the Constitution
leaves to the discretion of the States.

There is no basis in history or tradition for the propositionthat the State's constitutional obligation is any broader. Although the historical record is relatively thin, those whohave explored the development of state-sponsored legal assistance for prisoners agree that, until very recently, lawlibraries in prisons were "nearly nonexistent." A. Flores,
Werner's Manual for Prison Law Libraries 1 (2d ed. 1990).
Prior to Bounds, prison library collections (to the extent
prisons had libraries) commonly reflected the correctional
goals that a State wished to advance, whether religious, educational, or rehabilitative. Although some institutions may
have begun to acquire a minimal collection of legal materials
in the early part of this century, lawbooks generally were
not included in prison libraries prior to the 1950's. See W.
Coyle, Libraries in Prisons 54-55 (1987). The exclusion of
lawbooks was consistent with the recommendation of the
American Prison Association, which advised prison administrators nationwide to omit federal and state lawbooks from
prison library collections. See American Prison Association, Objectives and Standards for Libraries in Adult Prisons
and Reformatories, in Library Manual for Correctional Institutions 101, 106-107 (1950). The rise of the prison law library and other legal assistance programs is a recent phenomenon, and one generated largely by the federal courts.

of state-sponsored legal assistance for prisoners, Bounds wasin fact a major "disruption to traditional prison operation."

Vogel, supra, at 87.The idea that prisoners have a legal right to the assistance
that they were traditionally denied is also of recent vintage.
The traditional, pre-Bounds view of the law with regard tothe State's obligation to facilitate prisoner lawsuits by providing law libraries and legal assistance was articulated in
Hatfield v. Bailleaux, 290 F. 2d 632 (CA9), cert. denied, 368
U. S. 862 (1961):

"State authorities have no obligation under the federal
Constitution to provide library facilities and an opportu-nity for their use to enable an inmate to search for legal

loopholes in the judgment and sentence under which heis held, or to perform services which only a lawyer is
trained to perform. All inmates are presumed to beconfined under valid judgments and sentences. If an
inmate believes he has a meritorious reason for attacking his, he must be given an opportunity to do so. Buthe has no due process right to spend his prison time or

utilize prison facilities in an effort to discover a groundfor overturning a presumptively valid judgment.

"Inmates have the constitutional right to waive coun-sel and act as their own lawyers, but this does not mean
that a non-lawyer must be given the opportunity to ac-quire a legal education. One question which an inmate
must decide in determining if he should represent himself is whether in view of his own competency and gen-eral prison regulations he can do so adequately. He

must make the decision in the light of the circumstances
existing. The state has no duty to alter the circumstances to conform with his decision." 290 F. 2d, at
640-641.

Consistent with the traditional view, the lower courts understood the Constitution only to guarantee prisoners a right

to be free from state interference in filing papers with thecourts:

"[A]ccess to the courts means the opportunity to pre-pare, serve and file whatever pleadings or other documents are necessary or appropriate in order to com-mence or prosecute court proceedings affecting one's
personal liberty, or to assert and sustain a defensetherein, and to send and receive communications to and
from judges, courts and lawyers concerning such mat-ters."

See also Oaks v. Wainwright, 430 F. 2d 241, 242 (CA5 1970)(affirming dismissal of prisoner's complaint alleging denial of

access to library and legal materials on ground that prisonerhad not alleged that "he has in any way been denied access
to the courts . . . , that he has ever lost the right to commence, prosecute or appeal in any court, or that he has beensubstantially delayed in obtaining a judicial determination in

any proceeding"). Thus, while courts held that a prisoneris entitled to attack his sentence without state interference,
they also consistently held that "[p]rison regulations are notrequired to provide prisoners with the time, the correspondence privileges, the materials or other facilities they desirefor the special purpose of trying to find some way of making
attack upon the presumptively valid judgments against
them." Lee v. Tahash, 352 F. 2d 970, 973 (CA8 1965). "Ifthe purpose was not to hamper inmates in gaining reasonable

access to the courts with regard to their respective criminalmatters, and if the regulations and practices do not interfere
with such reasonable access," the inquiry was at an end.

A

Even when compared to the federal judicial overreaching
to which we have now become accustomed, this is truly a
remarkable case. The District Court's order vividly demonstrates the danger of continuing to afford federal judges the
virtually unbridled equitable power that we have for too long
sanctioned. We have here yet another example of a federal
judge attempting to "direc[t] or manag[e] the reconstruction
of entire institutions and bureaucracies, with little regard
for the inherent limitations on [his] authority." Missouri v.
Jenkins, 515 U. S., at 126 (Thomas, J., concurring). And we
will continue to see cases like this unless we take more serious steps to curtail the use of equitable power by the federal courts.

Principles of federalism and separation of powers impose
stringent limitations on the equitable power of federal
courts. When these principles are accorded their proper respect, Article III cannot be understood to authorize the Federal Judiciary to take control of core state institutions like
prisons, schools, and hospitals, and assume responsibility for
making the difficult policy judgments that state officials are
both constitutionally entitled and uniquely qualified to make.
See id., at 131-133. Broad remedial decrees strip state administrators of their authority to set long-term goals for the
institutions they manage and of the flexibility necessary to
make reasonable judgments on short notice under difficult
circumstances. See Sandin v. Conner, 515 U. S. 472, 482-
483 (1995). At the state level, such decrees override the
"State's discretionary authority over its own program and
budgets and forc[e] state officials to reallocate state resources and funds to the [district court's] plan at the expense
of other citizens, other government programs, and other in518us2$81N 05-20-99 06:36:11 PAGES OPINPGT

stitutions not represented in court." Jenkins, 515 U. S., at
131 (Thomas, J., concurring). The federal judiciary is ill
equipped to make these types of judgments, and the Framers
never imagined that federal judges would displace state
executive officials and state legislatures in charting state
policy.

Though we have sometimes closed our eyes to federal judicial overreaching, as in the context of school desegregation,
see id., at 124-125, we have been vigilant in opposing sweeping remedial decrees in the context of prison administration.
"It is difficult to imagine an activity in which a State has a
stronger interest, or one that is more intricately bound up
with state laws, regulations, and procedures, than the administration of its prisons." Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475,
491-492 (1973). In this area, perhaps more than any other,
we have been faithful to the principles of federalism and separation of powers that limit the Federal Judiciary's exercise
of its equitable powers in all instances.

Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U. S. 396 (1974), articulated the
governing principles:

"Traditionally, federal courts have adopted a broad
hands-off attitude toward problems of prison administration. In part this policy is the product of various limitations on the scope of federal review of conditions in state
penal institutions. More fundamentally, this attitude
springs from complementary perceptions about the nature of the problems and the efficacy of judicial intervention. Prison administrators are responsible for maintaining internal order and discipline, for securing their
institutions against unauthorized access or escape, and
for rehabilitating, to the extent that human nature and
inadequate resources allow, the inmates placed in their
custody. The Herculean obstacles to effective discharge
of these duties are too apparent to warrant explication.
Suffice it to say that the problems of prisons in America

are complex and intractable, and, more to the point, theyare not readily susceptible of resolution by decree.

Most require expertise, comprehensive planning, and thecommitment of resources, all of which are peculiarly
within the province of the legislative and executivebranches of government. For all of those reasons,
courts are ill equipped to deal with the increasinglyurgent problems of prison administration and reform.
Judicial recognition of that fact reflects no more than ahealthy sense of realism. Moreover, where state penal
institutions are involved, federal courts have a furtherreason for deference to the appropriate prison authorities." Id., at 404-405 (footnotes omitted).8
State prisons should be run by the state officials with theexpertise and the primary authority for running such institutions. Absent the most "extraordinary circumstances,"Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc., 433
U. S. 119, 137 (1977) (Burger, C. J., concurring), federal courtsshould refrain from meddling in such affairs. Prison administrators have a difficult enough job without federal-courtintervention. An overbroad remedial decree can make an
already daunting task virtually impossible.9

8 Martinez was overruled on other grounds in Thornburgh v. Abbott,
490 U. S. 401, 413-414 (1989). We have consistently reaffirmed Martinez,
however, in all respects relevant to this case, namely, that "the judiciary
is `ill equipped' to deal with the difficult and delicate problems of prison
management" and that prison administrators are entitled to "considerable
deference." 490 U. S., at 407-408. See also Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S.
78, 84-85 (1987) (relying on Martinez for the principle that " `courts are
ill equipped to deal with the increasingly urgent problems of prison administration and reform' " (citation omitted)).

9 The constitutional and practical concerns identified in Martinez have

also resulted in a more deferential standard of review for prisoner claims
of constitutional violations. In Turner v. Safley, we held that a prison
regulation is valid if it is "reasonably related to legitimate penological
interests," even when it "impinges on inmates' constitutional rights." 482
U. S., at 89. A deferential standard was deemed necessary to keep the

I realize that judges, "no less than others in our society,have a natural tendency to believe that their individual solutions to often intractable problems are better and moreworkable than those of the persons who are actually charged
with and trained in the running of the particular institutionunder examination."

Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 562(1979). But judges occupy a unique and limited role, one

that does not allow them to substitute their views for thosein the executive and legislative branches of the various
States, who have the constitutional authority and institu-tional expertise to make these uniquely nonjudicial decisions
and who are ultimately accountable for these decisions.Though the temptation may be great, we must not succumb.
The Constitution is not a license for federal judges to furthersocial policy goals that prison administrators, in their discretion, have declined to advance.

The District Court's opinion and order demonstrate littlerespect for the principles of federalism, separation of powers,

judgment would be subject to the possibility that some court somewhere
would conclude that it had a less restrictive way of solving the problem
at hand. Courts inevitably would become the primary arbiters of what
constitutes the best solution to every administrative problem, thereby `unnecessarily perpetuat[ing] the involvement of the federal courts in affairs
of prison administration.' " Ibid. (quoting Martinez, 416 U. S., at 407).

sweeping remedial order of this nature would be inappropriate in any case. That the violation sought to be remedied
was so minimal, to the extent there was any violation at all,
makes this case all the more alarming.

The District Court cited only one instance of a prison
inmate having a case dismissed due to the State's alleged
failure to provide sufficient assistance, and one instance of
another inmate who was unable to file an action. See 834
F. Supp. 1553, 1558, and nn. 37-38 (Ariz. 1992). All of the
other alleged "violations" found by the District Court related
not to court access, but to library facilities and legal assistance. Many of the found violations were trivial, such as a
missing pocket part to a small number of volumes in just a
few institutions. Id., at 1562. And though every facility in
the Arizona system already contained law libraries that
greatly exceeded prisoner needs,10 the District Court found
the State to be in violation because some of its prison libraries lacked Pacific Second Reporters. Ibid. The District
Court also struck down regulations that clearly pass muster
under Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78 (1987), such as restrictions at some facilities on "brows[ing] the shelves," 834

at 1561, every facility in the Arizona correctional system had at least one
library containing, at a minimum, the following volumes: United States
Code Annotated; Supreme Court Reporter; Federal Reporter Second;
Federal Supplement; Shepard's U. S. Citations; Shepard's Federal Citations; Local Rules for the Federal District Court; Modern Federal Practice

dient prisoners in the prison population, id., at 1556, and theallowance of phone calls only for "legitimate pressing legal

issues," id., at 1564.To remedy these and similar "violations," the District
Court imposed a sweeping, indiscriminate, and systemwide
decree. The microscopically detailed order leaves no stoneunturned. It covers everything from training in legal research to the ratio of typewriters to prisoners in each facility.It dictates the hours of operation for all prison libraries
statewide, without regard to inmate use, staffing, or cost.It guarantees each prisoner a minimum two-hour visit to the
library per trip, and allows the prisoner, not prison officials,
to determine which reading room he will use. The order
tells ADOC the types of forms it must use to take and respond to prisoner requests for materials. It requires all librarians to have an advanced degree in library science, law,
or paralegal studies. If the State wishes to remove a prisoner from the law library for disciplinary reasons, the order
requires that the prisoner be provided written notice of the
reasons and factual basis for the decision within 48 hours of
removal. The order goes so far as to dictate permissible
noise levels in law library reading rooms and requires the
State to "take all necessary steps, and correct any structural
or acoustical problems." App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a.

The order also creates a "legal assistance program," imposing rules for the selection and retention of prisoner legal
assistants. Id., at 69a. It requires the State to provide all
inmates with a 30-40 hour videotaped legal research course,
covering everything from habeas corpus and claims under 42
U. S. C. $ 1983 to torts, immigration, and family law. Prisoner legal assistants are required to have an additional 20
hours of live instruction. Prisoners are also entitled to a
minimum of three 20-minute phone calls each week to an
attorney or legal organization, without regard to the purpose
for the call; the order expressly requires Arizona to install
extra phones to accommodate the increased use. Of course,

legal supplies are covered under the order, which even pro-vides for "ko-rec-type" to correct typographical errors. A

Special Master retains ongoing supervisory power to ensurethat the order is followed.

The District Court even usurped authority over the prison
administrator's core responsibility: institutional security anddiscipline. See

Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S., at 546 ("[M]aintaining institutional security and preserving internal orderand discipline" are the central goals of prison administration). Apparently undeterred by this Court's repeated ad-monitions that security concerns are to be handled by prison
administrators, see, e. g., ibid., the District Court decreed
that "ADOC prisoners in all . . . custody levels shall be provided regular and comparable visits to the law library."
App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a (emphasis added). Only if prison
administrators can "documen[t]" an individual prisoner's "inability to use the law library without creating a threat to
safety or security" may a potentially dangerous prisoner be
kept out of the library, ibid., and even then the decision must
be reported to the Special Master. And since, in the District Court's view, "[a] prisoner cannot adequately use the
law library under restraint, including handcuffs and shackles," id., at 67a, the State is apparently powerless to take
steps to ensure that inmates known to be violent do not injure other inmates or prison guards while in the law library
"researching" their claims. This "one free bite" approach
conflicts both with our case law, see Hewitt v. Helms, 459
U. S. 460, 474 (1983), and with basic common sense. The
District Court apparently misunderstood that a prison is neither a law firm nor a legal aid bureau. Prisons are inherently dangerous institutions, and decisions concerning safety,
order, and discipline must be, and always have been, left to
the sound discretion of prison administrators.

Like the remedial decree in Jenkins, the District Court's
order suffers from flaws characteristic of overly broad remedial decrees. First, "the District Court retained jurisdic518us2$81N 05-20-99 06:36:11 PAGES OPINPGT

tion over the implementation and modification of the reme-dial decree, instead of terminating its involvement after

issuing its remedy." 515 U. S., at 134 (Thomas, J., concur-ring). Arizona correctional officials must continually report
to a Special Master on matters of internal prison administration, and the District Court retained discretion to change therules of the game if, at some unspecified point in the future,

it feels that Arizona has not done enough to facilitate courtaccess. Thus, the District Court has "inject[ed] the judiciary into the day-to-day management of institutions andlocal policies--a function that lies outside of our Article III
competence." Id., at 135. The District Court also "failed
to target its equitable remedies in this case specifically to
cure the harm suffered by the victims" of unconstitutional
conduct. Id., at 136. We reaffirmed in Jenkins that "the
nature of the [equitable] remedy is to be determined by the
nature and scope of the constitutional violation." Id., at 88
(majority opinion) (citation and internal quotation marks
omitted). Yet, in this case, when the District Court found
the law library at a handful of institutions to be deficient, it
subjected the entire system to the requirements of the decree and to ongoing federal supervision. And once it found
that lockdown inmates experienced delays in receiving law
books in some institutions, the District Court required all
facilities statewide to provide physical access to all inmates,
regardless of custody level. And again, when it found that
some prisoners in some facilities were untrained in legal research, the District Court required the State to provide all
inmates in all institutions with a 30-40 hour videotaped
course in legal research. The remedy far exceeded the
scope of any violation, and the District Court far exceeded
the scope of its authority.

The District Court's order cannot stand under any circumstances. It is a stark example of what a district court
should not do when it finds that a state institution has violated the Constitution. Systemwide relief is never appro518us2$81N 05-20-99 06:36:11 PAGES OPINPGT

priate in the absence of a systemwide violation, and eventhen should be no broader and last no longer than necessary

to remedy the discrete constitutional violation.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg and
Justice Breyer join, concurring in part, dissenting inpart, and concurring in the judgment.

I agree with the Court on certain, fundamental points: thecase before us involves an injunction whose scope has not
yet been justified by the factual findings of the DistrictCourt, ante, at 359-360, one that was imposed through a
"process that failed to give adequate consideration to theviews of state prison authorities,"

ante, at 362, and that doesnot reflect the deference we accord to state prison officials

under Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78 (1987), ante, at 361. Al-though I therefore concur in the judgment and in portions
of the Court's opinion, reservations about the Court's treat-ment of standing doctrine and about certain points unnecessary to the decision lead me to write separately.

The question accepted for review was a broadside chal-lenge to the scope of the District Court's order of systemic

or classwide relief, issued in reliance on Bounds v. Smith,430 U. S. 817 (1977), not whether proof of actual injury is

necessary to establish standing to litigate a Bounds claim.The parties' discussions of actual injury, in their petition for
certiorari, in their briefs, and during oral argument, focusedupon the ultimate finding of liability and the scope of the
injunction. Indeed, petitioners specifically stated that "[a]l-though the lack of a showing of injury means that Respondents are not entitled to any relief, the State does not contendthat the Respondents lacked standing to raise these claims
in the first instance. Respondents clearly met the thresholdof an actual case or controversy pursuant to Article III of
the United States Constitution. They simply failed to prove

Opinion of Souter, J.
the existence of a constitutional violation, including causation of injury, that would entitle them to relief." Brief for
Petitioners 33, n. 23.1

While we are certainly free ourselves to raise an issue of
standing as going to Article III jurisdiction, and must do so
when we would lack jurisdiction to deal with the merits, see
Mount Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 278
(1977), there is no apparent question that the standing of at
least one of the class-action plaintiffs suffices for our jurisdiction and no dispute that standing doctrine does not address
the principal issue in the case. We may thus adequately dispose of the basic issue simply by referring to the evidentiary
record. That is what I would do, for my review of the cases
from the Courts of Appeals either treating or bearing on the
subject of Bounds standing convinces me that there is
enough reason for debate about its appropriate elements that
we should reach no final conclusions about it. That is especially true since we have not had the "benefit of briefing
and argument informed by an appreciation of the potential
breadth of the ruling." Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U. S. 70,
139 (1995) (Souter, J., dissenting). Addressing issues of
standing may not amount to the significant breakdown in our
process of orderly adjudication represented by Missouri v.
Jenkins, but the Court does reach out to address a difficult
conceptual question that is unnecessary to resolution of this
case, was never addressed by the District Court or Court of
Appeals, and divides what would otherwise presumably have
been a unanimous Court.

1 Moreover, the issue of actual injury, even as framed by the parties,
received relatively short shrift; only small portions of the parties' briefs
addressed the issue, see Brief for Petitioners 30-33; Reply Brief for
Petitioners 11-13; Brief for Respondents 25-30, and a significant portion
of that discussion concentrated upon whether the issue should even be
addressed by the Court, Reply Brief for Petitioners 12-13; Brief for
Respondents 25-27.

That said, I cannot say that I am convinced that the Courthas fallen into any error by invoking standing to deal with

the District Court's orders addressing claims by and onbehalf of non-English speakers and prisoners in lockdown.
While it is true that the demise of these prisoners' Boundsclaims could be expressed as a failure of proof on the merits
(and I would so express it), it would be equally correct tosee these plaintiffs as losing on standing. "A determination
even at the end of trial that the court is not prepared toaward any remedy that would benefit the plaintiff[s] may be
expressed as a conclusion that the plaintiff[s] lac[k] stand-ing." 13 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice
and Procedure $ 3531.6, p. 478 (2d ed. 1984) (Wright &Miller).

Although application of standing doctrine may for our pur-poses dispose of the challenge to remedial orders insofar as
they touch non-English speakers and lockdown prisoners,standing principles cannot do the same job in reviewing challenges to the orders aimed at providing court access for theilliterate prisoners. One class representative has standing,
as the Court concedes, and with the right to sue thus estab-lished, standing doctrine has no further part to play in considering the illiterate prisoners' claims. More specifically,the propriety of awarding classwide relief (in this case, affecting the entire prison system) does not require a demon-stration that some or all of the unnamed class could themselves satisfy the standing requirements for named plaintiffs.

"[Unnamed plaintiffs] need not make any individualshowing of standing [in order to obtain relief], because

the standing issue focuses on whether the plaintiff isproperly before the court, not whether represented parties or absent class members are properly before thecourt. Whether or not the named plaintiff who meets
individual standing requirements may assert the rightsof absent class members is neither a standing issue nor
an Article III case or controversy issue but depends

rather on meeting the prerequisites of Rule 23 govern-ing class actions." 1 H. Newberg & A. Conte, Newberg

they have standing; the question whether they may be al-lowed to present claims on behalf of others . . . depends not
on standing, but on an assessment of typicality and adequacyof representation"). This analysis is confirmed by our treatment of standing when the case of a named class-action plain-tiff protesting a durational residence requirement becomes
moot during litigation because the requirement becomes sat-isfied; even then the question is not whether suit can proceed
on the standing of some unnamed members of the class, butwhether "the named representative [can continue] to `fairly
and adequately protect the interests of the class.' " Sosnav.

Justice Scalia says that he is not applying a standingrule when he concludes (as I also do) that systemic relief is
inappropriate here. Ante, at 360-361, n. 7. I accept his as-surance. But he also makes it clear, by the same footnote,
that he does not rest his conclusion (as I rest mine) solely onthe failure to prove that in every Arizona prison, or even
in many of them, the State denied court access to illiterateprisoners, a point on which I take it every Member of the
Court agrees. Instead, he explains that a failure to provethat more than two illiterate prisoners suffered prejudice
to nonfrivolous claims is (at least in part) the reason for re-versal. Since he does not intend to be applying his standing
rule in so saying, I assume he is applying a class-action rule(requiring a denial of classwide relief when trial evidence
does not show the existence of a class of injured claimants).But that route is just as unnecessary and complicating as the
route through standing. (Indeed, the distinction betweenstanding and class-action rules might be practically irrele518us2$81M 05-20-99 06:36:11 PAGES OPINPGT

vant in this case, however important as precedent for othercases.)

While the propriety of the order of systemic relief for illit-erate prisoners does not turn on the standing of class members, and certainly need not turn on class-action rules, it
clearly does turn on the respondents' failure to prove thatdenials of access to illiterate prisoners pervaded the State's

prison system. Leaving aside the question whether thatfailure of proof might have been dealt with by reconsidering
the class certification, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(c)(1); General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U. S. 147, 160
(1982); 7B Wright & Miller $ 1785, at 128-136, the state of
the evidence simply left the District Court without an adequate basis for the exercise of its equitable discretion in issuing an order covering the entire system.

The injunction, for example, imposed detailed rules and
requirements upon each of the State's prison libraries, including rules about library hours, supervision of prisoners
within the facilities, request forms, educational and training
requirements for librarians and their staff members, prisoners' access to the stacks, and inventory. Had the findings
shown libraries in shambles throughout the prison system,
this degree of intrusion might have been reasonable. But
the findings included the specific acknowledgment that
"[g]enerally, the facilities appear to have complete libraries."
834 F. Supp. 1553, 1568 (Ariz. 1992). The District Court
found only that certain of the prison libraries did not allow
inmates to browse the shelves, only that some of the volumes
in some of the libraries lacked pocket parts, only that certain
librarians at some of the libraries lacked law or library science degrees, and only that some prison staff members have
no training in legal research. Given that adequately stocked
libraries go far in satisfying the Bounds requirements, it was
an abuse of discretion for the District Court to aggregate
discrete, small-bore problems in individual prisons and to
treat them as if each prevailed throughout the prison system,

398 LEWIS v. CASEY

Opinion of Souter, J.
for the purpose of justifying a broad remedial order coveringvirtually every aspect of each prison library.

Other elements of the injunction were simply unsupportedby any factual finding. The District Court, for example,
made no factual findings about problems prisoners may haveencountered with noise in any library, let alone any findings
that noise violations interfered with prisoners' access to thecourts. Yet it imposed a requirement across the board that
the State correct all "structural or acoustical problems."App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a. It is this overreaching of the
evidentiary record, not the application of standing or evenclass-action rules, that calls for the judgment to be reversed.

Finally, even with regard to the portions of the injunctionbased upon much stronger evidence of a Bounds violation, I
would remand simply because the District Court failed toprovide the State with an ample opportunity to participate
in the process of fashioning a remedy and because it seemsnot to have considered the implications that Turner holds for
this case. For example, while the District Court was cor-rect to conclude that prisoners who experience delays in receiving books and receive only a limited number of books atthe end of that delay have been denied access to the courts,
it is unlikely that a proper application of Turner would havejustified its decision to order the State to grant lockdown
prisoners physical access to the stacks, given the significanceof the State's safety interest in maintaining the lockdown
system and the existence of an alternative, an improvedpaging system, acceptable to the respondents. Brief for
Respondents 39. II

Even if I were to reach the standing question, however, Iwould not adopt the standard the Court has established. In
describing the injury requirement for standing, we have spo-ken of it as essential to an Article III case or controversy
that "the dispute sought to be adjudicated will be presentedin an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as

Opinion of Souter, J.
capable of judicial resolution." Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S. 83,101 (1968). We ask a plaintiff to prove "actual or threatened

injury" to ensure that "the legal questions presented to thecourt will be resolved, not in the rarified atmosphere of a
debating society, but in a concrete factual context conducive
to a realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial ac-tion."

Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United
for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 472(1982).

I do not disagree with the Court that in order to meetthese standards (in a case that does not involve substantial
systemic deprivation of access), a prisoner suing under
Bounds must assert something more than an abstract desire
to have an adequate library or some other access mechanism.
Nevertheless, while I believe that a prisoner must generally
have some underlying claim or grievance for which he seeks
judicial relief, I cannot endorse the standing requirement the
Court now imposes.

On the Court's view, a district court may be required to
examine the merits of each plaintiff 's underlying claim in
order to determine whether he has standing to litigate a
Bounds claim. Ante, at 353, n. 3. The Court would require
a determination that the claim is "nonfrivolous," ante, at 353,
in the legal sense that it states a claim for relief that is at
least arguable in law and in fact. I, in contrast, would go
no further than to require that a prisoner have some concrete
grievance or gripe about the conditions of his confinement,
the validity of his conviction, or perhaps some other problem
for which he would seek legal redress, see Part III-B, infra
(even though a claim based on that grievance might well fail
sooner or later in the judicial process).

There are three reasons supporting this as a sufficient
standard. First, it is the existence of an underlying grievance, not its ultimate legal merit, that gives a prisoner a
concrete interest in the litigation and will thus assure the
serious and adversarial treatment of the Bounds claim.

518us2$81M 05-20-99 06:36:11 PAGES OPINPGT
400 LEWIS v. CASEY

Opinion of Souter, J.
Second, Bounds recognized a right of access for those whoseek adjudication, not just for sure winners or likely winners

or possible winners. See Bounds, 430 U. S., at 824, 825, 828(describing the constitutional right of access without limiting
the right to prisoners with meritorious claims); see also ante,
at 354 (describing the right of access even before Bounds ascovering "a grievance that the inmate wished to present . . ."

(citations omitted)). Finally, insistence on a "nonfrivolousclaim" rather than a "concrete grievance" as a standing requirement will do no more than guarantee a lot of prelimi-nary litigation over nothing. There is no prison system so
blessed as to lack prisoners with nonfrivolous complaints.They will always turn up, or be turned up, and one way or
the other the Bounds litigation will occur.

That last point may be, as the Court says, the answer toany suggestion that there need be no underlying claim requirement for a Bounds claim of complete and systemic denial of all means of court access. But in view of the Courts
of Appeals that have seen the issue otherwise,2 I would cer2 See, e. g., Jenkins v. Lane, 977 F. 2d 266, 268-269 (CA7 1992) (waiving
the requirement that a prisoner prove prejudice "where the prisoner alleges a direct, substantial and continuous, rather than a `minor and indirect,' limit on legal materials" on the ground that "a prisoner without any
access to materials cannot determine the pleading requirements of his
case, including the necessity of pleading prejudice"); cf. Strickler v. Waters, 989 F. 2d 1375, 1385, n. 16 (CA4 1993) (acknowledging the possibility
that injury may be presumed in some situations, e. g., total denial of access
to a library), cert. denied, 510 U. S. 949 (1993); Sowell v. Vose, 941 F. 2d
32, 35 (CA1 1991) (acknowledging that a prisoner may not need to prove
prejudice when he alleges "[a]n absolute deprivation of access to all legal
materials" (emphases in original)). Dispensing with any underlying claim
requirement in such instances would be consistent with the rule of equity
dealing with threatened injury. See, e. g., Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S.
825, 845 (1994) (holding that a prisoner need not suffer physical injury
before obtaining relief because " `[o]ne does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief' " (quoting Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553, 593 (1923))); Helling v. McKinney, 509 U. S. 25, 33 (1993) (observing that prisoners may obtain relief

Opinion of Souter, J.
tainly reserve that issue for the day it might actually beaddressed by the parties in a case before us.

In sum, I would go no further than to hold (in a case notinvolving substantial, systemic deprivation of access to
court) that Article III requirements will normally be satisfied if a prisoner demonstrates that (1) he has a complaint orgrievance, meritorious or not,

3 about the prison system or

the validity of his conviction 4 that he would raise if his li-brary research (or advice, or judicial review of a form complaint, or other means of "access" chosen by the State) wereto indicate that he had an actionable claim; and (2) the access
scheme provided by the prison is so inadequate that he can-not research, consult about, file, or litigate the claim, as the
case may be.

"even though it was not alleged that the likely harm would occur immediately and even though the possible [harm] might not affect all of those [at
risk]" (discussing Hutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678 (1978))). If the State
denies prisoners all access to the courts, it is hardly implausible for a
prisoner to claim a protected stake in opening some channel of access.

3 See Harris v. Young, 718 F. 2d 620, 622 (CA4 1983) ("It is unfair to

force an inmate to prove that he has a meritorious claim which will require
access until after he has had an opportunity to see just what his rights
are"); see also Magee v. Waters, 810 F. 2d 451, 452 (CA4 1987) (suggesting
that a prisoner must identify the "specific problem he wishe[s] to research"); cf. Vandelft v. Moses, 31 F. 3d 794, 798 (CA9 1994) (dismissing a

Bounds claim in part because the prisoner "simply failed to show that the
restrictions on library access had any effect on his access to the court
relative to his personal restraint petition" (emphases in original)), cert.
denied, 516 U. S. 825 (1995); Casteel v. Pieschek, 3 F. 3d 1050, 1056 (CA7
1993) (it is enough if the prisoner merely "identif[ies] the constitutional
right the defendant allegedly violated and the specific facts constituting
the deprivation"); Chandler v. Baird, 926 F. 2d 1057, 1063 (CA11 1991)
("[T]here was no allegation in the complaint or in plaintiff's deposition
that he was contemplating a challenge at that time [of the deprivation] to
the conditions of his confinement"); Martin v. Tyson, 845 F. 2d 1451, 1456

(CA7) (dismissing a claim in part because the prisoner "does not point to
any claim that he was unable to pursue"), cert. denied, 488 U. S. 863 (1988).

accompanying n. 2, supra, and Part III-B, infra.

402 LEWIS v. CASEY

Opinion of Souter, J.
While a more stringent standing requirement would, of
course, serve to curb courts from interference with prison
administration, that legitimate object is adequately served
by two rules of existing law. Bounds itself makes it clear
that the means of providing access is subject to the State's
own choice. If, for example, a State wishes to avoid judicial
review of its library standards and the adequacy of library
services, it can choose a means of access involving use of
the complaint-form procedure mentioned by the Court today.
Ante, at 352. And any judicial remedy, whatever the chosen
means of court access, must be consistent with the rule in
Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78 (1987), that prison restrictions
are valid if reasonably related to valid penological interests.
Turner's level of scrutiny surely serves to limit undue intrusions and thus obviates the need for further protection. In
the absence of evidence that the Turner framework does not
adequately channel the discretion of federal courts, there
would be no reason to toughen standing doctrine to provide
an additional, and perhaps unnecessary, protection against
this danger.

But instead of relying on these reasonable and existing
safeguards against interference, the Court's resolution of
this case forces a district court to engage in extensive and,
I believe, needless enquiries into the underlying merit of
prisoners' claims during the initial and final stages of a trial,
and renders properly certified classes vulnerable to constant
challenges throughout the course of litigation. The risk is
that district courts will simply conclude that prisoner class
actions are unmanageable. What, at the least, the Court
overlooks is that a class action lending itself to a systemwide
order of relief consistent with Turner avoids the multiplicity
of separate suits and remedial orders that undermine the
efficiency of a United States district court just as surely
as it can exhaust the legal resources of a much-sued state
prison system.

A
There are, finally, two additional points on which I dis-agree with the Court. First, I cannot concur in the suggestion that Bounds should be overruled to the extent that itrequires States choosing to provide law libraries for court
access to make them available for a prisoner's use in theperiod between filing a complaint and its final disposition.
Ante, at 354. Bounds stated the obvious reasons for makinglibraries available for these purposes, 430 U. S., at 825-826,
and developments since Bounds have confirmed its reason-ing. With respect to habeas claims, for example, the need
for some form of legal assistance is even more obvious nowthan it was then, because the restrictions developed since
Bounds have created a "substantial risk" that prisoners pro-ceeding without legal assistance will never be able to obtain
review of the merits of their claims. See McFarland v.Scott, 512 U. S. 849 (1994) (discussing these developments).
Nor should discouragement from the number of frivolousprison suits lead us to doubt the practical justifiability of
providing assistance to a pro se prisoner during trial. Inthe past few years alone, we have considered the petitions
of several prisoners who represented themselves at trial andon appeal, and who ultimately prevailed. See,

e. g., Farmerv. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825 (1994); Helling v. McKinney, 509

U. S. 25 (1993); Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S. 1 (1992).

B
Second, I see no reason at this point to accept the Court'sview that the

Bounds right of access is necessarily restrictedto attacks on sentences or challenges to conditions of confinement. See ante, at 354-355. It is not clear to me thata State may force a prisoner to abandon all opportunities to
vindicate rights outside these two categories no matter howsignificant. We have already held that prisoners do not en518us2$81M 05-20-99 06:36:11 PAGES OPINPGT

tirely forfeit certain fundamental rights, including the rightto marry, Turner v. Safley, supra, at 95; the right to free

speech, Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U. S. 401, 407 (1989); andthe right to free exercise of religion, see O'Lone v. Estate of
Shabazz, 482 U. S. 342 (1987). One can imagine others thatwould arguably entitle a prisoner to some limited right of
access to court. See, e. g., Lassiter v. Department of Social
Servs. of Durham Cty., 452 U. S. 18 (1981) (parental rights);Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U. S. 371 (1971) (divorce); cf.

Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U. S. 33, 49-50 (1950)(deportation). This case does not require us to consider
whether, as a matter of constitutional principle, a prisoner'sopportunities to vindicate rights in these spheres may be
foreclosed, and I would not address such issues here.

IV
I therefore concur in Parts I and III of the Court's opinion,dissent from Part II, and concur in the judgment.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the States from de-priving any person of life, liberty, or property without due

process of law. While at least one 19th-century court char-acterized the prison inmate as a mere "slave of the State,"
Ruffin v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. 790, 796 (1871), in recentdecades this Court has repeatedly held that the convicted
felon's loss of liberty is not total. See Turner v. Safley, 482U. S. 78, 84 (1987);

e. g., Cruz v. Beto, 405 U. S. 319, 321 (1972)."Prison walls do not . . . separat[e] . . . inmates from the

protections of the Constitution," Turner, 482 U. S., at 84, andeven convicted criminals retain some of the liberties enjoyed
by all who live outside those walls in communities to whichmost prisoners will someday return.

Within the residuum of liberty retained by prisoners arefreedoms identified in the First Amendment to the Constitu518us2$81i 05-20-99 06:36:11 PAGES OPINPGT

tion: freedom to worship according to the dictates of theirown conscience, e. g., O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U. S.

342, 348 (1987); Cruz, 405 U. S., at 321, freedom to communi-cate with the outside world, e. g., Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490
U. S. 401, 411-412 (1989), and the freedom to petition theirgovernment for a redress of grievances,

e. g., Johnson v.Avery, 393 U. S. 483, 485 (1969). While the exercise of these

freedoms may of course be regulated and constrained bytheir custodians, they may not be obliterated either actively
or passively. Indeed, our cases make it clear that the Statesmust take certain affirmative steps to protect some of the
essential aspects of liberty that might not otherwise survivein the controlled prison environment.

The "well-established" right of access to the courts, ante,at 350, is one of these aspects of liberty that States must
affirmatively protect. Where States provide for appellatereview of criminal convictions, for example, they have an
affirmative duty to make transcripts available to indigentprisoners free of charge.

Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S. 12,19-20 (1956) (requiring States to waive transcript fees for

indigent inmates); see also Burns v. Ohio, 360 U. S. 252, 257-258 (1959) (requiring States to waive filing fees for indigent
prisoners). It also protects an inmate's right to file com-plaints, whether meritorious or not, see

Ex parte Hull, 312U. S. 546 (1941) (affirming right to file habeas petitions even

if prison officials deem them meritless, in case in which peti-tion at issue was meritless), and an inmate's right to have

the types of legal assistance that they provide to inmates,
ante, at 352--as long as the experiment provides adequateaccess.

The constitutional violations alleged in this case are simi-lar to those that the District Court previously found in one
of Arizona's nine prisons. See Gluth v. Kangas, 773 F. Supp.1309 (Ariz. 1988), aff 'd, 951 F. 2d 1504 (CA9 1991). The complaint in this case was filed in 1990 by 22 prisoners on behalfof a class including all inmates in the Arizona prison system.
The prisoners alleged that the State's institutions providedinadequate access to legal materials or other assistance, App.
31-33, and that as a result, "[p]risoners are harmed by thedenial of meaningful access to the courts."

Id., at 32. TheDistrict Court agreed, concluding that the State had failed,

throughout its prison system, to provide adequate access tolegal materials, particularly for those in administrative segInc. v. NLRB, 461 U. S. 731, 741 (1983) ("[T]he right of access to the courts
is an aspect of the First Amendment right to petition the Government for
redress of grievances"); id., at 743.

The right to claim a violation of a constitutional provision in a manner
that will be recognized by the courts is also embedded in those rights
recognized by the Constitution's text and our interpretations of it. Without the ability to access the courts and draw their attention to constitutionally improper behavior, all of us--prisoners and free citizens alike--
would be deprived of the first--and often the only--"line of defense"
against constitutional violations. Bounds v. Smith, 430 U. S. 817, 828
(1977); see Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S., at 579 (recognition of constitutional rights "would be diluted if inmates, often `totally or functionally illiterate,' were unable to articulate their complaints to the
courts"); cf. Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S.
388 (1971) (allowing plaintiff alleging violation of Fourth Amendment
rights access to the courts through a cause of action directly under the
Constitution).

regation, or "lockdown," and that the State had failed to provide adequate legal assistance to illiterate and non-English
speaking inmates. After giving all the parties an opportunity to participate in the process of drafting the remedy, the
court entered a detailed (and I agree excessively so, see
infra, at 409) order to correct the State's violations.

As I understand the record, the State has not argued that
the right of effective access to the courts, as articulated in
Bounds, should be limited in any way. It has not challenged
the standing of the named plaintiffs to represent the class,
nor has it questioned the propriety of the District Court's
order allowing the case to proceed as a class action. I am
also unaware of any objection having been made in the District Court to the plaintiffs' constitutional standing in this
case, and the State appears to have conceded standing with
respect to most claims in the Court of Appeals.2 Yet the
majority chooses to address these issues unnecessarily and,
in some instances, incorrectly.

For example, although injury in fact certainly is a jurisdictional issue into which we inquire absent objection from the
parties, even the majority finds on the record that at least
two of the plaintiffs had standing in this case, ante, at 356,3

2 See Opening Brief for Appellant in No. 93-17169 (CA9), pp. 29-30;
Reply Brief for Defendant/Appellants in No. 93-17169 (CA9), p. 14, n. 20.
The State directly questioned constitutional standing only with respect to
two narrow classes of claims: the standard for indigency (a claim on which
the State was successful below) and, in its reply brief, photocopying.

3 In all likelihood, the District Court's failure to articulate additional

specific examples of missing claims was due more to the fact that the State
did not challenge the constitutional standing of the prisoners in the District Court than to a lack of actual evidence relating to such lost claims.
Now that the District Court and prisoners are on notice that standing is
a matter of specific concern, it is free on remand to investigate the record
or other evidence that the parties could make available regarding other
claims that have been lost because of inadequate facilities.

which should be sufficient to satisfy any constitutional con-cerns.

4 Yet the Court spends 10 pages disagreeing.

Even if we had reason to delve into standing requirementsin this case, the Court's view of those requirements is excessively strict. I think it perfectly clear that the prisonershad standing, even absent the specific examples of failed
complaints. There is a constitutional right to effective ac-cess, and if a prisoner alleges that he personally has been
denied that right, he has standing to sue.5 One of our firstcases to address directly the right of access to the courts
illustrates this principle particularly well. In Ex parte
Hull, we reviewed the constitutionality of a state prison'srule that impeded an inmate's access to the courts. The rule

authorized corrections officers to intercept mail addressed toa court and refer it to the legal investigator for the parole
board to determine whether there was sufficient merit in theclaim to justify its submission to a court. Meritless claims
were simply not delivered. Petitioner Hull succeeded insmuggling papers to his father, who in turn delivered them
to this Court. Although we held that the smuggled petitionhad insufficient merit even to require an answer from the

4 If named class plaintiffs have standing, the standing of the class members is satisfied by the requirements for class certification. 1 H. Newberg & A. Conte, Newberg on Class Actions $ 2.01, p. 2-3 (3d ed. 1992);
ante, at 395-396 (Souter, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part, and concurring in judgment). Because the State did not challenge that certification, it is rather late in the game to now give it the advantage of a conclusion
that the class was improper (even if it is--although illiterate inmates, it
seems to me, are not positioned much differently with respect to English
language legal materials than are non-English speaking prisoners).

5 Although a prisoner would lose on the merits if he alleged that the

deprivation of that right occurred because the State, for example, did not
provide him with access to on-line computer databases, he would also certainly have "standing" to make his claim. The Court's argument to the
contrary with respect to most of the prisoners in this case, it seems to me,
is not as much an explication of the principles of standing, but the creation
of a new rule requiring prisoners making Bounds claims to demonstrate
prejudice flowing from the lack of access.

State, 312 U. S., at 551, we nevertheless held that the regula-tion was invalid for the simple and sufficient reason that "the

state and its officers may not abridge or impair petitioner'sright to apply to a federal court for writ of habeas corpus."
Id., at 549.At first glance, the novel approach adopted by the Court
today suggests that only those prisoners who have been re-fused the opportunity to file claims later found to have arguable merit should be able to challenge a rule as clearly un-constitutional as the one addressed in

Hull. Perhaps thestandard is somewhat lower than it appears in the first instance; using Hull as an example, the Court suggests thateven facially meritless petitions can provide a sufficient basis
for standing. See ante, at 352, n. 2. Nonetheless, becauseprisoners are uniquely subject to the control of the State, and
because unconstitutional restrictions on the right of access tothe courts--whether through nearly absolute bars like that
in Hull or through inadequate legal resources--frustrate theability of prisoners to identify, articulate, and present to
courts injuries flowing from that control, I believe that anyprisoner who claims to be impeded by such barriers has
alleged constitutionally sufficient injury in fact.My disagreement with the Court is not complete: I am
persuaded--as respondents' counsel essentially has con-ceded--that the relief ordered by the District Court was
broader than necessary to redress the constitutional viola-tions identified in the District Court's findings. I therefore
agree that the case should be remanded. I cannot agree,however, with the Court's decision to use the case as an opportunity to meander through the laws of standing and ac-cess to the courts, expanding standing requirements here
and limiting rights there,6 when the most obvious concern in

6 In addition to the Court's discussion of "standing," the opinion unnecessarily enters into discussion about at least two other aspects of the scope
of the Bounds right. First, the Court concludes that the Bounds right
does not extend to any claims beyond attacks on sentences and conditions

Stevens, J., dissenting
the case is with the simple disjunct between the limitedscope of the injuries articulated in the District Court's findings and the remedy it ordered as a result. Because mostor all of petitioners' concerns regarding the order could be
addressed with a simple remand, I see no need to resolve
the other constitutional issues that the Court reaches outto address.

The Court is well aware that much of its discussion preced-ing Part III is unnecessary to the decision. Reflecting on
its view that the District Court railroaded the State intoaccepting its order lock, stock, and barrel, the Court concludes on the last page of its decision that "[t]he State wasentitled to far more than an opportunity for rebuttal, and on
that ground alone this order would have to be set aside."
Ante, at 363. To the extent that the majority suggests thatthe order in this case is flawed because of a breakdown in the

process of court-supervised negotiation that should generally
precede systemic relief, I agree with it. I also agree that
the failure in that process "alone" would justify a remand

of confinement. Ante, at 355. But given its subsequent finding that only
two plaintiffs have met its newly conjured rule of standing, see ibid., its
conclusion regarding the scope of the right is purely dicta. Second, the
Court argues that the Bounds right does not extend to the right to "discover" grievances, or to "litigate effectively" once in court. Ante, at 354
(emphasis deleted). This statement is also largely unnecessary given the
Court's emphasis in Part III on the need for the District Court both to
tailor its remedy to the constitutional violations it has discovered and the
requirement that it remain respectful of the difficult job faced by state
prison administrators.

Moreover, I note that the State has not asked for these limitations on
Bounds. While I doubt that Arizona will object to its unexpected windfall, its briefs in the District Court, Court of Appeals, and this Court
have argued that the District Court order simply went further than was
necessary given the injuries identified in its own opinion. See Brief for
Petitioners 13-16. By agreeing with that proposition but nonetheless
going on to extend unrequested relief, the Court oversteps the scope of
the debate presented in this case. Whenever we take such a step, we
venture unnecessarily onto dangerous ground.

Stevens, J., dissenting
in this case. I emphatically disagree, however, with theCourt's characterization of who is most to blame for the objectionable character of the final order. Much of the blamefor its breadth, I propose, can be placed squarely in the lap
of the State.

A fair evaluation of the procedures followed in this casemust begin with a reference to

Gluth, the earlier case in
which the same District Judge found petitioners guilty of asystemic constitutional violation in one facility. In that case

the District Court expressly found that the state officials haddemonstrated "a callous unwillingness to face the issues" and
had pursued "diversion[ary] tactics" that "forced [the court]
to take extraordinary measures." 773 F. Supp., at 1312,
1314. Despite the Court's request that they propose an appropriate remedy, the officials refused to do so. It is apparent that these defense tactics played an important role in the
court's decision to appoint a Special Master to assist in the
fashioning of the remedy that was ordered in Gluth. Only
after that order had been affirmed by the Court of Appeals
did respondents commence this action seeking to obtain similar relief for the entire inmate population.

After a trial that lasted for 11 days over the course of two
months, the District Court found that several of petitioners'
policies denied illiterate and non-English-speaking prisoners
meaningful access to the courts. Given the precedent established in Gluth, the express approval of that plan by the
Court of Appeals, and the District Court's evaluation of the
State's conclusions regarding the likelihood of voluntary remedial schemes, particularly in view of the State's unwillingness to play a constructive role in the remedy stage of that
case, the District Court not unreasonably entered an order
appointing the same Special Master and directing him to propose a similar remedy in this case. Although the District
Court instructed the parties to submit specific objections to
the remedial template derived from Gluth, see App. to Pet.
for Cert. 89a, nothing in the court's order prevented the

412 LEWIS v. CASEY

Stevens, J., dissenting
State from submitting its own proposals without waiving itsright to challenge the findings on the liability issues or its

right to object to any remedial proposals by either the Mas-ter or the respondents. The District Court also told the
parties that it would consider settlement offers, and instructed the Master to provide "such guidance and counselas either of the parties may request to effect such a settlement." Id., at 95a.In response to these invitations to participate in the remedial process, the State filed only four half-hearted sets ofwritten objections over the course of the six months during
which the Special Master was evaluating the court's proposed order. See App. 218-221, 225-228, 231-238, and 239-
240. Although the Master rejected about half of these narrow objections, he accepted about an equal number, noting
that the State's limited formal participation had been "important" and "very helpful." Proposed Order (Permanent
Injunction) in No. CIV 90-0054 (D. Ariz.), p. iii. After the
Master released his proposed order, the State offered another round of objections. See App. 243-250. Although
the District Court informed the Master that the objections
could be considered, they did not have to be; the court reasonably noted that the State had been aware for six months
about the potential scope of the order, and that it could have
mounted the same objections prior to the deadline that the
court had set at the beginning of the process. Id., at
251-253.

One might have imagined that the State, faced with the
potential of this "inordinately--indeed, wildly--intrusive"
remedial scheme, ante, at 362, would have taken more care
to protect its interests before the District Court and the
Special Master, particularly given the express willingness
of both to consider the State's objections. Having failed to
zealously represent its interests in the District Court, the
State's present complaints seem rather belated; the Court
has generally been less than solicitous to claims that have

not been adequately pressed below. Cf., e. g., McCleskey v.
Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 488-489 (1991); compare ante, at 363-
364, n. 8 (State made boilerplate reservation of rights ineach set of objections), with

Gray v. Netherland, ante, at
163 ("[I]t is not enough to make a general appeal to a constitutional guarantee as broad as due process to present the`substance' of such a claim to a state court").

The State's lack of interest in representing its interests isclear not only from the sparse objections in the District
Court, but from proceedings both here and in the Court ofAppeals. In argument before both courts, counsel for the
prisoners have conceded that certain aspects of the consent
decree exceeded the necessary relief. See, e. g., 43 F. 3d
1261, 1271 (CA9 1994) (prisoners agree that typewriters are
not required); Tr. of Oral Arg. 31 (provisions regarding noise
in library are unnecessary). This flexibility further suggests that the State could have sought relief from aspects of
the plan through negotiation. Indeed, at oral argument in
the Ninth Circuit, the parties for both sides suggested that
they were willing to settle the case, and the court deferred
submission of the case for 30 days to enable a settlement.
"However, before the settlement process had even begun,
[the State] declined to mediate." 43 F. 3d, at 1265, n. 1.
Notably, this is the only comment made by the appellate
court regarding the process that led to the fashioning of the
remedy in this case.

A fair reading of the record, therefore, reveals that the
State had more than six months within which it could have
initiated settlement discussions, presented more ambitious
objections to the proposed decree reflecting the concerns it
has raised before this Court, or offered up its own plan for
the review of the plaintiffs and the Special Master. It took
none of these steps. Instead, it settled for piecemeal and
belated challenges to the scope of the proposed plan.

The Court implies that the District Court's decision to use
the decree entered in Gluth as the starting point for fashion518us2$81i 05-20-99 06:36:11 PAGES OPINPGT
414 LEWIS v. CASEY

Stevens, J., dissenting
ing the relief to be ordered was unfair to petitioners andshould not be repeated in comparable circumstances. The

browbeaten State, the Court suggests, was "entitled to farmore than an opportunity for rebuttal." Ante, at 363. I
strongly disagree with this characterization of the process.Whether this Court now approves or disapproves of the contents of the Gluth decree, the Court of Appeals had affirmedit in its entirety when this case was tried, and it was surely
appropriate for the District Court to use it as a starting-point for its remedial task in this case. Petitioners were
represented by competent counsel who could have advancedtheir own proposals for relief if they had thought it expedient
to do so. By going further than necessary to correct theexcesses of the order, the Court's decision rewards the State
for the uncooperative posture it has assumed throughout thelong period of litigating both Gluth and this case. See ante,
at 354-355; Gluth, 773 F. Supp., at 1312-1316. Althoughthe State's approach has proven sound as a matter of tactics,
allowing it to prevail in a forum that is not as inhibited byprecedent as are other federal courts, the Court's decision
undermines the authority and equitable powers of not onlythis District Court, but District Courts throughout the Nation. It is quite wrong, in my judgment, for this Court tosuggest that the District Court denied the State a fair opportunity to be heard, and entirely unnecessary for it to disposeof the smorgasbord of constitutional issues that it consumes
in Part II.Accordingly, while I agree that a remand is appropriate,
I cannot join the Court's opinion.

GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 95-719. Argued April 16, 1996--Decided June 24, 1996
Under the law of New York, appellate courts are empowered to review

the size of jury verdicts and to order new trials when the jury's award
"deviates materially from what would be reasonable compensation."
N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law and Rules (CPLR) $ 5501(c). Under the Seventh
Amendment, which governs proceedings in federal court, but not in
state court, "the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact
tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the
United States, than according to the rules of the common law." The
compatibility of these provisions, in an action based on New York law
but tried in federal court by reason of the parties' diverse citizenship,
is the issue the Court confronts in this case.

Petitioner Gasperini, a journalist and occasional photographer, loaned
300 original slide transparencies to respondent Center for Humanities,
Inc. When the Center lost the transparencies, Gasperini commenced
suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York, invoking the court's diversity jurisdiction. The Center
conceded liability. After a trial on damages, a jury awarded Gasperini
$1,500 per transparency, the asserted "industry standard" of compensation for a lost transparency. Contending, inter alia, that the verdict
was excessive, the Center moved for a new trial. The District Court,
without comment, denied the motion.

The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, observing that New
York law governed the controversy, endeavored to apply CPLR $ 5501(c)
to evaluate the Center's contention that the verdict was excessive.
Guided by New York Appellate Division decisions reviewing damage
awards for lost transparencies, the Second Circuit held that the $450,000
verdict "materially deviates from what is reasonable compensation."
The court vacated the judgment entered on the jury verdict and ordered
a new trial, unless Gasperini agreed to an award of $100,000.

Held: New York's law controlling compensation awards for excessiveness

or inadequacy can be given effect, without detriment to the Seventh
Amendment, if the review standard set out in CPLR $ 5501(c) is applied
by the federal trial court judge, with appellate control of the trial court's
ruling confined to "abuse of discretion." Pp. 422-439.

416 GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.

Syllabus
(a) To heighten the judicial check on the size of jury awards, New
York codified the "deviates materially" standard of review, replacing the
judge-made "shock the conscience" formulation previously used in New
York courts. In design and operation, $ 5501(c) influences outcomes by
tightening the range of tolerable awards. Although phrased as a direction to New York's intermediate appellate courts, $ 5501(c)'s "deviates
materially" standard, as construed by New York's courts, instructs state
trial judges as well. Pp. 422-425.

(b) In cases like Gasperini's, in which New York law governs the
claims for relief, the Court must determine whether New York law also
supplies the test for federal-court review of the size of the verdict.
Federal diversity jurisdiction provides an alternative forum for the adjudication of state-created rights, but it does not carry with it generation of rules of substantive law. Under the doctrine of Erie R. Co. v.
Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, federal courts sitting in diversity apply state
substantive law and federal procedural law. Classification of a law as
"substantive" or "procedural" for Erie purposes is sometimes a challenging endeavor. Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99, an early
interpretation of Erie, propounded an "outcome-determination" test:
"[D]oes it significantly affect the result of a litigation for a federal court
to disregard a law of a State that would be controlling in an action upon
the same claim by the same parties in a State court?" 326 U. S., at 109.
A later pathmarking case, qualifying Guaranty Trust, explained that
the "outcome-determination" test must not be applied mechanically to
sweep in all manner of variations; instead, its application must be guided
by "the twin aims of the Erie rule: discouragement of forum-shopping
and avoidance of inequitable administration of the laws." Hanna v.
Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, 468.

Informed by these decisions, the Court concludes that, although

$ 5501(c) contains a procedural instruction assigning decisionmaking
authority to the New York Appellate Division, the State's objective is
manifestly substantive. More rigorous comparative evaluations attend
application of $ 5501(c)'s "deviates materially" standard than the
common-law "shock the conscience" test. If federal courts ignore the
change in the New York standard and persist in applying the "shock the
conscience" test to damage awards on claims governed by New York
law, " `substantial' variations between state and federal [money judgments]" may be expected. See id., at 467-468. The Court therefore
agrees with the Second Circuit that New York's check on excessive damages warrants application in federal court, for Erie's doctrine precludes
a recovery in federal court significantly larger than the recovery that
would have been tolerated in state court. Pp. 426-431.

Syllabus
(c) Nonetheless, when the Second Circuit used $ 5501(c) as the standard for federal appellate review, it did not attend to "[a]n essential characteristic of [the federal court] system." Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural
Elec. Cooperative, Inc., 356 U. S. 525, 537. The Seventh Amendment,
which governs proceedings in federal court, but not in state court, bears
not only on the allocation of trial functions between judge and jury, the
issue in Byrd; it also controls the allocation of authority to review verdicts, the issue of concern here. In keeping with the historic understanding, the Seventh Amendment's Reexamination Clause does not inhibit the authority of trial judges to grant new trials "for any of the
reasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted in actions at
law in the courts of the United States." Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 59(a). In
contrast, appellate review of a federal trial court's denial of a motion to
set aside a jury's verdict as excessive is a relatively late, and less secure,
development. Such review, once deemed inconsonant with the Seventh
Amendment's Reexamination Clause, has not been expressly approved
by this Court before today. See, e. g., Browning-Ferris Industries of
Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 279, n. 25. Circuit decisions unanimously recognize, however, that appellate review, confined
to abuse of discretion, is reconcilable with the Seventh Amendment as
a control necessary and proper to the fair administration of justice. The
Court now approves this line of decisions. Pp. 431-436.

(d) In this case, the principal state and federal interests can be accommodated. New York's dominant interest in having its substantive law
guide the allowable damages arising out of a state-law claim for relief
can be respected, without disrupting the federal system, once it is recognized that the federal district court is capable of applying the State's
"deviates materially" standard. The Court recalls, in this regard, that
the "deviates materially" standard serves as the guide to be applied in
trial as well as appellate courts in New York. Within the federal system, practical reasons combine with Seventh Amendment constraints to
lodge in the district court, not the court of appeals, primary responsibility for application of $ 5501(c)'s check. District court applications of the
"deviates materially" standard would be subject to appellate review
under the standard the Circuits now employ when inadequacy or excessiveness is asserted on appeal: abuse of discretion. Pp. 436-439.

(e) It does not appear that the District Court checked the jury's verdict against the relevant New York decisions. Accordingly, the Court
vacates the judgment of the Court of Appeals and instructs that court
to remand the case to the District Court so that the trial judge, revisiting his ruling on the new trial motion, may test the jury's verdict
against CPLR $ 5501(c)'s "deviates materially" standard. P. 439.

parties' diverse citizenship, is the issue we confront in thiscase. We hold that New York's law controlling compensation awards for excessiveness or inadequacy can be giveneffect, without detriment to the Seventh Amendment, if the
review standard set out in CPLR $ 5501(c) is applied by the
federal trial court judge, with appellate control of the trialcourt's ruling limited to review for "abuse of discretion."

I
Petitioner William Gasperini, a journalist for CBS Newsand the Christian Science Monitor, began reporting on

events in Central America in 1984. He earned his livingprimarily in radio and print media and only occasionally sold
his photographic work. During the course of his seven-yearstint in Central America, Gasperini took over 5,000 slide
transparencies, depicting active war zones, political leaders,
and scenes from daily life. In 1990, Gasperini agreed tosupply his original color transparencies to The Center for

Humanities, Inc. (Center) for use in an educational videotape,Conflict in Central America. Gasperini selected 300 of his
slides for the Center; its videotape included 110 of them.The Center agreed to return the original transparencies, but
upon the completion of the project, it could not find them.Gasperini commenced suit in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York, invoking the
court's diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1332.1He alleged several state-law claims for relief, including

breach of contract, conversion, and negligence. See App.
5-6. The Center conceded liability for the lost transparen-cies and the issue of damages was tried before a jury.

1 Plaintiff Gasperini, petitioner here, is a citizen of California; defendant
Center, respondent here, is incorporated, and has its principal place of
business, in New York.

420 GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.

Opinion of the Court
At trial, Gasperini's expert witness testified that the "in-dustry standard" within the photographic publishing community valued a lost transparency at $1,500. See id., at 227.This industry standard, the expert explained, represented
the average license fee a commercial photograph could earn
over the full course of the photographer's copyright, i. e., inGasperini's case, his lifetime plus 50 years. See

id., at 228;
see also 17 U. S. C. $ 302(a). Gasperini estimated that hisearnings from photography totaled just over $10,000 for the

period from 1984 through 1993. He also testified that heintended to produce a book containing his best photographs
from Central America. See App. 175.

After a three-day trial, the jury awarded Gasperini
$450,000 in compensatory damages. This sum, the jury foreperson announced, "is [$]1500 each, for 300 slides." Id., at
313. Moving for a new trial under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 59, the Center attacked the verdict on various
grounds, including excessiveness. Without comment, the
District Court denied the motion. See App. to Pet. for
Cert. 12a.

The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the
judgment entered on the jury's verdict. 66 F. 3d 427 (1995).
Mindful that New York law governed the controversy, the
Court of Appeals endeavored to apply CPLR $ 5501(c), which
instructs that, when a jury returns an itemized verdict, as
the jury did in this case, the New York Appellate Division
"shall determine that an award is excessive or inadequate if
it deviates materially from what would be reasonable compensation." The Second Circuit's application of $ 5501(c) as
a check on the size of the jury's verdict followed Circuit precedent elaborated two weeks earlier in Consorti v. Armstrong

World Industries, Inc., 64 F. 3d 781, superseded, 72 F. 3d
1003 (1995). Surveying Appellate Division decisions that
reviewed damage awards for lost transparencies, the Second
Circuit concluded that testimony on industry standard alone
was insufficient to justify a verdict; prime among other fac518us2$82P 05-18-99 18:37:58 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
tors warranting consideration were the uniqueness of the
slides' subject matter and the photographer's earning level.2

Guided by Appellate Division rulings, the Second Circuit
held that the $450,000 verdict "materially deviates from
what is reasonable compensation." 66 F. 3d, at 431. Some
of Gasperini's transparencies, the Second Circuit recognized,
were unique, notably those capturing combat situations in
which Gasperini was the only photographer present. Id., at
429. But others "depicted either generic scenes or events
at which other professional photojournalists were present."
Id., at 431. No more than 50 slides merited a $1,500 award,
the court concluded, after "[g]iving Gasperini every benefit
of the doubt." Ibid. Absent evidence showing significant
earnings from photographic endeavors or concrete plans to
publish a book, the court further determined, any damage
award above $100 each for the remaining slides would be
excessive. Remittiturs "presen[t] difficult problems for appellate courts," the Second Circuit acknowledged, for court
of appeals judges review the evidence from "a cold paper
record." Ibid. Nevertheless, the Second Circuit set aside
the $450,000 verdict and ordered a new trial, unless Gasperini agreed to an award of $100,000.

422 GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.

Opinion of the Court
This case presents an important question regarding thestandard a federal court uses to measure the alleged excessiveness of a jury's verdict in an action for damages basedon state law. We therefore granted certiorari. 516 U. S.
1086 (1996). II

Before 1986, state and federal courts in New York gener-ally invoked the same judge-made formulation in responding
to excessiveness attacks on jury verdicts: courts would notdisturb an award unless the amount was so exorbitant that
it "shocked the conscience of the court." See Consorti, 72F. 3d, at 1012-1013 (collecting cases). As described by the
Second Circuit:

"The standard for determining excessiveness and theappropriateness of remittitur in New York is somewhat

ambiguous. Prior to 1986, New York law employed thesame standard as the federal courts,

see Matthews v.CTI Container Transport Int'l Inc., 871 F. 2d 270, 278

(2d Cir. 1989), which authorized remittitur only if thejury's verdict was so excessive that it `shocked the conscience of the court.' " Id., at 1012.
See also D. Siegel, Practice Commentaries C5501:10, re-printed in 7B McKinney's Consolidated Laws of New York

Ann., p. 25 (1995) ("conventional standard for altering theverdict was that its sum was so great or so small that it
`shocked the conscience' of the court").In both state and federal courts, trial judges made the
excessiveness assessment in the first instance, and appellatejudges ordinarily deferred to the trial court's judgment.
See, e. g., McAllister v. Adam Packing Corp., 66 App. Div.2d 975, 976, 412 N. Y. S. 2d 50, 52 (3d Dept. 1978) ("The trial
court's determination as to the adequacy of the jury verdictwill only be disturbed by an appellate court where it can
be said that the trial court's exercise of discretion was notreasonably grounded."); Martell v. Boardwalk Enterprises,

Inc., 748 F. 2d 740, 750 (CA2 1984) ("The trial court's refusalto set aside or reduce a jury award will be overturned only

for abuse of discretion.").In 1986, as part of a series of tort reform measures,

3

New York codified a standard for judicial review of the sizeof jury awards. Placed in CPLR $ 5501(c), the prescription

reads:

"In reviewing a money judgment . . . in which it is con-tended that the award is excessive or inadequate and

that a new trial should have been granted unless a stipu-lation is entered to a different award, the appellate division shall determine that an award is excessive or in-adequate if it deviates materially from what would be
reasonable compensation." 4
As stated in Legislative Findings and Declarations accom-panying New York's adoption of the "deviates materially"

formulation, the lawmakers found the "shock the conscience"test an insufficient check on damage awards; the legislature
therefore installed a standard "invit[ing] more careful appel-late scrutiny." Ch. 266, 1986 N. Y. Laws 470 (McKinney).
At the same time, the legislature instructed the AppellateDivision, in amended $ 5522, to state the reasons for the
court's rulings on the size of verdicts, and the factors the

4 In full, CPLR $ 5501(c) provides:

"The appellate division shall review questions of law and questions of
fact on an appeal from a judgment or order of a court of original instance
and on an appeal from an order of the supreme court, a county court or
an appellate term determining an appeal. In reviewing a money judgment in an action in which an itemized verdict is required by rule fortyone hundred eleven of this chapter in which it is contended that the award
is excessive or inadequate and that a new trial should have been granted
unless a stipulation is entered to a different award, the appellate division
shall determine that an award is excessive or inadequate if it deviates
materially from what would be reasonable compensation."

court considered in complying with $ 5501(c).5 In his signingstatement, then-Governor Mario Cuomo emphasized that the

CPLR amendments were meant to rachet up the reviewstandard: "This will assure greater scrutiny of the amount
of verdicts and promote greater stability in the tort sys-tem and greater fairness for similarly situated defendants
throughout the State." Memorandum on Approving L.1986, Ch. 682, 1986 N. Y. Laws, at 3184; see also Newman &
Ahmuty, Appellate Review of Punitive Damage Awards, inInsurance, Excess, and Reinsurance Coverage Disputes 1990,
p. 409 (B. Ostrager & T. Newman eds. 1990) (review standard
prescribed in $ 5501(c) "was intended to . . . encourage Appellate Division modification of excessive awards").New York state-court opinions confirm that $ 5501(c)'s "deviates materially" standard calls for closer surveillance than"shock the conscience" oversight. See,

e. g., O'Connor v.
Graziosi, 131 App. Div. 2d 553, 554, 516 N. Y. S. 2d 276, 277(2d Dept. 1987) ("apparent intent" of 1986 legislation was "to

facilitate appellate changes in verdicts"); Harvey v. Mazal
American Partners, 79 N. Y. 2d 218, 225, 590 N. E. 2d 224,
228 (1992) (instructing Appellate Division to use, in setting
remittitur, only the "deviates materially" standard, and notthe "shock the conscience" test); see also

Consorti, 72 F. 3d,
at 1013 ("Material deviation from reasonableness is less thanthat deviation required to find an award so excessive as to

`shock the conscience.' "); 7 J. Weinstein, H. Korn, & A.Miller, New York Civil Practice || 5501.21, p. 55-64 (1995)
("Under [$ 5501(c)'s] new standard, the reviewing court isgiven greater power to review the size of a jury award than
had heretofore been afforded . . . .").

5 CPLR $ 5522(b) provides:
"In an appeal from a money judgment in an action . . . in which it is
contended that the award is excessive or inadequate, the appellate division
shall set forth in its decision the reasons therefor, including the factors it
considered in complying with subdivision (c) of section fifty-five hundred

Opinion of the Court
Although phrased as a direction to New York's intermediate appellate courts, $ 5501(c)'s "deviates materially" standard, as construed by New York's courts, instructs state trial
judges as well. See, e. g., Inya v. Ide Hyundai, Inc., 209
App. Div. 2d 1015, 619 N. Y. S. 2d 440 (4th Dept. 1994) (error
for trial court to apply "shock the conscience" test to motion
to set aside damages; proper standard is whether award
"materially deviates from what would be reasonable compensation"); Cochetti v. Gralow, 192 App. Div. 2d 974, 975, 597
N. Y. S. 2d 234, 235 (3d Dept. 1993) ("settled law" that trial
courts conduct "materially deviates" inquiry); Shurgan v.
Tedesco, 179 App. Div. 2d 805, 806, 578 N. Y. S. 2d 658, 659 (2d
Dept. 1992) (approving trial court's application of "materially
deviates" standard); see also Lightfoot v. Union Carbide
Corp., 901 F. Supp. 166, 169 (SDNY 1995) (CPLR 5501(c)'s
"materially deviates" standard "is pretty well established as
applicable to [state] trial and appellate courts."). Application of $ 5501(c) at the trial level is key to this case.

To determine whether an award "deviates materially from
what would be reasonable compensation," New York state
courts look to awards approved in similar cases. See, e. g.,
Leon v. J & M Peppe Realty Corp., 190 App. Div. 2d 400,
416, 596 N. Y. S. 2d 380, 389 (1st Dept. 1993) ("These awards
. . . are not out of line with recent awards sustained by appellate courts."); Johnston v. Joyce, 192 App. Div. 2d 1124, 1125,
596 N. Y. S. 2d 625, 626 (4th Dept. 1993) (reducing award to
maximum amount previously allowed for similar type of
harm). Under New York's former "shock the conscience"
test, courts also referred to analogous cases. See, e. g.,
Senko v. Fonda, 53 App. Div. 2d 638, 639, 384 N. Y. S. 2d
849, 851 (2d Dept. 1976). The "deviates materially" standard, however, in design and operation, influences outcomes
by tightening the range of tolerable awards. See, e. g.,
Consorti, 72 F. 3d, at 1013, and n. 10, 1014-1015, and
n. 14.

426 GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.

Opinion of the Court

III
In cases like Gasperini's, in which New York law governsthe claims for relief, does New York law also supply the test

for federal-court review of the size of the verdict? The Cen-ter answers yes. The "deviates materially" standard, it argues, is a substantive standard that must be applied by fed-eral appellate courts in diversity cases. The Second Circuit
agreed. See 66 F. 3d, at 430; see also Consorti, 72 F. 3d,at 1011 ("[CPLR $ 5501(c)] is the substantive rule provided
by New York law."). Gasperini, emphasizing that $ 5501(c)trains on the New York Appellate Division, characterizes the
provision as procedural, an allocation of decisionmaking au-thority regarding damages, not a hard cap on the amount
recoverable. Correctly comprehended, Gasperini urges,$ 5501(c)'s direction to the Appellate Division cannot be given
effect by federal appellate courts without violating the Sev-enth Amendment's Reexamination Clause.

As the parties' arguments suggest, CPLR $ 5501(c), ap-praised under

Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938),and decisions in Erie's path, is both "substantive" and "procedural": "substantive" in that $ 5501(c)'s "deviates materi-ally" standard controls how much a plaintiff can be awarded;
"procedural" in that $ 5501(c) assigns decisionmaking author-ity to New York's Appellate Division. Parallel application
of $ 5501(c) at the federal appellate level would be out of syncwith the federal system's division of trial and appellate court
functions, an allocation weighted by the Seventh Amend-ment. The dispositive question, therefore, is whether federal courts can give effect to the substantive thrust of$ 5501(c) without untoward alteration of the federal scheme
for the trial and decision of civil cases.

A
Federal diversity jurisdiction provides an alternativeforum for the adjudication of state-created rights, but it does

not carry with it generation of rules of substantive law. As

Opinion of the Court
Erie read the Rules of Decision Act: 6 "Except in mattersgoverned by the Federal Constitution or by Acts of Congress, the law to be applied in any case is the law of theState." 304 U. S., at 78. Under the Erie doctrine, federal
courts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law andfederal procedural law.

Classification of a law as "substantive" or "procedural"for

Erie purposes is sometimes a challenging endeavor.7G uaranty Tr ust Co. v. York, 326 U. S. 99 (1945), an

early interpretation of Erie, propounded an "outcome-determination" test: "[D]oes it significantly affect the result
of a litigation for a federal court to disregard a law of a Statethat would be controlling in an action upon the same claim
by the same parties in a State court?" 326 U. S., at 109.Ordering application of a state statute of limitations to an
equity proceeding in federal court, the Court said in Guar6 Originally $ 34 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the Rules of Decision Act,
now contained in 28 U. S. C. $ 1652, reads: "The laws of the several states,
except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or Acts of
Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the United States, in cases where
they apply."

7 Concerning matters covered by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,

the characterization question is usually unproblematic: It is settled that if
the Rule in point is consonant with the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U. S. C.

$ 2072, and the Constitution, the Federal Rule applies regardless of contrary state law. See Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, 469-474 (1965); Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 4-5 (1987). Federal courts
have interpreted the Federal Rules, however, with sensitivity to important state interests and regulatory policies. See, e. g., Walker v. Armco
Steel Corp., 446 U. S. 740, 750-752 (1980) (reaffirming decision in Ragan v.
Merchants Transfer & Warehouse Co., 337 U. S. 530 (1949), that state law
rather than Rule 3 determines when a diversity action commences for the
purposes of tolling the state statute of limitations; Rule 3 makes no reference to the tolling of state limitations, the Court observed, and accordingly
found no "direct conflict"); S. A. Healy Co. v. Milwaukee Metropolitan
Sewerage Dist., 60 F. 3d 305, 310-312 (CA7 1995) (state provision for offers
of settlement by plaintiffs is compatible with Federal Rule 68, which is
limited to offers by defendants).

428 GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.

Opinion of the Court
anty Trust: "[W]here a federal court is exercising jurisdiction solely because of the diversity of citizenship of the parties, the outcome of the litigation in the federal court should
be substantially the same, so far as legal rules determine the
outcome of a litigation, as it would be if tried in a State
court." Ibid.; see also Ragan v. Merchants Transfer &
Warehouse Co., 337 U. S. 530, 533 (1949) (when local law that
creates the cause of action qualifies it, "federal court must
follow suit," for "a different measure of the cause of action
in one court than in the other [would transgress] the principle of Erie"). A later pathmarking case, qualifying Guaranty Trust, explained that the "outcome-determination" test
must not be applied mechanically to sweep in all manner of
variations; instead, its application must be guided by "the
twin aims of the Erie rule: discouragement of forumshopping and avoidance of inequitable administration of the
laws." Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, 468 (1965).

Informed by these decisions, we address the question
whether New York's "deviates materially" standard, codified
in CPLR $ 5501(c), is outcome affective in this sense: Would
"application of the [standard] . . . have so important an effect
upon the fortunes of one or both of the litigants that failure
to [apply] it would [unfairly discriminate against citizens of
the forum State, or] be likely to cause a plaintiff to choose
the federal court"? Id., at 468, n. 9.8

We start from a point the parties do not debate. Gasperini acknowledges that a statutory cap on damages would supply substantive law for Erie purposes. See Reply Brief for

8 Hanna keyed the question to Erie's "twin aims"; in full, Hanna instructed federal courts to ask "whether application of the [State's] rule
would make so important a difference to the character or result of the
litigation that failure to enforce it would unfairly discriminate against citizens of the forum State, or whether application of the rule would have so
important an effect upon the fortunes of one or both of the litigants that
failure to enforce it would be likely to cause a plaintiff to choose the federal
court." 380 U. S., at 468, n. 9.

Petitioner 2 ("[T]he state as a matter of its substantive law
may, among other things, eliminate the availability of damages for a particular claim entirely, limit the factors a jury
may consider in determining damages, or place an absolute
cap on the amount of damages available, and such substantive law would be applicable in a federal court sitting in diversity."); see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 4-5, 25; Consorti, 72 F.
3d, at 1011.9 Although CPLR $ 5501(c) is less readily classified, it was designed to provide an analogous control.

New York's Legislature codified in $ 5501(c) a new standard, one that requires closer court review than the commonlaw "shock the conscience" test. See supra, at 422-423.
More rigorous comparative evaluations attend application
of $ 5501(c)'s "deviates materially" standard. See supra, at
423-425. To foster predictability, the legislature required
the reviewing court, when overturning a verdict under

$ 5501(c), to state its reasons, including the factors it considered relevant. See CPLR $ 5522(b); supra, at 423-424. We
think it a fair conclusion that CPLR $ 5501(c) differs from
a statutory cap principally "in that the maximum amount
recoverable is not set forth by statute, but rather is determined by case law." Brief for City of New York as Amicus
Curiae 11. In sum, $ 5501(c) contains a procedural instruction, see supra, at 426, but the State's objective is manifestly
substantive. Cf. S. A. Healy Co. v. Milwaukee Metropolitan
Sewerage Dist., 60 F. 3d 305, 310 (CA7 1995).

It thus appears that if federal courts ignore the change in
the New York standard and persist in applying the "shock

have held that district court application of state statutory caps in diversity

the conscience" test to damage awards on claims governedby New York law,

10 " `substantial' variations between state

and federal [money judgments]" may be expected. SeeHanna, 380 U. S., at 467-468.

11 We therefore agree with the

Second Circuit that New York's check on excessive damagesimplicates what we have called

Erie's "twin aims." Seesupra, at 428.
12 Just as the Erie principle precludes a federal court from giving a state-created claim "longer life . . .than [the claim] would have had in the state court," Ragan,

10 Justice Scalia questions whether federal district courts in New
York "actually appl[y]" or "ought" to apply the "shock the conscience" test
in assessing a jury's award for excessiveness. Post, at 465-466 (collecting
various formulations of review standard). If there is a federal district
court standard, it must come from the Court of Appeals, not from the over
40 district court judges in the Southern District of New York, each of
whom sits alone and renders decisions not binding on the others. Indeed,
in Ismail v. Cohen, 899 F. 2d 183 (1990), the authority upon which Justice
Scalia relies, the Second Circuit stated that district courts test damage
awards for excessiveness under the "shock the conscience" standard. See
id., at 186 ("A remittitur, in effect, is a statement by the court that it is
shocked by the jury's award of damages."); see also Scala v. Moore McCormack Lines, Inc., 985 F. 2d 680, 683 (CA2 1993) ("[I]n the federal courts,
a judgment cannot stand where the damages awarded are so excessive as
to shock the judicial conscience.") (internal quotation marks and citation
omitted).

11 Justice Scalia questions whether application of CPLR $ 5501(c), in

lieu of the standard generally used by federal courts within the Second
Circuit, see supra, at 422, will in fact yield consistent outcome differentials, see post, at 465, 466. The numbers, as the Second Circuit believed,
are revealing. See 66 F. 3d 427, 430 (1995). Is the difference between
an award of $450,000 and $100,000, see supra, at 421, or between $1,500
per transparency and $500, see supra, at 421, n. 2, fairly described as
insubstantial? We do not see how that can be so.

12 For rights that are state created, state law governs the amount properly awarded as punitive damages, subject to an ultimate federal constitutional check for exorbitancy. See BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore,
517 U. S. 559, 568 (1996); Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco
Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 278-279 (1989). An evenhanded approach
would require federal-court deference to endeavors like New York's to
control compensatory damages for excessiveness. See infra, at 435, n. 18.

337 U. S., at 533-534, so Erie precludes a recovery in federalcourt significantly larger than the recovery that would have

been tolerated in state court.

B
CPLR $ 5501(c), as earlier noted, see supra, at 425, 426, isphrased as a direction to the New York Appellate Division.

Acting essentially as a surrogate for a New York appellateforum, the Court of Appeals reviewed Gasperini's award to
determine if it "deviate[d] materially" from damage awardsthe Appellate Division permitted in similar circumstances.
The Court of Appeals performed this task without benefit ofan opinion from the District Court, which had denied "without comment" the Center's Rule 59 motion. 66 F. 3d, at 428.Concentrating on the authority $ 5501(c) gives to the Appellate Division, Gasperini urges that the provision shifts fact-finding responsibility from the jury and the trial judge to the
appellate court. Assigning such responsibility to an appel-late court, he maintains, is incompatible with the Seventh
Amendment's Reexamination Clause, and therefore, Gasper-ini concludes, $ 5501(c) cannot be given effect in federal court.
Brief for Petitioner 19-20. Although we reach a differentconclusion than Gasperini, we agree that the Second Circuit
did not attend to "[a]n essential characteristic of [the federalcourt] system," Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative,
Inc., 356 U. S. 525, 537 (1958), when it used $ 5501(c) as "thestandard for [federal] appellate review," Consorti, 72 F. 3d,
at 1013; see also 66 F. 3d, at 430.That "essential characteristic" was described in

Byrd, adiversity suit for negligence in which a pivotal issue of fact

would have been tried by a judge were the case in statecourt. The Byrd Court held that, despite the state practice,13 the plaintiff was entitled to a jury trial in federal court.

13 The defendant argued in Byrd that although the personal injury plaintiff was employed by an independent contractor, the work plaintiff was
engaged to perform was the same as work done by defendant's own em518us2$82P 05-18-99 18:37:58 PAGES OPINPGT
432 GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.

Opinion of the Court
In so ruling, the Court said that the Guaranty Trust
"outcome-determination" test was an insufficient guide in
cases presenting countervailing federal interests. See
Byrd, 356 U. S., at 537. The Court described the countervailing federal interests present in Byrd this way:

"The federal system is an independent system for administering justice to litigants who properly invoke its
jurisdiction. An essential characteristic of that system
is the manner in which, in civil common-law actions, it
distributes trial functions between judge and jury and,
under the influence--if not the command--of the Seventh Amendment, assigns the decisions of disputed
questions of fact to the jury." Ibid. (footnote omitted).

The Seventh Amendment, which governs proceedings in
federal court, but not in state court,14 bears not only on the
allocation of trial functions between judge and jury, the issue
in Byrd; it also controls the allocation of authority to review
verdicts, the issue of concern here. The Amendment reads:

"In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy
shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury
shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be
otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United
States, than according to the rules of the common law."
U. S. Const., Amdt. 7.

Byrd involved the first Clause of the Amendment, the
"trial by jury" Clause. This case involves the second, the
"re-examination" Clause. In keeping with the historic unployees. Therefore, defendant maintained, the plaintiff ranked as a "statutory employee" whose sole remedy was under the State's workers' compensation law. The sameness of the work plaintiff and defendant's own
employees performed presented a fact question, but in state court, a jury
trial would not have been available to resolve it.

we have reaffirmed, "has . . . discretion to grant a new trialif the verdict appears to [the judge] to be against the weight

of the evidence." Byrd, 356 U. S., at 540. This discretionincludes overturning verdicts for excessiveness and ordering
a new trial without qualification, or conditioned on the ver-dict winner's refusal to agree to a reduction (remittitur).

Opinion of the Court
In contrast, appellate review of a federal trial court's de-nial of a motion to set aside a jury's verdict as excessive is a

relatively late, and less secure, development. Such reviewwas once deemed inconsonant with the Seventh Amendment's Reexamination Clause. See, e. g., Lincoln v. Power,151 U. S. 436, 437-438 (1894);

Williamson v. Osenton, 220 F.653, 655 (CA4 1915); see also 6A Moore's Federal Practice

|| 59.08[6], at 59-167 (collecting cases). We subsequentlyrecognized that, even in cases in which the Erie doctrine
was not in play--cases arising wholly under federal law--the question was not settled; we twice granted certiorari to
decide the unsettled issue, but ultimately resolved the caseson other grounds. See

Grunenthal v. Long Island R. Co.,393 U. S. 156, 158 (1968); Neese v. Southern R. Co., 350 U. S.

77 (1955).17Before today, we have not "expressly [held] that the Seventh Amendment allows appellate review of a district court'sdenial of a motion to set aside an award as excessive."
Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal,Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 279, n. 25 (1989). But in successive reminders that the question was worthy of this Court's atten-tion, we noted, without disapproval, that courts of appeals
engage in review of district court excessiveness determinaing the "incongruous position" that "a federal trial court may deny a motion for a new trial where the plaintiff consents to decrease the judgment
to a proper amount," but may not condition denial of the motion on "the
defendant's consent to a comparable increase in the recovery." Dimick v.
Schiedt, 293 U. S., at 495.

17 Dissenting from the Court's professed refusal to answer the question

presented in Grunenthal v. Long Island R. Co., Justices Harlan and Stewart observed that in Grunenthal itself, this Court indeed had reviewed
the refusal of the District Court to set aside a jury verdict for excessiveness. 393 U. S., at 163 (Harlan, J., dissenting); id., at 164-165 (Stewart,
J., dissenting). Justice Harlan commented: "Like my Brother Stewart,
I am at an utter loss to understand how the Court manages to review the
District Court's decision and find it proper while at the same time proclaiming that it has avoided decision of the issue whether appellate courts
ever may review such actions." Id., at 163.

tions, applying "abuse of discretion" as their standard. See
Grunenthal, 393 U. S., at 159. We noted the Circuit decisions in point, id., at 157, n. 3, and, in Browning-Ferris, we
again referred to appellate court abuse-of-discretion review:

"[T]he role of the district court is to determine whether
the jury's verdict is within the confines set by state law,
and to determine, by reference to federal standards developed under Rule 59, whether a new trial or remittitur
should be ordered. The court of appeals should then
review the district court's determination under an
abuse-of-discretion standard." 492 U. S., at 279.18

As the Second Circuit explained, appellate review for
abuse of discretion is reconcilable with the Seventh Amendment as a control necessary and proper to the fair administration of justice: "We must give the benefit of every doubt
to the judgment of the trial judge; but surely there must be
an upper limit, and whether that has been surpassed is not
a question of fact with respect to which reasonable men may
differ, but a question of law." Dagnello v. Long Island R.
Co., 289 F. 2d 797, 806 (CA2 1961) (quoted in Grunenthal, 393
U. S., at 159). All other Circuits agree. See, e. g., Holmes
v. Elgin, Joliet & Eastern R. Co., 18 F. 3d 1393, 1396 (CA7
1994); 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2820, p. 209 (2d ed. 1995) ("[E]very circuit has said that there are circumstances in which it can
reverse the denial of a new trial if the size of the verdict
seems to be too far out of line."); 6A Moore's Federal Practice

18 Browning-Ferris concerned punitive damages. We agree with the
Second Circuit, however, that "[f]or purposes of deciding whether state or
federal law is applicable, the question whether an award of compensatory
damages exceeds what is permitted by law is not materially different from
the question whether an award of punitive damages exceeds what is permitted by law." Consorti v. Armstrong World Industries, Inc., 72 F. 3d

C

In Byrd, the Court faced a one-or-the-other choice: trialby judge as in state court, or trial by jury according to the

federal practice.21 In the case before us, a choice of that

19 Justice Scalia disagrees. Ready to "destroy the uniformity of federal practice" in this regard, cf. post, at 467, he would render a judgment
described as "astonishing" by the very authority upon which he relies.
Compare post, at 460, with 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal
Practice and Procedure $ 2820, p. 212 (2d ed. 1995) ("it would be astonishing if the Court, which has passed up three opportunities to do so, should
ultimately reject" the unanimously held view of the courts of appeals).

20 If the meaning of the Seventh Amendment were fixed at 1791, our

civil juries would remain, as they unquestionably were at common law,
"twelve good men and true," 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *349; see
Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, 174 U. S. 1, 13 (1899) (" `Trial by jury,' in the
primary and usual sense of the term at the common law and in the American constitutions . . . is a trial by a jury of twelve men."). But see Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U. S. 149, 160 (1973) (six-member jury for civil trials
satisfies Seventh Amendment's guarantee). Procedures we have regarded as compatible with the Seventh Amendment, although not in conformity with practice at common law when the Amendment was adopted,
include new trials restricted to the determination of damages, Gasoline
Products Co. v. Champlin Refining Co., 283 U. S. 494 (1931), and Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b)'s motion for judgment as a matter of law,
see 9A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2522,
pp. 244-246 (2d ed. 1995). See also Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439
U. S. 322, 335-337 (1979) (issue preclusion absent mutuality of parties does
not violate Seventh Amendment, although common law as it existed in
1791 permitted issue preclusion only when there was mutuality).

21 The two-trial rule posited by Justice Scalia, post, at 467, surely

would be incompatible with the existence of "[t]he federal system [as] an
independent system for administering justice," Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural

order is not required, for the principal state and federal in-terests can be accommodated. The Second Circuit correctly

recognized that when New York substantive law governs aclaim for relief, New York law and decisions guide the allowable damages. See 66 F. 3d, at 430; see also Consorti, 72 F.3d, at 1011. But that court did not take into account the
characteristic of the federal court system that caused us toreaffirm: "The proper role of the trial and appellate courts
in the federal system in reviewing the size of jury verdictsis . . . a matter of federal law."

Donovan v. Penn ShippingCo., 429 U. S. 648, 649 (1977) (per curiam); see also

Browning-Ferris, 492 U. S., at 279 ("[T]he role of the districtcourt is to determine whether the jury's verdict is within the
confines set by state law . . . . The court of appeals shouldthen review the district court's determination under an
abuse-of-discretion standard.").New York's dominant interest can be respected, without
disrupting the federal system, once it is recognized that thefederal district court is capable of performing the checking
function, i. e., that court can apply the State's "deviates ma-terially" standard in line with New York case law evolving
under CPLR $ 5501(c).22 We recall, in this regard, that the
Elec. Cooperative, Inc., 356 U. S. 525, 537 (1958). We discern no disagreement on such examples among the many federal judges who have considered this case.

22 Justice Scalia finds in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59 a "federal

standard" for new trial motions in " `direct collision' " with, and " `leaving
no room for the operation of,' " a state law like CPLR $ 5501(c). Post, at
468 (quoting Burlington Northern R. Co., 480 U. S., at 4-5). The relevant
prescription, Rule 59(a), has remained unchanged since the adoption of the
Federal Rules by this Court in 1937. 302 U. S. 783. Rule 59(a) is as
encompassing as it is uncontroversial. It is indeed "Hornbook" law that
a most usual ground for a Rule 59 motion is that "the damages are excessive." See C. Wright, Law of Federal Courts 676-677 (5th ed. 1994).
Whether damages are excessive for the claim-in-suit must be governed by
some law. And there is no candidate for that governance other than the
law that gives rise to the claim for relief--here, the law of New York.
See 28 U. S. C. $$ 2072(a) and (b) ("Supreme Court shall have the power to
prescribe general rules of . . . procedure"; "[s]uch rules shall not abridge,

Opinion of the Court
"deviates materially" standard serves as the guide to be
applied in trial as well as appellate courts in New York.
See supra, at 425.

Within the federal system, practical reasons combine with
Seventh Amendment constraints to lodge in the district
court, not the court of appeals, primary responsibility for
application of $ 5501(c)'s "deviates materially" check. Trial
judges have the "unique opportunity to consider the evidence
in the living courtroom context," Taylor v. Washington Terminal Co., 409 F. 2d 145, 148 (CADC 1969), while appellate
judges see only the "cold paper record," 66 F. 3d, at 431.

District court applications of the "deviates materially"
standard would be subject to appellate review under the
standard the Circuits now employ when inadequacy or excessiveness is asserted on appeal: abuse of discretion. See 11
Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2820, at
212-214, and n. 24 (collecting cases); see 6A Moore's Federal
Practice || 59.08[6], at 59-177 to 59-185 (same). In light of
Erie's doctrine, the federal appeals court must be guided by
the damage-control standard state law supplies,23 but as the

Second Circuit itself has said: "If we reverse, it must be because of an abuse of discretion. . . . The very nature of the
problem counsels restraint. . . . We must give the benefit of

enlarge or modify any substantive right"); Browning-Ferris, 492 U. S., at
279 ("standard of excessiveness" is a "matte[r] of state, and not federal,
common law"); see also R. Fallon, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart and
Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System 729-730 (4th ed.
1996) (observing that Court "has continued since [Hanna v. Plumer, 380
U. S. 460 (1965),] to interpret the federal rules to avoid conflict with important state regulatory policies," citing Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., 446
U. S. 740 (1980)).

23 If liability and damage-control rules are split apart here, as Justice

Scalia says they must be to save the Seventh Amendment, then Gasperini's claim and others like it would be governed by a most curious "law."
The sphinx-like, damage-determining law he would apply to this controversy has a state forepart, but a federal hindquarter. The beast may not
be brutish, but there is little judgment in its creation.

every doubt to the judgment of the trial judge." Dagnello,289 F. 2d, at 806.

IV
It does not appear that the District Court checked thejury's verdict against the relevant New York decisions demanding more than "industry standard" testimony to sup-port an award of the size the jury returned in this case. As
the Court of Appeals recognized, see 66 F. 3d, at 429, theuniqueness of the photographs and the plaintiff 's earnings
as photographer--past and reasonably projected--are fac-tors relevant to appraisal of the award. See, e. g., Blackman
v. Michael Friedman Publishing Group, Inc., 201 App. Div.2d 328, 607 N. Y. S. 2d 43, 44 (1st Dept. 1994); Nierenberg v.
Wursteria, Inc., 189 App. Div. 2d 571, 571-572, 592 N. Y. S.2d 27, 27-28 (1st Dept. 1993). Accordingly, we vacate the
judgment of the Court of Appeals and instruct that court toremand the case to the District Court so that the trial judge,
revisiting his ruling on the new trial motion, may test thejury's verdict against CPLR $ 5501(c)'s "deviates materially" standard.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
While I agree with most of the reasoning in the Court'sopinion, I disagree with its disposition of the case. I would

affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. I would alsoreject the suggestion that the Seventh Amendment limits
the power of a federal appellate court sitting in diversity todecide whether a jury's award of damages exceeds a limit
established by state law. I

The Court correctly explains why the 1986 enactment of$ 5501(c) of the N. Y. Civ. Prac. Law and Rules (McKinney
1995) changed the substantive law of the State. A state-lawceiling on allowable damages, whether fixed by a dollar limit
or by a standard that forbids any award that "deviates mate518us2$82I 05-18-99 18:37:58 PAGES OPINPGT

rially from what would be reasonable compensation," ibid.,is a substantive rule of decision that federal courts must

apply in diversity cases governed by New York law.I recognize that state rules of appellate procedure do not
necessarily bind federal appellate courts. The majority per-suasively shows, however, that New York has not merely
adopted a new procedure for allocating the decisionmakingfunction between trial and appellate courts.

Ante, at 422-425. Instead, New York courts have held that all jury

awards, not only those reviewed on appeal, must conformto the requirement that they not "deviat[e] materially" from
amounts awarded in like cases. Ante, at 425. That NewYork has chosen to tie its damages ceiling to awards traditionally recovered in similar cases, rather than to a legisla-tively determined but inflexible monetary sum, is none of
our concern.Given the nature of the state-law command, the Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit correctly concluded in Consorti v. Armstrong World Industries, Inc., 64 F. 3d 781, su-perseded, 72 F. 3d 1003 (1995), that New York's excessiveness standard applies in federal court in diversity casescontrolled by New York law.

Consorti erred in basing thatconclusion in part on the fact that a New York statute requires that State's appellate division to apply the standard,but it was nevertheless faithful to the Rules of Decision Act,
as construed in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938),in holding that a state-law limitation on the size of a judgment could not be ignored.1 Similarly, the Court of Appeals

1 Because there is no conceivable conflict between Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 59 and the application of the New York damages limit, this case
is controlled by Erie and the Rules of Decision Act, rather than by the
Rules Enabling Act's limitation on federal procedural rules that conflict
with state substantive rights. See Ely, The Irrepressible Myth of Erie,
87 Harv. L. Rev. 693, 698 (1974); see also Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312
U. S. 1 (1941). The Rule does state that new trials may be granted "for
any of the reasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted in
actions at law in the courts of the United States," but that hardly consti518us2$82I 05-18-99 18:37:58 PAGES OPINPGT

correctly followed Consorti in this case and consideredwhether the damages awarded materially deviated from

damages awarded in similar cases. 66 F. 3d 427, 431 (CA21995). I endorse both opinions in these respects.

Although the majority agrees with the Court of Appealsthat New York law establishes the size of the damages that
may be awarded, it chooses to vacate and remand. The ma-jority holds that a federal court of appeals should review for
abuse of discretion a district court's decision to deny a motionfor new trial based on a jury's excessive award. As a result,
it concludes that the District Court should be given the op-portunity to apply in the first instance the "deviates materially" standard that New York law imposes. Ante, at 439.The District Court had its opportunity to consider the propriety of the jury's award, and it erred. The Court of Ap-peals has now corrected that error after "drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of " petitioner. 66 F. 3d, at 431. Asthere is no reason to suppose that the Court of Appeals has
reached a conclusion with which the District Court couldpermissibly disagree on remand, I would not require the District Court to repeat a task that has already been well per-formed by the reviewing court. I therefore would affirm
the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

II
Although I have addressed the question presented as ifour decision in Erie alone controlled its outcome, petitioner

argues that the second clause of the Seventh Amendment,which states that "no fact tried by jury, shall be otherwise
re-examined in any Court of the United States, than accord-ing to the rules of the common law," U. S. Const., Amdt. 7,

tutes a command that federal courts must always substitute federal limits
on the size of judgments for those set by the several States in cases
founded upon state-law causes of action. Even at the time of the Rule's
adoption, federal courts were bound to apply state statutory law in such
cases.

442 GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.

Stevens, J., dissenting
bars the procedure followed by the Court of Appeals. Thereis no merit to that position.

Early cases do state that the Reexamination Clause pro-hibits appellate review of excessive jury awards, but they
do not foreclose the practice altogether. See, e. g., Southern
Railway-Carolina Div. v. Bennett, 233 U. S. 80, 87 (1914) ("Itmay be admitted that if it were true that the excess appeared as [a] matter of law; that if, for instance, the statutefixed a maximum and the verdict exceeded it, a question
might arise for this court"); 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, &M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2820, pp. 207-209
(2d ed. 1995). Indeed, for the last 30 years, we have consistently reserved the question whether the Constitution permits such review, ante, at 434-435, and, in the meantime,
every Court of Appeals has agreed that the Seventh Amendment establishes no bar. 11 Wright & Miller $ 2820, at 209.

Taking the question to be an open one, I start with certain
basic principles. It is well settled that jury verdicts are not
binding on either trial judges or appellate courts if they are
unauthorized by law. A verdict may be insupportable as a
matter of law either because of deficiencies in the evidence
or because an award of damages is larger than permitted by
law. If an award is excessive as a matter of law--in a diversity case if it is larger than applicable state law permits--a
trial judge has a duty to set it aside. A failure to do so is
an error of law that the court of appeals has a duty to correct
on appeal.

These principles are sufficiently well established that no
Seventh Amendment issue would arise if an appellate court
ordered a new trial because a jury award exceeded a monetary cap on allowable damages. That New York has chosen
to define its legal limit in less mathematical terms does not

than the reviewing court. Three times this Term we haveassigned appellate courts the task of independently reviewing similarly mixed questions of law and fact. See Ornelasv.

United States, 517 U. S. 690, 696-697 (1996); Markman v.
Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U. S. 370, 388-390 (1996);
Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 90, 112-116 (1995). Suchappellate review is proper because mixed questions require

courts to construe all record inferences in favor of the fact-finder's decision and then to determine whether, on the facts
as found below, the legal standard has been met. See Ornelas, 517 U. S., at 696-697 (quoting Pullman-Standard v.
Swint, 456 U. S. 273, 289, n. 19 (1982)). In following thatprocedure here, the Court of Appeals did not reexamine any

fact determined by a jury. 66 F. 3d, at 431. It merely identified that portion of the judgment that constitutes "unlawfulexcess." See

Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S. 474, 486 (1935).2Even if review by the Court of Appeals implicates the

Reexamination Clause, it was "according to the rules of the
common law." U. S. Const., Amdt. 7. At common law, the
trial judge sitting nisi prius recommended whether a judicial panel sitting en banc at Westminster should accept the
jury's award. The en banc court then ruled on the motion
for new trial and entered judgment. 11 Wright & Miller

$ 2819, at 203.

Petitioner correctly points out that under this procedure
motions for new trial based on excessiveness were not technically subject to appellate review. Riddell, New Trial at
the Common Law, 26 Yale L. J. 49, 57 (1916) ("It seems clear
that in criminal as in civil cases, the trial Judge had not the

federal standard to "determine whether the award exceeds what is lawful
to such degree that it may be set aside by order for new trial or remittitur." Post, at 464. In my view, if an award "exceeds what is lawful,"
ibid., legal error has occurred and may be corrected. Certainly Dimick
does not premise a court's power to overturn an award that exceeds lawful
limits on the degree of the excess.

power to grant a new trial, but that recourse must be had to`the Court above' ");

id., at 60. However, because the nisi
prius judge often did not serve on the en banc court, the"court above" was in essentially the same position as a modern court of appeals. It considered the legality of the jury's
award in light of the trial judge's opinion, but without anyfirsthand knowledge of what had transpired below. See

Blume, Review of Facts in Jury Cases--The Seventh Amend-ment, 20 J. Am. Jud. Soc. 130, 131 (1936).

Petitioner also contends that at common law the en banccourt could only grant a new trial if the trial judge so recommended. That contention is undermined by numerous casesin which the "court above" granted new trials without making any reference to the trial judge's view of the damages.See,

e. g., Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg, 512 U. S. 415, 422-425
(1994) (citing cases).4 Moreover, early English cases repeat-edly state that the power to order a new trial when the jury

returned an excessive award rested with "the Court," rather
than the judge below,5 and Blackstone identifies excessive

3 For that reason, Justice Scalia is wrong to contend that the court at
Westminster acted in no more of an appellate fashion when it entertained
motions for new trials in causes tried at bar than when it entertained
them in causes tried at nisi prius. Post, at 456. In the former cases,
the en banc court would entertain a motion for new trial after having
heard the evidence itself. In the latter, it would sometimes entertain the
motion only after having heard the report on the evidence of the nisi
prius judge.

4 Although Honda itself involved review of punitive damages awards,

we expressly noted that there was no basis for suggesting "that different
standards of judicial review were applied for punitive and compensatory
damages before the 20th century," 512 U. S., at 422, n. 2. Indeed, many
of the decisions we relied upon in Honda involved compensatory damages,
and there is some authority to suggest that judicial review of the former
has a more secure historical pedigree than does judicial review of the
latter.

5 See, e. g., Bright v. Eynon, 1 Burr. 390, 97 Eng. Rep. 365, 368 (K. B.

damages as an independent basis on which the "court above"
may grant a new trial but makes no mention of a requirement that the trial judge must so recommend. 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *387.

Even when read most favorably to petitioner, therefore, no
meaningful distinction exists between the common-law practice by which the "court above" considered a new trial motion in the first instance, and the practice challenged here,
by which an appellate court reviews a district court's ruling
on a new trial motion. See Riddell, 26 Yale L. J., at 57. As
Justice Stone explained, in a dissenting opinion joined by
Chief Justice Hughes, Justice Brandeis, and Justice Cardozo:

"[The Seventh Amendment], intended to endure for unnumbered generations, is concerned with substance and
not with form. There is nothing in its history or language to suggest that the Amendment had any purpose
but to preserve the essentials of the jury trial as it was
known to the common law before the adoption of the
Constitution. For that reason this Court has often refused to construe it as intended to perpetuate in changeless form the minutiae of trial practice as it existed in
the English courts in 1791. From the beginning, its
language has been regarded as but subservient to the
single purpose of the Amendment, to preserve the essentials of the jury trial in actions at law, serving to
distinguish them from suits in equity and admiralty, see
Parsons v. Bedford, 3 Pet. 433, 446, and to safeguard the
jury's function from any encroachment which the common law did not permit.

attainment of justice"); Wood v. Gunston, Sty. 466, 82 Eng. Rep. 867 (K. B.

tryal, but this must be a judicial, and not an arbitrary discretion, and it is
frequent in our books for the Court to take notice of miscarriages of juries,
and to grant new tryals upon them . . .").

"Thus interpreted, the Seventh Amendment guaran-tees that suitors in actions at law shall have the benefits

of trial of issues of fact by a jury, but it does not pre-scribe any particular procedure by which these benefits
shall be obtained, or forbid any which does not curtailthe function of the jury to decide questions of fact as it
did before the adoption of the Amendment. It does notrestrict the court's control of the jury's verdict, as it had
previously been exercised, and it does not confine thetrial judge, in determining what issues are for the jury
and what for the court, to the particular forms of trialpractice in vogue in 1791."

Dimick v. Schiedt, 293U. S., at 490-491.

Because the Framers of the Seventh Amendment evincedno interest in subscribing to every procedural nicety of the
notoriously complicated English system, see Henderson, TheBackground of the Seventh Amendment, 80 Harv. L. Rev.
289, 290 (1966), the common-law practice certainly does notdemonstrate that the Reexamination Clause prohibits federal appellate courts from ensuring compliance with state-law limits on jury awards.

Nor does early and intricate English history justify themore limited assertion that federal appellate courts must be
limited to a particular, highly deferential standard of exces-siveness review. Common-law courts were hesitant to disturb jury awards, but less so in cases in which "a reasonablycertain measure of damages is afforded." 1 D. Graham, Law
of New Trials in Cases Civil and Criminal 452 (2d ed. 1855);Washington, Damages in Contract at Common Law, 47 L. Q.

III
For the reasons set forth above, I agree with the majoritythat the Reexamination Clause does not bar federal appellate

courts from reviewing jury awards for excessiveness. I con-fess to some surprise, however, at its conclusion that " `the
influence--if not the command--of the Seventh Amend-ment,' "

ante, at 432 (quoting Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec.Cooperative, Inc., 356 U. S. 525, 537 (1958) (footnote omitted)), requires federal courts of appeals to review districtcourt applications of state-law excessiveness standards for
an "abuse of discretion." Ante, at 438.The majority's persuasive demonstration that New York
law sets forth a substantive limitation on the size of juryawards seems to refute the contention that New York has
merely asked appellate courts to reexamine facts. The ma-jority's analysis would thus seem to undermine the conclusion that the Reexamination Clause is relevant to this case.Certainly, our decision in

Byrd does not make the Clauserelevant. There, we considered only whether the Seventh

Amendment's first clause should influence our decision togive effect to a state-law rule denying the right to a jury

6 Our per curiam decision in Donovan v. Penn Shipping Co., 429 U. S.
648 (1977), provides no support for the proposition that federal appellate
courts are confined to a federal standard of excessiveness. That case held
only that a plaintiff who had consented to a remittitur could not challenge
its adequacy on appeal. Id., at 649. Although we stated in dicta that
"[t]he proper role of the trial and appellate courts in the federal system in
reviewing the size of jury verdicts is, however, a matter of federal law,"
ibid., that broad statement was supported by citation to two cases, Hanna
v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460 (1965), and Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative, Inc., 356 U. S. 525 (1958), which did not involve the review of
jury awards.

altogether. 356 U. S., at 537. That holding in no way re-quires us to consult the Amendment's second clause to determine the standard of review for a district court's applicationof state substantive law.

My disagreement is tempered, however, because themajority carefully avoids defining too strictly the abuse-ofdiscretion standard it announces. To the extent that themajority relies only on "practical reasons" for its conclusion
that the Court of Appeals should give some weight to theDistrict Court's assessment in determining whether state
substantive law has been properly applied, ante, at 438, I donot disagree with its analysis.

As a matter of federal-court administration, we haverecognized in other contexts the need for according some
deference to the lower court's resolution of legal, yet fact-intensive, questions. See Ornelas v. United States, 517
U. S., at 699; Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 558, n. 1(1988). Indeed, it is a familiar, if somewhat circular, maxim
that deems an error of law an abuse of discretion.In the end, therefore, my disagreement with the label that
the majority attaches to the standard of appellate reviewshould not obscure the far more fundamental point on which
we agree. Whatever influence the Seventh Amendmentmay be said to exert,

Erie requires federal appellate courtssitting in diversity to apply "the damage-control standard

state law supplies." Ante, at 438.

Because I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Ap-peals, and because I do not agree that the Seventh Amendment in any respect influences the proper analysis of thequestion presented, I respectfully dissent.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

eral appellate courts from reviewing refusals by districtcourts to set aside civil jury awards as contrary to the weight

of the evidence. One reason is given for overruling thesecases: that the Courts of Appeals have, for some time now,
decided to ignore them. Such unreasoned capitulation tothe nullification of what was long regarded as a core component of the Bill of Rights--the Seventh Amendment'sprohibition on appellate reexamination of civil jury awards--
is wrong. It is not for us, much less for the Courts of Ap-peals, to decide that the Seventh Amendment's restriction
on federal-court review of jury findings has outlived itsusefulness.

The Court also holds today that a state practice that re-lates to the division of duties between state judges and juries
must be followed by federal courts in diversity cases. Onthis issue, too, our prior cases are directly to the contrary.

As I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals,I respectfully dissent.

I
Because the Court and I disagree as to the character ofthe review that is before us, I recount briefly the nature of

the New York practice rule at issue. Section 5501(c) of theN. Y. Civ. Prac. Law and Rules (CPLR) (McKinney 1995)
directs New York intermediate appellate courts faced with aclaim "that the award is excessive or inadequate and that a
new trial should have been granted" to determine whetherthe jury's award "deviates materially from what would be
reasonable compensation." In granting respondent a newtrial under this standard, the Court of Appeals necessarily
engaged in a two-step process. As it has explained the ap-plication of $ 5501(c), that provision "requires the reviewing
court to determine the range it regards as reasonable, andto determine whether the particular jury award deviates
materially from that range." Consorti v. Armstrong World
Industries, Inc., 72 F. 3d 1003, 1013 (CA2 1995) (amended).The first of these two steps--the determination as to "rea518us2$82K 05-18-99 18:37:58 PAGES OPINPGT
450 GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.

Scalia, J., dissenting
sonable" damages--plainly requires the reviewing court to
reexamine a factual matter tried by the jury: the appropriate
measure of damages, on the evidence presented, under New
York law. The second step--the determination as to the degree of difference between "reasonable" damages and the
damages found by the jury (whether the latter "deviates
materially" from the former)--establishes the degree of
judicial tolerance for awards found not to be reasonable,
whether at the trial level or by the appellate court. No part
of this exercise is appropriate for a federal court of appeals, whether or not it is sitting in a diversity case.

A
Granting appellate courts authority to decide whether an
award is "excessive or inadequate" in the manner of CPLR

$ 5501(c) may reflect a sound understanding of the capacities
of modern juries and trial judges. That is to say, the people
of the State of New York may well be correct that such a rule
contributes to a more just legal system. But the practice of
federal appellate reexamination of facts found by a jury is
precisely what the People of the several States considered
not to be good legal policy in 1791. Indeed, so fearful were
they of such a practice that they constitutionally prohibited
it by means of the Seventh Amendment.

That Amendment was Congress's response to one of the
principal objections to the proposed Constitution raised by
the Anti-Federalists during the ratification debates: its failure to ensure the right to trial by jury in civil actions in
federal court. The desire for an explicit constitutional guarantee against reexamination of jury findings was explained
by Justice Story, sitting as Circuit Justice in 1812, as having
been specifically prompted by Article III's conferral of "appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact" upon the Supreme Court. "[O]ne of the most powerful objections urged
against [the Constitution]," he recounted, was that this au518us2$82K 05-18-99 18:37:58 PAGES OPINPGT

thority "would enable that court, with or without a new jury,
to re-examine the whole facts, which had been settled by a
previous jury." United States v. Wonson, 28 F. Cas. 745, 750
(No. 16,750) (CC Mass.).1

The second clause of the Amendment responded to that
concern by providing that "[i]n [s]uits at common law . . . no
fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any
Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the
common law." U. S. Const., Amdt. 7. The Reexamination
Clause put to rest "apprehensions" of "new trials by the appellate courts," Wonson, 28 F. Cas., at 750, by adopting, in
broad fashion, "the rules of the common law" to govern
federal-court interference with jury determinations.2 The

1 This objection was repeatedly made following the Constitutional Convention, see, e. g., Martin, Genuine Information, in 3 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 172, 221-222 (M. Farrand ed. 1911); Gerry,
Reply to a Landholder, id., at 298, 299, and at the ratifying conventions in
the States, see, e. g., 3 J. Elliot, Debates on the Federal Constitution 525,
540-541, 544-546 (1863) (Virginia Convention, statements of Mr. Mason
and Mr. Henry); 4 id., at 151, 154 (North Carolina Convention, statements
of Mr. Bloodworth and Mr. Spencer).

Prior to adoption of the Amendment, these concerns were addressed by
Congress in the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, which expressly directed,
in providing for "reexamin[ation]" of civil judgments "upon a writ of
error," that "there shall be no reversal in either [the Circuit or Supreme
Court] . . . for any error of fact." $ 22, 1 Stat. 84-85. That restriction
remained in place until the 1948 revisions of the Judicial Code. See 62
Stat. 963, 28 U. S. C. $ 2105 (1946 ed., Supp. II).

2 The Amendment was relied upon at least twice to prevent actual new

trials. In Wonson itself, Justice Story rejected the United States' claim
of right to retry, on appeal, a matter unsuccessfully put before a jury in
the District Court--notwithstanding acceptance of such a practice under
local law. The court based its ruling on statutory grounds, but its interpretation of its statutory jurisdiction was dictated by its view that a
contrary interpretation would contravene the Seventh Amendment. 28
F. Cas., at 750. And in Justices v. Murray, 9 Wall. 274, 281 (1870), this
Court relied on Wonson in invalidating under the Seventh Amendment a
federal habeas statute that provided for removal of certain judgments
from state courts for purposes of retrial in federal court.

content of that law was familiar and fixed. See, e. g., ibid.
("[T]he common law here alluded to is not the common law
of any individual state, (for it probably differs in all), but it
is the common law of England, the grand reservoir of all our
jurisprudence"); Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S. 474, 487 (1935)
(Seventh Amendment "in effect adopted the rules of the
common law, in respect of trial by jury, as these rules existed
in 1791"). It quite plainly barred reviewing courts from entertaining claims that the jury's verdict was contrary to the
evidence.

At common law, review of judgments was had only on writ
of error, limited to questions of law. See, e. g., Wonson,
supra, at 748; 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws
of England 405 (1768) ("The writ of error only lies upon matter of law arising upon the face of the proceedings; so that
no evidence is required to substantiate or support it"); 1 W.
Holdsworth, History of English Law 213-214 (7th ed. 1956);
cf. Ross v. Rittenhouse, 2 Dall. 160, 163 (Pa. 1792) (McKean,
C. J.). That principle was expressly acknowledged by this
Court as governing federal practice in Parsons v. Bedford, 3
Pet. 433 (1830) (Story, J.). There, the Court held that no
error could be assigned to a district court's refusal to allow
transcription of witness testimony "to serve as a statement
of facts in case of appeal," notwithstanding the right to such
transcription under state practices made applicable to federal courts by Congress. Id., at 443 (emphasis deleted).
This was so, the Court explained, because "[t]he whole object" of the transcription was "to present the evidence here
in order to establish the error of the verdict in matters of
fact," id., at 445--a mode of review simply unavailable on
writ of error, see id., at 446, 448. The Court concluded that
Congress had not directed federal courts to follow state practices that would change "the effect or conclusiveness of the
verdict of the jury upon the facts litigated at the trial," id.,
at 449, because it had "the most serious doubts whether

[that] would not be unconstitutional" under the Seventh
Amendment, id., at 448.

"This is a prohibition to the courts of the United States
to re-examine any facts tried by a jury in any other manner. The only modes known to the common law to reexamine such facts, are the granting of a new trial by
the court where the issue was tried, or to which the
record was properly returnable; or the award of a venire
facias de novo, by an appellate court, for some error of
law which intervened in the proceedings.. . . . .

"[I]f the evidence were now before us, it would not be
competent for this court to reverse the judgment for any
error in the verdict of the jury at the trial . . . ." Id.,
at 447-449.

Nor was the common-law proscription on reexamination
limited to review of the correctness of the jury's determination of liability on the facts. No less than the existence of
liability, the proper measure of damages "involves only a
question of fact," St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Craft, 237
U. S. 648, 661 (1915), as does a "motio[n] for a new trial based
on the ground that the damages . . . are excessive," Metropolitan R. Co. v. Moore, 121 U. S. 558, 574 (1887). As appeals from denial of such motions necessarily pose a factual
question, courts of the United States are constitutionally forbidden to entertain them.

"No error of law appearing upon the record, this court
cannot reverse the judgment because, upon examination
of the evidence, we may be of the opinion that the jury
should have returned a verdict for a less amount. If
the jury acted upon a gross mistake of facts, or were
governed by some improper influence or bias, the remedy therefore rested with the court below, under its gen518us2$82K 05-18-99 18:37:58 PAGES OPINPGT

Respondent's principal response to these cases, which isendorsed by

Justice Stevens, see ante, at 443-445, is thatour forebears were simply wrong about the English common law. The rules of the common-law practice incorpo-rated in the Seventh Amendment, it is claimed, did not prevent judges sitting in an appellate capacity from granting anew trial on the ground that an award was contrary to the
weight of the evidence. This claim simply does not with-stand examination of the actual practices of the courts at
common law. The weight of the historical record stronglysupports the view of the common law taken in our early
cases.At common law, all major civil actions were initiated before panels of judges sitting at the courts of Westminster.Trial was not always held at the bar of the court, however.
The inconvenience of having jurors and witnesses travel toWestminster had given rise to the practice of allowing trials
to be held in the countryside, before a single itinerant judge.This nisi prius trial, as it was called, was limited to the
jury's deciding a matter of fact in dispute; once that was ac-complished, the verdict was entered on the record which--

Nonetheless, respondent argues, the role of the en banccourt at Westminster was essentially that of an appellate

body, reviewing the proceedings below; and those appellatejudges

were capable of examining the evidence, and of grant-ing a new trial when, in their view, the verdict was contrary

to the weight of the evidence. See Blume, Review of Factsin Jury Cases--The Seventh Amendment, 20 J. Am. Jud. Soc.
130, 131 (1936); Riddell, supra, at 55-57, 60. There are twodifficulties with this argument. The first is the characterization of the court at Westminster as an appellate body.The court's role with respect to the initiation of the action,
the entertaining of motions for new trial, and the entry ofjudgment was the same in all cases--whether the cause was
tried at the bar or at nisi prius. To regard its actions indeciding a motion for a new trial as "appellate" in the latter
instance supposes a functional distinction where none ex-isted. The second difficulty is that when the trial had been
held at nisi prius, the judges of the en banc court apparentlywould order a new trial only if the nisi prius judge certified
that he was dissatisfied with the verdict. To be sure, thereare many cases where no mention is made of the judge's certificate, but there are many indications that it was a requiredpredicate to setting aside a verdict rendered at nisi prius,
and respondent has been unable to identify a single casewhere a new trial was granted in the absence of such certification. In short, it would seem that a new trial could not

4 The grounds for granting a new trial were "want of notice of trial; or
any flagrant misbehavior of the party prevailing towards the jury, which
may have influenced their verdict; or any gross misbehavior of the jury
among themselves: also if it appears by the judge's report, certified to the
court, that the jury have brought in a verdict without or contrary to evidence, so that he is reasonably dissatisfied therewith; or if they have given
exorbitant damages; or if the judge himself has misdirected the jury, so
that they found an unjustifiable verdict." 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries

be had except upon the approval of the judge who presidedover the trial and heard the evidence.

I am persuaded that our prior cases were correct that, atcommon law, "reexamination" of the facts found by a jury

could be undertaken only by the trial court, and that appel-late review was restricted to writ of error which could challenge the judgment only upon matters of law. Even if therewere some doubt on the point, we should be hesitant to advance our view of the common law over that of our forbears,who were far better acquainted with the subject than we are.
But in any event, the question of how to apply the "rules ofthe common law" to federal appellate consideration of mo5 See ibid. (new trial would be granted "if it appears by the judge's
report, certified to the court, that the jury have brought in a verdict without or contrary to evidence, so that he is reasonably dissatisfied therewith"). See, e. g., Berks v. Mason, Say. 264, 265, 96 Eng. Rep. 874, 874-875
(K. B. 1756); Bright v. Eynon, 1 Burr. 390, 97 Eng. Rep. 365 (K. B. 1757);
see also Note, Limitations on Trial by Jury in Illinois, 19 Chi.-Kent L.
Rev. 91, 92 (1940) ("An exhaustive examination of the early English cases
has revealed not a single case where an English court at common law ever
granted a new trial, as being against the evidence, unless the judge or
judges who sat with the jury stated in open court, or certified, that the
verdict was against the evidence and he was dissatisfied with the verdict").

Justice Stevens understands Blackstone to say that new trials were
granted for excessiveness even where the nisi prius judge was not dissatisfied with the damages awarded, see ante, at 444-445. Blackstone's
phrasing certainly allows for this reading, see n. 4, supra, but what indications we have suggest that the dissatisfaction of the presiding judge
played the same role where the motion for new trial was based on a claim
of excessive damages as where based on a claim of an erroneous verdict.
See, e. g., Boulsworth v. Pilkington, Jones, T. 200, 84 Eng. Rep. 1216
(K. B. 1685); Redshaw v. Brook, 2 Wils. K. B. 405, 95 Eng. Rep. 887 (C. P.
1769); Sharpe v. Brice, 2 Black. W. 942, 96 Eng. Rep. 557 (C. P. 1774). The
cases cited by Justice Stevens, ante, at 444-445, n. 5, are not at all to
the contrary: In one, the case was tried at the bar of the court, so that
there was no nisi prius judge, see Wood v. Gunston, Sty. 466, 82 Eng.
Rep. 867 (K. B. 1655); in the other, the judge who had presided at trial
was on the panel that ruled on the new trial motion, and recommended a
new trial, see Bright v. Eynon, supra, at 390-391, 396-397, 97 Eng. Rep.,
at 365, 368.

tions for new trials is one that has already been clearly andcategorically answered, by our precedents. As we said in

Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U. S. 474 (1935), in discussing thestatus of remittitur under "the rules of the common law," a
doctrine that "has been accepted as the law for more than ahundred years and uniformly applied in the federal courts
during that time" and "finds some support in the practice ofthe English courts prior to the adoption of the Constitution"
will not lightly "be reconsidered or disturbed," id., at 484-485. The time to question whether orders on motions for a
new trial were in fact reviewable at common law has longsince passed. Cases of this Court reaching back into the
early 19th century establish that the Constitution forbidsfederal appellate courts to "reexamine" a fact found by the
jury at trial; and that this prohibition encompasses reviewof a district court's refusal to set aside a verdict as contrary
to the weight of the evidence.

C
The Court, as is its wont of late, all but ignores the rele-vant history. It acknowledges that federal appellate review

of district-court refusals to set aside jury awards as againstthe weight of the evidence was "once deemed inconsonant
with the Seventh Amendment's Reexamination Clause,"ante, at 434, but gives no indication of why ever we held that
view; and its citation of only one of our cases subscribing tothat proposition fails to convey how long and how clearly it
was a fixture of federal practice, see ibid. (citing only Lincolnv. Power, 151 U. S. 436 (1894)). That our earlier cases are so
poorly recounted is not surprising, however, given the scantanalysis devoted to the conclusion that "appellate review for
abuse of discretion is reconcilable with the Seventh Amendment," ante, at 435.No precedent of this Court affirmatively supports that

proposition. The cases upon which the Court relies neither

affirmed nor rejected the practice of appellate weight-ofthe-evidence review that has been adopted by the courts of
appeals--a development that, in light of our past cases,
amounts to studied waywardness by the intermediate appellate bench. Our unaccountable reluctance, in Grunenthal v.
Long Island R. Co., 393 U. S. 156, 158 (1968), and Neese v.
Southern R. Co., 350 U. S. 77 (1955), to stand by our precedents, and the undeniable illogic of our disposition of those
two cases--approving ourselves a district-court denial of a
new trial motion, so as not to have to confront the lawfulness
of reversal by the court of appeals--is authority of only the
weakest and most negative sort. Nor can any weight be
assigned to our statement in Browning-Ferris Industries of
Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 279 (1989),
seemingly approving appellate abuse-of-discretion review of
denials of new trials where punitive damages are claimed to
be excessive. Browning-Ferris, like Grunenthal and Neese,
explicitly avoided the question that is before us today, see
492 U. S., at 279, n. 25. Even more significantly, BrowningFerris involved review of a jury's punitive damages award.
Unlike the measure of actual damages suffered, which presents a question of historical or predictive fact, see, e. g.,
Craft, 237 U. S., at 661, the level of punitive damages is not
really a "fact" "tried" by the jury. In none of our cases holding that the Reexamination Clause prevents federal appellate review of claims of excessive damages does it appear
that the damages had a truly "punitive" component.

In any event, it is not this Court's statements that the
Court puts forward as the basis for dispensing with our prior
cases. Rather, it is the Courts of Appeals' unanimous
"agree[ment]" that they may review trial-court refusals to
set aside jury awards claimed to be against the weight of the
evidence. Ante, at 435. This current unanimity is deemed
controlling, notwithstanding the "relatively late" origin of
the practice, ante, at 434, and without any inquiry into the

reasoning set forth in those Court of Appeals decisions.6The Court contents itself with citations of two federal appellate cases and the assurances of two leading treatises thatthe view (however meager its intellectual provenance might
be) is universally held. See ante, at 435-436. To its credit,one of those treatises describes the "dramatic change in doctrine" represented by appellate abuse-of-discretion review ofdenials of new trial orders generally as having been "accomplished by a blizzard of dicta" that, through repetition alone,has "given legitimacy to a doctrine of doubtful constitutionality." 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practiceand Procedure $ 2819, pp. 200, 204 (2d ed. 1995).

The Court's only suggestion as to what rationale mightunderlie approval of abuse-of-discretion review is to be found

in a quotation from Dagnello v. Long Island R. Co., 289 F. 2d797 (CA2 1961), to the effect that review of denial of a new
trial motion, if conducted under a sufficiently deferentialstandard, poses only " `a question of law.' " Ante, at 435
(quoting Dagnello, supra, at 806). But that is not the testthat the Seventh Amendment sets forth. Whether or not it

6 The Second Circuit, notwithstanding its practice with respect to excessiveness claims, will not review a district court's determination that the
jury's liability ruling was supported by the weight of the evidence, see
Stonewall Ins. Co. v. Asbestos Claims Management, 73 F. 3d 1178, 1199
(1995) (such a decision is "one of those few rulings that is simply unavailable for appellate review"), and the Eighth Circuit has questioned whether
the Seventh Amendment permits appellate review of such determinations,
see Thongvanh v. Thalacker, 17 F. 3d 256, 259-260 (1994); see also White
v. Pence, 961 F. 2d 776, 782 (1992).

7 I am at a loss to understand the Court's charge that keeping faith with

our precedents--and requiring that the courts of appeals do likewise--
would " `destroy the uniformity of federal practice,' " ante, at 436, n. 19.
I had thought our decisions established uniformity. And as for commentators' observations that it would be " `astonishing' " for us actually to heed
our precedents, see ibid., quoting 11 Wright, Miller, & Kane, $ 2820, at
212, they are no more than a prediction of inconstancy--which the Court
today fulfills.

is possible to characterize an appeal of a denial of new trialas raising a "legal question," it is not possible to review such

a claim without engaging in a "reexamin[ation]" of the "factstried by the jury" in a manner "otherwise" than allowed at
common law. Determining whether a particular award is
excessive requires that one first determine the nature andextent of the harm--which undeniably requires reviewing

the facts of the case. That the court's review also entailsapplication of a legal standard (whether "shocks the conscience," "deviates materially," or some other) makes nodifference, for what is necessarily

also required is reexamination of facts found by the jury.In the last analysis, the Court frankly abandons any pretense at faithfulness to the common law, suggesting that "the
meaning" of the Reexamination Clause was not "fixed at1791,"

ante, at 436, n. 20, contrary to the view that all our
prior discussions of the Reexamination Clause have adopted,see

supra, at 451-454. The Court believes we can ignore
the very explicit command that "no fact tried by a jury shallbe otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States,

than according to the rules of the common law" because,after all, we have not insisted that juries be all male, or consist of 12 jurors, as they were at common law. Ante, at 436,
n. 20. This is a desperate analogy, since there is of courseno comparison between the specificity of the command of the

Reexamination Clause and the specificity of the commandthat there be a "jury." The footnote abandonment of our
traditional view of the Reexamination Clause is a major
step indeed.8

is the only case cited in the Court's footnote that arguably involved the
slightest departure from common-law practices regarding review of jury
findings. It held, to be sure, that a new trial could be ordered on damages
alone, even though at common law there was no practice of setting a verdict aside in part. But it did so only after satisfying itself that the change

The Court's holding that federal courts of appeals may review district-court denials of motions for new trials for error
of fact is not the only novel aspect of today's decision. The
Court also directs that the case be remanded to the District
Court, so that it may "test the jury's verdict against CPLR

$ 5501(c)'s `deviates materially' standard." Ante, at 439.
This disposition contradicts the principle that "[t]he proper
role of the trial and appellate courts in the federal system in
reviewing the size of jury verdicts is . . . a matter of federal
law." Donovan v. Penn Shipping Co., 429 U. S. 648, 649
(1977) (per curiam).

The Court acknowledges that state procedural rules cannot, as a general matter, be permitted to interfere with the
allocation of functions in the federal court system, see ante,
at 436-437. Indeed, it is at least partly for this reason that
the Court rejects direct application of $ 5501(c) at the appellate level as inconsistent with an " `essential characteristic' "
of the federal court system--by which the Court presumably
means abuse-of-discretion review of denials of motions for
new trials. See ante, at 431, 437-438. But the scope of the
Court's concern is oddly circumscribed. The "essential
characteristic" of the federal jury, and, more specifically, the
role of the federal trial court in reviewing jury judgments,
apparently counts for little. The Court approves the "acwas one of "form" rather than "substance," quoting Lord Mansfield to the
effect that " `for form's sake, we must set aside the whole verdict.' " Id.,
at 498 (quoting Edie v. East India Co., 1 Black W. 295, 298, 96 Eng. Rep.
166, 167 (K. B. 1761)). It can hardly be maintained that whether or not a
jury's damages award may be set aside on appeal is a matter of form.
The footnote also cites 9A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and
Procedure $ 2522 (2d ed. 1995), for its discussion of Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 50(b), which permits post-trial motion for judgment as a matter
of law. The Court neglects to mention that that discussion states: "The
Supreme Court held that reservation of the decision in this fashion had
been recognized at common law . . . ." Id., $ 2522, at 245.

commodat[ion]" achieved by having district courts reviewjury verdicts under the "deviates materially" standard, because it regards that as a means of giving effect to the State'spurposes "without disrupting the federal system," ante, at
437. But changing the standard by which trial judges re-view jury verdicts

does disrupt the federal system, and isplainly inconsistent with the "strong federal policy against

allowing state rules to disrupt the judge-jury relationship inthe federal court." Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative, Inc., 356 U. S. 525, 538 (1958).9 The Court's opinion doesnot even acknowledge, let alone address, this dislocation.

We discussed precisely the point at issue here inBrowning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal,
Inc., 492 U. S. 257 (1989), and gave an answer altogether con-trary to the one provided today. Browning-Ferris rejected
a request to fashion a federal common-law rule limiting thesize of punitive damages awards in federal courts, reaffirming the principle of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S.64 (1938), that "[i]n a diversity action, or in any other lawsuit
where state law provides the basis of decision, the proprietyof an award of punitive damages . . . , and the factors the jury
may consider in determining their amount, are questions ofstate law." 492 U. S., at 278. But the opinion expressly
stated that "[f]ederal law . . . will control on those issuesinvolving the proper review of the jury award by a federal
district court and court of appeals." Id., at 278-279. "Inreviewing an award of punitive damages," it said, "the role
of the district court is to determine whether the jury's ver-dict is within the confines set by state law, and to determine,
by reference to federal standards developed under Rule 59,whether a new trial or remittitur should be ordered."

Id.,at 279. The same distinction necessarily applies where the

9 Since I reject application of the New York standard on other grounds,
I need not consider whether it constitutes "reexamination" of a jury's verdict in a manner "otherwise . . . than according to the rules of the common law."

judgment under review is for compensatory damages: State
substantive law controls what injuries are compensable and
in what amount; but federal standards determine whether
the award exceeds what is lawful to such degree that it may
be set aside by order for new trial or remittitur.10

The Court does not disavow those statements in
Browning-Ferris (indeed, it does not even discuss them), but
it presumably overrules them, at least where the state rule
that governs "whether a new trial or remittitur should be
ordered" is characterized as "substantive" in nature. That,
at any rate, is the reason the Court asserts for giving

$ 5501(c) dispositive effect. The objective of that provision,
the Court states, "is manifestly substantive," ante, at 429,
since it operates to "contro[l] how much a plaintiff can be
awarded" by "tightening the range of tolerable awards," ante,
at 425, 426. Although "less readily classified" as substantive
than "a statutory cap on damages," it nonetheless "was
designed to provide an analogous control," ante, at 428, 429,
by making a new trial mandatory when the award "deviat[es]
materially" from what is reasonable, see ante, at 428-429.

I do not see how this can be so. It seems to me quite
wrong to regard this provision as a "substantive" rule for
Erie purposes. The "analog[y]" to "a statutory cap on damages," ante, at 428, 429, fails utterly. There is an absolutely
fundamental distinction between a rule of law such as that,
which would ordinarily be imposed upon the jury in the trial
court's instructions, and a rule of review, which simply determines how closely the jury verdict will be scrutinized for

10 Justice Stevens thinks that if an award " `exceeds what is lawful,' "
the result is "legal error" that "may be corrected" by the appellate court.
Ante, at 443, n. 2. But the sort of "legal error" involved here is the imposition of legal consequences (in this case, damages) in light of facts that,
under the law, may not warrant them. To suggest that every fact may
be reviewed, because what may ensue from an erroneous factual determination is a "legal error," is to destroy the notion that there is a factfinding
function reserved to the jury.

compliance with the instructions. A tighter standard for re-viewing jury determinations can no more plausibly be called

a "substantive" disposition than can a tighter appellatestandard for reviewing trial-court determinations. The one,
like the other, provides additional assurance that the law has
been complied with; but the other, like the one, leaves the
law unchanged.

The Court commits the classic Erie mistake of regardingwhatever changes the outcome as substantive, see

ante, at
428-431. That is not the only factor to be considered. See
Byrd, supra, at 537 ("[W]ere `outcome' the only consideration, a strong case might appear for saying that the federal
court should follow the state practice. But there are affirmative countervailing considerations at work here").
Outcome determination "was never intended to serve as a
talisman," Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S. 460, 466-467 (1965),
and does not have the power to convert the most classic elements of the process of assuring that the law is observed into
the substantive law itself. The right to have a jury make
the findings of fact, for example, is generally thought to favor
plaintiffs, and that advantage is often thought significant
enough to be the basis for forum selection. But no one
would argue that Erie confers a right to a jury in federal
court wherever state courts would provide it; or that, were it
not for the Seventh Amendment, Erie would require federal
courts to dispense with the jury whenever state courts do so.

In any event, the Court exaggerates the difference that
the state standard will make. It concludes that different
outcomes are likely to ensue depending on whether the law
being applied is the state "deviates materially" standard of

$ 5501(c) or the "shocks the conscience" standard. See ante,
at 429-430. Of course it is not the federal appellate standard but the federal district-court standard for granting new
trials that must be compared with the New York standard
to determine whether substantially different results will obtain--and it is far from clear that the district-court standard

466 GASPERINI v. CENTER FOR HUMANITIES, INC.

Scalia, J., dissenting
ought to be "shocks the conscience." 11 Indeed, it is not evenclear (as the Court asserts) that "shocks the conscience" is

the standard (erroneous or not) actually applied by the dis-trict courts of the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit's test
for reversing a grant of a new trial for an excessive verdictis whether the award was "

clearly within the maximum limitof a reasonable range," Ismail v. Cohen, 899 F. 2d 183, 186

(CA2 1990) (internal quotation marks omitted), so any dis-trict court that uses that standard will be affirmed. And
while many district-court decisions express the "shocks theconscience" criterion, see,

e. g., Koerner v. Club Mediterranee, S. A., 833 F. Supp. 327, 333 (SDNY 1993), some have
used a standard of "indisputably egregious," Banff v. Express, Inc., 921 F. Supp. 1065, 1069 (SDNY 1995), or have
adopted the inverse of the Second Circuit's test for reversinga grant of new trial, namely, "

clearly outside the maximum
limit of a reasonable range," Paper Corp. v. Schoeller Technical Papers, Inc., 807 F. Supp. 337, 350-351 (SDNY 1992).
Moreover, some decisions that say "shocks the conscience"in fact apply a rule much less stringent. One case, for example, says that any award that would not be sustained under
the New York "deviates materially" rule "shocks the con-science." See

In re Joint Eastern & S. Dist. Asbestos Litigation, 798 F. Supp. 925, 937 (E&SDNY 1992), rev'd on othergrounds, 995 F. 2d 343, 346 (CA2 1993). In sum, it is at least

highly questionable whether the consistent outcome differen-tial claimed by the Court even exists. What seems to me
far more likely to produce forum shopping is the consistentdifference between the state and federal

appellate standards, which the Court leaves untouched. Under the Court's

11 That the "shocks the conscience" standard was not the traditional one
would seem clear from the opinion of Justice Story, quoted approvingly by
the Court, ante, at 433, to the effect that remittitur should be granted "if
it should clearly appear that the jury . . . have given damages excessive
in relation to the person or the injury." Blunt v. Little, 3 F. Cas. 760,
761-762 (No. 1,578) (CC Mass. 1822).

disposition, the Second Circuit reviews only for abuse of dis-cretion, whereas New York's appellate courts engage in a

de novo review for material deviation, giving the defendanta double shot at getting the damages award set aside. The
only result that would produce the conformity the Court erroneously believes Erie requires is the one adopted by theSecond Circuit and rejected by the Court:

de novo federal
appellate review under the $ 5501(c) standard.To say that application of $ 5501(c) in place of the federal

standard will not consistently produce disparate results isnot to suggest that the decision the Court has made today is
not a momentous one. The principle that the state standard
governs is of great importance, since it bears the potential
to destroy the uniformity of federal practice and the integrity of the federal court system. Under the Court's view, a
state rule that directed courts "to determine that an award
is excessive or inadequate if it deviates in any degree from
the proper measure of compensation" would have to be applied in federal courts, effectively requiring federal judges
to determine the amount of damages de novo, and effectively
taking the matter away from the jury entirely. Cf. Byrd,
356 U. S., at 537-538. Or consider a state rule that allowed
the defendant a second trial on damages, with judgment ultimately in the amount of the lesser of two jury awards. Cf.
United States v. Wonson, 28 F. Cas., at 747-748 (describing
Massachusetts practice by which a second jury trial could be
had on appeal). Under the reasoning of the Court's opinion,
even such a rule as that would have to be applied in the
federal courts.

The foregoing describes why I think the Court's Erie analysis is flawed. But in my view, one does not even reach the
Erie question in this case. The standard to be applied by a
district court in ruling on a motion for a new trial is set forth
in Rule 59 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which
provides that "[a] new trial may be granted . . . for any of the
reasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted in

actions at law in the courts of the United States." (Empha-sis added.) That is undeniably a federal standard.

12 Federal District Courts in the Second Circuit have interpretedthat standard to permit the granting of new trials where " `it

is quite clear that the jury has reached a seriously erroneousresult' " and letting the verdict stand would result in a " `miscarriage of justice.' " Koerner v. Club Mediterranee, S. A.,
supra, at 331 (quoting Bevevino v. Saydjari, 574 F. 2d 676,684 (CA2 1978)). Assuming (as we have no reason to question) that this is a correct interpretation of what Rule 59requires, it is undeniable that the Federal Rule is " `sufficiently broad' to cause a `direct collision' with the state lawor, implicitly, to `control the issue' before the court, thereby
leaving no room for the operation of that law." Burlington
Northern R. Co. v. Woods, 480 U. S. 1, 4-5 (1987). It is sim-ply not possible to give controlling effect both to the federal

standard and the state standard in reviewing the jury'saward. That being so, the court has no choice but to apply
the Federal Rule, which is an exercise of what we have calledCongress's "power to regulate matters which, though falling
within the uncertain area between substance and procedure,are rationally capable of classification as either,"

birth to the Reexamination Clause of the Seventh Amend-ment. Alas, those who drew the Amendment, and the citizens who approved it, did not envision an age in which theConstitution means whatever this Court thinks it ought to
mean--or indeed, whatever the courts of appeals have re-cently thought it ought to mean.

When there is added to the revision of the SeventhAmendment the Court's precedent-setting disregard of Congress's instructions in Rule 59, one must conclude that thisis a bad day for the Constitution's distinctive Article III

MEDTRONIC, INC. v. LOHR et vir
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 95-754. Argued April 23, 1996--Decided June 26, 1996*
Enacted "to provide for the safety and effectiveness of medical devices

intended for human use," the Medical Device Amendments of 1976
(MDA or Act) classifies such devices based on the risk that they pose to
the public. Class III devices pose the greatest risk and, thus, are subject to a rigorous premarket approval (PMA) process. However, most
Class III devices on the market have not been through the PMA process
due to two statutory exceptions. Realizing that existing devices could
not be withdrawn from the market while the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) completed PMA analyses, Congress included a provision
allowing pre-1976 devices to remain on the market without FDA approval until the requisite PMA is completed. The Act also permits devices that are "substantially equivalent" to pre-existing devices to avoid
the PMA process until the FDA initiates the process for the underlying
device. The FDA uses a "premarket notification" submitted by all
manufacturers ($ 510(k) process) to determine substantial equivalence
for Class III devices. Petitioner Medtronic, Inc.'s pacemaker is a Class
III device found substantially equivalent under the $ 510(k) process.
Cross-petitioners, Lora Lohr and her spouse, filed a Florida state-court
suit alleging both negligence and strict-liability claims in the failure of
her Medtronic pacemaker, but Medtronic removed the case to the Federal District Court. That court ultimately dismissed the complaint as
having been pre-empted by 21 U. S. C. $ 360k(a), which provides that
"no State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in
effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement
(1) which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable
under [the MDA] to the device, and (2) which relates to the safety or
effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under [the Act]." The Court of Appeals
reversed in part and affirmed in part, concluding that the Lohrs' negligent design claims were not pre-empted, but that their negligent manufacturing and failure to warn claims were.

*Together with No. 95-886, Lohr et vir v. Medtronic, Inc., also on certiorari to the same court.

Held: The judgment is reversed in part and affirmed in part, and the cases

are remanded.

56 F. 3d 1335, reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II, III, V, and VII, concluding that the MDA does not pre-empt
the Lohrs' common-law claims. Pp. 484-486; 492-502; 503.

(a) While the Court need not go beyond $ 360k(a)'s pre-emptive language to determine whether Congress intended the MDA to pre-empt
at least some state law, see Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S.
504, 517, "the domain expressly pre-empted" by that language must be
identified, ibid. Interpretation of the text is informed by the assumptions that the States' historic police powers cannot be superseded
by a Federal Act unless that is Congress' clear and manifest purpose,
Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230, and that any understanding of a pre-emption statute's scope rests primarily on "a fair
understanding of congressional purpose," Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 530,
n. 27. Pp. 484-486.

(b) The Lohrs' negligent design claims are not pre-empted. The
FDA's "substantially equivalent" determination as well as its continuing
authority to exclude a device from the market do not amount to a specific, federally enforceable design requirement that would be affected
by state-law pressures such as those imposed here. Since the $ 510(k)
process is focused on equivalence, not safety, substantial equivalence
determinations provide little protection to the public. Neither the statutory scheme nor legislative history suggests that the $ 510(k) process
was intended to do anything other than maintain the status quo, which
included the possibility that a device's manufacturer would have to defend itself against state-law negligent design claims. Pp. 492-494.

(c) Section 360k(a) does not pre-empt state rules that merely duplicate the FDA's rules regulating manufacturing practices and labeling.
That the state requirements may be narrower than the federal rules
does not make them "different" under $ 360k. Nor does the presence of
a damages remedy amount to an additional or different "requirement";
it merely provides another reason for manufacturers to comply with
identical existing federal law "requirements." This view is supported
by the regulations of the FDA, to which Congress has delegated authority to implement the MDA. Pp. 494-497.

(d) The Lohrs' manufacturing and labeling claims are not pre-empted.
Although the statutory and regulatory language may not preclude "general" federal requirements from ever pre-empting state requirements,
or "general" state requirements from ever being pre-empted, it is impossible to ignore its overarching concern that pre-emption occur only

where a particular state requirement threatens to interfere with a specific federal interest. State requirements must be "with respect to"
medical devices and "different from, or in addition to," federal requirements. They must also relate "to the safety or effectiveness of the
device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the
device," and the regulations provide that state requirements of general
applicability are pre-empted only where they have "the effect of establishing a substantive requirement for a specific device." Federal requirements must be "applicable to the device" in question, and, according to the regulations, pre-empt state law only if they are "specific
counterpart regulations" or "specific" to a "particular device." The federal manufacturing and labeling requirements at issue reflect important
but entirely generic concerns about device regulation generally, not the
sort of concerns regarding a specific device or field of device regulation
which the statute or regulations were designed to protect from potentially contradictory state requirements. Similarly, Florida's commonlaw requirements were not specifically developed "with respect to" medical devices and, thus, are not the kinds of requirements that Congress
and the FDA feared would impede implementation and enforcement of
specific federal requirements. Pp. 497-502.

Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter,
and Justice Ginsburg, concluded in Part IV that Medtronic's argument that any common-law cause of action is a "requirement" under

$ 360k(a) is implausible, for it would grant complete immunity from
design defect liability to an entire industry that, in Congress' judgment,
needed more stringent regulation. It would take language much
plainer than $ 360k's text to do that. The word "requirement," which
appears to presume that the State is imposing a specific duty upon the
manufacturer, would be an odd term to use to indicate the sweeping
pre-emption Medtronic urges here. Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 521-522,
distinguished. The legislation's basic purpose and history entirely support the rejection of such an extreme position. Pp. 486-491.

Justice Breyer concluded that, although the MDA will sometimes
pre-empt a state-law tort suit, it does not pre-empt the claims at issue
here. First, since the MDA's pre-emption provision is highly ambiguous, Congress must have intended that courts look elsewhere for help
as to just which federal requirements pre-empt just which state requirements, as well as just how they might do so. Second, in the absence of
a clear congressional command as to pre-emption, courts may infer that
the relevant administrative agency possesses a degree of leeway to determine which rules, regulations, or other administrative actions will
have pre-emptive effect. See Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 721. Third, the FDA's regula518us2$83z 05-18-99 18:58:29 PAGES OPINPGT

tions indicate that the FDA does not consider that its requirements
pre-empt the state requirements at issue here. Fourth, ordinary principles of "conflict" and "field" pre-emption support the conclusion that
plaintiffs' tort claims are not pre-empted. Pp. 503-508.

Congress enacted the Medical Device Amendments of1976, in the words of the statute's preamble, "to provide for

the safety and effectiveness of medical devices intendedfor human use." 90 Stat. 539. The question presented is
whether that statute pre-empts a state common-law negli-gence action against the manufacturer of an allegedly defective medical device. Specifically, we must consider whetherLora Lohr, who was injured when her pacemaker failed, may
rely on Florida common law to recover damages from Med-tronic, Inc., the manufacturer of the device.

Opinion of the Court

I
Throughout our history the several States have exercisedtheir police powers to protect the health and safety of their

citizens. Because these are "primarily, and historically, . . .matter[s] of local concern,"

Hillsborough County v. Auto-mated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 719 (1985),

the "States traditionally have had great latitude under theirpolice powers to legislate as to the protection of the lives,
limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons," Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 756 (1985)(internal quotation marks omitted).

Despite the prominence of the States in matters of publichealth and safety, in recent decades the Federal Government
has played an increasingly significant role in the protectionof the health of our people. Congress' first significant enactment in the field of public health was the Food and DrugAct of 1906, a broad prohibition against the manufacture or
shipment in interstate commerce of any adulterated or mis-branded food or drug. See 34 Stat. 768; Regier, The Struggle for Federal Food and Drugs Legislation, 1 Law &Contemp. Prob. 1 (1933). Partly in response to an ongoing
concern about radio and newspaper advertising making falsetherapeutic claims for both "quack machines" and legitimate
devices such as surgical instruments and orthopedic shoes,in 1938 Congress broadened the coverage of the 1906 Act to
include misbranded or adulterated medical devices and cos-metics. See Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938
(FDCA), $$ 501, 502, 52 Stat. 1049-1051; Cavers, The Food,Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938: Its Legislative History and
Its Substantive Provisions, 6 Law & Contemp. Prob. 2 (1939);H. R. Rep. No. 94-853, p. 6 (1976).

While the FDCA provided for premarket approval of newdrugs, Cavers, 6 Law & Contemp. Prob., at 40, it did not
authorize any control over the introduction of new medicaldevices, see S. Rep. No. 93-670, pp. 1-2 (1974); H. R. Rep.
No. 94-853, at 6. As technologies advanced and medicine

relied to an increasing degree on a vast array of medicalequipment "[f]rom bedpans to brainscans,"

dialysis units, artificial heart valves, and heart pacemakers,2policymakers and the public became concerned about the

increasingly severe injuries that resulted from the failureof such devices. See generally Finck, The Effectiveness of
FDA Medical Device Regulation, 7 U. C. D. L. Rev. 293, 297-301 (1974); H. R. Rep. No. 94-853, at 7.

In 1970, for example, the Dalkon Shield, an intrauterinecontraceptive device, was introduced to the American public
and throughout the world. Touted as a safe and effectivecontraceptive, the Dalkon Shield resulted in a disturbingly
high percentage of inadvertent pregnancies, serious infec-tions, and even, in a few cases, death. Id., at 8; Regulation

on Government Operations, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. (1973). Inthe early 1970's, several other devices, including catheters,
artificial heart valves, defibrillators, and pacemakers (includ-ing pacemakers manufactured by petitioner Medtronic), attracted the attention of consumers, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Congress as possible health risks.See Medical Device Amendments, 1973, Hearings before the

Subcommittee on Health of the Senate Committee on Laborand Public Welfare, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., 270-361 (1973).

In response to the mounting consumer and regulatory con-cern, Congress enacted the statute at issue here: the Medical

sent no unreasonable risk of illness or injury are designated
Class I and are subject only to minimal regulation by "general controls." 21 U. S. C. $ 360c(a)(1)(A). Devices that are
potentially more harmful are designated Class II; although
they may be marketed without advance approval, manufacturers of such devices must comply with federal performance
regulations known as "special controls. " $ 360c(a)(1)(B).
Finally, devices that either "presen[t] a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury," or which are "purported or
represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining
human life or for a use which is of substantial importance in
preventing impairment of human health," are designated
Class III. $ 360c(a)(1)(C). Pacemakers are Class III devices. See 21 CFR $ 870.3610 (1995).

Before a new Class III device may be introduced to the
market, the manufacturer must provide the FDA with a
"reasonable assurance" that the device is both safe and effective. See 21 U. S. C. $ 360e(d)(2). Despite its relatively
innocuous phrasing, the process of establishing this "reasonable assurance," which is known as the "premarket approval," or "PMA" process, is a rigorous one. Manufacturers must submit detailed information regarding the safety
and efficacy of their devices, which the FDA then reviews,
spending an average of 1,200 hours on each submission.
Hearings before the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment of the House Committee on Energy & Commerce,
100th Cong., 1st Sess. (Ser. No. 100-34), p. 384 (1987) (hereinafter 1987 Hearings); see generally Kahan, Premarket Approval Versus Premarket Notification: Different Routes to
the Same Market, 39 Food Drug Cosm. L. J. 510, 512-514
(1984).

Not all, nor even most, Class III devices on the market
today have received premarket approval because of two important exceptions to the PMA requirement. First, Congress realized that existing medical devices could not be

Opinion of the Court
withdrawn from the market while the FDA completed itsPMA analysis for those devices. The statute therefore includes a "grandfathering" provision which allows pre-1976devices to remain on the market without FDA approval until
such time as the FDA initiates and completes the requisite
PMA. See 21 U. S. C. $ 360e(b)(1)(A); 21 CFR $ 814.1(c)(1)
(1995).3 Second, to prevent manufacturers of grandfathered
devices from monopolizing the market while new devices
clear the PMA hurdle, and to ensure that improvements to
existing devices can be rapidly introduced into the market,
the Act also permits devices that are "substantially equivalent" to pre-existing devices to avoid the PMA process. See
21 U. S. C. $ 360e(b)(1)(B).

Although "substantially equivalent" Class III devices may
be marketed without the rigorous PMA review, such new
devices, as well as all new Class I and Class II devices, are
subject to the requirements of $ 360(k). That section imposes a limited form of review on every manufacturer intending to market a new device by requiring it to submit a "premarket notification" to the FDA (the process is also known
as a "$ 510(k) process," after the number of the section in the
original Act). If the FDA concludes on the basis of the

$ 510(k) notification that the device is "substantially equivalent" to a pre-existing device, it can be marketed without
further regulatory analysis (at least until the FDA initiates
the PMA process for the underlying pre-1976 device to which
the new device is "substantially equivalent"). The $ 510(k)
notification process is by no means comparable to the PMA

3 The FDA has not yet initiated nor suggested the initiation of a PMA
process for pacemakers or most other grandfathered devices. But see 60
Fed. Reg. 41984, 41986 (1995) (pursuant to Safe Medical Devices Act of
1990, 104 Stat. 4511, calling for submission of information by February
1997 which may lead the FDA to reclassify or initiate PMA process at
some time in the future for implantable pacemaker pulse generators and
lead adapters).

Opinion of the Court
process; in contrast to the 1,200 hours necessary to complete
a PMA review, the $ 510(k) review is completed in an average
of only 20 hours. See 1987 Hearings, at 384. As one commentator noted: "The attraction of substantial equivalence
to manufacturers is clear. [Section] 510(k) notification requires little information, rarely elicits a negative response
from the FDA, and gets processed very quickly." Adler,
The 1976 Medical Device Amendments: A Step in the Right
Direction Needs Another Step in the Right Direction, 43
Food Drug Cosm. L. J. 511, 516 (1988); see also Kahan, 39
Food Drug Cosm. L. J., at 514-519.

Congress anticipated that the FDA would complete the
PMA process for Class III devices relatively swiftly. But
because of the substantial investment of time and energy
necessary for the resolution of each PMA application, the
ever-increasing numbers of medical devices, and internal administrative and resource difficulties, the FDA simply could
not keep up with the rigorous PMA process. As a result,
the $ 510(k) premarket notification process became the means
by which most new medical devices--including Class III devices--were approved for the market. In 1983, for instance,
a House Report concluded that nearly 1,000 of approximately
1,100 Class III devices that had been introduced to the market since 1976 were admitted as "substantial equivalents"
and without any PMA review. See Medical Device Regulation: The FDA's Neglected Child (Committee Print compiled
for the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the
House Committee on Energy and Commerce), Comm. Print
98-F, p. 34 (1983). This lopsidedness has apparently not
evened out; despite an increasing effort by the FDA to consider the safety and efficacy of substantially equivalent devices, the House reported in 1990 that 80% of new Class III
devices were being introduced to the market through the

$ 510(k) process and without PMA review. H. R. Rep.

As have so many other medical device manufacturers,
petitioner Medtronic took advantage of $ 510(k)'s expedited
process in October 1982, when it notified the FDA that
it intended to market its Model 4011 pacemaker lead as a
device that was "substantially equivalent" to devices already
on the market. (The lead is the portion of a pacemaker that
transmits the heartbeat-steadying electrical signal from
the "pulse generator" to the heart itself.) On November
30, 1982, the FDA found that the model was "substantially
equivalent to devices introduced into interstate commerce"
prior to the effective date of the Act, and advised Medtronic
that it could therefore market its device subject only to the
general control provisions of the Act, which could be found
in the Code of Federal Regulations. See Respondent's
Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment
in No. 93-482 (MD Fla., Nov. 1, 1993), Exh. A to Exh. 1 (Declaration of Charles H. Swanson) (hereinafter FDA Substantial Equivalence Letter). The agency emphasized, however,
that this determination should not be construed as an endorsement of the pacemaker lead's safety. Ibid.

technology for the proper functioning of her heart. In 1987

cause of the failure.

In 1993 Lohr and her husband filed this action in a Florida
state court. Their complaint contained both a negligence
count and a strict-liability count. The negligence count alleged a breach of Medtronic's "duty to use reasonable care
in the design, manufacture, assembly, and sale of the subject
pacemaker" in several respects, including the use of defective materials in the lead and a failure to warn or properly
instruct the plaintiff or her physicians of the tendency of the
pacemaker to fail, despite knowledge of other earlier failures.
Complaint || 5. The strict-liability count alleged that the device was in a defective condition and unreasonably dangerous
to foreseeable users at the time of its sale. Id., || 11. (A
third count alleging breach of warranty was dismissed for
failure to state a claim under Florida law.)

Medtronic removed the case to Federal District Court,
where it filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that
both the negligence and strict-liability claims were preempted by 21 U. S. C. $ 360k(a). That section, which is at
the core of the dispute between the parties in this suit,
provides:

"$ 360k. State and local requirements respecti ng

"Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section,
no State or political subdivision of a State may establish
or continue in effect with respect to a device intended
for human use any requirement--

Opinion of the Court
"(2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of thedevice or to any other matter included in a requirement

applicable to the device under this chapter." 5
The District Court initially denied Medtronic's motion,finding nothing in the statute to support the company's argument that the MDA entirely exempted from liability a manu-facturer who had allegedly violated the FDA's regulations.
See App. to Pet. for Cert. 5d. Not long after that decision,however, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit concluded that $ 360k required pre-emption ofat least some common-law claims brought against the manu5 Subsection (b) of the statute authorizes the FDA to grant exemptions
to state requirements that would otherwise be pre-empted by subsection
(a). Section 360k(b) provides:

"(b) Exempt requirements

"Upon application of a State or a political subdivision thereof, the Secretary may, by regulation promulgated after notice and opportunity for an
oral hearing, exempt from subsection (a) of this section, under such conditions as may be prescribed in such regulation, a requirement of such State
or political subdivision applicable to a device intended for human use if--

"(1) the requirement is more stringent than a requirement under this
chapter which would be applicable to the device if an exemption were not
in effect under this subsection; or

"(2) the requirement--
"(A) is required by compelling local conditions, and
"(B) compliance with the requirement would not cause the device to be
in violation of any applicable requirement under this chapter."

To carry out this grant of authority, the FDA has issued regulations
under the statute which both construe the scope of $ 360k(a) and address
the instances in which the FDA will grant exemptions to its pre-emptive
effect. See 21 CFR $ 808.1 (1995); n. 18, infra.

We note that although it is the FDA that exercises this authority, the
Act gives that authority directly to the Secretary of Health and Human
Services, who subsequently delegated her authority to the FDA. See,
e. g., 21 U. S. C. $ 360k(b) ("the Secretary may" exempt state requirements), $ 321(d) ("Secretary" defined as "the Secretary of Health and
Human Services"). Under the FDCA, the Secretary is vested with "[t]he
authority to promulgate regulations for the efficient enforcement of" the
Act. 21 U. S. C. $ 371(a).

Opinion of the Court
facturer of a medical device. See Duncan v. Iolab Corp., 12F. 3d 194 (1994). After reconsidering its ruling in light of

Duncan, the District Court reversed its earlier decision anddismissed the Lohrs' entire complaint.

The Court of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in
part. 56 F. 3d 1335 (CA11 1995). Rejecting the Lohrs'broadest submission, it first decided that "common law

actions are state requirements within the meaning of$ 360k(a)."

Id., at 1342. It next held that pre-emption
could not be avoided by merely alleging that the negligenceflowed from a violation of federal standards.

Id., at 1343.
Then, after concluding that the term "requirements" in

$ 360k(a) was unclear, it sought guidance from FDA's regulations regarding pre-emption. Those regulations provide
that a state requirement is not pre-empted unless the FDA
has established " `specific requirements applicable to a particular device.' " Id., at 1344 (citing 21 CFR $ 808.1(d) (1995)).
Under these regulations, the court concluded, it was not necessary that the federal regulation specifically deal with pacemakers, but only that the federal requirement "should, in
some way, be `restricted by nature' to a particular process,
procedure, or device and should not be completely openended," 56 F. 3d, at 1346 (footnote omitted), and that the
specific device at issue should be subject to its requirements.

Under this approach, the court concluded that the Lohrs'
negligent design claims were not pre-empted. It rejected
Medtronic's argument that the FDA's finding of "substantial
equivalence" had any significance with respect to the pacemaker's safety, or that the FDA's continued surveillance of
the device constituted a federal "requirement" that its design
be maintained. Id., at 1347-1349. On the other hand, it
concluded that the negligent manufacturing and failure to
warn claims were pre-empted by FDA's general "good manufacturing practices" regulations, which establish general requirements for most steps in every device's manufacture, see
id., at 1350; 21 CFR $$ 820.20-820.198 (1995), and by the

Opinion of the Court
FDA labeling regulations, which require devices to bear var-ious warnings, see 56 F. 3d, at 1350-1351; 21 CFR $ 801.109

(1995). The court made a parallel disposition of the strict-liability claims, holding that there was no pre-emption insofar as plaintiffs alleged an unreasonably dangerous design,but they could not revive the negligent manufacturing or
failure to warn claims under a strict-liability theory. 56
F. 3d, at 1351-1352.Medtronic filed a petition for certiorari seeking review of

the Court of Appeals' decision insofar as it affirmed the Dis-trict Court and the Lohrs filed a cross-petition seeking review of the judgment insofar as it upheld the pre-emptiondefense. Because the Courts of Appeals are divided over
the extent to which state common-law claims are pre-empted
by the MDA,6 we granted both petitions. 516 U. S. 1087(1996).

III
As in Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504 (1992),we are presented with the task of interpreting a statutory

provision that expressly pre-empts state law. While thepre-emptive language of $ 360k(a) means that we need not go
beyond that language to determine whether Congress intended the MDA to pre-empt at least some state law, see id.,at 517, we must nonetheless "identify the domain expressly

pre-empted" by that language, ibid. Although our analysisof the scope of the pre-emption statute must begin with its
text, see Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Assn.,

6 See, e. g., English v. Mentor Corp., 67 F. 3d 477 (CA3 1995) ($ 510(k)
process creates pre-emptive "requirements"); Feldt v. Mentor Corp., 61
F. 3d 431 (CA5 1995) ($ 510(k) process does not create pre-emptive "requirements"); Michael v. Shiley, Inc., 46 F. 3d 1316 (CA3 1995) (claim alleging violation of federal requirement not pre-empted); 56 F. 3d 1335 (CA11
1995) (case below) (claim alleging violation of federal requirement may
be pre-empted; $ 510(k) process may create pre-emptive requirements;
common-law claims covered by $ 360k(a)); Kennedy v. Collagen Corp., 67
F. 3d 1453 (CA9 1995) (common-law claims not covered at all by $ 360k(a)).

Opinion of the Court
505 U. S. 88, 111 (1992) (Kennedy, J., concurring in part andconcurring in judgment), our interpretation of that language

does not occur in a contextual vacuum. Rather, that inter-pretation is informed by two presumptions about the nature
of pre-emption. See ibid.

First, because the States are independent sovereigns inour federal system, we have long presumed that Congress

does not cavalierly pre-empt state-law causes of action. Inall pre-emption cases, and particularly in those in which Congress has "legislated . . . in a field which the States havetraditionally occupied,"

Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331
U. S. 218, 230 (1947), we "start with the assumption that the
historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress." Ibid.; Hillsborough Cty., 471
U. S., at 715-716; cf. Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482
U. S. 1, 22 (1987). Although dissenting Justices have argued
that this assumption should apply only to the question
whether Congress intended any pre-emption at all, as opposed to questions concerning the scope of its intended invalidation of state law, see Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 545-546
(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in
part), we used a "presumption against the pre-emption of
state police power regulations" to support a narrow interpretation of such an express command in Cipollone. Id., at
518, 523. That approach is consistent with both federalism
concerns and the historic primacy of state regulation of matters of health and safety.

Second, our analysis of the scope of the statute's preemption is guided by our oft-repeated comment, initially
made in Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 375 U. S. 96, 103
(1963), that "[t]he purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone" in every pre-emption case. See, e. g., Cipollone, 505
U. S., at 516; Gade, 505 U. S., at 96; Malone v. White Motor
Corp., 435 U. S. 497, 504 (1978). As a result, any understanding of the scope of a pre-emption statute must rest pri518us2$83I 05-18-99 18:58:29 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Stevens, J.
marily on "a fair understanding of congressional purpose."Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 530, n. 27 (opinion of

Stevens, J.).Congress' intent, of course, primarily is discerned from the

language of the pre-emption statute and the "statutoryframework" surrounding it.

Gade, 505 U. S., at 111 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).Also relevant, however, is the "structure and purpose of the

statute as a whole," id., at 98 (opinion of O'Connor, J.), asrevealed not only in the text, but through the reviewing
court's reasoned understanding of the way in which Congressintended the statute and its surrounding regulatory scheme
to affect business, consumers, and the law.With these considerations in mind, we turn first to a consideration of petitioner Medtronic's claim that the Court ofAppeals should have found the entire action pre-empted and
then to the merits of the Lohrs' cross-petition.

IV
In its petition, Medtronic argues that the Court of Appealserred by concluding that the Lohrs' claims alleging negligent

design were not pre-empted by 21 U. S. C. $ 360k(a). Thatsection provides that "no State or political subdivision of a
State may establish or continue in effect with respect to adevice intended for human use any requirement (1) which is
different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicableunder this chapter to the device, and (2) which relates to the
safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matterincluded in a requirement applicable to the device under this
chapter." Medtronic suggests that any common-law causeof action is a "requirement" which alters incentives and imposes duties "different from, or in addition to," the genericfederal standards that the FDA has promulgated in response
to mandates under the MDA. In essence, the company ar-gues that the plain language of the statute pre-empts any
and all common-law claims brought by an injured plaintiffagainst a manufacturer of medical devices.

487Cite as: 518 U. S. 470 (1996)
Opinion of Stevens, J.
Medtronic's argument is not only unpersuasive, it is im-plausible. Under Medtronic's view of the statute, Congress

effectively precluded state courts from affording state con-sumers any protection from injuries resulting from a defective medical device. Moreover, because there is no explicit
private cause of action against manufacturers contained inthe MDA, and no suggestion that the Act created an implied

private right of action, Congress would have barred most, ifnot all, relief for persons injured by defective medical devices.7 Medtronic's construction of $ 360k would thereforehave the perverse effect of granting complete immunity from
design defect liability to an entire industry that, in the judg-ment of Congress, needed more stringent regulation in order
"to provide for the safety and effectiveness of medical de-vices intended for human use," 90 Stat. 539 (preamble to
Act). It is, to say the least, "difficult to believe that Congress would, without comment, remove all means of judicial
recourse for those injured by illegal conduct," Silkwood v.
Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U. S. 238, 251 (1984), and it would
take language much plainer than the text of $ 360k to convince us that Congress intended that result.

Furthermore, if Congress intended to preclude all
common-law causes of action, it chose a singularly odd word
with which to do it. The statute would have achieved an
identical result, for instance, if it had precluded any "remedy" under state law relating to medical devices. "Requirement" appears to presume that the State is imposing a specific duty upon the manufacturer, and although we have on
prior occasions concluded that a statute pre-empting certain

7 The FDA's authority to require manufacturers to recall, replace, or
refund defective devices is of little use to injured plaintiffs, since there is
no indication that the right is available to private parties, the remedy
would not extend to recovery for compensatory damages, and the authority is rarely invoked, if at all. See Adler, The 1976 Medical Device
Amendments: A Step in the Right Direction Needs Another Step in the
Right Direction, 43 Food Drug Cosm. L. J. 511, 526-527 (1988).

state "requirements" could also pre-empt common-law damages claims, see Cipollone, 505 U. S., at 521-522 (opinion of
Stevens, J.), that statute did not sweep nearly as broadly
as Medtronic would have us believe that this statute does.

The pre-emptive statute in Cipollone 8 was targeted at a
limited set of state requirements--those "based on smoking
and health"--and then only at a limited subset of the possible
applications of those requirements--those involving the "advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of
which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of " the
federal statute. See id., at 515. In that context, giving the
term "requirement" its widest reasonable meaning did not
have nearly the pre-emptive scope nor the effect on potential
remedies that Medtronic's broad reading of the term would
have in this suit. The Court in Cipollone held that the petitioner in that case was able to maintain some common-law
actions using theories of the case that did not run afoul of the
pre-emption statute. See id., at 524-530. Here, however,
Medtronic's sweeping interpretation of the statute would
require far greater interference with state legal remedies,
producing a serious intrusion into state sovereignty while
simultaneously wiping out the possibility of remedy for the

8 There were actually two pre-emptive statutes at issue: The first,
enacted in 1965, provided that "[n]o statement relating to smoking and
health . . . shall be required" on any cigarette package or in any cigarette
advertising. See Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S., at 514. That
provision, the Court concluded, did not pre-empt any of the petitioner's
common-law claims. Id., at 518-520. In 1969, Congress superseded the
1965 pre-emption statute with part of the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, which provided that "[n]o requirement or prohibition
based on smoking and health shall be imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of
which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this Act." Id., at
515. The bulk of Cipollone's analysis involved this later statute; unless
otherwise stated, it is this statute to which we refer in subsequent references to the pre-emptive statute in Cipollone.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Lohrs' alleged injuries.9 Given the ambiguities in the stat-ute and the scope of the preclusion that would occur otherwise, we cannot accept Medtronic's argument that by usingthe term "requirement," Congress clearly signaled its intent
to deprive States of any role in protecting consumers fromthe dangers inherent in many medical devices.

Other differences between this statute and the one in
Cipollone further convince us that when Congress enacted$ 360k, it was primarily concerned with the problem of specific, conflicting state statutes and regulations rather thanthe general duties enforced by common-law actions. Unlike
the statute at issue in Cipollone, $ 360k refers to "require-ments" many times throughout its text. In each instance,
the word is linked with language suggesting that its focus isdevice-specific enactments of positive law by legislative or
administrative bodies, not the application of general rules ofcommon law by judges and juries. For instance, subsections
(a)(2) and (b) of the statute 10 also refer to "requirements"--but those "requirements" refer only to statutory and regulatory law that exists pursuant to the MDA itself, suggestingthat the pre-empted "requirements" established or continued
by States also refer primarily to positive enactments of statelaw. Moreover, in subsection (b) the FDA is given authority
to exclude certain "requirements" from the scope of the pre-emption statute. Of the limited number of "exemptions"

9 Unlike $ 360k, the pre-emptive effect of the statute in Cipollone was
not dependent on the issuance of any agency regulations. The territory
exclusively occupied by federal law was defined in the text of the statute
itself; that text specified the precise warning to smokers that Congress
deemed both necessary and sufficient. In the MDA, no such specifics exist
until the FDA provides them. See also infra, at 495-496 (reliance on the
FDA's interpretation of $ 360k warranted, inter alia, because of the FDA's
role in the administration of $ 360k). Moreover, the statute in Cipollone
was clearly intended to have a broader pre-emptive effect than its 1965
predecessor. See 505 U. S., at 515, 520-521.

from pre-emption that the FDA has granted, none even re-motely resemble common-law claims.

11

An examination of the basic purpose of the legislation aswell as its history entirely supports our rejection of Medtronic's extreme position. The MDA was enacted "to pro-vide for the safety and effectiveness of medical devices intended for human use." 90 Stat. 539. Medtronic assertsthat the Act was also intended, however, to "protect innovations in device technology from being `stifled by unnecessaryrestrictions,' " Brief for Petitioner in No. 95-754, p. 3 (citing
H. R. Rep. No. 94-853, at 12), and that this interest extendedto the pre-emption of common-law claims. While the Act
certainly reflects some of these concerns,12 the legislativehistory indicates that any fears regarding regulatory burdens were related more to the risk of additional federal andstate regulation rather than the danger of pre-existing duties
under common law. See, e. g., 122 Cong. Rec. 5850 (1976)(statement of Rep. Collins) (opposing further "redundant and
burdensome Federal requirements"); id., at 5855 (discussingefforts taken in MDA to protect small businesses from the
additional requirements of the Act). Indeed, nowhere in thematerials relating to the Act's history have we discovered a
reference to a fear that product liability actions would ham-per the development of medical devices. To the extent that
Congress was concerned about protecting the industry, thatintent was manifested primarily through fewer substantive
requirements under the Act, not the pre-emption provision;furthermore, any such concern was far outweighed by con11 All 22 exemptions at 21 CFR $$ 808.53-808.101 (1995) are exemptions
for state statutes and regulations regarding the sale of hearing aids.

12 Special statutory exemptions, for example, permit the FDA (with various oversight provisions) to allow investigative, experimental devices to
be used in commerce without either PMA review or "substantial equivalence." See 21 U. S. C. $ 360j(g); 21 CFR pt. 813 (1995). Moreover, the
very existence of the pre-emption statute demonstrates some concern that
competing state requirements may unduly interfere with the market for
medical devices.

cerns about the primary issue motivating the MDA's enactment: the safety of those who use medical devices.

The legislative history also confirms our understanding
that $ 360(k) simply was not intended to pre-empt most, let
alone all, general common-law duties enforced by damages
actions. There is, to the best of our knowledge, nothing in
the hearings, the Committee Reports, or the debates suggesting that any proponent of the legislation intended a
sweeping pre-emption of traditional common-law remedies
against manufacturers and distributors of defective devices.
If Congress intended such a result, its failure even to hint
at it is spectacularly odd, particularly since Members of
both Houses were acutely aware of ongoing product liability
litigation.13 Along with the less-than-precise language of

$ 360k(a), that silence surely indicates that at least some
common-law claims against medical device manufacturers
may be maintained after the enactment of the MDA.

13 Furthermore, if Congress had intended the MDA to work this dramatic change in the availability of state-law remedies, one would expect
some reference to that change in the extensive contemporary reviews of
the legislation. We have been able to find no such reference. See, e. g.,
Lesparre, Industry Spokesman Comments on Medical Device Amendments of 1976, 50 Hospitals 99, 103 (Sept. 16, 1976); A. Levine, Device
Failure and the Plaintiff's Lawyer, in Proceedings of the Second Annual

Opinion of the Court

V
Medtronic asserts several specific reasons why, even if$ 360k does not pre-empt all common-law claims, it at least

pre-empts the Lohrs' claims in this suit. In contrast, theLohrs argue that their entire complaint should survive a reasonable evaluation of the pre-emptive scope of $ 360k(a).First, the Lohrs claim that the Court of Appeals correctly
held that their negligent design claims were not pre-emptedbecause the $ 510(k) premarket notification process imposes
no "requirement" on the design of Medtronic's pacemaker.Second, they suggest that even if the FDA's general rules
regulating manufacturing practices and labeling are "re-quirements" that pre-empt different state requirements,

$ 360k(a) does not pre-empt state rules that merely duplicatesome or all of those federal requirements. Finally, they
argue that because the State's general rules imposingcommon-law duties upon Medtronic do not impose a requirement "with respect to a device," they do not conflict with theFDA's general rules relating to manufacturing and labeling
and are therefore not pre-empted.
Design Claim

The Court of Appeals concluded that the Lohrs' defec-tive design claims were not pre-empted because the requirements with which the company had to comply were notsufficiently concrete to constitute a pre-empting federal requirement. Medtronic counters by pointing to the FDA'sdetermination that Model 4011 is "substantially equivalent"
to an earlier device as well as the agency's continuing author-ity to exclude the device from the market if its design is
changed. These factors, Medtronic argues, amount to a spe-cific, federally enforceable design requirement that cannot
be affected by state-law pressures such as those imposed onmanufacturers subject to product liability suits.

The company's defense exaggerates the importance of the$ 510(k) process and the FDA letter to the company regard518us2$83I 05-18-99 18:58:29 PAGES OPINPGT

493Cite as: 518 U. S. 470 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
ing the pacemaker's substantial equivalence to a grand-fathered device. As the court below noted, "[t]he 510(k)

process is focused on equivalence, not safety." 56 F. 3d, at1348. As a result, "substantial equivalence determinations
provide little protection to the public. These determinations simply compare a post-1976 device to a pre-1976 deviceto ascertain whether the later device is no more dangerous

and no less effective than the earlier device. If the earlierdevice poses a severe risk or is ineffective, then the later
device may also be risky or ineffective." Adler, 43 FoodDrug Cosm. L. J., at 516. The design of the Model 4011, as
with the design of pre-1976 and other "substantially equivalent" devices, has never been formally reviewed under the
MDA for safety or efficacy.

The FDA stressed this basic conclusion in its letter to
Medtronic finding the 4011 lead "substantially equivalent" to
devices already on the market. That letter only required
Medtronic to comply with "general standards"--the lowest
level of protection "applicable to all medical devices," and
including "listing of devices, good manufacturing practices,
labeling, and the misbranding and adulteration provisions of
the Act." It explicitly warned Medtronic that the letter did
"not in any way denote official FDA approval of your device," and that "[a]ny representation that creates an impression of official approval of this device because of compliance
with the premarket notification regulations is misleading and
constitutes misbranding." FDA Substantial Equivalence
Letter.

Thus, even though the FDA may well examine $ 510(k)
applications for Class III devices (as it examines the entire
medical device industry) with a concern for the safety and
effectiveness of the device, see Brief for Petitioner in
No. 95-754, at 22-26, it did not "require" Medtronics' pacemaker to take any particular form for any particular reason;
the agency simply allowed the pacemaker, as a device substantially equivalent to one that existed before 1976, to be

marketed without running the gauntlet of the PMA process.In providing for this exemption to PMA review, Congress

intended merely to give manufacturers the freedom to com-pete, to a limited degree, with and on the same terms as
manufacturers of medical devices that existed prior to 1976.14There is no suggestion in either the statutory scheme or
the legislative history that the $ 510(k) exemption processwas intended to do anything other than maintain the status
quo with respect to the marketing of existing medical de-vices and their substantial equivalents. That status quo
included the possibility that the manufacturer of the devicewould have to defend itself against state-law claims of negligent design. Given this background behind the "substantialequivalence" exemption, the fact that "[t]he purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone" in every pre-emptioncase, 505 U. S., at 516 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), and the presumption against pre-emption, theCourt of Appeals properly concluded that the "substantial

The Lohrs next suggest that even if "requirements" existwith respect to the manufacturing and labeling of the pace14 As the FDA Commissioner put it in 1982: "[T]he 510(k) provision of
the law is a procompetition mechanism that permits firms to make and
quickly market me-too versions of pre-1976 devices. The Congress apparently believed that a firm whose device happened to be on the market
before enactment of the amendments and was never subject to preclearance by FDA should not enjoy a lengthy monopoly at the expense of other
firms and ultimately the consumer." FDA Oversight: Medical Devices,

maker, and even if we can also consider state law to imposea "requirement" under the Act, the state requirement is not

pre-empted unless it is "different from, or in addition to,"the federal requirement. $ 360k(a)(1). Although the precise contours of their theory of recovery have not yet been
defined (the pre-emption issue was decided on the basis ofthe pleadings), it is clear that the Lohrs' allegations may include claims that Medtronic has, to the extent that theyexist, violated FDA regulations. At least these claims, they
suggest, can be maintained without being pre-empted by$ 360k, and we agree.

Nothing in $ 360k denies Florida the right to provide a
traditional damages remedy for violations of common-law duties when those duties parallel federal requirements. Even
if it may be necessary as a matter of Florida law to prove
that those violations were the result of negligent conduct,
or that they created an unreasonable hazard for users of
the product, such additional elements of the state-law cause
of action would make the state requirements narrower, not
broader, than the federal requirement. While such a narrower requirement might be "different from" the federal
rules in a literal sense, such a difference would surely provide a strange reason for finding pre-emption of a state rule
insofar as it duplicates the federal rule. The presence of
a damages remedy does not amount to the additional or different "requirement" that is necessary under the statute;
rather, it merely provides another reason for manufacturers
to comply with identical existing "requirements" under federal law.

The FDA regulations interpreting the scope of $ 360k's
pre-emptive effect support the Lohrs' view, and our interpretation of the pre-emption statute is substantially informed
by those regulations. The different views expressed by the
Courts of Appeals regarding the appropriate scope of federal
pre-emption under $ 360k demonstrate that the language of
that section is not entirely clear. In addition, Congress has

Opinion of the Court
given the FDA a unique role in determining the scope of$ 360k's pre-emptive effect. Unlike the statute construed in

Cipollone, for instance, pre-emption under the MDA doesnot arise directly as a result of the enactment of the statute;
rather, in most cases a state law will be pre-empted only to
the extent that the FDA has promulgated a relevant federal"requirement." Because the FDA is the federal agency to

which Congress has delegated its authority to implement theprovisions of the Act,

15 the agency is uniquely qualified to

determine whether a particular form of state law "standsas an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the

full purposes and objectives of Congress," Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941), and, therefore, whether it should
be pre-empted. For example, Congress explicitly delegatedto the FDA the authority to exempt state regulations from

the pre-emptive effect of the MDA--an authority that necessarily requires the FDA to assess the pre-emptive effect that
the Act and its own regulations will have on state laws. See

$ 360k(b). FDA regulations implementing that grant of authority establish a process by which States or other individuals may request an advisory opinion from the FDA regarding whether a particular state requirement is pre-empted by
the statute. See 21 CFR $ 808.5 (1995). The ambiguity in
the statute--and the congressional grant of authority to the
agency on the matter contained within it--provide a "sound
basis," post, at 509 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part), for giving substantial weight to the
agency's view of the statute. See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v.
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984);
Hillsborough Cty., 471 U. S., at 714 (considering FDA understanding of pre-emptive effect of its regulations "dispositive").

The regulations promulgated by the FDA expressly support the conclusion that $ 360k "does not preempt State or
local requirements that are equal to, or substantially identi15 See n. 5, supra; 21 U. S. C. $ 371(a).

cal to, requirements imposed by or under the act." 21 CFR$ 808.1(d)(2) (1995); see also $ 808.5(b)(1)(i).

16 At this early

stage in the litigation, there was no reason for the Court ofAppeals to preclude altogether the Lohrs' manufacturing

and labeling claims to the extent that they rest on claimsthat Medtronic negligently failed to comply with duties
"equal to, or substantially identical to, requirements im-posed" under federal law.

Manufacturing and Labeling Claims

Finally, the Lohrs suggest that with respect to the manu-facturing and labeling claims, the Court of Appeals should

have rejected Medtronic's pre-emption defense in full. TheCourt of Appeals believed that these claims would interfere
with the consistent application of general federal regulationsgoverning the labeling and manufacture of all medical devices, and therefore concluded that the claims were pre-empted altogether.

The requirements identified by the Court of Appeals in-clude labeling regulations that require manufacturers of
every medical device, with a few limited exceptions, to in-clude with the device a label containing "information for
use, . . . and any relevant hazards, contraindications, side ef-fects, and precautions." 21 CFR $$ 801.109(b) and (c) (1995).
Similarly, manufacturers are required to comply with "GoodManufacturing Practices," or "GMP's," which are set forth
in 32 sections and less than 10 pages in the Code of FederalRegulations.

17 In certain circumstances, the Court of Ap16 We also note that the agency permits manufacturers of devices that
have received PMA to make certain labeling, quality control, and manufacturing changes which would "enhanc[e] the safety of the device or the
safety in the use of the device" without prior FDA approval. See 21 CFR

$$ 814.39(d)(1) and (2) (1995).

17 Some GMP's include the duty to institute a "quality assurance program," $ 820.5, to have an "adequate organizational structure," $ 820.20,
to ensure that personnel in contact with a device are "clean, healthy, and
suitably attired" where such matters are relevant to the device's safety,

Opinion of the Court
peals recognized, the FDA will enforce these general re-quirements against manufacturers that violate them. See

56 F. 3d, at 1350-1351.While admitting that these requirements exist, the Lohrs
suggest that their general nature simply does not pre-emptclaims alleging that the manufacturer failed to comply with
other duties under state common law. In support of theirclaim, they note that $ 360k(a)(1) expressly states that a federal requirement must be "applicable to the device" in ques-tion before it has any pre-emptive effect. Because the labeling and manufacturing requirements are applicable to a hostof different devices, they argue that they do not satisfy this
condition. They further argue that because only state re-quirements "with respect to a device" may be pre-empted,
and then only if the requirement "relates to the safety oreffectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in
a requirement applicable to the device," $ 360k(a) mandatespre-emption only where there is a conflict between a specific
state requirement and a federal requirement "applicable to"
the same device.The Lohrs' theory is supported by the FDA regulations,

which provide that state requirements are pre-empted"only" when the FDA has established "specific counterpart
regulations or . . . other specific requirements applicable to aparticular device." 21 CFR $ 808.1(d) (1995).

18 FDA's narrow understanding of the scope of $ 360k(a) is obvious from

the full text of the regulation, which provides, in relevant part:

"(d) State or local requirements are preempted only when the Food and
Drug Administration has established specific counterpart regulations or
there are other specific requirements applicable to a particular device
under the act, thereby making any existing divergent State or local requirements applicable to the device different from, or in addition to, the
specific Food and Drug Administration requirements. There are other
State or local requirements that affect devices that are not preempted by

ther note that the statute is not intended to pre-empt "Stateor local requirements of general applicability where the purpose of the requirement relates either to other products inaddition to devices . . . or to unfair trade practices in which
the requirements are not limited to devices." $ 808.1(d)(1).The regulations specifically provide, as examples of permissible general requirements, that general electrical codes andthe Uniform Commercial Code warranty of fitness would not
be pre-empted. See ibid. The regulations even go so faras to state that $ 360k(a) generally "does not preempt a state
or local requirement prohibiting the manufacture of adul-terated or misbranded devices" unless "such a prohibition
has the effect of establishing a substantive requirement fora specific device." $ 808.1(d)(6)(ii). Furthermore, under its
authority to grant exemptions to the pre-emptive effect of$ 360k(a), the FDA has never granted, nor, to the best of our

section 521(a) of the act because they are not `requirements applicable to
a device' within the meaning of section 521(a) of the act. The following
are examples of State or local requirements that are not regarded as preempted by section 521 of the act:

"(1) Section 521(a) does not preempt State or local requirements of general applicability where the purpose of the requirement relates either to
other products in addition to devices (e. g., requirements such as general
electrical codes, and the Uniform Commercial Code (warranty of fitness)),
or to unfair trade practices in which the requirements are not limited
to devices.

knowledge, even been asked to consider granting, an ex-emption for a state law of general applicability; all 22

existing exemptions apply to excruciatingly specific staterequirements regarding the sale of hearing aids. See

$$ 808.53-808.101.Although we do not believe that this statutory and regulatory language necessarily precludes "general" federal re-quirements from ever pre-empting state requirements, or
"general" state requirements from ever being pre-empted,see Part VI,

infra, it is impossible to ignore its overarchingconcern that pre-emption occur only where a particular state

requirement threatens to interfere with a specific federal in-terest. State requirements must be "with respect to" medical devices and "different from, or in addition to," federalrequirements. State requirements must also relate "to the
safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matterincluded in a requirement applicable to the device," and the
regulations provide that state requirements of "general ap-plicability" are not pre-empted except where they have "the
effect of establishing a substantive requirement for a specificdevice." Moreover, federal requirements must be "applicable to the device" in question, and, according to the regula-tions, pre-empt state law only if they are "specific counterpart regulations" or "specific" to a "particular device." Thestatute and regulations, therefore, require a careful comparison between the allegedly pre-empting federal requirementand the allegedly pre-empted state requirement to determine whether they fall within the intended pre-emptivescope of the statute and regulations.

19 A plurality of this Court concluded in Cipollone that a similar analysis
was required under the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969.
That Act pre-empted requirements and prohibitions based on smoking and
health "imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion" of cigarettes in packages that were labeled in conformity with that
Act. 505 U. S., at 515. We held that the petitioner's fraudulent misrepresentation claims, including those based on allegedly false statements made
in advertisements, were not pre-empted because they were "predicated
not on a duty `based on smoking and health' but rather on a more general

501Cite as: 518 U. S. 470 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
Such a comparison mandates a conclusion that the Lohrs'common-law claims are not pre-empted by the federal labeling and manufacturing requirements. The generality ofthose requirements make this quite unlike a case in which
the Federal Government has weighed the competing inter-ests relevant to the particular requirement in question,
reached an unambiguous conclusion about how those compet-ing considerations should be resolved in a particular case or
set of cases, and implemented that conclusion via a specificmandate on manufacturers or producers. Rather, the federal requirements reflect important but entirely generic con-cerns about device regulation generally, not the sort of concerns regarding a specific device or field of device regulationthat the statute or regulations were designed to protect from
potentially contradictory state requirements.Similarly, the general state common-law requirements in
this suit were not specifically developed "with respect to"medical devices. Accordingly, they are not the kinds of requirements that Congress and the FDA feared would impedethe ability of federal regulators to implement and enforce
specific federal requirements. The legal duty that is thepredicate for the Lohrs' negligent manufacturing claim is the
general duty of every manufacturer to use due care to avoidforeseeable dangers in its products. Similarly, the predicate
for the failure to warn claim is the general duty to informusers and purchasers of potentially dangerous items of the
risks involved in their use. These general obligations areno more a threat to federal requirements than would be a
state-law duty to comply with local fire prevention regulaobligation--the duty not to deceive." Id., at 528-529. The general
common-law duty "not to make fraudulent statements" was not within the
specific category of requirements or prohibitions based on smoking and
health imposed under state law "with respect to the advertising or promotion" of cigarettes that were pre-empted by the 1969 statute. Id., at 529.

If anything, the language of the MDA's pre-emption statute and its counterpart regulations require an even more searching inquiry into the relationship between the federal requirement and the state requirement at
issue than was true under the statute in Cipollone.

tions and zoning codes, or to use due care in the trainingand supervision of a work force. These state requirements

therefore escape pre-emption, not because the source of theduty is a judge-made common-law rule, but rather because
their generality leaves them outside the category of require-ments that $ 360k envisioned to be "with respect to" specific
devices such as pacemakers. As a result, none of the Lohrs'claims based on allegedly defective manufacturing or labeling are pre-empted by the MDA.

VI
In their cross-petition, the Lohrs present a final argument,suggesting that common-law duties are never "requirements" within the meaning of $ 360k and that the statutetherefore never pre-empts common-law actions. The Lohrs
point out that our holding in Cipollone is not dispositive ofthis issue, for as Part IV,

supra, suggests, there are signifi-cant textual and historical differences between the Cipollone

statute and $ 360k, and the meaning of words must always beinformed by the environment within which they are situated.
We do not think that the issue is resolved by the FDA regu-lation suggesting that $ 360k is applicable to those requirements "having the force and effect of law" that are "estab-lished by . . . court decision," 21 CFR $ 808.1(b) (1995); that
reference, it appears, was intended to refer to court decisions
construing state statutes or regulations. See 42 Fed. Reg.30383, 30385 (1977); Brief for Petitioners in No. 95-886,

p. 26, n. 7.Nevertheless, we do not respond directly to this argument
for two reasons. First, since none of the Lohrs' claims ispre-empted in this suit, we need not resolve hypothetical
cases that may arise in the future. Second, given the criti-cal importance of device specificity in our (and the FDA's)
construction of $ 360k, it is apparent that few, if any,common-law duties have been pre-empted by this statute.
It will be rare indeed for a court hearing a common-law

cause of action to issue a decree that has "the effect of establishing a substantive requirement for a specific device." 21
CFR $ 808.1(d)(6)(ii) (1995). Until such a case arises, we see
no need to determine whether the statute explicitly preempts such a claim. Even then, the issue may not need to be
resolved if the claim would also be pre-empted under conflict
pre-emption analysis, see Freightliner Corp. v. Myrick, 514
U. S. 280, 287 (1995).

VII

Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed insofar as it held that any of the claims were preempted and affirmed insofar as it rejected the pre-emption
defense. The cases are remanded for further proceedings.

It is so ordered.

Justice Breyer, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.

This action raises two questions. First, do the Medical
Device Amendments of 1976 (MDA) to the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act ever pre-empt a state-law tort action? Second, if so, does the MDA pre-empt the particular
state-law tort claims at issue here?

I
My answer to the first question is that the MDA will sometimes pre-empt a state-law tort suit. I basically agree with
Justice O'Connor's discussion of this point and with her
conclusion. See post, at 510-512. The statute's language,
read literally, supports that conclusion. It says:

"[N]o State . . . may establish . . . with respect to a
device . . . any [state] requirement . . . which is different
from, or in addition to, any [federal] requirement . . . ."
21 U. S. C. $ 360k(a) (emphasis added).

518us2$83Q 05-18-99 18:58:29 PAGES OPINPGT
504 MEDTRONIC, INC. v. LOHR

Opinion of Breyer, J.
One can reasonably read the word "requirement" as includ-ing the legal requirements that grow out of the application,

in particular circumstances, of a State's tort law.Moreover, in

Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U. S.
504 (1992), the Court made clear that similar language "easily" encompassed tort actions because "[state] regulation canbe as effectively exerted through an award of damages as

through some form of preventive relief." Id., at 521 (plural-ity opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted); see

id., at
548-549 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dis-senting in part). Accord,

CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood,
507 U. S. 658, 664 (1993). This rationale would seem applicable to the quite similar circumstances at issue here.

Finally, a contrary holding would have anomalous consequences. Imagine that, in respect to a particular hearing
aid component, a federal MDA regulation requires a 2-inch
wire, but a state agency regulation requires a 1-inch wire.
If the federal law, embodied in the "2-inch" MDA regulation,
pre-empts the state "1-inch" agency regulation, why would it
not similarly pre-empt a state-law tort action that premises
liability upon the defendant manufacturer's failure to use a
1-inch wire (say, an award by a jury persuaded by expert
testimony that use of a more than 1-inch wire is negligent)?
The effects of the state agency regulation and the state tort
suit are identical. To distinguish between them for preemption purposes would grant greater power (to set state
standards "different from, or in addition to," federal standards) to a single state jury than to state officials acting
through state administrative or legislative lawmaking processes. Where Congress likely did not focus specifically upon
the matter, see ante, at 486-491, I would not take it to have
intended this anomalous result.

Consequently, I believe that ordinarily, insofar as the MDA
pre-empts a state requirement embodied in a state statute,
rule, regulation, or other administrative action, it would also
pre-empt a similar requirement that takes the form of a

505Cite as: 518 U. S. 470 (1996)
Opinion of Breyer, J.
standard of care or behavior imposed by a state-law tortaction. It is possible that the plurality also agrees on this

point, although it does not say so explicitly.

II
The answer to the second question turns on Congress' in-tent. See,

e. g., Barnett Bank of Marion Cty., N. A. v. Nel-son, 517 U. S. 25, 30 (1996); Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck,

471 U. S. 202, 208 (1985); ante, at 485-486. Although Con-gress has not stated whether the MDA does, or does not,
pre-empt the tort claims here at issue, several considerationslead me to conclude that it does not.

First, the MDA's pre-emption provision is highly ambigu-ous. That provision makes clear that federal requirements
may pre-empt state requirements, but it says next to nothingabout just when, where, or how they may do so. The words
"any [state] requirement" and "any [federal] requirement,"for example, do not tell us which requirements are at issue,
for every state requirement that is not identical to even onefederal requirement is "different from, or in addition to,"
that single federal requirement; yet, Congress could not haveintended that the existence of one single federal rule, say,
about a 2-inch hearing aid wire, would pre-empt every statelaw hearing aid rule, even a set of rules related only to the
packaging or shipping of hearing aids. Thus, Congress musthave intended that courts look elsewhere for help as to just
which federal requirements pre-empt just which state re-quirements, as well as just how they might do so.

Second, this Court has previously suggested that, in theabsence of a clear congressional command as to pre-emption,
courts may infer that the relevant administrative agencypossesses a degree of leeway to determine which rules, regulations, or other administrative actions will have pre-emptiveeffect. See Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical
Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 721 (1985); cf. Smiley v.Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 739-741

No. 40-1, 469 U. S. 256, 261-262 (1985); Chevron U. S. A. Inc.
v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837,842-845 (1984). To draw a similar inference here makes

sense, and not simply because of the statutory ambiguity.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is fully respon-sible for administering the MDA. See 21 U. S. C. $ 393.

That responsibility means informed agency involvement and,therefore, special understanding of the likely impact of both
state and federal requirements, as well as an understandingof whether (or the extent to which) state requirements may
interfere with federal objectives. See Hillsborough, 471U. S., at 721. The FDA can translate these understandings
into particularized pre-emptive intentions accompanying its
various rules and regulations. See id., at 718. It can com-municate those intentions, for example, through statements

in "regulations, preambles, interpretive statements, and re-sponses to comments,"

ibid., as well as through the exercise
of its explicitly designated power to exempt state require-ments from pre-emption, see 21 U. S. C. $ 360k(b); see also

ante, at 496 (noting that FDA's authority to exempt staterequirements from pre-emption necessarily requires FDA to
assess federal laws' pre-emptive effect).

Third, the FDA has promulgated a specific regulationdesigned to help. That regulation says:

"State . . . requirements are preempted only when . . .
there are . . . specific [federal] requirements applicable
to a particular device . . . thereby making any existing
divergent State . . . requirements applicable to the device different from, or in addition to, the specific [federal] requirements." 21 CFR $ 808.1(d) (1995) (emphasis added).

The regulation does not fill all the statutory gaps, for its
word "divergent" does not explain, any more than did the
statute, just when different device-related federal and state

507Cite as: 518 U. S. 470 (1996)
Opinion of Breyer, J.
requirements are closely enough related to trigger pre-emption analysis. But the regulation's word "specific" does

narrow the universe of federal requirements that the agencyintends to displace at least some state law.

Insofar as there are any applicable FDA requirements
here, those requirements, even if numerous, are not "spe-cific" in any relevant sense. See

ante, at 497-498, 501.
Hence, as the FDA's above-quoted pre-emption rule tells us,the FDA does not intend these requirements to pre-empt

the state requirements at issue here. At least in presentcircumstances, no law forces the FDA to make its requirements pre-emptive if it does not think it appropriate.

I cannot infer a contrary intent from Justice O'Connor's
characterization of the federal standards applicable here as
"comprehensive" and "extensive," post, at 513, 514, both because that characterization is questionable, see ante, at 497-
498, 501, and because this Court has previously said that it
would "seldom infer, solely from the comprehensiveness of
federal regulations, an intent to pre-empt in its entirety a
field related to health and safety." Hillsborough, supra, at
718. It therefore seems to me that the better indicator of
the FDA's intent is its pre-emption-related regulation. And
that regulation's word "specific" would seem a reasonable
exercise of the leeway that statutory language and practical
administrative circumstance suggest Congress intended to
grant to the agency.

Fourth, ordinary principles of "conflict" and "field" preemption point in the same direction. Those principles make
clear that a federal requirement pre-empts a state requirement if (1) the state requirement actually conflicts with the
federal requirement--either because compliance with both
is impossible, Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v.
Paul, 373 U. S. 132, 142-143 (1963), or because the state requirement "stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and
execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,"
Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941)--or (2) the

It makes sense, in the absence of any indication of a contrary congressional (or agency) intent, to read the preemption statute (and the pre-emption regulation) in light of
these basic pre-emption principles. The statutory terms
"different from" and "in addition to" readily lend themselves
to such a reading, for their language parallels pre-emption
law's basic concerns. Without any contrary indication from
the agency, one might also interpret the regulation's word
"divergent" in light of these same basic pre-empti on
principles.

Insofar as these basic principles inform a court's interpretation of the statute and regulation, they support the conclusion that there is no pre-emption here. I can find no actual
conflict between any federal requirement and any of the
liability-creating premises of the plaintiffs' state-law tort
suit; nor, for the reasons discussed above, can I find any
indication that either Congress or the FDA intended the
relevant FDA regulations to occupy entirely any relevant
field.

For these reasons, I concur in the Court's judgment. I
also join the Court's opinion, but for Parts IV and VI. I do
not join Part IV, which emphasizes the differences between
the MDA and the pre-emption statute at issue in Cipollone,
because those differences are not, in my view, relevant in
this action. I do not join Part VI, because I am not
convinced that future incidents of MDA pre-emption of
common-law claims will be "few" or "rare," ante, at 502.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justice,
Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas join, concurring inpart and dissenting in part.

Section 360k(a), the pre-emption provision of the MedicalDevice Amendments of 1976 (MDA), provides that no State
may establish or continue in effect "any requirement" "whichis different from, or in addition to," any requirement applicable under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938(FDCA) to the device. As the Court points out, because
Congress has expressly provided a pre-emption provision,"we need not go beyond that language to determine whether
Congress intended the MDA to pre-empt" state law. Ante,at 484. We agree, then, on the task before us: to interpret
Congress' intent by reading the statute in accordance with
its terms. This, however, the Court has failed to do.The cases require us to determine whether the Lohrs'

state common-law claims survive pre-emption under $ 360k.I conclude that state common-law damages actions do impose "requirements" and are therefore pre-empted wheresuch requirements would differ from those imposed by the
FDCA. The plurality acknowledges that a common-law ac-tion might impose a "requirement," but suggests that such a
pre-emption would be "rare indeed." Ante, at 502. To
reach that determination, the opinion--without explicitly re-lying on Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations

and without offering any sound basis for why deferencewould be warranted--imports the FDA regulations interpreting $ 360k to "inform" the Court's reading. Accordingly,the principal opinion states that pre-emption occurs only
"where a particular state requirement threatens to interferewith a specific federal interest,"

ante, at 500, and for that
reason, concludes that common-law claims are almost never
pre-empted, ante, at 502-503, and that the Lohrs' claims hereare not pre-empted. This decision is bewildering and seemingly without guiding principle.

510 MEDTRONIC, INC. v. LOHR

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
The language of $ 360k demonstrates congressional intentthat the MDA pre-empt "any requirement" by a State that

is "different from, or in addition to," that applicable to thedevice under the FDCA. The Lohrs have raised various
state common-law claims in connection with Medtronic's
pacemaker lead. Analysis, therefore, must begin with thequestion whether state common-law actions can constitute

"requirements" within the meaning of $ 360k(a).We recently addressed a similar question in

Cipollone,
where we examined the meaning of the phrase "no require-ment or prohibition" under the Public Health Cigarette

Smoking Act of 1969. Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505U. S. 504 (1992). A majority of the Court agreed that state
common-law damages actions do impose "requirements."
Id., at 521-522 (plurality opinion); id., at 548-549 (Scalia, J.,joined by

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and
dissenting in part). As the plurality explained:

"The phrase, `[n]o requirement or prohibition' sweeps
broadly and suggests no distinction between positive en-actments and common law; to the contrary, those words

easily encompass obligations that take the form ofcommon-law rules. As we noted in another context,
`[state] regulation can be as effectively exerted throughan award of damages as through some form of preventive relief. The obligation to pay compensation can be,indeed is designed to be, a potent method of governing
conduct and controlling policy.' San Diego Building
Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236, 247 (1959)."
Id., at 521.

That rationale is equally applicable in the present context.
Whether relating to the labeling of cigarettes or the manufacture of medical devices, state common-law damages
actions operate to require manufacturers to comply with
common-law duties. As Cipollone declared, in answer to
the same argument raised here that common-law actions

511Cite as: 518 U. S. 470 (1996)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
do not impose requirements, "such an analysis is at oddsboth with the plain words" of the statute and "with the general understanding of common-law damages actions." Ibid.If $ 360k's language is given its ordinary meaning, it clearly
pre-empts any state common-law action that would impose
a requirement different from, or in addition to, that appli-cable under the FDCA--just as it would pre-empt a state

statute or regulation that had that effect. Justice Breyerreaches the same conclusion.

Ante, at 503-505 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).The plurality's reasons for departing from this reading are

neither clear nor persuasive. It fails to refute the applicability of the reasoning of Cipollone. Instead, in Part IV,
the plurality essentially makes the case that the statute's
language, purpose, and legislative history, as well as the consequences of a different interpretation, indicate that Congress did not intend "requirement" to include state commonlaw claims at all. The principal opinion proceeds to disclaim
this position, however, in Parts V and VI and concludes,
rather, that a state common-law action might constitute a
requirement, but that such a case would be "rare indeed."
Ante, at 502. The Court holds that an FDCA "requirement"
triggers pre-emption only when a conflict exists between a
specific state requirement and a specific FDCA requirement
applicable to the particular device. See ante, at 498-502.
But see ante, at 500 ("[W]e do not believe that this statutory
and regulatory language necessarily precludes `general' federal requirements from ever pre-empting state requirements, or `general' state requirements from ever being

pre-empted . . ."). The plurality emphasizes the "critical
importance of device specificity" in its understanding of

the pre-emption scheme. Ante, at 502.

To reach its particularized reading of the statute, the
Court imports the interpretation put forth by the FDA's
regulations. Justice Breyer similarly relies on the FDA
regulations to arrive at an understanding of $ 360(k). Ante,

512 MEDTRONIC, INC. v. LOHR

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
at 505-507. Apparently recognizing that Chevron deference
is unwarranted here, the Court does not admit to deferring
to these regulations, but merely permits them to "infor[m]"
the Court's interpretation. Ante, at 495. It is not certain
that an agency regulation determining the pre-emptive effect of any federal statute is entitled to deference, cf. Smiley
v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735, 743-744
(1996), but one pertaining to the clear statute at issue here is
surely not. "If the statute contains an express pre-emption
clause, the task of statutory construction must in the first
instance focus on the plain wording of the clause, which necessarily contains the best evidence of Congress' pre-emptive
intent." CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood, 507 U. S. 658, 664
(1993). Where the language of the statute is clear, resort
to the agency's interpretation is improper. See Chevron
U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467
U. S. 837, 842-843 (1984). Title 21 U. S. C. $ 360k(a)(1) directs the pre-emption of "any [state] requirement" "which is
different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable
under [the FDCA] to the device." As explained above, and
as Justice Breyer agrees, ante, at 503-505, the term "requirement" encompasses state common-law causes of action.
The Court errs when it employs an agency's narrowing construction of a statute where no such deference is warranted.
The statute makes no mention of a requirement of specificity,
and there is no sound basis for determining that such a restriction on "any requirement" exists.

I conclude that a fair reading of $ 360k indicates that state
common-law claims are pre-empted, as the statute itself
states, to the extent that their recognition would impose
"any requirement" different from, or in addition to, FDCA
requirements applicable to the device. From that premise,
I proceed to the question whether FDCA requirements
applicable to the device exist here to pre-empt the Lohrs'
state-law claims.

513Cite as: 518 U. S. 470 (1996)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
I agree with the Court that the Lohrs' defective design
claim is not pre-empted by the FDCA's $ 510(k) "substantial
equivalency" process. The $ 510(k) process merely evaluates whether the Class III device at issue is substantially
equivalent to a device that was on the market before 1976,
the effective date of the MDA; if so, the later device may
be also be marketed. Because the $ 510(k) process seeks
merely to establish whether a pre-1976 device and a post1976 device are equivalent, and places no "requirements" on
a device, the Lohrs' defective design claim is not pre-empted.

I also agree that the Lohrs' claims are not pre-empted by

$ 360k to the extent that they seek damages for Medtronic's
alleged violation of federal requirements. Where a state
cause of action seeks to enforce an FDCA requirement, that
claim does not impose a requirement that is "different from,
or in addition to," requirements under federal law. To be
sure, the threat of a damages remedy will give manufacturers an additional cause to comply, but the requirements imposed on them under state and federal law do not differ.
Section 360k does not preclude States from imposing different or additional remedies, but only different or additional
requirements.

I disagree, however, with the Court's conclusion that the
Lohrs' claims survive pre-emption insofar as they would
compel Medtronic to comply with requirements different
from those imposed by the FDCA. Because I do not subscribe to the Court's reading into $ 360k the additional requisite of "specificity," my determination of what claims
are pre-empted is broader. Some, if not all, of the Lohrs'
common-law claims regarding the manufacturing and labeling of Medtronic's device would compel Medtronic to comply
with requirements different from, or in addition to, those required by the FDA. The FDA's Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations impose comprehensive requirements
relating to every aspect of the device-manufacturing process,

518us2$83J 05-18-99 18:58:29 PAGES OPINPGT
514 MEDTRONIC, INC. v. LOHR

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
including a manufacturer's organization and personnel, build-ings, equipment, component controls, production and process

controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding, distribu-tion, installation, device evaluation, and recordkeeping. See
21 CFR $$ 820.20-820.198 (1995). The Lohrs' common-lawclaims regarding manufacture would, if successful, impose
state requirements "different from, or in addition to," theGMP requirements, and are therefore pre-empted. In similar fashion, the Lohrs' failure to warn claim is pre-emptedby the extensive labeling requirements imposed by the FDA.
See, e. g., 21 CFR $ 801.109 (1995) (requiring labels to includesuch information as indications, effects, routes, methods, frequency and duration of administration, relevant hazards, con-traindications, side effects, and precautions). These extensive federal manufacturing and labeling requirements arecertainly applicable to the device manufactured by Medtronic. Section 360k(a) requires no more specificity thanthat for pre-emption of state common-law claims.

To summarize, I conclude that $ 360k(a)'s term "require-ment" encompasses state common-law claims. Because the
statutory language does not indicate that a "requirement"must be "specific," either to pre-empt or be pre-empted, I
conclude that a state common-law claim is pre-empted if itwould impose "any requirement" "which is different from, or
in addition to," any requirement applicable to the deviceunder the FDCA. I would affirm the judgment of the Court
of Appeals that the Lohrs' design claim is not pre-empted bythe MDA, and that the manufacture and failure to warn
claims are pre-empted; I would reverse the judgment of theCourt of Appeals that the MDA pre-empts a common-law
claim alleging violation of federal requirements.

UNITED STATES v. VIRGINIA et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 94-1941. Argued January 17, 1996--Decided June 26, 1996*
Virginia Military Institute (VMI) is the sole single-sex school among Virginia's public institutions of higher learning. VMI's distinctive mission
is to produce "citizen-soldiers," men prepared for leadership in civilian
life and in military service. Using an "adversative method" of training
not available elsewhere in Virginia, VMI endeavors to instill physical
and mental discipline in its cadets and impart to them a strong moral
code. Reflecting the high value alumni place on their VMI training,
VMI has the largest per-student endowment of all public undergraduate
institutions in the Nation. The United States sued Virginia and VMI,
alleging that VMI's exclusively male admission policy violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The District Court
ruled in VMI's favor. The Fourth Circuit reversed and ordered Virginia to remedy the constitutional violation. In response, Virginia proposed a parallel program for women: Virginia Women's Institute for
Leadership (VWIL), located at Mary Baldwin College, a private liberal
arts school for women. The District Court found that Virginia's proposal satisfied the Constitution's equal protection requirement, and the
Fourth Circuit affirmed. The appeals court deferentially reviewed Virginia's plan and determined that provision of single-gender educational
options was a legitimate objective. Maintenance of single-sex programs, the court concluded, was essential to that objective. The court
recognized, however, that its analysis risked bypassing equal protection
scrutiny, so it fashioned an additional test, asking whether VMI and
VWIL students would receive "substantively comparable" benefits.
Although the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the VWIL degree
lacked the historical benefit and prestige of a VMI degree, the court
nevertheless found the educational opportunities at the two schools sufficiently comparable.

Held:

1. Parties who seek to defend gender-based government action must
demonstrate an "exceedingly persuasive justification" for that action.
E. g., Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 724. Nei*Together with No. 94-2107, Virginia et al. v. United States, also on

ther federal nor state government acts compatibly with equal protection
when a law or official policy denies to women, simply because they are
women, full citizenship stature--equal opportunity to aspire, achieve,
participate in and contribute to society based on their individual talents
and capacities. To meet the burden of justification, a State must show
"at least that the [challenged] classification serves `important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed' are
`substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.' " Ibid.,
quoting Wengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co., 446 U. S. 142, 150. The
justification must be genuine, not hypothesized or invented post hoc in
response to litigation. And it must not rely on overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and
females. See, e. g., Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636, 643, 648.
The heightened review standard applicable to sex-based classifications
does not make sex a proscribed classification, but it does mean that
categorization by sex may not be used to create or perpetuate the legal,
social, and economic inferiority of women. Pp. 531-534.

2. Virginia's categorical exclusion of women from the educational
opportunities VMI provides denies equal protection to women.
Pp. 534-546.

(a) Virginia contends that single-sex education yields important educational benefits and that provision of an option for such education
fosters diversity in educational approaches. Benign justifications proffered in defense of categorical exclusions, however, must describe actual
state purposes, not rationalizations for actions in fact differently
grounded. Virginia has not shown that VMI was established, or has
been maintained, with a view to diversifying, by its categorical exclusion of women, educational opportunities within the Commonwealth.
A purpose genuinely to advance an array of educational options is not
served by VMI's historic and constant plan to afford a unique educational benefit only to males. However well this plan serves Virginia's
sons, it makes no provision whatever for her daughters. Pp. 535-540.

(b) Virginia also argues that VMI's adversative method of training
provides educational benefits that cannot be made available, unmodified,
to women, and that alterations to accommodate women would necessarily be so drastic as to destroy VMI's program. It is uncontested that
women's admission to VMI would require accommodations, primarily in
arranging housing assignments and physical training programs for
female cadets. It is also undisputed, however, that neither the goal of
producing citizen-soldiers, VMI's raison d'e^tre, nor VMI's implementing
methodology is inherently unsuitable to women. The District Court
made "findings" on "gender-based developmental differences" that restate the opinions of Virginia's expert witnesses about typically male
or typically female "tendencies." Courts, however, must take "a hard

look" at generalizations or tendencies of the kind Virginia pressed, for
state actors controlling gates to opportunity have no warrant to exclude
qualified individuals based on "fixed notions concerning the roles and
abilities of males and females." Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458
U. S., at 725. The notion that admission of women would downgrade
VMI's stature, destroy the adversative system and, with it, even the
school, is a judgment hardly proved, a prediction hardly different from
other "self-fulfilling prophec[ies], see id., at 730, once routinely used to
deny rights or opportunities. Women's successful entry into the federal military academies, and their participation in the Nation's military
forces, indicate that Virginia's fears for VMI's future may not be solidly
grounded. The Commonwealth's justification for excluding all women
from "citizen-soldier" training for which some are qualified, in any
event, does not rank as "exceedingly persuasive." Pp. 540-546.

3. The remedy proffered by Virginia--maintain VMI as a male-only
college and create VWIL as a separate program for women--does not
cure the constitutional violation. Pp. 546-558.

(a) A remedial decree must closely fit the constitutional violation;
it must be shaped to place persons unconstitutionally denied an opportunity or advantage in the position they would have occupied in the absence of discrimination. See Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 280.
The constitutional violation in this case is the categorical exclusion of
women, in disregard of their individual merit, from an extraordinary
educational opportunity afforded men. Virginia chose to leave untouched VMI's exclusionary policy, and proposed for women only a separate program, different in kind from VMI and unequal in tangible and
intangible facilities. VWIL affords women no opportunity to experience the rigorous military training for which VMI is famed. Kept away
from the pressures, hazards, and psychological bonding characteristic of
VMI's adversative training, VWIL students will not know the feeling of
tremendous accomplishment commonly experienced by VMI's successful
cadets. Virginia maintains that methodological differences are justified
by the important differences between men and women in learning and
developmental needs, but generalizations about "the way women are,"
estimates of what is appropriate for most women, no longer justify denying opportunity to women whose talent and capacity place them outside
the average description. In myriad respects other than military training, VWIL does not qualify as VMI's equal. The VWIL program is a
pale shadow of VMI in terms of the range of curricular choices and
faculty stature, funding, prestige, alumni support and influence. Virginia has not shown substantial equality in the separate educational
opportunities the Commonwealth supports at VWIL and VMI. Cf.
Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629. Pp. 547-554.

(b) The Fourth Circuit failed to inquire whether the proposed remedy placed women denied the VMI advantage in the position they would
have occupied in the absence of discrimination, Milliken, 433 U. S., at
280, and considered instead whether the Commonwealth could provide,
with fidelity to equal protection, separate and unequal educational programs for men and women. In declaring the substantially different
and significantly unequal VWIL program satisfactory, the appeals court
displaced the exacting standard developed by this Court with a deferential standard, and added an inquiry of its own invention, the "substantive comparability" test. The Fourth Circuit plainly erred in exposing
Virginia's VWIL plan to such a deferential analysis, for "all genderbased classifications today" warrant "heightened scrutiny." See J. E. B.
v. Alabama ex rel. T. B., 511 U. S. 127, 136. Women seeking and fit
for a VMI-quality education cannot be offered anything less, under the
Commonwealth's obligation to afford them genuinely equal protection.

520 UNITED STATES v. VIRGINIA

Opinion of the Court

I
Founded in 1839, VMI is today the sole single-sex schoolamong Virginia's 15 public institutions of higher learning.

VMI's distinctive mission is to produce "citizen-soldiers,"men prepared for leadership in civilian life and in military
service. VMI pursues this mission through pervasive training of a kind not available anywhere else in Virginia. As-signing prime place to character development, VMI uses an

"adversative method" modeled on English public schools
and once characteristic of military instruction. VMI con-stantly endeavors to instill physical and mental discipline in

its cadets and impart to them a strong moral code. Theschool's graduates leave VMI with heightened comprehension of their capacity to deal with duress and stress, and alarge sense of accomplishment for completing the hazardous
course.VMI has notably succeeded in its mission to produce leaders; among its alumni are military generals, Members of
Congress, and business executives. The school's alumnioverwhelmingly perceive that their VMI training helped

them to realize their personal goals. VMI's endowmentreflects the loyalty of its graduates; VMI has the largest
per-student endowment of all public undergraduate institu-tions in the Nation.

Neither the goal of producing citizen-soldiers norVMI's implementing methodology is inherently unsuitable
to women. And the school's impressive record in producing
leaders has made admission desirable to some women. Nev-ertheless, Virginia has elected to preserve exclusively for

men the advantages and opportunities a VMI educationaffords.

" `to produce educated and honorable men, prepared forthe varied work of civil life, imbued with love of learning, confident in the functions and attitudes of leader-ship, possessing a high sense of public service, advocates

women. See A. Scott, The Southern Lady: From Pedestal to Politics,
1830-1930, p. 82 (1970).

single sex; by the mid-1970's, however, all except VMI had become coeducational. 766 F. Supp. 1407, 1418-1419 (WD Va. 1991). For example,
Virginia's legislature incorporated Farmville Female Seminary Association in 1839, the year VMI opened. 1839 Va. Acts, ch. 167. Originally
providing instruction in "English, Latin, Greek, French, and piano" in a
"home atmosphere," R. Sprague, Longwood College: A History 7-8, 15
(1989) (Longwood College), Farmville Female Seminary became a public
institution in 1884 with a mission to train "white female teachers for public
schools," 1884 Va. Acts, ch. 311. The school became Longwood College
in 1949, Longwood College 136, and introduced coeducation in 1976, id.,

time of national peril.' " 766 F. Supp. 1407, 1425 (WDVa. 1991) (quoting Mission Study Committee of the VMI

Board of Visitors, Report, May 16, 1986).
In contrast to the federal service academies, institutionsmaintained "to prepare cadets for career service in the

armed forces," VMI's program "is directed at preparationfor both military and civilian life"; "[o]nly about 15% of
VMI cadets enter career military service." 766 F. Supp., at1432.

VMI produces its "citizen-soldiers" through "an adversa-tive, or doubting, model of education" which features "[p]hysical rigor, mental stress, absolute equality of treatment,absence of privacy, minute regulation of behavior, and indoctrination in desirable values." Id., at 1421. As one Com-mandant of Cadets described it, the adversative method
" `dissects the young student,' " and makes him aware ofhis " `limits and capabilities,' " so that he knows " `how far
he can go with his anger, . . . how much he can take understress, . . . exactly what he can do when he is physically
exhausted.' " Id., at 1421-1422 (quoting Col. N. Bissell).VMI cadets live in spartan barracks where surveillance is
constant and privacy nonexistent; they wear uniforms, eattogether in the mess hall, and regularly participate in drills.
Id., at 1424, 1432. Entering students are incessantly ex-posed to the rat line, "an extreme form of the adversative
model," comparable in intensity to Marine Corps boot camp.Id., at 1422. Tormenting and punishing, the rat line bonds
new cadets to their fellow sufferers and, when they havecompleted the 7-month experience, to their former tormentors. Ibid.VMI's "adversative model" is further characterized by a
hierarchical "class system" of privileges and responsibilities,a "dyke system" for assigning a senior class mentor to each
entering class "rat," and a stringently enforced "honor code,"which prescribes that a cadet " `does not lie, cheat, steal nor
tolerate those who do.' " Id., at 1422-1423.

VMI attracts some applicants because of its reputation asan extraordinarily challenging military school, and "because

its alumni are exceptionally close to the school." Id., at1421. "[W]omen have no opportunity anywhere to gain the

In 1990, prompted by a complaint filed with the AttorneyGeneral by a female high-school student seeking admission

to VMI, the United States sued the Commonwealth of Vir-ginia and VMI, alleging that VMI's exclusively male admission policy violated the Equal Protection Clause of theFourteenth Amendment. Id., at 1408.

3 Trial of the action

consumed six days and involved an array of expert witnesseson each side. Ibid.

In the two years preceding the lawsuit, the District Courtnoted, VMI had received inquiries from 347 women, but had
responded to none of them. Id., at 1436. "[S]ome women,at least," the court said, "would want to attend the school if
they had the opportunity." Id., at 1414. The court furtherrecognized that, with recruitment, VMI could "achieve at
least 10% female enrollment"--"a sufficient `critical mass' toprovide the female cadets with a positive educational experience." Id., at 1437-1438. And it was also establishedthat "some women are capable of all of the individual activities required of VMI cadets." Id., at 1412. In addition, ex-perts agreed that if VMI admitted women, "the VMI ROTC
experience would become a better training program from theperspective of the armed forces, because it would provide
training in dealing with a mixed-gender army." Id., at 1441.The District Court ruled in favor of VMI, however, and
rejected the equal protection challenge pressed by theUnited States. That court correctly recognized that

Mississippi Univ. for
Women, 458 U. S., at 724 (internal quotation marks omitted).
To succeed, the defender of the challenged action must show"at least that the classification serves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employedare substantially related to the achievement of those objectives." Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).The District Court reasoned that education in "a singlegender environment, be it male or female," yields substantial
benefits. 766 F. Supp., at 1415. VMI's school for men
brought diversity to an otherwise coeducational Virginia
system, and that diversity was "enhanced by VMI's unique
method of instruction." Ibid. If single-gender education
for males ranks as an important governmental objective, it
becomes obvious, the District Court concluded, that the only
means of achieving the objective "is to exclude women from
the all-male institution--VMI." Ibid.

"Women are [indeed] denied a unique educational opportunity that is available only at VMI," the District Court acknowledged. Id., at 1432. But "[VMI's] single-sex status
would be lost, and some aspects of the [school's] distinctive
method would be altered," if women were admitted, id., at
1413: "Allowance for personal privacy would have to be
made," id., at 1412; "[p]hysical education requirements would
have to be altered, at least for the women," id., at 1413; the
adversative environment could not survive unmodified, id.,
at 1412-1413. Thus, "sufficient constitutional justification"
had been shown, the District Court held, "for continuing
[VMI's] single-sex policy." Id., at 1413.

The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit disagreed and
vacated the District Court's judgment. The appellate court
held: "The Commonwealth of Virginia has not . . . advanced
any state policy by which it can justify its determination,

Opinion of the Court
under an announced policy of diversity, to afford VMI'sunique type of program to men and not to women." 976

F. 2d 890, 892 (1992).The appeals court greeted with skepticism Virginia's assertion that it offers single-sex education at VMI as a facet
of the Commonwealth's overarching and undisputed policy toadvance "autonomy and diversity." The court underscored

Virginia's nondiscrimination commitment: " `[I]t is extremelyimportant that [colleges and universities] deal with faculty,
staff, and students without regard to sex, race, or ethnic
origin.' " Id., at 899 (quoting 1990 Report of the Virginia
Commission on the University of the 21st Century). "That
statement," the Court of Appeals said, "is the only explicit
one that we have found in the record in which the Commonwealth has expressed itself with respect to gender distinctions." 976 F. 2d, at 899. Furthermore, the appeals court
observed, in urging "diversity" to justify an all-male VMI,
the Commonwealth had supplied "no explanation for the
movement away from [single-sex education] in Virginia by
public colleges and universities." Ibid. In short, the court
concluded, "[a] policy of diversity which aims to provide an
array of educational opportunities, including single-gender
institutions, must do more than favor one gender." Ibid.

The parties agreed that "some women can meet the physical standards now imposed on men," id., at 896, and the court
was satisfied that "neither the goal of producing citizen soldiers nor VMI's implementing methodology is inherently unsuitable to women," id., at 899. The Court of Appeals, however, accepted the District Court's finding that "at least
these three aspects of VMI's program--physical training, the
absence of privacy, and the adversative approach--would be
materially affected by coeducation." Id., at 896-897. Remanding the case, the appeals court assigned to Virginia,
in the first instance, responsibility for selecting a remedial
course. The court suggested these options for the Commonwealth: Admit women to VMI; establish parallel institutions

or programs; or abandon state support, leaving VMI free topursue its policies as a private institution. Id., at 900. In

May 1993, this Court denied certiorari. See 508 U. S. 946;see also ibid. (opinion of

Scalia, J., noting the interlocutoryposture of the litigation).

C
In response to the Fourth Circuit's ruling, Virginia pro-posed a parallel program for women: Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership (VWIL). The 4-year, state-sponsoredundergraduate program would be located at Mary Baldwin
College, a private liberal arts school for women, and wouldbe open, initially, to about 25 to 30 students. Although
VWIL would share VMI's mission--to produce "citizen-soldiers"--the VWIL program would differ, as does Mary
Baldwin College, from VMI in academic offerings, methodsof education, and financial resources. See 852 F. Supp. 471,
476-477 (WD Va. 1994).The average combined SAT score of entrants at Mary
Baldwin is about 100 points lower than the score for VMIfreshmen. See id., at 501. Mary Baldwin's faculty holds
"significantly fewer Ph. D.'s than the faculty at VMI," id.,at 502, and receives significantly lower salaries, see Tr. 158
(testimony of James Lott, Dean of Mary Baldwin College),reprinted in 2 App. in Nos. 94-1667 and 94-1717 (CA4) (hereinafter Tr.). While VMI offers degrees in liberal arts, thesciences, and engineering, Mary Baldwin, at the time of trial,
offered only bachelor of arts degrees. See 852 F. Supp., at503. A VWIL student seeking to earn an engineering degree could gain one, without public support, by attendingWashington University in St. Louis, Missouri, for two years,
paying the required private tuition. See ibid.Experts in educating women at the college level composed
the Task Force charged with designing the VWIL program;Task Force members were drawn from Mary Baldwin's own
faculty and staff. Id., at 476. Training its attention onmethods of instruction appropriate for "most women," the

Opinion of the Court
Task Force determined that a military model would be"wholly inappropriate" for VWIL. Ibid.; see 44 F. 3d 1229,

1233 (CA4 1995).VWIL students would participate in ROTC programs and
a newly established, "largely ceremonial" Virginia Corps ofCadets,

id., at 1234, but the VWIL House would not have amilitary format, 852 F. Supp., at 477, and VWIL would not

require its students to eat meals together or to wear uni-forms during the schoolday, id., at 495. In lieu of VMI's adversative method, the VWIL Task Force favored "a coopera-tive method which reinforces self-esteem." Id., at 476. In
addition to the standard bachelor of arts program offered atMary Baldwin, VWIL students would take courses in leadership, complete an off-campus leadership externship, partici-pate in community service projects, and assist in arranging
a speaker series. See 44 F. 3d, at 1234.Virginia represented that it will provide equal financial
support for in-state VWIL students and VMI cadets, 852F. Supp., at 483, and the VMI Foundation agreed to supply
a $5.4625 million endowment for the VWIL program, id., at499. Mary Baldwin's own endowment is about $19 million;
VMI's is $131 million. Id., at 503. Mary Baldwin will add$35 million to its endowment based on future commitments;
VMI will add $220 million. Ibid. The VMI Alumni Associ-ation has developed a network of employers interested in
hiring VMI graduates. The Association has agreed to openits network to VWIL graduates,

id., at 499, but those gradu-ates will not have the advantage afforded by a VMI degree.

D
Virginia returned to the District Court seeking approvalof its proposed remedial plan, and the court decided the

plan met the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause.Id., at 473. The District Court again acknowledged evidentiary support for these determinations: "[T]he VMI method-ology could be used to educate women and, in fact, some

Opinion of the Court
women . . . may prefer the VMI methodology to the VWILmethodology."

Id., at 481. But the "controlling legal principles," the District Court decided, "do not require the Com-monwealth to provide a mirror image VMI for women."

Ibid. The court anticipated that the two schools would
"achieve substantially similar outcomes." Ibid. It con-cluded: "If VMI marches to the beat of a drum, then Mary

Baldwin marches to the melody of a fife and when the marchis over, both will have arrived at the same destination."
Id., at 484.A divided Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's
judgment. 44 F. 3d 1229 (CA4 1995). This time, the appellate court determined to give "greater scrutiny to the selection of means than to the [Commonwealth's] proffered objective." Id., at 1236. The official objective or purpose, the
court said, should be reviewed deferentially. Ibid. Respect for the "legislative will," the court reasoned, meant
that the judiciary should take a "cautious approach," inquiring into the "legitima[cy]" of the governmental objective and
refusing approval for any purpose revealed to be "pernicious." Ibid.

"[P]roviding the option of a single-gender college education may be considered a legitimate and important aspect
of a public system of higher education," the appeals court
observed, id., at 1238; that objective, the court added, is "not
pernicious," id., at 1239. Moreover, the court continued, the
adversative method vital to a VMI education "has never
been tolerated in a sexually heterogeneous environment."
Ibid. The method itself "was not designed to exclude
women," the court noted, but women could not be accommodated in the VMI program, the court believed, for female
participation in VMI's adversative training "would destroy
. . . any sense of decency that still permeates the relationship
between the sexes." Ibid.

Having determined, deferentially, the legitimacy of Virginia's purpose, the court considered the question of means.

529Cite as: 518 U. S. 515 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
Exclusion of "men at Mary Baldwin College and womenat VMI," the court said, was essential to Virginia's purpose,

for without such exclusion, the Commonwealth could not"accomplish [its] objective of providing single-gender education." Ibid.

The court recognized that, as it analyzed the case, meansmerged into end, and the merger risked "bypass[ing] any

equal protection scrutiny." Id., at 1237. The court there-fore added another inquiry, a decisive test it called "substantive comparability." Ibid. The key question, the courtsaid, was whether men at VMI and women at VWIL would
obtain "substantively comparable benefits at their institution
or through other means offered by the [S]tate." Ibid. Although the appeals court recognized that the VWIL degree
"lacks the historical benefit and prestige" of a VMI degree, it
nevertheless found the educational opportunities at the two
schools "sufficiently comparable." Id., at 1241.

Senior Circuit Judge Phillips dissented. The court, in his
judgment, had not held Virginia to the burden of showing
an " `exceedingly persuasive [ justification]' " for the Commonwealth's action. Id., at 1247 (quoting Mississippi Univ.
for Women, 458 U. S., at 724). In Judge Phillips' view, the
court had accepted "rationalizations compelled by the exigencies of this litigation," and had not confronted the Commonwealth's "actual overriding purpose." 44 F. 3d, at 1247.
That purpose, Judge Phillips said, was clear from the historical record; it was "not to create a new type of educational
opportunity for women, . . . nor to further diversify the
Commonwealth's higher education system[,] . . . but [was]
simply . . . to allow VMI to continue to exclude women in
order to preserve its historic character and mission." Ibid.

Judge Phillips suggested that the Commonwealth would
satisfy the Constitution's equal protection requirement if
it "simultaneously opened single-gender undergraduate institutions having substantially comparable curricular and
extra-curricular programs, funding, physical plant, adminis518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT

proposed VWIL program, in comparison to VMI, fell "farshort . . . from providing substantially equal tangible and
intangible educational benefits to men and women." Ibid.The Fourth Circuit denied rehearing en banc. 52 F. 3d 90
(1995). Circuit Judge Motz, joined by Circuit Judges Hall,Murnaghan, and Michael, filed a dissenting opinion.

Motz agreed with Judge Phillips that Virginia had not shownan " `exceedingly persuasive justification' " for the disparate opportunities the Commonwealth supported. Id., at 92(quoting

Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U. S., at 724).She asked: "[H]ow can a degree from a yet to be implemented supplemental program at Mary Baldwin be held `sub-stantively comparable' to a degree from a venerable Virginia
military institution that was established more than 150 yearsago?" 52 F. 3d, at 93. "Women need not be guaranteed
equal `results,' " Judge Motz said, "but the Equal ProtectionClause does require equal opportunity . . . [and] that opportunity is being denied here." Ibid.

III
The cross-petitions in this suit present two ultimate is-sues. First, does Virginia's exclusion of women from the

educational opportunities provided by VMI--extraordinaryopportunities for military training and civilian leadership
development--deny to women "capable of all of the individ-ual activities required of VMI cadets," 766 F. Supp., at 1412,
the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Four-teenth Amendment? Second, if VMI's "unique" situation,

We note, once again, the core instruction of this Court'spathmarking decisions in J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B.,

511 U. S. 127, 136-137, and n. 6 (1994), and Mississippi Univ.for Women, 458 U. S., at 724 (internal quotation marks omitted): Parties who seek to defend gender-based governmentaction must demonstrate an "exceedingly persuasive justification" for that action.Today's skeptical scrutiny of official action denying rights
or opportunities based on sex responds to volumes of history.As a plurality of this Court acknowledged a generation ago,
"our Nation has had a long and unfortunate history of sexdiscrimination."

Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677,684 (1973). Through a century plus three decades and more

of that history, women did not count among voters composing"We the People";

5 not until 1920 did women gain a constitutional right to the franchise. Id., at 685. And for a halfcentury thereafter, it remained the prevailing doctrine that

government, both federal and state, could withhold fromwomen opportunities accorded men so long as any "basis in
reason" could be conceived for the discrimination. See, e. g.,
Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U. S. 464, 467 (1948) (rejecting chal-lenge of female tavern owner and her daughter to Michigan

law denying bartender licenses to females--except for wivesand daughters of male tavern owners; Court would not "give

In 1971, for the first time in our Nation's history, thisCourt ruled in favor of a woman who complained that her
State had denied her the equal protection of its laws. Reedv.

Reed, 404 U. S. 71, 73 (holding unconstitutional Idaho Codeprescription that, among " `several persons claiming and

equally entitled to administer [a decedent's estate], malesmust be preferred to females' "). Since Reed, the Court has
repeatedly recognized that neither federal nor state govern-ment acts compatibly with the equal protection principle
when a law or official policy denies to women, simply becausethey are women, full citizenship stature--equal opportunity
to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to societybased on their individual talents and capacities. See,

e. g.,Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 450 U. S. 455, 462-463 (1981) (affirming invalidity of Louisiana law that made husband "head andmaster" of property jointly owned with his wife, giving him
unilateral right to dispose of such property without his wife'sconsent);

Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S. 7 (1975) (invalidatingUtah requirement that parents support boys until age 21,

girls only until age 18).Without equating gender classifications, for all purposes,
to classifications based on race or national origin,6 the Court,in post-Reed decisions, has carefully inspected official action
that closes a door or denies opportunity to women (or tomen). See

J. E. B., 511 U. S., at 152 (Kennedy, J., concur-ring in judgment) (case law evolving since 1971 "reveal[s] a

tial treatment or denial of opportunity for which relief issought, the reviewing court must determine whether the

proffered justification is "exceedingly persuasive." Theburden of justification is demanding and it rests entirely on
the State. See Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U. S., at
724. The State must show "at least that the [challenged]classification serves `important governmental objectives and

that the discriminatory means employed' are `substantiallyrelated to the achievement of those objectives.' "

Ibid. (quoting Wengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co., 446 U. S. 142, 150(1980)). The justification must be genuine, not hypothesized

or invented post hoc in response to litigation. And it must
not rely on overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females. See
Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636, 643, 648 (1975);
Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U. S. 199, 223-224 (1977) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).

The heightened review standard our precedent establishes
does not make sex a proscribed classification. Supposed "inherent differences" are no longer accepted as a ground for
race or national origin classifications. See Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967). Physical differences between men
and women, however, are enduring: "[T]he two sexes are not
fungible; a community made up exclusively of one [sex] is
different from a community composed of both." Ballard v.
United States, 329 U. S. 187, 193 (1946).

"Inherent differences" between men and women, we have
come to appreciate, remain cause for celebration, but not for
denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial constraints on an individual's opportunity. Sex classifications
may be used to compensate women "for particular economic
disabilities [they have] suffered," Califano v. Webster, 430
U. S. 313, 320 (1977) (per curiam), to "promot[e] equal employment opportunity," see California Fed. Sav. & Loan
Assn. v. Guerra, 479 U. S. 272, 289 (1987), to advance full

ple.7 But such classifications may not be used, as they oncewere, see Goesaert, 335 U. S., at 467, to create or perpetuate

the legal, social, and economic inferiority of women.Measuring the record in this case against the review
standard just described, we conclude that Virginia has shownno "exceedingly persuasive justification" for excluding all
women from the citizen-soldier training afforded by VMI.We therefore affirm the Fourth Circuit's initial judgment,
which held that Virginia had violated the FourteenthAmendment's Equal Protection Clause. Because the remedy proffered by Virginia--the Mary Baldwin VWIL pro-gram--does not cure the constitutional violation,

i. e., it doesnot provide equal opportunity, we reverse the Fourth Circuit's final judgment in this case.

The Fourth Circuit initially held that Virginia had ad-vanced no state policy by which it could justify, under equal

protection principles, its determination "to afford VMI'sunique type of program to men and not to women." 976
F. 2d, at 892. Virginia challenges that "liability" ruling andasserts two justifications in defense of VMI's exclusion of

7 Several amici have urged that diversity in educational opportunities
is an altogether appropriate governmental pursuit and that single-sex
schools can contribute importantly to such diversity. Indeed, it is the
mission of some single-sex schools "to dissipate, rather than perpetuate,
traditional gender classifications." See Brief for Twenty-six Private
Women's Colleges as Amici Curiae 5. We do not question the Commonwealth's prerogative evenhandedly to support diverse educational opportunities. We address specifically and only an educational opportunity
recognized by the District Court and the Court of Appeals as "unique,"
see 766 F. Supp., at 1413, 1432; 976 F. 2d, at 892, an opportunity available
only at Virginia's premier military institute, the Commonwealth's sole
single-sex public university or college. Cf. Mississippi Univ. for Women
v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 720, n. 1 (1982) ("Mississippi maintains no other
single-sex public university or college. Thus, we are not faced with the

Cross-Petitioners 20, and the option of single-sex educationcontributes to "diversity in educational approaches," id., at
25. Second, the Commonwealth argues, "the unique VMImethod of character development and leadership training,"
the school's adversative approach, would have to be modifiedwere VMI to admit women.

Id., at 33-36 (internal quota-tion marks omitted). We consider these two justifications

in turn. A

Single-sex education affords pedagogical benefits to atleast some students, Virginia emphasizes, and that reality is
uncontested in this litigation.8 Similarly, it is not disputedthat diversity among public educational institutions can
serve the public good. But Virginia has not shown thatVMI was established, or has been maintained, with a view
to diversifying, by its categorical exclusion of women, ed-ucational opportunities within the Commonwealth. In cases
of this genre, our precedent instructs that "benign" justifi-cations proffered in defense of categorical exclusions will
not be accepted automatically; a tenable justification mustdescribe actual state purposes, not rationalizations for ac8 On this point, the dissent sees fire where there is no flame. See post,
at 596-598, 598-600. "Both men and women can benefit from a single-sex
education," the District Court recognized, although "the beneficial effects"
of such education, the court added, apparently "are stronger among women
than among men." 766 F. Supp., at 1414. The United States does not
challenge that recognition. Cf. C. Jencks & D. Riesman, The Academic
Revolution 297-298 (1968):

"The pluralistic argument for preserving all-male colleges is uncomfortably similar to the pluralistic argument for preserving all-white colleges . . . . The all-male college would be relatively easy to defend if
it emerged from a world in which women were established as fully equal
to men. But it does not. It is therefore likely to be a witting or unwitting device for preserving tacit assumptions of male superiority--assumptions for which women must eventually pay."

tions in fact differently grounded. See Wiesenfeld, 420U. S., at 648, and n. 16 ("mere recitation of a benign [or]

compensatory purpose" does not block "inquiry into theactual purposes" of government-maintained gender-based
classifications); Goldfarb, 430 U. S., at 212-213 (rejectinggovernment-proffered purposes after "inquiry into the actual purposes" (internal quotation marks omitted)).

Mississippi Univ. for Women is immediately in point.There the State asserted, in justification of its exclusion of

men from a nursing school, that it was engaging in "ed-ucational affirmative action" by "compensat[ing] for discrimination against women." 458 U. S., at 727. Undertaking a"searching analysis,"

id., at 728, the Court found no closeresemblance between "the alleged objective" and "the actual

purpose underlying the discriminatory classification," id., at730. Pursuing a similar inquiry here, we reach the same
conclusion.Neither recent nor distant history bears out Virginia's
alleged pursuit of diversity through single-sex educationaloptions. In 1839, when the Commonwealth established
VMI, a range of educational opportunities for men andwomen was scarcely contemplated. Higher education at
the time was considered dangerous for women; 9 reflecting

9 Dr. Edward H. Clarke of Harvard Medical School, whose influential
book, Sex in Education, went through 17 editions, was perhaps the most
well-known speaker from the medical community opposing higher education for women. He maintained that the physiological effects of hard
study and academic competition with boys would interfere with the development of girls' reproductive organs. See E. Clarke, Sex in Education
38-39, 62-63 (1873); id., at 127 ("identical education of the two sexes is a
crime before God and humanity, that physiology protests against, and that
experience weeps over"); see also H. Maudsley, Sex in Mind and in Education 17 (1874) ("It is not that girls have not ambition, nor that they fail
generally to run the intellectual race [in coeducational settings], but it is
asserted that they do it at a cost to their strength and health which entails
life-long suffering, and even incapacitates them for the adequate performance of the natural functions of their sex."); C. Meigs, Females and Their
Diseases 350 (1848) (after five or six weeks of "mental and educational

widely held views about women's proper place, the Nation'sfirst universities and colleges--for example, Harvard in Massachusetts, William and Mary in Virginia--admitted onlymen. See E. Farello, A History of the Education of Women
in the United States 163 (1970). VMI was not at all novel
in this respect: In admitting no women, VMI followed thelead of the Commonwealth's flagship school, the University

of Virginia, founded in 1819."[N]o struggle for the admission of women to a state university," a historian has recounted, "was longer drawn out,or developed more bitterness, than that at the University of
Virginia." 2 T. Woody, A History of Women's Education inthe United States 254 (1929) (History of Women's Education).
In 1879, the State Senate resolved to look into the possibility
of higher education for women, recognizing that Virginia" `has never, at any period of her history,' " provided for the

higher education of her daughters, though she " `has liberallyprovided for the higher education of her sons.' "

Ibid. (quoting 10 Educ. J. Va. 212 (1879)). Despite this recognition, nonew opportunities were instantly open to women.

Virginia eventually provided for several women's seminar-ies and colleges. Farmville Female Seminary became a public institution in 1884. See supra, at 521, n. 2. Two women'sschools, Mary Washington College and James Madison University, were founded in 1908; another, Radford University,was founded in 1910. 766 F. Supp., at 1418-1419. By the
mid-1970's, all four schools had become coeducational. Ibid.Debate concerning women's admission as undergraduates
at the main university continued well past the century's
midpoint. Familiar arguments were rehearsed. If women

were admitted, it was feared, they "would encroach on therights of men; there would be new problems of government,

perhaps scandals; the old honor system would have to bechanged; standards would be lowered to those of other coeducational schools; and the glorious reputation of the univer-sity, as a school for men, would be trailed in the dust." 2
History of Women's Education 255.Ultimately, in 1970, "the most prestigious institution of
higher education in Virginia," the University of Virginia,introduced coeducation and, in 1972, began to admit women
on an equal basis with men. See Kirstein v. Rector and
Visitors of Univ. of Virginia, 309 F. Supp. 184, 186 (ED Va.1970). A three-judge Federal District Court confirmed:

"Virginia may not now deny to women, on the basis ofsex, educational opportunities at the Charlottesville campus
that are not afforded in other institutions operated by the[S]tate."

Id., at 187.Virginia describes the current absence of public single-sex

higher education for women as "an historical anomaly."Brief for Cross-Petitioners 30. But the historical record indicates action more deliberate than anomalous: First, protec-tion of women against higher education; next, schools for
women far from equal in resources and stature to schoolsfor men; finally, conversion of the separate schools to coeducation. The state legislature, prior to the advent of thiscontroversy, had repealed "[a]ll Virginia statutes requiring
individual institutions to admit only men or women." 766F. Supp., at 1419. And in 1990, an official commission, "legislatively established to chart the future goals of higher edu-cation in Virginia," reaffirmed the policy " `of affording broad
access" while maintaining "autonomy and diversity.' " 976F. 2d, at 898-899 (quoting Report of the Virginia Commission
on the University of the 21st Century). Significantly, thecommission reported:

models, it is extremely important that they deal withfaculty, staff, and students without regard to sex, race,

or ethnic origin.' " Id., at 899 (emphasis supplied byCourt of Appeals deleted).

This statement, the Court of Appeals observed, "is the onlyexplicit one that we have found in the record in which the
Commonwealth has expressed itself with respect to genderdistinctions." Ibid.

Our 1982 decision in Mississippi Univ. for Womenprompted VMI to reexamine its male-only admission policy.
See 766 F. Supp., at 1427-1428. Virginia relies on thatreexamination as a legitimate basis for maintaining VMI's
single-sex character. See Reply Brief for Cross-Petitioners6. A Mission Study Committee, appointed by the VMI
Board of Visitors, studied the problem from October 1983until May 1986, and in that month counseled against "change
of VMI status as a single-sex college." See 766 F. Supp., at1429 (internal quotation marks omitted). Whatever internal purpose the Mission Study Committee served--and how-ever well meaning the framers of the report--we can hardly
extract from that effort any commonwealth policy even-handedly to advance diverse educational options. As the
District Court observed, the Committee's analysis "primarilyfocuse[d] on anticipated difficulties in attracting females to
VMI," and the report, overall, supplied "very little indicationof how th[e] conclusion was reached."

Ibid.In sum, we find no persuasive evidence in this record that

VMI's male-only admission policy "is in furtherance of astate policy of `diversity.' " See 976 F. 2d, at 899. No such
policy, the Fourth Circuit observed, can be discerned fromthe movement of all other public colleges and universities in
Virginia away from single-sex education. See ibid. Thatcourt also questioned "how one institution with autonomy,
but with no authority over any other state institution, cangive effect to a state policy of diversity among institutions."

tional options, as the Court of Appeals recognized, is notserved by VMI's historic and constant plan--a plan to "affor[d] a unique educational benefit only to males." Ibid.However "liberally" this plan serves the Commonwealth's
sons, it makes no provision whatever for her daughters.That is not

equal protection.

B
Virginia next argues that VMI's adversative method oftraining provides educational benefits that cannot be made

available, unmodified, to women. Alterations to accommo-date women would necessarily be "radical," so "drastic," Virginia asserts, as to transform, indeed "destroy," VMI's pro-gram. See Brief for Cross-Petitioners 34-36. Neither sex
would be favored by the transformation, Virginia maintains:Men would be deprived of the unique opportunity currently
available to them; women would not gain that opportunitybecause their participation would "eliminat[e] the very aspects of [the] program that distinguish [VMI] from . . . otherinstitutions of higher education in Virginia." Id., at 34.

The District Court forecast from expert witness testi-mony, and the Court of Appeals accepted, that coeducation
would materially affect "at least these three aspects of VMI'sprogram--physical training, the absence of privacy, and the
adversative approach." 976 F. 2d, at 896-897. And it is un-contested that women's admission would require accommodations, primarily in arranging housing assignments and physi-cal training programs for female cadets. See Brief for
Cross-Respondent 11, 29-30. It is also undisputed, how-ever, that "the VMI methodology could be used to educate
women." 852 F. Supp., at 481. The District Court even al-lowed that some women may prefer it to the methodology a
women's college might pursue. See ibid. "[S]ome women,at least, would want to attend [VMI] if they had the opportunity," the District Court recognized, 766 F. Supp., at 1414,and "some women," the expert testimony established, "are

capable of all of the individual activities required of VMIcadets,"

id., at 1412. The parties, furthermore, agree that
"some women can meet the physical standards [VMI] nowimpose[s] on men." 976 F. 2d, at 896. In sum, as the Court

of Appeals stated, "neither the goal of producing citizen soldiers," VMI's raison d'e^tre, "nor VMI's implementing meth-odology is inherently unsuitable to women."

Id., at 899.
In support of its initial judgment for Virginia, a judg-ment rejecting all equal protection objections presented by

the United States, the District Court made "findings" on"gender-based developmental differences." 766 F. Supp.,
at 1434-1435. These "findings" restate the opinions of Virginia's expert witnesses, opinions about typically male or
typically female "tendencies." Id., at 1434. For example,
"[m]ales tend to need an atmosphere of adversativeness,"
while "[f]emales tend to thrive in a cooperative atmosphere."
Ibid. "I'm not saying that some women don't do well under
[the] adversative model," VMI's expert on educational institutions testified, "undoubtedly there are some [women] who
do"; but educational experiences must be designed "around
the rule," this expert maintained, and not "around the exception." Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).

The United States does not challenge any expert witness
estimation on average capacities or preferences of men and
women. Instead, the United States emphasizes that time
and again since this Court's turning point decision in Reed v.
Reed, 404 U. S. 71 (1971), we have cautioned reviewing courts
to take a "hard look" at generalizations or "tendencies" of
the kind pressed by Virginia, and relied upon by the District
Court. See O'Connor, Portia's Progress, 66 N. Y. U. L. Rev.
1546, 1551 (1991). State actors controlling gates to opportunity, we have instructed, may not exclude qualified individuals based on "fixed notions concerning the roles and abilities
of males and females." Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458
U. S., at 725; see J. E. B., 511 U. S., at 139, n. 11 (equal protection principles, as applied to gender classifications, mean

Opinion of the Court
state actors may not rely on "overbroad" generalizations tomake "judgments about people that are likely to . . . perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination").It may be assumed, for purposes of this decision, that most
women would not choose VMI's adversative method. As
Fourth Circuit Judge Motz observed, however, in her dissentfrom the Court of Appeals' denial of rehearing en banc, it is

also probable that "many men would not want to be educatedin such an environment." 52 F. 3d, at 93. (On that point,
even our dissenting colleague might agree.) Education, tobe sure, is not a "one size fits all" business. The issue, however, is not whether "women--or men--should be forced toattend VMI"; rather, the question is whether the Commonwealth can constitutionally deny to women who have the will
and capacity, the training and attendant opportunities thatVMI uniquely affords.

Ibid.
The notion that admission of women would downgrade
VMI's stature, destroy the adversative system and, with it,
even the school,11 is a judgment hardly proved,12 a prediction

11 See post, at 566, 598-599, 603. Forecasts of the same kind were made
regarding admission of women to the federal military academies. See,
e. g., Hearings on H. R. 9832 et al. before Subcommittee No. 2 of the House
Committee on Armed Services, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., 137 (1975) (statement of Lt. Gen. A. P. Clark, Superintendent of U. S. Air Force Academy)
("It is my considered judgment that the introduction of female cadets will
inevitably erode this vital atmosphere."); id., at 165 (statement of Hon.
H. H. Callaway, Secretary of the Army) ("Admitting women to West Point
would irrevocably change the Academy. . . . The Spartan atmosphere--
which is so important to producing the final product--would surely be
diluted, and would in all probability disappear.").

12 See 766 F. Supp., at 1413 (describing testimony of expert witness

David Riesman: "[I]f VMI were to admit women, it would eventually find
it necessary to drop the adversative system altogether, and adopt a system that provides more nurturing and support for the students."). Such
judgments have attended, and impeded, women's progress toward full
citizenship stature throughout our Nation's history. Speaking in 1879
in support of higher education for females, for example, Virginia State
Senator C. T. Smith of Nelson recounted that legislation proposed to pro518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
hardly different from other "self-fulfilling prophec[ies]," seeMississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U. S., at 730, once routinely used to deny rights or opportunities. When womenfirst sought admission to the bar and access to legal education, concerns of the same order were expressed. For exam-ple, in 1876, the Court of Common Pleas of Hennepin County,
Minnesota, explained why women were thought ineligible forthe practice of law. Women train and educate the young,
the court said, which

"forbids that they shall bestow that time (early and late)and labor, so essential in attaining to the eminence to

which the true lawyer should ever aspire. It cannottherefore be said that the opposition of courts to the
admission of females to practice . . . is to any extent theoutgrowth of . . . `old fogyism[.]' . . . [I]t arises rather
from a comprehension of the magnitude of the responsi-bilities connected with the successful practice of law, and
a desire to grade up the profession." In re Applicationof Martha Angle Dorsett to Be Admitted to Practice as
Attorney and Counselor at Law (Minn. C. P. HennepinCty., 1876), in The Syllabi, Oct. 21, 1876, pp. 5, 6 (emphasis added).
A like fear, according to a 1925 report, accounted for Colum-bia Law School's resistance to women's admission, although

"[t]he faculty . . . never maintained that women couldnot master legal learning . . . . No, its argument has
been . . . more practical. If women were admitted to

that "not one of [the forecast "terrible consequences"] has or ever will
happen, even unto the sounding of Gabriel's trumpet." Ibid. See also

Medical faculties similarly resisted men and women aspartners in the study of medicine. See R. Morantz-Sanchez,
Sympathy and Science: Women Physicians in American Med-icine 51-54, 250 (1985); see also M. Walsh, "Doctors Wanted:
No Women Need Apply" 121-122 (1977) (quoting E. Clarke,Medical Education of Women, 4 Boston Med. & Surg. J. 345,
346 (1869) (" `God forbid that I should ever see men andwomen aiding each other to display with the scalpel the secrets of the reproductive system . . . .' ")); cf. supra, at 536-537, n. 9. More recently, women seeking careers in policing
encountered resistance based on fears that their presencewould "undermine male solidarity," see F. Heidensohn,
Women in Control? 201 (1992); deprive male partners of ade-quate assistance, see id., at 184-185; and lead to sexual misconduct, see C. Milton et al., Women in Policing 32-33 (1974).Field studies did not confirm these fears. See Heidensohn,

Opinion of the Court
may not be solidly grounded.15 The Commonwealth's justification for excluding all women from "citizen-soldier" training for which some are qualified, in any event, cannot rank
as "exceedingly persuasive," as we have explained and applied that standard.

Virginia and VMI trained their argument on "means"
rather than "end," and thus misperceived our precedent.
Single-sex education at VMI serves an "important governmental objective," they maintained, and exclusion of women
is not only "substantially related," it is essential to that objective. By this notably circular argument, the "straightforward" test Mississippi Univ. for Women described, see 458
U. S., at 724-725, was bent and bowed.

The Commonwealth's misunderstanding and, in turn, the
District Court's, is apparent from VMI's mission: to produce
"citizen-soldiers," individuals

" `imbued with love of learning, confident in the functions and attitudes of leadership, possessing a high sense
of public service, advocates of the American democracy
and free enterprise system, and ready . . . to defend their
country in time of national peril.' " 766 F. Supp., at
1425 (quoting Mission Study Committee of the VMI
Board of Visitors, Report, May 16, 1986).

Surely that goal is great enough to accommodate women,
who today count as citizens in our American democracy equal
in stature to men. Just as surely, the Commonwealth's

1996, p. C1, col. 2 (reporting admission of Sergeant Heather Johnsen to
elite Infantry unit that keeps round-the-clock vigil at Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery).

15 Inclusion of women in settings where, traditionally, they were not

wanted inevitably entails a period of adjustment. As one West Point
cadet squad leader recounted: "[T]he classes of '78 and '79 see the women
as women, but the classes of '80 and '81 see them as classmates." U. S.
Military Academy, A. Vitters, Report of Admission of Women (Project

Opinion of the Court
great goal is not substantially advanced by women's cate-gorical exclusion, in total disregard of their individual merit,

from the Commonwealth's premier "citizen-soldier" corps.16Virginia, in sum, "has fallen far short of establishing the
`exceedingly persuasive justification,' " Mississippi Univ. for
Women, 458 U. S., at 731, that must be the solid base forany gender-defined classification.

VI
In the second phase of the litigation, Virginia presentedits remedial plan--maintain VMI as a male-only college and

create VWIL as a separate program for women. The planmet District Court approval. The Fourth Circuit, in turn,
deferentially reviewed the Commonwealth's proposal anddecided that the two single-sex programs directly served
Virginia's reasserted purposes: single-gender education, and"achieving the results of an adversative method in a military environment." See 44 F. 3d, at 1236, 1239. Inspectingthe VMI and VWIL educational programs to determine
whether they "afford[ed] to both genders benefits compara-ble in substance, [if] not in form and detail,"

id., at 1240,the Court of Appeals concluded that Virginia had arranged

for men and women opportunities "sufficiently comparable"to survive equal protection evaluation,

id., at 1240-1241.The United States challenges this "remedial" ruling as pervasively misguided.

16 VMI has successfully managed another notable change. The school
admitted its first African-American cadets in 1968. See The VMI Story
347-349 (students no longer sing "Dixie," salute the Confederate flag or
the tomb of General Robert E. Lee at ceremonies and sports events). As
the District Court noted, VMI established a program on "retention of
black cadets" designed to offer academic and social-cultural support to
"minority members of a dominantly white and tradition-oriented student
body." 766 F. Supp., at 1436-1437. The school maintains a "special recruitment program for blacks" which, the District Court found, "has had
little, if any, effect on VMI's method of accomplishing its mission." Id.,
at 1437.

Opinion of the Court

A
A remedial decree, this Court has said, must closely fit theconstitutional violation; it must be shaped to place persons

unconstitutionally denied an opportunity or advantage in"the position they would have occupied in the absence of
[discrimination]." See Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267,280 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted). The constitutional violation in this suit is the categorical exclusion ofwomen from an extraordinary educational opportunity afforded men. A proper remedy for an unconstitutional ex-clusion, we have explained, aims to "eliminate [so far as possible] the discriminatory effects of the past" and to "bar likediscrimination in the future." Louisiana v. United States,
380 U. S. 145, 154 (1965).Virginia chose not to eliminate, but to leave untouched,
VMI's exclusionary policy. For women only, however, Vir-ginia proposed a separate program, different in kind from
VMI and unequal in tangible and intangible facilities.17Having violated the Constitution's equal protection requirement, Virginia was obliged to show that its remedial pro-posal "directly address[ed] and relate[d] to" the violation, see
Milliken, 433 U. S., at 282, i. e., the equal protection deniedto women ready, willing, and able to benefit from educational

17 As earlier observed, see supra, at 529, Judge Phillips, in dissent, measured Virginia's plan against a paradigm arrangement, one that "could survive equal protection scrutiny": single-sex schools with "substantially
comparable curricular and extra-curricular programs, funding, physical
plant, administration and support services, . . . faculty[,] and library resources." 44 F. 3d 1229, 1250 (CA4 1995). Cf. Bray v. Lee, 337 F. Supp.
934 (Mass. 1972) (holding inconsistent with the Equal Protection Clause
admission of males to Boston's Boys Latin School with a test score of 120
or higher (up to a top score of 200) while requiring a score, on the same
test, of at least 133 for admission of females to Girls Latin School, but
not ordering coeducation). Measuring VMI/VWIL against the paradigm,
Judge Phillips said, "reveals how far short the [Virginia] plan falls from
providing substantially equal tangible and intangible educational benefits
to men and women." 44 F. 3d, at 1250.

opportunities of the kind VMI offers. Virginia described

VMI's goals of providing "education, military training, mental and physical discipline, character . . . and leadership development." Brief for Respondents 24 (internal quotation
marks omitted). If the VWIL program could not "eliminate
the discriminatory effects of the past," could it at least "bar
like discrimination in the future"? See Louisiana, 380
U. S., at 154. A comparison of the programs said to be "parallel" informs our answer. In exposing the character of, and
differences in, the VMI and VWIL programs, we recapitulate facts earlier presented. See supra, at 520-523, 526-527.

VWIL affords women no opportunity to experience the
rigorous military training for which VMI is famed. See 766
F. Supp., at 1413-1414 ("No other school in Virginia or in
the United States, public or private, offers the same kind of
rigorous military training as is available at VMI."); id., at
1421 (VMI "is known to be the most challenging military
school in the United States"). Instead, the VWIL program
"deemphasize[s]" military education, 44 F. 3d, at 1234, and
uses a "cooperative method" of education "which reinforces
self-esteem," 852 F. Supp., at 476.

VWIL students participate in ROTC and a "largely ceremonial" Virginia Corps of Cadets, see 44 F. 3d, at 1234, but
Virginia deliberately did not make VWIL a military institute. The VWIL House is not a military-style residence and
VWIL students need not live together throughout the 4-year
program, eat meals together, or wear uniforms during the
schoolday. See 852 F. Supp., at 477, 495. VWIL students
thus do not experience the "barracks" life "crucial to the
VMI experience," the spartan living arrangements designed
to foster an "egalitarian ethic." See 766 F. Supp., at 1423-
1424. "[T]he most important aspects of the VMI educational experience occur in the barracks," the District Court

Opinion of the Court
found, id., at 1423, yet Virginia deemed that core experience
nonessential, indeed inappropriate, for training its female
citizen-soldiers.

VWIL students receive their "leadership training" in seminars, externships, and speaker series, see 852 F. Supp., at
477, episodes and encounters lacking the "[p]hysical rigor,
mental stress, . . . minute regulation of behavior, and indoctrination in desirable values" made hallmarks of VMI's
citizen-soldier training, see 766 F. Supp., at 1421.18 Kept
away from the pressures, hazards, and psychological bonding
characteristic of VMI's adversative training, see id., at 1422,
VWIL students will not know the "feeling of tremendous
accomplishment" commonly experienced by VMI's successful
cadets, id., at 1426.

Virginia maintains that these methodological differences
are "justified pedagogically," based on "important differences between men and women in learning and developmental needs," "psychological and sociological differences"
Virginia describes as "real" and "not stereotypes." Brief
for Respondents 28 (internal quotation marks omitted).
The Task Force charged with developing the leadership program for women, drawn from the staff and faculty at Mary
Baldwin College, "determined that a military model and,
especially VMI's adversative method, would be wholly inappropriate for educating and training most women." 852
F. Supp., at 476 (emphasis added). See also 44 F. 3d, at
1233-1234 (noting Task Force conclusion that, while "some
women would be suited to and interested in [a VMI-style
experience]," VMI's adversative method "would not be effective for women as a group" (emphasis added)). The Com18 Both programs include an honor system. Students at VMI are expelled forthwith for honor code violations, see 766 F. Supp., at 1423; the
system for VWIL students, see 852 F. Supp., at 496-497, is less severe,
see Tr. 414-415 (testimony of Mary Baldwin College President Cynthia
Tyson).

monwealth embraced the Task Force view, as did expertwitnesses who testified for Virginia. See 852 F. Supp.,

at 480-481.As earlier stated, see supra, at 541-542, generalizations
about "the way women are," estimates of what is appropriatefor

most women, no longer justify denying opportunity towomen whose talent and capacity place them outside the

average description. Notably, Virginia never assertedthat VMI's method of education suits most men. It is also
revealing that Virginia accounted for its failure to make theVWIL experience "the entirely militaristic experience of
VMI" on the ground that VWIL "is planned for women whodo not necessarily expect to pursue military careers." 852
F. Supp., at 478. By that reasoning, VMI's "entirely milita-ristic" program would be inappropriate for men in general
or as a group, for "[o]nly about 15% of VMI cadets entercareer military service." See 766 F. Supp., at 1432.

In contrast to the generalizations about women on whichVirginia rests, we note again these dispositive realities:
VMI's "implementing methodology" is not "inherently un-suitable to women," 976 F. 2d, at 899; "some women . . . do
well under [the] adversative model," 766 F. Supp., at 1434(internal quotation marks omitted); "some women, at least,
would want to attend [VMI] if they had the opportunity,"
id., at 1414; "some women are capable of all of the individual
activities required of VMI cadets," id., at 1412, and "canmeet the physical standards [VMI] now impose[s] on men,"

976 F. 2d, at 896. It is on behalf of these women that the
United States has instituted this suit, and it is for them thata remedy must be crafted,

B
In myriad respects other than military training, VWIL
does not qualify as VMI's equal. VWIL's student body, faculty, course offerings, and facilities hardly match VMI's.
Nor can the VWIL graduate anticipate the benefits associated with VMI's 157-year history, the school's prestige, and
its influential alumni network.

Mary Baldwin College, whose degree VWIL students will
gain, enrolls first-year women with an average combined
SAT score about 100 points lower than the average score for
VMI freshmen. 852 F. Supp., at 501. The Mary Baldwin
faculty holds "significantly fewer Ph. D.'s," id., at 502, and
receives substantially lower salaries, see Tr. 158 (testimony
of James Lott, Dean of Mary Baldwin College), than the
faculty at VMI.

Mary Baldwin does not offer a VWIL student the range
of curricular choices available to a VMI cadet. VMI awards
baccalaureate degrees in liberal arts, biology, chemistry, civil
engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and mechanical engineering. See 852 F. Supp., at 503; Virginia Military Institute: More than an Education 11 (Govt. exh. 75,

and Air Force Academies "shall be the same as those required for male
individuals, except for those minimum essential adjustments in such
standards required because of physiological differences between male and
female individuals"). Experience shows such adjustments are manageable. See U. S. Military Academy, A. Vitters, N. Kinzer, & J. Adams, Report of Admission of Women (Project Athena I-IV) (1977-1980) (4-year
longitudinal study of the admission of women to West Point); Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, Report on the Integration
and Performance of Women at West Point 17-18 (1992).

Opinion of the Court
lodged with Clerk of this Court). VWIL students attend a
school that "does not have a math and science focus," 852
F. Supp., at 503; they cannot take at Mary Baldwin any
courses in engineering or the advanced math and physics
courses VMI offers, see id., at 477.

For physical training, Mary Baldwin has "two multipurpose fields" and "[o]ne gymnasium." Id., at 503. VMI
has "an NCAA competition level indoor track and field facility; a number of multi-purpose fields; baseball, soccer and
lacrosse fields; an obstacle course; large boxing, wrestling
and martial arts facilities; an 11-laps-to-the-mile indoor running course; an indoor pool; indoor and outdoor rifle ranges;
and a football stadium that also contains a practice field and
outdoor track." Ibid.

Although Virginia has represented that it will provide
equal financial support for in-state VWIL students and VMI
cadets, id., at 483, and the VMI Foundation has agreed to
endow VWIL with $5.4625 million, id., at 499, the difference
between the two schools' financial reserves is pronounced.
Mary Baldwin's endowment, currently about $19 million, will
gain an additional $35 million based on future commitments;
VMI's current endowment, $131 million--the largest public
college per-student endowment in the Nation--will gain $220
million. Id., at 503.

The VWIL student does not graduate with the advantage
of a VMI degree. Her diploma does not unite her with the
legions of VMI "graduates [who] have distinguished themselves" in military and civilian life. See 976 F. 2d, at 892-
893. "[VMI] alumni are exceptionally close to the school,"
and that closeness accounts, in part, for VMI's success in
attracting applicants. See 766 F. Supp., at 1421. A VWIL
graduate cannot assume that the "network of business owners, corporations, VMI graduates and non-graduate employers . . . interested in hiring VMI graduates," 852 F. Supp., at
499, will be equally responsive to her search for employment,

Opinion of the Court
see 44 F. 3d, at 1250 (Phillips, J., dissenting) ("the powerful
political and economic ties of the VMI alumni network cannot
be expected to open" for graduates of the fledgling VWIL
program).

Virginia, in sum, while maintaining VMI for men only, has
failed to provide any "comparable single-gender women's
institution." Id., at 1241. Instead, the Commonwealth has
created a VWIL program fairly appraised as a "pale shadow"
of VMI in terms of the range of curricular choices and faculty
stature, funding, prestige, alumni support and influence.
See id., at 1250 (Phillips, J., dissenting).

Virginia's VWIL solution is reminiscent of the remedy
Texas proposed 50 years ago, in response to a state trial
court's 1946 ruling that, given the equal protection guarantee, African-Americans could not be denied a legal education
at a state facility. See Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629
(1950). Reluctant to admit African-Americans to its flagship
University of Texas Law School, the State set up a separate
school for Heman Sweatt and other black law students. Id.,
at 632. As originally opened, the new school had no independent faculty or library, and it lacked accreditation. Id.,
at 633. Nevertheless, the state trial and appellate courts
were satisfied that the new school offered Sweatt opportunities for the study of law "substantially equivalent to those
offered by the State to white students at the University of
Texas." Id., at 632 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Before this Court considered the case, the new school had
gained "a faculty of five full-time professors; a student body
of 23; a library of some 16,500 volumes serviced by a full-time
staff; a practice court and legal aid association; and one alumnus who ha[d] become a member of the Texas Bar." Id., at
633. This Court contrasted resources at the new school
with those at the school from which Sweatt had been excluded. The University of Texas Law School had a full-time
faculty of 16, a student body of 850, a library containing over

554 UNITED STATES v. VIRGINIA

Opinion of the Court
65,000 volumes, scholarship funds, a law review, and mootcourt facilities. Id., at 632-633.

More important than the tangible features, the Court em-phasized, are "those qualities which are incapable of objective measurement but which make for greatness" in a school,including "reputation of the faculty, experience of the administration, position and influence of the alumni, standing inthe community, traditions and prestige."

Id., at 634. Fac-ing the marked differences reported in the Sweatt opinion,

the Court unanimously ruled that Texas had not shown "sub-stantial equality in the [separate] educational opportunities"
the State offered. Id., at 633. Accordingly, the Court held,the Equal Protection Clause required Texas to admit AfricanAmericans to the University of Texas Law School. Id., at636. In line with

Sweatt, we rule here that Virginia hasnot shown substantial equality in the separate educational

opportunities the Commonwealth supports at VWIL andVMI.

C
When Virginia tendered its VWIL plan, the Fourth Circuitdid not inquire whether the proposed remedy, approved by

the District Court, placed women denied the VMI advantagein "the position they would have occupied in the absence of
[discrimination]." Milliken, 433 U. S., at 280 (internal quo-tation marks omitted). Instead, the Court of Appeals considered whether the Commonwealth could provide, with fi-delity to the equal protection principle, separate and unequal
educational programs for men and women.The Fourth Circuit acknowledged that "the VWIL degree
from Mary Baldwin College lacks the historical benefit andprestige of a degree from VMI." 44 F. 3d, at 1241. The
Court of Appeals further observed that VMI is "an ongoingand successful institution with a long history," and there remains no "comparable single-gender women's institution."
Ibid. Nevertheless, the appeals court declared the substan-tially different and significantly unequal VWIL program sat518us2$84P 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT

isfactory. The court reached that result by revising the ap-plicable standard of review. The Fourth Circuit displaced

the standard developed in our precedent, see supra, at 532-534, and substituted a standard of its own invention.

We have earlier described the deferential review in whichthe Court of Appeals engaged, see

supra, at 528-529, a brandof review inconsistent with the more exacting standard our

precedent requires, see supra, at 532-534. Quoting in partfrom Mississippi Univ. for Women, the Court of Appeals
candidly described its own analysis as one capable of check-ing a legislative purpose ranked as "pernicious," but generally according "deference to [the] legislative will." 44 F. 3d,at 1235, 1236. Recognizing that it had extracted from our
decisions a test yielding "little or no scrutiny of the effectof a classification directed at [single-gender education]," the
Court of Appeals devised another test, a "substantive com-parability" inquiry,

id., at 1237, and proceeded to find thatnew test satisfied, id., at 1241.

The Fourth Circuit plainly erred in exposing Virginia'sVWIL plan to a deferential analysis, for "all gender-based
classifications today" warrant "heightened scrutiny." See
J. E. B., 511 U. S., at 136. Valuable as VWIL may prove forstudents who seek the program offered, Virginia's remedy

affords no cure at all for the opportunities and advantageswithheld from women who want a VMI education and can
make the grade. See supra, at 549-554.20 In sum, Virginia's

20 Virginia's prime concern, it appears, is that "plac[ing] men and women
into the adversative relationship inherent in the VMI program . . . would
destroy, at least for that period of the adversative training, any sense of
decency that still permeates the relationship between the sexes." 44 F.
3d, at 1239; see supra, at 540-546. It is an ancient and familiar fear.

Eighth Circuit Judicial Conference, Colorado Springs, Colo., July 17, 1987)
(footnotes omitted):

"Plato questioned whether women should be afforded equal opportunity
to become guardians, those elite Rulers of Platonic society. Ironically, in
that most undemocratic system of government, the Republic, women's native ability to serve as guardians was not seriously questioned. The concern was over the wrestling and exercise class in which all candidates for
guardianship had to participate, for rigorous physical and mental training
were prerequisites to attain the exalted status of guardian. And in accord with Greek custom, those exercise classes were conducted in the
nude. Plato concluded that their virtue would clothe the women's nakedness and that Platonic society would not thereby be deprived of the talent
of qualified citizens for reasons of mere gender."

For Plato's full text on the equality of women, see 2 The Dialogues of Plato
302-312 (B. Jowett transl., 4th ed. 1953). Virginia, not bound to ancient
Greek custom in its "rigorous physical and mental training" programs,
could more readily make the accommodations necessary to draw on "the
talent of [all] qualified citizens." Cf. supra, at 550-551, n. 19.

[not paralleled in] other Virginia educational institutions."Ibid.

VMI, too, offers an educational opportunity no other Vir-ginia institution provides, and the school's "prestige"--associated with its success in developing "citizen-soldiers"--isunequaled. Virginia has closed this facility to its daughters
and, instead, has devised for them a "parallel program," witha faculty less impressively credentialed and less well paid,
more limited course offerings, fewer opportunities for mili-tary training and for scientific specialization. Cf.

Sweatt,339 U. S., at 633. VMI, beyond question, "possesses to a far

greater degree" than the VWIL program "those qualitieswhich are incapable of objective measurement but which
make for greatness in a . . . school," including "position
and influence of the alumni, standing in the community, tra-ditions and prestige."

Id., at 634. Women seeking and fit
for a VMI-quality education cannot be offered anything less,under the Commonwealth's obligation to afford them genuinely equal protection.A prime part of the history of our Constitution, historian
Richard Morris recounted, is the story of the extension of
constitutional rights and protections to people once ignoredor excluded.

21 VMI's story continued as our comprehension of "We the People" expanded. See supra, at 532, n. 6.

second President) John Adams, on the subject of qualifications for voting
in his home State:

"[I]t is dangerous to open so fruitful a source of controversy and altercation as would be opened by attempting to alter the qualifications of voters;
there will be no end of it. New claims will arise; women will demand a
vote; lads from twelve to twenty-one will think their rights not enough
attended to; and every man who has not a farthing, will demand an equal
voice with any other, in all acts of state. It tends to confound and destroy
all distinctions, and prostrate all ranks to one common level." Letter

It is so ordered.
Justice Thomas took no part in the consideration ordecision of these cases.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, concurring in the judgment.
The Court holds first that Virginia violates the Equal Pro-tection Clause by maintaining the Virginia Military Institute's (VMI's) all-male admissions policy, and second thatestablishing the Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership

analysis and so I write separately.

Two decades ago in Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 197(1976), we announced that "[t]o withstand constitutional challenge, . . . classifications by gender must serve importantgovernmental objectives and must be substantially related
to achievement of those objectives." We have adhered tothat standard of scrutiny ever since. See Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U. S. 199, 210-211 (1977); Califano v. Webster, 430U. S. 313, 316-317 (1977);

majority adheres to this test today, ante, at 524, 533, it alsosays that the Commonwealth must demonstrate an " `exceedingly persuasive justification' " to support a gender-basedclassification. See

ante, at 524, 529, 530, 531, 533, 534, 545,
546, 556. It is unfortunate that the Court thereby introduces
an element of uncertainty respecting the appropriate test.

While terms like "important governmental objective" and
"substantially related" are hardly models of precision, they
have more content and specificity than does the phrase "exceedingly persuasive justification." That phrase is best confined, as it was first used, as an observation on the difficulty
of meeting the applicable test, not as a formulation of the
test itself. See, e. g., Feeney, supra, at 273 ("[T]hese precedents dictate that any state law overtly or covertly designed
to prefer males over females in public employment require
an exceedingly persuasive justification"). To avoid introducing potential confusion, I would have adhered more
closely to our traditional, "firmly established," Hogan, supra,
at 723; Heckler, supra, at 744, standard that a gender-based
classification "must bear a close and substantial relationship
to important governmental objectives." Feeney, supra, at
273.

Our cases dealing with gender discrimination also require
that the proffered purpose for the challenged law be the
actual purpose. See ante, at 533, 535-536. It is on this
ground that the Court rejects the first of two justifications
Virginia offers for VMI's single-sex admissions policy,
namely, the goal of diversity among its public educational
institutions. While I ultimately agree that the Common518us2$84H 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT
560 UNITED STATES v. VIRGINIA

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment
wealth has not carried the day with this justification, I dis-agree with the Court's method of analyzing the issue.

VMI was founded in 1839, and, as the Court notes, ante,at 536-537, admission was limited to men because under the
then-prevailing view men, not women, were destined for
higher education. However misguided this point of viewmay be by present-day standards, it surely was not unconstitutional in 1839. The adoption of the Fourteenth Amend-ment, with its Equal Protection Clause, was nearly 30 years
in the future. The interpretation of the Equal ProtectionClause to require heightened scrutiny for gender discrimination was yet another century away.

Long after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment,
and well into this century, legal distinctions between men
and women were thought to raise no question under the
Equal Protection Clause. The Court refers to our decision
in Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U. S. 464 (1948). Likewise representing that now abandoned view was Hoyt v. Florida, 368
U. S. 57 (1961), where the Court upheld a Florida system of
jury selection in which men were automatically placed on
jury lists, but women were placed there only if they expressed an affirmative desire to serve. The Court noted
that despite advances in women's opportunities, the "woman
is still regarded as the center of home and family life." Id.,
at 62.

Then, in 1971, we decided Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71, which
the Court correctly refers to as a seminal case. But its facts
have nothing to do with admissions to any sort of educational
institution. An Idaho statute governing the administration
of estates and probate preferred men to women if the other
statutory qualifications were equal. The statute's purpose,
according to the Idaho Supreme Court, was to avoid hearings
to determine who was better qualified as between a man and
a woman both applying for letters of administration. This
Court held that such a rule violated the Fourteenth Amendment because "a mandatory preference to members of either

sex over members of the other, merely to accomplish theelimination of hearings," was an "arbitrary legislative choice

forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause." Id., at 76. Thebrief opinion in

Reed made no mention of either Goesaert
or Hoyt.

Even at the time of our decision in Reed v. Reed, therefore,Virginia and VMI were scarcely on notice that its holding

would be extended across the constitutional board. Theywere entitled to believe that "one swallow doesn't make a
summer" and await further developments. Those develop-ments were 11 years in coming. In

Mississippi Univ. for
Women v. Hogan, supra, a case actually involving a singlesex admissions policy in higher education, the Court held
that the exclusion of men from a nursing program violated
the Equal Protection Clause. This holding did place Virginia on notice that VMI's men-only admissions policy was
open to serious question.

The VMI Board of Visitors, in response, appointed a Mission Study Committee to examine "the legality and wisdom
of VMI's single-sex policy in light of " Hogan. 766 F. Supp.
1407, 1427 (WD Va. 1991). But the committee ended up
cryptically recommending against changing VMI's status as
a single-sex college. After three years of study, the committee found " `no information' " that would warrant a change in
VMI's status. Id., at 1429. Even the District Court, ultimately sympathetic to VMI's position, found that "[t]he Report provided very little indication of how [its] conclusion
was reached" and that "[t]he one and one-half pages in the
committee's final report devoted to analyzing the information
it obtained primarily focuses on anticipated difficulties in attracting females to VMI." Ibid. The reasons given in the
report for not changing the policy were the changes that
admission of women to VMI would require, and the likely
effect of those changes on the institution. That VMI would
have to change is simply not helpful in addressing the constitutionality of the status after Hogan.

562 UNITED STATES v. VIRGINIA

Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment
Before this Court, Virginia has sought to justify VMI'ssingle-sex admissions policy primarily on the basis that

diversity in education is desirable, and that while most ofthe public institutions of higher learning in the Commonwealth are coeducational, there should also be room forsingle-sex institutions. I agree with the Court that there
is scant evidence in the record that this was the real reasonthat Virginia decided to maintain VMI as men only.* But,
unlike the majority, I would consider only evidence thatpostdates our decision in

Hogan, and would draw no nega-tive inferences from the Commonwealth's actions before

that time. I think that after Hogan, the Commonwealthwas entitled to reconsider its policy with respect to VMI,
and not to have earlier justifications, or lack thereof, heldagainst it.

Even if diversity in educational opportunity were theCommonwealth's actual objective, the Commonwealth's
position would still be problematic. The difficulty with itsposition is that the diversity benefited only one sex; there
was single-sex public education available for men at VMI,but no corresponding single-sex public education available
for women. When Hogan placed Virginia on notice that

*The dissent equates our conclusion that VMI's "asserted interest in
promoting diversity" is not " `genuine,' " with a "charge" that the diversity
rationale is "a pretext for discriminating against women." Post, at 579-
580. Of course, those are not the same thing. I do not read the Court
as saying that the diversity rationale is a pretext for discrimination, and
I would not endorse such a proposition. We may find that diversity was
not the Commonwealth's real reason without suggesting, or having to
show, that the real reason was "antifeminism," post, at 580. Our cases
simply require that the proffered purpose for the challenged gender classification be the actual purpose, although not necessarily recorded. See
ante, at 533, 535-536. The dissent also says that the interest in diversity
is so transparent that having to articulate it is "absurd on its face." Post,
at 592. Apparently, that rationale was not obvious to the Mission Study
Committee which failed to list it among its reasons for maintaining VMI's
all-men admissions policy.

VMI's admissions policy possibly was unconstitutional, VMI
could have dealt with the problem by admitting women;
but its governing body felt strongly that the admission of
women would have seriously harmed the institution's educational approach. Was there something else the Commonwealth could have done to avoid an equal protection violation? Since the Commonwealth did nothing, we do not have
to definitively answer that question.

I do not think, however, that the Commonwealth's options
were as limited as the majority may imply. The Court cites,
without expressly approving it, a statement from the opinion
of the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals, to the effect
that the Commonwealth could have "simultaneously opened
single-gender undergraduate institutions having substantially comparable curricular and extra-curricular programs,
funding, physical plant, administration and support services,
and faculty and library resources." Ante, at 529-530 (internal quotation marks omitted). If this statement is thought to
exclude other possibilities, it is too stringent a requirement.
VMI had been in operation for over a century and a half, and
had an established, successful, and devoted group of alumni.
No legislative wand could instantly call into existence a
similar institution for women; and it would be a tremendous
loss to scrap VMI's history and tradition. In the words of
Grover Cleveland's second inaugural address, the Commonwealth faced a condition, not a theory. And it was a condition that had been brought about, not through defiance
of decisions construing gender bias under the Equal Protection Clause, but, until the decision in Hogan, a condition
that had not appeared to offend the Constitution. Had Virginia made a genuine effort to devote comparable public resources to a facility for women, and followed through on such
a plan, it might well have avoided an equal protection violation. I do not believe the Commonwealth was faced with
the stark choice of either admitting women to VMI, on the

one hand, or abandoning VMI and starting from scratch for
both men and women, on the other.

But, as I have noted, neither the governing board of VMI
nor the Commonwealth took any action after 1982. If diversity in the form of single-sex, as well as coeducational,
institutions of higher learning were to be available to Virginians, that diversity had to be available to women as well
as to men.

The dissent criticizes me for "disregarding the four allwomen's private colleges in Virginia (generously assisted by
public funds)." Post, at 595. The private women's colleges
are treated by the Commonwealth exactly as all other
private schools are treated, which includes the provision
of tuition-assistance grants to Virginia residents. Virginia
gives no special support to the women's single-sex education.
But obviously, the same is not true for men's education.
Had the Commonwealth provided the kind of support for the
private women's schools that it provides for VMI, this may
have been a very different case. For in so doing, the Commonwealth would have demonstrated that its interest in providing a single-sex education for men was to some measure
matched by an interest in providing the same opportunity
for women.

Virginia offers a second justification for the single-sex admissions policy: maintenance of the adversative method. I
agree with the Court that this justification does not serve an
important governmental objective. A State does not have
substantial interest in the adversative methodology unless
it is pedagogically beneficial. While considerable evidence
shows that a single-sex education is pedagogically beneficial
for some students, see 766 F. Supp., at 1414, and hence a
State may have a valid interest in promoting that methodology, there is no similar evidence in the record that an adversative method is pedagogically beneficial or is any more
likely to produce character traits than other methodologies.

The Court defines the constitutional violation in thesecases as "the categorical exclusion of women from an

extraordinary educational opportunity afforded to men."
Ante, at 547. By defining the violation in this way, and byemphasizing that a remedy for a constitutional violation

must place the victims of discrimination in " `the positionthey would have occupied in the absence of [discrimination],' " ibid., the Court necessarily implies that the only ade-quate remedy would be the admission of women to the allmale institution. As the foregoing discussion suggests, Iwould not define the violation in this way; it is not the "exclusion of women" that violates the Equal Protection Clause,but the maintenance of an all-men school without providing
any--much less a comparable--institution for women.Accordingly, the remedy should not necessarily require
either the admission of women to VMI or the creation of aVMI clone for women. An adequate remedy in my opinion
might be a demonstration by Virginia that its interest in edu-cating men in a single-sex environment is matched by its
interest in educating women in a single-sex institution. Todemonstrate such, the Commonwealth does not need to create two institutions with the same number of faculty Ph. D.'s,similar SAT scores, or comparable athletic fields. See

ante,at 551-552. Nor would it necessarily require that the

women's institution offer the same curriculum as the men's;one could be strong in computer science, the other could
be strong in liberal arts. It would be a sufficient remedy,I think, if the two institutions offered the same quality of
education and were of the same overall caliber.

If a State decides to create single-sex programs, the Statewould, I expect, consider the public's interest and demand

in designing curricula. And rightfully so. But the Stateshould avoid assuming demand based on stereotypes; it must
not assume a priori, without evidence, that there would be

Scalia, J., dissenting
no interest in a women's school of civil engineering, or ina men's school of nursing.

In the end, the women's institution Virginia proposes,VWIL, fails as a remedy, because it is distinctly inferior to
the existing men's institution and will continue to be for the
foreseeable future. VWIL simply is not, in any sense, theinstitution that VMI is. In particular, VWIL is a program

appended to a private college, not a self-standing institution;and VWIL is substantially underfunded as compared to
VMI. I therefore ultimately agree with the Court that Vir-ginia has not provided an adequate remedy.

Justice Scalia, dissenting.
Today the Court shuts down an institution that has servedthe people of the Commonwealth of Virginia with pride and

distinction for over a century and a half. To achieve that
desired result, it rejects (contrary to our established practice) the factual findings of two courts below, sweeps aside
the precedents of this Court, and ignores the history of our
people. As to facts: It explicitly rejects the finding that
there exist "gender-based developmental differences" supporting Virginia's restriction of the "adversative" method to
only a men's institution, and the finding that the all-male
composition of the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) is essential to that institution's character. As to precedent: It
drastically revises our established standards for reviewing
sex-based classifications. And as to history: It counts for
nothing the long tradition, enduring down to the present,
of men's military colleges supported by both States and the
Federal Government.

Much of the Court's opinion is devoted to deprecating the
closed-mindedness of our forebears with regard to women's
education, and even with regard to the treatment of women
in areas that have nothing to do with education. Closedminded they were--as every age is, including our own, with
regard to matters it cannot guess, because it simply does not

consider them debatable. The virtue of a democratic systemwith a First Amendment is that it readily enables the people,

over time, to be persuaded that what they took for grantedis not so, and to change their laws accordingly. That system
is destroyed if the smug assurances of each age are removedfrom the democratic process and written into the Constitution. So to counterbalance the Court's criticism of our an-cestors, let me say a word in their praise: They left us free
to change. The same cannot be said of this most illiberalCourt, which has embarked on a course of inscribing one
after another of the current preferences of the society (andin some cases only the countermajoritarian preferences of
the society's law-trained elite) into our Basic Law. Today itenshrines the notion that no substantial educational value is
to be served by an all-men's military academy--so that thedecision by the people of Virginia to maintain such an institution denies equal protection to women who cannot attendthat institution but can attend others. Since it is entirely
clear that the Constitution of the United States--the oldone--takes no sides in this educational debate, I dissent.

I
I shall devote most of my analysis to evaluating theCourt's opinion on the basis of our current equal protection

jurisprudence, which regards this Court as free to evaluateeverything under the sun by applying one of three tests: "rational basis" scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, or strict scru-tiny. These tests are no more scientific than their names
suggest, and a further element of randomness is added bythe fact that it is largely up to us which test will be applied
in each case. Strict scrutiny, we have said, is reserved forstate "classifications based on race or national origin and
classifications affecting fundamental rights," Clark v. Jeter,486 U. S. 456, 461 (1988) (citation omitted). It is my position
that the term "fundamental rights" should be limited to "in-terest[s] traditionally protected by our society," Michael H.

Scalia, J., dissenting
v. Gerald D., 491 U. S. 110, 122 (1989) (plurality opinion of
Scalia, J.); but the Court has not accepted that view, so that
strict scrutiny will be applied to the deprivation of whateversort of right we consider "fundamental." We have no established criterion for "intermediate scrutiny" either, but essentially apply it when it seems like a good idea to load the dice.So far it has been applied to content-neutral restrictions that

place an incidental burden on speech, to disabilities attendantto illegitimacy, and to discrimination on the basis of sex.
See, e. g., Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512U. S. 622, 662 (1994);

Mills v. Habluetzel, 456 U. S. 91, 98-99
(1982); Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 197 (1976).

I have no problem with a system of abstract tests such
as rational basis, intermediate, and strict scrutiny (though
I think we can do better than applying strict scrutiny
and intermediate scrutiny whenever we feel like it). Such
formulas are essential to evaluating whether the new restrictions that a changing society constantly imposes upon private conduct comport with that "equal protection" our society has always accorded in the past. But in my view the
function of this Court is to preserve our society's values regarding (among other things) equal protection, not to revise
them; to prevent backsliding from the degree of restriction
the Constitution imposed upon democratic government, not
to prescribe, on our own authority, progressively higher degrees. For that reason it is my view that, whatever abstract
tests we may choose to devise, they cannot supersede--and
indeed ought to be crafted so as to reflect--those constant
and unbroken national traditions that embody the people's
understanding of ambiguous constitutional texts. More specifically, it is my view that "when a practice not expressly
prohibited by the text of the Bill of Rights bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use that dates back to the beginning of the Republic,
we have no proper basis for striking it down." Rutan v.
Republican Party of Ill., 497 U. S. 62, 95 (1990) (Scalia, J.,

dissenting). The same applies, mutatis mutandis, to a prac-tice asserted to be in violation of the post-Civil War Fourteenth Amendment. See, e. g., Burnham v. Superior Court
of Cal., County of Marin, 495 U. S. 604 (1990) (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.) (Due Process Clause); J. E. B. v. Alabama
ex rel. T. B., 511 U. S. 127, 156-163 (1994) (Scalia, J., dissent-ing) (Equal Protection Clause);

Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 979-984, 1000-1001(1992) (

Scalia, J., dissenting) (various alleged "penumbras").
The all-male constitution of VMI comes squarely withinsuch a governing tradition. Founded by the Commonwealth

of Virginia in 1839 and continuously maintained by it since,
VMI has always admitted only men. And in that regard it
has not been unusual. For almost all of VMI's more than a
century and a half of existence, its single-sex status reflected
the uniform practice for government-supported military colleges. Another famous Southern institution, The Citadel,
has existed as a state-funded school of South Carolina since
1842. And all the federal military colleges--West Point,
the Naval Academy at Annapolis, and even the Air Force
Academy, which was not established until 1954--admitted
only males for most of their history. Their admission of
women in 1976 (upon which the Court today relies, see
ante, at 544-545, nn. 13, 15) came not by court decree, but
because the people, through their elected representatives,
decreed a change. See, e. g., $ 803(a), 89 Stat. 537, note
following 10 U. S. C. $ 4342. In other words, the tradition
of having government-funded military schools for men is as
well rooted in the traditions of this country as the tradition
of sending only men into military combat. The people may
decide to change the one tradition, like the other, through
democratic processes; but the assertion that either tradition
has been unconstitutional through the centuries is not law,
but politics-smuggled-into-law.

And the same applies, more broadly, to single-sex education in general, which, as I shall discuss, is threatened by

today's decision with the cutoff of all state and federal sup-port. Government-run nonmilitary educational institutions

for the two sexes have until very recently also been partof our national tradition. "[It is] [c]oeducation, historically,
[that] is a novel educational theory. From grade schoolthrough high school, college, and graduate and professional
training, much of the Nation's population during much of ourhistory has been educated in sexually segregated classrooms." Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S.718, 736 (1982) (Powell, J., dissenting); see

id., at 736-739.These traditions may of course be changed by the democratic

decisions of the people, as they largely have been.Today, however, change is forced upon Virginia, and reversion to single-sex education is prohibited nationwide, not bydemocratic processes but by order of this Court. Even while
bemoaning the sorry, bygone days of "fixed notions" concern-ing women's education, see

ante, at 536-537, and n. 10, 537-539, 542-544, the Court favors current notions so fixedly that

it is willing to write them into the Constitution of the UnitedStates by application of custom-built "tests." This is not
the interpretation of a Constitution, but the creation of one.

II
To reject the Court's disposition today, however, it is notnecessary to accept my view that the Court's made-up tests

cannot displace longstanding national traditions as the pri-mary determinant of what the Constitution means. It is
only necessary to apply honestly the test the Court has beenapplying to sex-based classifications for the past two decades. It is well settled, as Justice O'Connor stated sometime ago for a unanimous Court, that we evaluate a statutory
classification based on sex under a standard that lies "[b]e-tween th[e] extremes of rational basis review and strict scrutiny." Clark v. Jeter, 486 U. S., at 461. We have denomi-nated this standard "intermediate scrutiny" and under it
have inquired whether the statutory classification is "sub518us2$84K 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT

stantially related to an important governmental objective."
Ibid. See, e. g., Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U. S. 728, 744
(1984); Wengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co., 446 U. S. 142, 150(1980);

Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S., at 197.
Before I proceed to apply this standard to VMI, I must
comment upon the manner in which the Court avoids doingso. Notwithstanding our above-described precedents and

their " `firmly established principles,' " Heckler, supra, at 744(quoting

Hogan, supra, at 723), the United States urged us
to hold in this litigation "that strict scrutiny is the correctconstitutional standard for evaluating classifications that

deny opportunities to individuals based on their sex." Brief
for United States in No. 94-2107, p. 16. (This was in flat
contradiction of the Government's position below, which
was, in its own words, to "stat[e] unequivocally that the appropriate standard in this case is `intermediate scrutiny.' "
2 Record, Doc. No. 88, p. 3 (emphasis added).) The Court,
while making no reference to the Government's argument,
effectively accepts it.

Although the Court in two places recites the test as stated
in Hogan, see ante, at 524, 532-533, which asks whether the
State has demonstrated "that the classification serves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory
means employed are substantially related to the achievement
of those objectives," 458 U. S., at 724 (internal quotation
marks omitted), the Court never answers the question presented in anything resembling that form. When it engages
in analysis, the Court instead prefers the phrase "exceedingly persuasive justification" from Hogan. The Court's
nine invocations of that phrase, see ante, at 524, 529, 530,
531, 533, 534, 545, 546, 556, and even its fanciful description of that imponderable as "the core instruction" of the
Court's decisions in J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B., supra,
and Hogan, supra, see ante, at 531, would be unobjectionable if the Court acknowledged that whether a "justification"
is "exceedingly persuasive" must be assessed by asking

572 UNITED STATES v. VIRGINIA

Scalia, J., dissenting
"[whether] the classification serves important governmentalobjectives and [whether] the discriminatory means employed

are substantially related to the achievement of those objec-tives." Instead, however, the Court proceeds to interpret
"exceedingly persuasive justification" in a fashion that con-tradicts the reasoning of

Hogan and our other precedents.That is essential to the Court's result, which can only be

achieved by establishing that intermediate scrutiny is notsurvived if there are some women interested in attending
VMI, capable of undertaking its activities, and able to meetits physical demands. Thus, the Court summarizes its holding as follows:

"In contrast to the generalizations about women onwhich Virginia rests, we note again these

dispositive re-alities: VMI's implementing methodology is not

inher-ently unsuitable to women; some women do well under

the adversative model; some women, at least, wouldwant to attend VMI if they had the opportunity; some
women are capable of all of the individual activities re-quired of VMI cadets and can meet the physical standards VMI now imposes on men." Ante, at 550 (internalquotation marks, citations, and punctuation omitted; emphasis added).
Similarly, the Court states that "[t]he Commonwealth's justi-fication for excluding all women from `citizen-soldier' training for which some are qualified . . . cannot rank as `exceed-ingly persuasive' . . . ." Ante, at 545.

Scalia, J., dissenting
Only the amorphous "exceedingly persuasive justification"phrase, and not the standard elaboration of intermediate

scrutiny, can be made to yield this conclusion that VMI'ssingle-sex composition is unconstitutional because there
exist several women (or, one would have to conclude underthe Court's reasoning, a single woman) willing and able
to undertake VMI's program. Intermediate scrutiny hasnever required a least-restrictive-means analysis, but only a
"substantial relation" between the classification and the stateinterests that it serves. Thus, in

Califano v. Webster, 430U. S. 313 (1977) (per curiam), we upheld a congressional

statute that provided higher Social Security benefits forwomen than for men. We reasoned that "women . . . as such
have been unfairly hindered from earning as much as men,"but we did not require proof that each woman so benefited
had suffered discrimination or that each disadvantaged manhad not; it was sufficient that even under the former congressional scheme "women on the average received lower retire-ment benefits than men."

Id., at 318, and n. 5 (emphasisadded). The reasoning in our other intermediate-scrutiny

cases has similarly required only a substantial relation be-tween end and means, not a perfect fit. In

Rostker v. Gold-berg, 453 U. S. 57 (1981), we held that selective-service registration could constitutionally exclude women, because even"assuming that a small number of women could be drafted
for noncombat roles, Congress simply did not consider itworth the added burdens of including women in draft and
registration plans." Id., at 81. In Metro Broadcasting,
Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 579, 582-583 (1990), overruled onother grounds, Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pen

~ a, 515 U. S.200, 227 (1995), we held that a classification need not

be accurate "in every case" to survive intermediate scrutinyso long as, "in the aggregate," it advances the underlying

objective. There is simply no support in our cases for thenotion that a sex-based classification is invalid unless it relates to characteristics that hold true in every instance.Not content to execute a

de facto abandonment of the intermediate scrutiny that has been our standard for sex-based
classifications for some two decades, the Court purports toreserve the question whether, even in principle, a higher

standard (i. e., strict scrutiny) should apply. "The Courthas," it says, "

thus far reserved most stringent judicial scrutiny for classifications based on race or national origin . . . ,"
ante, at 532, n. 6 (emphasis added); and it describes our earlier cases as having done no more than decline to "equat[e]
gender classifications, for all purposes, to classifications
based on race or national origin," ante, at 532 (emphasis
added). The wonderful thing about these statements is that
they are not actually false--just as it would not be actually
false to say that "our cases have thus far reserved the `beyond a reasonable doubt' standard of proof for criminal
cases," or that "we have not equated tort actions, for all purposes, to criminal prosecutions." But the statements are
misleading, insofar as they suggest that we have not already
categorically held strict scrutiny to be inapplicable to sexbased classifications. See, e. g., Heckler v. Mathews, 465
U. S. 728 (1984) (upholding state action after applying only
intermediate scrutiny); Michael M. v. Superior Court, Somoma Cty., 450 U. S. 464 (1981) (plurality and both concurring opinions) (same); Califano v. Webster, supra (per curiam) (same). And the statements are irresponsible, insofar
as they are calculated to destabilize current law. Our task
is to clarify the law--not to muddy the waters, and not to
exact overcompliance by intimidation. The States and the
Federal Government are entitled to know before they act the
standard to which they will be held, rather than be compelled
to guess about the outcome of Supreme Court peek-a-boo.

The Court's intimations are particularly out of place because it is perfectly clear that, if the question of the applica518us2$84K 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT

Scalia, J., dissenting
ble standard of review for sex-based classifications were to
be regarded as an appropriate subject for reconsideration,
the stronger argument would be not for elevating the standard to strict scrutiny, but for reducing it to rational-basis
review. The latter certainly has a firmer foundation in our
past jurisprudence: Whereas no majority of the Court has
ever applied strict scrutiny in a case involving sex-based
classifications, we routinely applied rational-basis review
until the 1970's, see, e. g., Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U. S. 57 (1961);
Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U. S. 464 (1948). And of course normal, rational-basis review of sex-based classifications would
be much more in accord with the genesis of heightened
standards of judicial review, the famous footnote in United
States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144 (1938), which
said (intimatingly) that we did not have to inquire in the case
at hand

"whether prejudice against discrete and insular minorities may be a special condition, which tends seriously to
curtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities, and which
may call for a correspondingly more searching judicial
inquiry." Id., at 152-153, n. 4.

It is hard to consider women a "discrete and insular minorit[y]" unable to employ the "political processes ordinarily to
be relied upon," when they constitute a majority of the electorate. And the suggestion that they are incapable of exerting that political power smacks of the same paternalism that
the Court so roundly condemns. See, e. g., ante, at 536-537,
542-546 (and accompanying notes). Moreover, a long list of
legislation proves the proposition false. See, e. g., Equal
Pay Act of 1963, 29 U. S. C. $ 206(d); Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2; Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U. S. C. $ 1681; Women's Business Ownership Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-533, 102 Stat. 2689;

With this explanation of how the Court has succeeded inmaking its analysis seem orthodox--and indeed, if intimations are to be believed, even overly generous to VMI--Inow proceed to describe how the analysis should have been
conducted. The question to be answered, I repeat, iswhether the exclusion of women from VMI is "substantially
related to an important governmental objective."

A
It is beyond question that Virginia has an important stateinterest in providing effective college education for its citizens. That single-sex instruction is an approach substan-tially related to that interest should be evident enough from
the long and continuing history in this country of men's andwomen's colleges. But beyond that, as the Court of Appeals
here stated: "That single-gender education at the collegelevel is beneficial to both sexes is a fact established in this
case." 44 F. 3d 1229, 1238 (CA4 1995) (emphasis added).The evidence establishing that fact was overwhelming--
indeed, "virtually uncontradicted" in the words of the courtthat received the evidence, 766 F. Supp. 1407, 1415 (WD Va.
1991). As an initial matter, Virginia demonstrated at trialthat "[a] substantial body of contemporary scholarship and
research supports the proposition that, although males andfemales have significant areas of developmental overlap, they
also have differing developmental needs that are deep-seated." Id., at 1434. While no one questioned that for
many students a coeducational environment was nonethelessnot inappropriate, that could not obscure the demonstrated
benefits of single-sex colleges. For example, the DistrictCourt stated as follows:

"One empirical study in evidence, not questioned byany expert, demonstrates that single-sex colleges pro518us2$84K 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT

Scalia, J., dissenting
vide better educational experiences than coeducationalinstitutions. Students of both sexes become more

academically involved, interact with faculty frequently,show larger increases in intellectual self-esteem and are
more satisfied with practically all aspects of college ex-perience (the sole exception is social life) compared with
their counterparts in coeducational institutions. At-tendance at an all-male college substantially increases
the likelihood that a student will carry out career plansin law, business and college teaching, and also has a substantial positive effect on starting salaries in business.Women's colleges increase the chances that those who
attend will obtain positions of leadership, complete thebaccalaureate degree, and aspire to higher degrees."
Id., at 1412.
See also id., at 1434-1435 (factual findings). "[I]n the lightof this very substantial authority favoring single-sex education," the District Court concluded that "the VMI Board'sdecision to maintain an all-male institution is fully justified
even without taking into consideration the other unique fea-tures of VMI's teaching and training."

Id., at 1412. Thisfinding alone, which even this Court cannot dispute, see ante,

at 535, should be sufficient to demonstrate the constitutional-ity of VMI's all-male composition.

But besides its single-sex constitution, VMI is differentfrom other colleges in another way. It employs a "distinctive educational method," sometimes referred to as the "ad-versative, or doubting, model of education." 766 F. Supp.,
at 1413, 1421. "Physical rigor, mental stress, absoluteequality of treatment, absence of privacy, minute regulation
of behavior, and indoctrination in desirable values are thesalient attributes of the VMI educational experience." Id.,
at 1421. No one contends that this method is appropriatefor all individuals; education is not a "one size fits all" business. Just as a State may wish to support junior colleges,vocational institutes, or a law school that emphasizes case

578 UNITED STATES v. VIRGINIA

Scalia, J., dissenting
practice instead of classroom study, so too a State's decisionto maintain within its system one school that provides the

adversative method is "substantially related" to its goal ofgood education. Moreover, it was uncontested that "if the
state were to establish a women's VMI-type [i. e., adversative] program, the program would attract an insufficientnumber of participants to make the program work," 44 F. 3d,

at 1241; and it was found by the District Court that if Vir-ginia were to include women in VMI, the school "would eventually find it necessary to drop the adversative system alto-gether," 766 F. Supp., at 1413. Thus, Virginia's options were
an adversative method that excludes women or no adversative method at all.

There can be no serious dispute that, as the District Court
found, single-sex education and a distinctive educational
method "represent legitimate contributions to diversity in
the Virginia higher education system." Ibid. As a theoretical matter, Virginia's educational interest would have
been best served (insofar as the two factors we have mentioned are concerned) by six different types of public colleges--an all-men's, an all-women's, and a coeducational
college run in the "adversative method," and an all-men's,
an all-women's, and a coeducational college run in the "traditional method." But as a practical matter, of course, Virginia's financial resources, like any State's, are not limitless,
and the Commonwealth must select among the available
options. Virginia thus has decided to fund, in addition to
some 14 coeducational 4-year colleges, one college that is run
as an all-male school on the adversative model: the Virginia
Military Institute.

Virginia did not make this determination regarding the
make-up of its public college system on the unrealistic assumption that no other colleges exist. Substantial evidence
in the District Court demonstrated that the Commonwealth
has long proceeded on the principle that " `[h]igher education
resources should be viewed as a whole--public and pri518us2$84K 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT

vate' "--because such an approach enhances diversity andbecause " `it is academic and economic waste to permit

unwarranted duplication.' " Id., at 1420-1421 (quoting 1974Report of the General Assembly Commission on Higher
Education to the General Assembly of Virginia). It is thussignificant that, whereas there are "four all-female private
[colleges] in Virginia," there is only "one private all-male col-lege," which "indicates that the private sector is providing
for th[e] [former] form of education to a much greater extentthat it provides for all-male education." 766 F. Supp., at
1420-1421. In these circumstances, Virginia's election tofund one public all-male institution and one on the adversative model--and to concentrate its resources in a single en-tity that serves both these interests in diversity--is substantially related to the Commonwealth's important educationalinterests.

B
The Court today has no adequate response to this cleardemonstration of the conclusion produced by application of

intermediate scrutiny. Rather, it relies on a series of con-tentions that are irrelevant or erroneous as a matter of law,
foreclosed by the record in this litigation, or both.1. I have already pointed out the Court's most fundamental error, which is its reasoning that VMI's all-male composi-tion is unconstitutional because "some women are capable of
all of the individual activities required of VMI cadets," 766F. Supp., at 1412, and would prefer military training on the
adversative model. See supra, at 571-574. This unac-knowledged adoption of what amounts to (at least) strict
scrutiny is without antecedent in our sex-discriminationcases and by itself discredits the Court's decision.

2. The Court suggests that Virginia's claimed purpose inmaintaining VMI as an all-male institution--its asserted interest in promoting diversity of educational options--is not"genuin[e]," but is a pretext for discriminating against
women. Ante, at 539; see ante, at 535-540. To support this

580 UNITED STATES v. VIRGINIA

Scalia, J., dissenting
charge, the Court would have to impute that base motive toVMI's Mission Study Committee, which conducted a 3-year

study from 1983 to 1986 and recommended to VMI's Boardof Visitors that the school remain all male. The committee,
a majority of whose members consisted of non-VMI graduates, "read materials on education and on women in the mili-tary," "made site visits to single-sex and newly coeducational

institutions" including West Point and the Naval Academy,and "considered the reasons that other institutions had
changed from single-sex to coeducational status"; its workwas praised as "thorough" in the accreditation review of
VMI conducted by the Southern Association of Colleges and
Schools. See 766 F. Supp., at 1413, 1428; see also id.,
at 1427-1430 (detailed findings of fact concerning the Mission Study Committee). The Court states that "[w]hatever
internal purpose the Mission Study Committee served--
and however well meaning the framers of the report--we
can hardly extract from that effort any commonwealth policy evenhandedly to advance diverse educational options."
Ante, at 539. But whether it is part of the evidence to prove
that diversity was the Commonwealth's objective (its short
report said nothing on that particular subject) is quite separate from whether it is part of the evidence to prove that
antifeminism was not. The relevance of the Mission Study
Committee is that its very creation, its sober 3-year study,
and the analysis it produced utterly refute the claim that
VMI has elected to maintain its all-male student-body composition for some misogynistic reason.

The Court also supports its analysis of Virginia's "actual
state purposes" in maintaining VMI's student body as all
male by stating that there is no explicit statement in the
record " `in which the Commonwealth has expressed itself ' "
concerning those purposes. Ante, at 535, 539 (quoting 976
F. 2d 890, 899 (CA4 1992)); see also ante, at 525. That is
wrong on numerous grounds. First and foremost, in its implication that such an explicit statement of "actual purposes"

581Cite as: 518 U. S. 515 (1996)
Scalia, J., dissenting
is needed. The Court adopts, in effect, the argument of theUnited States that since the exclusion of women from VMI

in 1839 was based on the "assumptions" of the time "thatmen alone were fit for military and leadership roles," and
since "[b]efore this litigation was initiated, Virginia never
sought to supply a valid, contemporary rationale for VMI'sexclusionary policy," "[t]hat failure itself renders the VMI

policy invalid." Brief for United States in No. 94-2107, at10. This is an unheard-of doctrine. Each state decision to
adopt or maintain a governmental policy need not be accom-panied--in anticipation of litigation and on pain of being
found to lack a relevant state interest--by a lawyer's contemporaneous recitation of the State's purposes. The Constitution is not some giant Administrative Procedure Act,
which imposes upon the States the obligation to set forth a
"statement of basis and purpose" for their sovereign Acts,
see 5 U. S. C. $ 553(c). The situation would be different if
what the Court assumes to have been the 1839 policy had
been enshrined and remained enshrined in legislation--a
VMI charter, perhaps, pronouncing that the institution's purpose is to keep women in their place. But since the 1839
policy was no more explicitly recorded than the Court contends the present one is, the mere fact that today's Commonwealth continues to fund VMI "is enough to answer [the
United States'] contention that the [classification] was the
`accidental by-product of a traditional way of thinking about
females.' " Michael M., 450 U. S., at 471, n. 6 (plurality opinion) (quoting Califano v. Webster, 430 U. S., at 320) (internal
quotation marks omitted).

It is, moreover, not true that Virginia's contemporary reasons for maintaining VMI are not explicitly recorded. It is
hard to imagine a more authoritative source on this subject
than the 1990 Report of the Virginia Commission on the University of the 21st Century (1990 Report). As the parties
stipulated, that report "notes that the hallmarks of Virginia's
educational policy are `diversity and autonomy.' " Stipula518us2$84K 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT

tions of Fact 37, reprinted in Lodged Materials from theRecord 64 (Lodged Materials). It said: "The formal system

of higher education in Virginia includes a great array of in-stitutions: state-supported and independent, two-year and
senior, research and highly specialized, traditionally black
and single-sex." 1990 Report, quoted in relevant part atLodged Materials 64-65 (emphasis added).

2 The Court's

only response to this is repeated reliance on the Court ofAppeals' assertion that " `the only explicit [statement] that

we have found in the record in which the Commonwealthhas expressed itself with respect to gender distinctions' "
(namely, the statement in the 1990 Report that the Common-wealth's institutions must "deal with faculty, staff, and students without regard to sex") had nothing to do with thepurpose of diversity.

Ante, at 525, 539 (quoting 976 F. 2d,at 899). This proves, I suppose, that the Court of Appeals

did not find a statement dealing with sex and diversity inthe record; but the pertinent question (accepting the need
for such a statement) is whether it was there. And the plainfact, which the Court does not deny, is that it was.

2 This statement is supported by other evidence in the record demonstrating, by reference to both public and private institutions, that Virginia
actively seeks to foster its " `rich heritage of pluralism and diversity in
higher education,' " 1969 Report of the Virginia Commission on Constitutional Revision, quoted in relevant part at Lodged Materials 53; that Virginia views " `[o]ne special characteristic of the Virginia system [as being]
its diversity,' " 1989 Virginia Plan for Higher Education, quoted in relevant
part at Lodged Materials 64; and that in the Commonwealth's view
"[h]igher education resources should be viewed as a whole--public and
private"--because " `Virginia needs the diversity inherent in a dual system
of higher education,' " 1974 Report of the General Assembly Commission
on Higher Education to the General Assembly of Virginia, quoted in 766
F. Supp. 1407, 1420 (WD Va. 1991). See also Budget Initiatives for 1990-
1992 of State Council of Higher Education for Virginia 10 (June 21, 1989)
(Budget Initiatives), quoted at n. 3, infra. It should be noted (for this
point will be crucial to my later discussion) that these official reports
quoted here, in text and footnote, regard the Commonwealth's educational
system--public and private--as a unitary one.

The Court contends that "[a] purpose genuinely to advancean array of educational options . . . is not served" by VMI.

Ante, at 539-540. It relies on the fact that all of Virginia'sother public colleges have become coeducational. Ibid.; see
also ante, at 521, n. 2. The apparent theory of this argu-ment is that unless Virginia pursues a great deal of diversity,
its pursuit of some diversity must be a sham. This fails totake account of the fact that Virginia's resources cannot support all possible permutations of schools, see supra, at 578,and of the fact that Virginia coordinates its public educational offerings with the offerings of in-state private educa-tional institutions that the Commonwealth provides money
for its residents to attend and otherwise assists--which in-clude four women's colleges.

3

Finally, the Court unreasonably suggests that there issome pretext in Virginia's reliance upon decentralized deci3 The Commonwealth provides tuition assistance, scholarship grants,
guaranteed loans, and work-study funds for residents of Virginia who attend private colleges in the Commonwealth. See, e. g., Va. Code Ann.

$$ 23-38.11 to 23-38.19 (1993 and Supp. 1995) (Tuition Assistance Grant
Act); $$ 23-38.30 to 23-38.44:3 (Virginia Student Assistance Authorities);
Va. Code Ann. $$ 23-38.45 to 23-38.53 (1993) (College Scholarship Assistance Act); $$ 23-38.53:1 to 23-38.53:3 (Virginia Scholars Program); $$ 23-
38.70, 23-38.71 (Virginia Work-Study Program). These programs involve
substantial expenditures: for example, Virginia appropriated $4,413,750
(not counting federal funds it also earmarked) for the College Scholarship
Assistance Program for both 1996 and 1997, and for the Tuition Assistance
Grant Program appropriated $21,568,000 for 1996 and $25,842,000 for 1997.
See 1996 Va. Appropriations Act, ch. 912, pt. 1, $ 160.

In addition, as the parties stipulated in the District Court, the Commonwealth provides other financial support and assistance to private institutions--including single-sex colleges--through low-cost building loans,
state-funded services contracts, and other programs. See, e. g., Va. Code
Ann. $$ 23-30.39 to 23.30.58 (1993) (Educational Facilities Authority Act).
The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, in a 1989 document
not created for purposes of this litigation but introduced into evidence,
has described these various programs as a "means by which the Commonwealth can provide funding to its independent institutions, thereby helping
to maintain a diverse system of higher education." Budget Initiatives 10.

sionmaking to achieve diversity--its granting of substantialautonomy to each institution with regard to student-body

composition and other matters, see 766 F. Supp., at 1419.The Court adopts the suggestion of the Court of Appeals
that it is not possible for "one institution with autonomy, butwith no authority over any other state institution, [to] give
effect to a state policy of diversity among institutions."
Ante, at 539 (internal quotation marks omitted). If it wereimpossible for individual human beings (or groups of human

beings) to act autonomously in effective pursuit of a commongoal, the game of soccer would not exist. And where the
goal is diversity in a free market for services, that tends tobe achieved even by autonomous actors who act out of
entirely selfish interests and make no effort to cooperate.Each Virginia institution, that is to say, has a natural incentive to make itself distinctive in order to attract a particularsegment of student applicants. And of course none of the
institutions is entirely autonomous; if and when the legisla-ture decides that a particular school is not well serving the
interest of diversity--if it decides, for example, that a men'sschool is not much needed--funding will cease.

4 The Court, unfamiliar with the Commonwealth's policy of diverse and
independent institutions, and in any event careless of state and local traditions, must be forgiven by Virginians for quoting a reference to " `the
Charlottesville campus' " of the University of Virginia. See ante, at 538.
The University of Virginia, an institution even older than VMI, though
not as old as another of the Commonwealth's universities, the College of
William and Mary, occupies the portion of Charlottesville known, not as
the "campus," but as "the grounds." More importantly, even if it were a
"campus," there would be no need to specify "the Charlottesville campus,"
as one might refer to the Bloomington or Indianapolis campus of Indiana
University. Unlike university systems with which the Court is perhaps
more familiar, such as those in New York (e. g., the State University of
New York at Binghamton or Buffalo), Illinois (University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign or at Chicago), and California (University of California, Los Angeles, or University of California, Berkeley), there is only one
University of Virginia. It happens (because Thomas Jefferson lived near
there) to be located at Charlottesville. To many Virginians it is known,

3. In addition to disparaging Virginia's claim that VMI's
single-sex status serves a state interest in diversity, the
Court finds fault with Virginia's failure to offer education
based on the adversative training method to women. It dismisses the District Court's " `findings' on `gender-based developmental differences' " on the ground that "[t]hese `findings' restate the opinions of Virginia's expert witnesses,
opinions about typically male or typically female `tendencies.' " Ante, at 541 (quoting 766 F. Supp., at 1434-1435).
How remarkable to criticize the District Court on the ground
that its findings rest on the evidence (i. e., the testimony of
Virginia's witnesses)! That is what findings are supposed to
do. It is indefensible to tell the Commonwealth that "[t]he
burden of justification is demanding and it rests entirely on
[you]," ante, at 533, and then to ignore the District Court's
findings because they rest on the evidence put forward by
the Commonwealth--particularly when, as the District
Court said, "[t]he evidence in the case . . . is virtually uncontradicted," 766 F. Supp., at 1415 (emphasis added).

Ultimately, in fact, the Court does not deny the evidence
supporting these findings. See ante, at 541-546. It instead
makes evident that the parties to this litigation could have
saved themselves a great deal of time, trouble, and expense
by omitting a trial. The Court simply dispenses with the
evidence submitted at trial--it never says that a single finding of the District Court is clearly erroneous--in favor of the
Justices' own view of the world, which the Court proceeds
to support with (1) references to observations of someone

simply, as "the University," which suffices to distinguish it from the Commonwealth's other institutions offering 4-year college instruction, which
include Christopher Newport College, Clinch Valley College, the College
of William and Mary, George Mason University, James Madison University,
Longwood College, Mary Washington University, Norfolk State University, Old Dominion University, Radford University, Virginia Commonwealth University, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,
Virginia State University--and, of course, VMI.

who is not a witness, nor even an educational expert, nor
even a judge who reviewed the record or participated in the
judgment below, but rather a judge who merely dissented
from the Court of Appeals' decision not to rehear this litigation en banc, see ante, at 542, (2) citations of nonevidentiary
materials such as amicus curiae briefs filed in this Court,
see ante, at 544-545, nn. 13, 14, and (3) various historical
anecdotes designed to demonstrate that Virginia's support
for VMI as currently constituted reminds the Justices of the
"bad old days," see ante, at 542-544.

It is not too much to say that this approach to the litigation
has rendered the trial a sham. But treating the evidence as
irrelevant is absolutely necessary for the Court to reach its
conclusion. Not a single witness contested, for example,
Virginia's "substantial body of `exceedingly persuasive' evidence . . . that some students, both male and female, benefit
from attending a single-sex college" and "[that] [f]or those
students, the opportunity to attend a single-sex college is a
valuable one, likely to lead to better academic and professional achievement." 766 F. Supp., at 1411-1412. Even the
United States' expert witness "called himself a `believer in
single-sex education,' " although it was his "personal, philosophical preference," not one "born of educational-benefit
considerations," "that single-sex education should be provided only by the private sector." Id., at 1412.

4. The Court contends that Virginia, and the District
Court, erred, and "misperceived our precedent," by "train[ing] their argument on `means' rather than `end,' " ante,
at 545. The Court focuses on "VMI's mission," which is to
produce individuals "imbued with love of learning, confident
in the functions and attitudes of leadership, possessing a high
sense of public service, advocates of the American democracy
and free enterprise system, and ready . . . to defend their
country in time of national peril." 766 F. Supp., at 1425
(quoting Mission Study Committee of the VMI Board of

Scalia, J., dissenting
Visitors, Report, May 16, 1986). "Surely," the Court says,
"that goal is great enough to accommodate women." Ante,
at 545.

This is lawmaking by indirection. What the Court describes as "VMI's mission" is no less the mission of all Virginia colleges. Which of them would the Old Dominion
continue to fund if they did not aim to create individuals
"imbued with love of learning, etc.," right down to being
ready "to defend their country in time of national peril"? It
can be summed up as "learning, leadership, and patriotism."
To be sure, those general educational values are described
in a particularly martial fashion in VMI's mission statement,
in accordance with the military, adversative, and all-male
character of the institution. But imparting those values in
that fashion--i. e., in a military, adversative, all-male environment--is the distinctive mission of VMI. And as I have
discussed (and both courts below found), that mission is not
"great enough to accommodate women."

The Court's analysis at least has the benefit of producing
foreseeable results. Applied generally, it means that whenever a State's ultimate objective is "great enough to accommodate women" (as it always will be), then the State will be
held to have violated the Equal Protection Clause if it restricts to men even one means by which it pursues that objective--no matter how few women are interested in pursuing the objective by that means, no matter how much the
single-sex program will have to be changed if both sexes
are admitted, and no matter how beneficial that program has
theretofore been to its participants.

5. The Court argues that VMI would not have to change
very much if it were to admit women. See, e. g., ante, at
540-542. The principal response to that argument is that it is
irrelevant: If VMI's single-sex status is substantially related
to the government's important educational objectives, as I
have demonstrated above and as the Court refuses to dis518us2$84K 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT
588 UNITED STATES v. VIRGINIA

Scalia, J., dissenting
cuss, that concludes the inquiry. There should be no debate
in the federal judiciary over "how much" VMI would be required to change if it admitted women and whether that
would constitute "too much" change.

But if such a debate were relevant, the Court would certainly be on the losing side. The District Court found as
follows: "[T]he evidence establishes that key elements of the
adversative VMI educational system, with its focus on barracks life, would be fundamentally altered, and the distinctive ends of the system would be thwarted, if VMI were
forced to admit females and to make changes necessary to
accommodate their needs and interests." 766 F. Supp., at
1411. Changes that the District Court's detailed analysis
found would be required include new allowances for personal
privacy in the barracks, such as locked doors and coverings
on windows, which would detract from VMI's approach of
regulating minute details of student behavior, "contradict
the principle that everyone is constantly subject to scrutiny
by everyone else," and impair VMI's "total egalitarian approach" under which every student must be "treated alike";
changes in the physical training program, which would reduce "[t]he intensity and aggressiveness of the current program"; and various modifications in other respects of the
adversative training program that permeates student life.
See id., at 1412-1413, 1435-1443. As the Court of Appeals
summarized it, "the record supports the district court's findings that at least these three aspects of VMI's program--
physical training, the absence of privacy, and the adversative
approach--would be materially affected by coeducation,
leading to a substantial change in the egalitarian ethos that
is a critical aspect of VMI's training." 976 F. 2d, at 896-897.

In the face of these findings by two courts below, amply
supported by the evidence, and resulting in the conclusion
that VMI would be fundamentally altered if it admitted
women, this Court simply pronounces that "[t]he notion that

admission of women would downgrade VMI's stature, de-stroy the adversative system and, with it, even the school, is

a judgment hardly proved." Ante, at 542 (footnote omitted).The point about "downgrad[ing] VMI's stature" is a straw
man; no one has made any such claim. The point about "de-stroy[ing] the adversative system" is simply false; the District Court not only stated that "[e]vidence supports thistheory," but specifically concluded that while "[w]ithout a
doubt" VMI could assimilate women, "it is equally without adoubt that VMI's present methods of training and education
would have to be changed" by a "move away from its adver-sative new cadet system." 766 F. Supp., at 1413, and n. 8,
1440. And the point about "destroy[ing] the school," de-pending upon what that ambiguous phrase is intended to
mean, is either false or else sets a standard much higher thanVMI had to meet. It sufficed to establish, as the District
Court stated, that VMI would be "significantly different"upon the admission of women, 766 F. Supp., at 1412, and
"would eventually find it necessary to drop the adversativesystem altogether,"

id., at 1413.5

5 The Court's do-it-yourself approach to factfinding, which throughout is
contrary to our well-settled rule that we will not "undertake to review
concurrent findings of fact by two courts below in the absence of a very
obvious and exceptional showing of error," Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v.
Linde Air Products Co., 336 U. S. 271, 275 (1949) (and cases cited), is exemplified by its invocation of the experience of the federal military academies
to prove that not much change would occur. See ante, at 542, n. 11; 544-
545, and n. 15; 550-551, n. 19. In fact, the District Court noted that "the
West Point experience" supported the theory that a coeducational VMI
would have to "adopt a [different] system," for West Point found it necessary upon becoming coeducational to "move away" from its adversative
system. 766 F. Supp., at 1413, 1440. "Without a doubt . . . VMI's present
methods of training and education would have to be changed as West
Point's were." Id., at 1413, n. 8; accord, 976 F. 2d 890, 896-897 (CA4 1992)
(upholding District Court's findings that "the unique characteristics of
VMI's program," including its "unique methodology," "would be destroyed
by coeducation").

6. Finally, the absence of a precise "all-women's analogue"
to VMI is irrelevant. In Mississippi Univ. for Women v.
Hogan, 458 U. S. 718 (1982), we attached no constitutional
significance to the absence of an all-male nursing school. As
Virginia notes, if a program restricted to one sex is necessarily unconstitutional unless there is a parallel program
restricted to the other sex, "the opinion in Hogan could
have ended with its first footnote, which observed that `Mississippi maintains no other single-sex public university or
college.' " Brief for Cross-Petitioners in No. 94-2107, p. 38
(quoting Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, supra, at
720, n. 1).

Although there is no precise female-only analogue to VMI,
Virginia has created during this litigation the Virginia
Women's Institute for Leadership (VWIL), a state-funded
all-women's program run by Mary Baldwin College. I have
thus far said nothing about VWIL because it is, under our
established test, irrelevant, so long as VMI's all-male character is "substantially related" to an important state goal.
But VWIL now exists, and the Court's treatment of it shows
how far reaching today's decision is.

VWIL was carefully designed by professional educators
who have long experience in educating young women. The
program rejects the proposition that there is a "difference in
the respective spheres and destinies of man and woman,"
Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130, 141 (1873), and is designed
to "provide an all-female program that will achieve substantially similar outcomes [to VMI's] in an all-female environment," 852 F. Supp. 471, 481 (WD Va. 1994). After holding a
trial where voluminous evidence was submitted and making
detailed findings of fact, the District Court concluded that
"there is a legitimate pedagogical basis for the different
means employed [by VMI and VWIL] to achieve the sub518us2$84K 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT

591Cite as: 518 U. S. 515 (1996)
Scalia, J., dissenting
stantially similar ends." Ibid. The Court of Appeals undertook a detailed review of the record and affirmed. 44
F. 3d 1229 (CA4 1995).6 But it is Mary Baldwin College,
which runs VWIL, that has made the point most succinctly:

"It would have been possible to develop the VWIL
program to more closely resemble VMI, with adversative techniques associated with the rat line and
barracks-like living quarters. Simply replicating an
existing program would have required far less thought,
research, and educational expertise. But such a facile
approach would have produced a paper program with no
real prospect of successful implementation." Brief for
Mary Baldwin College as Amicus Curiae 5.

It is worth noting that none of the United States' own experts in the remedial phase of this litigation was willing to
testify that VMI's adversative method was an appropriate
methodology for educating women. This Court, however,
does not care. Even though VWIL was carefully designed
by professional educators who have tremendous experience
in the area, and survived the test of adversarial litigation,
the Court simply declares, with no basis in the evidence, that

6 The Court is incorrect in suggesting that the Court of Appeals applied
a "deferential" "brand of review inconsistent with the more exacting
standard our precedent requires." Ante, at 555. That court "inquir[ed]
(1) whether the state's objective is `legitimate and important,' and (2)
whether `the requisite direct, substantial relationship between objective
and means is present,' " 44 F. 3d, at 1235 (quoting Mississippi Univ. for
Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 725 (1982)). To be sure, such review is
"deferential" to a degree that the Court's new standard is not, for it is
intermediate scrutiny. (The Court cannot evade this point or prove the
Court of Appeals too deferential by stating that that court "devised another test, a `substantive comparability' inquiry,' " ante, at 555 (quoting 44
F. 3d, at 1237), for as that court explained, its "substantive comparability"
inquiry was an "additional step" that it engrafted on "th[e] traditional
test" of intermediate scrutiny, ibid. (emphasis added).)

these professionals acted on " `overbroad' generalizations,"
ante, at 542, 550.

C

A few words are appropriate in response to the concurrence, which finds VMI unconstitutional on a basis that is
more moderate than the Court's but only at the expense of
being even more implausible. The concurrence offers three
reasons: First, that there is "scant evidence in the record,"
ante, at 562, that diversity of educational offering was the
real reason for Virginia's maintaining VMI. "Scant" has the
advantage of being an imprecise term. I have cited the
clearest statements of diversity as a goal for higher education in the 1990 Report, the 1989 Virginia Plan for Higher
Education, the Budget Initiatives prepared in 1989 by the
State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, the 1974 Report of the General Assembly Commission on Higher Education to the General Assembly of Virginia, and the 1969 Report of the Virginia Commission on Constitutional Revision.
See supra, at 579, 581-582, and n. 2, 583, n. 3. There is no
evidence to the contrary, once one rejects (as the concurrence
rightly does) the relevance of VMI's founding in days when
attitudes toward the education of women were different.
Is this conceivably not enough to foreclose rejecting as
clearly erroneous the District Court's determination regarding "the Commonwealth's objective of educational diversity"? 766 F. Supp., at 1413. Especially since it is absurd
on its face even to demand "evidence" to prove that the Commonwealth's reason for maintaining a men's military academy is that a men's military academy provides a distinctive
type of educational experience (i. e., fosters diversity).
What other purpose would the Commonwealth have? One
may argue, as the Court does, that this type of diversity is
designed only to indulge hostility toward women--but that
is a separate point, explicitly rejected by the concurrence,
and amply refuted by the evidence I have mentioned in dis518us2$84K 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT

cussing the Court's opinion.7 What is now under discus-sion--the concurrence's making central to the disposition of

this litigation the supposedly "scant" evidence that Virginiamaintained VMI in order to offer a diverse educational experience--is rather like making crucial to the lawfulness of theUnited States Army record "evidence" that its purpose is to
do battle. A legal culture that has forgotten the conceptof

res ipsa loquitur deserves the fate that it today decreesfor VMI.

Second, the concurrence dismisses out of hand what it callsVirginia's "second justification for the single-sex admissions
policy: maintenance of the adversative method." Ante, at564. The concurrence reasons that "this justification does
not serve an important governmental objective" because,whatever the record may show about the pedagogical benefits of single-sex education, "there is no similar evidence inthe record that an adversative method is pedagogically beneficial or is any more likely to produce character traits thanother methodologies."

Ibid. That is simply wrong. See,
e. g., 766 F. Supp., at 1426 (factual findings concerning charac-ter traits produced by VMI's adversative methodology);

id., at 1434 (factual findings concerning benefits for manycollege-age men of an adversative approach in general). In
reality, the pedagogical benefits of VMI's adversative ap-proach were not only proved, but were a given in this litigation. The reason the woman applicant who prompted thissuit wanted to enter VMI was assuredly not that she wanted
to go to an all-male school; it would cease being all-male as

7 The concurrence states that it "read[s] the Court" not "as saying that
the diversity rationale is a pretext" for discriminating against women,
but as saying merely that the diversity rationale is not genuine. Ante,
at 562, n. The Court itself makes no such disclaimer, which would be
difficult to credit inasmuch as the foundation for its conclusion that the
diversity rationale is not "genuin[e]," ante, at 539, is its antecedent discussion of Virginia's "deliberate" actions over the past century and a half,
based on "[f]amiliar arguments," that sought to enforce once "widely held
views about women's proper place," ante, at 537, 538.

594 UNITED STATES v. VIRGINIA

Scalia, J., dissenting
soon as she entered. She wanted the distinctive adversativeeducation that VMI provided, and the battle was joined (in

the main) over whether VMI had a basis for excludingwomen from that approach. The Court's opinion recognizes
this, and devotes much of its opinion to demonstrating that
" `some women . . . do well under [the] adversative model' "and that "[i]t is on behalf of these women that the United

States has instituted this suit." Ante, at 550 (quoting 766F. Supp., at 1434). Of course, in the last analysis it does not
matter whether there are any benefits to the adversativemethod. The concurrence does not contest that there are
benefits to single-sex education, and that alone suffices to
make Virginia's case, since admission of a woman will even
more surely put an end to VMI's single-sex education than
it will to VMI's adversative methodology.

A third reason the concurrence offers in support of the
judgment is that the Commonwealth and VMI were not
quick enough to react to the "further developments" in this
Court's evolving jurisprudence. Ante, at 561. Specifically,
the concurrence believes it should have been clear after
Hogan that "[t]he difficulty with [Virginia's] position is that
the diversity benefited only one sex; there was single-sex
public education available for men at VMI, but no corresponding single-sex public education available for women."
Ante, at 562. If only, the concurrence asserts, Virginia had
"made a genuine effort to devote comparable public resources to a facility for women, and followed through on such
a plan, it might well have avoided an equal protection violation." Ante, at 563. That is to say, the concurrence believes that after our decision in Hogan (which held a program
of the Mississippi University for Women to be unconstitutional--without any reliance on the fact that there was no
corresponding Mississippi all-men's program), the Commonwealth should have known that what this Court expected of
it was . . . yes!, the creation of a state all-women's program.
Any lawyer who gave that advice to the Commonwealth

ought to have been either disbarred or committed. (Theproof of that pudding is today's 6-Justice majority opinion.)

And any Virginia politician who proposed such a step whenthere were already four 4-year women's colleges in Virginia
(assisted by state support that may well exceed, in the ag-gregate, what VMI costs, see n. 3,

supra) ought to havebeen recalled.

In any event, "diversity in the form of single-sex, as wellas coeducational, institutions of higher learning" is "available to women as well as to men" in Virginia. Ante, at 564.The concurrence is able to assert the contrary only by disregarding the four all-women's private colleges in Virginia(generously assisted by public funds) and the Commonwealth's longstanding policy of coordinating public with pri-vate educational offerings, see

supra, at 579, 581-582, andn. 2, 583-584, and n. 3. According to the concurrence, the

reason Virginia's assistance to its four all-women's privatecolleges does not count is that "[t]he private women's colleges
are treated by the State exactly as all other private schoolsare treated."

Ante, at 564. But if Virginia cannot getcredit for assisting women's education if it only treats

women's private schools as it does all other private schools,then why should it get blame for assisting men's education
if it only treats VMI as it does all other public schools? Thisis a great puzzlement.

IV
As is frequently true, the Court's decision today will haveconsequences that extend far beyond the parties to the litigation. What I take to be the Court's unease with these con-sequences, and its resulting unwillingness to acknowledge
them, cannot alter the reality.

A
Under the constitutional principles announced and appliedtoday, single-sex public education is unconstitutional. By

going through the motions of applying a balancing test--ask518us2$84K 05-20-99 06:38:20 PAGES OPINPGT
596 UNITED STATES v. VIRGINIA

Scalia, J., dissenting
ing whether the State has adduced an "exceedingly persua-sive justification" for its sex-based classification--the Court

creates the illusion that government officials in some futurecase will have a clear shot at justifying some sort of singlesex public education. Indeed, the Court seeks to createeven a greater illusion than that: It purports to have said
nothing of relevance to other public schools at all. "Weaddress specifically and only an educational opportunity recognized . . . as `unique.' " Ante, at 534, n. 7.The Supreme Court of the United States does not sit to
announce "unique" dispositions. Its principal function is to
establish precedent--that is, to set forth principles of law
that every court in America must follow. As we said onlythis Term, we expect both ourselves and lower courts to

adhere to the "rationale upon which the Court based theresults of its earlier decisions."

Seminole Tribe of Fla. v.
Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 66-67 (1996) (emphasis added). Thatis the principal reason we publish our opinions.

And the rationale of today's decision is sweeping: for sex-based classifications, a redefinition of intermediate scrutiny
that makes it indistinguishable from strict scrutiny. See
supra, at 571-574. Indeed, the Court indicates that if anyprogram restricted to one sex is "uniqu[e]," it must be opened

to members of the opposite sex "who have the will and capac-ity" to participate in it.

Ante, at 542. I suggest that the
single-sex program that will not be capable of being charac-terized as "unique" is not only unique but nonexistent.

8

In any event, regardless of whether the Court's rationale
leaves some small amount of room for lawyers to argue, it
ensures that single-sex public education is functionally dead.

8 In this regard, I note that the Court--which I concede is under no
obligation to do so--provides no example of a program that would pass
muster under its reasoning today: not even, for example, a football or
wrestling program. On the Court's theory, any woman ready, willing, and
physically able to participate in such a program would, as a constitutional
matter, be entitled to do so.

Scalia, J., dissenting
The costs of litigating the constitutionality of a single-sexeducation program, and the risks of ultimately losing that

litigation, are simply too high to be embraced by public offi-cials. Any person with standing to challenge any sex-based
classification can haul the State into federal court and compel
it to establish by evidence (presumably in the form of experttestimony) that there is an "exceedingly persuasive justification" for the classification. Should the courts happen tointerpret that vacuous phrase as establishing a standard that
is not utterly impossible of achievement, there is consider-able risk that whether the standard has been met will not be
determined on the basis of the record evidence--indeed, that
will necessarily be the approach of any court that seeks to
walk the path the Court has trod today. No state official in
his right mind will buy such a high-cost, high-risk lawsuit by
commencing a single-sex program. The enemies of singlesex education have won; by persuading only seven Justices
(five would have been enough) that their view of the world
is enshrined in the Constitution, they have effectively imposed that view on all 50 States.

This is especially regrettable because, as the District
Court here determined, educational experts in recent years
have increasingly come to "suppor[t] [the] view that substantial educational benefits flow from a single-gender environment, be it male or female, that cannot be replicated in
a coeducational setting." 766 F. Supp., at 1415 (emphasis
added). "The evidence in th[is] case," for example, "is virtually uncontradicted" to that effect. Ibid. Until quite recently, some public officials have attempted to institute new
single-sex programs, at least as experiments. In 1991, for
example, the Detroit Board of Education announced a program to establish three boys-only schools for inner-city
youth; it was met with a lawsuit, a preliminary injunction
was swiftly entered by a District Court that purported to
rely on Hogan, see Garrett v. Board of Ed. of School Dist.
of Detroit, 775 F. Supp. 1004, 1006 (ED Mich. 1991), and the

Detroit Board of Education voted to abandon the litigationand thus abandon the plan, see Detroit Plan to Aid Blacks

with All-Boy Schools Abandoned, Los Angeles Times, Nov.8, 1991, p. A4, col. 1. Today's opinion assures that no such
experiment will be tried again.

B
There are few extant single-sex public educational pro-grams. The potential of today's decision for widespread

disruption of existing institutions lies in its applicationto private single-sex education. Government support is
immensely important to private educational institutions.Mary Baldwin College--which designed and runs VWIL--
notes that private institutions of higher education in the1990-1991 school year derived approximately 19 percent of
their budgets from federal, state, and local governmentfunds,

not including financial aid to students. See Brieffor Mary Baldwin College as Amicus Curiae 22, n. 13 (citing

U. S. Dept. of Education, National Center for Education Sta-tistics, Digest of Education Statistics, p. 38 and Note (1993)).
Charitable status under the tax laws is also highly significantfor private educational institutions, and it is certainly not
beyond the Court that rendered today's decision to hold thata donation to a single-sex college should be deemed contrary
to public policy and therefore not deductible if the collegediscriminates on the basis of sex. See Note, The Independent Sector and the Tax Laws: Defining Charity in an IdealDemocracy, 64 S. Cal. L. Rev. 461, 476 (1991). See also

BobJones Univ. v. United States, 461 U. S. 574 (1983).

The Court adverts to private single-sex education onlybriefly, and only to make the assertion (mentioned above)
that "[w]e address specifically and only an educational oppor-tunity recognized by the District Court and the Court of
Appeals as `unique.' " Ante, at 534, n. 7. As I have alreadyremarked, see

supra, at 596, that assurance assures noth-ing, unless it is to be taken as a promise that in the future

Scalia, J., dissenting
the Court will disclaim the reasoning it has used today todestroy VMI. The Government, in its briefs to this Court,

at least purports to address the consequences of its attackon VMI for public support of private single-sex education.
It contends that private colleges that are the direct or indirect beneficiaries of government funding are not therebynecessarily converted into state actors to which the Equal

Protection Clause is then applicable. See Brief for UnitedStates in No. 94-2107, at 35-37 (discussing

Rendell-Baker v.
Kohn, 457 U. S. 830 (1982), and Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U. S.991 (1982)). That is true. It is also virtually meaningless.

The issue will be not whether government assistance turns
private colleges into state actors, but whether the government itself would be violating the Constitution by providing
state support to single-sex colleges. For example, in Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U. S. 455 (1973), we saw no room to
distinguish between state operation of racially segregated
schools and state support of privately run segregated
schools. "Racial discrimination in state-operated schools is
barred by the Constitution and `[i]t is also axiomatic that a
state may not induce, encourage or promote private persons
to accomplish what it is constitutionally forbidden to accomplish.' " Id., at 465 (quoting Lee v. Macon County Bd. of
Ed., 267 F. Supp. 458, 475-476 (MD Ala. 1967)); see also
Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1, 19 (1958) ("State support of
segregated schools through any arrangement, management,
funds, or property cannot be squared with the [Fourteenth]
Amendment's command that no State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws");
Grove City College v. Bell, 465 U. S. 555, 565 (1984) (case
arising under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972
and stating that "[t]he economic effect of direct and indirect
assistance often is indistinguishable"). When the Government was pressed at oral argument concerning the implications of these cases for private single-sex education if

Scalia, J., dissenting
tional, it stated that the implications will not be so disas-trous, since States can provide funding to racially segregated private schools, "depend[ing] on the circumstances,"Tr. of Oral Arg. 56. I cannot imagine what those "circumstances" might be, and it would be as foolish for private-school administrators to think that that assurance from the
Justice Department will outlive the day it was made, as itwas for VMI to think that the Justice Department's "unequivoca[l]" support for an intermediate-scrutiny standardin this litigation would survive the Government's loss in the
courts below.The only hope for state-assisted single-sex private schools
is that the Court will not apply in the future the principlesof law it has applied today. That is a substantial hope, I am
happy and ashamed to say. After all, did not the Courttoday abandon the principles of law it has applied in our earlier sex-classification cases? And does not the Court posi-tively invite private colleges to rely upon our ad-hocery by
assuring them this litigation is "unique"? I would not ad-vise the foundation of any new single-sex college (especially
an all-male one) with the expectation of being allowed toreceive any government support; but it is too soon to abandon in despair those single-sex colleges already in existence.It will certainly be possible for this Court to write a future
opinion that ignores the broad principles of law set forthtoday, and that characterizes as utterly dispositive the opinion's perceptions that VMI was a uniquely prestigious all-male institution, conceived in chauvinism, etc., etc. I will
not join that opinion.

and economic experiments without risk to the rest of thecountry."

(1932) (dissenting opinion). But it is one of the unhappy incidents of the federal system that a self-righteous Supreme
Court, acting on its Members' personal view of what would
make a " `more perfect Union,' " ante, at 558 (a criterion only
slightly more restrictive than a "more perfect world"), can
impose its own favored social and economic dispositions
nationwide. As today's disposition, and others this single
Term, show, this places it beyond the power of a "single courageous State," not only to introduce novel dispositions that
the Court frowns upon, but to reintroduce, or indeed even
adhere to, disfavored dispositions that are centuries old.
See, e. g., BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, 517 U. S. 559
(1996); Romer v. Evans, 517 U. S. 620 (1996). The sphere of
self-government reserved to the people of the Republic is
progressively narrowed.

In the course of this dissent, I have referred approvingly
to the opinion of my former colleague, Justice Powell, in Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718 (1982).
Many of the points made in his dissent apply with equal force
here--in particular, the criticism of judicial opinions that
purport to be "narro[w]" but whose "logic" is "sweepin[g]."
Id., at 745-746, n. 18. But there is one statement with
which I cannot agree. Justice Powell observed that the
Court's decision in Hogan, which struck down a single-sex
program offered by the Mississippi University for Women,
had thereby "[l]eft without honor . . . an element of diversity
that has characterized much of American education and enriched much of American life." Id., at 735. Today's decision does not leave VMI without honor; no court opinion can
do that.

In an odd sort of way, it is precisely VMI's attachment to
such old-fashioned concepts as manly "honor" that has made
it, and the system it represents, the target of those who
today succeed in abolishing public single-sex education.

dents (the so-called "rats") were required to keep in their
possession at all times. Near the end there appears the

"Without a strict observance of the fundamental Code
of Honor, no man, no matter how `polished,' can be considered a gentleman. The honor of a gentleman demands the inviolability of his word, and the incorruptibility of his principles. He is the descendant of the

COLORADO REPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN

COMMITTEE et al. v. FEDERAL ELECTION

COMMISSION

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 95-489. Argued April 15, 1996--Decided June 26, 1996
Before the Colorado Republican Party selected its 1986 senatorial candidate, its Federal Campaign Committee (Colorado Party), a petitioner
here, bought radio advertisements attacking the Democratic Party's
likely candidate. The Federal Election Commission (FEC) brought suit
charging that the Colorado Party had violated the "Party Expenditure
Provision" of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), 2
U. S. C. $ 441a(d)(3), which imposes dollar limits upon political party "expenditure[s] in connection with the general election campaign of a [congressional] candidate." The Colorado Party defended in part by claiming that the expenditure limitations violated the First Amendment as
applied to its advertisements, and filed a counterclaim seeking to raise
a facial challenge to the provision as a whole. The District Court interpreted the "in connection with" language narrowly and held that the
provision did not cover the expenditure at issue. It therefore entered
summary judgment for the Colorado Party, dismissing the counterclaim
as moot. In ordering judgment for the FEC, the Court of Appeals
adopted a somewhat broader interpretation of the provision, which, it
said, both covered this expenditure and satisfied the Constitution.

Held: The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded.
59 F. 3d 1015, vacated and remanded.

Justice Breyer, joined by Justice O'Connor and Justice Souter,
concluded that the First Amendment prohibits application of the Party
Expenditure Provision to the kind of expenditure at issue here--an
expenditure that the political party has made independently, without
coordination with any candidate. Pp. 613-623.

(a) The outcome is controlled by this Court's FECA case law. After
weighing the First Amendment interest in permitting candidates (and
their supporters) to spend money to advance their political views,
against a "compelling" governmental interest in protecting the electoral
system from the appearance and reality of corruption, see, e. g., Buckley
v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 14-23 (per curiam), the Court has ruled unconstitutional FECA provisions that, inter alia, limited the right of individuals,

id., at 39-51, and political committees, Federal Election Comm'n v.
National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 497, to
make "independent" expenditures not coordinated with a candidate or
a candidate's campaign, but has permitted other FECA provisions that
imposed contribution limits both when an individual or political committee contributed money directly to a candidate, and when they contributed indirectly by making expenditures that they coordinated with the
candidate, see Buckley, supra, at 23-36, 46-48. The summary judgment record indicates that the expenditure here at issue must be
treated, for constitutional purposes, as an "independent" expenditure
entitled to First Amendment protection, not as an indirect campaign
contribution subject to regulation. There is uncontroverted direct evidence that the Colorado Party developed its advertising campaign independently and not pursuant to any understanding with a candidate.
Since the Government does not point to evidence or legislative findings
suggesting any special corruption problem in respect to political parties'
independent expenditures, the Court's prior cases forbid regulation of
such expenditures. Pp. 613-619.

(b) The Government's argument that this expenditure is not "independent," but is rather a "coordinated expenditure," which this Court
has treated as a "contribution" that Congress may constitutionally regulate, is rejected. The summary judgment record shows no actual coordination with candidates as a matter of fact. The Government's claim
for deference to FEC interpretations rendering all party expenditures
"coordinated" is unpersuasive. Federal Election Comm'n v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm., 454 U. S. 27, 28-29, n. 1, distinguished. These regulations and advisory opinions do not represent

an empirical judgment by the FEC that all party expenditures are coordinated with candidates or that party independent and coordinated
expenditures cannot be distinguished in practice. Also unconvincing
are the Government's contentions that the Colorado Party has conceded
that the expenditure here is "coordinated," and that such coordination
exists because a party and its candidate are, in some sense, identical.
Pp. 619-623.

(c) Because this expenditure is "independent," the Court need not
reach the broader question argued by the Colorado Party: whether, in
the special case of political parties, the First Amendment also forbids
congressional efforts to limit coordinated expenditures. While the
Court is not deprived of jurisdiction to consider this facial challenge by
the failure of the parties and the lower courts to focus specifically on the
complex issues involved in determining the constitutionality of political
parties' coordinated expenditures, that lack of focus provides a prudential reason for the Court not to decide the broader question. This is

the first case to raise the question, and the Court should defer action
until the lower courts have considered it in light of this decision.
Pp. 623-626.

Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice
Scalia, concluded that, on its face, FECA violates the First Amendment when it restricts as a "contribution" a political party's spending "in
cooperation, consultation, or concert, with . . . a candidate." 2 U. S. C.

$ 441a(a)(7)(B)(i). The Court in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (per curiam), had no occasion to consider limitations on political parties'
expenditures, id., at 58, n. 66, and its reasoning upholding ordinary contribution limitations should not be extended to a case that does. Buckley's central holding is that spending money on one's own speech must
be permitted, id., at 44-58, and that is what political parties do when
they make the expenditures that $ 441a(a)(7)(B)(i) restricts as "contribution[s]." Party spending "in cooperation, consultation, or concer[t]
with" a candidate is indistinguishable in substance from expenditures
by the candidate or his campaign committee. The First Amendment
does not permit regulation of the latter, see id., at 54-59, and it should
not permit this regulation of the former. Pp. 626-631.

Justice Thomas, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia,
concluded in Parts I and III that 2 U. S. C. $ 441a(d)(3) is unconstitutional not only as applied to petitioners, but also on its face.
Pp. 631-634, 644-648.

(a) The Court should decide the Colorado Party's facial challenge to

$ 441a(d)(3), addressing the constitutionality of limits on coordinated
expenditures by political parties. That question is squarely before the
Court, and the principal opinion's reasons for not reaching it are unpersuasive. In addition, concerns for the chilling of First Amendment
expression counsel in favor of resolving the question. Reaching the
facial challenge will make clear the circumstances under which political parties may engage in political speech without running afoul of

$ 441a(d)(3). Pp. 631-634.

(b) Section 441a(d)(3) cannot withstand a facial challenge under the
framework established by Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (per curiam).
The anticorruption rationale that the Court has relied on is inapplicable
in the specific context of campaign funding by political parties, since
there is only a minimal threat of corruption when a party spends to
support its candidate or to oppose his competitor, whether or not that
expenditure is made in concert with the candidate. Parties and candidates have traditionally worked together to achieve their common goals,
and when they engage in that work, there is no risk to the Republic.
To the contrary, the danger lies in Government suppression of such
activity. Pp. 644-648.

Justice Thomas also concluded in Part II that, in resolving the facial
challenge, the Buckley framework should be rejected because there is
no constitutionally significant difference between campaign contributions and expenditures: Both involve core expression and basic associational rights that are central to the First Amendment. Curbs on
such speech must be strictly scrutinized. See, e. g., Federal Election
Comm'n v. National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S.
480, 501. Section 441a(d)(3)'s limits on independent and coordinated expenditures fail strict scrutiny because the statute is not narrowly tailored to serve the compelling governmental interest in preventing the
fact or appearance of "corruption," which this Court has narrowly defined as a "financial quid pro quo: dollars for political favors," id., at 497.
Contrary to the Court's ruling in Buckley, supra, at 28, bribery laws
and disclosure requirements present less restrictive means of preventing corruption than does $ 441a(d)(3), which indiscriminately covers
many conceivable instances in which a party committee could exceed
spending limits without any intent to extract an unlawful commitment
from a candidate. Pp. 640-644.

COMM. v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N

Opinion of Breyer, J.

Justice Breyer announced the judgment of the Court
and delivered an opinion, in which Justice O'Connor and
Justice Souter join.

In April 1986, before the Colorado Republican Party had
selected its senatorial candidate for the fall's election, that
party's Federal Campaign Committee bought radio advertisements attacking Timothy Wirth, the Democratic Party's
likely candidate. The Federal Election Commission (FEC)
charged that this "expenditure" exceeded the dollar limits
that a provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act of
1971 (FECA or Act) imposes upon political party "expenditure[s] in connection with" a "general election campaign" for
congressional office. 90 Stat. 486, as amended, 2 U. S. C.

$ 441a(d)(3). This case focuses upon the constitutionality of
those limits as applied to this case. We conclude that the
First Amendment prohibits the application of this provision
to the kind of expenditure at issue here--an expenditure that
the political party has made independently, without coordination with any candidate.

Opinion of Breyer, J.

I
To understand the issues and our holding, one must begin
with FECA as it emerged from Congress in 1974. That Act
sought both to remedy the appearance of a "corrupt" political
process (one in which large contributions seem to buy legislative votes) and to level the electoral playing field by reducing
campaign costs. See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 25-27
(1976) (per curiam). It consequently imposed limits upon
the amounts that individuals, corporations, "political committees" (such as political action committees, or PAC's), and
political parties could contribute to candidates for federal
office, and it also imposed limits upon the amounts that candidates, corporations, labor unions, political committees, and
political parties could spend, even on their own, to help a
candidate win election. See 18 U. S. C. $$ 608, 610 (1970 ed.,
Supp. IV).

This Court subsequently examined several of the Act's
provisions in light of the First Amendment's free speech and
association protections. See Federal Election Comm'n v.
Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238 (1986);
Federal Election Comm'n v. National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S. 480 (1985) (NCPAC); California
Medical Assn. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 453 U. S. 182
(1981); Buckley, supra. In these cases, the Court essentially weighed the First Amendment interest in permitting
candidates (and their supporters) to spend money to advance
their political views against a "compelling" governmental interest in assuring the electoral system's legitimacy, protecting it from the appearance and reality of corruption. See
Massachusetts Citizens for Life, supra, at 256-263; NCPAC,
supra, at 493-501; California Medical Assn., supra, at 193-
199; Buckley, 424 U. S., at 14-23. After doing so, the Court
found that the First Amendment prohibited some of FECA's
provisions, but permitted others.

610 COLORADO REPUBLICAN FEDERAL CAMPAIGN

COMM. v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N

Opinion of Breyer, J.

Most of the provisions this Court found unconstitutionalimposed

expenditure limits. Those provisions limited candidates' rights to spend their own money, id., at 51-54, limiteda candidate's campaign expenditures,

id., at 54-58, limited
the right of individuals to make "independent" expenditures
(not coordinated with the candidate or candidate's campaign),
id., at 39-51, and similarly limited the right of political
committees to make "independent" expenditures, NCPAC,
supra, at 497. The provisions that the Court found constitutional mostly imposed contribution limits--limits that applyboth when an individual or political committee contributes

money directly to a candidate and also when they indirectlycontribute by making expenditures that they coordinate with
the candidate, $ 441a(a)(7)(B)(i). See Buckley, supra, at 23-
36. See also 424 U. S., at 46-48; California Medical Assn.,
supra, at 193-199 (limits on contributions to political committees). Consequently, for present purposes, the Act nowprohibits individuals and political committees from making

direct, or indirect, contributions that exceed the followinglimits:

(a) For any "person": $1,000 to a candidate "with re-spect to any election"; $5,000 to any political committee
in any year; $20,000 to the national committees of a polit-ical party in any year; but all within an overall limit
(for any individual in any year) of $25,000. 2 U. S. C.$$ 441a(a)(1), (3).

(b) For any "multicandidate political committee":
$5,000 to a candidate "with respect to any election";$5,000 to any political committee in any year; and

$15,000 to the national committees of a political party

in any year. $ 441a(a)(2).

FECA also has a special provision, directly at issue in this
case, that governs contributions and expenditures by political parties. $ 441a(d). This special provision creates, in
part, an exception to the above contribution limits. That

518us2$85Q 05-18-99 20:59:55 PAGES OPINPGT

611Cite as: 518 U. S. 604 (1996)
Opinion of Breyer, J.
is, without special treatment, political parties ordinarilywould be subject to the general limitation on contributions

by a "multicandidate political committee" just described.See $ 441a(a)(4). That provision, as we said in subsection
(b) above, limits annual contributions by a "multicandidate political committee" to no more than $5,000 to any can-didate. And as also mentioned above, this contribution limit

governs not only direct contributions but also indirect contri-butions that take the form of coordinated expenditures, defined as "expenditures made . . . in cooperation, consultation,or concert, with, or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, his authorized political committees, or their agents."$ 441a(a)(7)(B)(i). Thus, ordinarily, a party's coordinated expenditures would be subject to the $5,000 limitation.

However, FECA's special provision, which we shall call the"Party Expenditure Provision," creates a

general exception
from this contribution limitation, and from any other limita-tion on expenditures. It says:

"Notwithstanding any other provision of law withrespect to

limitations on expenditures or limitations
on contributions, . . . political party [committees] . . .may make

expenditures in connection with the general
election campaign of candidates for Federal office . . . ."$ 441a(d)(1) (emphasis added).

After exempting political parties from the general contribu-tion and expenditure limitations of the statute, the Party
Expenditure Provision then imposes a substitute limitationupon party "expenditures" in a senatorial campaign equal to
the greater of $20,000 or "2 cents multiplied by the voting
age population of the State," $ 441a(d)(3)(A)(i), adjusted for
inflation since 1974, $ 441a(c). The provision permitted a political party in Colorado in 1986 to spend about $103,000 in
connection with the general election campaign of a candidate
for the United States Senate. See FEC Record, vol. 12,
no. 4, p. 1 (Apr. 1986). (A different provision, not at issue

in this case, $ 441a(d)(2), limits party expenditures in connec-tion with Presidential campaigns. Since this case involves

only the provision concerning congressional races, we do notaddress issues that might grow out of the public funding of
Presidential campaigns.)

In January 1986, Timothy Wirth, then a Democratic Con-gressman, announced that he would run for an open Senate

seat in November. In April, before either the Democraticprimary or the Republican convention, the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee (Colorado Party or Party),a petitioner here, bought radio advertisements attacking
Congressman Wirth. The State Democratic Party complained to the FEC. It pointed out that the Colorado Party
had previously assigned its $103,000 general election allotment to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, leaving it without any permissible spending balance. See Federal Election Comm'n v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Comm., 454 U. S. 27 (1981) (state party may appoint national
senatorial campaign committee as agent to spend its Party
Expenditure Provision allotment). It argued that the purchase of radio time was an "expenditure in connection with
the general election campaign of a candidate for Federal office," $ 441a(d)(3), which, consequently, exceeded the Party
Expenditure Provision limits.

The FEC agreed with the Democratic Party. It brought
a complaint against the Colorado Party, charging a violation.
The Colorado Party defended in part by claiming that the
Party Expenditure Provision's expenditure limitations violated the First Amendment--a charge that it repeated in a
counterclaim that said the Colorado Party intended to make
other "expenditures directly in connection with" senatorial elections, App. 68, || 48, and attacked the constitutionality of the entire Party Expenditure Provision. The Federal District Court interpreted the provision's words " `in
connection with' the general election campaign of a candidate" narrowly, as meaning only expenditures for advertis518us2$85Q 05-18-99 20:59:55 PAGES OPINPGT

ing using " `express words of advocacy of election or defeat.' "839 F. Supp. 1448, 1455 (Colo. 1993) (quoting Buckley, 424

U. S., at 46, n. 52). See also Massachusetts Citizens forLife, 479 U. S., at 249. As so interpreted, the court held, the
provision did not cover the expenditures here. The courtentered summary judgment for the Colorado Party and dismissed its counterclaim as moot.Both sides appealed. The Government, for the FEC, argued for a somewhat broader interpretation of the statute--applying the limits to advertisements containing an "electioneering message" about a "clearly identified candidate,"FEC Advisory Op. 1985-14, 2 CCH Fed. Election Camp. Fin.
Guide || 5819, p. 11,185 (May 30, 1985)--which, it said, bothcovered the expenditure and satisfied the Constitution. The
Court of Appeals agreed. It found the Party ExpenditureProvision applicable, held it constitutional, and ordered judgment in the FEC's favor. 59 F. 3d 1015, 1023-1024 (CA101995).

We granted certiorari primarily to consider the ColoradoParty's argument that the Party Expenditure Provision violates the First Amendment "either facially or as applied."Pet. for Cert. i. For reasons we shall discuss in Part IV,
infra, we consider only the latter question--whether theParty Expenditure Provision as applied here violates the
First Amendment. We conclude that it does.

II
The summary judgment record indicates that the expendi-ture in question is what this Court in Buckley called an

"independent" expenditure, not a "coordinated" expenditurethat other provisions of FECA treat as a kind of campaign
"contribution." See Buckley, supra, at 36-37, 46-47, 78;
NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 498. The record describes how theexpenditure was made. In a deposition, the Colorado Party's Chairman, Howard Callaway, pointed out that, at thetime of the expenditure, the Party had not yet selected a

senatorial nominee from among the three individuals vyingfor the nomination. App. 195-196. He added that he arranged for the development of the script at his own initiative,
id., at 200, that he, and no one else, approved it, id., at 199,
that the only other politically relevant individuals who might
have read it were the Party's executive director and politicaldirector,

ibid., and that all relevant discussions took place at
meetings attended only by Party staff, id., at 204.Notwithstanding the above testimony, the Government argued in District Court--and reiterates in passing in its briefto this Court, Brief for Respondent 27, n. 20--that the
deposition showed that the Party had coordinated the advertisement with its candidates. It pointed to Callaway's statement that it was the practice of the Party to "coordinat[e]
with the candidate" "campaign strategy," App. 195, and for
Callaway to be "as involved as [he] could be" with the individuals seeking the Republican nomination, ibid., by making
available to them "all of the assets of the party," id., at 195-
196. These latter statements, however, are general descriptions of Party practice. They do not refer to the advertising
campaign at issue here or to its preparation. Nor do they
conflict with, or cast significant doubt upon, the uncontroverted direct evidence that this advertising campaign was
developed by the Colorado Party independently and not pursuant to any general or particular understanding with a
candidate. We can find no "genuine" issue of fact in this
respect. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(e); Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U. S. 574, 586-587
(1986). And we therefore treat the expenditure, for constitutional purposes, as an "independent" expenditure, not an
indirect campaign contribution.

So treated, the expenditure falls within the scope of the
Court's precedents that extend First Amendment protection
to independent expenditures. Beginning with Buckley, the
Court's cases have found a "fundamental constitutional
difference between money spent to advertise one's views

independently of the candidate's campaign and money con-tributed to the candidate to be spent on his campaign."

NCPAC, supra, at 497. This difference has been groundedin the observation that restrictions on contributions impose
"only a marginal restriction upon the contributor's ability
to engage in free communication," Buckley, supra, at 20-21,because the symbolic communicative value of a contribution

bears little relation to its size, 424 U. S., at 21, and becausesuch limits leave "persons free to engage in independent political expression, to associate actively through volunteeringtheir services, and to assist to a limited but nonetheless substantial extent in supporting candidates and committees with
financial resources," id., at 28. At the same time, reasonable
contribution limits directly and materially advance the Government's interest in preventing exchanges of large financial
contributions for political favors. Id., at 26-27.

In contrast, the Court has said that restrictions on independent expenditures significantly impair the ability of individuals and groups to engage in direct political advocacy and
"represent substantial . . . restraints on the quantity and diversity of political speech." Id., at 19. And at the same
time, the Court has concluded that limitations on independent expenditures are less directly related to preventing corruption, since "[t]he absence of prearrangement and coordination of an expenditure with the candidate . . . not only
undermines the value of the expenditure to the candidate,
but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given
as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate." Id., at 47.

Given these established principles, we do not see how a
provision that limits a political party's independent expenditures can escape their controlling effect. A political party's
independent expression not only reflects its members' views
about the philosophical and governmental matters that bind
them together, it also seeks to convince others to join those
members in a practical democratic task, the task of creating

a government that voters can instruct and hold responsiblefor subsequent success or failure. The independent expression of a political party's views is "core" First Amendmentactivity no less than is the independent expression of individuals, candidates, or other political committees. See, e. g., Eu
v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489U. S. 214 (1989).

We are not aware of any special dangers of corruptionassociated with political parties that tip the constitutional
balance in a different direction. When this Court consid-ered, and held unconstitutional, limits that FECA had set
on certain independent expenditures by PAC's, it reiterated
Buckley's observation that "the absence of prearrangement
and coordination" does not eliminate, but it does help to
"alleviate," any "danger" that a candidate will understand
the expenditure as an effort to obtain a "quid pro quo." See
NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 498. The same is true of independent
party expenditures.

We recognize that FECA permits individuals to contribute
more money ($20,000) to a party than to a candidate ($1,000)
or to other political committees ($5,000). 2 U. S. C. $ 441a(a).
We also recognize that FECA permits unregulated "soft
money" contributions to a party for certain activities, such
as electing candidates for state office, see $ 431(8)(A)(i), or
for voter registration and "get out the vote" drives, see

$ 431(8)(B)(xii). But the opportunity for corruption posed
by these greater opportunities for contributions is, at best,
attenuated. Unregulated "soft money" contributions may
not be used to influence a federal campaign, except when
used in the limited, party-building activities specifically designated in the statute. See $ 431(8)(B). Any contribution
to a party that is earmarked for a particular campaign is
considered a contribution to the candidate and is subject
to the contribution limitations. $ 441a(a)(8). A party may
not simply channel unlimited amounts of even undesignated
contributions to a candidate, since such direct transfers are

also considered contributions and are subject to the contribution limits on a "multicandidate political committee."

$ 441a(a)(2). The greatest danger of corruption, therefore,
appears to be from the ability of donors to give sums up to
$20,000 to a party which may be used for independent party
expenditures for the benefit of a particular candidate. We
could understand how Congress, were it to conclude that the
potential for evasion of the individual contribution limits was
a serious matter, might decide to change the statute's limitations on contributions to political parties. Cf. California
Medical Assn., 453 U. S., at 197-199 (plurality opinion) (danger of evasion of limits on contribution to candidates justified
prophylactic limitation on contributions to PAC's). But we
do not believe that the risk of corruption present here could
justify the "markedly greater burden on basic freedoms
caused by" the statute's limitations on expenditures. Buckley, 424 U. S., at 44. See also id., at 46-47, 51; NCPAC,
supra, at 498. Contributors seeking to avoid the effect of
the $1,000 contribution limit indirectly by donations to the
national party could spend that same amount of money (or
more) themselves more directly by making their own independent expenditures promoting the candidate. See Buckley, supra, at 44-48 (risk of corruption by individuals' independent expenditures is insufficient to justify limits on such
spending). If anything, an independent expenditure made
possible by a $20,000 donation, but controlled and directed
by a party rather than the donor, would seem less likely to
corrupt than the same (or a much larger) independent
expenditure made directly by that donor. In any case, the
constitutionally significant fact, present equally in both instances, is the lack of coordination between the candidate
and the source of the expenditure. See Buckley, supra, at
45-46; NCPAC, supra, at 498. This fact prevents us from
assuming, absent convincing evidence to the contrary, that a
limitation on political parties' independent expenditures is

necessary to combat a substantial danger of corruption of theelectoral system.

The Government does not point to record evidence or leg-islative findings suggesting any special corruption problem
in respect to independent party expenditures. See Turner
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 664 (1994)("When the Government defends a regulation on speech as a

means to . . . prevent anticipated harms, it must do morethan simply posit the existence of the disease sought to
be cured" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted));
NCPAC, supra, at 498. To the contrary, this Court's opinions suggest that Congress wrote the Party Expenditure
Provision not so much because of a special concern about
the potentially "corrupting" effect of party expenditures, but
rather for the constitutionally insufficient purpose of reducing what it saw as wasteful and excessive campaign spending. See Buckley, supra, at 57. In fact, rather than indicating a special fear of the corruptive influence of political
parties, the legislative history demonstrates Congress' general desire to enhance what was seen as an important and
legitimate role for political parties in American elections.
See Federal Election Comm'n v. Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Comm., 454 U. S., at 41 (Party Expenditure Provision was intended to "assur[e] that political parties will
continue to have an important role in federal elections");
S. Rep. No. 93-689, p. 7 (1974) ("[A] vigorous party system
is vital to American politics . . . . [P]ooling resources from
many small contributors is a legitimate function and an integral part of party politics"); id., at 7-8, 15.

We therefore believe that this Court's prior case law controls the outcome here. We do not see how a Constitution
that grants to individuals, candidates, and ordinary political
committees the right to make unlimited independent expenditures could deny the same right to political parties. Having
concluded this, we need not consider the Party's further
claim that the statute's "in connection with" language, and

the FEC's interpretation of that language, are unconstitu-tionally vague. Cf. Buckley, supra, at 40-44.

III
The Government does not deny the force of the precedentwe have discussed. Rather, it argued below, and the lower

courts accepted, that the expenditure in this case should betreated under those precedents, not as an "independent expenditure," but rather as a "coordinated expenditure," whichthose cases have treated as "contributions," and which those
cases have held Congress may constitutionally regulate.See,

e. g., Buckley, supra, at 23-38.While the District Court found that the expenditure in

this case was "coordinated," 839 F. Supp., at 1453, it did notdo so based on any factual finding that the Party had consulted with any candidate in the making or planning of theadvertising campaign in question. Instead, the District
Court accepted the Government's argument that all partyexpenditures should be treated as if they had been coordinated as a matter of law, "[b]ased on Supreme Court prece-dent and the Commission's interpretation of the statute,"
ibid. The Court of Appeals agreed with this legal conclu-sion. 59 F. 3d, at 1024. Thus, the lower courts' "finding"
of coordination does not conflict with our conclusion, supra,at 613-614, that the summary judgment record shows no actual coordination as a matter of fact. The question, instead,is whether the Court of Appeals erred as a legal matter in
accepting the Government's conclusive presumption that allparty expenditures are "coordinated." We believe it did.

In support of its argument, the Government points to aset of legal materials, based on FEC interpretations, that
seem to say or imply that all party expenditures are "coordi-nated." These include: (1) an FEC regulation that forbids
political parties to make any "independent expenditures . . .in connection with" a "general election campaign," 11 CFR

$ 110.7(b)(4) (1995); (2) FEC Advisory Opinions that use the

word "coordinated" to describe the Party Expenditure Pro-vision's limitations, see,

e. g., FEC Advisory Op. 1984-15, 1
CCH Fed. Election Camp. Fin. Guide || 5766, p. 11,069 (May31, 1984) (AO 1984-15); FEC Advisory Op. 1988-22, 2 CCH

Fed. Election Camp. Fin. Guide || 5932, p. 11,471, n. 4 (July
5, 1988) (AO 1988-22); (3) one FEC Advisory Opinion thatsays explicitly in a footnote that "coordination with candidates is presumed and `independence' precluded," ibid.; and(4) a statement by this Court that "[p]arty committees are
considered incapable of making `independent' expenditures,"
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm., supra, at 28-29,
n. 1.

The Government argues, on the basis of these materials,
that the FEC has made an "empirical judgment that party
officials will as a matter of course consult with the party's
candidates before funding communications intended to influence the outcome of a federal election." Brief for Respondent 27. The FEC materials, however, do not make
this empirical judgment. For the most part those materials
use the word "coordinated" as a description that does not
necessarily deny the possibility that a party could also make
independent expenditures. See, e. g., AO 1984-15, || 5766,
at 11,069. We concede that one Advisory Opinion says, in
a footnote, that "coordination with candidates is presumed."
AO 1988-22, || 5932, at 11,471, n. 4. But this statement, like
the others, appears without any internal or external evidence that the FEC means it to embody an empirical judgment (say, that parties, in fact, hardly ever spend money
independently) or to represent the outcome of an empirical
investigation. Indeed, the statute does not require any such
investigation, for it applies both to coordinated and to independent expenditures alike. See $ 441a(d)(3) (a "political
party . . . may not make any expenditure" in excess of the
limits (emphasis added)). In any event, language in other
FEC Advisory Opinions suggests the opposite, namely, that
sometimes, in fact, parties do make independent expendi518us2$85Q 05-18-99 20:59:56 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Breyer, J.
tures. See, e. g., AO 1984-15, || 5766, at 11,069 ("Althoughconsultation or coordination with the candidate is permissible, it is not required"). In these circumstances, we cannottake the cited materials as an empirical, or experience-based,
determination that, as a factual matter, all party expenditures are coordinated with a candidate. That being so, weneed not hold, on the basis of these materials, that the expenditures here were "coordinated."The Government does not advance any other legal reason
that would require us to accept the FEC's characterization.The FEC has not claimed, for example, that, administratively
speaking, it is more difficult to separate a political party's
"independent," from its "coordinated," expenditures than,
say, those of a PAC. Cf. 11 CFR $ 109.1 (1995) (distinguishing between independent and coordinated expenditures by
other political groups). Nor can the FEC draw significant
legal support from the footnote in Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Comm., 454 U. S., at 28-29, n. 1, given that this
statement was dicta that purported to describe the regulatory regime as the FEC had described it in a brief.

Nor does the fact that the Party Expenditure Provision
fails to distinguish between coordinated and independent expenditures indicate a congressional judgment that such a distinction is impossible or untenable in the context of political
party spending. Instead, the use of the unmodified term
"expenditure" is explained by Congress' desire to limit all
party expenditures when it passed the 1974 amendments,
just as it had limited all expenditures by individuals, corporations, and other political groups. See 18 U. S. C. $$ 608(e),
610 (1970 ed., Supp. IV); Buckley, 424 U. S., at 39.

Finally, we recognize that the FEC may have characterized the expenditures as "coordinated" in light of this Court's
constitutional decisions prohibiting regulation of most independent expenditures. But, if so, the characterization cannot help the Government prove its case. An agency's simply
calling an independent expenditure a "coordinated expendi518us2$85Q 05-18-99 20:59:56 PAGES OPINPGT

ture" cannot (for constitutional purposes) make it one. See,
e. g., NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 429 (1963) (the government "cannot foreclose the exercise of constitutionalrights by mere labels");

Edwards v. South Carolina, 372
U. S. 229, 235-238 (1963) (State may not avoid First Amendment's strictures by applying the label "breach of the peace"to peaceful demonstrations).

The Government also argues that the Colorado Party hasconceded that the expenditures are "coordinated." But
there is no such concession in respect to the underlying facts.To the contrary, the Party's "Questions Presented" in its petition for certiorari describes the expenditure as one "the
party has not coordinated with its candidate." See Pet. for
Cert. i. In the lower courts the Party did accept the FEC's
terminology, but it did so in the context of legal arguments
that did not focus upon the constitutional distinction that we
now consider. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 9-10, n. 8
(denying that the FEC's labels can control constitutional
analysis). The Government has not referred us to any place
where the Party conceded away or abandoned its legal claim
that Congress may not limit the uncoordinated expenditure
at issue here. And, in any event, we are not bound to decide
a matter of constitutional law based on a concession by the
particular party before the Court as to the proper legal characterization of the facts. Cf. United States Nat. Bank of
Ore. v. Independent Ins. Agents of America, Inc., 508 U. S.
439, 447 (1993); Massachusetts v. United States, 333 U. S.
611, 623-628 (1948); Young v. United States, 315 U. S. 257,
259 (1942) (recognizing that "our judgments are precedents"
and that the proper understanding of matters of law "cannot
be left merely to the stipulation of parties").

Finally, the Government and supporting amici argue that
the expenditure is "coordinated" because a party and its candidate are identical, i. e., the party, in a sense, "is" its candidates. We cannot assume, however, that this is so. See,
e. g., W. Keefe, Parties, Politics, and Public Policy in America

Opinion of Breyer, J.
59-74 (5th ed. 1988) (describing parties as "coalitions" of dif-fering interests). Congress chose to treat candidates and

their parties quite differently under the Act, for example,by regulating contributions from one to the other. See

$ 441a(a)(2)(B). See also 11 CFR $$ 110.2, 110.3(b) (1995).And we are not certain whether a metaphysical identity
would help the Government, for in that case one might arguethat the absolute identity of views and interests eliminates
any potential for corruption, as would seem to be the casein the relationship between candidates and their campaign
committees. Cf. Buckley, supra, at 54-59 (Congress maynot limit expenditures by candidate/campaign committee);
First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 790(1978) (where there is no risk of "corruption" of a candidate,
the Government may not limit even contributions).

IV
The Colorado Party and supporting amici have argued abroader question than we have decided, for they have

claimed that, in the special case of political parties, the FirstAmendment forbids congressional efforts to limit coordinated expenditures as well as independent expenditures.Because the expenditure before us is an independent expenditure we have not reached this broader question in decidingthe Party's "as applied" challenge.

We recognize that the Party filed a counterclaim in whichit sought to raise a facial challenge to the Party Expenditure
Provision as a whole. But that counterclaim did not focusspecifically upon coordinated expenditures. See App. 68-69.
Nor did its summary judgment affidavits specifically allegethat the Party intended to make coordinated expenditures
exceeding the statute's limits. See id., at 159, || 4. Whilethis lack of focus does not deprive this Court of jurisdiction
to consider a facial challenge to the Party Expenditure Pro-vision as overbroad or as unconstitutional in all applications,
it does provide a prudential reason for this Court not to

Opinion of Breyer, J.

decide the broader question, especially since it may not benecessary to resolve the entire current dispute. If, in fact,

the Party wants to make only independent expenditureslike those before us, its counterclaim is mooted by our resolution of its "as applied" challenge. Cf. Renne v. Geary, 501
U. S. 312, 323-324 (1991) (facial challenge should generallynot be entertained when an "as-applied" challenge could resolve the case); Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S.491, 503-504 (1985).

More importantly, the opinions of the lower courts, and theparties' briefs in this case, did not squarely isolate, and address, party expenditures that in fact are coordinated, nor
did they examine, in that context, relevant similarities or
differences with similar expenditures made by individuals or
other political groups. Indeed, to our knowledge, this is the
first case in the 20-year history of the Party Expenditure
Provision to suggest that in-fact coordinated expenditures
by political parties are protected from congressional regulation by the First Amendment, even though this Court's
prior cases have permitted regulation of similarly coordinated expenditures by individuals and other political groups.
See Buckley, 424 U. S., at 46-47. This issue is complex. As
Justice Kennedy points out, post, at 629-630, party coordinated expenditures do share some of the constitutionally relevant features of independent expenditures. But many such
expenditures are also virtually indistinguishable from simple
contributions (compare, for example, a donation of money
with direct payment of a candidate's media bills, see Buckley,
supra, at 46). Moreover, political parties also share relevant
features with many PAC's, both having an interest in, and
devoting resources to, the goal of electing candidates who
will "work to further" a particular "political agenda," which
activity would benefit from coordination with those candidates. Post, at 630. See, e. g., NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 490 (describing the purpose and activities of the National Conservative PAC); id., at 492 (coordinated expenditures by PAC's are

subject to FECA contribution limitations). Thus, a holdingon in-fact coordinated party expenditures necessarily implicates a broader range of issues than may first appear, includ-ing the constitutionality of party contribution limits.

But the focus of this litigation, and of the lower court opinions, has not been on such issues, but rather on whether theGovernment may conclusively deem independent party expenditures to be coordinated. This lack of focus may reflect,in part, the litigation strategy of the parties. The Government has denied that any distinction can be made between aparty's independent and its coordinated expenditures. The
Colorado Party, for its part, did not challenge a different provision of the statute--a provision that imposes a $5,000 limit
on any contribution by a "multicandidate political committee" (including a coordinated expenditure) and which would
apply to party coordinated expenditures if the entire Party
Expenditure Provision were struck from the statute as unconstitutional. See $$ 441a(a)(2), (4), (7)(B)(i). Rather than
challenging the constitutionality of this provision as well,
thereby making clear that it was challenging Congress' authority to regulate in-fact coordinated party expenditures,
the Party has made an obscure severability argument that
would leave party coordinated expenditures exempt from
that provision. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 11, n. 9.
While these strategies do not deprive the parties of a right
to adjudicate the counterclaim, they do provide a reason for
this Court to defer consideration of the broader issues until
the lower courts have reconsidered the question in light of
our current opinion.

Finally, we note that neither the parties nor the lower
courts have considered whether or not Congress would have
wanted the Party Expenditure Provision's limitations to stand
were they to apply only to coordinated, and not to independent, expenditures. See Buckley, supra, at 108; NCPAC,
supra, at 498. This nonconstitutional ground for exempting party coordinated expenditures from FECA limitations

should be briefed and considered before addressing theconstitutionality of such regulation. See United States v.

Locke, 471 U. S. 84, 92, and n. 9 (1985).

Justice Thomas disagrees and would reach the broaderconstitutional question notwithstanding the above prudential

considerations. In fact, he would reach a great number ofissues neither addressed below, nor presented by the facts of
this case, nor raised by the parties, for he believes it appro-priate here to overrule sua sponte this Court's entire campaign finance jurisprudence, developed in numerous casesover the last 20 years. See post, at 635-644. Doing so
seems inconsistent with this Court's view that it is ordinarily"inappropriate for us to reexamine" prior precedent "without the benefit of the parties' briefing," since the "principlesthat animate our policy of

stare decisis caution against over-ruling a longstanding precedent on a theory not argued by

the parties." United States v. International Business Ma-chines Corp., 517 U. S. 843, 855, 856 (1996). In our view,
given the important competing interests involved in cam-paign finance issues, we should proceed cautiously, consistent
with this precedent, and remand for further proceedings.For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals
is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.

It is so ordered.
Justice Kennedy, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Scalia join, concurring in the judgment and dissenting in part.

In agreement with Justice Thomas, post, at 631-634, I
would hold that the Colorado Republican Party (Party), inits pleadings in the District Court and throughout this litigation, has preserved its claim that the constraints imposed bythe Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), both on
its face and as interpreted by the Federal Elections Commis-sion (FEC), violate the First Amendment.

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
In the principal opinion's view, the FEC's conclusive pre-sumption that all political party spending relating to identified candidates is "coordinated" cannot be squared with theFirst Amendment.

Ante, at 619-623. The principal opinion finds the presumption invalid, and I agree with much of
the reasoning behind that conclusion. The quarrel over theFEC's presumption is beside the point, however, for under

the statute it is both burdensome and quite unrealistic fora political party to attempt the expenditure of funds on a
candidate's behalf (or against other candidates) without run-ning afoul of FECA's spending limitations.

Indeed, the principal opinion's reasoning with respect to
the presumption illuminates the deficiencies in the statutory
provision as a whole as it constrains the speech and political
activities of political parties. The presumption is a logical,
though invalid, implementation of the statute, which restricts as a "contribution" a political party's spending "in
cooperation, consultation, or concert, with, or at the request
or suggestion of, a candidate, his authorized political committees, or their agents." 2 U. S. C. $ 441a(a)(7)(B)(i). While
the statutory provision applies to any "person," its obvious
purpose and effect when applied to political parties, as the
FEC's presumption reflects, is to restrict any party's spending in a specific campaign for or against a candidate and so
to burden a party in expending its own money for its own
speech.

The central holding in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976)
(per curiam), is that spending money on one's own speech
must be permitted, id., at 44-58, and this is what political
parties do when they make the expenditures FECA restricts. FECA calls spending of this nature a "contribution," $ 441a(a)(7)(B)(i), and it is true that contributions can
be restricted consistent with Buckley, supra, at 23-38. As
the principal opinion acknowledges, however, and as our
cases hold, we cannot allow the Government's suggested
labels to control our First Amendment analysis. Ante, at

621-622. See also, e. g., Landmark Communications, Inc.v.

Virginia, 435 U. S. 829, 843 (1978) ("Deference to a legislative finding cannot limit judicial inquiry when First Amend-ment rights are at stake"). In

Buckley, we concluded that
contribution limitations imposed only "marginal restriction[s]" on the contributor's First Amendment rights, 424U. S., at 20, because certain attributes of contributions make

them less like "speech" for First Amendment purposes:

"A contribution serves as a general expression of sup-port for the candidate and his views, but does not communicate the underlying basis for the support. The
quantity of communication by the contributor does notincrease perceptibly with the size of his contribution,

since the expression rests solely on the undifferentiated,symbolic act of contributing. At most, the size of the
contribution provides a very rough index of the intensityof the contributor's support for the candidate. A limitation on the amount of money a person may give to a
candidate or campaign organization thus involves littledirect restraint on his political communication, for it permits the symbolic expression of support evidenced by acontribution but does not in any way infringe the contributor's freedom to discuss candidates and issues.While contributions may result in political expression if
spent by a candidate or an association to present viewsto the voters, the transformation of contributions into
political debate involves speech by someone other than
the contributor." Id., at 21 (footnote omitted).

We had no occasion in Buckley to consider possible First
Amendment objections to limitations on spending by parties.
Id., at 58, n. 66. While our cases uphold contribution limitations on individuals and associations, see id., at 23-38; California Medical Assn. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 453 U. S.

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
date does not fit within our description of "contributions" in
Buckley. In my view, we should not transplant the reasoning of cases upholding ordinary contribution limitations toa case involving FECA's restrictions on political party

spending.

The First Amendment embodies a "profound national com-mitment to the principle that debate on public issues should

be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open." New York Times
Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 270 (1964). Political parties
have a unique role in serving this principle; they exist toadvance their members' shared political beliefs. See,

e. g.,
Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm.,
489 U. S. 214 (1989); Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U. S. 234,
250 (1957). Cf. Morse v. Republican Party of Va., 517 U. S.
186, 250-251 (1996) (Kennedy, J., dissenting). A party performs this function, in part, by "identify[ing] the people who
constitute the association, and . . . limit[ing] the association
to those people only." Democratic Party of United States
v. Wisconsin ex rel. La Follette, 450 U. S. 107, 122 (1981).
Having identified its members, however, a party can give
effect to their views only by selecting and supporting candidates. A political party has its own traditions and principles
that transcend the interests of individual candidates and
campaigns; but in the context of particular elections, candidates are necessary to make the party's message known and
effective, and vice versa.

It makes no sense, therefore, to ask, as FECA does, whether
a party's spending is made "in cooperation, consultation, or
concert with" its candidate. The answer in most cases will be
yes, but that provides more, not less, justification for holding
unconstitutional the statute's attempt to control this type of
party spending, which bears little resemblance to the contributions discussed in Buckley. Supra, at 627-628 and this
page. Party spending "in cooperation, consultation, or concert with" its candidates of necessity "communicate[s] the underlying basis for the support," 424 U. S., at 21, i. e., the hope

that he or she will be elected and will work to further the
party's political agenda.

The problem is not just the absence of a basis in our First
Amendment cases for treating the party's spending as contributions. The greater difficulty posed by the statute is its
stifling effect on the ability of the party to do what it exists
to do. It is fanciful to suppose that limiting party spending
of the type at issue here "does not in any way infringe the
contributor's freedom to discuss candidates and issues,"
ibid., since it would be impractical and imprudent, to say the
least, for a party to support its own candidates without some
form of "cooperation" or "consultation." The party's speech,
legitimate on its own behalf, cannot be separated from
speech on the candidate's behalf without constraining the
party in advocating its most essential positions and pursuing
its most basic goals. The party's form of organization and
the fact that its fate in an election is inextricably intertwined
with that of its candidates cannot provide a basis for the
restrictions imposed here. See Federal Election Comm'n
v. National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S.

480, 494-495 (1985).

We have a constitutional tradition of political parties and
their candidates engaging in joint First Amendment activity;
we also have a practical identity of interests between the two
entities during an election. Party spending "in cooperation,
consultation, or concert with" a candidate therefore is indistinguishable in substance from expenditures by the candidate or his campaign committee. We held in Buckley that
the First Amendment does not permit regulation of the latter, see 424 U. S., at 54-59, and it should not permit this
regulation of the former. Congress may have authority,
consistent with the First Amendment, to restrict undifferentiated political party contributions which satisfy the constitutional criteria we discussed in Buckley, but that type of regulation is not at issue here.

I would resolve the Party's First Amendment claim inaccord with these principles rather than remit the Party to

further protracted proceedings. Because the principal opin-ion would do otherwise, I concur only in the judgment.

Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Scalia join as to Parts I and III, concurring in thejudgment and dissenting in part.

I agree that petitioners' rights under the First Amend-ment have been violated, but I think we should reach the
facial challenge in this case in order to make clear the cir-cumstances under which political parties may engage in political speech without running afoul of 2 U. S. C. $ 441a(d)(3).In resolving that challenge, I would reject the framework
established by Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per cu-riam), for analyzing the constitutionality of campaign finance laws and hold that $ 441a(d)(3)'s limits on independentand coordinated expenditures fail strict scrutiny. But even
under Buckley, $ 441a(d)(3) cannot stand, because the anti-corruption rationale that we have relied upon in sustaining
other campaign finance laws is inapplicable where politicalparties are the subject of such regulation.

I
As an initial matter, I write to make clear that we shoulddecide the Colorado Republican Party's (Party's) facial challenge to $ 441a(d)(3) and thus address the constitutionality oflimits on coordinated expenditures by political parties.

Justice Breyer's reasons for not reaching the facial consti-tutionality of the statute are unpersuasive. In addition, concerns for the chilling of First Amendment expression counselin favor of resolving that question.

After the Federal Election Commission (FEC) broughtthis action against the Party, the Party counterclaimed that

are unconstitutional, both facially and as applied." App. 68.Though

Justice Breyer faults the Party for not "focus[ing]specifically upon coordinated expenditures,"

ante, at 623,the term "expenditures" certainly includes both coordinated

as well as independent expenditures.1 See 2 U. S. C.$ 431(9)(A) ("The term `expenditure' includes . . .

any pur-chase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift

of money or anything of value, made by any person for thepurpose of influencing any election for Federal office" (emphasis added)). Moreover, at the time the Party filed itscounterclaim, all party expenditures were treated by law as
coordinated, see Federal Election Comm'n v. Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Comm., 454 U. S. 27, 28-29, n. 1(1981), so a reference to expenditures by a party was tantamount to a reference to coordinated expenditures.Given the liberal nature of the rules governing civil pleading, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8, the Party's straightforwardallegation of the unconstitutionality of $ 441a(d)(3)'s expenditure limits clearly suffices to raise the claim that neitherindependent nor coordinated expenditures may be regulated
consistently with the First Amendment. Indeed, that isprecisely how the Court of Appeals appears to have read the
counterclaim. The court expressly said that it was "analyz-ing the constitutionality of limits on coordinated expenditures by political committees," 59 F. 3d 1015, 1024 (CA101995), under $ 441a(d)(3).

For the same reasons, the fact that the Party's summaryjudgment affidavits did not "specifically allege," ante, at 623,
that the Party intended to make coordinated expendituresis also immaterial. The affidavits made clear that, but for

1 Justice Breyer acknowledges as much when he asserts earlier in
his opinion that "the unmodified term `expenditure' " reflects a congressional intent "to limit all party expenditures." Ante, at 621 (emphasis
in original).

$ 441a(d)(3), the Party would spend in excess of the limitsimposed by that statute, see App. 159 ("[T]he State Party

intends to pay for communications within the spending limitsof [$ 441]. . . . However, the State Party would also like to
pay for communications which costs [sic] exceed the spending limits of [$ 441a(d)], but will not do so due to the deter-rent and chilling effect of the statute"), as did the Party's

brief in this Court, see Brief for Petitioners 23-24 ("The Col-orado Party is ready, willing and able to make expenditures
expressly advocating the election or defeat of candidates forfederal office that would exceed the limits imposed by

$ 441a(d), but it has been deterred from doing so by the obvious and credible threat of FEC enforcement actions").

Finally, though Justice Breyer notes that this is the first
Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) case to raise
the constitutional validity of limits on coordinated expenditures, see ante, at 624, that is, at best, an argument against
granting certiorari. It is too late for arguments like that
now. The case is here, and we needlessly protract this litigation by remanding this important issue to the Court of
Appeals. Nor is the fact that the "issue is complex," ibid.,
a good reason for avoiding it. We do not sit to decide only
easy cases. And while it may be true that no court has ever
asked whether expenditures that are "in fact" coordinated
may be regulated under the First Amendment, see ibid., I
do not see how the existence of an "in fact" coordinated
expenditure would change our analysis of the facial constitutionality of $ 441a(d)(3), since courts in facial challenges
under the First Amendment routinely consider applications of the relevant statute other than the application before
the court. See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 612
(1973). Whether or not there are facts in the record to support the finding that this particular expenditure was actually
coordinated with a candidate, we are not, contrary to the
suggestion of Justice Breyer, incapable of considering

the Government's interest in regulating such expenditures

and testing the fit between that end and the means used to
achieve it.2

The validity of $ 441a(d)(3)'s controls on coordinated expenditures is an open question that, if left unanswered, will
inhibit the exercise of legitimate First Amendment activity
nationwide. All Justice Breyer resolves is that when a
political party spends money in support of a candidate (or
against his opponent) and the Government cannot thereafter
prove any coordination between the party and the candidate,
the party cannot be punished by the Government for that
spending. This settles little, if anything. Parties are left
to wonder whether their speech is protected by the First
Amendment when the Government can show--presumably
with circumstantial evidence--a link between the party and
the candidate with respect to the speech in question. And
of course, one of the main purposes of a political party is to
support its candidates in elections.

The constitutionality of limits on coordinated expenditures
by political parties is squarely before us. We should address
this important question now, instead of leaving political parties in a state of uncertainty about the types of First Amendment expression in which they are free to engage.

2 Justice Breyer's remaining arguments for avoiding the facial challenge are straw men. See ante, at 625 (if $ 441a(d)(3) were invalidated in
its entirety, other FECA provisions that the Party has not challenged
might apply to coordinated party expenditures); ibid. (if $ 441a(d)(3) were
upheld as to coordinated expenditures but invalidated as to independent
expenditures, issues of severability would be raised). That resolution of
the primary question in this case (the constitutionality of $ 441a(d)(3) with
respect to all expenditures) might generate issues not previously considered (such as severability) is no reason for not deciding the question itself.
Without suggesting that remand is the only appropriate way to deal with
possible corollary matters in this case or that these arguments have merit,
I point out that we can, of course, decide the central question without
ruling on the issues that concern Justice Breyer.

A

Critical to Justice Breyer's reasoning is the distinctionbetween contributions

3 and independent expenditures that

we first drew in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per
curiam). Though we said in Buckley that controls on
spending and giving "operate in an area of the most fundamental First Amendment activities," id., at 14, we invalidated the expenditure limits of FECA and upheld the Act's
contribution limits. The justification we gave for the differing results was this: "The expenditure limitations . . . represent substantial rather than merely theoretical restraints on
the quantity and diversity of political speech," id., at 19,
whereas "limitation[s] upon the amount that any one person
or group may contribute to a candidate or political committee
entai[l] only a marginal restriction upon the contributor's
ability to engage in free communication," id., at 20-21. This
conclusion was supported mainly by two assertions about the
nature of contributions: First, though contributions may result in speech, that speech is by the candidate and not by the
contributor; and second, contributions express only general
support for the candidate but do not communicate the reasons for that support. Id., at 21. Since Buckley, our campaign finance jurisprudence has been based in large part on
this distinction between contributions and expenditures.
See, e. g., Federal Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc. (MCFL), 479 U. S. 238, 259-260, 261-262
(1986); Federal Election Comm'n v. National Conservative
Political Action Comm. (NCPAC), 470 U. S. 480, 497 (1985);

3 Coordinated expenditures are by statute categorized as contributions.
See 2 U. S. C. $ 441a(a)(7)(B)(i) ("[E]xpenditures made by any person in
cooperation, consultation, or concert, with, or at the request or suggestion
of, a candidate, his authorized political committees, or their agents, shall
be considered to be a contribution to such candidate").

California Medical Assn. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 453U. S. 182, 196 (1981) (plurality opinion).

In my view, the distinction lacks constitutional signifi-cance, and I would not adhere to it. As Chief Justice Burger
put it: "[C]ontributions and expenditures are two sides of thesame First Amendment coin."

Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S.,at 241 (concurring in part and dissenting in part).

4 Contributions and expenditures both involve core First Amend-ment expression because they further the "[d]iscussion of

public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates. . . integral to the operation of the system of government
established by our Constitution." Id., at 14. When an indi-vidual donates money to a candidate or to a partisan organization, he enhances the donee's ability to communicate a mes-sage and thereby adds to political debate, just as when that
individual communicates the message himself. Indeed, theindividual may add more to political discourse by giving
rather than spending, if the donee is able to put the funds tomore productive use than can the individual. The contribution of funds to a candidate or to a political group thus fostersthe "free discussion of governmental affairs,"

Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S. 214, 218 (1966), just as an expenditure does.5

4 Three Members of the Buckley Court thought the distinction untenable
at the time, see 424 U. S., at 241 (Burger, C. J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part); id., at 261 (White, J., concurring in part and dissenting
in part); id., at 290 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in
part), and another Member disavowed it subsequently, see Federal Election Comm'n v. NCPAC, 470 U. S. 480, 518-521 (1985) (Marshall, J., dissenting). Cf. Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U. S. 652,
678 (1990) (Stevens, J., concurring) (stating that distinction "should have
little, if any, weight in reviewing corporate participation in candidate
elections").

Giving and spending in the electoral process also involvebasic associational rights under the First Amendment. See

BeVier, Money and Politics: A Perspective on the FirstAmendment and Campaign Finance Reform, 73 Calif. L. Rev.
1045, 1064 (1985) (hereinafter BeVier). As we acknowl-edged in

Buckley, " `[e]ffective advocacy of both public andprivate points of view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by group association.' " 424 U. S., at 15(quoting NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S.
449, 460 (1958)). Political associations allow citizens to pooltheir resources and make their advocacy more effective, and
such efforts are fully protected by the First Amendment.
Federal Election Comm'n v. NCPAC, supra, at 494. If anindividual is limited in the amount of resources he can contribute to the pool, he is most certainly limited in his abilityto associate for purposes of effective advocacy. See Citizens
Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berke-ley, 454 U. S. 290, 296 (1981) ("To place a . . . limit . . . on
individuals wishing to band together to advance their views. . . is clearly a restraint on the right of association"). And
if an individual cannot be subject to such limits, neither canpolitical associations be limited in their ability to give as a
means of furthering their members' viewpoints. As wehave said, "[a]ny interference with the freedom of a party is
simultaneously an interference with the freedom of its adher-ents."

tions may be necessary, and they are costly. By extension, then, the contribution of money is a contribution to freedom of political debate."

6 To illustrate the point that giving and spending in the political process

implicate the same First Amendment values, I note that virtually everything Justice Breyer says about the importance of free independent
expenditures applies with equal force to coordinated expenditures and contributions. For instance, Justice Breyer states that "[a] political party's independent expression not only reflects its members' views about the
philosophical and governmental matters that bind them together, it also
seeks to convince others to join those members in a practical democratic

COMM. v. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N

Opinion of Thomas, J.

Turning from similarities to differences, I can discernonly one potentially meaningful distinction between contributions and expenditures. In the former case, the fundspass through an intermediary--some individual or entity responsible for organizing and facilitating the dissemination ofthe message--whereas in the latter case they may not necessarily do so. But the practical judgment by a citizen thatanother person or an organization can more effectively deploy funds for the good of a common cause than he can oughtnot deprive that citizen of his First Amendment rights.
Whether an individual donates money to a candidate or
group who will use it to promote the candidate or whether
the individual spends the money to promote the candidatehimself, the individual seeks to engage in political expression

and to associate with like-minded persons. A contributionis simply an indirect expenditure; though contributions and
expenditures may thus differ in form, they do not differ insubstance. As one commentator cautioned, "let us not lose
sight of the speech." Powe, Mass Speech and the NewerFirst Amendment, 1982 S. Ct. Rev. 243, 258.

Echoing the suggestion in Buckley that contributions have
less First Amendment value than expenditures because theydo not involve speech by the donor, see 424 U. S., at 21, the

Court has sometimes rationalized limitations on contribu-tions by referring to contributions as "speech by proxy."
See, e. g., California Medical Assn. v. Federal Election
Comm'n, 453 U. S., at 196 (Marshall, J.) (plurality opinion).
The "speech by proxy" label is, however, an ineffective toolfor distinguishing contributions from expenditures. Even in

the case of a direct expenditure, there is usually some gotask, the task of creating a government that voters can instruct and hold
responsible for subsequent success or failure." Ante, at 615-616. "Coordinated" expression by political parties, of course, shares those precise
attributes. The fact that an expenditure is prearranged with the candidate--presumably to make it more effective in the election--does not take
away from its fundamental democratic purposes.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
between that facilitates the dissemination of the spender'smessage--for instance, an advertising agency or a television

station. See Powe, supra, at 258-259. To call a contribu-tion "speech by proxy" thus does little to differentiate it from
an expenditure. See Buckley v. Valeo, supra, at 243-244,
and n. 7 (Burger, C. J., concurring in part and dissentingin part). The only possible difference is that contributions

involve an extra step in the proxy chain. But again, that isa difference in form, not substance.

Moreover, we have recently recognized that where the"proxy" speech is endorsed by those who give, that speech
is a fully protected exercise of the donors' associationalrights. In

Federal Elect ion Comm'n v. NCPAC, we
explained:

"[T]he `proxy speech' approach is not useful . . . [where]
the contributors obviously like the message they arehearing from [the] organizatio[n] and want to add their

voices to that message; otherwise they would not part
with their money. To say that their collective actionin pooling their resources to amplify their voices is not

entitled to full First Amendment protection would sub-ordinate the voices of those of modest means as opposed
to those sufficiently wealthy to be able to buy expensivemedia ads with their own resources." 470 U. S., at 495.

The other justification in Buckley for the proposition thatcontribution caps only marginally restrict speech--that is,
that a contribution signals only general support for the can-didate but indicates nothing about the reasons for that support--is similarly unsatisfying. Assuming the assertion is
descriptively accurate (which is certainly questionable), it
still cannot mean that giving is less important than spending
in terms of the First Amendment. A campaign poster that
reads simply "We support candidate Smith" does not seem
to me any less deserving of constitutional protection than
one that reads "We support candidate Smith because we like

his position on agriculture subsidies." Both express a politi-cal opinion. Even a pure message of support, unadorned

with reasons, is valuable to the democratic process.In sum, unlike the Buckley Court, I believe that contribution limits infringe as directly and as seriously upon freedomof political expression and association as do expenditure limits. The protections of the First Amendment do not dependupon so fine a line as that between spending money to support a candidate or group and giving money to the candidateor group to spend for the same purpose. In principle, people
and groups give money to candidates and other groups forthe same reason that they spend money in support of those
candidates and groups: because they share social, economic,and political beliefs and seek to have those beliefs affect governmental policy. I think that the Buckley framework foranalyzing the constitutionality of campaign finance laws is
deeply flawed. Accordingly, I would not employ it, as Justice Breyer and Justice Kennedy do.

B
Instead, I begin with the premise that there is no consti-tutionally significant difference between campaign contributions and expenditures: Both forms of speech are centralto the First Amendment. Curbs on protected speech, we
have repeatedly said, must be strictly scrutinized. See Federal Election Comm'n v. NCPAC, supra, at 501; CitizensAgainst Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berkeley, 454 U. S., at 294; First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,435 U. S. 765, 786 (1978).

7 I am convinced that under tradi7 In Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976), the Court purported to scrutinize strictly the contribution provisions as well as the expenditure rules.
See id., at 23 (FECA's contribution and expenditures limits "both implicate fundamental First Amendment interests"); id., at 25 (contribution limits, like expenditure limits, are " `subject to the closest scrutiny' " (citation
omitted)). It has not gone unnoticed, however, that we seemed more forgiving in our review of the contribution provisions than of the expenditure
rules. See, e. g., California Medical Assn. v. Federal Election Comm'n,

Opinion of Thomas, J.
tional strict scrutiny, broad prophylactic caps on both spend-ing and giving in the political process, like $ 441a(d)(3), are

unconstitutional.The formula for strict scrutiny is, of course, well established. It requires both a compelling governmental interestand legislative means narrowly tailored to serve that interest. In the context of campaign finance reform, the onlygovernmental interest that we have accepted as compelling
is the prevention of corruption or the appearance of corrup-tion, see

Federal Election Comm'n v. NCPAC, 470 U. S., at496-497, and we have narrowly defined "corruption" as a

"financial quid pro quo: dollars for political favors," id., at497.

8 As for the means-ends fit under strict scrutiny, we

have specified that "[w]here at all possible, government mustcurtail speech only to the degree necessary to meet the particular problem at hand, and must avoid infringing on speechthat does not pose the danger that has prompted regulation."
Federal Election Comm'n v. MCFL, 479 U. S., at 265.In

Buckley, we expressly stated that the means adoptedmust be "closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment" of

First Amendment rights. 424 U. S., at 25. But the Buck-ley Court summarily rejected the argument that, because
less restrictive means of preventing corruption existed--forinstance, bribery laws and disclosure requirements--FECA's
contribution provisions were invalid. Bribery laws, theCourt said, "deal with only the most blatant and specific
attempts of those with money to influence governmentalaction,"

id., at 28, suggesting that those means were inade453 U. S. 182, 196 (1981) (plurality opinion) (contributions are "not the sort
of political advocacy that this Court in Buckley found entitled to full First
Amendment protection"). But see id., at 201-202 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (under Buckley, there is no lesser
standard of review for contributions as opposed to expenditures).

8 As I explain in Part III, infra, the interest in preventing corruption is

inapplicable when the subject of the regulation is a political party. My
analysis here is more general, however, and applies to all individuals and
entities subject to campaign finance limits.

quate to serve the governmental interest. With respect todisclosure rules, the Court admitted that they serve "many

salutary purposes" but said that Congress was "entitledto conclude that disclosure was only a partial measure, and
that contribution ceilings were a necessary legislative concomitant." Ibid. Finally, the Court noted that contribu-tion caps leave people free to engage in independent political

speech, to volunteer their services, and to contribute moneyto a "limited but nonetheless substantial extent."

Ibid.
In my opinion, FECA's monetary caps fail the narrowtailoring test. Addressing the constitutionality of FECA's

contribution caps, the Buckley appellants argued:

"If a small minority of political contributions are given
to secure appointments for the donors or some other
quid pro quo, that cannot serve to justify prohibiting all
large contributions, the vast majority of which are givennot for any such purpose but to further the expression

of political views which the candidate and donor share.
Where First Amendment rights are involved, a blunder-buss approach which prohibits mostly innocent speech

cannot be held a means narrowly and precisely directedto the governmental interest in the small minority of
contributions that are not innocent." Brief for Appel-lants in

Buckley v. Valeo, O. T. 1975, Nos. 75-436 and
75-437, pp. 117-118.

The Buckley appellants were, to my mind, correct. Broad
prophylactic bans on campaign expenditures and contribu-tions are not designed with the precision required by the

First Amendment because they sweep protected speech
within their prohibitions.

Section 441a(d)(3), in particular, suffers from this infirmity.
It flatly bans all expenditures by all national and state party
committees in excess of certain dollar limits, without any
evidence that covered committees who exceed those limits
are in fact engaging, or likely to engage, in bribery or any518us2$85N 05-18-99 20:59:56 PAGES OPINPGT

thing resembling it. See Austin v. Michigan Chamber of
Commerce, 494 U. S. 652, 689 (1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting)
(where statute "extends to speech that has the mere potential for producing social harm" it should not be held to satisfy
the narrow tailoring requirement (emphasis in original)).
Thus, the statute indiscriminately covers the many conceiv-able instances in which a party committee could exceed the

spending limits without any intent to extract an unlawfulcommitment from a candidate. Cf.

Schaumburg v. Citizens
for a Better Environment, 444 U. S. 620, 637 (1980) (Statemay not, in effort to stop fraud in charitable solicitations,

"lump" truly charitable organizations "with those that in fact
are using the charitable label as a cloak for profitmaking and
refuse to employ more precise measures to separate one kind
from the other"). As one commentator has observed: "[I]t
must not be forgotten that a large number of contributions
are made without any hope of specific gain: for the promotion
of a program, because of enthusiasm for a candidate, or to
promote what the giver vaguely conceives to be the national
interest." L. Overacker, Money in Elections 192 (1974).

In contrast, federal bribery laws are designed to punish
and deter the corrupt conduct the Government seeks to prevent under FECA, and disclosure laws work to make donors
and donees accountable to the public for any questionable
financial dealings in which they may engage. Cf. Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, supra, at 637-638
(explaining that "less intrusive" means of preventing fraud
in charitable solicitation are "the penal laws [that can be]
used to punish such conduct directly" and "disclosure of the
finances of charitable organizations"). In light of these
alternatives, wholesale limitations that cover contributions
having nothing to do with bribery--but with speech central
to the First Amendment--are not narrowly tailored.

Buckley's rationale for the contrary conclusion, see supra,
at 641-642, is faulty. That bribery laws are not completely
effective in stamping out corruption is no justification for the

conclusion that prophylactic controls on funding activity arenarrowly tailored. The First Amendment limits Congress

to legislative measures that do not abridge the Amendment'sguaranteed freedoms, thereby constraining Congress' ability
to accomplish certain goals. Similarly, that other modes ofexpression remain open to regulated individuals or groups
does not mean that a statute is the least restrictive meansof addressing a particular social problem. A statute could,
of course, be more restrictive than necessary while still leav-ing open some avenues for speech.

Were I convinced that the Buckley framework rested on aprincipled distinction between contributions and expenditures, which I am not, I would nevertheless conclude that$ 441a(d)(3)'s limits on political parties violate the First
Amendment. Under Buckley and its progeny, a substantialthreat of corruption must exist before a law purportedly

9 Justice Stevens submits that we should "accord special deference to
[Congress'] judgment on questions related to the extent and nature of
limits on campaign spending," post, at 650, a stance that the Court of
Appeals also adopted, see 59 F. 3d 1015, 1024 (CA10 1995). This position
poses great risk to the First Amendment, in that it amounts to letting the
fox stand watch over the henhouse. There is good reason to think that
campaign reform is an especially inappropriate area for judicial deference
to legislative judgment. See generally BeVier 1074-1081. What the argument for deference fails to acknowledge is the potential for legislators
to set the rules of the electoral game so as to keep themselves in power
and to keep potential challengers out of it. See id., at 1075 (" `Courts
must police inhibitions on . . . political activity because we cannot trust

increase the influence of special interest groups. See BeVier 1078-1080.
When Congress seeks to ration political expression in the electoral process, we ought not simply acquiesce in its judgment.

10 Just as some of the

monetary limits in the Buckley line of cases were held tobe invalid because the Government interest in stemming corruption was inadequate under the circumstances to justifythe restrictions on speech, so too is $ 441a(d)(3) invalid.

11

The Government asserts that the purpose of $ 441a(d)(3) isto prevent the corruption of candidates and elected representatives by party officials. The Government does not ex-plain precisely what it means by "corruption," however;

12 the

closest thing to an explanation the Government offers is that"corruption" is " `the real or imagined coercive influence of

large financial contributions on candidates' positions and ontheir actions if elected to office.' " Brief for Respondent 35
(quoting Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 25). We so defined

10 See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 45-47 (striking down limits on independent expenditures because the "advocacy restricted by the provision
does not presently appear to pose dangers of real or apparent corruption");
Federal Election Comm'n v. MCFL, 479 U. S. 238, 263 (1986) (invalidating
caps on campaign expenditures by incorporated political associations because spending by such groups "does not pose [any] threat" of corruption);
Federal Election Comm'n v. NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 498 (striking down limits on independent expenditures by political action committees because "a
quid pro quo for improper commitments" in that context was a "hypothetical possibility"); Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berkeley, 454 U. S. 290, 297 (1981) (stating that "Buckley does not
support limitations on contributions to committees formed to favor or oppose ballot measures" because anticorruption rationale is inapplicable);
First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 790 (1978) (concluding
that limits on referendum speech by corporations violate First Amendment because "[t]he risk of corruption . . . simply is not present").

11 While Justice Breyer chides me for taking the position that I

would not adhere to Buckley, see ante, at 626, and suggests that my

approach to this case is thus insufficiently "cautiou[s]," ibid., he ignores
this Part of my opinion, in which I explain why limits on coordinated
expenditures are unconstitutional even under the Buckley line of
precedent.

12 Nor, for that matter, does Justice Breyer explain what sorts of quid

pro quos a party could extract from a candidate. Cf. ante, at 615.

corruption in Buckley for purposes of reviewing ceilings ongiving or spending by individuals, groups, political committees, and candidates. See id., at 23, 35, 39. But we did notin that case consider the First Amendment status of FECA's
provisions dealing with political parties. See id., at 58,
n. 66, 59, n. 67.As applied in the specific context of campaign funding by

political parties, the anticorruption rationale loses its force.See Nahra, Political Parties and the Campaign Finance
Laws: Dilemmas, Concerns and Opportunities, 56 Ford. L.Rev. 53, 105-106 (1987). What could it mean for a party to
"corrupt" its candidate or to exercise "coercive" influence
over him? The very aim of a political party is to influence
its candidate's stance on issues and, if the candidate takes
office or is reelected, his votes. When political parties
achieve that aim, that achievement does not, in my view, constitute "a subversion of the political process." Federal Election Comm'n v. NCPAC, 470 U. S., at 497. For instance, if
the Democratic Party spends large sums of money in support
of a candidate who wins, takes office, and then implements
the Party's platform, that is not corruption; that is successful
advocacy of ideas in the political marketplace and representative government in a party system. To borrow a
phrase from Federal Election Comm'n v. NCPAC: "The fact
that candidates and elected officials may alter or reaffirm
their own positions on issues in response to political messages paid for by [political groups] can hardly be called corruption, for one of the essential features of democracy is the
presentation to the electorate of varying points of view."
Id., at 498. Cf. Federal Election Comm'n v. MCFL, 479
U. S., at 263 (suggesting that "[v]oluntary political associations do not . . . present the specter of corruption").

The structure of political parties is such that the theoretical danger of those groups actually engaging in quid pro
quos with candidates is significantly less than the threat of
individuals or other groups doing so. See Nahra, supra, at

Opinion of Thomas, J.
97-98 (citing F. Sorauf, Party Politics in America 15-18 (5thed. 1984)). American political parties, generally speaking,

have numerous members with a wide variety of interests,Nahra,

supra, at 98, features necessary for success in majoritarian elections. Consequently, the influence of any one
person or the importance of any single issue within a politicalparty is significantly diffused. For this reason, as the Party's amici argue, see Brief for Committee for Party Renewalet al. as

Amicus Curiae 16, campaign funds donated by parties are considered to be some of "the cleanest money in poli-tics." J. Bibby, Campaign Finance Reform, 6 Commonsense

1, 10 (Dec. 1983). And, as long as the Court continues to
permit Congress to subject individuals to limits on the
amount they can give to parties, and those limits are uniform
as to all donors, see 2 U. S. C. $ 441a(a)(1), there is little risk
that an individual donor could use a party as a conduit for
bribing candidates.

In any event, the Government, which bears the burden of
"demonstrat[ing] that the recited harms are real, not merely
conjectural," Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512
U. S. 622, 664 (1994), has identified no more proof of the corrupting dangers of coordinated expenditures than it has of
independent expenditures. Cf. ante, at 618 ("The Government does not point to record evidence or legislative findings
suggesting any special corruption problem in respect to independent party expenditures"). And insofar as it appears
that Congress did not actually enact $ 441a(d)(3) in order to
stop corruption by political parties "but rather for the constitutionally insufficient purpose of reducing what it saw as
wasteful and excessive campaign spending," ibid. (citing
Buckley v. Valeo, supra, at 57), the statute's ceilings on coordinated expenditures are as unwarranted as the caps on
independent expenditures.

In sum, there is only a minimal threat of "corruption," as
we have understood that term, when a political party spends
to support its candidate or to oppose his competitor, whether

or not that expenditure is made in concert with the candi-date. Parties and candidates have traditionally worked together to achieve their common goals, and when they engagein that work, there is no risk to the Republic. To the contrary, the danger to the Republic lies in Government sup-pression of such activity. Under

Buckley and our subse-quent cases, $ 441a(d)(3)'s heavy burden on First Amendment

rights is not justified by the threat of corruption at which itis assertedly aimed.

* * *
To conclude, I would find $ 441a(d)(3) unconstitutional notjust as applied to petitioners, but also on its face. Accordingly, I concur only in the Court's judgment.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,dissenting.

In my opinion, all money spent by a political party to se-cure the election of its candidate for the office of United
States Senator should be considered a "contribution" to hisor her campaign. I therefore disagree with the conclusion
reached in Part III of the principal opinion.I am persuaded that three interests provide a constitutionally sufficient predicate for federal limits on spending by po-litical parties. First, such limits serve the interest in avoiding both the appearance and the reality of a corrupt politicalprocess. A party shares a unique relationship with the candidate it sponsors because their political fates are inextrica-bly linked. That interdependency creates a special danger
that the party--or the persons who control the party--willabuse the influence it has over the candidate by virtue of its
power to spend. The provisions at issue are appropriatelyaimed at reducing that threat. The fact that the party in
this case had not yet chosen its nominee at the time it broad-cast the challenged advertisements is immaterial to the analysis. Although the Democratic and Republican nominees

Stevens, J., dissenting
for the 1996 Presidential race will not be selected until this
summer, current advertising expenditures by the two national parties are no less contributions to the campaigns of
the respective frontrunners than those that will be made in
the fall.

Second, these restrictions supplement other spending limitations embodied in the Federal Election Campaign Act of
1971, which are likewise designed to prevent corruption.
Individuals and certain organizations are permitted to contribute up to $1,000 to a candidate. 2 U. S. C. $ 441a(a)(1)(A).
Since the same donors can give up to $5,000 to party committees, $ 441a(a)(1)(C), if there were no limits on party
spending, their contributions could be spent to benefit the
candidate and thereby circumvent the $1,000 cap. We have
recognized the legitimate interest in blocking similar attempts to undermine the policies of the Act. See California
Medical Assn. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 453 U. S. 182,
197-199 (1981) (plurality opinion) (approving ceiling on contributions to political action committees to prevent circumvention of limitations on individual contributions to candidates); id., at 203 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment); Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 38
(1976) (per curiam) (approving limitation on total contributions by an individual in connection with an election on
same rationale).

Finally, I believe the Government has an important interest in leveling the electoral playing field by constraining the
cost of federal campaigns. As Justice White pointed out in
his opinion in Buckley, "money is not always equivalent to
or used for speech, even in the context of political campaigns." Id., at 263 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). It is quite wrong to assume that the net effect
of limits on contributions and expenditures--which tend to
protect equal access to the political arena, to free candidates
and their staffs from the interminable burden of fundraising,

and to diminish the importance of repetitive 30-second com-mercials--will be adverse to the interest in informed debate

protected by the First Amendment. See id., at 262-266.Congress surely has both wisdom and experience in these
matters that is far superior to ours. I would therefore ac-cord special deference to its judgment on questions related
to the extent and nature of limits on campaign spending.*Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of
Appeals.

*One irony of the case is that both the Democratic National Party and
the Republican National Party have sided with petitioners in challenging
a law that Congress has the obvious power to change. See Brief for Democratic National Committee as Amicus Curiae; Brief for Republican National Committee as Amicus Curiae.

FELKER v. TURPIN, WARDEN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 95-8836 (A-890). Argued June 3, 1996--Decided June 28, 1996
After he was convicted of murder and other crimes and sentenced to death

by a Georgia state court, petitioner was denied relief on direct appeal,
in two rounds of state collateral proceedings, and in a first round of
federal habeas corpus proceedings. While he was awaiting execution,
the President signed into law the Antiterrorism and Effective Death
Penalty Act of 1996 (Act), Title I of which, as here pertinent, requires
dismissal of a claim presented in a state prisoner's second or successive
federal habeas application if the claim was also presented in a prior
application, 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b)(1); compels dismissal of a claim that was
not presented in a prior federal application, unless certain conditions
apply, $ 2244(b)(2); creates a "gatekeeping" mechanism, whereby the
prospective applicant files in the court of appeals a motion for leave to
file a second or successive habeas application in the district court, and
a three-judge panel determines whether the application makes a prima
facie showing that it satisfies $ 2244(b)'s requirements, $ 2244(b)(3); and
declares that a panel's grant or denial of authorization to file "shall not
be appealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for . . . writ of
certiorari," $ 2244(b)(3)(E). Petitioner filed a motion for leave to file a
second federal habeas petition, which the Eleventh Circuit denied on
the grounds, inter alia, that the claims to be raised therein had not been
presented in his first petition and did not meet $ 2244(b)(2)'s conditions.
Petitioner then filed in this Court a pleading styled a "Petition for Writ
of Habeas Corpus [and] for Appellate or Certiorari Review . . . ." The
Court granted certiorari, ordering briefing on the extent to which Title
I's provisions apply to a habeas petition filed in this Court, whether
application of the Act suspended habeas in this case, and whether
Title I, especially the provision to be codified at $ 2244(b)(3)(E), unconstitutionally restricts the Court's jurisdiction.

Held:

1. The Act does not preclude this Court from entertaining an application for habeas corpus relief, although it does affect the standards
governing the granting of such relief. Pp. 658-663.

(a) Title I does not deprive this Court of jurisdiction to entertain
habeas petitions filed as original matters pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $$ 2241

518US3$86Z 06-01-99 17:20:41 PAGES OPINPGT

Syllabus
and 2254. No Title I provision mentions the Court's authority to entertain such original petitions; in contrast, $ 103 amends the Federal Rules
of Appellate Procedure to bar consideration of original habeas petitions
in the courts of appeals. Although $ 2244(b)(3)(E) precludes the Court
from reviewing, by appeal or certiorari, the latter courts' decisions exercising the "gatekeeping" function for second habeas petitions, it makes
no mention of the Court's original habeas jurisdiction. Thus, the Court
declines to find a repeal of $ 2241 by implication. See Ex parte Yerger,
8 Wall. 85, 105. This conclusion obviates any claim by petitioner under
the Constitution's Exceptions Clause, Art. III, $ 2, which provides, inter
alia, that, "[i]n all . . . Cases . . . the Supreme Court shall have appellate
Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions . . . as
the Congress shall make." Since the Act does not repeal the Court's
authority to entertain a habeas petition, there can be no plausible argument that it deprives the Court of appellate jurisdiction in violation of
that Clause. Pp. 658-662.

(b) Title I changes the standards governing this Court's consideration of habeas petitions by imposing new requirements under 28
U. S. C. $ 2254(a), which limits the Court's authority to grant relief to
state prisoners. Section 2244(b)(3)'s "gatekeeping" system does not
apply to the Court because it is limited to applications "filed in the district court." There is no such limitation, however, on the restrictions
imposed by $$ 2244(b)(1) and (2), and those restrictions inform the
Court's authority to grant relief on original habeas petitions, whether
or not the Court is bound by the restrictions. Pp. 662-663.

2. The Act does not violate the Constitution's Suspension Clause, Art.
I, $ 9, cl. 2, which provides that "[t]he Privilege of the Writ of Habeas
Corpus shall not be suspended." The new restrictions on successive
habeas petitions constitute a modified res judicata rule, a restraint on
what is called in habeas practice "abuse of the writ." The doctrine of
abuse of the writ refers to a complex and evolving body of equitable
principles informed and controlled by historical usage, statutory developments, and judicial decisions. McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 489.
The new restrictions are well within the compass of this evolutionary
process and do not amount to a "suspension" of the writ. Pp. 663-664.

3. The petition for an original writ of habeas corpus is denied. Petitioner's claims do not satisfy the $ 2244(b)(2) requirements, let alone this
Court's Rule 20.4(a), which requires that the habeas petitioner show
"exceptional circumstances" justifying the issuance of the writ and says
that habeas relief is rarely granted. Petitioner's claims here do not
materially differ from numerous other claims made by successive habeas
petitioners that the Court has had occasion to review on stay applications. Pp. 664-665.

Certiorari dismissed for want of jurisdiction; writ of habeas corpus denied.

Title I of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death PenaltyAct of 1996 (Act) works substantial changes to chapter 153
of Title 28 of the United States Code, which authorizes fed-eral courts to grant the writ of habeas corpus. Pub. L. 104-

We hold that the Act does not precludethis Court from entertaining an application for habeas corpus relief, although it does affect the standards governingthe granting of such relief.

tioner forcibly subdued her, raped her, and sodomized her.
Jane pleaded with petitioner to let her go, but he said he
could not because she would notify the police. She escaped
later, when petitioner fell asleep. Jane notified the police,
and petitioner was eventually convicted of aggravated sodomy and sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment.

Petitioner was paroled four years later. On November 23,
1981, he met Joy Ludlam, a cocktail waitress, at the lounge
where she worked. She was interested in changing jobs,
and petitioner used a series of deceptions involving offering
her a job at "The Leather Shoppe," a business he owned, to
induce her to visit him the next day. The last time Joy was
seen alive was the evening of the next day. Her dead body
was discovered two weeks later in a creek. Forensic analysis established that she had been beaten, raped, and sodomized, and that she had been strangled to death before being
left in the creek. Investigators discovered hair resembling
petitioner's on Joy's body and clothes, hair resembling Joy's
in petitioner's bedroom, and clothing fibers like those in Joy's
coat in the hatchback of petitioner's car. One of petitioner's
neighbors reported seeing Joy's car at petitioner's house the
day she disappeared.

A jury convicted petitioner of murder, rape, aggravated
sodomy, and false imprisonment. Petitioner was sentenced
to death on the murder charge. The Georgia Supreme
Court affirmed petitioner's conviction and death sentence,
Felker v. State, 252 Ga. 351, 314 S. E. 2d 621, and we denied
certiorari, 469 U. S. 873 (1984). A state trial court denied
collateral relief, the Georgia Supreme Court declined to issue
a certificate of probable cause to appeal the denial, and we
again denied certiorari. Felker v. Zant, 502 U. S. 1064
(1992).

Petitioner then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus
in the United States District Court for the Middle District
of Georgia, alleging that (1) the State's evidence was insuffi518US3$86H 06-01-99 17:20:41 PAGES OPINPGT

cient to convict him; (2) the State withheld exculpatory evi-dence, in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963);

(3) petitioner's counsel rendered ineffective assistance atsentencing; (4) the State improperly used hypnosis to refresh
a witness' memory; and (5) the State violated double jeop-ardy and collateral estoppel principles by using petitioner's
crime against Jane W. as evidence at petitioner's trial forcrimes against Joy Ludlam. The District Court denied the
petition. The United States Court of Appeals for the Elev-enth Circuit affirmed, 52 F. 3d 907, extended on denial of
petition for rehearing, 62 F. 3d 342 (1995), and we deniedcertiorari, 516 U. S. 1133 (1996).

The State scheduled petitioner's execution for the periodMay 2-9, 1996. On April 29, 1996, petitioner filed a second
petition for state collateral relief. The state trial court de-nied this petition on May 1, and the Georgia Supreme Court
denied certiorari on May 2.On April 24, 1996, the President signed the Act into law.
Title I of this Act contained a series of amendments to ex-isting federal habeas corpus law. The provisions of the
Act pertinent to this case concern second or successive ha-beas corpus applications by state prisoners. Section 106(b)
specifies the conditions under which claims in second or suc-cessive applications must be dismissed, amending 28 U. S. C.

$ 2244(b) to read:

"(1) A claim presented in a second or successive ha-beas corpus application under section 2254 that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed."(2) A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was notpresented in a prior application shall be dismissed
unless--"(A) the applicant shows that the claim relies on a

previously unavailable; or

"(B)(i) the factual predicate for the claim could nothave been discovered previously through the exercise of

due diligence; and"(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven and
viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would besufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence
that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable fact-finder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense."
Title 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. II) createsa "gatekeeping" mechanism for the consideration of second

or successive applications in district court. The prospec-tive applicant must file in the court of appeals a motion for
leave to file a second or successive habeas application inthe district court. $ 2244(b)(3)(A). A three-judge panel has
30 days to determine whether "the application makes aprima facie showing that the application satisfies the requirements of " $ 2244(b). $ 2244(b)(3)(C); see $$ 2244(b)(3)(B), (D).Section 2244(b)(3)(E) specifies that "[t]he grant or denial
of an authorization by a court of appeals to file a second orsuccessive application shall not be appealable and shall not
be the subject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ ofcertiorari."

On May 2, 1996, petitioner filed in the United States Courtof Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit a motion for stay of execution and a motion for leave to file a second or successivefederal habeas corpus petition under $ 2254. Petitioner
sought to raise two claims in his second petition, the firstbeing that the state trial court violated due process by
equating guilt "beyond a reasonable doubt" with "moral cer-tainty" of guilt in

voir dire and jury instructions. See Cagev. Louisiana, 498 U. S. 39 (1990) (per curiam). He also

alleged that qualified experts, reviewing the forensic evi-dence after his conviction, had established that Joy must
have died during a period when petitioner was under policesurveillance for Joy's disappearance and thus had a valid

alibi. He claimed that the testimony of the State's forensic
expert at trial was suspect because he is not a licensed physician, and that the new expert testimony so discredited
the State's testimony at trial that petitioner had a colorable
claim of factual innocence.

The Court of Appeals denied both motions the day they
were filed, concluding that petitioner's claims had not been
presented in his first habeas petition, that they did not meet
the standards of $ 2244(b)(2), and that they would not have
satisfied pre-Act standards for obtaining review on the merits of second or successive claims. 83 F. 3d 1303 (CA11
1996). Petitioner filed in this Court a pleading styled a "Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, for Appellate or Certiorari
Review of the Decision of the United States Circuit Court
for the Eleventh Circuit, and for Stay of Execution." On
May 3, we granted petitioner's stay application and petition
for certiorari. We ordered briefing on the extent to which
the provisions of Title I of the Act apply to a petition for
habeas corpus filed in this Court, whether application of the
Act suspended the writ of habeas corpus in this case, and
whether Title I of the Act, especially the provision to be
codified at $ 2244(b)(3)(E), constitutes an unconstitutional restriction on the jurisdiction of this Court. 517 U. S. 1182
(1996).

II

We first consider to what extent the provisions of Title I of
the Act apply to petitions for habeas corpus filed as original
matters in this Court pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $$ 2241 and
2254. We conclude that although the Act does impose new
conditions on our authority to grant relief, it does not deprive this Court of jurisdiction to entertain original habeas
petitions.

beas petition by appeal or by writ of certiorari. More than
a century ago, we considered whether a statute barring
review by appeal of the judgment of a circuit court in a
habeas case also deprived this Court of power to entertain
an original habeas petition. Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85
(1869). We consider the same question here with respect
to $ 2244(b)(3)(E).

Yerger's holding is best understood in the light of the availability of habeas corpus review at that time. Section 14 of
the Judiciary Act of 1789 authorized all federal courts, including this Court, to grant the writ of habeas corpus when
prisoners were "in custody, under or by colour of the authority of the United States, or [were] committed for trial before
some court of the same." Act of Sept. 24, 1789, ch. 20, $ 14,
1 Stat. 82.1 Congress greatly expanded the scope of federal
habeas corpus in 1867, authorizing federal courts to grant
the writ, "in addition to the authority already conferred by
law," "in all cases where any person may be restrained of his
or her liberty in violation of the constitution, or of any treaty
or law of the United States." Act of Feb. 5, 1867, ch. 28, 14
Stat. 385.2 Before the Act of 1867, the only instances in
which a federal court could issue the writ to produce a state
prisoner were if the prisoner was "necessary to be brought
into court to testify," Act of Sept. 24, 1789, ch. 20, $ 14, 1 Stat.
82, was "committed . . . for any act done . . . in pursuance of

which now states in pertinent part: "Writs of habeas corpus may be
granted by the Supreme Court, any justice thereof, the district courts and
any circuit judge within their respective jurisdictions."

2 This language from the 1867 Act is the direct ancestor of $ 2241(c)(3),

which states: "The writ of habeas corpus shall not extend to a prisoner
unless . . . [h]e is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or
treaties of the United States."

Opinion of the Court
State, and domiciled therein," and held under state law, Act
of Aug. 29, 1842, ch. 257, 5 Stat. 539-540.

The Act of 1867 also expanded our statutory appellate jurisdiction to authorize appeals to this Court from the final
decision of any circuit court on a habeas petition. 14 Stat.
386. This enactment changed the result of Barry v. Mercein, 5 How. 103 (1847), in which we had held that the Judiciary Act of 1789 did not authorize this Court to conduct
appellate review of circuit court habeas decisions. However,
in 1868, Congress revoked the appellate jurisdiction it had
given in 1867, repealing "so much of the [Act of 1867] as
authorizes an appeal from the judgment of the circuit court
to the Supreme Court of the United States." Act of Mar.
27, 1868, ch. 34, $ 2, 15 Stat. 44.

In Yerger, we considered whether the Act of 1868 deprived
us not only of power to hear an appeal from an inferior
court's decision on a habeas petition, but also of power to
entertain a habeas petition to this Court under $ 14 of the
Act of 1789. We concluded that the 1868 Act did not affect
our power to entertain such habeas petitions. We explained
that the 1868 Act's text addressed only jurisdiction over appeals conferred under the Act of 1867, not habeas jurisdiction
conferred under the Acts of 1789 and 1867. We rejected the
suggestion that the Act of 1867 had repealed our habeas
power by implication. Yerger, 8 Wall., at 105. Repeals by
implication are not favored, we said, and the continued exercise of original habeas jurisdiction was not "repugnant" to a
prohibition on review by appeal of circuit court habeas judgments. Ibid.

Turning to the present case, we conclude that Title I of
the Act has not repealed our authority to entertain original
habeas petitions, for reasons similar to those stated in
Yerger. No provision of Title I mentions our authority to
entertain original habeas petitions; in contrast, $ 103 amends
the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure to bar consider518US3$86H 06-01-99 17:20:41 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
ation of original habeas petitions in the courts of appeals.3Although $ 2244(b)(3)(E) precludes us from reviewing, by

appeal or petition for certiorari, a judgment on an applica-tion for leave to file a second habeas petition in district court,
it makes no mention of our authority to hear habeas petitionsfiled as original matters in this Court. As we declined to
find a repeal of $ 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 as applied tothis Court by implication then, we decline to find a similar
repeal of $ 2241 of Title 28--its descendant, n. 1, supra--byimplication now.

This conclusion obviates one of the constitutional chal-lenges raised. The critical language of Article III, $ 2, of
the Constitution provides that, apart from several classesof cases specifically enumerated in this Court's original
jurisdiction, "[i]n all the other Cases . . . the supreme Courtshall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact,
with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as theCongress shall make." Previous decisions construing this
clause have said that while our appellate powers "are givenby the constitution," "they are limited and regulated by the
[Judiciary Act of 1789], and by such other acts as have beenpassed on the subject."

Durousseau v. United States, 6Cranch 307, 314 (1810); see also United States v. More, 3

Cranch 159, 172-173 (1805). The Act does remove our au-thority to entertain an appeal or a petition for a writ of certiorari to review a decision of a court of appeals exercisingits "gatekeeping" function over a second petition. But since
it does not repeal our authority to entertain a petition for

the appropriate district court. If application is made to a circuit judge,
the application shall be transferred to the appropriate district court. If
an application is made to or transferred to the district court and denied,
renewal of the application before a circuit judge shall not be permitted.
The applicant may, pursuant to section 2253 of title 28, United States Code,
appeal to the appropriate court of appeals from the order of the district

Opinion of the Court
habeas corpus, there can be no plausible argument that theAct has deprived this Court of appellate jurisdiction in violation of Article III, $ 2. B

We consider next how Title I affects the requirements astate prisoner must satisfy to show he is entitled to a writ
of habeas corpus from this Court. Title I of the Act haschanged the standards governing our consideration of habeas
petitions by imposing new requirements for the granting ofrelief to state prisoners. Our authority to grant habeas relief to state prisoners is limited by $ 2254, which specifies theconditions under which such relief may be granted to "a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court." 4$ 2254(a). Several sections of the Act impose new requirements for the granting of relief under this section, and theytherefore inform our authority to grant such relief as well.

Section 2244(b) addresses second or successive habeas pe-titions. Section 2244(b)(3)'s "gatekeeping" system for second petitions does not apply to our consideration of habeaspetitions because it applies to applications "filed in the district court." $ 2244(b)(3)(A). There is no such limitation,however, on the restrictions on repetitive and new claims
imposed by $$ 2244(b)(1) and (2). These restrictions applywithout qualification to any "second or successive habeas
corpus application under section 2254." $$ 2244(b)(1), (2).

4 As originally enacted in 1948, 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 specified that "[a]n
application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody
pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted unless
it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in
the courts of the State." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 (1946 ed., Supp. III). The
reviser's notes, citing Ex parte Hawk, 321 U. S. 114 (1944) (per curiam),
indicated that "[t]his new section is declaratory of existing law as affirmed
by the Supreme Court." Reviser's Note following 28 U. S. C. $ 2254,
p. 1109 (1946 ed., Supp. III). Hawk was one of a series of opinions in
which we applied the exhaustion requirement first announced in Ex parte
Royall, 117 U. S. 241 (1886), to deny relief to applicants seeking writs of
habeas corpus from this Court.

663Cite as: 518 U. S. 651 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
Whether or not we are bound by these restrictions, they cer-tainly inform our consideration of original habeas petitions.

III
Next, we consider whether the Act suspends the writ ofhabeas corpus in violation of Article I, $ 9, clause 2, of the

Constitution. This Clause provides that "[t]he Privilege ofthe Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless
when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety mayrequire it."

The writ of habeas corpus known to the Framers was quitedifferent from that which exists today. As we explained
previously, the first Congress made the writ of habeas corpusavailable only to prisoners confined under the authority of
the United States, not under state authority. Supra, at 659-660; see

Ex parte Dorr, 3 How. 103 (1844). The class of judi-cial actions reviewable by the writ was more restricted as

well. In Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193 (1830), we denied apetition for a writ of habeas corpus from a prisoner "detained
in prison by virtue of the judgment of a court, which courtpossesses general and final jurisdiction in criminal cases."
Id., at 202. Reviewing the English common law which in-formed American courts' understanding of the scope of the
writ, we held that "[t]he judgment of the circuit court in acriminal case is of itself evidence of its own legality," and
that we could not "usurp that power by the instrumentalityof the writ of habeas corpus." Id., at 207.

It was not until 1867 that Congress made the writ gener-ally available in "all cases where any person may be restrained of his or her liberty in violation of the constitution,or of any treaty or law of the United States."

Supra, at 659.And it was not until well into this century that this Court

interpreted that provision to allow a final judgment of con-viction in a state court to be collaterally attacked on habeas.
See, e. g., Waley v. Johnston, 316 U. S. 101 (1942) (per cu-riam); Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443 (1953). But we assume,

518US3$86H 06-01-99 17:20:41 PAGES OPINPGT
664 FELKER v. TURPIN

Opinion of the Court
for purposes of decision here, that the Suspension Clause of
the Constitution refers to the writ as it exists today, rather
than as it existed in 1789. See Swain v. Pressley, 430 U. S.
372 (1977); id., at 384 (Burger, C. J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment).

The Act requires a habeas petitioner to obtain leave from
the court of appeals before filing a second habeas petition in
the district court. But this requirement simply transfers
from the district court to the court of appeals a screening
function which would previously have been performed by the
district court as required by 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 Rule 9(b).
The Act also codifies some of the pre-existing limits on successive petitions, and further restricts the availability of relief to habeas petitioners. But we have long recognized that
"the power to award the writ by any of the courts of the
United States, must be given by written law," Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, 94 (1807), and we have likewise recognized
that judgments about the proper scope of the writ are "normally for Congress to make." Lonchar v. Thomas, 517 U. S.
314, 323 (1996).

The new restrictions on successive petitions constitute a
modified res judicata rule, a restraint on what is called in
habeas corpus practice "abuse of the writ." In McCleskey
v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991), we said that "the doctrine of
abuse of the writ refers to a complex and evolving body of
equitable principles informed and controlled by historical
usage, statutory developments, and judicial decisions." Id.,
at 489. The added restrictions which the Act places on second habeas petitions are well within the compass of this evolutionary process, and we hold that they do not amount to a
"suspension" of the writ contrary to Article I, $ 9.

IV
We have answered the questions presented by the petition
for certiorari in this case, and we now dispose of the petition

665Cite as: 518 U. S. 651 (1996)
Stevens, J., concurring
for an original writ of habeas corpus. Our Rule 20.4(a)delineates the standards under which we grant such writs:

"A petition seeking the issuance of a writ of habeascorpus shall comply with the requirements of 28 U. S. C.

$$ 2241 and 2242, and in particular with the provision inthe last paragraph of $ 2242 requiring a statement of the
`reasons for not making application to the district courtof the district in which the applicant is held.' If the
relief sought is from the judgment of a state court, thepetition shall set forth specifically how and wherein the
petitioner has exhausted available remedies in the statecourts or otherwise comes within the provisions of 28
U. S. C. $ 2254(b). To justify the granting of a writ ofhabeas corpus, the petitioner must show exceptional
circumstances warranting the exercise of the Court'sdiscretionary powers and must show that adequate
relief cannot be obtained in any other form or from anyother court. These writs are rarely granted."

Reviewing petitioner's claims here, they do not materiallydiffer from numerous other claims made by successive habeas petitioners which we have had occasion to review onstay applications to this Court. Neither of them satisfies
the requirements of the relevant provisions of the Act, letalone the requirement that there be "exceptional circumstances" justifying the issuance of the writ.

* * *The petition for writ of certiorari is dismissed for want of

jurisdiction. The petition for an original writ of habeascorpus is denied.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter and
Justice Breyer join, concurring.

While I join the Court's opinion, I believe its response tothe argument that the Act has deprived this Court of appel518US3$86I 06-01-99 17:20:41 PAGES OPINPGT

Souter, J., concurring
late jurisdiction in violation of Article III, $ 2, is incomplete.I therefore add this brief comment.

As the Court correctly concludes, the Act does not divestthis Court of jurisdiction to grant petitioner relief by issuing
a writ of habeas corpus. It does, however, except the cate-gory of orders entered by the courts of appeals pursuant to
28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. II) from this Court'sstatutory jurisdiction to review cases in the courts of appeals
pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1254(1). The Act does not purportto limit our jurisdiction under that section to review interlocutory orders in such cases, to limit our jurisdiction under$ 1254(2), or to limit our jurisdiction under the All Writs Act,
28 U. S. C. $ 1651.Accordingly, there are at least three reasons for rejecting
petitioner's argument that the limited exception violates Ar-ticle III, $ 2. First, if we retain jurisdiction to review the
gatekeeping orders pursuant to the All Writs Act--and peti-tioner has not suggested otherwise--such orders are not immune from direct review. Second, by entering an appro-priate interlocutory order, a court of appeals may provide
this Court with an opportunity to review its proposed dispo-sition of a motion for leave to file a second or successive
habeas application. Third, in the exercise of our habeas cor-pus jurisdiction, we may consider earlier gatekeeping orders
entered by the court of appeals to inform our judgments andprovide the parties with the functional equivalent of direct
review. In this case the Court correctly denies the writ ofhabeas corpus because petitioner's claims do not satisfy the
requirements of our pre-Act jurisprudence or the require-ments of the Act, including the standards governing the
court of appeals' gatekeeping function.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice Breyer join, concurring.

I join the Court's opinion. The Court holds today that theAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.

L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1217, precludes our review, by "certio518US3$86M 06-01-99 17:20:41 PAGES OPINPGT

rari" or by "appeal," over the courts of appeals's "gate-keeper" determinations. See 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b)(3)(E)

(1994 ed., Supp. II). The statute's text does not necessarilyforeclose all of our appellate jurisdiction, see, e. g., 28 U. S. C.

$ 1254(2) (certified questions from courts of appeals);$ 1651(a) (authority to issue appropriate writs in aid of another exercise of appellate jurisdiction); this Court's Rule20.3 (procedure for petitions for extraordinary writs), nor has
Congress repealed our authority to entertain original peti-tions for writs of habeas corpus.

1 Because petitioner sought

only a writ of certiorari (which Congress has foreclosed) anda writ of habeas corpus (which, even applying the traditional

criteria, we would choose to deny, see ante, at 664-665), Ihave no difficulty with the conclusion that the statute is not
on its face, or as applied here, unconstitutional. I write onlyto add that if it should later turn out that statutory avenues
other than certiorari for reviewing a gatekeeping determina-tion were closed, the question whether the statute exceeded
Congress's Exceptions Clause power would be open.2 Thequestion could arise if the courts of appeals adopted divergent interpretations of the gatekeeper standard.

1 Such a petition is commonly understood to be "original" in the sense
of being filed in the first instance in this Court, but nonetheless for constitutional purposes an exercise of this Court's appellate (rather than original) jurisdiction. See Oaks, The "Original" Writ of Habeas Corpus in the
Supreme Court, 1962 S. Ct. Rev. 153.

BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS,WABAUNSEE COUNTY, KANSAS

v. UMBEHR
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 94-1654. Argued November 28, 1995--Decided June 28, 1996
During the term of his at-will contract with Wabaunsee County, Kansas

(County), to haul trash, respondent Umbehr was an outspoken critic of
petitioner Board of County Commissioners (Board). After the commissioners voted to terminate (or prevent the automatic renewal of) the
contract, allegedly because they took Umbehr's criticism badly, he
brought this suit against two of them under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. The
District Court granted them summary judgment, but the Tenth Circuit
reversed in relevant part and remanded, holding that the First Amendment protects independent contractors from governmental retaliation
against their speech, and that the extent of that protection must be
determined by weighing the government's interests as contractor
against the free speech interests at stake in accordance with the balancing test applied in the government employment context under Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391
U. S. 563, 568.

Held: The First Amendment protects independent contractors from the

termination or prevention of automatic renewal of at-will government
contracts in retaliation for their exercise of the freedom of speech, and
the Pickering balancing test, adjusted to weigh the government's interests as contractor rather than as employer, determines the extent of
that protection. Pp. 673-686.

(a) Because of the obvious similarities between government employees and government contractors with respect to this issue, the
Court is guided by its government employment precedents. Among
other things, those precedents have recognized that government workers are constitutionally protected from dismissal for publicly or privately criticizing their employer's policies, see, e. g., Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593, but have also acknowledged that the First
Amendment does not guarantee absolute freedom of speech, see, e. g.,
Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138, 146, and have required a fact-sensitive
and deferential weighing of the government employer's legitimate interests against its employees' First Amendment rights, see, e. g., Pickering, supra, at 568. The parties' attempts to differentiate between inde518us3$87Z 05-20-99 19:19:23 PAGES OPINPGT

669Cite as: 518 U. S. 668 (1996)
Syllabus
pendent contractors and government employees are unavailing. Each
of their arguments for and against the imposition of liability has some
force, but all of them can be accommodated by applying the existing
government employee framework. Moreover, application of the nuanced Pickering approach is superior to a bright-line rule giving the
government carte blanche to terminate independent contractors for exercising their speech rights. Although both the individual's and the
government's interests are typically--though not always--somewhat
less strong in an independent contractor case, the fact that such contractors are similar in most relevant respects to government employees
compels the conclusion that the same form of balancing analysis should
apply to each. Pp. 673-681.

(b) Neither the dissent's fears of excessive litigation, nor its assertion
that the allocation of government contracts on the basis of political bias
is a longstanding tradition, can deprive independent contractors of
protection. Its own description of "lowest-responsible-bidder" requirements in a wide range of government contracting laws voluntarily
adopted by federal and state authorities suggests that government
contracting norms incompatible with political bias have proliferated
without unduly burdening the government, and such laws have a long
history. Pp. 681-685.

(c) Because the courts below assumed that Umbehr's termination (or
nonrenewal) was in retaliation for his protected speech activities, and
did not pass on the balance between the government's interests and his
free speech interests, the conclusion that independent contractors do
enjoy some First Amendment protection requires affirmance of the
Tenth Circuit's decision to remand the case. To prevail, Umbehr must
show initially that the termination of his contract was motivated by his
speech on a matter of public concern, see Connick, supra, at 146; he
must therefore prove more than the mere fact that he criticized the
Board members before he was terminated. If he can do so, the Board
will have a valid defense if it can show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that, in light of their knowledge, perceptions, and policies at the
time of the termination, the Board members would have terminated the
contract regardless of his speech. See Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v.
Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 287. The Board will also prevail if it can demonstrate that the County's legitimate interests as contractor, deferentially
viewed, outweigh the free speech interests at stake. See, e. g., Pickering, supra, at 568. And, if Umbehr prevails, evidence that the Board
members discovered facts after termination that would have led to a
later termination anyway, and evidence of mitigation of his loss by
means of subsequent trash hauling contracts with cities in the County,
would be relevant in assessing the appropriate remedy. Because

him to be the exclusive hauler of trash for cities in theCounty at a rate specified in the contract. Each city was
free to reject or, on 90 days' notice, to opt out of, the contract. By its terms, the contract between Umbehr and theCounty was automatically renewed annually unless either

party terminated it by giving notice at least 60 days beforethe end of the year or a renegotiation was instituted on 90
days' notice. Pursuant to the contract, Umbehr hauledtrash for six of the County's seven cities from 1985 to 1991
on an exclusive and uninterrupted basis.

During the term of his contract, Umbehr was an outspoken
critic of petitioner, the Board of County Commissioners of
Wabaunsee County (Board), the three-member governing
body of the County. Umbehr spoke at the Board's meetings,
and wrote critical letters and editorials in local newspapers
regarding the County's landfill user rates, the cost of obtaining official documents from the County, alleged violations by
the Board of the Kansas Open Meetings Act, the County's
alleged mismanagement of taxpayers' money, and other topics. His allegations of violation of the Kansas Open Meetings Act were vindicated in a consent decree signed by the
Board's members. Umbehr also ran unsuccessfully for election to the Board.

The Board's members allegedly took Umbehr's criticism
badly, threatening the official county newspaper with censorship for publishing his writings. In 1990, they voted, 2 to 1,
to terminate (or prevent the automatic renewal of ) Umbehr's
contract with the County. That attempt at termination
failed because of a technical defect, but in 1991, the Board
succeeded in terminating Umbehr's contract, again by a 2 to
1 vote. Umbehr subsequently negotiated new contracts
with five of the six cities that he had previously served.

In 1992, Umbehr brought this suit against the two majority Board members in their individual and official capacities

Opinion of the Court
under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, alleging that they had terminated his government contract in retaliation for his criticism of the County and the Board. The
Board members moved for summary judgment. The District Court assumed that Umbehr's contract was terminated
in retaliation for his speech, and that he suffered consequential damages. But it held that "the First Amendment does
not prohibit [the Board] from considering [Umbehr's] expression as a factor in deciding not to continue with the trash
hauling contract at the end of the contract's annual term,"
because, as an independent contractor, Umbehr was not entitled to the First Amendment protection afforded to public
employees. Umbehr v. McClure, 840 F. Supp. 837, 839 (Kan.
1993). It also held that the claims against the Board members in their individual capacities would be barred by qualified immunity, id., at 841, a ruling which was affirmed on
appeal and which is not at issue here.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit
reversed (except as to qualified immunity), holding that "an
independent contractor is protected under the First Amendment from retaliatory governmental action, just as an employee would be," and that the extent of protection is to
be determined by weighing the government's interests as
contractor against the free speech interests at stake in accordance with the balancing test that we used to determine
government employees' First Amendment rights in Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will
Cty., 391 U. S. 563, 568 (1968). 44 F. 3d 876, 883 (CA10 1995).
It therefore remanded the official capacity claims to the District Court for further proceedings, including consideration
of whether the termination was in fact retaliatory. The
Board members who were the original defendants in this suit
subsequently resigned their positions on the Board, so in this
Court, the Board was substituted for them as petitioner.
See this Court's Rule 35.3.

We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict between theCourts of Appeals regarding whether, and to what extent,

Circuit. See Blackburn v. Marshall, 42 F. 3d 925, 931-935(CA5 1995);

but see Sweeney v. Bond, 669 F. 2d 542 (CA8), cert. denied,459 U. S. 878 (1982). See also Abercrombie v. Catoosa, 896
F. 2d 1228, 1233 (CA10 1990) (allowing an independent con-tractor to sue for termination based on his speech and political activities). The Third and Seventh Circuits have, how-ever, held that an independent contractor who does not have
a property interest in his contract with the government hasno right not to have that contract terminated in retaliation
for his exercise of First Amendment freedoms of politicalaffiliation and participation. See

Horn v. Kean, 796 F. 2d668 (CA3 1986) (en banc);
O'Hare Truck Service, Inc. v.Northlake, 47 F. 3d 883 (CA7 1995), reversed, post, p. 712;

Downtown Auto Parks, Inc. v. Milwaukee, 938 F. 2d 705(CA7), cert. denied, 502 U. S. 1005 (1991); Triad Assocs., Inc.
v. Chicago Housing Authority, 892 F. 2d 583 (CA7 1989),cert. denied, 498 U. S. 845 (1990).

We agree with the Tenth Circuit that independent contrac-tors are protected, and that the

Pickering balancing test,adjusted to weigh the government's interests as contractor

rather than as employer, determines the extent of their pro-tection. We therefore affirm.

Opinion of the Court
federal, state, or local governments to terminate their rela-tionships with independent contractors because of the contractors' speech. We have, however, considered the sameissue in the context of government

employees' rights on
several occasions. The similarities between government
employees and government contractors with respect to thisissue are obvious. The government needs to be free to terminate both employees and contractors for poor perform-ance, to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and responsiveness
of service to the public, and to prevent the appearance ofcorruption. And, absent contractual, statutory, or constitutional restriction, the government is entitled to terminate
them for no reason at all. But either type of relationship
provides a valuable financial benefit, the threat of the loss of
which in retaliation for speech may chill speech on matters
of public concern by those who, because of their dealings
with the government, "are often in the best position to know
what ails the agencies for which they work," Waters v.
Churchill, 511 U. S. 661, 674 (1994) (plurality opinion). Because of these similarities, we turn initially to our government employment precedents for guidance.

Those precedents have long since rejected Justice Holmes'
famous dictum, that a policeman "may have a constitutional
right to talk politics, but he has no constitutional right to be
a policeman," McAuliffe v. Mayor of New Bedford, 155 Mass.
216, 220, 29 N. E. 517 (1892). Recognizing that "constitutional violations may arise from the deterrent, or `chilling,'
effect of governmental [efforts] that fall short of a direct prohibition against the exercise of First Amendment rights,"
Laird v. Tatum, 408 U. S. 1, 11 (1972), our modern "unconstitutional conditions" doctrine holds that the government
"may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes
his constitutionally protected . . . freedom of speech" even if
he has no entitlement to that benefit, Perry v. Sindermann,
408 U. S. 593, 597 (1972). We have held that government
workers are constitutionally protected from dismissal for re518us3$87J 05-20-99 19:19:23 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
fusing to take an oath regarding their political affiliation, see,
e. g., Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U. S. 183 (1952); Keyishian
v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589(1967), for publicly or privately criticizing their employer's

policies, see Perry, supra; Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v.
Doyle, 429 U. S. 274 (1977); Givhan v. Western Line Consol.
School Dist., 439 U. S. 410 (1979), for expressing hostility to
prominent political figures, see Rankin v. McPherson, 483U. S. 378 (1987), or, except where political affiliation may reasonably be considered an appropriate job qualification, forsupporting or affiliating with a particular political party, see,
e. g., Branti v. Finkel, 445 U. S. 507 (1980). See also United
States v. Treasury Employees, 513 U. S. 454 (1995) (Government employees are protected from undue burdens on
their expressive activities created by a prohibition against
accepting honoraria); Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S.
209, 234 (1977) (government employment cannot be conditioned on making or not making financial contributions to
particular political causes).

While protecting First Amendment freedoms, we have,
however, acknowledged that the First Amendment does not
create property or tenure rights, and does not guarantee
absolute freedom of speech. The First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech protects government employees
from termination because of their speech on matters of
public concern. See Connick v. Myers, 461 U. S. 138, 146
(1983) (speech on merely private employment matters is
unprotected). To prevail, an employee must prove that the
conduct at issue was constitutionally protected, and that it
was a substantial or motivating factor in the termination.
If the employee discharges that burden, the government can
escape liability by showing that it would have taken the
same action even in the absence of the protected conduct.
See Mt. Healthy, supra, at 287. And even termination because of protected speech may be justified when legitimate
countervailing government interests are sufficiently strong.

676 BOARD OF COMM'RS, WABAUNSEE CTY. v. UMBEHR

Opinion of the Court
Government employees' First Amendment rights depend on
the "balance between the interests of the [employee], as a
citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and
the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the
efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees." Pickering, 391 U. S., at 568. In striking that balance, we have concluded that "[t]he government's interest in
achieving its goals as effectively and efficiently as possible is
elevated from a relatively subordinate interest when it acts
as sovereign to a significant one when it acts as employer."
Waters, 511 U. S., at 675 (plurality opinion). We have, therefore, "consistently given greater deference to government
predictions of harm used to justify restriction of employee
speech than to predictions of harm used to justify restrictions on the speech of the public at large." Id., at 673; accord, Treasury Employees, supra, at 475.

The parties each invite us to differentiate between independent contractors and employees. The Board urges us
not to "extend" the First Amendment rights of government
employees to contractors. Umbehr, joined by the Solicitor General as amicus curiae, contends that, on proof of

viewpoint-based retaliation for contractors' political speech,
the government should be required to justify its actions as
narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.

Both parties observe that independent contractors in general, and Umbehr in particular, work at a greater remove
from government officials than do most government employees. In the Board's view, the key feature of an independent
contractor's contract is that it does not give the government
the right to supervise and control the details of how work is
done. The Board argues that the lack of day-to-day control
accentuates the government's need to have the work done by
someone it trusts, cf. Branti, supra, at 518 (certain positions
in government employment implicate such a need for trust
that their award on the basis of party political affiliation is

Opinion of the Court
justified), and to resort to the sanction of termination forunsatisfactory performance.* Umbehr, on the other hand,

argues that the government interests in maintaining harmo-nious working environments and relationships recognized in
our government employee cases are attenuated where thecontractor does not work at the government's workplace
and does not interact daily with government officers and em-ployees. He also points out that to the extent that he is
publicly perceived as an independent contractor, any govern-ment concern that his political statements will be confused
with the government's political positions is mitigated. TheBoard and the dissent,

post, at 697-699, retort that the costof fending off litigation, and the potential for government

contracting practices to ossify into prophylactic rules toavoid potential litigation and liability, outweigh the interests
of independent contractors, who are typically less financiallydependent on their government contracts than are government employees.Each of these arguments for and against the imposition of
liability has some force. But all of them can be accommo-dated by applying our existing framework for government
employee cases to independent contractors. Mt. Healthy as-sures the government's ability to terminate contracts so long
as it does not do so in retaliation for protected First Amend-ment activity. Pickering requires a fact-sensitive and deferential weighing of the government's legitimate interests.

*The Board also asserts that state and local government decisions on
individual contracts are insulated by the Tenth Amendment or legislative
immunity from constitutional scrutiny and liability. See Brief for Petitioner 23-26, 37. The Tenth Amendment claim was not raised in its petition, so we do not address it. See this Court's Rule 14.1(a). Because only
claims against the Board members in their official capacities are before us,
and because immunity from suit under $ 1983 extends to public servants
only in their individual capacities, see, e. g., Leatherman v. Tarrant
County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U. S. 163, 166
(1993), the legislative immunity claim is moot.

678 BOARD OF COMM'RS, WABAUNSEE CTY. v. UMBEHR

Opinion of the Court
The dangers of burdensome litigation and the de facto impo-sition of rigid contracting rules necessitate attentive application of the Mt. Healthy requirement of proof of causation andsubstantial deference, as mandated by

Pickering, Connick,
and Waters, to the government's reasonable view of its legitimate interests, but not a per se denial of liability. Nor canthe Board's and the dissent's generalization that independent

contractors may be less dependent on the government thangovernment employees, see

post, at 696, justify denial of all
First Amendment protection to contractors. The tests thatwe have established in our government employment cases

must be judicially administered with sensitivity to governmental needs, but First Amendment rights must not be
neglected.

Umbehr's claim that speech threatens the government's
interests as contractor less than its interests as employer
will also inform the application of the Pickering test. Umbehr is correct that if the Board had exercised sovereign
power against him as a citizen in response to his political
speech, it would be required to demonstrate that its action
was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental
interest. But in this case, as in government employment
cases, the Board exercised contractual power, and its interests as a public service provider, including its interest in
being free from intensive judicial supervision of its daily
management functions, are potentially implicated. Deference is therefore due to the government's reasonable assessments of its interests as contractor.

We therefore see no reason to believe that proper application of the Pickering balancing test cannot accommodate the
differences between employees and independent contractors.
There is ample reason to believe that such a nuanced
approach, which recognizes the variety of interests that may
arise in independent contractor cases, is superior to a
bright-line rule distinguishing independent contractors from
employees. The bright-line rule proposed by the Board and

679Cite as: 518 U. S. 668 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
the dissent would give the government carte blanche to ter-minate independent contractors for exercising First Amendment rights. And that bright-line rule would leave FirstAmendment rights unduly dependent on whether state law
labels a government service provider's contract as a contract
of employment or a contract for services, a distinction whichis at best a very poor proxy for the interests at stake. See

Comment, Political Patronage in Public Contracting, 51U. Chi. L. Rev. 518, 520 (1984) ("[N]o legally relevant distinction exists between employees and contractors in termseither of the government's interest in using patronage or of
the employee or contractor's interest in free speech"); cf.
Perry, 408 U. S., at 597 (the prohibition of unconstitutional
conditions on speech applies "regardless of the public employee's contractual or other claim to a job"). Determining
constitutional claims on the basis of such formal distinctions,
which can be manipulated largely at the will of the government agencies concerned, see Logue v. United States, 412
U. S. 521, 532 (1973) (noting that independent contractors are
often employed to perform "tasks that would . . . otherwise
be performed by salaried Government employees"), is an
enterprise that we have consistently eschewed. See, e. g.,
Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U. S. 70, 83 (1973) (in the context of
the privilege against self-incrimination, "[w]e fail to see a
difference of constitutional magnitude between the threat of
job loss to an employee of the State, and a threat of loss of
contracts to a contractor"); cf. Colorado Republican Federal
Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm'n, ante, at 622
(opinion of Breyer, J.) ("[T]he government `cannot foreclose
the exercise of [First Amendment] rights by mere labels' ")
(quoting NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 429 (1963)); Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478, 486 (1964) (declining to "exalt
form over substance" in determining the temporal scope of
Sixth Amendment protections); Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S.
22, 53 (1932) ("[R]egard must be had, . . . in . . . cases where
constitutional limits are invoked, not to mere matters of form

but to the substance of what is required"); Chicago, B. & Q.
R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226, 235 (1897) ("In determining
what is due process of law regard must be had to substance,
not to form"); Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v.
Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 299 (1989) (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("[T]he applicability of a provision of the Constitution has never depended on
the vagaries of state or federal law").

Furthermore, the arguments made by both parties demonstrate that it is far from clear, as a general matter, whether
the balance of interests at stake is more favorable to
the government in independent contractor cases than in
employee cases. Our unconstitutional conditions precedents
span a spectrum from government employees, whose close
relationship with the government requires a balancing of important free speech and government interests, to claimants
for tax exemptions, Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513 (1958),
users of public facilities, e. g., Lamb's Chapel v. Center
Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384, 390-394
(1993); Healy v. James, 408 U. S. 169 (1972), and recipients of
small government subsidies, e. g., FCC v. League of Women
Voters of Cal., 468 U. S. 364 (1984), who are much less dependent on the government but more like ordinary citizens
whose viewpoints on matters of public concern the government has no legitimate interest in repressing. The First
Amendment permits neither the firing of janitors nor the
discriminatory pricing of state lottery tickets based on the
government's disagreement with certain political expression.
Independent contractors appear to us to lie somewhere between the case of government employees, who have the closest relationship with the government, and our other unconstitutional conditions precedents, which involve persons with
less close relationships with the government. The Board's
and the dissent's assertion, post, at 687, 696-697, that the
decision below represents an unwarranted "extension" of

681Cite as: 518 U. S. 668 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
special protections afforded to government employees is,
therefore, not persuasive.

B

1

The dissent's fears of excessive litigation, see post, at 697-
699, cannot justify a special exception to our unconstitutional
conditions precedent to deprive independent government
contractors of protection. Nor can its assertion that the allocation of government contracts on the basis of political bias
is a "long and unbroken tradition of our people." Post, at
688. We do not believe that tradition legitimizes patronage
contracting, regardless of whether one approaches the role
of tradition in First Amendment adjudication from the perspective of Part I of the Rutan dissent, see post, at 687 (quoting Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497 U. S. 62, 95 (1990)
(Scalia, J., dissenting)) (a practice that " `bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use that dates back to the beginning of the Republic' "
is presumed constitutional) (emphasis added), or from that of
Justice Holmes, compare post, at 690 (quoting Holmes' discussion of traditional usage of legal terminology in a tax case)
with Abrams v. United States, 250 U. S. 616, 630 (1919)
(Holmes, J., dissenting) (rejecting both the self-interested
"logi[c]" and the long history of the suppression of free
speech, including the Sedition Act of 1798 and "the common
law as to seditious libel," in favor of the true "theory of our
Constitution," which values free speech as essential to, not
subject to the vicissitudes of, our political system).

The examples to which the dissent cites, post, at 688-690,
are not, in our view, " `the stuff out of which the Court's
principles are to be formed,' " post, at 687 (quoting Rutan,
supra, at 96 (Scalia, J., dissenting)). Consider, for example,
the practice of "courtroom patronage," whereby "[e]lected

Politics 365, 367, 371 (1972) (similar), or the award of "gift[s]"to political supporters under the guise of research grants,

Tolchin, supra, at 61, or the allocation of contracts based on"contributions resulting from the compound of bribery and
extortion" and "kickbacks," A. Heard, The Costs of Democ-racy 143, 144 (1960), or the practice of " `beer politics,' "
whereby "wholesale liquor licenses issued by the state were
traded for campaign contributions," id., at 144, or the extortion of political support and "campaign contributions" on
pain of being branded a "Communist," R. Caro, The Power

or the "favorable consideration in the courts or by public

businessman who was reluctant to contribute to a mayoralty
campaign, " `Look, you [expletive deleted], do you want a
snow-removal contract or don't you?,' " id., at 368. These
examples, cited by the dissent, many of which involve patronage in employment and appointments rather than in
contracting, cf. Comment, Political Patronage, at 518, n. 4
("[P]atronage systems have traditionally centered around
the distribution of government jobs" (emphasis added)), may
suggest that abuses of power in the name of patronage are
not "highly unusual," post, at 710. It may also be the case
that the victims whose speech is chilled and whose contributions are extracted by such government action are often
" `honorable and prudent businessmen.' " Post, at 689 (quoting Heard, supra, at 145). But the dissent's examples do not
establish an "open and unchallenged" tradition of allocating
government contracts on the basis of political bias--much

less on the basis of disapproval of political speech. The dis-sent's own sources note that the patronage practices that

they report were denied and disavowed by their allegedpractitioners, see Wolfinger, supra, at 367, n. 2, 372-373,
n. 11, that they were most significant in secret and special-ized contexts such as defense contracting that "operat[e] in
an atmosphere uninhibited by the usual challenges of repre-sentative government," Tolchin,

supra, at 233, and that inmany cases they were illegal, see Heard, supra, at 143-144,

n. 4. We of course agree with the dissent that mere "obnox-ious[ness]," post, at 690, and criminality do not make a practice unconstitutional. Nor, however, do the dissent's exam-ples of covert, widely condemned, and sometimes illegal
government action legitimize the government discriminationbased on the viewpoint of one's speech or one's political affiliations that is involved here. 2

The dissent's own description of the "lowest-responsible-bidder" and other, similar requirements covering a wide
range of government contracts that the Federal Govern-ment, all 50 States, and many local government authorities,
have voluntarily adopted, see post, at 690-695, at least sug-gests that government contracting norms incompatible with
political bias have proliferated without unduly burdening thegovernment. In fact, lowest- and lowest-responsible-bidder
requirements have a long history, as a survey of 19th centurystate constitutions and federal territorial legislation reveals.

We are aware of no evidence of excessive or abusive litigation under such provisions. And, unlike the dissent, post, at
699-700, we do not believe that a deferentially administered
requirement that the government not unreasonably terminate its commercial relationships on the basis of speech or
political affiliation poses a greater threat to legitimate government interests than the complex and detailed array of
modern statutory and regulatory government contracting
rules.

In sum, neither the Board nor Umbehr have persuaded
us that there is a "difference of constitutional magnitude,"
Lefkowitz, 414 U. S., at 83, between independent contractors and employees in this context. Independent government contractors are similar in most relevant respects to
government employees, although both the speaker's and the
government's interests are typically--though not always--
somewhat less strong in the independent contractor case.

Opinion of the Court
We therefore conclude that the same form of balancing analy-sis should apply to each.

III
Because the courts below assumed that Umbehr's termina-tion (or nonrenewal) was in retaliation for his protected

speech activities, and because they did not pass on the bal-ance between the government's interests and the free speech
interests at stake, our conclusion that independent contrac-tors do enjoy some First Amendment protection requires
that we affirm the Tenth Circuit's decision to remand thecase. To prevail, Umbehr must show that the termination
of his contract was motivated by his speech on a matter ofpublic concern, an initial showing that requires him to prove
more than the mere fact that he criticized the Board mem-bers before they terminated him. If he can make that showing, the Board will have a valid defense if it can show, by apreponderance of the evidence, that, in light of their knowledge, perceptions, and policies at the time of the termination,the Board members would have terminated the contract regardless of his speech. See Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v.
Doyle, 429 U. S. 274 (1977). The Board will also prevail if itcan persuade the District Court that the County's legitimate

interests as contractor, deferentially viewed, outweigh thefree speech interests at stake. And, if Umbehr prevails,
evidence that the Board members discovered facts after ter-mination that would have led to a later termination anyway,
and evidence of mitigation of his loss by means of his subsequent contracts with the cities, would be relevant in assess-ing what remedy is appropriate.

Finally, we emphasize the limited nature of our decision
today. Because Umbehr's suit concerns the termination ofa pre-existing commercial relationship with the government,

we need not address the possibility of suits by bidders orapplicants for new government contracts who cannot rely on
such a relationship.

Scalia, J., dissenting
Subject to these limitations and caveats, however, we rec-ognize the right of independent government contractors not

to be terminated for exercising their First Amendmentrights. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is, therefore,
affirmed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistentwith this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,dissenting.*

Taken together, today's decisions in Board of Comm'rs,
Wabaunsee Cty. v. Umbehr, ante, p. 668, and O'Hare Truck
Service, Inc. v. City of Northlake, post, p. 712, demonstratewhy this Court's Constitution-making process can be called

"reasoned adjudication" only in the most formalistic sense.

I
Six years ago, by the barest of margins, the Court ex-panded

Elrod v. Burns, 427 U. S. 347 (1976), and Branti v.Finkel, 445 U. S. 507 (1980), which had held that public employees cannot constitutionally be fired on the basis of theirpolitical affiliation, to establish the new rule that applicants
for public employment cannot constitutionally be rejected onthe basis of their political affiliation. Rutan v. Republican
Party of Ill., 497 U. S. 62 (1990). The four dissenters arguedthat "the desirability of patronage is a policy question to
be decided by the people's representatives" and "a politicalquestion if there ever was one."

Id., at 104, 114 (Scalia, J.,dissenting). They were "convinced" that Elrod and Branti

had been "wrongly decided," 497 U. S., at 114; indeed, thatthose cases were "not only wrong, not only recent, not only
contradicted by a long prior tradition, but also . . . unwork-able in practice" and therefore "should be overruled,"

id.,

at 110-111. At the very least, the dissenters maintained,Elrod and Branti "should not be extended beyond their

facts." 497 U. S., at 114.Today, with the addition to the Court of another Justice
who believes that we have no basis for proscribing as uncon-stitutional practices that do not violate any explicit text of
the Constitution and that have been regarded as constitu-tional ever since the framing, see,

e. g., Bennis v. Michigan,516 U. S. 442, 454-455 (1996) (
Thomas, J., concurring), onewould think it inconceivable that

Elrod and Branti wouldbe extended far beyond Rutan to the massive field of all

government contracting. Yet amazingly, that is what theCourt does in these two opinions--and by lopsided votes, at
that. It is profoundly disturbing that the varying politicalpractices across this vast country, from coast to coast, can be
transformed overnight by an institution whose conviction ofwhat the Constitution means is so fickle.

The basic reason for my dissent today is the same as oneof the reasons I gave (this one not joined by

Justice O'Connor) in Rutan:

"[W]hen a practice not expressly prohibited by the textof the Bill of Rights bears the endorsement of a long

tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use thatdates back to the beginning of the Republic, we have no
proper basis for striking it down. Such a venerable andaccepted tradition is not to be laid on the examining
table and scrutinized for its conformity to some abstractprinciple of First Amendment adjudication devised by
this Court. To the contrary, such traditions are them-selves the stuff out of which the Court's principles are
to be formed. They are, in these uncertain areas, thevery points of reference by which the legitimacy or illegitimacy of other practices is to be figured out. Whenit appears that the latest `rule,' or `three-part test,' or
`balancing test' devised by the Court has placed us on acollision course with such a landmark practice, it is the

former that must be recalculated by us, and not the lat-ter that must be abandoned by our citizens. I know of

no other way to formulate a constitutional jurisprudencethat reflects, as it should, the principles adhered to, over
time, by the American people, rather than those favoredby the personal (and necessarily shifting) philosophical
dispositions of a majority of this Court." 497 U. S., at95-96 (dissenting opinion) (footnote omitted).

There can be no dispute that, like rewarding one's allies,the correlative act of refusing to reward one's opponents--
and at bottom both of today's cases involve exactly that--isan American political tradition as old as the Republic. This
is true not only with regard to employment matters, as Jus-tice Powell discussed in his dissenting opinions in

Elrod,supra, at 377-379, and Branti, supra, at 522, n. 1, but also in

the area of government contracts, see, e. g., M. Tolchin &S. Tolchin, To the Victor: Political Patronage from the Clubhouse to the White House 14-15, 61, 233-241, 273-277 (1971);A. Heard, The Costs of Democracy 143-145 (1960); R. Caro,
The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York723-726, 738, 740-741, 775, 799, 927 (1975); M. Royko, Boss:
Richard J. Daley of Chicago 69 (1971); Wolfinger, Why Politi-cal Machines Have Not Withered Away and Other Revisionist Thoughts, 34 J. Politics 365, 367-368, 372, 389 (1972); TheBond Game Remains the Same, Nat. L. J., July 1, 1996,
pp. A1, A20-A21. If that long and unbroken tradition of ourpeople does not decide these cases, then what does? The
constitutional text is assuredly as susceptible of one meaningas of the other; in that circumstance, what constitutes a "law
abridging the freedom of speech" is either a matter of historyor else it is a matter of opinion. Why are not libel laws such
an "abridgment"? The only satisfactory answer is that theynever were. What secret knowledge, one must wonder, is
breathed into lawyers when they become Justices of thisCourt, that enables them to discern that a practice which the

Scalia, J., dissenting
text of the Constitution does not clearly proscribe, and which
our people have regarded as constitutional for 200 years, is
in fact unconstitutional?

The Court seeks to avoid the charge that it ignores the
centuries-old understandings and practices of our people by
recounting, Umbehr, ante, at 681-683, shocking examples of
raw political patronage in contracting, most of which would
be unlawful under the most rudimentary bribery law. (It
selects, of course, only the worst examples from the sources
I have cited, omitting the more common practices that permit one author to say, with undeniable accuracy, that "honorable and prudent businessmen competing for government
ventures make campaign contributions" out of "a desire to
do what [is] thought necessary to remain eligible," and that
"[m]any contractors routinely do so to both parties." Heard,
supra, at 145.) These "examples of covert, widely condemned, and sometimes illegal government action," it says,
do not "legitimize the government discrimination." Umbehr, ante, at 683. But of course it is not the county's or
city's burden (or mine) to "legitimize" all patronage practices; it is Umbehr's and O'Hare's (and the Court's) to show
that all patronage practices are not only "illegitimate" in
some vague moral or even precise legal sense, but that they
are unconstitutional. It suffices to demonstrate the error
of the Court's opinions that many contracting patronage
practices have been open, widespread, and unchallenged
since the beginning of the Republic; and that those that have
been objected to have not been objected to on constitutional
grounds. That the Court thinks it relevant that many patronage practices are "covert, widely condemned and sometimes illegal" merely displays its persistent tendency to
equate those many things that are or should be proscribed
as a matter of social policy with those few things that we
have the power to proscribe under the Constitution. The
relevant and inescapable point is this: No court ever held,

Scalia, J., dissenting
and indeed no one ever thought, prior to our decisions inElrod and Branti, that patronage contracting could violate

the First Amendment. The Court's attempt to contest thispoint, or at least to becloud the issue, by appeal to obnoxious
and universally condemned patronage practices simply dis-plays the feebleness of its case.

In each case today, the Court observes that we "have longsince rejected Justice Holmes' famous dictum, that a policeman `may have a constitutional right to talk politics, but hehas no constitutional right to be a policeman.' "

Umbehr,ante, at 674 (quoting McAuliffe v. Mayor of New Bedford,

155 Mass. 216, 220, 29 N. E. 517 (1892)); see O'Hare, post, at716-717 (quoting same). But this activist Court also repeatedly rejects a more important aphorism of Justice Holmes,which expresses a fundamental philosophy that was once an
inseparable part of our approach to constitutional law. In acase challenging the constitutionality of a federal estate tax
on the ground that it was an unapportioned direct tax inviolation of Article I, $ 9, Justice Holmes wrote:

"[The] matter . . . is disposed of . . . , not by an attemptto make some scientific distinction, which would be at
least difficult, but on an interpretation of language by itstraditional use--on the practical and historical ground
that this kind of tax always has been regarded as theantithesis of a direct tax . . . . Upon this point a page
of history is worth a volume of logic." New York TrustCo. v. Eisner, 256 U. S. 345, 349 (1921) (emphasis added).

II
The Court's decision to enter this field cannot be justifiedby the consideration (if it were ever a justification) that the

democratic institutions of government have not been payingadequate attention to the problems it presents. The American people have evidently decided that political influence ingovernment contracting, like many other things that are

entirely constitutional, is not entirely desirable, and so they
have set about passing laws to prohibit it in some but not
all instances. As a consequence, government contracting is
subject to the most extraordinary number of laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local levels.

The United States Code contains a categorical statutory
prohibition on political contributions by those negotiating
for or performing contracts with the Federal Government,
2 U. S. C. $ 441c, competitive bidding requirements for contracts with executive agencies, 41 U. S. C. $$ 252-253, public corruption and bribery statutes, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 201,
and countless other statutory requirements that restrict
Government officials' discretion in awarding contracts.
"There are already over four thousand individual statutory
provisions that affect the [Defense Department's] procurement process." Pyatt, Procurement Competition at Work:
The Navy's Experience, 6 Yale J. Reg. 319, 319-320 (1989).
Federal regulations are even more widespread. As one
handbook in the area has explained, "[t]heir procedural and
substantive requirements dictate, to an oftentimes astonishing specificity, how the entire contracting process will be conducted." ABA General Practice Section, Federal Procurement Regulations: Policy, Practice and Procedures 1 (1987).
That is why it is no surprise in this area to find a 253-page
book just setting forth "fundamentals," E. Massengale, Fundamentals of Federal Contract Law (1991), or a mere "deskbook" that runs 436 pages, ABA Section of Public Contract
Law, Government Contract Law: The Deskbook for Procurement Professionals (1995). Such "summaries" are indispensable when, for example, the regulations that constitute the
"Federal Acquisition Regulations System" total some 5,037
pages of fine print. See Title 48 CFR (1995).

Similar systems of detailed statutes and regulations exist
throughout the States. In addition to the various statutes

ing is such a standard area for state regulation that a modelprocurement code has been developed, which is set forth in

a 265-page book complete with proposed statutes, regula-tions, and explanations. See ABA Section of Urban, State
and Local Government Law, Model Procurement Code forState and Local Governments (1981). As of 1989, 15 States
had enacted legislation based on the model code. See ABASection of Urban, State and Local Government Law, Annotations to the Model Procurement Code vii-viii (2d ed. 1992)(and statutes cited).

By 1992, more than 25 local jurisdictions had also adoptedlegislation based on the Model Procurement Code, see

id., atix, and thousands of other counties and municipalities have

over time devised their own measures. New York City, forexample, which "[e]ach year . . . enter[s] into approximately
40,000 contracts worth almost $6.5 billion," has regulated thepublic contracting process by a myriad of codes and regulations that seek to assure "scrupulous neutrality in choos-ing contractors and [consequently impose] multiple layers of
investigation and accountability." Anechiarico & Jacobs,Purging Corruption from Public Contracting: The `Solutions'

have been regulated, and the way in which public policy
problems that arise in the area have been addressed, since
the founding of the Republic. See, e. g., Federal Procurement Regulations: Policy, Practice and Procedures, at 11-196
(describing the history of Federal Government procurement
regulation). But these laws and regulations have brought
to the field a degree of discrimination, discernment, and predictability that cannot be achieved by the blunt instrument
of a constitutional prohibition.

Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations would not contain the 5,000+ pages it does if it did not make fine distinctions, permitting certain actions in some Government acquisition areas and prohibiting them in others. Similarly, many

cal unit's decision not to enact contracting regulations, or tosuspend the regulations in certain circumstances, amounts

to a decision to permit some degree of political favoritism.As I shall discuss shortly, O'Hare's and Umbehr's First
Amendment permits no such selectivity--or at least nonethat can be known before litigation is over.

III
If inattention by the democratic organs of government isnot a plausible reason for the Court's entry into the field,

then what is? I believe the Court accepts (any sane person
must accept) the premise that it is utterly impossible toerect, and enforce through litigation, a system in which no

citizen is intentionally disadvantaged by the government be-cause of his political beliefs. I say the Court accepts that,
because the O'Hare opinion, in a rare brush with the realworld, points out that "O'Hare was not part of a constituency
that must take its chance of being favored or ignored in thelarger political process--for example, by residing or doing
business in a region the government rewards or spurns inthe construction of public works."

Post, at 720-721. Ofcourse. Government favors those who agree with its political views, and disfavors those who disagree, every day--inwhere it builds its public works, in the kinds of taxes it imposes and collects, in its regulatory prescriptions, in the de-sign of its grant and benefit programs--in a

million ways,including the letting of contracts for government business.

What good reason has the Court given for separating outthis last way, and declaring it to be (as all the others for some
reason are not) an "abridgment of the freedom of speech"?As I have explained, I would separate the permissible
from the impermissible on the basis of our Nation's tradi-tions, which is what I believe sound constitutional adjudication requires. In Elrod and Branti, the Court rejected thiscriterion--but if what it said did not make good constitutional law, at least it made some sense: the loss of one's job

is a powerful price to pay for one's politics. But the Courtthen found itself on the fabled slippery slope that Justice

Holmes's aphorism about history and logic warned about: onelogical proposition detached from history leads to another,
until the Court produces a result that bears no resemblanceto the America that we know. The next step was

Rutan,which extended the prohibition of political motivation from

firing to hiring. The third step is today's Umbehr, whichextends it to the termination of a government contract.
And the fourth step (as I shall discuss anon) is today'sO'Hare, which extends it to the refusal to enter into contractual relationships.If it is to be possible to dig in our cleats at some point on
this slope--before we end up holding that the First Amend-ment requires the city of Chicago to have as few potholes in
Republican wards (if any) as in Democratic ones--would notthe most defensible point of termination for this indefensible
exercise be public employment? A public employee is al-ways an individual, and a public employee below the highest
political level (which is exempt from Elrod) is virtually al-ways an individual who is not rich; the termination or denial
of a public job is the termination or denial of a livelihood.A public contractor, on the other hand, is usually a corporation; and the contract it loses is rarely its entire business, oreven an indispensable part of its entire business. As Judge
Posner put it:

"Although some business firms sell just to government, most government contractors also have privatecustomers. If the contractor does not get the particular

government contract on which he bids, because he is on
the outs with the incumbent and the state does not havelaws requiring the award of the contract to the low bidder (or the laws are not enforced), it is not the end ofthe world for him; there are other government entities
to bid to, and private ones as well. It is not like losing

your job." LaFalce v. Houston, 712 F. 2d 292, 294
(CA7 1983).

Another factor that suggests we should stop this new enterprise at government employment is the much greater volume of litigation that its extension to the field of contracting
entails. The government contracting decisions worth litigating about are much more numerous than the number of
personnel hirings and firings in that category; and the litigation resources of contractors are infinitely more substantial
than those of fired employees or rejected applicants. Anyone who has had even brief exposure to the intricacies of
federal contracting law knows that a lawsuit is often used as
a device to stay or frustrate the award of a contract to a
competitor. See, e. g., Delta Data Systems Corp. v. Webster,
744 F. 2d 197 (CADC 1984); Delta Data Systems Corp. v.
Webster, 755 F. 2d 938 (CADC 1985). What the Court's decisions today mean is that all government entities, no matter
how small, are at risk of $ 1983 lawsuits for violation of constitutional rights, unless they adopt (at great cost in money
and efficiency) the detailed and cumbersome procedures that
make a claim of political favoritism (and a $ 1983 lawsuit)
easily defended against.

The Court's opinion in O'Hare shrugs off this concern with
the response that "[w]e have no reason to believe that governments cannot bear a like burden [to that in the employment context] in defending against suits alleging the
denial of First Amendment freedoms to public contractors."
Post, at 724. The burden is, as I have suggested, likely
much greater than that in the employment context; and the
relevant question (if one rejects history as the determinant)
is not simply whether the governments "can bear" it, but
whether the inconvenience of bearing it is outbalanced by
the degree of abridgment of supposed First Amendment
rights (of corporate shareholders, for the most part) that

Scalia, J., dissenting
would occur if the burden were not imposed.5 The Court
in Umbehr dismisses the risk of litigation, not by analogy
to the employment context, but by analogy to the many
government-contracting laws of the type I have discussed.
"We are aware," it says, "of no evidence of excessive
or abusive litigation under such provisions." Ante, at 684.
I am not sure the Court would be aware of such evidence
if it existed, but if in fact litigation has been "nonexcessive" (a conveniently imprecise term) under these provisions, that is scant indication that it will be "nonexcessive"
under the First Amendment. Uncertainty breeds litigation.
Government-contracting laws are clear and detailed, and
whether they have been violated is typically easy to as5 O'Hare makes a brief attempt to minimize the seriousness of the litigation concern, pointing out that "[t]he amicus brief filed on behalf of respondents' position represents that in the six years since our opinion in
[Rutan] . . . only 18 suits alleging First Amendment violations in employment decisions have been filed against Illinois state officials." Post, at
724. In fact the brief said "at least eighteen cases," Brief for Illinois
State Officials as Amici Curiae 3 (emphasis added), and that includes only
suits against state officials, and not those against the officials of Illinois'
102 counties or its even more numerous municipalities. Those statistics
pertain to employment suits, moreover--and as I have discussed, the contracting suits will be much more numerous.

O'Hare also says that "we have found no reported case in the Tenth
Circuit involving a First Amendment patronage claim by an independent
contractor in the six years since its Court of Appeals first recognized such
claims, see Abercrombie v. Catoosa, 896 F. 2d 1228 (1990)." Post, at 724.
With respect, Abercrombie (which discussed this issue in two short paragraphs) was such an obscure case that even the District Court in Umbehr,
located in the Tenth Circuit, did not cite it, though it discussed cases in
other jurisdictions. Umbehr v. McClure, 840 F. Supp. 837 (Kan. 1993).
And when the Tenth Circuit reversed the District Court, it did not do so
on the basis of Abercrombie--which, it noted, had "simply assumed that
an independent contractor could assert a First Amendment retaliation
claim" and had given "little reasoning" to the matter but merely so "suggested, without analysis." 44 F. 3d 876, 880 (1995) (emphasis added).
Abercrombie was, in short, such a muffled clarion that even the courts did
not hear it, much less the public at large.

certain: the contract was put out for bid, or it was not.
Umbehr's new First Amendment, by contrast, requires a
sensitive "balancing" in each case; and the factual question
whether political affiliation or disfavored speech was the reason for the award or loss of the contract will usually be litigable. In short, experience under the government-contracting
laws has little predictive value.

The Court additionally asserts that the line cannot be
drawn between employment and independent contracting,
because " `the applicability of a provision of the Constitution
has never depended on the vagaries of state or federal law.' "
Umbehr, ante, at 680 (quoting Browning-Ferris Industries
of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 299 (1989)
(O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part));
see also Umbehr, ante, at 678-680 (citing other cases). That
is not so. State law frequently plays a dispositive role in
the issue whether a constitutional provision is applicable.
In fact, before we invented the First Amendment right not
to be fired for political views, most litigation in this very field
of government employment revolved around the Fourteenth
Amendment's Due Process Clause and asked whether the
firing had deprived the plaintiff of a "property" interest
without due process. And what is a property interest entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection? "[P]roperty
interests," we said, "are not created by the Constitution.
Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by
existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law . . . . If it is the law of Texas
that a teacher in the respondent's position has no contractual
or other claim to job tenure, the respondent's [federal constitutional] claim would be defeated." Perry v. Sindermann,
408 U. S. 593, 602, n. 7 (1972) (internal quotation marks and
citation omitted). See also Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v.
Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 280-281 (1977) (whether a government
entity possesses Eleventh Amendment immunity "depends,

at least in part, upon the nature of the entity created bystate law").

I have spoken thus far as though the only problem involvedhere were a practical one: as though, in the best of all possible worlds, if our judicial system and the resources of our
governmental entities could only manage it, it would be desirable for an individual to suffer no disadvantage whatever
at the hands of the government solely because of his politicalviews--no denial of employment, no refusal of contracts, no

discrimination in social programs, not even any potholes.But I do not believe that. The First Amendment guarantees that you and I can say and believe whatever we like
(subject to a few tradition-based exceptions, such as obscenity and "fighting words") without going to jail or being fined.
What it ought to guarantee beyond that is not at all the
simple question the Court assumes. The ability to discourage eccentric views through the mild means that have historically been employed, and that the Court has now set its face
against, may well be important to social cohesion. To take
an uncomfortable example from real life: An organization (I
shall call it the White Aryan Supremacist Party, though that
was not the organization involved in the actual incident I
have in mind) is undoubtedly entitled, under the Constitution, to maintain and propagate racist and antisemitic views.
But when the Department of Housing and Urban Development lets out contracts to private security forces to maintain
law and order in units of public housing, must it really treat
this bidder the same as all others? Or may it determine
that the views of this organization are not political views
that it wishes to "subsidize" with public funds, nor political
views that it wishes to hold up as an exemplar of the law to
the residents of public housing?

The state and local regulation I described earlier takes
account of this reality. Even where competitive-bidding requirements are applicable (which is far from always), they
almost invariably require that a contract be awarded not to

the lowest bidder but to the "lowest responsible bidder." 6"The word `responsible' is as important as the word `lowest,' " H. Cohen, Public Construction Contracts and the Law81 (1961), and has been interpreted in some States to permit
elected officials to exercise political discretion. "Some NewYork courts," for example, "have upheld agency refusals to
award a contract to a low bidder because the contractor,while technically and financially capable, was not morally responsible." Anechiarico & Jacobs 146-147. In the leadingcase of

Picone v. New York, 176 Misc. 967, 29 N. Y. S. 2d 539(Sup. Ct. N. Y. Cty. 1941), the court stated that in determining whether a lowest bidder for a particular contract wasthe "lowest responsible bidder," New York City officials had
permissibly considered "whether [the bidder] possessed in-tegrity and moral worth."

Id., at 969, 29 N. Y. S. 2d, at 541.The New Jersey Supreme Court has similarly said: "It is

settled that the legislative mandate that a bidder be `respon-sible' embraces moral integrity just as surely as it embraces
a capacity to supply labor and materials." Trap Rock Industries, Inc. v. Kohl, 59 N. J. 471, 481, 284 A. 2d 161, 166(1971). In the future, presumably, this will be permitted

only if the disfavored moral views of the bidder have neverbeen verbalized, for otherwise the First Amendment will
produce entitlement to the contract, or at least guaranteea lawsuit.

In treading into this area, "we have left the realm of lawand entered the domain of political science."

Rutan, 497U. S., at 113 (
Scalia, J., dissenting). As Judge Posnerrightly perceived, the issue that the Court today disposes of

like some textbook exercise in logic "raises profound ques-tions of political science that exceed judicial competence to
answer." LaFalce v. Houston, 712 F. 2d, at 294.

IV
If, however, the Court is newly to announce that it hasdiscovered that the granting or withholding of a contract is

a First Amendment issue, a coherent statement of the newlaw is the least that those who labor in the area are entitled
to expect. They do not get it from today's decisions, whichcontradict each other on a number of fundamental points.

The decision in Umbehr appears to be an improvement onour

Elrod-Branti-Rutan trilogy in one sense. Rutan, themost recent of these decisions, provided that the government

could justify patronage employment practices only if itproved that such patronage was "narrowly tailored to further vital governmental interests." 497 U. S., at 74. Thefour of us in dissent explained that "[t]hat strict-scrutiny
standard finds no support in our cases," and we argued that,if the new constitutional right was to be invented, the criterion for violation should be "the test announced in Picker-ing [v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205,
Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563 (1968)]." Id., at 98, 100 (opinion of
Scalia, J.). It thus appears a happy development that theCourt in

Umbehr explicitly rejects the suggestion, urged byUmbehr and by the United States as amicus curiae, that "on

proof of viewpoint-based retaliation for contractors' politicalspeech, the government should be required to justify its actions as narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state inter-est,"

ante, at 676; accord, ante, at 678, and instead holds "thatthe Pickering balancing test, adjusted to weigh the government's interests as contractor rather than as employer, de-termines the extent of [independent contractors'] protection"
under the First Amendment, ante, at 673. Pickering bal-ancing, of course, requires a case-by-case assessment of the
government's and the contractor's interests. "Pickeringand its progeny . . . involve a

post hoc analysis of one employ-ee's speech and its impact on that employee's public responsibilities." United States v. Treasury Employees, 513 U. S.454, 466-467 (1995). See also id., at 480-481 (

Pickering requires "case-by-case application"); Rankin v.
McPherson, 483 U. S. 378, 388-392 (1987); Connick v. Myers,461 U. S. 138, 150-154 (1983);

Pickering v. Board of Ed. of
Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563,
568-573 (1968). It is clear that this is what the Court's opin-ion in

Umbehr anticipates: "a fact-sensitive and deferential
weighing of the government's legitimate interests," ante, at677 (emphasis added), which accords "[d]eference . . . to the

government's reasonable assessments of its interests as con-tractor,"

ante, at 678 (emphasis deleted). "[S]uch a nuanced
approach," Umbehr says, "which recognizes the variety ofinterests that may arise in independent contractor cases, is

superior to a bright-line rule." Ibid.

What the Court sets down in Umbehr, however, it rips upin

O'Hare. In Part III of that latter opinion, where the
Court makes its application of the First Amendment to the
facts of the case, there is to be found not a single reference
to Pickering. See post, at 720-726. Indeed, what is quite
astonishing, the Court concludes that it "need not inquire"
into any government interests that patronage contracting
may serve--even generally, much less in the particular case
at hand--"for Elrod and Branti establish that patronage
does not justify the coercion of a person's political beliefs and
associations." Post, at 718. Leaving aside that there is no
coercion here,7 the assertion obviously contradicts the need
for "balancing" announced in the companion Umbehr decision. This rejection of "balancing" is evident elsewhere in
O'Hare--as when the Court rejects as irrelevant the Seventh

7 As the dissenters in Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497 U. S. 62
(1990), agreed: "[I]t greatly exaggerates [the constraints entailed by patronage] to call them `coercion' at all, since we generally make a distinction
between inducement and compulsion. The public official offered a bribe
is not `coerced' to violate the law, and the private citizen offered a patronage job is not `coerced' to work for the party." Id., at 109-110 (Scalia,
J., dissenting).

Circuit's observation in LaFalce v. Houston, 712 F. 2d 292(1983), that some contractors elect to "curr[y] favor with

diverse political parties," on the ground that the fact"[t]hat some citizens [thus] find a way to mitigate governmental overreaching, or refrain from complaining,
does not excuse wrongs done to those who exercise theirrights."

Post, at 724. But whether the government action
at issue here is a "wrong" is precisely the issue in thiscase, which we thought (per

Umbehr) was to be determined
by "balancing."One would have thought these two opinions the products

of the courts of last resort of two different legal systems,
presenting fertile material for a comparative-law course on
freedom of speech were it not for a single paragraph in
O'Hare, a veritable deus ex machina of legal analysis, which
reconciles the irreconcilable. The penultimate paragraph of
that portion of the O'Hare opinion which sets forth the general principles of law governing the case, see post, at 719,
advises that henceforth "the freedom of speech" alluded to
in the Bill of Rights will be divided into two categories: (1)
the "right of free speech," where "we apply the balancing
test from Pickering," and (since this "right of free speech"
presumably does not exhaust the Free Speech Clause) (2)
"political affiliation," where we apply the rigid rule of Elrod
and Branti. The Court (or at least the O'Hare Court) says
that "[t]here is an advantage in so confining the inquiry
where political affiliation alone is concerned, for one's beliefs
and allegiances ought not to be subject to probing or testing
by the government." Post, at 719.

Frankly, the only "advantage" I can discern in this novel
distinction is that it provides some explanation (no matter
how difficult to grasp) of how these two opinions can issue
from the same Court on the same day. It raises many questions. Does the "right of free speech" (category (1), that
is) come into play if the contractor not only is a Republican,
but says, "I am a Republican"? (At that point, of course,

518us3$87K 05-20-99 19:19:23 PAGES OPINPGT

705Cite as: 518 U. S. 668 (1996)
Scalia, J., dissenting
the fatal need for "probing or testing" his allegiance disappears.) Or is the "right of free speech" at issue only if he
goes still further, and says, "I believe in the principles set
forth in the Republican platform"? Or perhaps one must
decide whether the Rubicon between the "right of free
speech" and the more protected "political affiliation" has
been crossed on the basis of the contracting authority's motivation, so that it does not matter whether the contractor
says he is a Republican, or even says that he believes in the
Republican platform, so long as the reason he is disfavored is
simply that (whatever he says or believes) he is a Republican.
But the analysis would change, perhaps, if the contracting
authority really has nothing against Republicans as such, but
can't stand people who believe what the Republican platform
stands for. Except perhaps it would not change if the contractor never actually said he was a Republican--or perhaps
only if he never actually said that he believed in the Republican platform. The many variations will provide endless
diversion for the courts of appeals.

If one is so sanguine as to believe that facts involving the
"right of free speech" and facts involving "political affiliation" can actually be segregated into separate categories,
there arises, of course, the problem of what to do when both
are involved. One would expect the more rigid test (Elrod
nonbalancing) to prevail. That is certainly what happens
elsewhere in the law. If one is categorically liable for a defamatory statement, but liable for a threatening statement
only if it places the subject in immediate fear of physical
harm, an utterance that combines both ("Sir, I shall punch
you in your lying mouth!") would be (at least as to the defamatory portion) categorically actionable. Not so, however,
with our new First Amendment law. Where, we are told,
"specific instances of the employee's speech or expression,
which require balancing in the Pickering context, are intermixed with a political affiliation requirement," balancing

rather than categorical liability will be the result. O'Hare,
post, at 719.

Were all this confusion not enough, the explanatory para-graph makes doubly sure it is not setting forth any comprehensible rule by adding, immediately after its description of
how Elrod, rather than the Pickering balancing test, appliesin "political affiliation" cases, the following: "It is true, on

the other hand, . . . that the inquiry is whether the affiliationrequirement is a reasonable one, so it is inevitable that some
case-by-case adjudication will be required even where po-litical affiliation is the test the government has imposed."
O'Hare, post, at 719. As I said in Rutan, "[w]hat that meansis anybody's guess." 497 U. S., at 111 (dissenting opinion).
Worse still, we learn that O'Hare itself, where the Court does
not conduct balancing, may "perhaps [be] includ[ed]" among"those many cases . . . which require balancing" because it

is one of the "intermixed" cases I discussed in the paragraphimmediately above.

Post, at 719. Why, then, one is inclined to ask, did not the Court conduct balancing?The answer is contained in the next brief paragraph of the

O'Hare opinion:

"The Court of Appeals, based on its understanding of
the pleadings, considered this simply an affiliation case,and held, based on Circuit precedent, there was no constitutional protection for one who was simply an outsidecontractor. We consider the case in those same terms,
but we disagree with the Court of Appeals' conclusion."
Post, at 720.

This is a deus ex machina sent in to rescue the Court's deus
ex machina, which was itself overwhelmed by the plot of
this tragedy of inconsistency. Unfortunately, this adjutor
adjutoris (to overextend, perhaps, my classical analogy) is
also unequal to the task: The respondent in this case is entitled to defend the judgment in its favor on the basis of the
facts as they were alleged, not as the Court of Appeals took

them to be. When, as here, "the decision we review adjudi-cated a motion to dismiss, we accept all of the factual allegations in petitioners' complaint as true and ask whether, inthese circumstances, dismissal of the complaint was appropriate." Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U. S. 531, 540 (1988)
(emphasis added). It is at least highly arguable that thecomplaint alleged what the Court calls a violation of the

"right of free speech" rather than merely the right of "politi-cal affiliation." The count at issue was entitled "FREEDOM
OF SPEECH," see App. in No. 95-191, p. 15, and contendedthat petitioners had been retaliated against because of "the
exercise of their constitutional right of freedom of speech,"
id., at 17. One of the two central factual allegations is the
following: "John A. Gratzianna openly supported Paxson's
opponent for the office of Mayor. Campaign posters for Paxson's opponent were displayed at plaintiff O'Hare's place of
business." Id., at 16. It is particularly inexcusable to hide
behind the Court of Appeals' treatment of this litigation as
"simply an affiliation case," since when the Court of Appeals
wrote its opinion the world had not yet learned that the Free
Speech Clause is divided into the two categories of "right of
free speech" and "political affiliation." As far as that court
knew, it could have substituted "freedom of speech" for "freedom of political affiliation" whenever it used the term, with
no effect on the outcome. It did not, in other words, remotely make a "finding" that the case involves only the right
of political affiliation. Unavoidably, therefore, if what the
O'Hare Court says in its first explanatory paragraph is to
be believed--that is, what it says in the latter part of that
paragraph, to the effect that "intermixed" cases are governed by Pickering--there is simply no basis for reversing
the Court of Appeals without balancing, and directing that
the case proceed, effectively depriving the city of its right to
judgment on the pleadings.

Unless, of course, Pickering balancing can never support
the granting of a motion to dismiss. That is the proposition

Scalia, J., dissenting
that today's O'Hare opinion, if it is not total confusion, muststand for. Nothing else explains how the Court can (1) assert that an "intermixed" case requires Pickering balancing,(2) acknowledge that the complaint here

may set forth an
"intermixed" case, and yet (3) reverse the dismissal without
determining whether the complaint does set forth an "inter-mixed" case and, if so, proceeding to conduct at least a preliminary Pickering balancing. There is of course no reasonin principle why this particular issue should be dismissal
proof, and the consequence of making it so, given the burdensof pretrial discovery (to say nothing of trial itself) will be to
make litigation on this subject even more useful as a device
for harassment and weapon of commercial competition. It
must be acknowledged, however, that proceeding this way in
the present case has one unquestionable advantage: it leaves
it entirely to the District Court to clean up, without any
guidance or assistance from us, the mess that we have
made--to figure out whether saying "Vote against Paxson,"
or "Paxson is a hack," or "Paxson's project for a 100,000-seat
municipal stadium is wasteful," or whatever else Mr. Gratzianna's campaign posters might have said, removes this case
from the Political Affiliation Clause of the Constitution and
places it within the Right of Free Speech Clause.

One final observation about the sweep of today's holdings.
The opinion in Umbehr, having swallowed the camel of First
Amendment extension into contracting, in its penultimate
paragraph demonstrates the Court's deep-down judicial conservatism by ostentatiously straining out the following gnat:
"Finally, we emphasize the limited nature of our decision
today. Because Umbehr's suit concerns the termination of
a pre-existing commercial relationship with the government,
we need not address the possibility of suits by bidders or
applicants for new government contracts who cannot rely on
such a relationship." Ante, at 685. The facts in Umbehr,
of course, involved the termination of nothing so vague as a
"commercial relationship with the government"; the Board

Scalia, J., dissenting
of Commissioners had terminated Umbehr's contract. Thefuzzier terminology is used, presumably, because

O'Hare did
not involve termination of a contract. As far as appears,O'Hare had not paid or promised anything to be placed on a

list of tow-truck operators who would be offered individual
contracts as they came up. The company had no right tosue if the city failed to call it, nor the city any right to sue if

the company turned down an offered tow. It had, in short,only what might be called (as an infinity of things might be
called) "a pre-existing commercial relationship" with thecity: it was one of the tow-truck operators they regularly
called. The quoted statement in Umbehr invites the bar to
believe, therefore, that the Court which declined to draw the
line of First Amendment liability short of firing from government employment (Elrod and Branti), short of nonhiring for
government employment (Rutan), short of termination of a
government contract (Umbehr), and short of denial of a government contract to someone who had a "pre-existing commercial relationship with the government" (O'Hare) may
take a firm stand against extending the Constitution into
every little thing when it comes to denying a government
contract to someone who had no "pre-existing commercial
relationship." Not likely; in fact, not even believable.

This Court has begun to make a habit of disclaiming
the natural and foreseeable jurisprudential consequences of
its pathbreaking (i. e., Constitution-making) opinions. Each
major step in the abridgment of the people's right to govern
themselves is portrayed as extremely limited or indeed sui
juris. In Romer v. Evans, 517 U. S. 620, 632, 633 (1996),
announced last month, the Court asserted that the Colorado
constitutional amendment at issue was so distinctive that it
"defies . . . conventional inquiry" and "confounds [the] normal
process of judicial review." In United States v. Virginia,
ante, at 534, n. 7, announced two days ago, the Court purported to address "specifically and only an educational opportunity recognized by the District Court and the Court of

Appeals as `unique.' " And in the cases announced today,"we emphasize the limited nature of our decision." Umbehr,

ante, at 685. The people should not be deceived. While thepresent Court sits, a major, undemocratic restructuring of
our national institutions and mores is constantly in progress.

* * *
They say hard cases make bad law. The cases before theCourt today set the blood boiling, with the arrogance that

they seem to display on the part of elected officials. Shallthe American System of Justice let insolent, petty-tyrant politicians get away with this? What one tends to forget isthat we have heard only the plaintiffs' tale. These suits
were dismissed before trial, so the "facts" the Court recitesin its opinions assume the truth of the allegations made (or
the preliminary evidence presented) by the plaintiffs. Wehave no idea whether the allegations are true or false--but
if they are true, they are certainly highly unusual. Electedofficials do not thrive on arrogance.

For every extreme case of the sort alleged here, I expectthere are thousands of contracts awarded on a "favoritism"
basis that no one would get excited about. The Democraticmayor gives the city's municipal bond business to what is
known to be a solid Democratic law firm--taking it awayfrom the solid Republican law firm that had the business during the previous, Republican, administration. What else isnew? Or he declines to give the construction contract for
the new municipal stadium to the company that opposed thebond issue for its construction, and that in fact tried to get
the stadium built across the river in the next State. Whatelse would you expect? Or he awards the cable monopoly,
not to the (entirely responsible) Johnny-come-lately, but tothe local company that has always been a "good citizen"--
which means it has supported with money, and the personalefforts of its management, civic initiatives that the vast majority of the electorate favor, though some oppose. Hooray!

Favoritism such as this happens all the time in Americanpolitical life, and no one has ever thought that it violated--

of all things--the First Amendment to the Constitution ofthe United States.

The Court must be living in another world. Day byday, case by case, it is busy designing a Constitution for
a country I do not recognize. Depending upon which oftoday's cases one chooses to consider authoritative, it has
either (O'Hare) thrown out vast numbers of practices thatare routine in American political life in order to get rid of
a few bad apples; or (Umbehr) with the same purpose inmind subjected those routine practices to endless, uncertain, case-by-case, balance-all-the-factors-and-who-knows-who-will-win litigation.

O'HARE TRUCK SERVICE, INC., et al. v. CITY OFNORTHLAKE

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 95-191. Argued March 20, 1996--Decided June 28, 1996
Respondent city maintains a rotation list of available companies to perform towing services at its request. Until the events recounted here,
the city's policy had been to remove companies from the list only for
cause. Petitioner O'Hare Truck Service, Inc., was removed from the
list after its owner, petitioner Gratzianna, refused to contribute to respondent mayor's reelection campaign and instead supported his opponent. Alleging that the removal was in retaliation for Gratzianna's
campaign stance and caused petitioners to lose substantial income, petitioners filed this suit under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. The District Court dismissed the complaint in conformity with Seventh Circuit precedent that
Elrod v. Burns, 427 U. S. 347 (plurality opinion), and Branti v. Finkel,
445 U. S. 507--in which the Court held that government officials may
not discharge public employees for refusing to support a political party
or its candidates, unless political affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the job in question--do not extend to independent contractors.
The Seventh Circuit affirmed.

Held: The protections of Elrod and Branti extend to an instance where

government retaliates against a contractor, or a regular provider of
services, for the exercise of rights of political association or the expression of political allegiance. Pp. 716-726.

(a) In assessing when party affiliation, consistent with the First
Amendment, may be an acceptable basis for terminating a public employee, "the ultimate inquiry is not whether the label `policymaker' or
`confidential' fits a particular position; rather, the question is whether
the hiring authority can demonstrate that party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the public office involved." Branti, supra, at 518. A different, though related, inquiry,
the balancing test from Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High
School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563, is called for where a government employer takes adverse action on account of an employee or service provider's right of free speech. In Elrod and Branti, the raw test of
political affiliation sufficed to show a constitutional violation. However,
since the inquiry is whether the affiliation requirement is reasonable, it
is inevitable that some case-by-case adjudication will be required even

Syllabus
where political affiliation was the test the government imposed. The
analysis will also accommodate cases where instances of the employee's
speech or expression are intermixed with a political affiliation requirement. Pp. 716-720.

(b) Despite respondents' argument that the principles of Elrod and
Branti have no force here because an independent contractor's First
Amendment rights, unlike a public employee's, must yield to the government's asserted countervailing interest in sustaining a patronage system, this Court cannot accept the proposition that those who perform
the government's work outside the formal employment relationship are
subject to the direct and specific abridgment of First Amendment rights
described in petitioners' complaint. The government may not coerce
support in the manner petitioners allege, unless it has some justification
beyond dislike of the individual's political association. As respondents
offer no other justification for their actions, the complaint states a First
Amendment claim. Allowing the constitutional claim to turn on a distinction between employees and independent contractors would invite
manipulation by government, which could avoid constitutional liability
simply by attaching different labels to particular jobs, Board of
Comm'rs, Wabaunsee Cty. v. Umbehr, ante, at 679. Accord, Lefkowitz
v. Turley, 414 U. S. 70. Respondents present no convincing data to
support their speculation that a difference of constitutional magnitude
exists because independent contractors are less dependent on the government for income than employees are. There is little reason to suppose that a decision in petitioners' favor will lead to numerous lawsuits.
While government officials may terminate at-will relationships, unmodified by any legal constraints, without cause, it does not follow that this
discretion can be exercised to impose conditions on expressing, or not
expressing, specific political views, see Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S.
593, 597. In view of the large number of legitimate reasons why a contracting decision might be made, fending off baseless First Amendment
lawsuits should not consume scarce government resources. If the government terminates its affiliation with a service provider for reasons
unrelated to political association, Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle,
429 U. S. 274, 287, as, for example, where the provider is unreliable, or
if the service provider's political "affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance" of the task in question, Branti,
supra, at 518, there will be no First Amendment violation. The absolute right to enforce a patronage scheme as a means of retaining control
over independent contractors and satisfying government officials' concerns about reliability has not been shown to be a necessary part of a
legitimate political system in all instances. This was the determination
controlling the Court's decisions in Elrod, supra, at 365-368, 372-373,

and Branti, supra, at 518-520. There is no basis for rejecting that
reasoning in this context and drawing a line excluding independent contractors from the First Amendment safeguards of political association
afforded to employees. Pp. 720-726.

(c) The lower courts, upon such further proceedings as are deemed
appropriate, should decide whether the case is governed by the ElrodBranti rule or by the Pickering rule. P. 726.

Government officials may not discharge public employeesfor refusing to support a political party or its candidates,

(1976); Branti v. Finkel, 445 U. S. 507 (1980). We must de-cide whether the protections of

Elrod and Branti extend toan independent contractor, who, in retaliation for refusing to

comply with demands for political support, has a governmentcontract terminated or is removed from an official list of contractors authorized to perform public services. Althoughthe government has broad discretion in formulating its contracting policies, we hold that the protections of Elrod and

Branti extend to an instance like the one before us, wheregovernment retaliates against a contractor, or a regular provider of services, for the exercise of rights of political associ-ation or the expression of political allegiance.

I
The suit having been dismissed by the District Court forfailure to state a claim, the complaint's factual allegations are

taken as true. Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics
Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U. S. 163, 164(1993). John Gratzianna is the owner and operator of

O'Hare Truck Service, which provides towing services inCook and DuPage Counties, Illinois. Gratzianna and his
company are petitioners here, and we sometimes refer tothem as O'Hare.

The city of Northlake, a respondent in this Court, coordi-nates towing services through its Police Department and for
at least 30 years has maintained a rotation list of availabletowing companies. When the police receive a tow request,
they call the company next on the list to provide the service.Until the events recounted here, the city's policy had been to
remove a tow truck operator from the rotation list only forcause. O'Hare had been on the list since 1965, performing
towing services at the city's request. O'Hare and the city'sformer Mayor, Gene Doyle, had a mutual understanding that
the city would maintain O'Hare's place on the rotation list solong as O'Hare provided good service. In 1989, soon after
being elected Northlake's new Mayor, respondent Reid Pax-son told Gratzianna he was pleased with O'Hare's work and
would continue using and referring its services.Four years later, when Paxson ran for reelection, his campaign committee asked Gratzianna for a contribution, whichGratzianna refused to make. Gratzianna instead supported
the campaign of Paxson's opponent and displayed the oppo-nent's campaign posters at O'Hare's place of business. Soon
after, O'Hare was removed from the rotation list. We shall

assume, as the complaint alleges, that the removal was inretaliation for Gratzianna's stance in the campaign. Petitioners allege the retaliation caused them to lose substan-tial income.

O'Hare and Gratzianna sued in the United States DistrictCourt for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging infringement of First Amendment rights in violation of Rev. Stat.$ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. In conformity with binding Seventh Circuit precedent, which does not extend Elrod and
Branti to independent contractors, see, e. g., DowntownAuto Parks, Inc. v. Milwaukee, 938 F. 2d 705, cert. denied,

502 U. S. 1005 (1991), the District Court dismissed the com-plaint, 843 F. Supp. 1231 (1994). The Court of Appeals for
the Seventh Circuit affirmed, adhering to the view that "itshould be up to the Supreme Court to extend

Elrod." 47F. 3d 883, 885 (1995). (The Court of Appeals also affirmed

dismissal of O'Hare's claim that respondents' failure to giveit notice of removal from the list or provide a hearing on the
matter deprived O'Hare of due process of law. That rulingis not before us.)

The Courts of Appeals take different positions concerning
Elrod and Branti's applicability to independent contractors.Compare 47 F. 3d 883 (1995) (opinion below); Horn v. Kean,

796 F. 2d 668 (CA3 1986) (en banc); Sweeney v. Bond, 669F. 2d 542 (CA8), cert. denied sub nom. Schenberg v. Bond,
459 U. S. 878 (1982), with Blackburn v. Marshall, 42 F. 3d925 (CA5 1995);

Abercrombie v. Catoosa, 896 F. 2d 1228(CA10 1990). We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict,

516 U. S. 1020, and now reverse.

II
The Court has rejected for decades now the propositionthat a public employee has no right to a government job and

so cannot complain that termination violates First Amend-ment rights, a doctrine once captured in Justice Holmes' aphorism that although a policeman "may have a constitutionalright to talk politics . . . he has no constitutional right to be

Opinion of the Court
a policeman," McAuliffe v. Mayor of New Bedford, 155 Mass.
216, 220, 29 N. E. 517 (1892). A State may not condition
public employment on an employee's exercise of his or her
First Amendment rights. See, e. g., Keyishian v. Board of
Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589 (1967); Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205,
Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563 (1968); Perry v. Sindermann, 408
U. S. 593 (1972). See also Board of Comm'rs, Wabaunsee
Cty. v. Umbehr, ante, at 674-675 (collecting cases). As we
have said: "[I]f the government could deny a benefit to a
person because of his constitutionally protected speech or
associations, his exercise of those freedoms would in effect
be penalized and inhibited. This would allow the government to `produce a result which [it] could not command directly.' Such interference with constitutional rights is impermissible." Perry v. Sindermann, supra, at 597, quoting
Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513, 526 (1958). Absent some
reasonably appropriate requirement, government may not
make public employment subject to the express condition of
political beliefs or prescribed expression.

In Elrod v. Burns, 427 U. S. 347 (1976), we considered
whether to apply the principles of the unconstitutional conditions cases to public employees dismissed on account of their
political association. In keeping with local tradition, a
newly elected county sheriff had discharged non-civil-service
employees because they were not members of his political
party. It was by no means self-evident whether our First
Amendment precedents applied, for as Justice Powell explained in dissent, id., at 377-387, the patronage practices at
issue had been sanctioned by history and had been thought
by some to contribute to the effective operation of political
parties. See also Branti v. Finkel, 445 U. S., at 522, n. 1,
527-532 (Powell, J., dissenting); Rutan v. Republican Party
of Ill., 497 U. S. 62, 104-109 (1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting).
If indeed those patronage practices fortify the party system,
they may serve important First Amendment interests, since

parties promote and generate political discourse, see, e. g.,
Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 14-15 (1976) (per curiam);
Democratic Party of United States v. Wisconsin ex rel. La
Follette, 450 U. S. 107, 121-122 (1981).

We need not inquire, however, whether patronage promotes the party system or serves instead to entrench partiesin power, see

Elrod v. Burns, supra, at 364-373 (plurality
opinion); Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., supra, at 88-89,n. 4 (

Stevens, J., concurring), for Elrod and Branti establish
that patronage does not justify the coercion of a person'spolitical beliefs and associations. Although no opinion in

Elrod commanded a majority of the Court, five Justices
found common ground in the proposition that subjecting a
nonconfidential, nonpolicymaking public employee to penalty
for exercising rights of political association was tantamount
to an unconstitutional condition under Perry v. Sindermann,
supra. See Elrod v. Burns, supra, at 359 (plurality opinion)

("The threat of dismissal for failure to provide [support for
the favored political party] unquestionably inhibits protected
belief and association, and dismissal for failure to provide
support only penalizes its exercise"); 427 U. S., at 375 (Stewart, J., concurring in judgment) ("The single substantive
question involved in this case is whether a nonpolicymaking,
nonconfidential government employee can be discharged or
threatened with discharge from a job that he is satisfactorily
performing upon the sole ground of his political beliefs. I
agree with the plurality that he cannot").

Four Terms later, in Branti v. Finkel, supra, we reaffirmed Elrod's common holding and said government termination of a public employee on account of his political affiliation brings our unconstitutional conditions cases into play,
for "[i]f the First Amendment protects a public employee
from discharge based on what he has said, it must also protect him from discharge based on what he believes," 445
U. S., at 515. We also modified the standard, announced in
the two opinions supporting the Elrod judgment, for assess518US3$88L 05-19-99 16:24:15 PAGES OPINPGT

719Cite as: 518 U. S. 712 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
ing when party affiliation, consistent with the First Amend-ment, may be an acceptable basis for terminating a public

employee: "[T]he ultimate inquiry is not whether the label`policymaker' or `confidential' fits a particular position;
rather, the question is whether the hiring authority can demonstrate that party affiliation is an appropriate requirementfor the effective performance of the public office involved."

445 U. S., at 518.Our cases call for a different, though related, inquiry
where a government employer takes adverse action on ac-count of an employee or service provider's right of free
speech. There, we apply the balancing test from Pickering
v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will
Cty., supra. See generally Board of Comm'rs, Wabaunsee
Cty. v. Umbehr, ante, at 675-678. Elrod and Branti involved instances where the raw test of political affiliation
sufficed to show a constitutional violation, without the necessity of an inquiry more detailed than asking whether the
requirement was appropriate for the employment in question. There is an advantage in so confining the inquiry
where political affiliation alone is concerned, for one's beliefs
and allegiances ought not to be subject to probing or testing
by the government. It is true, on the other hand, as we
stated at the outset of our opinion, supra, at 714, that the
inquiry is whether the affiliation requirement is a reasonable
one, so it is inevitable that some case-by-case adjudication
will be required even where political affiliation is the test the
government has imposed. A reasonableness analysis will
also accommodate those many cases, perhaps including the
one before us, where specific instances of the employee's
speech or expression, which require balancing in the Pickering context, are intermixed with a political affiliation requirement. In those cases, the balancing Pickering mandates will be inevitable. This case-by-case process will
allow the courts to consider the necessity of according to the
government the discretion it requires in the administration

and awarding of contracts over the whole range of publicworks and the delivery of governmental services.

The Court of Appeals, based on its understanding of thepleadings, considered this simply an affiliation case, and held,
based on Circuit precedent, there was no constitutional pro-tection for one who was simply an outside contractor. We
consider the case in those same terms, but we disagree withthe Court of Appeals' conclusion.

III
There is no doubt that if Gratzianna had been a public em-ployee whose job was to perform tow truck operations, the

city could not have discharged him for refusing to contributeto Paxson's campaign or for supporting his opponent. In
Branti, we considered it settled that to fire a public employeeas a penalty for refusing a request for political and financial
support would impose an unconstitutional condition on gov-ernment employment. See 445 U. S., at 516. Respondents
insist the principles of Elrod and Branti have no force here,arguing that an independent contractor's First Amendment
rights, unlike a public employee's, must yield to the govern-ment's asserted countervailing interest in sustaining a patronage system. We cannot accept the proposition, how-ever, that those who perform the government's work outside
the formal employment relationship are subject to what weconclude is the direct and specific abridgment of First
Amendment rights described in this complaint. As re-spondents offer no justification for their actions, save for insisting on their right to condition a continuing relationshipon political fealty, we hold that the complaint states an actionable First Amendment claim.The complaint alleges imposition of a burden on an individual's right of political association, a concerted effort to coerceits relinquishment. O'Hare was not part of a constituency
that must take its chance of being favored or ignored in thelarger political process--for example, by residing or doing

721Cite as: 518 U. S. 712 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
business in a region the government rewards or spurns inthe construction of public works. Gratzianna instead was

targeted with a specific demand for political support. WhenGratzianna refused, the city terminated a relationship that,
based on longstanding practice, he had reason to believe
would continue. We see nothing to distinguish this from thecoercion exercised in our other unconstitutional conditions

cases. See, e. g., Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of
State of N. Y., 385 U. S. 589 (1967) (teaching position conditioned upon nonmembership in "subversive" organizations);
Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593 (1972) (teaching position
conditioned upon not criticizing college administration).
Had Paxson or his backers solicited the contribution as a
quid pro quo for not terminating O'Hare's arrangement with
the city, they might well have violated criminal bribery statutes. Cf. Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, $$ 5/33-1, 5/33-3; ch. 65,

$ 5/4-8-2 (1994). That Paxson may have steered clear of
criminal liability, however, does little to diminish the attempted coercion of Gratzianna's political association, enforced by a tangible punishment. Our cases make clear that
the government may not coerce support in this manner, unless it has some justification beyond dislike of the individual's
political association. See, e. g., Branti v. Finkel, 445 U. S.,
at 516-517.

Respondents say this case is different because it involves
a claim by an independent contractor. We are not persuaded. A rigid rule "giv[ing] the government carte
blanche to terminate independent contractors for exercising
First Amendment rights . . . would leave [those] rights unduly dependent on whether state law labels a government
service provider's contract as a contract of employment or a

Opinion of the Court

Williston on Contracts $ 1012A (3d ed. 1967); 1 Restatementof Agency $$ 2, 220 (1933), and often serves as a line of

demarcation for differential treatment of individuals whootherwise may be situated in similar positions, see,

e. g.,
Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U. S. 730
(1989); Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U. S. 318(1992); 2 Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 409 (1964). We

see no reason, however, why the constitutional claim hereshould turn on the distinction, which is, in the main, a creature of the common law of agency and torts. Recognizingthe distinction in these circumstances would invite manipulation by government, which could avoid constitutional liability
simply by attaching different labels to particular jobs, Board
of Comm'rs, Wabaunsee Cty. v. Umbehr, ante, at 679. The
fact of interference here is not altered by the circumstance
that the victims are not classified as employees.

Our conclusion is in accord with Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414
U. S. 70 (1973), where independent contractor status did not
suffice to allow government to insist upon a waiver of the
Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination.
After reviewing our rulings extending the Fifth Amendment's privilege to government employees, we said that
"[w]e fail to see a difference of constitutional magnitude between the threat of job loss to an employee of the State, and
a threat of loss of contracts to a contractor." Id., at 83.

Some Courts of Appeals, refusing to extend Elrod and
Branti to independent contractors, find "a difference of constitutional magnitude" in the relative degree to which employees and contractors depend on government sources for
their income. See LaFalce v. Houston, 712 F. 2d 292, 294
(CA7 1983) ("An independent contractor would tend we
imagine to feel a somewhat lesser sense of dependency"),
cert. denied, 464 U. S. 1044 (1984); Horn v. Kean, 796 F. 2d,
at 675 (same). Respondents present no convincing data to
support this speculation, however, and we doubt it is true
for many service providers who come under the formal clas518US3$88L 05-19-99 16:24:15 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of the Court
sification of "independent contractor," cf., e. g., Havekost v.
United States Dept. of Navy, 925 F. 2d 316 (CA9 1991)
(worker was licensed grocery bagger at Navy commissary).The only statistics presented to us in the briefs are relevant

to tow truck services, and these data point the other way.
A national association of towing and recovery service opera-tors, appearing as

amicus, estimates that 75 percent of towing companies provide services in connection with govern-ment requests, the referrals generating between 30 and 60

percent of their gross revenues. Brief for Towing & Recov-ery Assn. of America, Inc., as

Amicus Curiae 9. Petitioners, furthermore, allege a loss of substantial income due to
their termination.

Perhaps some contractors are so independent from government support that the threat of losing business would be
ineffective to coerce them to abandon political activities.
The same might be true of certain public employees, however; they, too, might find work elsewhere if they lose their
government jobs. If results were to turn on these sorts
of distinctions, courts would have to inquire into the extent
to which the government dominates various job markets as
employer or as contractor. We have been, and we remain,
unwilling to send courts down that path. See, e. g., Perry
v. Sindermann, supra, at 597-598. Courts are not well
suited to the task of measuring levels of employee dependence, but there is a more fundamental concern. Independent contractors, as well as public employees, are entitled to
protest wrongful government interference with their rights
of speech and association.

Some Courts of Appeals surmise that independent contractors doing business with the government "are political
hermaphrodites," LaFalce v. Houston, supra, at 294, who
find it in their self-interest to stay on good terms with both
major political parties and so are not at great risk of retaliation for political association. The facts here, if the allegations in the complaint are true, indicate this dubious course

Opinion of the Court

of action may not be followed by many small independent
contractors who are either unable or unwilling to maintain
close ties to all the organized political forces in their communities. In all events, even if some independent contractors
adjust to their precarious position by currying favor with
diverse political parties, the question here concerns coercive
government action taken against those who do not. That
some citizens find a way to mitigate governmental overreaching, or refrain from complaining, does not excuse
wrongs done to those who exercise their rights.

Respondents argue that any decision in O'Hare's favor will
lead to numerous lawsuits, which will interfere with the
sound administration of government contracting. We have
little reason to accept the assessment. The amicus brief
filed on behalf of respondents' position represents that in the
six years since our opinion in Rutan v. Republican Party of
Ill., 497 U. S. 62 (1990), which extended Elrod and Branti
to public employment promotion, transfer, recall, and hiring
decisions based on political affiliation, only 18 suits alleging
First Amendment violations in employment decisions have
been filed against Illinois state officials, Brief for Illinois
State Officials as Amicus Curiae 3. Furthermore, we have
found no reported case in the Tenth Circuit involving a First
Amendment patronage claim by an independent contractor
in the six years since its Court of Appeals first recognized
such claims, see Abercrombie v. Catoosa, 896 F. 2d 1228
(1990). We have no reason to believe that governments cannot bear a like burden in defending against suits alleging the
denial of First Amendment freedoms to public contractors,
and we doubt that our decision today will lead to the imposition of a more extensive burden.

Cities and other governmental entities make a wide range
of decisions in the course of contracting for goods and services. The Constitution accords government officials a large
measure of freedom as they exercise the discretion inherent

Opinion of the Court
in making these decisions. Board of Comm'rs, Wabaunsee
Cty. v. Umbehr, ante, at 674. Interests of economy may lead
a governmental entity to retain existing contractors or
terminate them in favor of new ones without the costs and
complexities of competitive bidding. A government official
might offer a satisfactory justification, unrelated to the suppression of speech or associational rights, for either course
of action. The first may allow the government to maintain
stability, reward good performance, deal with known and reliable persons, or ensure the uninterrupted supply of goods
or services; the second may help to stimulate competition,
encourage experimentation with new contractors, or avoid
the appearance of favoritism. These are choices and policy
considerations that ought to remain open to government officials when deciding to contract with some firms and not
others, provided of course the asserted justifications are not
the pretext for some improper practice. In view of the large
number of legitimate reasons why a contracting decision
might be made, fending off baseless First Amendment lawsuits should not consume scarce government resources. If
the government terminates its affiliation with a service
provider for reasons unrelated to political association, Mt.
Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 287 (1977),
as, for example, where the provider is unreliable, or if the
service provider's political "affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance" of the task in question, Branti v. Finkel, 445 U. S., at 518, there will be no First
Amendment violation.

Respondents' theory, in essence, is that no justification is
needed for their actions, since government officials are entitled, in the exercise of their political authority, to sever relations with an outside contractor for any reason including
punishment for political opposition. Government officials
may indeed terminate at-will relationships, unmodified by
any legal constraints, without cause; but it does not follow

that this discretion can be exercised to impose conditions onexpressing, or not expressing, specific political views, see

Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S., at 597.The absolute right to enforce a patronage scheme, insisted
upon by respondents as a means of retaining control overindependent contractors, Brief for Respondents 13, and satisfying government officials' concerns about reliability, Tr. ofOral Arg. 34-39, has not been shown to be a necessary part
of a legitimate political system in all instances. This wasthe determination controlling our decisions in

Elrod, 427U. S., at 365-368, 372-373 (plurality opinion), and Branti,

supra, at 518-520, and we see no basis for rejecting thatreasoning in this context. We decline to draw a line excluding independent contractors from the First Amendment safe-guards of political association afforded to employees.

IV
Upon such further proceedings as are deemed appropriateby the Court of Appeals or the District Court, including upon

motion for summary judgment if there is no genuine issueas to material facts, the courts on remand should decide
whether the case is governed by the Elrod-Branti rule or bythe Pickering rule.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, andthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion. It is so ordered.

Syllabus

DENVER AREA EDUCATIONAL TELECOMMUNICA-TIONS CONSORTIUM, INC.,

et al. v. FEDERALCOMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 95-124. Argued February 21, 1996--Decided June 28, 1996*
These cases involve three sections of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (Act), as implemented by Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) regulations. Both $ 10(a) of the
Act--which applies to "leased access channels" reserved under federal
law for commercial lease by parties unaffiliated with the cable television
system operator--and $ 10(c)--which regulates "public access channels"
required by local governments for public, educational, and governmental
programming--essentially permit the operator to allow or prohibit "programming" that it "reasonably believes . . . depicts sexual . . . activities
or organs in a patently offensive manner." Under $ 10(b), which applies
only to leased access channels, operators are required to segregate
"patently offensive" programming on a single channel, to block that
channel from viewer access, and to unblock it (or later to reblock it)
within 30 days of a subscriber's written request. Between 1984, when
Congress authorized municipalities to require operators to create public
access channels, and the Act's passage, federal law prohibited operators
from exercising any editorial control over the content of programs
broadcast over either type of access channel. Petitioners sought judicial review of $$ 10(a), (b), and (c), and the en banc Court of Appeals
held that all three sections (as implemented) were consistent with the
First Amendment.

Held: The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.
56 F. 3d 105, affirmed in part and reversed in part.

Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Part III, concluding that $ 10(b) violates the First Amendment. That
section's "segregate and block" requirements have obvious speechrestrictive effects for viewers, who cannot watch programs segregated
on the "patently offensive" channel without considerable advance planning or receive just an occasional few such programs, and who may

judge a program's value through the company it keeps or refrain from
subscribing to the segregated channel out of fear that the operator will
disclose its subscriber list. Moreover, $ 10(b) is not appropriately
tailored to achieve its basic, legitimate objective of protecting children from exposure to "patently offensive" materials. Less restrictive
means utilized by Congress elsewhere to protect children from "patently
offensive" sexual material broadcast on cable channels indicate that

$ 10(b) is overly restrictive while its benefits are speculative. These
include some provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which
utilizes blocking without written request, "V-chips," and other significantly less restrictive means, and the "lockbox" requirement that has
been in place since the Cable Act of 1984. Pp. 753-760.

Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Stevens, Justice O'Connor,
and Justice Souter, concluded in Parts I and II that $ 10(a) is consistent with the First Amendment. Pp. 737-753.

(a) Close scrutiny demonstrates that $ 10(a) properly addresses a serious problem without imposing, in light of the relevant competing interests, an unnecessarily great restriction on speech. First, the section
comes accompanied with the extremely important child-protection justification that this Court has often found compelling. See, e. g., Sable
Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 126. Second,

$ 10(a) arises in a very particular context--congressional permission for
cable operators to regulate programming that, but for a previous Act of
Congress, would have had no path of access to cable channels free of an
operator's control. The First Amendment interests involved are therefore complex, and require a balance between those interests served by
the access requirements themselves (increasing the availability of avenues of expression to programmers who otherwise would not have
them), see H. R. Rep. No. 98-934, pp. 31-36, and the disadvantage to
the First Amendment interests of cable operators and other programmers (those to whom the operator would have assigned the channels
devoted to access). See Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512
U. S. 622, 635-637. Third, the problem $ 10(a) addresses is analogous
to the "indecent" radio broadcasts at issue in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726, and the balance Congress struck here is commensurate with the balance the Court approved in that case. Fourth, $ 10(a)'s
permissive nature means that it likely restricts speech less than, not
more than, the ban at issue in Pacifica. The importance of the interest
at stake here--protecting children from exposure to patently offensive
depictions of sex; the accommodation of the interests of programmers
in maintaining access channels and of cable operators in editing the contents of their channels; the similarity of the problem and its solution to
those at issue in Pacifica; and the flexibility inherent in an approach

that permits private cable operators to make editorial decisions, persuasively establishes that $ 10(a) is a sufficiently tailored response to an
extraordinarily important problem involving a complex balance of interests. Sable, supra, at 128, and Turner, supra, at 637-641, distinguished. Pp. 737-748.

(b) Petitioners' reliance on this Court's "public forum" cases is unavailing. It is unnecessary and unwise to decide whether or how to
apply the public forum doctrine to leased access channels. First, it is
not clear whether that doctrine should be imported wholesale into common carriage regulation of such a new and changing area. Second, although limited public forums are permissible, the Court has not yet
determined whether the decision to limit a forum is necessarily subject
to the highest level of scrutiny, and these cases do not require that it do
so now. Finally, and most important, the features that make $ 10(a) an
acceptable constraint on speech also make it an acceptable limitation on
access to the claimed public forum. Pp. 749-750.

(c) Section 10(a)'s definition of the materials it regulates is not impermissibly vague. Because the language used is similar to that adopted
in Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, 24, as a "guidelin[e]" for state
obscenity laws, it would appear to narrow cable operators' programscreening authority to materials that involve the same kind of sexually
explicit materials that would be obscene under Miller, but that might
have "serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value" or nonprurient purposes, ibid. That the definition is not overly broad is further
indicated by this Court's construction of the phrase "patently offensive,"
see Pacifica, supra, at 748, 750, which would narrow the category late
at night when the audience is basically adult, and by the fact that $ 10(a)
permits operators to screen programs only pursuant to a "written
and published policy." The definition's "reasonabl[e] belie[f]" qualifier
seems designed to provide a legal excuse for the operator's honest mistake, and it constrains the operator's discretion as much as it protects
it. Pp. 750-753.

Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Stevens and Justice Souter,
concluded in Part IV that $ 10(c) violates the First Amendment. Section 10(c), although like $ 10(a) a permissive provision, is different from

$ 10(a) for four reasons. First, cable operators have not historically exercised editorial control over public access channels, such that $ 10(c)'s
restriction on programmers' capacity to speak does not effect a countervailing removal of a restriction on cable operators' speech. Second,
programming on those channels is normally subject to complex supervisory systems composed of both public and private elements, and $ 10(c)
is therefore likely less necessary to protect children. Third, the existence of a system that encourages and secures programming that the

Syllabus

community considers valuable strongly suggests that a "cable operator's
veto" is more likely to erroneously exclude borderline programs that
should be broadcast, than to achieve the statute's basic objective of
protecting children. Fourth, the Government has not shown that there
is a significant enough problem of patently offensive broadcasts to
children, over public access channels, that justifies the restriction imposed by $ 10(c). Consequently, $ 10(c) violates the First Amendment.
Pp. 760-766.

Justice Kennedy, joined by Justice Ginsburg, concurred in the
judgment that $ 10(c) is invalid, but for different reasons. Because the
public access channels regulated by $ 10(c) are required by local cable
franchise authorities, those channels are "designated public forums,"
i. e., property that the government has opened for expressive activity
by the public. International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v.
Lee, 505 U. S. 672, 678. Section 10(c) vests the cable operator with a
power under federal law, defined by reference to the content of speech,
to override the franchise agreement and undercut the public forum the
agreement creates. Where the government thus excludes speech from
a public forum on the basis of its content, the Constitution requires
that the regulation be given the most exacting scrutiny. See, e. g., ibid.
Section 10(c) cannot survive strict scrutiny. Although Congress has a
compelling interest in protecting children from indecent speech, see,
e. g., Sable Communications of Colo., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 126,

$ 10(c) is not narrowly tailored to serve that interest, since, among other
things, there is no basis in the record establishing that $ 10(c) is the
least restrictive means to accomplish that purpose. See, e. g., id., at
128-130. The Government's argument for not applying strict scrutiny
here, that indecent cablecasts are subject to the lower standard of review applied in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726, 748, is not
persuasive, since that lower standard does not even apply to infringements on the liberties of cable operators, Turner Broadcasting System,
Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 637-641. There is less cause for a lower
standard when the rights of cable programmers and viewers are at
stake. Pp. 781-783, 791-794, 803-812.

Justice Thomas, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia,
agreed that $ 10(a) is constitutionally permissible. Cable operators are
generally entitled to much the same First Amendment protection as the
print media. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622,
637, 639. Because Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S.
241, and Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Public Util. Comm'n of Cal., 475
U. S. 1, are therefore applicable, see Turner, supra, at 681-682 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), the cable operator's
editorial rights have general primacy under the First Amendment over

the rights of programmers to transmit and of viewers to watch. None
of the petitioners are cable operators; they are all cable viewers or access programmers or their representative organizations. Because the
cable access provisions are part of a scheme that restricts operators'
free speech rights and expands the speaking opportunities of programmers who have no underlying constitutional right to speak through the
cable medium, the programmers cannot challenge the scheme, or a particular part of it, as an abridgment of their "freedom of speech." Sections 10(a) and (c) merely restore part of the editorial discretion an operator would have absent Government regulation. Pp. 812-826.

We conclude that the first provision--which permits theoperator to decide whether or not to broadcast such programs on leased access channels--is consistent with the FirstAmendment. The second provision, which

requires leasedchannel operators to segregate and to block that programming, and the third provision, applicable to public, educa-tional, and governmental channels, violate the First Amendment, for they are not appropriately tailored to achieve thebasic, legitimate objective of protecting children from exposure to "patently offensive" material.

Cable operators typically own a physical cable networkused to convey programming over several dozen cable channels into subscribers' houses. Program sources vary fromchannel to channel. Most channels carry programming

ate) may provide. Other channels may simply retransmitthrough cable the signals of over-the-air broadcast stations.

Ibid. Certain special channels here at issue, called "leasedchannels" and "public, educational, or governmental channels," carry programs provided by those to whom the lawgives special cable system access rights.

A "leased channel" is a channel that federal law requiresa cable system operator to reserve for commercial lease by
unaffiliated third parties. About 10 to 15 percent of a cablesystem's channels would typically fall into this category.
See 47 U. S. C. $ 532(b). "[P]ublic, educational, or govern-mental channels" (which we shall call "public access" channels) are channels that, over the years, local governmentshave required cable system operators to set aside for public,
educational, or governmental purposes as part of the consid-eration an operator gives in return for permission to install
cables under city streets and to use public rights-of-way.See $ 531; see also H. R. Rep. No. 98-934, p. 30 (1984) (authorizing local authorities to require creation of public accesschannels). Between 1984 and 1992, federal law (as had much
pre-1984 state law, in respect to public access channels) pro-hibited cable system operators from exercising

any editorialcontrol over the content of any program broadcast over

either leased or public access channels. See 47 U. S. C.$$ 531(e) (public access), 532(c)(2) (leased access).

In 1992, in an effort to control sexually explicit program-ming conveyed over access channels, Congress enacted the
three provisions before us. The first two provisions relateto leased channels. The first says:

"This subsection shall permit a cable operator to enforceprospectively a written and published policy of prohibiting programming that the cable operator reasonably be-lieves describes or depicts sexual or excretory activities
or organs in a patently offensive manner as measuredby contemporary community standards." 1992 Act,

$ 10(a)(2), 106 Stat. 1486.

Opinion of Breyer, J.
The second provision, applicable only to leased channels,
requires cable operators to segregate and to block similar
programming if they decide to permit, rather than to prohibit, its broadcast. The provision tells the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) to promulgate regulations that will (a) require "programmers to
inform cable operators if the program[ming] would be indecent as defined by Commission regulations"; (b) require
"cable operators to place" such material "on a single channel"; and (c) require "cable operators to block such single
channel unless the subscriber requests access to such channel
in writing." 1992 Act, $ 10(b)(1). The Commission issued
regulations defining the material at issue in terms virtually
identical to those we have already set forth, namely, as descriptions or depictions of "sexual or excretory activities or
organs in a patently offensive manner" as measured by the
cable viewing community. First Report and Order |||| 33-
38, at 1003-1004. The regulations require the cable operators to place this material on a single channel and to block it
(say, by scrambling). They also require the system operator
to provide access to the blocked channel "within 30 days" of
a subscriber's written request for access and to reblock it
within 30 days of a subscriber's request to do so. 47 CFR

$ 76.701(c) (1995).

The third provision is similar to the first provision, but
applies only to public access channels. The relevant statutory section instructs the FCC to promulgate regulations
that will

"enable a cable operator of a cable system to prohibit
the use, on such system, of any channel capacity of any
public, educational, or governmental access facility for
any programming which contains obscene material,
sexually explicit conduct, or material soliciting or promoting unlawful conduct." 1992 Act, $ 10(c), 106 Stat.

CONSORTIUM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion of Breyer, J.

The FCC, carrying out this statutory instruction, promulgated regulations defining "sexually explicit" in language
almost identical to that in the statute's leased channel
provision, namely, as descriptions or depictions of "sexual
or excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive
manner" as measured by the cable viewing community. See
47 CFR $ 76.702 (1995) (incorporating definition from

$ 76.701(g)).

The upshot is, as we said at the beginning, that the federal
law before us (the statute as implemented through regulations) now permits cable operators either to allow or to
forbid the transmission of "patently offensive" sex-related
materials over both leased and public access channels, and
requires those operators, at a minimum, to segregate and to
block transmission of that same material on leased channels.

Petitioners, claiming that the three statutory provisions,
as implemented by the Commission regulations, violate the
First Amendment, sought judicial review of the Commission's First Report and Order and its Second Report and
Order in the United States Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit. A panel of that Circuit agreed with
petitioners that the provisions violated the First Amendment. Alliance for Community Media v. FCC, 10 F. 3d 812
(1993). The entire Court of Appeals, however, heard the
case en banc and reached the opposite conclusion. It held
that all three statutory provisions (as implemented) were
consistent with the First Amendment. Alliance for Community Media v. FCC, 56 F. 3d 105 (1995). Four of the
eleven en banc appeals court judges dissented. Two of the
dissenting judges concluded that all three provisions violated
the First Amendment. Two others thought that either one,
or two, but not all three of the provisions, violated the First
Amendment. We granted certiorari to review the en banc
court's First Amendment determinations.

We turn initially to the provision that permits cable sys-tem operators to prohibit "patently offensive" (or "indecent")

programming transmitted over leased access channels. 1992Act, $ 10(a). The Court of Appeals held that this provision
did not violate the First Amendment because the FirstAmendment prohibits only "Congress" (and, through the
Fourteenth Amendment, a "State"), not private individuals,from "abridging the freedom of speech." Although the
court said that it found no "state action," 56 F. 3d, at 113,it could not have meant that phrase literally, for, of course,
petitioners attack (as "abridg[ing] . . . speech") a congres-sional statute--which, by definition, is an Act of "Congress."
More likely, the court viewed this statute's "permissive" pro-visions as not themselves restricting speech, but, rather, as
simply reaffirming the authority to pick and choose program-ming that a private entity, say, a private broadcaster, would
have had in the absence of intervention by any federal, orlocal, governmental entity.

We recognize that the First Amendment, the terms ofwhich apply to governmental action, ordinarily does not itself throw into constitutional doubt the decisions of privatecitizens to permit, or to restrict, speech--and this is so

ordinarily even where those decisions take place within theframework of a regulatory regime such as broadcasting.

Were that not so, courts might have to face the difficult, andpotentially restrictive, practical task of deciding which,
among any number of private parties involved in providinga program (for example, networks, station owners, program
editors, and program producers), is the "speaker" whose
rights may not be abridged, and who is the speech-restricting "censor." Furthermore, as this Court has held,

the editorial function itself is an aspect of "speech," see
Turner, 512 U. S., at 636, and a court's decision that a private
party, say, the station owner, is a "censor," could itself inter518US3$89Q 05-29-99 19:07:57 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Breyer, J.

fere with that private "censor's" freedom to speak as an edi-tor. Thus, not surprisingly, this Court's First Amendment

broadcasting cases have dealt with governmental efforts to
restrict, not governmental efforts to provide or to maintain,
a broadcaster's freedom to pick and to choose programming.
Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, 412 U. S. 94 (1973) (striking restrictions
on broadcaster's ability to refuse to carry political advertis-ing);

Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367 (1969)
(upholding restrictions on editorial authority); FCC v.
League of Women Voters of Cal., 468 U. S. 364 (1984) (striking restrictions); cf. Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 530 (1980) (striking ban
on political speech by public utility using its billing envelopes
as a broadcast medium); Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp.
v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557 (1980) (striking
restriction on public utility advertising).

Nonetheless, petitioners, while conceding that this is ordinarily so, point to circumstances that, in their view, make the
analogy with private broadcasters inapposite and make these
cases special ones, warranting a different constitutional result. As a practical matter, they say, cable system operators
have considerably more power to "censor" program viewing
than do broadcasters, for individual communities typically
have only one cable system, linking broadcasters and other
program providers with each community's many subscribers.
See Turner, supra, at 633 (only one cable system in most
communities; nationally more than 60% of homes subscribe
to cable, which then becomes the primary or sole source of
video programming in the overwhelming majority of these
homes). Moreover, concern about system operators' exercise of this considerable power originally led government--
local and federal--to insist that operators provide leased and
public access channels free of operator editorial control.
H. R. Rep. No. 98-934, at 30-31. To permit system operators to supervise programming on leased access channels will

Opinion of Breyer, J.
create the very private-censorship risk that this anticensor-ship effort sought to avoid. At the same time, petitioners

add, cable systems have two relevant special characteristics.They are unusually involved with government, for they depend upon government permission and government facilities
(streets, rights-of-way) to string the cable necessary for theirservices. And in respect to leased channels, their speech

interests are relatively weak because they act less like edi-tors, such as newspapers or television broadcasters, than like
common carriers, such as telephone companies.Under these circumstances, petitioners conclude, Congress' "permissive" law, in actuality, will "abridge" their
free speech. And this Court should treat that law as a congressionally imposed, content-based, restriction unredeemed
as a properly tailored effort to serve a "compelling interest."
See Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime
Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 118 (1991); Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 126 (1989). They
further analogize the provisions to constitutionally forbidden
content-based restrictions upon speech taking place in "public forums" such as public streets, parks, or buildings dedicated to open speech and communication. See Cornelius v.
NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 802
(1985); Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460
U. S. 37, 45 (1983); see also H. R. Rep. No. 98-934, supra, at
30 (identifying public access channels as the electronic equivalent of a "speaker's soap box"). And, finally, petitioners
say that the legal standard the law contains (the "patently
offensive" standard) is unconstitutionally vague. See, e. g.,
Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. Dallas, 390 U. S. 676 (1968) (rejecting censorship ordinance as vague, even though it was intended to protect children).

Like petitioners, Justices Kennedy and Thomas would
have us decide these cases simply by transferring and applying literally categorical standards this Court has developed
in other contexts. For Justice Kennedy, leased access

channels are like a common carrier, cablecast is a protectedmedium, strict scrutiny applies, $ 10(a) fails this test, and,

therefore, $ 10(a) is invalid. Post, at 796-801, 805-807. For
Justice Thomas, the case is simple because the cable operator who owns the system over which access channels are
broadcast, like a bookstore owner with respect to what itdisplays on the shelves, has a predominant First Amendment

interest. Post, at 816-817, 822-824. Both categorical ap-proaches suffer from the same flaws: They import law developed in very different contexts into a new and changing en-vironment, and they lack the flexibility necessary to allow
government to respond to very serious practical problems
without sacrificing the free exchange of ideas the First
Amendment is designed to protect.

The history of this Court's First Amendment jurisprudence, however, is one of continual development, as the Constitution's general command that "Congress shall make no
law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press,"
has been applied to new circumstances requiring different
adaptations of prior principles and precedents. The essence
of that protection is that Congress may not regulate speech
except in cases of extraordinary need and with the exercise
of a degree of care that we have not elsewhere required.
See, e. g., Schenck v. United States, 249 U. S. 47, 51-52 (1919);
Abrams v. United States, 250 U. S. 616, 627-628 (1919)
(Holmes, J., dissenting); West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette,
319 U. S. 624, 639 (1943); Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397,
418-420 (1989). At the same time, our cases have not left
Congress or the States powerless to address the most serious problems. See, e. g., Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315
U. S. 568 (1942); Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427
U. S. 50 (1976); FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726
(1978).

Over the years, this Court has restated and refined these
basic First Amendment principles, adopting them more particularly to the balance of competing interests and the special

circumstances of each field of application. See, e. g., New
York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964) (allowing
criticism of public officials to be regulated by civil libel onlyif the plaintiff shows actual malice);

Gertz v. Robert Welch,
Inc., 418 U. S. 323 (1974) (allowing greater regulation of
speech harming individuals who are not public officials, butstill requiring a negligence standard);

Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367 (1969) (employing highly flexiblestandard in response to the scarcity problem unique to overthe-air broadcast); Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U. S. 221, 231-232 (1987) (requiring "compelling
state interest" and a "narrowly drawn" means in context of
differential taxation of media); Sable, supra, at 126, 131
(applying "compelling interest," "least restrictive means,"
and "narrowly tailored" requirements to indecent telephone
communications); Turner, 512 U. S., at 641 (using "heightened scrutiny" to address content-neutral regulations of
cable system broadcasts); Central Hudson Gas & Elec.
Corp., 447 U. S., at 566 (restriction on commercial speech
cannot be "more extensive than is necessary" to serve a
"substantial" government interest).

This tradition teaches that the First Amendment embodies
an overarching commitment to protect speech from government regulation through close judicial scrutiny, thereby enforcing the Constitution's constraints, but without imposing
judicial formulas so rigid that they become a straitjacket
that disables government from responding to serious problems. This Court, in different contexts, has consistently
held that government may directly regulate speech to address extraordinary problems, where its regulations are
appropriately tailored to resolve those problems without
imposing an unnecessarily great restriction on speech.
Justices Kennedy and Thomas would have us further declare which, among the many applications of the general approach that this Court has developed over the years, we are
applying here. But no definitive choice among competing

analogies (broadcast, common carrier, bookstore) allows us
to declare a rigid single standard, good for now and for all
future media and purposes. That is not to say that we reject all the more specific formulations of the standard--they
appropriately cover the vast majority of cases involving government regulation of speech. Rather, aware as we are of
the changes taking place in the law, the technology, and the
industrial structure related to telecommunications, see, e. g.,
Telecommunications Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 56; S. Rep. No.
104-23 (1995); H. R. Rep. No. 104-204 (1995), we believe it
unwise and unnecessary definitively to pick one analogy or
one specific set of words now. See Columbia Broadcasting,
412 U. S., at 102 ("The problems of regulation are rendered
more difficult because the broadcast industry is dynamic in
terms of technological change; solutions adequate a decade
ago are not necessarily so now, and those acceptable today
may well be outmoded 10 years hence"); Pacifica, supra, at
748 ("We have long recognized that each medium of expression presents special First Amendment problems"). We
therefore think it premature to answer the broad questions
that Justices Kennedy and Thomas raise in their efforts
to find a definitive analogy, deciding, for example, the extent
to which private property can be designated a public forum,
compare post, at 791-793, 794 (Kennedy, J., concurring in
part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part),
with post, at 826-829 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in
part and dissenting in part); whether public access channels
are a public forum, post, at 791-792 (opinion of Kennedy, J.);
whether the Government's viewpoint neutral decision to
limit a public forum is subject to the same scrutiny as a selective exclusion from a pre-existing public forum, post, at 799-
803 (opinion of Kennedy, J.); whether exclusion from common carriage must for all purposes be treated like exclusion
from a public forum, post, at 797-798 (opinion of Kennedy,
J.); and whether the interests of the owners of communica518US3$89Q 05-29-99 19:07:57 PAGES OPINPGT

743Cite as: 518 U. S. 727 (1996)
Opinion of Breyer, J.
tions media always subordinate the interests of all other
users of a medium, post, at 816-817 (opinion of Thomas, J.).

Rather than decide these issues, we can decide these cases
more narrowly, by closely scrutinizing $ 10(a) to assure that
it properly addresses an extremely important problem, without imposing, in light of the relevant interests, an unnecessarily great restriction on speech. The importance of the
interest at stake here--protecting children from exposure to
patently offensive depictions of sex; the accommodation of
the interests of programmers in maintaining access channels
and of cable operators in editing the contents of their channels; the similarity of the problem and its solution to those
at issue in Pacifica; and the flexibility inherent in an approach that permits private cable operators to make editorial decisions, lead us to conclude that $ 10(a) is a sufficiently
tailored response to an extraordinarily important problem.

First, the provision before us comes accompanied with an
extremely important justification, one that this Court has
often found compelling--the need to protect children from
exposure to patently offensive sex-related material. Sable
Communications, 492 U. S., at 126; Ginsberg v. New York,
390 U. S. 629, 639-640 (1968); New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S.
747, 756-757 (1982).

Second, the provision arises in a very particular context--
congressional permission for cable operators to regulate programming that, but for a previous Act of Congress, would
have had no path of access to cable channels free of an operator's control. The First Amendment interests involved are
therefore complex, and require a balance between those
interests served by the access requirements themselves (increasing the availability of avenues of expression to programmers who otherwise would not have them), H. R. Rep.
No. 98-934, at 31-36, and the disadvantage to the First
Amendment interests of cable operators and other programmers (those to whom the cable operator would have assigned

744 DENVER AREA ED. TELECOMMUNICATIONS

CONSORTIUM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion of Breyer, J.

the channels devoted to access). See Turner, 512 U. S., at635-637.

Third, the problem Congress addressed here is remarkablysimilar to the problem addressed by the FCC in

Pacifica,
and the balance Congress struck is commensurate with the
balance we approved there. In Pacifica this Court consid-ered a governmental ban of a radio broadcast of "indecent"

materials, defined in part, like the provisions before us, toinclude

" `language that describes, in terms patently offensive as
measured by contemporary community standards for the
broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities and or-gans, at times of the day when there is a reasonable risk

that children may be in the audience.' " 438 U. S., at732 (quoting 56 F. C. C. 2d 94, 98 (1975)).

The Court found this ban constitutionally permissible pri-marily because "broadcasting is uniquely accessible to children" and children were likely listeners to the program thereat issue--an afternoon radio broadcast. 438 U. S., at 749-
750. In addition, the Court wrote, "the broadcast mediahave established a uniquely pervasive presence in the lives
of all Americans," id., at 748, "[p]atently offensive, indecentmaterial . . . confronts the citizen, not only in public, but also
in the privacy of the home," generally without sufficient
prior warning to allow the recipient to avert his or her eyesor ears,

ibid.; and "[a]dults who feel the need may purchase
tapes and records or go to theaters and nightclubs" to hearsimilar performances,

id., at 750, n. 28.
All these factors are present here. Cable television
broadcasting, including access channel broadcasting, is as
"accessible to children" as over-the-air broadcasting, if not
more so. See Heeter, Greenberg, Baldwin, Paugh, Srigley, & Atkin, Parental Influences on Viewing Style, in Cableviewing 140 (C. Heeter & B. Greenberg eds. 1988) (children
spend more time watching television and view more channels

745Cite as: 518 U. S. 727 (1996)
Opinion of Breyer, J.
than do their parents, whether their household subscribes tocable or receives television over the air). Cable television

systems, including access channels, "have established auniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all Americans."
Pacifica, supra, at 748. See Jost, The Future of Television,
4 The CQ Researcher 1131, 1146 (Dec. 23, 1994) (63% ofAmerican homes subscribe to cable); Greenberg, Heeter,

D'Alessio, & Sipes, Cable and Noncable Viewing Style Com-parisons, in Cableviewing,

supra, at 207 (cable households
spend more of their day, on average, watching television, andwill watch more channels, than households without cable

service). "Patently offensive" material from these stations
can "confron[t] the citizen" in the "privacy of the home," Pacifica, supra, at 748, with little or no prior warning. Cableviewing, supra, at 217-218 (while cable subscribers tend to
use guides more than do broadcast viewers, there was no
difference among these groups in the amount of viewing that
was planned, and, in fact, cable subscribers tended to sample
more channels before settling on a program, thereby making
them more, not less, susceptible to random exposure to unwanted materials). There is nothing to stop "adults who
feel the need" from finding similar programming elsewhere,
say, on tape or in theaters. In fact, the power of cable systems to control home program viewing is not absolute.
Over-the-air broadcasting and direct broadcast satellites already provide alternative ways for programmers to reach
the home and are likely to do so to a greater extent in the
near future. See generally Telecommunications Act of 1996,

$ 201, 110 Stat. 107 (advanced television services), $ 205 (direct broadcast satellite), $ 302 (video programming by telephone companies), and $ 304 (availability of navigation devices to enhance multichannel programming); L. Johnson,
Toward Competition in Cable Television (1994).

Fourth, the permissive nature of $ 10(a) means that it
likely restricts speech less than, not more than, the ban at
issue in Pacifica. The provision removes a restriction as to

746 DENVER AREA ED. TELECOMMUNICATIONS

CONSORTIUM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion of Breyer, J.

some speakers--namely, cable operators. See supra, at 743.
Moreover, although the provision does create a risk that a
program will not appear, that risk is not the same as the
certainty that accompanies a governmental ban. In fact, a
glance at the programming that cable operators allow on
their own (nonaccess) channels suggests that this distinction
is not theoretical, but real. See App. 393 (regular channel
broadcast of Playboy and "Real Sex" programming). Finally, the provision's permissive nature brings with it a flexibility that allows cable operators, for example, not to ban
broadcasts, but, say, to rearrange broadcast times, better to
fit the desires of adult audiences while lessening the risks of
harm to children. See First Report and Order || 31, at 1003
(interpreting the Act's provisions to allow cable operators
broad discretion over what to do with offensive materials).
In all these respects, the permissive nature of the approach
taken by Congress renders this measure appropriate as a
means of achieving the underlying purpose of protecting
children.

Of course, cable system operators may not always
rearrange or reschedule patently offensive programming.
Sometimes, as petitioners fear, they may ban the programming instead. But the same may be said of Pacifica's ban.
In practice, the FCC's daytime broadcast ban could have become a total ban, depending upon how private operators
(programmers, station owners, networks) responded to it.
They would have had to decide whether to reschedule the
daytime show for nighttime broadcast in light of comparative
audience demand and a host of other practical factors that
similarly would determine the practical outcomes of the provisions before us. The upshot, in both cases, must be uncertainty as to practical consequences--of the governmental
ban in the one case and of the permission in the other. That
common uncertainty makes it difficult to say the provision
here is, in any respect, more restrictive than the order in

518US3$89Q 05-29-99 19:07:57 PAGES OPINPGT

747Cite as: 518 U. S. 727 (1996)
Opinion of Breyer, J.
Pacifica. At the same time, in the respects we discussed,
the provision is significantly less restrictive.

The existence of this complex balance of interests persuades us that the permissive nature of the provision, coupled with its viewpoint-neutral application, is a constitutionally permissible way to protect children from the type of
sexual material that concerned Congress, while accommodating both the First Amendment interests served by the access
requirements and those served in restoring to cable operators a degree of the editorial control that Congress removed
in 1984.

Our basic disagreement with Justice Kennedy is narrow.
Like him, we believe that we must scrutinize $ 10(a) with the
greatest care. Like Justices Kennedy and Thomas, we
believe that the interest of protecting children that $ 10(a)
purports to serve is compelling. But we part company with
Justice Kennedy on two issues. First, Justice Kennedy's focus on categorical analysis forces him to disregard
the cable system operators' interests. Post, at 805-806.
We, on the other hand, recognize that in the context of cable
broadcast that involves an access requirement (here, its partial removal), and unlike in most cases where we have explicitly required "narrow tailoring," the expressive interests of
cable operators do play a legitimate role. Cf. Turner, 512
U. S., at 636-637. While we cannot agree with Justice
Thomas that everything turns on the rights of the cable
owner, see post, at 823-824, we also cannot agree with Justice Kennedy that we must ignore the expressive interests
of cable operators altogether. Second, Justice Kennedy's
application of a very strict "narrow tailoring" test depends
upon an analogy with a category ("the public forum cases"),
which has been distilled over time from the similarities of
many cases. Rather than seeking an analogy to a category
of cases, however, we have looked to the cases themselves.
And, as we have said, we found that Pacifica provides the

closest ana logy and lends considerable suppor t to our
conclusion.

Petitioners and Justice Kennedy, see post, at 797-798,
803-804, argue that the opposite result is required by two
other cases: Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492
U. S. 115 (1989), a case in which this Court found unconstitutional a statute that banned "indecent" telephone messages,
and Turner, in which this Court stated that cable broadcast
receives full First Amendment protection. See 512 U. S., at
637-641. The ban at issue in Sable, however, was not only
a total governmentally imposed ban on a category of communications, but also involved a communications medium, telephone service, that was significantly less likely to expose
children to the banned material, was less intrusive, and allowed for significantly more control over what comes into
the home than either broadcasting or the cable transmission
system before us. See 492 U. S., at 128. The Court's distinction in Turner, furthermore, between cable and broadcast television, relied on the inapplicability of the spectrum
scarcity problem to cable. See 512 U. S., at 637-641. While
that distinction was relevant in Turner to the justification
for structural regulations at issue there (the "must carry"
rules), it has little to do with a case that involves the effects
of television viewing on children. Those effects are the result of how parents and children view television programming, and how pervasive and intrusive that programming is.
In that respect, cable and broadcast television differ little, if
at all. See supra, at 744-745. Justice Kennedy would
have us decide that all common carriage exclusions are subject to the highest scrutiny, see post, at 796-799, and then
decide these cases on the basis of categories that provide
imprecise analogies rather than on the basis of a more contextual assessment, consistent with our First Amendment
tradition, of assessing whether Congress carefully and appropriately addressed a serious problem.

Petitioners also rely on this Court's "public forum" cases.They point to

Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators'
Assn., 460 U. S., at 45, a case in which this Court said that"public forums" are "places" that the government "has

opened for use by the public as a place for expressive activity," or which "by long tradition . . . have been devotedto assembly and debate."

Ibid. See also Cornelius v.
NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S., at 801(assuming public forums may include "private property

dedicated to public use"). They add that the Governmentcannot "enforce a content-based exclusion" from a public
forum unless "necessary to serve a compelling state interest"
and "narrowly drawn." Perry, supra, at 45. They further
argue that the statute's permissive provisions unjustifiably
exclude material, on the basis of content, from the "public
forum" that the Government has created in the form of access channels. Justice Kennedy adds by analogy that the
decision to exclude certain content from common carriage is
similarly subject to strict scrutiny, and here does not satisfy
that standard of review. See post, at 796-799, 805-807.

For three reasons, however, it is unnecessary, indeed, unwise, for us definitively to decide whether or how to apply
the public forum doctrine to leased access channels. First,
while it may be that content-based exclusions from the right
to use common carriers could violate the First Amendment,
see post, at 796-800 (opinion of Kennedy, J.), it is not at
all clear that the public forum doctrine should be imported
wholesale into the area of common carriage regulation. As
discussed above, we are wary of the notion that a partial
analogy in one context, for which we have developed doctrines, can compel a full range of decisions in such a new and
changing area. See supra, at 739-743. Second, it is plain
from this Court's cases that a public forum "may be created
for a limited purpose." Perry, supra, at 46, n. 7; see also
Cornelius, supra, at 802 ("[T]he government `is not required
to indefinitely retain the open character of the facility' ")

(quoting Perry, supra, at 46). Our cases have not yet deter-mined, however, that government's decision to dedicate a

public forum to one type of content or another is necessarilysubject to the highest level of scrutiny. Must a local government, for example, show a compelling state interest if it
builds a band shell in the park and dedicates it solely to clas-sical music (but not to jazz)? The answer is not obvious.

Cf. Perry, supra, at 46, n. 7. But, at a minimum, these casesdo not require us to answer it. Finally, and most important,
the effects of Congress' decision on the interests of program-mers, viewers, cable operators, and children are the same,
whether we characterize Congress' decision as one that
limits access to a public forum, discriminates in common
carriage, or constrains speech because of its content. If we
consider this particular limitation of indecent television
programming acceptable as a constraint on speech, we must
no less accept the limitation it places on access to the claimed
public forum or on use of a common carrier.

Consequently, if one wishes to view the permissive provisions before us through a "public forum" lens, one should
view those provisions as limiting the otherwise totally open
nature of the forum that leased access channels provide for
communication of other than patently offensive sexual material--taking account of the fact that the limitation was imposed in light of experience gained from maintaining a totally open "forum." One must still ask whether the First
Amendment forbids the limitation. But unless a label alone
were to make a critical First Amendment difference (and we
think here it does not), the features of these cases that we
have already discussed--the Government's interest in protecting children, the "permissive" aspect of the statute, and
the nature of the medium--sufficiently justify the "limitation" on the availability of this forum.

Finally, petitioners argue that the definition of the materials subject to the challenged provisions is too vague, thereby
granting cable system operators too broad a program518US3$89Q 05-29-99 19:07:57 PAGES OPINPGT

screening authority. Cf. Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoff-man Estates, Inc., 455 U. S. 489, 498 (1982) (citing Grayned

v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 108-109 (1972)) (vaguelaws may lead to arbitrary enforcement); Dombrowski v.
Pfister, 380 U. S. 479, 486-487 (1965) (uncertainty may perni-ciously chill speech). That definition, however, uses language similar to language previously used by this Court forroughly similar purposes.

The provisions, as augmented by FCC regulations, permitcable system operators to prohibit

"programming that the cable operator reasonably be-lieves describes or depicts sexual or excretory activities
or organs in a patently offensive manner as measured bycontemporary community standards." 1992 Act, $ 10(a),
106 Stat. 1486.
See also 47 CFR $ 76.702 (1995) (reading approximately thesame definition into $ 10(c)). This language is similar to language adopted by this Court in Miller v. California, 413U. S. 15, 24 (1973), as a "guidelin[e]" for identifying materials
that States may constitutionally regulate as obscene. In
Miller, the Court defined obscene sexual material (materialthat lacks First Amendment protection) in terms of

"(a) whether the average person, applying contemporarycommunity standards would find that the work, taken as
a whole, appeals to the prurient interest . . . ; (b)whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by theapplicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken
as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, orscientific value."

Ibid. (emphasis added; internal quota-tion marks omitted).

The language, while vague, attempts to identify the categoryof materials that Justice Stewart thought could be described
only in terms of "I know it when I see it." Jacobellis v.Ohio, 378 U. S. 184, 197 (1964) (concurring opinion). In

CONSORTIUM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion of Breyer, J.

$ 10(a) and the FCC regulations, without Miller's qualifiers,the language would seem to refer to material that would be

offensive enough to fall within that category but for the factthat the material also has "serious literary, artistic, political
or scientific value" or nonprurient purposes.

This history suggests that the statute's language aims atthe kind of programming to which its sponsors referred--

pictures of oral sex, bestiality, and rape, see 138 Cong. Rec.981, 985 (1992) (statement of Sen. Helms)--and not at scientific or educational programs (at least unless done with ahighly unusual lack of concern for viewer reaction). Moreover, as this Court pointed out in Pacifica, what is "patently
offensive" depends on context (the kind of program on which
it appears), degree (not "an occasional expletive"), and time
of broadcast (a "pig" is offensive in "the parlor" but not the
"barnyard"). 438 U. S., at 748, 750. Programming at 2
o'clock in the morning is seen by a basically adult audience
and the "patently offensive" must be defined with that fact
in mind.

Further, the statute protects against overly broad application of its standards insofar as it permits cable system operators to screen programs only pursuant to a "written and published policy." 1992 Act, $ 10(a), 106 Stat. 1486. A cable
system operator would find it difficult to show that a leased
access program prohibition reflects a rational "policy" if the
operator permits similarly "offensive" programming to run
elsewhere on its system at comparable times or in comparable ways. We concede that the statute's protection against
overly broad application is somewhat diminished by the fact
that it permits a cable operator to ban programming that the
operator "reasonably believes" is patently offensive. Ibid.
(emphasis added). But the "reasonabl[e] belie[f]" qualifier
here, as elsewhere in the law, seems designed not to expand
the category at which the law aims, but, rather, to provide a
legal excuse, for (at least) one honest mistake, from liability
that might otherwise attach. Cf. Waters v. Churchill, 511

U. S. 661, 682 (1994) (Souter, J., concurring) (public employ-er's reasonable belief that employee engaged in unprotected

the statute whose violation precipitated the arrest wasvalid). And the contours of the shield--reasonableness--
constrain the discretion of the cable operator as much as theyprotect it. If, for example, a court had already found substantially similar programming to be beyond the pale of "pat-ently offensive" material, or if a local authority overseeing
the local public, governmental, or educational channels hadindicated that materials of the type that the cable operator
decides to ban were not "patently offensive" in that commu-nity, then the cable operator would be hard pressed to claim
that the exclusion of the material was "reasonable." Weconclude that the statute is not impermissibly vague.

For the reasons discussed, we conclude that $ 10(a) is con-sistent with the First Amendment.

III
The statute's second provision significantly differs fromthe first, for it does not simply permit, but rather requires,

cable system operators to restrict speech--by segregatingand blocking "patently offensive" sex-related material appearing on leased channels (but not on other channels).1992 Act, $ 10(b). In particular, as previously mentioned,
see supra, at 735, this provision and its implementing regula-tions require cable system operators to place "patently
offensive" leased channel programming on a separate chan-nel; to block that channel; to unblock the channel within
30 days of a subscriber's written request for access; and to

754 DENVER AREA ED. TELECOMMUNICATIONS

CONSORTIUM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion of the Court

reblock the channel within 30 days of a subscriber's requestfor reblocking. 1992 Act, $ 10(b); 47 CFR $$ 76.701(b), (c),

(g) (1995). Also, leased channel programmers must notifycable operators of an intended "patently offensive" broadcast up to 30 days before its scheduled broadcast date.

$$ 76.701(d), (g).These requirements have obvious restrictive effects. The

several up-to-30-day delays, along with single channel seg-regation, mean that a subscriber cannot decide to watch a
single program without considerable advance planningand without letting the "patently offensive" channel in its
entirety invade his household for days, perhaps weeks, at
a time. These restrictions will prevent programmers from
broadcasting to viewers who select programs day by day (or,
through "surfing," minute by minute); to viewers who would
like occasionally to watch a few, but not many, of the programs on the "patently offensive" channel; and to viewers
who simply tend to judge a program's value through channel
reputation, i. e., by the company it keeps. Moreover, the
"written notice" requirement will further restrict viewing
by subscribers who fear for their reputations should the operator, advertently or inadvertently, disclose the list of those
who wish to watch the "patently offensive" channel. Cf. Lamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U. S. 301, 307 (1965) (finding unconstitutional a requirement that recipients of Communist literature notify the Post Office that they wish to
receive it). Further, the added costs and burdens that these
requirements impose upon a cable system operator may encourage that operator to ban programming that the operator
would otherwise permit to run, even if only late at night.

The Government argues that, despite these adverse consequences, the "segregate and block" requirements are lawful
because they are "the least restrictive means of realizing" a
" `compelling interest,' " namely, " `protecting the physical
and psychological well-being of minors.' " See Brief for
Federal Respondents 11 (quoting Sable, 492 U. S., at 126).

Opinion of the Court
It adds that, in any event, the First Amendment, as appliedin

Pacifica, "does not require that regulations of indecency
on television be subject to the strictest" First Amendment"standard of review." Brief for Federal Respondents 11.

We agree with the Government that protection of children
is a "compelling interest." See supra, at 743. But we donot agree that the "segregate and block" requirements properly accommodate the speech restrictions they impose andthe legitimate objective they seek to attain. Nor need we
here determine whether, or the extent to which, Pacificadoes, or does not, impose some lesser standard of review
where indecent speech is at issue, compare 438 U. S., at 745-
748 (opinion of Stevens, J.) (indecent materials enjoy lesser
First Amendment protection), with id., at 761-762 (Powell,
J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (refusing
to accept a lesser standard for nonobscene, indecent material). That is because once one examines this governmental
restriction, it becomes apparent that, not only is it not a
"least restrictive alternative" and is not "narrowly tailored"
to meet its legitimate objective, it also seems considerably
"more extensive than necessary." That is to say, it fails to
satisfy this Court's formulations of the First Amendment's
"strictest," as well as its somewhat less "strict," requirements. See, e. g., Sable, 492 U. S., at 126 ("compelling interest" and "least restrictive means" requirements applied to
indecent telephone communications); id., at 131 (requiring
"narrowly tailored" law); Turner, 512 U. S., at 641 (using
"heightened scrutiny" to address content-neutral structural
regulations of cable systems); id., at 662 (quoting " `no
greater than . . . essential' " language from United States v.
O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 377 (1968), as an example of "heightened," less-than-strictest, First Amendment scrutiny); Central Hudson, 447 U. S., at 566 (restriction on commercial
speech cannot be "more extensive than is necessary"); Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U. S. 618, 624 (1995) (restriction must be "narrowly drawn"); id., at 632 (there must be a

Opinion of the Court

"reasonable" "fit" with the objective that legitimates speechrestriction). The provision before us does not reveal the

caution and care that the standards underlying these variousverbal formulas impose upon laws that seek to reconcile the
critically important interest in protecting free speech with
very important, or even compelling, interests that sometimeswarrant restrictions.

Several circumstances lead us to this conclusion. For onething, the law, as recently amended, uses other means to protect children from similar "patently offensive" materialbroadcast on

unleased cable channels, i. e., broadcast over
any of a system's numerous ordinary, or public access, channels. The law, as recently amended, requires cable operators to "scramble or . . . block" such programming on any
(unleased) channel "primarily dedicated to sexually-oriented
programming." Telecommunications Act of 1996, $ 505, 110
Stat. 136 (emphasis added). In addition, cable operators
must honor a subscriber's request to block any, or all, programs on any channel to which he or she does not wish to
subscribe. $ 504, ibid. And manufacturers, in the future,
will have to make television sets with a so-called "V-chip"--
a device that will be able automatically to identify and block
sexually explicit or violent programs. $ 551, id., at 139-142.

Although we cannot, and do not, decide whether the new
provisions are themselves lawful (a matter not before us),
we note that they are significantly less restrictive than the
provision here at issue. They do not force the viewer to
receive (for days or weeks at a time) all "patently offensive"
programming or none; they will not lead the viewer automatically to judge the few by the reputation of the many; and
they will not automatically place the occasional viewer's
name on a special list. They therefore inevitably lead us to
ask why, if they adequately protect children from "patently
offensive" material broadcast on ordinary channels, they
would not offer adequate protection from similar leased
channel broadcasts as well? Alternatively, if these provi518US3$89Q 05-29-99 19:07:57 PAGES OPINPGT

757Cite as: 518 U. S. 727 (1996)
Opinion of the Court
sions do not adequately protect children from "patently of-fensive" material broadcast on ordinary channels, how could

one justify more severe leased channel restrictions when(given ordinary channel programming) they would yield so
little additional protection for children?

The record does not answer these questions. It does notexplain why, under the new Act, blocking alone--without

written access requests--adequately protects children fromexposure to regular sex-dedicated channels, but cannot adequately protect those children from programming on simi-larly sex-dedicated channels that are leased. It does not
explain why a simple subscriber blocking request system,
perhaps a phone-call-based system, would adequately protect
children from "patently offensive" material broadcast on ordinary non-sex-dedicated channels (i. e., almost all channels)
but a far more restrictive segregate/ block/written-access
system is needed to protect children from similar broadcasts
on what (in the absence of the segregation requirement)
would be non-sex-dedicated channels that are leased. Nor
is there any indication Congress thought the new ordinary
channel protections less than adequate.

The answers to the questions are not obvious. We have
no empirical reason to believe, for example, that sexdedicated channels are all (or mostly) leased channels, or that
"patently offensive" programming on non-sex-dedicated
channels is found only (or mostly) on leased channels. To
the contrary, the parties' briefs (and major city television
guides) provide examples of what seems likely to be such
programming broadcast over both kinds of channels.

We recognize, as the Government properly points out, that
Congress need not deal with every problem at once. Cf.
Semler v. Oregon Bd. of Dental Examiners, 294 U. S. 608,
610 (1935) (the legislature need not "strike at all evils at the
same time"); and Congress also must have a degree of leeway
in tailoring means to ends. Columbia Broadcasting, 412
U. S., at 102-103. But in light of the 1996 statute, it seems

518US3$89Q 05-29-99 19:07:57 PAGES OPINPGT
758 DENVER AREA ED. TELECOMMUNICATIONS

CONSORTIUM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion of the Court

fair to say that Congress now has tried to deal with most of
the problem. At this point, we can take Congress' different,
and significantly less restrictive, treatment of a highly similar problem at least as some indication that more restrictive
means are not "essential" (or will not prove very helpful).
Cf. Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 329 (1988) (existence of
a less restrictive statute suggested that a challenged ordinance, aimed at the same problem, was overly restrictive).

The record's description and discussion of a different alternative--the "lockbox"--leads, through a different route, to a
similar conclusion. The Cable Communications Policy Act
of 1984 required cable operators to provide

"upon the request of a subscriber, a device by which the
subscriber can prohibit viewing of a particular cable
service during periods selected by the subscriber." 47
U. S. C. $ 544(d)(2).

This device--the "lockbox"--would help protect children by
permitting their parents to "lock out" those programs or
channels that they did not want their children to see. See
FCC 85-179, || 132, 50 Fed. Reg. 18637, 18655 (1985) ("[T]he
provision for lockboxes largely disposes of issues involving
the Commission's standard for indecency"). The FCC, in
upholding the "segregate and block" provisions, said that
lockboxes protected children (including, say, children with
inattentive parents) less effectively than those provisions.
See First Report and Order |||| 14-15, 8 FCC Rcd, at 1000.
But it is important to understand why that is so.

The Government sets forth the reasons as follows:

"In the case of lockboxes, parents would have to discover that such devices exist; find out that their cable
operators offer them for sale; spend the time and money
to buy one; learn how to program the lockbox to block
undesired programs; and, finally, exercise sufficient
vigilance to ensure that they have, indeed, locked out

Opinion of the Court
whatever indecent programming they do not wish theirchildren to view." Brief for Federal Respondents 37.

We assume the accuracy of this statement. But the reasonsdo not show need for a provision as restrictive as the one
before us. Rather, they suggest a set of provisions verymuch like those that Congress placed in the 1996 Act.

No provision, we concede, short of an absolute ban, canoffer certain protection against assault by a determined
child. We have not, however, generally allowed this factalone to justify " ` "reduc[ing] the adult population . . . to . . .
only what is fit for children." ' " Sable, 492 U. S., at 128(quoting

Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60,73 (1983), in turn quoting Butler v. Michigan, 352 U. S. 380,

383 (1957)); see Sable, supra, at 130, and n. 10. But, leavingthat problem aside, the Government's list of practical difficulties would seem to call, not for "segregate and block" re-quirements, but, rather, for informational requirements, for
a simple coding system, for readily available blocking equip-ment (perhaps accessible by telephone), for imposing cost
burdens upon system operators (who may spread themthrough subscription fees); or perhaps even for a system that
requires lockbox defaults to be set to block certain channels(say, sex-dedicated channels). These kinds of requirements
resemble those that Congress has recently imposed upon allbut leased channels. For that reason, the "lockbox" description and the discussion of its frailties reinforces our conclu-sion that the leased channel provision is overly restrictive
when measured against the benefits it is likely to achieve.(We add that the record's discussion of the "lockbox" does
not explain why the law now treats leased channels morerestrictively than ordinary channels.)

There may, of course, be other explanations. Congressmay simply not have bothered to change the leased channel
provisions when it introduced a new system for other chan-nels. But responses of this sort, like guesses about the comparative seriousness of the problem, are not legally adequate.

Opinion of Breyer, J.

In other cases, where, as here, the record before Congressor before an agency provides no convincing explanation, this

Court has not been willing to stretch the limits of the plausi-ble, to create hypothetical nonobvious explanations in order
to justify laws that impose significant restrictions uponspeech. See,

e. g., Sable, supra, at 130 ("[T]he congressionalrecord presented to us contains no evidence as to how effective or ineffective the FCC's most recent regulations wereor might prove to be"); Simon & Schuster, 502 U. S., at 120;
Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'r ofRevenue, 460 U. S. 575, 585-586 (1983); Arkansas Writers'
Project, 481 U. S., at 231-232.Consequently, we cannot find that the "segregate and
block" restrictions on speech are a narrowly, or reasonably,tailored effort to protect children. Rather, they are overly
restrictive, "sacrific[ing]" important First Amendment inter-ests for too "speculative a gain."

Columbia Broadcasting,412 U. S., at 127; see League of Women Voters, 468 U. S.,

at 397. For that reason they are not consistent with theFirst Amendment.

IV
The statute's third provision, as implemented by FCC reg-ulation, is similar to its first provision, in that it too

permitsa cable operator to prevent transmission of "patently offensive" programming, in this case on public access channels.1992 Act, $ 10(c); 47 CFR $ 76.702 (1995). But there are four
important differences.The first is the historical background. As

Justice Kennedy points out, see post, at 788-790, cable operators havetraditionally agreed to reserve channel capacity for public,

governmental, and educational channels as part of the con-sideration they give municipalities that award them cable
franchises. See H. R. Rep. No. 98-934, at 30. In the termspreferred by

Justice Thomas, see post, at 827-828, the re-quirement to reserve capacity for public access channels is

similar to the reservation of a public easement, or a dedica518US3$89Q 05-29-99 19:07:57 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Breyer, J.
tion of land for streets and parks, as part of a municipality'sapproval of a subdivision of land. Cf.

post, at 793-794 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). Significantly, these are channels overwhich cable operators have not historically exercised editorial control. H. R. Rep. No. 98-934, supra, at 30. Unlike

$ 10(a) therefore, $ 10(c) does not restore to cable operatorseditorial rights that they once had, and the countervailing

First Amendment interest is nonexistent, or at least muchdiminished. See also

post, at 792-793 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).The second difference is the institutional background that

has developed as a result of the historical difference. When
a "leased channel" is made available by the operator to a
private lessee, the lessee has total control of programming
during the leased time slot. See 47 U. S. C. $ 532(c)(2).
Public access channels, on the other hand, are normally subject to complex supervisory systems of various sorts, often
with both public and private elements. See $ 531(b) (franchising authorities "may require rules and procedures for the
use of the [public access] channel capacity"). Municipalities
generally provide in their cable franchising agreements for
an access channel manager, who is most commonly a nonprofit organization, but may also be the municipality, or, in
some instances, the cable system owner. See D. Brenner,
M. Price, & M. Myerson, Cable Television and Other Nonbroadcast Video || 6.04[7] (1993); P. Aufderheide, Public Access Cable Programming, Controversial Speech, and Free
Expression (1992) (hereinafter Aufderheide), reprinted in

see Brenner, Price, & Myerson, supra, || 6.04[3][c]; Aufderheide, App. 59-60--and are commonly subject to supervision
by a local supervisory board. See, e. g., D. C. Code Ann.

$ 43-1829 (1990 and Supp. 1996); Lynchburg City Code $ 12.1-
44(d)(2) (1988).

This system of public, private, and mixed nonprofit elements, through its supervising boards and nonprofit or governmental access managers, can set programming policy and
approve or disapprove particular programming services.
And this system can police that policy by, for example,
requiring indemnification by programmers, certification of
compliance with local standards, time segregation, adult content advisories, or even by prescreening individual programs. See Second Report and Order || 26, 8 FCC Rcd, at
2642 ("[F]rom the comments received, it appears that a number of access organizations already have in place procedures
that require certification statements [of compliance with local
standards], or their equivalent, from access programmers");

Mollberg, Public Access Coordinator, Ft. Wayne, Ind., 3,FCC Record; Comments of Defiance Community Television

3, FCC Record; Comments of Nutmeg Public Access Televi-sion, Inc., 3-4, FCC Record. Whether these locally accountable bodies prescreen programming, promulgate rules for
the use of public access channels, or are merely available torespond when problems arise, the upshot is the same: There

is a locally accountable body capable of addressing the prob-lem, should it arise, of patently offensive programming
broadcast to children, making it unlikely that many childrenwill in fact be exposed to programming considered patently
offensive in that community. See 56 F. 3d, at 127-128; Second Report and Order || 26, 8 FCC Rcd 2642.

Third, the existence of a system aimed at encouraging and
securing programming that the community considers valuable strongly suggests that a "cable operator's veto" is less
likely necessary to achieve the statute's basic objective, protecting children, than a similar veto in the context of leased
channels. Of course, the system of access managers and
supervising boards can make mistakes, which the operator
might in some cases correct with its veto power. Balanced
against this potential benefit, however, is the risk that the
veto itself may be mistaken; and its use, or threatened use,
could prevent the presentation of programming, that, though
borderline, is not "patently offensive" to its targeted audience. See Aufderheide, App. 64-66 (describing the programs that were considered borderline by access managers,
including sex education, health education, broadcasts of politically marginal groups, and various artistic experiments).
And this latter threat must bulk large within a system that
already has publicly accountable systems for maintaining
responsible programs.

Finally, our examination of the legislative history and the
record before us is consistent with what common sense suggests, namely, that the public/nonprofit programming control
systems now in place would normally avoid, minimize, or

eliminate any child-related problems concerning "patently
offensive" programming. We have found anecdotal references to what seem isolated instances of potentially indecent
programming, some of which may well have occurred on
leased, not public access, channels. See 138 Cong. Rec. 984,
990 (1992) (statement of Sen. Wirth) (mentioning "abuses" on
Time Warner's New York City channel); but see Comments
of Manhattan Neighborhood Network, App. 235, 238 (New
York access manager noting that leased, not public access,
channels regularly carry sexually explicit programming in
New York, and that no commercial programs or advertising
are allowed on public access channels); Brief for Time
Warner Cable as Amicus Curiae 2-3 (indicating that relevant "abuses" likely occurred on leased channels). See also
138 Cong. Rec., at 989 (statement of Sen. Fowler) (describing
solicitation of prostitution); id., at 985 (statement of Sen.
Helms) (identifying newspaper headline referring to mayor's
protest of a "strip act"); 56 F. 3d, at 117-118 (recounting comments submitted to the FCC describing three complaints of
offensive programming); Letter from Mayor of Rancho Palos
Verdes, FCC Record; Resolution of San Antonio City Council, No. 92-49-40, FCC Record.

But these few examples do not necessarily indicate a significant nationwide pattern. See 56 F. 3d, at 127-128 (public
access channels "did not pose dangers on the order of magnitude of those identified on leased access channels," and "local
franchising authorities could respond" to such problems "by
issuing `rules and procedures' or other `requirements' ").
The Commission itself did not report any examples of "indecent" programs on public access channels. See Second Report and Order, 8 FCC Rcd, at 2638; see also Comments of

access channels). Moreover, comments submitted to theFCC undermine any suggestion that prior to 1992 there

were significant problems of indecent programming on publicaccess channels. See Agosta 10, 28, FCC Record (surveying
76 public access systems in New York over two years, and
finding "only two examples of controversial programming,and both had been settled by the producers and the access

not a single obscenity violation has ever occurred"); Comments of Defiance Community Television, at 2-3, FCC Record (in eight years of operation, "there has never been a
serious problem with the content of programming on the
channel").

At most, we have found borderline examples as to which
people's judgment may differ, perhaps acceptable in some
communities but not others, of the type that petitioners fear
the law might prohibit. See, e. g., Aufderheide, App. 64-66;
Brief for Petitioners in No. 95-124, p. 7 (describing depiction

of a self-help gynecological examination); Comments of Time
Warner Entertainment Co., App. 252 (describing an Austin,
Tex., program that included "nude scenes from a movie," and
an Indianapolis, Ind., " `safe sex' " program). It is difficult
to see how such borderline examples could show a compelling
need, nationally, to protect children from significantly harmful materials. Compare 138 Cong. Rec., at 985 (statement
of Sen. Helms) ( justifying regulation of leased access channels in terms of programming that depicts "bestiality" and
"rape"). In the absence of a factual basis substantiating the
harm and the efficacy of its proposed cure, we cannot assume
that the harm exists or that the regulation redresses it. See
Turner, 512 U. S., at 664-665.

The upshot, in respect to the public access channels, is a
law that could radically change present programming-related
relationships among local community and nonprofit supervising boards and access managers, which relationships are
established through municipal law, regulation, and contract.
In doing so, it would not significantly restore editorial rights
of cable operators, but would greatly increase the risk that
certain categories of programming (say, borderline offensive
programs) will not appear. At the same time, given present
supervisory mechanisms, the need for this particular provision, aimed directly at public access channels, is not obvious.
Having carefully reviewed the legislative history of the Act,
the proceedings before the FCC, the record below, and the
submissions of the parties and amici here, we conclude that
the Government cannot sustain its burden of showing that

$ 10(c) is necessary to protect children or that it is appropriately tailored to secure that end. See, e. g., Columbia
Broadcasting, 412 U. S., at 127; League of Women Voters,
468 U. S., at 398-399; Sable, 492 U. S., at 126. Consequently,
we find that this third provision violates the First
Amendment.

Finally, we must ask whether $ 10(a) is severable from thetwo other provisions. The question is one of legislative

intent: Would Congress still "have passed" $ 10(a) "hadit known" that the remaining "provision[s were] invalid"?
Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 506 (1985).If so, we need not invalidate all three provisions.

New Yorkv. Ferber, 458 U. S., at 769, n. 24 (citing United States v.

Thirty-seven Photographs, 402 U. S. 363 (1971)).Although the 1992 Act contains no express "severability
clause," we can find the Act's "severability" intention in itsstructure and purpose. It seems fairly obvious Congress
would have intended its permissive "leased access" channelsprovision, $ 10(a), to stand irrespective of $ 10(c)'s legal fate.
That is because the latter provision concerns only public,educational, and governmental channels. Its presence had
little, if any, effect upon "leased access" channels; hence itsabsence in respect to those channels could not make a significant difference.The "segregate and block" requirement's invalidity does
make a difference, however, to the effectiveness of the per-missive "leased access" provision, $ 10(a). Together they
told the cable system operator: "Either ban a `patently offen-sive' program or `segregate and block' it." Without the
"segregate and block" provision, cable operators are affordedbroad discretion over what to do with a patently offensive
program, and because they will no longer bear the costs ofsegregation and blocking if they refuse to ban such programs, cable operators may choose to ban fewer programs.Nonetheless, this difference does not make the two provisions unseverable. Without the "segregate and block" pro-vision, the law simply treats leased channels (in respect to
patently offensive programming) just as it treats all otherchannels. And judging by the absence of similar segregate
and block provisions in the context of these other channels,Congress would probably have thought that $ 10(a), standing

alone, was an effective (though, perhaps, not the most effec-tive) means of pursuing its objective. Moreover, we can find

no reason why, in light of Congress' basic objective (the pro-tection of children), Congress would have preferred no provisions at all to the permissive provision standing by itself.That provision, capable of functioning on its own, still helps
to achieve that basic objective. Consequently, we believethe valid provision is severable from the others.

VI
For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appealsis affirmed insofar as it upheld $ 10(a); the judgment of the

Court of Appeals is reversed insofar as it upheld $ 10(b) and$ 10(c).

It is so ordered.
Justice Stevens, concurring.
The difference between $ 10(a) and $ 10(c) is the differencebetween a permit and a prohibition. The former restores

the freedom of cable operators to reject indecent programs;the latter requires local franchising authorities to reject such
programs. While I join the Court's opinion, I add thesecomments to emphasize the difference between the two provisions and to endorse the analysis in Part III-B of Justice
Kennedy's opinion even though I do not think it necessaryto characterize the public access channels as public fora.

Like Justice Souter, I am convinced that it would be un-wise to take a categorical approach to the resolution of novel
First Amendment questions arising in an industry as dy-namic as this. Cf.

R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 426-427(1992) (
Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).

Federal law requires cable system operators to reserveabout 15 percent of their channels for commercial lease

to unaffiliated programmers. See 47 U. S. C. $ 532(b). On

these channels, federal law generally prohibits the cable op-erator from exercising any control over program content, see

$ 532(c)(2), with one exception: Section 10(a) allows the oper-ator to refuse to air "indecent" programs. In my view, that
exception is permissible.

The Federal Government established the leased access re-quirements to ensure that certain programmers would have

more channels available to them. Section 10(a) is thereforebest understood as a limitation on the amount of speech that
the Federal Government has spared from the censorial con-trol of the cable operator, rather than a direct prohibition
against the communication of speech that, in the absence of
federal intervention, would flow freely.

I do not agree, however, that $ 10(a) established a public
forum. Unlike sidewalks and parks, the Federal Government created leased access channels in the course of its legitimate regulation of the communications industry. In so
doing, it did not establish an entirely open forum, but rather
restricted access to certain speakers, namely, unaffiliated
programmers able to lease the air time. By facilitating certain speech that cable operators would not otherwise carry,
the leased access channels operate like the must-carry rules
that we considered in Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v.
FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 643-646 (1994), without reference to our
public forum precedents.

When the Federal Government opens cable channels that
would otherwise be left entirely in private hands, it deserves
more deference than a rigid application of the public forum
doctrine would allow. At this early stage in the regulation
of this developing industry, Congress should not be put to an
all or nothing-at-all choice in deciding whether to open certain cable channels to programmers who would otherwise
lack the resources to participate in the marketplace of ideas.

Just as Congress may legitimately limit access to these
channels to unaffiliated programmers, I believe it may also
limit, within certain reasonable bounds, the extent of the ac518US3$89I 05-29-99 19:07:57 PAGES OPINPGT

cess that it confers upon those programmers.1 If the Government had a reasonable basis for concluding that there
were already enough classical musical programs or cartoons
being telecast--or, perhaps, even enough political debate--I
would find no First Amendment objection to an open access
requirement that was extended on an impartial basis to all
but those particular subjects. A contrary conclusion would
ill-serve First Amendment values by dissuading the Government from creating access rights altogether.2

Of course, the fact that the Federal Government may be
entitled to some deference in regulating access for cable programmers does not mean that it may evade First Amendment constraints by selectively choosing which speech should
be excepted from private control. If the Government
spared all speech but that communicated by Republicans
from the control of the cable operator, for example, the First
Amendment violation would be plain. See Cornelius v.
NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 806

1 Our precedents recognize that reasonable restraints may be placed on
access to certain well-regulated fora. There is no reason why cable television should be treated differently. See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 829 (1995); id., at 892-895, 899 (Souter,
J., dissenting); see also Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 278 (1981) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment) ("I should think it obvious, for example,
that if two groups of 25 students requested the use of a room at a particular time--one to view Mickey Mouse cartoons and the other to rehearse
an amateur performance of Hamlet--the First Amendment would not
require that the room be reserved for the group that submitted its application first"); Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 394
(1969) (approving access requirement limited to "matters of great public
concern").

2 For purposes of these cases, canons of constitutional avoidance require

us to assume that the Government has the authority to impose leased
access requirements on cable operators. Indeed, no party to this litigation contends to the contrary. Because petitioners' constitutional claim
depends for its success on the constitutionality of the underlying access
rights, they certainly cannot complain if we decide the cases on that
assumption.

(1985). More subtle viewpoint-based limitations on access
also may be prohibited by the First Amendment. See
Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U. S. 546, 564
(1975) (Douglas, J., dissenting in part and concurring in result in part).

Even though it is often difficult to determine whether a
given access restriction impermissibly singles out certain
ideas for repression, in these cases I find no basis for concluding that $ 10(a) is a species of viewpoint discrimination. By
returning control over indecent programming to the cable
operator, $ 10(a) treats indecent programming on access
channels no differently from indecent programming on regular channels. The decision to permit the operator to determine whether to show indecent programming on access
channels therefore cannot be said to reflect a governmental
bias against the indecent programming that appears on access channels in particular.

Nor can it be argued that indecent programming has no
outlet other than leased access channels, and thus that the
exclusion of such speech from special protection is designed
to prohibit its communication altogether. Petitioners impliedly concede this point when they contend that the indecency restrictions are arbitrarily underinclusive because
they do not affect the similarly indecent programming that
appears on regular channels.

Moreover, the criteria $ 10(a) identifies for limiting access
are fully consistent with the Government's contention that
the speech restrictions are not designed to suppress "a certain form of expression that the Government dislikes," post,
at 802 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part), but rather to protect
children from sexually explicit programming on a pervasive
medium. In other cases, we have concluded that such a justification is both viewpoint neutral and legitimate. Sable

FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726 (1978). There isno reason to conclude otherwise here.

Finally, $ 10(a) cannot be assailed on the somewhat broaderground that it nevertheless reduces the programming available to the adult population to what is suitable for children.
Butler v. Michigan, 352 U. S. 380, 383 (1957); post, at 807(

Kennedy, J., concurring in part, concurring in judgment inpart, and dissenting in part). Section 10(a) serves only to

ensure that the newly created access right will not requireoperators to expose children to

more unsuitable communica-tions than would otherwise be the case. It is thus far different in both purpose and effect from the provision at issue in
Butler, which criminalized the sale of certain books. 352U. S., at 381.

In sum, $ 10(a) constitutes a reasonable, viewpoint-neutrallimitation on a federally created access right for certain cable
programmers. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment ofthe Court of Appeals as to this provision.

II
As both Justice Breyer and Justice Kennedy have ex-plained, the public, educational, and governmental access

channels that are regulated by $ 10(c) are not creations of theFederal Government. They owe their existence to contracts
forged between cable operators and local cable franchisingauthorities.

Ante, at 734, 760-762 (opinion of Breyer, J.);post, at 788-790, 791-794 (

Kennedy, J., concurring in part,concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part).

As their name reflects, so-called PEG channels are subjectto a variety of local governmental controls and regulations
that--apart from any federal requirement--may resulteither in a prohibition or a requirement that certain types of
programs be carried. Ante, at 761-763 (opinion of Breyer,

J.) Presumably, as Justice Breyer explains, the local au-thorities seldom permit programming of the type described

by $ 10(c) to air. Ante, at 762-763.

773Cite as: 518 U. S. 727 (1996)
Stevens, J., concurring
What is of critical importance to me, however, is that ifleft to their own devices, those authorities may choose to

carry some programming that the Federal Government hasdecided to restrict. As I read $ 10(c), the federal statute
would disable local governments from making that choice.
It would inject federally authorized private censors into forafrom which they might otherwise be excluded, and it would

therefore limit local fora that might otherwise be open to allconstitutionally protected speech.

3

Section 10(c) operates as a direct restriction on speechthat, in the absence of federal intervention, might flow freely.

The Federal Government is therefore not entitled to thesame leeway that I believe it deserves when it enacts provisions, such as $ 10(a), that define the limits of federally cre-ated access rights. See

supra, at 769-770. The Federal
Government has no more entitlement to restrict the power
of a local authority to disseminate materials on channels of
its own creation, than it has to restrict the power of cable
operators to do so on channels that they own. In this respect, I agree entirely with Justice Kennedy, save for his
designation of these channels as public fora.

That is not to say that the Federal Government may not
impose restrictions on the dissemination of indecent materials on cable television. Although indecent speech is protected by the First Amendment, the Government may have
a compelling interest in protecting children from indecent
speech on such a pervasive medium. Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115 (1989); FCC v.
Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726 (1978). When the Gov3 Although in 1984 Congress essentially barred cable operators from
exercising editorial control over PEG channels, see 47 U. S. C. $ 531(e),

$ 10(c) does not merely restore the status quo ante. Section 10(c) authorizes private operators to exercise editorial discretion over "indecent" programming even if the franchising authority objects. Under the pre-1984
practice, local franchising authorities were free to exclude operators from
exercising any such control on PEG channels.

ernment acts to suppress directly the dissemination of suchspeech, however, it may not rely solely on speculation and

conjecture. See Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v.FCC, 492 U. S., at 129-131.

Justice Breyer persuasively demonstrates that the Gov-ernment has made no effort to identify the harm caused by
permitting local franchising authorities to determine thequantum of so-called "indecent" speech that may be aired in
their communities. Ante, at 763-766. Nor has the Govern-ment attempted to determine whether the intervention of
the discretionary censorial authority of a private cable oper-ator constitutes an appropriately limited means of addressing that harm. Ibid. Given the direct nature of the restric-tion on speech that $ 10(c) imposes, the Government has
failed to carry its burden of justification. Accordingly, Iagree that the judgment of the Court of Appeals with respect to $ 10(c) should be reversed.

Justice Souter, concurring.
Justice Kennedy's separate opinion stresses the worthypoint that First Amendment values generally are well

served by categorizing speech protection according to therespective characters of the expression, its context, and the
restriction at issue. Reviewing speech regulations underfairly strict categorical rules keeps the starch in the standards for those moments when the daily politics cries loudestfor limiting what may be said.

1 Justice Kennedy sees no

warrant in these cases for anything but a categorical andrule-based approach applying a fixed level of scrutiny, the

strictest, to judge the content-based provisions of $$ 10(a),(b), and (c), and he accordingly faults the principal opinion

for declining to decide the precise doctrinal categories thatshould govern the issue at hand. The value of the categorical approach generally to First Amendment security promptsa word to explain why I join the Court's unwillingness to
announce a definitive categorical analysis in these cases.Neither the speech nor the limitation at issue here may be
categorized simply by content. Our prior case most nearlyon point dealt not with a flat restriction covering a separate
category of indecency at the First Amendment's periphery,but with less than a total ban, directed to instances of indecent speech easily available to children through broadcastsreadily received in the household and difficult or impossible
to control without immediate supervision. See FCC v. Pa-cifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726, 747 (1978) (plurality opinion) ("It is a characteristic of speech such as this that bothits capacity to offend and its `social value' . . . vary with the
circumstances").2 It is not surprising that so contextuallycomplex a category was not expressly assigned a standard
level of scrutiny for reviewing the Government's limitationat issue there.

3

Nor does the fact that we deal in these cases with cabletransmission necessarily suggest that a simple category sub2 Our indecency cases since Pacifica have likewise turned as much on
the context or medium of the speech as on its content. See, e. g., Sable
Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 127-128 (1989) (distinguishing Pacifica in part on the ground that the telephonic medium at
issue was less intrusive than broadcast television); Renton v. Playtime
Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41, 47, 54 (1986) (permitting zoning regulation
of adult theaters based on their "secondary effects"); Bethel School Dist.
No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U. S. 675, 685-686 (1986) (upholding restriction on
indecent speech in a public school).

3 Our analysis of another important strand of the present cases, the right

of owners of the means of communication to refuse to serve as conduits for
messages they dislike, has been equally contextual. Compare Red Lion
Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367 (1969) (upholding a right-of-reply
requirement in the broadcasting context), with Miami Herald Publishing

also present in the case of cable television, ante, at 744-745.
It would seem, then, that the appropriate category for cable
indecency should be as contextually detailed as the Pacifica
example, and settling upon a definitive level-of-scrutiny rule
of review for so complex a category would require a subtle
judgment; but there is even more to be considered, enough
more to demand a subtlety tantamount to prescience.

All of the relevant characteristics of cable are presently
in a state of technological and regulatory flux. Recent and
far-reaching legislation not only affects the technical feasibility of parental control over children's access to undesirable material, see, e. g., Telecommunications Act of 1996,

$ 551, 110 Stat. 139-142 (provision for "V-chip" to block sexually explicit or violent programs), but portends fundamental
changes in the competitive structure of the industry and,
therefore, the ability of individual entities to act as bottlenecks to the free flow of information, see Title III, id., at
114-128 (promoting competition in cable services). As cable
and telephone companies begin their competition for control
over the single wire that will carry both their services, we
can hardly settle rules for review of regulation on the assumption that cable will remain a separable and useful category of First Amendment scrutiny. And as broadcast, cable,
and the cybertechnology of the Internet and the World Wide
Web approach the day of using a common receiver, we can

hardly assume that standards for judging the regulation ofone of them will not have immense, but now unknown and

unknowable, effects on the others.4Accordingly, in charting a course that will permit reasonable regulation in light of the values in competition, we haveto accept the likelihood that the media of communication will
become less categorical and more protean. Because we can-not be confident that for purposes of judging speech restrictions it will continue to make sense to distinguish cable fromother technologies, and because we know that changes in
these regulated technologies will enormously alter the struc-ture of regulation itself, we should be shy about saying the
final word today about what will be accepted as reasonabletomorrow. In my own ignorance I have to accept the real
possibility that "if we had to decide today . . . just what theFirst Amendment should mean in cyberspace, . . . we would
get it fundamentally wrong." Lessig, The Path of Cyber-law, 104 Yale L. J. 1743, 1745 (1995).

The upshot of appreciating the fluidity of the subject thatCongress must regulate is simply to accept the fact that not
every nuance of our old standards will necessarily do for thenew technology, and that a proper choice among existing doctrinal categories is not obvious. Rather than definitivelysettling the issue now,

Justice Breyer wisely reasons bydirect analogy rather than by rule, concluding that the

speech and the restriction at issue in these cases may use-fully be measured against the ones at issue in

Pacifica.5 If

that means it will take some time before reaching a final
method of review for cases like these, there may be consolation in recalling that 16 years passed, from Roth v. United
States, 354 U. S. 476 (1957), to Miller v. California, 413 U. S.
15 (1973), before the modern obscenity rule jelled; that it
took over 40 years, from Hague v. Committee for Industrial
Organization, 307 U. S. 496 (1939), to Perry Ed. Assn. v.
Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37 (1983), for the
public forum category to settle out; and that a round halfcentury passed before the clear and present danger of
Schenck v. United States, 249 U. S. 47 (1919), evolved into

the modern incitement rule of Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395
U. S. 444 (1969) (per curiam).

I cannot guess how much time will go by until the technologies of communication before us today have matured and
their relationships become known. But until a category of
indecency can be defined both with reference to the new
technology and with a prospect of durability, the job of the
courts will be just what Justice Breyer does today: recognizing established First Amendment interests through a
close analysis that constrains the Congress, without wholly
incapacitating it in all matters of the significance apparent
here, maintaining the high value of open communication,
measuring the costs of regulation by exact attention to fact,
and compiling a pedigree of experience with the changing
subject. These are familiar judicial responsibilities in times
when we know too little to risk the finality of precision, and
attention to them will probably take us through the communications revolution. Maybe the judicial obligation to shoulder these responsibilities can itself be captured by a much
older rule, familiar to every doctor of medicine: "First, do
no harm."

"once the categories are established . . . the categorical mode leads to
briefs and arguments that concentrate much more on threshold characterization than on comparative analysis").

Justice O'Connor, concurring in part and dissenting inpart.

I agree that $ 10(a) is constitutional and that $ 10(b) is un-constitutional, and I join Parts I, II, III, and V, and the judgment in part. I am not persuaded, however, that the as-serted "important differences" between $$ 10(a) and 10(c),
ante, at 760, are sufficient to justify striking down $ 10(c). Ifind the features shared by $ 10(a), which covers leased access channels, and $ 10(c), which covers public access chan-nels, to be more significant than the differences. For that
reason, I would find that $ 10(c) also withstands constitu-tional scrutiny.

Both $$ 10(a) and 10(c) serve an important governmentalinterest: the well-established compelling interest of protecting children from exposure to indecent material. See SableCommunications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 126
(1989); Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629, 639-640 (1968).Cable television, like broadcast television, is a medium that
is uniquely accessible to children, see ante, at 744-745, and,of course, children have equally easy access to public access
channels as to leased access channels. By permitting a cable
operator to prevent transmission of patently offensive sex-related programming, $$ 10(a) and 10(c) further the interest

of protecting children.Furthermore, both provisions are permissive. Neither
presents an outright ban on a category of speech, such as westruck down in

Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC,
supra. Sections 10(a) and 10(c) leave to the cable operatorthe decision whether to broadcast indecent programming,

and, therefore, are less restrictive than an absolute governmental ban. Certainly $ 10(c) is not more restrictive than$ 10(a) in this regard.

It is also significant that neither $ 10(a) nor $ 10(c) is morerestrictive than the governmental speech restriction we upheld in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726 (1978). Iagree with

take fully to adapt our First Amendment doctrine to the newcontext we confront here. Because we refrain from doing

so, the precedent established by Pacifica offers an importantguide. Section 10(c), no less than $ 10(a), is within the range
of acceptability set by Pacifica. See ante, at 744-747.

The distinctions upon which the Court relies in decidingthat $ 10(c) must fall while $ 10(a) survives are not, in my

view, constitutionally significant. Much emphasis is placedon the differences in the origins of leased access and public
access channels. To be sure, the leased access channels cov-ered by $ 10(a) were a product of the Federal Government,
while the public access channels at issue in $ 10(c) arose aspart of the cable franchises awarded by municipalities, see
ante, at 761-762, but I am not persuaded that the difference
in the origin of the access channels is sufficient to justify
upholding $ 10(a) and striking down $ 10(c). The interest in
protecting children remains the same, whether on a leased
access channel or a public access channel, and allowing the
cable operator the option of prohibiting the transmission of
indecent speech seems a constitutionally permissible means
of addressing that interest. Nor is the fact that public access programming may be subject to supervisory systems in
addition to the cable operator, see ante, at 761-763, sufficient
in my mind to render $ 10(c) so ill tailored to its goal as to
be unconstitutional.

Given the compelling interest served by $ 10(c), its permissive nature, and its fit within our precedent, I would hold

$ 10(c), like $ 10(a), constitutional.

cance; it applies no standard, and by this omission loses sightof existing First Amendment doctrine. When confronted

with a threat to free speech in the context of an emergingtechnology, we ought to have the discipline to analyze the
case by reference to existing elaborations of constant FirstAmendment principles. This is the essence of the case-bycase approach to ensuring protection of speech under theFirst Amendment, even in novel settings. Rather than undertake this task, however, the plurality just declares that,all things considered, $ 10(a) seems fine. I think the implications of our past cases for these cases are clearer than theplurality suggests, and they require us to hold $ 10(a) invalid.

Two provisions of the 1992 Act, $$ 10(a) and (c), authorizethe operator of a cable system to exclude certain programming from two different kinds of channels. Section 10(a)concerns leased access channels. These are channels the
cable operator is required by federal law to make availableto unaffiliated programmers without exercising any control
over program content. The statute allows a cable operatorto enforce a written and published policy of prohibiting on
these channels any programming it "reasonably believes de-scribes or depicts sexual or excretory activities or organs in
a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporarycommunity standards," speech we can refer to as "indecent
programming."Section 10(c) involves public, educational, and governmental access channels (or PEG access channels, as they areknown). These are channels set aside for use by members
of the public, governmental authorities, and local schoolsystems. As interpreted by the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC), $ 10(c) requires the agency to make regu518US3$89L 05-29-99 19:07:57 PAGES OPINPGT

lations enabling cable operators to prohibit indecent pro-gramming on PEG access channels. See ante, at 734-736

(quoting statutory provisions in full and discussing interpre-tive regulations).*

Though the two provisions differ in significant respects,they have common flaws. In both instances, Congress singles out one sort of speech for vulnerability to private cen-sorship in a context where content-based discrimination is
not otherwise permitted. The plurality at least recognizesthis as state action,

ante, at 737, avoiding the mistake madeby the Court of Appeals, Alliance for Community Media v.

FCC, 56 F. 3d 105, 112-121 (CADC 1995). State action liesin the enactment of a statute altering legal relations between
persons, including the selective withdrawal from one groupof legal protections against private acts, regardless of
whether the private acts are attributable to the State. Cf.
Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U. S. 385, 389-390 (1969) (state ac-tion under the Fourteenth Amendment).

The plurality balks at taking the next step, however,which is to advise us what standard it applies to determine
whether the state action conforms to the First Amendment.
Sections 10(a) and (c) disadvantage nonobscene, indecent pro-gramming, a protected category of expression,

not tolerate content-based restriction of, or discriminationagainst, speech.

differ from the provisions here, is not before us.

realm of speech and expression, the First Amendment envisions the citizen shaping the government, not the reverse; it
removes "governmental restraints from the arena of public
discussion, putting the decision as to what views shall be
voiced largely into the hands of each of us, in the hope that
use of such freedom will ultimately produce a more capable
citizenry and more perfect polity." Cohen v. California, 403
U. S. 15, 24 (1971). "[E]ach person should decide for himself
or herself the ideas and beliefs deserving of expression, consideration, and adherence. Our political system and cultural
life rest upon this ideal." Turner Broadcasting System,
Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 641 (1994). We therefore have
given "the most exacting scrutiny to regulations that suppress, disadvantage, or impose differential burdens upon
speech because of its content." Id., at 642.

Sections 10(a) and (c) are unusual. They do not require
direct action against speech, but do authorize a cable operator to deny the use of its property to certain forms of speech.
As a general matter, a private person may exclude certain
speakers from his or her property without violating the First
Amendment, Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U. S. 507 (1976), and if

$$ 10(a) and (c) were no more than affirmations of this principle they might be unremarkable. Access channels, however,
are property of the cable operator, dedicated or otherwise
reserved for programming of other speakers or the government. A public access channel is a public forum, and laws
requiring leased access channels create common-carrier obligations. When the government identifies certain speech
on the basis of its content as vulnerable to exclusion from
a common carrier or public forum, strict scrutiny applies.
These laws cannot survive this exacting review. However
compelling Congress' interest in shielding children from indecent programming, the provisions in these cases are not
drawn with enough care to withstand scrutiny under our
precedents.

Before engaging the complexities of cable access channelsand explaining my reasons for thinking all of $ 10 unconstitutional, I start with the most disturbing aspect of the plural-ity opinion: its evasion of any clear legal standard in deciding
these cases. See ante, at 741 (disavowing need to "declarewhich, among the many applications of the general approach
that this Court has developed over the years, we are apply-ing here").

The plurality begins its flight from standards with a num-ber of assertions nobody disputes. I agree, of course, that
it would be unwise "to declare a rigid single standard, goodfor now and for all future media and purposes," ante, at 742.
I do think it necessary, however, to decide what standard ap-plies to discrimination against indecent programming on cable
access channels in the present state of the industry. We oweat least that much to public and leased access programmers
whose speech is put at risk nationwide by these laws.In a similar vein, we are admonished, these cases are complicated, not simple; the importance of contextual review, weare told, cannot be evaded by recourse to simple analogies.
Ante, at 739-743, 748. All this is true, but use of a standarddoes not foreclose consideration of context. Indeed, if strict
scrutiny is an instance of "judicial formulas so rigid that theybecome a straitjacket that disables government from responding to serious problems," ante, at 741, this is a graveindictment of our First Amendment jurisprudence, which relies on strict scrutiny in a number of settings where contextis important. I have expressed misgivings about judicial
balancing under the First Amendment, see Burson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 211-212 (1992) (concurring opinion);Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime

Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 124-125 (1991) (opinion concur-ring in judgment), but strict scrutiny at least confines the
balancing process in a manner protective of speech; it doesnot disable government from addressing serious problems,

but does ensure that the solutions do not sacrifice speech to
a greater extent than necessary.

The plurality claims its resistance to standards is in keeping with our case law, where we have shown a willingness to
be flexible in confronting novel First Amendment problems.
The cases it cites, ante, at 740-741, however, demonstrate
the opposite of what the plurality supposes: In each, we developed specialized or more or less stringent standards when
certain contexts demanded them; we did not avoid the use of
standards altogether. Indeed, the creation of standards and
adherence to them, even when it means affording protection
to speech unpopular or distasteful, is the central achievement of our First Amendment jurisprudence. Standards
are the means by which we state in advance how to test a
law's validity, rather than letting the height of the bar be
determined by the apparent exigencies of the day. They
also provide notice and fair warning to those who must predict how the courts will respond to attempts to suppress
their speech. Yet formulations like strict scrutiny, used in
a number of constitutional settings to ensure that the inequities of the moment are subordinated to commitments made
for the long run, see Simon & Schuster, supra, at 115-116;
Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S.
37, 45 (1983), mean little if they can be watered down whenever they seem too strong. They mean still less if they can
be ignored altogether when considering a case not on all
fours with what we have seen before.

The plurality seems distracted by the many changes in
technology and competition in the cable industry. See ante,
at 741-742; ante, at 776-777 (Souter, J., concurring). The
laws challenged here, however, do not retool the structure of
the cable industry or (with the exception of $ 10(b)) involve
intricate technologies. The straightforward issue here is
whether the Government can deprive certain speakers, on
the basis of the content of their speech, of protections af518US3$89L 05-29-99 19:07:57 PAGES OPINPGT

forded all others. There is no reason to discard our existingFirst Amendment jurisprudence in answering this question.

While it protests against standards, the plurality doesseem to favor one formulation of the question in these cases:
namely, whether the Act "properly addresses an extremely
important problem, without imposing, in light of the relevantinterests, an unnecessarily great restriction on speech."

Ante, at 743. (Though the plurality frowns on any effort tosettle on a form of words, it likes this formulation well
enough to repeat it; see ante, at 741.) This description ofthe question accomplishes little, save to clutter our First
Amendment case law by adding an untested rule with an
uncertain relationship to the others we use to evaluate laws
restricting speech. The plurality cannot bring itself to
apply strict scrutiny, yet realizes it cannot decide these cases
without uttering some sort of standard; so it has settled for
synonyms. "[C]lose judicial scrutiny," ibid., is substituted
for strict scrutiny, and "extremely important problem," ante,
at 743, or "extraordinary proble[m]," ante, at 741, is substituted for "compelling interest." The admonition that the restriction not be unnecessarily great in light of the interest it
serves, ante, at 743, is substituted for the usual narrow tailoring requirements. All we know about the substitutes is
that they are inferior to their antecedents. We are told the
Act must be "appropriately tailored," ante, at 741, "sufficiently tailored," ante, at 743, or "carefully and appropriately
addressed," ante, at 748, to the problems at hand--anything,
evidently, except narrowly tailored.

These restatements have unfortunate consequences. The
first is to make principles intended to protect speech easy to
manipulate. The words end up being a legalistic cover for
an ad hoc balancing of interests; in this respect the plurality
succeeds after all in avoiding the use of a standard. Second,
the plurality's exercise in pushing around synonyms for the
words of our usual standards will sow confusion in the courts
bound by our precedents. Those courts, and lawyers in the

communications field, now will have to discern what difference there is between the formulation the plurality applies
today and our usual strict scrutiny. I can offer little guidance, except to note the unprotective outcome the plurality
reaches here. This is why comparisons and analogies to
other areas of our First Amendment case law become a responsibility, rather than the luxury the plurality considers
them to be. The comparisons provide discipline to the
Court and guidance for others, and give clear content to our
standards--all the things I find missing in the plurality's
opinion. The novelty and complexity of these cases is a reason to look for help from other areas of our First Amendment
jurisprudence, not a license to wander into uncharted areas
of the law with no compass other than our own opinions
about good policy.

Another troubling aspect of the plurality's approach is its
suggestion that Congress has more leeway than usual to
enact restrictions on speech where emerging technologies
are concerned, because we are unsure what standard should
be used to assess them. Justice Souter recommends to
the Court the precept, " `First, do no harm,' " ante, at 778.
The question, though, is whether the harm is in sustaining
the law or striking it down. If the plurality is concerned
about technology's direction, it ought to begin by allowing
speech, not suppressing it. We have before us an urgent
claim for relief against content-based discrimination, not a
dry run.

I turn now to the issues presented, and explain why strict
scrutiny is warranted.

grams created by the cable operator itself; and access channels (PEG and leased), the two kinds of programming at

on Cable Television's Public Access Channels: The Limits of
Governmental Response, 38 DePaul L. Rev. 1051, 1056-1057
(1989) (hereinafter Mueller). See also Turner Broadcasting, 512 U. S., at 628-629.

PEG access channels grew out of local initiatives in the
late 1960's and early 1970's, before the Federal Government
began regulating cable television. Mueller 1061. Local
franchising was the first form of cable regulation, arising
from the need of localities to control access to public rightsof-way and easements and to minimize disruption to traffic
and other public activity from the laying of cable lines. See
D. Brenner, M. Price, & M. Meyerson, Cable Television and
Other Nonbroadcast Video $ 3.01[3] (1996) (hereinafter Brenner); Turner Broadcasting, supra, at 628 ("[T]he cable medium may depend for its very existence upon express permission from local governing authorities"). A local government
would set up a franchise authority to oversee the cable system and to negotiate a franchise agreement specifying the
cable operator's rights and obligations. See Brenner $ 3.01;

$ 3.01[4] (discussing States where local franchising has now
been displaced by state regulation). Cf. 47 U. S. C. $ 522(10)
(defining franchise authority). A franchise, now mandatory
under federal law except for systems operating without them
prior to 1984, $ 541(b), is an authorization, akin to a license,
by a franchise authority permitting the construction or operation of a cable system. $ 522(8). From the early 1970's onward, franchise authorities began requiring operators to set
aside access channels as a condition of the franchise. See

Community Media et al., filed with the FCC under MM
Docket No. 92-258 (hereinafter FCC Record).

The FCC entered the arena in 1972, requiring the cable
companies servicing the country's largest television markets
to set aside four access channels (one each for public, educational, governmental, and leased programming) by a date
certain, and to add channel capacity if necessary to meet
the requirement. Cable Television Report and Order, 36
F. C. C. 2d 141, 189-198 (1972). See also In re Amendment
of Part 76 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations Concerning the Cable Television Channel Capacity and Access
Channel Requirements of Section 76.251, 59 F. C. C. 2d 294,
303, 321 (1976) (modifying the 1972 rules). We struck down
the access rules as beyond the FCC's authority under the
Communications Act of 1934. FCC v. Midwest Video Corp.,
440 U. S. 689, 708-709 (1979).

When Congress turned its attention to PEG access channels in 1984, it recognized that "reasonable third-party access to cable systems will mean a wide diversity of information sources for the public--the fundamental goal of the First
Amendment--without the need to regulate the content of
programming provided over cable." H. R. Rep. No. 98-934,
p. 30 (1984). It declined, however, to set new federal mandates or authorize the FCC to do so. Since "[a]lmost all recent franchise agreements provide for access by local governments, schools, and non-profit and community groups"
over some channels, the 1984 Act instead "continue[d] the
policy of allowing cities to specify in cable franchises that
channel capacity and other facilities be devoted to such
use." Ibid.

Section 611 of the Communications Act of 1934, added by
the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 (1984 Act), authorized local franchise authorities to require cable operators
to set aside channel capacity for PEG access when seeking
new franchises or renewal of old ones. 47 U. S. C. $ 531(b).

beyond those authorized by federal law, $ 531(a). But cf.$ 557(a) (grandfathering as valid all pre-1984 franchise agreements for the remainder of their term). Federal law also
allows a franchise authority to "require adequate assurancethat the cable operator will provide adequate public, educational, and governmental access channel capacity, facilities,or financial support." $ 541(a)(4)(B). Prior to the passage
of $ 10(c) of the 1992 Act, the cable operator, save for imple-menting provisions of its franchise agreement limiting obscene or otherwise constitutionally unprotected cable programming, $ 544(d), was forbidden any editorial control over
PEG access channels. 47 U. S. C. $ 531(e) (1988 ed.).

Congress has not, in the 1984 Act or since, defined what
public, educational, or governmental access means or placed
substantive limits on the types of programming on those
channels. Those tasks are left to franchise agreements, so
long as the channels comport in some sense with the industry
practice to which Congress referred in the statute.

My principal concern is with public access channels (the P
of PEG). These are the channels open to programming by
members of the public. Petitioners here include public access programmers and viewers who watch their shows. By
contrast, educational and governmental access channels (the
E and G of PEG) serve other speakers. Under many franchises, educational channels are controlled by local school
systems, which use them to provide school information and
educational programs. Governmental access channels are
committed by the cable franchise to the local municipal government, which uses them to distribute information to constituents on public affairs. Mueller 1065-1066. No local
governmental entity or school system has petitioned for relief in these cases, and none of the petitioners who are viewers has asserted an interest in viewing educational or governmental programming or briefed the relevant issues.

The public access channels established by franchise agree-ments tend to have certain traits. They are available at low

or no cost to members of the public, often on a first-come,first-served basis. Brenner $ 6.04[3][a]-[b], at 6-38. The
programmer on one of these channels most often has com-plete control over, as well as liability for, the content of its
show. Ibid.; Mueller 1064. The entity managing the tech-nical aspects of public access, such as scheduling and transmission, is not always the cable operator; it may be the localgovernment or a third party that runs the access centers,
which are facilities made available for the public to produceprograms and transmit them on the access channels. Brenner $ 6.04[7], at 6-48.Public access channels meet the definition of a public
forum. We have recognized two kinds of public fora. Thefirst and most familiar are traditional public fora, like streets,
sidewalks, and parks, which by custom have long been openfor public assembly and discourse.

Perry, 460 U. S., at 45;Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, 307 U. S.

the public." International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness,
Inc. v. Lee, 505 U. S. 672, 678 (1992).Public access channels fall in the second category. Required by the franchise authority as a condition of the fran-chise and open to all comers, they are a designated public
forum of unlimited character. The House Report for the1984 Act is consistent with this view. It characterized public access channels as "the video equivalent of the speaker'ssoap box or the electronic parallel to the printed leaflet.

ketplace of ideas." H. R. Rep. No. 98-934, supra, at 30.Public fora do not have to be physical gathering places,

Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S.819, 830 (1995), nor are they limited to property owned by
the government, Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed.
Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 800 (1985). Indeed, in the major-ity of jurisdictions, title to some of the most traditional of

public fora, streets and sidewalks, remains in private hands.10A E. McQuillin, Law of Municipal Corporations $ 30.32 (3d
ed. 1990); Hague, supra, at 515 ("Wherever the title ofstreets and parks may rest, they have immemorially been
held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind,
have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating
thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions").
Public access channels are analogous; they are public fora
even though they operate over property to which the cable
operator holds title.

It is important to understand that public access channels
are public fora created by local or state governments in the
cable franchise. Section $ 10(c) does not, as the Court of Appeals thought, just return rightful First Amendment discretion to the cable operator, see Alliance for Community
Media, 56 F. 3d, at 114. Cable operators have First Amendment rights, of course; restrictions on entry into the cable
business may be challenged under the First Amendment, Los
Angeles v. Preferred Communications, Inc., 476 U. S. 488,
494 (1986), and a cable operator's activities in originating
programs or exercising editorial discretion over programs
others provide on its system also are protected, Turner
Broadcasting, 512 U. S., at 636. But cf. id., at 656 (distinguishing discretion of cable operators from that of newspaper editors). Yet the editorial discretion of a cable operator
is a function of the cable franchise it receives from local government. The operator's right to exercise any editorial discretion over cable service disappears if its franchise is terminated. See 47 U. S. C. $ 541(b) (cable service may not

be offered without a franchise); $ 546 (prescribing proce-dures and standards for renewal). Cf. Brenner $ 3.07[9][a]

(franchise terms of 15 years are the norm); $ 3.07[15] (typicalfranchise agreements recognize the absolute right of the
franchiser to refuse renewal at expiration of term). If the
franchise is transferred to another, so is the right of editorialdiscretion. The cable operator may own the cables transmitting the signal, but it is the franchise--the agreementbetween the cable operator and the local government--that
allocates some channels to the full discretion of the cableoperator while reserving others for public access.

In providing public access channels under their franchise
agreements, cable operators therefore are not exercising
their own First Amendment rights. They serve as conduits
for the speech of others. Cf. PruneYard Shopping Center
v. Robins, 447 U. S. 74, 87 (1980). Section 10(c) thus restores
no power of editorial discretion over public access channels
that the cable operator once had; the discretion never existed. It vests the cable operator with a power under federal law, defined by reference to the content of speech, to
override the franchise agreement and undercut the public
forum the agreement creates. By enacting a law in 1992
excluding indecent programming from protection but retaining the prohibition on cable operators' editorial control over
all other protected speech, the Federal Government at the
same time ratified the public-forum character of public access
channels but discriminated against certain speech based on
its content.

The plurality refuses to analyze public access channels as
public fora because it is reluctant to decide "the extent to
which private property can be designated a public forum,"
ante, at 742. We need not decide here any broad issue
whether private property can be declared a public forum by
simple governmental decree. That is not what happens in
the creation of public access channels. Rather, in return for
granting cable operators easements to use public rights-of518US3$89L 05-29-99 19:07:57 PAGES OPINPGT

way for their cable lines, local governments have bargainedfor a right to use cable lines for public access channels.

Justice Thomas resists public-forum analysis because he seesno evidence of a "formal easement." Post, at 828. Under

general principles of property law, no particular formalitiesare necessary to create an easement. Easements may be
created by contract. 2 G. Thompson, Commentaries on theModern Law of Real Property $$ 331-332 (1980); 3 H. Tiffany, The Law of Real Property $ 776 (3d ed. 1939). A fran-chise agreement is a contract, and in those agreements the
cable operator surrenders his power to exclude certain pro-grammers from use of his property for specific purposes. A
state court confronted with the issue would likely hold thefranchise agreement to create a right of access equivalent to
an easement in land. So one can even view these cases as alocal government's dedication of its own property interest to
speech by members of the public. In any event, it seems tome clear that when a local government contracts to use private property for public expressive activity, it creates a pub-lic forum.

Treating access channels as public fora does not just placea label on them, as the plurality suggests, see

ante, at 750.It defines the First Amendment rights of speakers seeking

to use the channels. When property has been dedicated topublic expressive activities, by tradition or government designation, access is protected by the First Amendment. Reg-ulations of speech content in a designated public forum,
whether of limited or unlimited character, are "subject tothe highest scrutiny" and "survive only if they are narrowly
drawn to achieve a compelling state interest." Lee, 505U. S., at 678. Unless there are reasons for applying a lesser
standard, $ 10(c) must satisfy this stringent review.

affiliated programmers who pay to transmit shows of theirown without the cable operator's creative assistance or editorial approval. In my view, strict scrutiny also applies to$ 10(a)'s authorization to cable operators to exclude indecent
programming from these channels.

Congress created leased access channels in the 1984 Act.Section 612 of the Act, as amended, requires a cable system with more than 36 channels to set aside a certain per-centage of its channels (up to 15%, depending on the size
of the system) "for commercial use by persons unaffiliatedwith the operator." 47 U. S. C. $ 532(b)(1). Commercial use
means "provision of video programming, whether or not
for profit." $ 532(b)(5). When an unaffiliated programmer
seeks access, the cable operator shall set "the price, terms,
and conditions of such use which are at least sufficient to
assure that such use will not adversely affect the operation,
financial condition, or market development of the cable system," $ 532(c)(1). Cf. 47 CFR $ 76.971 (1995) (rules governing terms and conditions of leased access). The price may
not exceed the maximum charged any unaffiliated programmer in the same program category for the use of nonaccess
channels. $ 76.970. Aggrieved programmers have recourse
to federal district court and the FCC (if there are repeated
violations) to compel access on appropriate terms. 47
U. S. C. $$ 532(d), (e).

Before 1992, cable operators were forbidden editorial control over any video programming on leased access channels,
and could not consider the content of the programming except to set the price of access, 47 U. S. C. $ 532(c)(2) (1988
ed.). But cf. 47 U. S. C. $ 532(h) (prohibiting programs that
are obscene or otherwise unprotected under the Constitution
on leased access channels). Section 10(a) of the 1992 Act
modifies the no-discretion rule by allowing cable operators
to reject, pursuant to a written and published policy, programs they reasonably believe to be indecent. $ 532(h).
Under $ 10(b) of the Act, any indecent programming must be

segregated onto one channel and blocked unless the subscriber requests that the channel be provided to him.

$ 532( j); 47 CFR $ 76.701 (1995).

Two distinctions between public and leased access channels are important. First, whereas public access channels
are required by state and local franchise authorities (subject
to certain federal limitations), leased access channels are
created by federal law. Second, whereas cable operators
never have had editorial discretion over public access channels under their franchise agreements, the leased access provisions of the 1984 Act take away channels the operator once
controlled. Cf. Midwest Video, 440 U. S., at 708, n. 17 (federal mandates "compelling cable operators indiscriminately
to accept access programming will interfere with their determinations regarding the total service offering to be extended
to subscribers"). In this sense, $ 10(a) now gives back to the
operator some of the discretion it had before Congress imposed leased access requirements in the first place.

The constitutionality under Turner Broadcasting, 512
U. S., at 665-668, of requiring a cable operator to set aside
leased access channels is not before us. For purposes of
these cases, we should treat the cable operator's rights in
these channels as extinguished, and address the issue these
petitioners present: namely, whether the Government can
discriminate on the basis of content in affording protection
to certain programmers. I cannot agree with Justice
Thomas, post, at 821-822, that the cable operator's rights
inform this analysis.

Laws requiring cable operators to provide leased access
are the practical equivalent of making them common carriers, analogous in this respect to telephone companies: They
are obliged to provide a conduit for the speech of others.
The plurality resists any classification of leased access channels (as created in the 1984 Act) as a common-carrier provision, ante, at 739-740, although we described in just those

terms the access (including leased access) rules promulgatedby the FCC in 1976:

"The access rules plainly impose common-carrier obli-gations on cable operators. Under the rules, cable systems are required to hold out dedicated channels on afirst-come, nondiscriminatory basis. Operators are prohibited from determining or influencing the content ofaccess programming. And the rules delimit what operators may charge for access and use of equipment."
Midwest Video, 440 U. S., at 701-702 (citations and footnotes omitted).

Indeed, we struck down the FCC's rules as beyond the
agency's statutory authority at the time precisely becausethey made cable operators common carriers.

Id., at 702-
709. The FCC characterizes $ 612 as a form of commoncarrier requirement, App. to Pet. for Cert. 139a-140a, asdoes the Government, Brief for Federal Respondents 23.

Section 10(a) authorizes cable operators to ban indecentprogramming on leased access channels. We have held that
a law precluding a common carrier from transmitting protected speech is subject to strict scrutiny, Sable Communications, 492 U. S., at 131 (striking down ban on indecent telephonic communications), but we have not had occasion to
consider the standard for reviewing a law, such as $ 10(a),
permitting a carrier in its discretion to exclude specified
speech.

Laws removing common-carriage protection from a single
form of speech based on its content should be reviewed under
the same standard as content-based restrictions on speech in
a public forum. Making a cable operator a common carrier
does not create a public forum in the sense of taking property from private control and dedicating it to public use;
rather, regulations of a common carrier dictate the manner
in which private control is exercised. A common-carriage

mandate, nonetheless, serves the same function as a publicforum. It ensures open, nondiscriminatory access to the

means of communication. This purpose is evident in thestatute itself and in the committee findings supporting it.
Congress described the leased access requirements as in-tended "to promote competition in the delivery of diverse
sources of video programming and to assure that the widestpossible diversity of information sources are made available
to the public from cable systems in a manner consistent withgrowth and development of cable systems." 47 U. S. C.

$ 532(a). The House Committee reporting the 1984 cablebill acknowledged that, in general, market demand would
prompt cable operators to provide diverse programming. Itrecognized, though, the incentives cable operators might
have to exclude "programming which represents a social orpolitical viewpoint that a cable operator does not wish to
disseminate, or . . . competes with a program service alreadybeing provided by that cable system." H. R. Rep. No. 98-
934, at 48. In its view, the leased access provisions werenarrowly drawn structural regulations of private industry,
cf. Associated Press v. United States, 326 U. S. 1 (1945), toenhance the free flow and diversity of information available
to the public without governmental intrusion into decisionsabout program content. H. R. Rep. No. 98-934,

supra, at32-35. The functional equivalence of designating a public

forum and mandating common carriage suggests the samescrutiny should be applied to attempts in either setting to
impose content discrimination by law. Under our prece-dents, the scrutiny is strict.

"The Constitution forbids a State to enforce certain ex-clusions from a forum generally open to the public even
if it was not required to create the forum in the firstplace.

ern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U. S. 546 (1975)(municipal theater). Although a State is not required

to indefinitely retain the open character of the facility,as long as it does so it is bound by the same standards
as apply in a traditional public forum. Reasonable time,place, and manner regulations are permissible, and a
content-based prohibition must be narrowly drawn to ef-fectuate a compelling state interest."

Perry, 460 U. S.,at 45-46 (footnote omitted).

In Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92 (1972),we made clear that selective exclusions from a public forum
were unconstitutional. Invoking the First and FourteenthAmendments to strike down a city ordinance allowing only
labor picketing on any public way near schools, we held the"government may not grant the use of a forum to people
whose views it finds acceptable, but deny use to those wish-ing to express less favored or more controversial views."
Id., at 96.

"Once a forum is opened up to assembly or speaking bysome groups, government may not prohibit others from

assembling or speaking on the basis of what they intendto say. Selective exclusions from a public forum may
not be based on content alone, and may not be justifiedby reference to content alone." Ibid.

Since the same standard applies to exclusions from limitedor unlimited designated public fora as from traditional
forums, Lee, 505 U. S., at 678, there is no reason the kind ofselective exclusion we condemned in Mosley should be tolerated here.The plurality acknowledges content-based exclusions from
the right to use a common carrier could violate the FirstAmendment. It tells us, however, that it is wary of analogies to doctrines developed elsewhere, and so does not ad-dress this issue.

Ante, at 749. This newfound aversion toanalogical reasoning strikes at a process basic to legal analy518US3$89L 05-29-99 19:07:57 PAGES OPINPGT

sis. See E. Levi, An Introduction to Legal Reasoning 1-2(1949). I am not suggesting the plurality should look far

afield to other areas of law; these are settled First Amend-ment doctrines dealing with state action depriving certain
speakers of protections afforded to all others.

In all events, the plurality's unwillingness to consider ourpublic-forum precedents does not relieve it of the burden of

explaining why strict scrutiny should not apply. Except ininstances involving well-settled categories of proscribable
speech, see R. A. V., 505 U. S., at 382-390, strict scrutiny isthe baseline rule for reviewing any content-based discrimination against speech. The purpose of forum analysis is to
determine whether, because of the property or medium
where speech takes place, there should be any dispensation
from this rule. See Consolidated Edison Co. of N. Y. v. Public Service Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 530, 538-539 (1980).
In the context of government property, we have recognized
an exception "[w]here the government is acting as a proprietor, managing its internal operations, rather than acting as
lawmaker with the power to regulate or license," and in
those circumstances, we have said, regulations of speech
need only be reasonable and viewpoint neutral. Lee, supra,
at 678-679. Here, of course, the Government has not dedicated the cable operator's property for leased access to serve
some proprietary function of its own; it has done so to provide a forum for a vital class of programmers who otherwise
would be excluded from cable television.

The question remains whether a dispensation from strict
scrutiny might be appropriate because $ 10(a) restores in
part an editorial discretion once exercised by the cable operator over speech occurring on its property. This is where
public-forum doctrine gives guidance. Common-carrier requirements of leased access are little different in function
from designated public fora, and no different standard of
review should apply. It is not that the functional equivalence of leased access channels to designated public fora

compels strict scrutiny; rather, it simply militates againstrecognizing an exception to the normal rule.

Perhaps, as the plurality suggests, ante, at 749-750, $ 10(a)should be treated as a limitation on a forum rather than an
exclusion from it. This would not change the analysis, however. If Government has a freer hand to draw content-based distinctions in limiting a forum than in excluding

someone from it, the First Amendment would be a deadletter in designated public fora; every exclusion could be
recast as a limitation. See Post, Between Governance andManagement: the History and Theory of the Public Forum,
34 UCLA L. Rev. 1713, 1753 (1987). We have allowed
content-based limitations of public fora, but only when necessary to serve specific institutional ends. See Perry, 460
U. S., at 48 (school mailboxes, if considered designated public
fora, could be limited to mailings from "organizations that
engage in activities of interest and educational relevance to
students"); Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 267-268, n. 5
(1981) (recognizing a public university could limit the use of
its facilities by reasonable regulations compatible with its
mission of education); Madison Joint School Dist. No. 8 v.
Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm'n, 429 U. S. 167,
175, n. 8 (1976) (in assessing a teacher's right to speak at a
school board meeting, considering it obvious that "public
bodies may confine their meetings to specified subject matter"). The power to limit or redefine fora for a specific legitimate purpose, see Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 829-830, does
not allow the government to exclude certain speech or speakers from them for any reason at all.

Madison Joint School Dist., supra, illustrates the point.
The Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission had ordered a school board to prohibit school employees other than
union representatives from speaking at its meetings on matters subject to collective bargaining between the board and
the union. Id., at 173. While recognizing the power of a
State to limit school board meetings to certain subject mat518US3$89L 05-29-99 19:07:57 PAGES OPINPGT

ter, we held it could not confine the forum "to one categoryof interested individuals."

Id., at 175. The exclusion would
skew the debate and deprive decisionmakers of the benefitof other voices.

Id., at 175-176.
It is no answer to say Congress does not have to create
access channels at all, so it may limit access as it pleases.Whether or not a government has any obligation to make

railroads common carriers, under the Equal ProtectionClause it could not define common carriage in ways that discriminate against suspect classes. See Bailey v. Patterson,369 U. S. 31, 33 (1962)

(per curiam) (States may not require
railroads to segregate the races). For the same reason, even
if Congress has no obligation to impose common-carriage
rules on cable operators or retain them forever, it is not at
liberty to exclude certain forms of speech from their protection on the suspect basis of content. See Perry, supra, at
45-46.

I do not foreclose the possibility that the Government
could create a forum limited to certain topics or to serving
the special needs of certain speakers or audiences without
its actions being subject to strict scrutiny. This possibility
seems to trouble the plurality, which wonders if a local government must "show a compelling state interest if it builds
a band shell in the park and dedicates it solely to classical
music (but not to jazz)." Ante, at 750. This is not the correct analogy. These cases are more akin to the Government's creation of a band shell in which all types of music
might be performed except for rap music. The provisions
here are content-based discriminations in the strong sense of
suppressing a certain form of expression that the Government dislikes or otherwise wishes to exclude on account of
its effects, and there is no justification for anything but strict
scrutiny here.

Giving government free rein to exclude speech it dislikes
by delimiting public fora (or common-carriage provisions)
would have pernicious effects in the modern age. Minds are

not changed in streets and parks as they once were. To anincreasing degree, the more significant interchanges of ideas

and shaping of public consciousness occur in mass and elec-tronic media. Cf. United States v. Kokinda, 497 U. S. 720,
737 (1990) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). The ex-tent of public entitlement to participate in those means of
communication may be changed as technologies change; andin expanding those entitlements the Government has no
greater right to discriminate on suspect grounds than it doeswhen it effects a ban on speech against the backdrop of the
entitlements to which we have been more accustomed. Itcontravenes the First Amendment to give Government a
general license to single out some categories of speech forlesser protection so long as it stops short of viewpoint
discrimination. D

The Government advances a different argument for notapplying strict scrutiny in these cases. The nature of access
channels to one side, it argues the nature of the speech inquestion--indecent broadcast (or cablecast)--is subject to
the lower standard of review it contends was applied in FCCv. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U. S. 726, 748 (1978) (upholding
an FCC order declaring the radio broadcast of indecentspeech during daytime hours to be sanctionable).

Pacifica did not purport, however, to apply a special stand-ard for indecent broadcasting. Emphasizing the narrowness
of its holding, the Court in Pacifica conducted a context-specific analysis of the FCC's restriction on indecent programming during daytime hours. See id., at 750. See also
Sable Communications, 492 U. S., at 127-128 (underscoringthe narrowness of

Pacifica). It relied on the general rulethat "broadcasting . . . has received the most limited First

Amendment protection." 438 U. S., at 748. We alreadyhave rejected the application of this lower broadcast standard of review to infringements on the liberties of cable opera-tors, even though they control an important communica518US3$89L 05-29-99 19:07:57 PAGES OPINPGT

tions medium. Turner Broadcasting, 512 U. S., at 637-641.There is even less cause for a lower standard here.

Pacifica did identify two important considerations rele-vant to the broadcast of objectionable material. First, indecent broadcasting "confronts the citizen, not only in public,
but also in the privacy of the home, where the individual'sright to be left alone plainly outweighs the First Amendment

rights of an intruder." 438 U. S., at 748. Second, "broad-casting is uniquely accessible to children, even those too
young to read." Id., at 749. Pacifica teaches that accesschannels, even if analogous to ordinary public fora from the
standpoint of the programmer, must also be considered from
the standpoint of the viewer. An access channel is not a
forum confined to a discrete public space; it can bring indecent expression into the home of every cable subscriber,
where children spend astounding amounts of time watching
television, cf. ante, at 744-745 (citing studies). Though in
Cohen we explained that people in public areas may have to
avert their eyes from messages that offend them, 403 U. S.,
at 21, we further acknowledged that "government may properly act in many situations to prohibit intrusion into the privacy of the home of unwelcome views and ideas which cannot
be totally banned from the public dialogue," ibid. See Hess
v. Indiana, 414 U. S. 105, 108 (1973) (per curiam); Rowan v.
Post Office Dept., 397 U. S. 728, 736-738 (1970). This is more
true when the interests of children are at stake. See id., at
738 ("[T]he householder [should not] have to risk that offensive material come into the hands of his children before it
can be stopped").

These concerns are weighty and will be relevant to
whether the law passes strict scrutiny. They do not justify,
however, a blanket rule of lesser protection for indecent
speech. Other than the few categories of expression that
can be proscribed, see R. A. V., 505 U. S., at 382-390, we
have been reluctant to mark off new categories of speech for
diminished constitutional protection. Our hesitancy reflects

skepticism about the possibility of courts drawing principleddistinctions to use in judging governmental restrictions on

speech and ideas, Cohen, 403 U. S., at 25, a concern height-ened here by the inextricability of indecency from expression. "[W]e cannot indulge the facile assumption that onecan forbid particular words without also running a substantial risk of suppressing ideas in the process." Id., at 26.The same is true of forbidding programs indecent in some
respect. In artistic or political settings, indecency may havestrong communicative content, protesting conventional
norms or giving an edge to a work by conveying "otherwiseinexpressible emotions."

Ibid. In scientific programs, themore graphic the depiction (even if to the point of offensiveness), the more accurate and comprehensive the portrayal ofthe truth may be. Indecency often is inseparable from the
ideas and viewpoints conveyed, or separable only with lossof truth or expressive power. Under our traditional First
Amendment jurisprudence, factors perhaps justifying somerestriction on indecent cable programming may all be taken
into account without derogating this category of protectedspeech as marginal.

IV
At a minimum, the proper standard for reviewing $$ 10(a)and (c) is strict scrutiny. The plurality gives no reason why

it should be otherwise. I would hold these enactments un-constitutional because they are not narrowly tailored to
serve a compelling interest.The Government has no compelling interest in restoring a
cable operator's First Amendment right of editorial discre-tion. As to $ 10(c), Congress has no interest at all, since
under most franchises operators had no rights of editorialdiscretion over PEG access channels in the first place. As
to $ 10(a), any governmental interest in restoring operatordiscretion over indecent programming on leased access channels is too minimal to justify the law. First, the transmis-sion of indecent programming over leased access channels

Opinion of Kennedy, J.

is not forced speech of the operator. Turner Broadcasting,
supra, at 655-656; PruneYard, 447 U. S., at 87. Second, the
discretion conferred by the law is slight. The operator is
not authorized to place programs of its own liking on the
leased access channels, nor to remove other speech (racist or
violent, for example) that might be offensive to it or to viewers. The operator is just given a veto over the one kind of
lawful speech Congress disdains.

Congress does have, however, a compelling interest in protecting children from indecent speech. Sable Communications, 492 U. S., at 126; Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629,
639-640 (1968). See also Pacifica, 438 U. S., at 749-750
(same). So long as society gives proper respect to parental
choices, it may, under an appropriate standard, intervene to
spare children exposure to material not suitable for minors.
This interest is substantial enough to justify some regulation
of indecent speech even under, I will assume, the indecency
standard used here.

Sections 10(a) and (c) nonetheless are not narrowly tailored
to protect children from indecent programs on access channels. First, to the extent some operators may allow indecent programming, children in localities those operators
serve will be left unprotected. Partial service of a compelling interest is not narrow tailoring. FCC v. League of
Women Voters of Cal., 468 U. S. 364, 396 (1984) (asserted
interest in keeping noncommercial stations free from controversial or partisan opinions not served by ban on station
editorials, if such opinions could be aired through other programming); Florida Star v. B. J. F., 491 U. S. 524, 540-541
(1989) (selective ban on publication of rape victim's name
in some media but not others not narrowly tailored). Cf.
Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 73
(1983) (restriction that "provides only the most limited incremental support for the interest asserted" cannot pass muster
under commercial-speech standards). Put another way, the

807Cite as: 518 U. S. 727 (1996)
Opinion of Kennedy, J.
interest in protecting children from indecency only at the
caprice of the cable operator is not compelling. Perhaps
Congress drafted the law this way to avoid the clear constitutional difficulties of banning indecent speech from access
channels, but the First Amendment does not permit this sort
of ill fit between a law restricting speech and the interest it
is said to serve.

Second, to the extent cable operators prohibit indecent
programming on access channels, not only children but adults
will be deprived of it. The Government may not "reduce
the adult population . . . to [viewing] only what is fit for
children." Butler v. Michigan, 352 U. S. 380, 383 (1957). It
matters not that indecent programming might be available
on the operator's other channels. The Government has no
legitimate interest in making access channels pristine. A
block-and-segregate requirement similar to $ 10(b), but without its constitutional infirmity of requiring persons to place
themselves on a list to receive programming, see ante, at
756-757, protects children with far less intrusion on the liberties of programmers and adult viewers than allowing cable
operators to ban indecent programming from access channels
altogether. When applying strict scrutiny, we will not assume plausible alternatives will fail to protect compelling interests; there must be some basis in the record, in legislative
findings or otherwise, establishing the law enacted as the
least restrictive means. Sable Communications, supra, at
128-130. Cf. Turner Broadcasting, 512 U. S., at 664-668.
There is none here.

Sections 10(a) and (c) present a classic case of discrimination against speech based on its content. There are legitimate reasons why the Government might wish to regulate
or even restrict the speech at issue here, but $$ 10(a) and (c)
are not drawn to address those reasons with the precision
the First Amendment requires.

V
Not only does the plurality fail to apply strict scrutiny, but
its reasoning is unpersuasive on its own terms.

The plurality declares $ 10(c) unconstitutional because it
interferes with local supervisory systems that "can set programming policy and approve or disapprove particular programming services." Ante, at 762. Replacing these local
schemes with a cable operator veto would, in the plurality's
view, "greatly increase the risk that certain categories of
programming (say, borderline offensive programs) will not
appear," ante, at 766. Although the plurality terms these
local schemes "public/nonprofit programming control systems," ante, at 763, it does not contend (nor does the record
suggest) that any local board or access center has the authority to exclude indecent programming, or to do anything that
would cast doubt on the status of public access channels
as public fora. Cf. Agosta 88 (New York state law forbids
editorial control over public access programs by either the
cable operator or the municipality); Comments of Hillsborough County Board of County Commissioners 2, FCC
Record (explaining county's inability to exclude indecent programming). Indeed, "[m]ost access centers surveyed do not
prescreen at all, except, as in [two named localities], a high
speed run-through for technical quality." P. Aufderheide,
Public Access Cable Programming, Controversial Speech,
and Free Expression (1992), reprinted in App. 61, 68. As
the plurality acknowledges, the record indicates no response
to indecent programming by local access centers (whether
they prescreen or not) other than "requiring indemnification
by programmers, certification of compliance with local standards, time segregation, [and] adult content advisories," ante,
at 762. Those are measures that, if challenged, would likely
survive strict scrutiny as narrowly tailored to safeguard
children. If those measures, in the words of the plurality,
"normally avoid, minimize, or eliminate any child-related

problems concerning `patently offensive' programming" onpublic access channels,

ante, at 763-764, one is left to wonder
why the cable operator veto over leased access programmingauthorized in $ 10(a) is constitutional even under the plurality's First Amendment analysis. Although I concur in its
judgment that $ 10(c) is invalid, I cannot agree with the plu-rality's reasoning.

In regard to $ 10(a), the plurality's analysis there under-mines its claims of faithfulness to our First Amendment
jurisprudence and close attention to context.First, the plurality places some weight on there being
"nothing to stop `adults who feel the need' from finding [indecent] programming elsewhere, say, on tape or in theaters,"
or on competitive services like direct broadcast television,
ante, at 745. The availability of alternative channels of communication may be relevant when we are assessing contentneutral time, place, and manner restrictions, Ward v. Rock
Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 791, 802 (1989), but the fact
that speech can occur elsewhere cannot justify a contentbased restriction, Southeastern Promotions, 420 U. S., at
556; Schneider v. State (Town of Irvington), 308 U. S. 147,
163 (1939).

Second, the plurality suggests the permissive nature of

$ 10(a) at least does not create the same risk of exclusion as
a total ban on indecency. Ante, at 745-746. This states the
obvious, but the possibility the Government could have imposed more draconian limitations on speech never has justified a lesser abridgment. Indeed, such an argument almost
always is available; few of our First Amendment cases involve outright bans on speech. See, e. g., Forsyth County v.
Nationalist Movement, 505 U. S. 123, 130-137 (1992) (broad
discretion of county administrator to award parade permits
and to adjust permit fee according to content of speech violates First Amendment); Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan,
372 U. S. 58 (1963) (informal threats to recommend criminal prosecutions and other pressure tactics by state moral518US3$89L 05-29-99 19:07:57 PAGES OPINPGT

ity commission against book publishers violate the FirstAmendment).

Third, based on its own factual speculations, the pluralitydiscounts the risks created by the law that operators will not
run indecent programming on access channels. The plural-ity takes "a glance at the programming that cable operators
allow on their own (nonaccess) channels," and, espying someindecent programming there, supposes some cable operators
may be willing to allow similar programs on leased accesschannels.

Ante, at 746. This sort of surmise, giving theGovernment the benefit of the doubt when it restricts

speech, is an unusual approach to the First Amendment, toput it mildly. Worse, it ignores evidence of industry structure that should cast doubt on the plurality's sanguine viewof the probable fate of programming considered "indecent"
under $ 10(a). The plurality fails to note that, aside fromthe indecency provisions of $ 10 tacked on in a Senate floor
amendment, the 1992 Act strengthened the regulation ofleased access channels because it was feared cable operators
would exercise their substantial market power to excludedisfavored programmers. The congressional findings in the
statute and the conclusions of the Senate Committee onCommerce, Science, and Transportation after more than two
years of hearings on the cable market, see S. Rep. No. 102-92, pp. 3-4 (1991), are instructive. Leased access channels
had been underused since their inception in 1984, the SenateCommittee determined.

Id., at 30. Though it recognizedthe adverse economics of leased access for programmers may

have been one reason for the underutilization, the Commit-tee found the obstinacy of cable operators and their control
over prices, terms, and conditions also were to blame. Id.,at 31.

"The cable operator is almost certain to have intereststhat clash with that of the programmer seeking to use
leased access channels. If their interests were similar,the operator would have been more than willing to carry

the programmer on regular cable channels. The opera-tor thus has already decided for any number of reasons

not to carry the programmer. For example, the opera-tor may believe that the programmer might compete
with programming that the [operator] owns or controls.To permit the operator to establish the leased access
rate thus makes little sense." Ibid.
Perhaps some operators will choose to show the indecentprogramming they now may banish if they can command a

better price than other access programmers are willing topay. In the main, however, leased access programs are the
ones the cable operator, for competitive reasons or other-wise, has no interest in showing. And because the cable operator may put to his own commercial use any leased accesscapacity not taken by unaffiliated programmers, 47 U. S. C.

$ 532(b)(4), operators have little incentive to allow indecentprogramming if they have excess capacity on leased access
channels.There is even less reason to think cable operators will
choose to show indecent programs on public access channels.The operator is not paid, or paid much, for transmitting programs on these channels; public access programs may com-pete with the operator's own programs; the operator will
wish to avoid unwanted controversy; and here, as with leasedaccess channels, the operator may reclaim unused PEG capacity for its own paid use, 47 U. S. C. $ 531(d)(1).In the 1992 Act, Congress recognized cable operators
might want to exclude unaffiliated or otherwise disfavoredprogrammers from their channels, but it granted operators
discretion to do so in regard to but a single category ofspeech. The obvious consequence invited by the discretion
is exclusion. I am not sure why the plurality would supposeotherwise, or contend the practical consequences of $ 10(a)
would be no worse for programmers than those flowing fromthe sort of time-segregation requirement approved in

Pa-cifica. See ante, at 746-747. Despite its claim of making

"a more contextual assessment" of these cases, ante, at 748,the plurality ignores a key difference of these cases from

Pacifica. There, the broadcaster wanted to air the speechin question; here, the cable operator does not. So the safe
harbor of late-night programming permitted by the FCC in
Pacifica would likely promote speech, whereas suppressionwill follow from $ 10(a).

VI
In agreement with the plurality's analysis of $ 10(b) of theAct, insofar as it applies strict scrutiny, I join Part III of its

opinion. Its position there, however, cannot be reconciledwith upholding $ 10(a). In the plurality's view, $ 10(b), which
standing alone would guarantee an indecent programmersome access to a cable audience, violates the First Amendment, but $ 10(a), which authorizes exclusion of indecent pro-gramming from access channels altogether, does not. There
is little to commend this logic or result. I dissent from thejudgment of the Court insofar as it upholds the constitutionality of $ 10(a).

Justice Thomas, joined by The Chief Justice and
Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment in part anddissenting in part.

I agree with the principal opinion's conclusion that $ 10(a)is constitutionally permissible, but I disagree with its conclusion that $$ 10(b) and (c) violate the First Amendment. Formany years, we have failed to articulate how, and to what
extent, the First Amendment protects cable operators, pro-grammers, and viewers from state and federal regulation. I
think it is time we did so, and I cannot go along with Justice
Breyer's assiduous attempts to avoid addressing thatissue openly.

I
The text of the First Amendment makes no distinctionsamong print, broadcast, and cable media, but we have done

so. In Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367

Opinion of Thomas, J.
(1969), we held that, in light of the scarcity of broadcastingfrequencies, the Government may require a broadcast licensee "to share his frequency with others and to conducthimself as a proxy or fiduciary with obligations to present
those views and voices which are representative of his com-munity and which would otherwise, by necessity, be barred
from the airwaves." Id., at 389. We thus endowed the pub-lic with a right of access "to social, political, esthetic, moral,
and other ideas and experiences." Id., at 390. That publicright left broadcasters with substantial, but not complete,
First Amendment protection of their editorial discretion.See,

e. g., Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee, 412 U. S. 94, 117-118 (1973) ("Abroadcast licensee has a large measure of journalistic freedom but not as large as that exercised by a newspaper").In contrast, we have not permitted that level of government interference in the context of the print media. InMiami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241
(1974), for instance, we invalidated a Florida statute that re-quired newspapers to allow, free of charge, a right of reply
to political candidates whose personal or professional charac-ter the paper assailed. We rejected the claim that the statute was constitutional because it fostered speech rather thanrestricted it, as well as a related claim that the newspaper
could permissibly be made to serve as a public forum. Id.,at 256-258. We also flatly rejected the argument that the
newspaper's alleged media monopoly could justify forcingthe paper to speak in contravention of its own editorial discretion. Id., at 256.Our First Amendment distinctions between media, dubious from their infancy,1 placed cable in a doctrinal wastelandin which regulators and cable operators alike could not be
sure whether cable was entitled to the substantial FirstAmendment protections afforded the print media or was

subject to the more onerous obligations shouldered by the
broadcast media. See Los Angeles v. Preferred Communications, Inc., 476 U. S. 488, 496 (1986) (Blackmun, J., concurring) ("In assessing First Amendment claims concerning
cable access, the Court must determine whether the characteristics of cable television make it sufficiently analogous to
another medium to warrant application of an already existing
standard or whether those characteristics require a new
analysis"). Over time, however, we have drawn closer to
recognizing that cable operators should enjoy the same First
Amendment rights as the nonbroadcast media.

Our first ventures into the world of cable regulation involved no claims arising under the First Amendment, and
we addressed only the regulatory authority of the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) over cable operators.2
Only in later cases did we begin to address the level of First
Amendment protection applicable to cable operators. In
Preferred Communications, for instance, when a cable operator challenged the city of Los Angeles' auction process for
a single cable franchise, we held that the cable operator had
stated a First Amendment claim upon which relief could be
granted. Id., at 493. We noted that cable operators communicate various topics "through original programming or
by exercising editorial discretion over which stations or programs to include in [their] repertoire." Id., at 494. Cf.
FCC v. Midwest Video Corp., 440 U. S. 689, 707 (1979) (Midwest Video II) ("Cable operators now share with broadcasters a significant amount of editorial discretion regarding
what their programming will include"). But we then lik2 See United States v. Southwestern Cable Co., 392 U. S. 157 (1968);
United States v. Midwest Video Corp., 406 U. S. 649 (1972) (Midwest Video
I). Our decisions in Southwestern Cable and Midwest Video I were
purely regulatory and gave no indication whether, or to what extent, cable
operators were protected by the First Amendment.

ened the operators' First Amendment interests to those of
broadcasters subject to Red Lion's right of access requirement. 476 U. S., at 494-495.

Five years later, in Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U. S. 439
(1991), we dropped any reference to the relaxed scrutiny
permitted by Red Lion. Arkansas had subjected cable
operators to the State's general sales tax, while continuing
to exempt newspapers, magazines, and scrambled satellite
broadcast television. Cable operators, among others, challenged the tax on First Amendment grounds, arguing that
the State could not discriminatorily apply the tax to some,
but not all, members of the press. Though we ultimately
upheld the tax scheme because it was not content based, we
agreed with the operators that they enjoyed the protection
of the First Amendment. We found that cable operators
engage in speech by providing news, information, and entertainment to their subscribers and that they are "part
of the `press.' " 499 U. S., at 444.

Two Terms ago, in Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v.
FCC, 512 U. S. 622 (1994), we stated expressly what we had
implied in Leathers: The Red Lion standard does not apply
to cable television. 512 U. S., at 637 ("[T]he rationale for
applying a less rigorous standard of First Amendment scrutiny to broadcast regulation . . . does not apply in the context
of cable regulation"); id., at 639 ("[A]pplication of the more
relaxed standard of scrutiny adopted in Red Lion and the
other broadcast cases is inapt when determining the First
Amendment validity of cable regulation"). While Members
of the Court disagreed about whether the must-carry rules
imposed by Congress were content based, and therefore subject to strict scrutiny, there was agreement that cable operators are generally entitled to much the same First Amendment protection as the print media. But see id., at 670
(Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)
("Cable operators' control of essential facilities provides a

basis for intrusive regulation that would be inappropriate
and perhaps impermissible for other communicative media").

In Turner, by adopting much of the print paradigm, and
by rejecting Red Lion, we adopted with it a considerable
body of precedent that governs the respective First Amendment rights of competing speakers. In Red Lion, we had
legitimized consideration of the public interest and emphasized the rights of viewers, at least in the abstract. Under
that view, "[i]t is the right of the viewers and listeners, not
the right of the broadcasters, which is paramount." 395
U. S., at 390. After Turner, however, that view can no
longer be given any credence in the cable context. It is the
operator's right that is preeminent. If Tornillo and Pacific
Gas & Elec. Co. v. Public Util. Comm'n of Cal., 475 U. S. 1
(1986), are applicable, and I think they are, see Turner,
supra, at 681-682 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), then, when there is a conflict, a programmer's asserted right to transmit over an operator's cable system must give way to the operator's editorial discretion.
Drawing an analogy to the print media, for example, the author of a book is protected in writing the book, but has no
right to have the book sold in a particular bookstore without
the store owner's consent. Nor can government force the
editor of a collection of essays to print other essays on the
same subject.

The Court in Turner found that the FCC's must-carry
rules implicated the First Amendment rights of both cable
operators and cable programmers. The rules interfered
with the operators' editorial discretion by forcing them to
carry broadcast programming that they might not otherwise
carry, and they interfered with the programmers' ability to
compete for space on the operators' channels. 512 U. S., at
636-637; id., at 675-676 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part
and dissenting in part). We implicitly recognized in Turner
that the programmer's right to compete for channel space

817Cite as: 518 U. S. 727 (1996)
Opinion of Thomas, J.
is derivative of, and subordinate to, the operator's editorial
discretion. Like a freelance writer seeking a paper in which
to publish newspaper editorials, a programmer is protected
in searching for an outlet for cable programming, but has no
freestanding First Amendment right to have that programming transmitted. Cf. Miami Herald Publishing Co. v.
Tornillo, 418 U. S., at 256-258. Likewise, the rights of
would-be viewers are derivative of the speech rights of operators and programmers. Cf. Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v.
Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748,
756-757 (1976) ("Freedom of speech presupposes a willing
speaker. But where a speaker exists, . . . the protection
afforded is to the communication, to its source and to its recipients both"). Viewers have a general right to see what a
willing operator transmits, but, under Tornillo and Pacific
Gas, they certainly have no right to force an unwilling operator to speak.

By recognizing the general primacy of the cable operator's
editorial rights over the rights of programmers and viewers,
Turner raises serious questions about the merits of petitioners' claims. None of the petitioners in these cases are cable
operators; they are all cable viewers or access programmers
or their representative organizations. See Brief for Petitioners in No. 95-124, pp. 5-6; Brief for Petitioners New
York Citizens Committee for Responsible Media et al. in No.
95-227, p. 3; Brief for Petitioners Alliance for Community
Media et al. in No. 95-227, p. 3. It is not intuitively obvious
that the First Amendment protects the interests petitioners
assert, and neither petitioners nor the plurality have adequately explained the source or justification of those asserted rights.

Justice Breyer's detailed explanation of why he believes
it is "unwise and unnecessary," ante, at 742, to choose a
standard against which to measure petitioners' First Amendment claims largely disregards our recent attempt in Turner

to define that standard.3 His attempt to distinguish Turneron the ground that it did not involve "the effects of television

viewing on children," ante, at 748, is meaningless becausethat factual distinction has no bearing on the existence and
ordering of the free speech rights asserted in these cases.In the process of deciding not to decide on a governing
standard, Justice Breyer purports to discover in our casesan expansive, general principle permitting government to
"directly regulate speech to address extraordinary problems,where its regulations are appropriately tailored to resolve
those problems without imposing an unnecessarily great re-striction on speech."

Ante, at 741. This heretofore un-known standard is facially subjective and openly invites balancing of asserted speech interests to a degree not ordinarilypermitted. It is true that the standard I endorse lacks the
"flexibility" inherent in the plurality's balancing approach,
ante, at 740, but that relative rigidity is required by ourprecedents and is not of my own making.

In any event, even if the plurality's balancing test were anappropriate standard, it could only be applied to protect
speech interests that, under the circumstances, are them-selves protected by the First Amendment. But, by shifting
the focus to the balancing of "complex" interests, ante, at743,

Justice Breyer never explains whether (and if so,how) a programmer's ordinarily unprotected interest in affirmative transmission of its programming acquires constitu-tional significance on leased and public access channels. See

3 Curiously, the plurality relies on "changes taking place in the law, the
technology, and the industrial structure related to telecommunications,"
ante, at 742, to justify its avoidance of traditional First Amendment standards. If anything, as the plurality recognizes, ante, at 745, those recent
developments--which include the growth of satellite broadcast programming and the coming influx of video dialtone services--suggest that local
cable operators have little or no monopoly power and create no programming bottleneck problems, thus effectively negating the primary justifications for treating cable operators differently from other First Amendment speakers.

to 15 percent of their available channels for commercial leaseto "unaffiliated persons." Operators were prohibited from
"exercis[ing] any editorial control" over these leased accesschannels. $ 532(c)(2). In 1992, Congress withdrew part of
its prohibition on the exercise of the cable operators' edito-rial control and essentially permitted operators to censor privately programming that the "operator reasonably believesdescribes or depicts sexual or excretory activities or organs
in a patently offensive manner." $ 532(h).Since 1984, federal law has also permitted local franchise
authorities to require cable operators to set aside certainchannels for "public, educational, or governmental use" (PEG
channels),4 $ 531(a), but unlike the leased access provisions,has not directly required operators to do so. As with leased
access, Congress generally prohibited cable operators fromexercising "any editorial control" over public access channels, but provided that operators could prohibit the transmis-sion of obscene programming. $ 531(e); see $ 544(d). Section 10(c) of the 1992 Act broadened the operators' editorialcontrol and instructed the FCC to promulgate regulations
enabling a cable operator to ban from its public access chan-nels "any programming which contains obscene material,
sexually explicit conduct, or material soliciting or promotingunlawful conduct." Note following 47 U. S. C. $ 531. The

CONSORTIUM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion of Thomas, J.

FCC subsequently promulgated regulations in its SecondReport and Order, In re Implementation of Section 10 of the

Cable Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992:Indecent Programming and Other Types of Materials on
Cable Access Channels, 8 FCC Rcd 2638 (1993) (Second Re-port and Order). The FCC interpreted Congress' reference
to "sexually explicit conduct" to mean that the programmingmust be indecent, and its regulations therefore permit cable
operators to ban indecent programming from their public ac-cess channels.

Id., at 2640.As I read these provisions, they provide leased and public

access programmers with an expansive and federally en-forced statutory right to transmit virtually any programming over access channels, limited only by the bounds ofdecency. It is no doubt true that once programmers have
been given, rightly or wrongly, the ability to speak on accesschannels, the First Amendment continues to protect programmers from certain Government intrusions. Certainly,under our current jurisprudence, Congress could not impose
a total ban on the transmission of indecent programming.See Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S.
115, 127 (1989) (striking down total ban on indecent dial-a-porn messages). At the same time, however, the Court has
not recognized, as entitled to full constitutional protection,statutorily created speech rights that directly conflict with
the constitutionally protected private speech rights of an-other person or entity.

5 We have not found a First Amendment violation in statutory schemes that substantially ex-pand the speech opportunities of the person or entity

challenging the scheme.There is no getting around the fact that leased and public
access are a type of forced speech. Though the constitution-ality of leased and public access channels is not directly at

issue in these cases,6 the position adopted by the Court in
Turner ineluctably leads to the conclusion that the federal
access requirements are subject to some form of heightened
scrutiny. See Turner, 512 U. S., at 661-662 (citing Ward v.
Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781 (1989); United States v.
O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968)). Under that view, contentneutral governmental impositions on an operator's editorial
discretion may be sustained only if they further an important
governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free
speech and are no greater than is essential to further the
asserted interest. See id., at 377. Of course, the analysis
I joined in Turner would have required strict scrutiny. 512

U. S., at 680-682 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).

Petitioners must concede that cable access is not a constitutionally required entitlement and that the right they claim
to leased and public access has, by definition, been governmentally created at the expense of cable operators' editorial

6 Following Turner, some commentators have questioned the constitutionality of leased and public access. See, e. g., J. Goodale, All About
Cable $ 6.04[5], pp. 6-38.6 to 6-38.7 (1996) ("In the wake of the Supreme
Court's decision in the Turner Broadcasting case, the constitutionality of
both PEG access and leased access requirements would seem open to
searching reexamination. . . . To the extent that an access requirement . . .
is considered to be a content-based restriction on the speech of a cable
system operator, it seems clear, after Turner Broadcasting, that such a
requirement would be found to violate the operator's First Amendment
rights" (footnotes omitted)); Ugland, Cable Television, New Technologies
and the First Amendment After Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v.

the National Information Infrastructure, 30 Wake Forest L. Rev. 51, 66
(1995) (leased access and public access requirements "were called into
question in Turner"). Moreover, as Justice O'Connor noted in Turner,
Congress' imposition of common-carrier-like obligations on cable operators
may raise Takings Clause questions. 512 U. S., at 684 (opinion concurring
in part and dissenting in part). Such questions are not at issue here.

discretion. Just because the Court has apparently accepted,
for now, the proposition that the Constitution permits some
degree of forced speech in the cable context does not mean that
the beneficiaries of a Government-imposed forced speech
program enjoy additional First Amendment protections beyond those normally afforded to purely private speakers.

We have said that "[i]n the realm of private speech or expression, government regulation may not favor one speaker
over another," Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ.
of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 828 (1995), but this principle hardly
supports petitioners' claims, for, if they do anything, the
leased and public access requirements favor access programmers over cable operators. I do not see $$ 10(a) and (c) as
independent restrictions on programmers, but as intricate
parts of the leased and public access restrictions imposed
by Congress (and state and local governments) on cable operators. The question petitioners pose is whether $$ 10(a)
and (c) are improper restrictions on their free speech rights,
but Turner strongly suggests that the proper question is
whether the leased and public access requirements (with

$$ 10(a) and (c)) are improper restrictions on the operators'
free speech rights. In my view, the constitutional presumption properly runs in favor of the operators' editorial discretion, and that discretion may not be burdened without a
compelling reason for doing so. Petitioners' view that
the constitutional presumption favors their asserted right to
speak on access channels is directly contrary to Turner and
our established precedents.

It is one thing to compel an operator to carry leased and
public access speech, in apparent violation of Tornillo, but it
is another thing altogether to say that the First Amendment
forbids Congress to give back part of the operators' editorial
discretion, which all recognize as fundamentally protected,
in favor of a broader access right. It is no answer to say
that leased and public access are content neutral and that

Opinion of Thomas, J.

$$ 10(a) and (c) are not, for that does not change the funda-mental fact, which petitioners never address, that it is the

operators' journalistic freedom that is infringed, whether thechallenged restrictions be content neutral or content based.

Because the access provisions are part of a scheme thatrestricts the free speech rights of cable operators and expands the speaking opportunities of access programmers,who have no underlying constitutional right to speak
through the cable medium, I do not believe that access pro-grammers can challenge the scheme, or a particular part of
it, as an abridgment of their "freedom of speech." Outsidethe public forum doctrine, discussed

infra, at 826-831, Gov-ernment intervention that grants access programmers an opportunity to speak that they would not otherwise enjoy--and which does not directly limit programmers' underlying
speech rights--cannot be an abridgment of the same pro-grammers' First Amendment rights, even if the new speaking opportunity is content based.The permissive nature of $$ 10(a) and (c) is important in
this regard. If Congress had forbidden cable operators tocarry indecent programming on leased and public access
channels, that law would have burdened the programmer'sright, recognized in Turner, supra, at 645, to compete for
space on an operator's system. The Court would undoubt-edly strictly scrutinize such a law. See Sable, 492 U. S., at
126. But $$ 10(a) and (c) do not burden a programmer'sright to seek access for its indecent programming on an operator's system. Rather, they merely restore part of the edi-torial discretion an operator would have absent Government
regulation without burdening the programmer's underlyingspeech rights.

7

7 The plurality, in asserting that $ 10(c) "does not restore to cable operators editorial rights that they once had," ante, at 761, mistakes inability
to exercise a right for absence of the right altogether. That cable operators "have not historically exercised editorial control" over public access

CONSORTIUM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion of Thomas, J.

The First Amendment challenge, if one is to be made, mustcome from the party whose constitutionally protected freedom of speech has been burdened. Viewing the federal ac-cess requirements as a whole, it is the cable operator, not the
access programmer,8 whose speech rights have been in-fringed. Consequently, it is the operator, and not the programmer, whose speech has arguably been infringed bythese provisions. If Congress passed a law forcing bookstores to sell all books published on the subject of congres-sional politics, we would undoubtedly entertain a claim by
bookstores that this law violated the First Amendment prin-ciples established in

Tornillo and Pacific Gas. But I doubtthat we would similarly find merit in a claim by publishers

of gardening books that the law violated their First Amend-ment rights. If that is so, then petitioners in these cases
cannot reasonably assert that the Court should strictly scru-tinize the provisions at issue in a way that maximizes their
ability to speak over leased and public access channels and,by necessity, minimizes the operators' discretion.

B
It makes no difference that the leased access restrictionsmay take the form of common carrier obligations. See

Midwest Video II, 440 U. S., at 701; see also Brief for FederalRespondents 23. But see 47 U. S. C. $ 541(c) ("Any cable

system shall not be subject to regulation as a common carrieror utility by reason of providing any cable service"). That
the leased access provisions may be described in commoncarrier terms does not demonstrate that access programmers

channels, ibid., does not diminish the underlying right to do so, even if the
operator's forbearance is viewed as a contractual quid pro quo for the
local franchise.

8 Turner recognized that the must-carry rules burden programmers

who must compete for space on fewer channels. 512 U. S., at 636-637.
Leased access requirements may also similarly burden programmers who
compete for space on nonaccess channels.

have obtained a First Amendment right to transmit pro-gramming over leased access channels. Labeling leased access a common carrier scheme has no real First Amendmentconsequences. It simply does not follow from common carrier status that cable operators may not, with Congress'
blessing, decline to carry indecent speech on their leased ac-cess channels. Common carriers are private entities and

may, consistent with the First Amendment, exercise editorialdiscretion in the absence of a specific statutory prohibition.
Concurring in Sable, Justice Scalia explained: "I note thatwhile we hold the Constitution prevents Congress from banning indecent speech in this fashion, we do not hold that the
Constitution requires public utilities to carry it." 492 U. S.,
at 133. See also Information Providers' Coalition for Defense of First Amendment v. FCC, 928 F. 2d 866, 877 (CA9
1991) ("[A] carrier is free under the Constitution to terminate
service to dial-a-porn operators altogether"); Carlin Communications, Inc. v. Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph Co., 827 F. 2d 1291, 1297 (CA9 1987) (same), cert. denied, 485 U. S. 1029 (1988); Carlin Communication, Inc. v.
Southern Bell Telephone & Telegraph Co., 802 F. 2d 1352,
1357 (CA11 1986) (same).

Nothing about common carrier status per se constitutionalizes the asserted interests of petitioners in these cases, and
Justice Kennedy provides no authority for his assertion
that common carrier regulations "should be reviewed under
the same standard as content-based restrictions on speech
in a public forum." Ante, at 797. Whether viewed as the
creation of a common carrier scheme or simply as a regulatory restriction on cable operators' editorial discretion, the
net effect is the same: operators' speech rights are restricted
to make room for access programmers. Consequently, the
fact that the leased access provisions impose a form of common carrier obligation on cable operators does not alter my
view that Congress' leased access scheme burdens the constitutionally protected speech rights of cable operators in order

C
Petitioners argue that public access channels are public
forums in which they have First Amendment rights to speak
and that $ 10(c) is invalid because it imposes content-based
burdens on those rights. Brief for Petitioners New York
Citizens Committee for Responsible Media et al. in No. 95-
227, pp. 8-23; Brief for Petitioners Alliance for Community
Media et al. in No. 95-227, pp. 32-35. Though I agree that
content-based prohibitions in a public forum "must be narrowly drawn to effectuate a compelling state interest,"
Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U. S.
37, 46 (1983), I do not agree with petitioners' antecedent assertion that public access channels are public forums.

We have said that government may designate public property for use by the public as a place for expressive activity and that, so designated, that property becomes a public forum. Id., at 45. Petitioners argue that "[a] local
government does exactly that by requiring as a condition
of franchise approval that the cable operator set aside a
public access channel for the free use of the general public on a first-come, first-served, nondiscriminatory basis." 9

9 In Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819,
829-830 (1995), we found the university's student activity fund, a nontangible channel of communication, to be a limited public forum, but generally
we have been quite reluctant to find even limited public forums in such
channels of communication. Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed.
Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 804 (1985) (Combined Federal Campaign not a
limited public forum); Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn.,
460 U. S. 37, 47-48 (1983) (school mail facilities not a limited public forum).
In any event, we certainly have never held that public access channels are
a fully designated public forum that entitles programmers to freedom from
content-based distinctions.

Brief for Petitioners Alliance for Community Media et al. inNo. 95-227, p. 33. I disagree.

Cable systems are not public property.10 Cable systemsare privately owned and privately managed, and petitioners
point to no case in which we have held that government maydesignate private property as a public forum. The public
forum doctrine is a rule governing claims of "a right of accessto public property,"

Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 44, and hasnever been thought to extend beyond property generally understood to belong to the government. See International
Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U. S. 672,
681 (1992) (evidence of expressive activity at rail stations,bus stations, wharves, and Ellis Island was "irrelevant to

public fora analysis, because sites such as bus and rail terminals traditionally have had private ownership" (emphasis inoriginal)). See also

id., at 678 (public forum is "government" or "public" property); Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 45(designated public forum "consists of public property").

Petitioners point to dictum in Cornelius v. NAACP Legal
Defense & Ed. Fund, 473 U. S. 788, 801 (1985), that a public
forum may consist of "private property dedicated to public
use," but that statement has no applicability here. Thatstatement properly refers to the common practice of formally dedicating land for streets and parks when subdividingreal estate for developments. See 1A C. Antieau & J. Antieau, Antieau's Local Government Law $ 9.05 (1991); 11A E.McQuillin, Law of Municipal Corporations $ 33.03 (3d ed.

$ 33.68. To the extent that those easements create a prop-erty interest in the underlying land, it is that governmentowned property interest that may be designated as a publicforum.

It may be true, as petitioners argue, that title is not dis-positive of the public forum analysis, but the nature of the
regulatory restrictions placed on cable operators by localfranchising authorities is not consistent with the kinds of
governmental property interests we have said may be for-mally dedicated as public forums. Our public forum cases
have involved property in which the government has held atleast some formal easement or other property interest permitting the government to treat the property as its own indesignating the property as a public forum. See, e. g.,
Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, 307 U. S.496, 515 (1939) (streets and parks); Police Dept. of Chicago
v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 96 (1972) (sidewalks adjoining publicschool); Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U. S.
546, 555 (1975) (theater under long-term lease to city); Careyv.

Brown, 447 U. S. 455, 460-462 (1980) (sidewalks in front ofprivate residence); Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 267-268

(1981) (university facilities that had been opened for studentactivities). That is simply not true in these cases. Pursuant to federal and state law, franchising authorities requirecable operators to create public access channels, but nothing
in the record suggests that local franchising authorities takeany formal easement or other property interest in those
channels that would permit the government to designatethat property as a public forum.

11

11 Petitioners' argument that a property right called "the right to exclude" has been transferred to the government is not persuasive. Though
it is generally true that, excepting $ 10(c), cable operators are forbidden to
exercise editorial discretion over public access channels, that prohibition
is not absolute. Section 531(e) provides that the prohibition on the exercise of editorial discretion is subject to $ 544(d)(1), which permits operators
and franchising authorities to ban obscene or other constitutionally unprotected speech. Some States, however, have not permitted exercise of that
authority. See, e. g., Minn. Stat. $ 238.11 (1994) (prohibiting any censor518US3$89N 05-29-99 19:07:57 PAGES OPINPGT

829Cite as: 518 U. S. 727 (1996)
Opinion of Thomas, J.
Similarly, assertion of government control over privateproperty cannot justify designation of that property as a

public forum. We have expressly stated that neither gov-ernment ownership nor government control will guarantee
public access to property. See Cornelius, supra, at 803;
Postal Service v. Council of Greenburgh Civic Assns., 453U. S. 114, 129 (1981). Government control over its own

property or private property in which it has taken a cogniza-ble property interest, like the theater in Southeastern Promotions, is consistent with designation of a public forum.But we have never even hinted that regulatory control, and
particularly direct regulatory control over a private entity'sFirst Amendment speech rights, could justify creation of a
public forum. Properly construed, our cases have limitedthe government's ability to declare a public forum to property the government owns outright, or in which the govern-ment holds a significant property interest consistent with the
communicative purpose of the forum to be designated.Nor am I convinced that a formal transfer of a property
interest in public access channels would suffice to permit alocal franchising authority to designate those channels as a
public forum. In no other public forum that we have recog-nized does a private entity, owner or not, have the obligation
not only to permit another to speak, but to actually helpproduce and then transmit the message on that person's behalf. Cable operators regularly retain some level of manage-rial and operational control over their public access channels,
subject only to the requirements of federal, state, and locallaw and the franchise agreement. In more traditional public
forums, the government shoulders the burden of administer-ing and enforcing the openness of the expressive forum, but
it is frequently a private citizen, the operator, who shoul-ders that burden for public access channels. For instance,

ship of leased or public access programming); N. Y. Pub. Serv. Law $ 229
(McKinney Supp. 1996) (same). At any rate, the Court has never recognized a public forum based on a property interest "taken" by regulatory
restriction.

it is often the operator who must accept and schedule anaccess programmer's request for time on a channel.

12 And,

in many places, the operator is actually obligated to provideproduction facilities and production assistance to persons

seeking to produce access programming.13 Moreover, unlikea park picketer, an access programmer cannot transmit its
own message. Instead, it is the operator who must trans-mit, or "speak," the access programmer's message. That the
speech may be considered the operator's is driven home by47 U. S. C. $ 559, which authorizes a fine of up to $10,000 and
two years' imprisonment for any person who "transmits overany cable system any matter which is obscene." See also

12 See D. Brenner, M. Price, & M. Meyerson, Cable Television and Other
Nonbroadcast Video $ 6.04[7] (1996) (hereinafter Brenner). Some States
and local governments have formed nonprofit organizations to perform
some of these functions. See D. C. Code Ann. $ 43-1829(a) (1990 and
Supp. 1996) (establishing Public Access Corporation "for the purpose
of facilitating and governing nondiscriminatory use" of public access

13 See, e. g., 47 U. S. C. $ 541(a)(4)(B) (authorizing franchise authorities to

public, educational, and governmental access channel capacity, facilities,

Thus, even were I inclined to view public access channelsas public property, which I am not, the numerous additional

obligations imposed on the cable operator in managing andoperating the public access channels convince me that these
channels share few, if any, of the basic characteristics of apublic forum. As I have already indicated, public access requirements, in my view, are a regulatory restriction on theexercise of cable operators' editorial discretion, not a transfer of a sufficient property interest in the channels to supporta designation of that property as a public forum. Public access channels are not public forums, and, therefore, petition-ers' attempt to redistribute cable speech rights in their favor
must fail. For this reason, and the other reasons articulatedearlier, I would sustain both $ 10(a) and $ 10(c).

Most sexually oriented programming appears on premiumor pay-per-view channels that are naturally blocked from

programming may appear, to be made part of the basic cablepackage. Section 10(b) does nothing more than adjust the
nature of Government-imposed leased access requirements

14 Petitioners argue that $ 10(d) of the 1992 Act, 47 U. S. C. $ 558, which
lifts cable operators' immunity for obscene speech, forces or encourages
operators to ban indecent speech. Because Congress could directly impose an outright ban on obscene programming, see Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 124 (1989), petitioners' encouragement argument is meritless.

in order to emulate the market forces that keep indecentprogramming primarily on premium channels (without

permitting the operator to charge subscribers for thatprogramming).

Unlike $$ 10(a) and (c), $ 10(b) clearly implicates petitioners' free speech rights. Though $ 10(b) by no means bansindecent speech, it clearly places content-based restrictions

on the transmission of private speech by requiring cable op-erators to block and segregate indecent programming that
the operator has agreed to carry. Consequently, $ 10(b)must be subjected to strict scrutiny and can be upheld only
if it furthers a compelling governmental interest by the least
restrictive means available. See Sable, 492 U. S., at 126.
The parties agree that Congress has a "compelling interest
in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors" and that its interest "extends to shielding minors from
the influence of [indecent speech] that is not obscene by adult
standards." Ibid. See Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629,
639 (1968) (persons "who have th[e] primary responsibility
for children's well-being are entitled to the support of laws
designed to aid discharge of that responsibility"). Because

$ 10(b) is narrowly tailored to achieve that well-established
compelling interest, I would uphold it. I therefore dissent
from the Court's decision to the contrary.

Our precedents establish that government may support
parental authority to direct the moral upbringing of their
children by imposing a blocking requirement as a default
position. For example, in Ginsberg, in which we upheld a
State's ability to prohibit the sale of indecent literature to
minors, we pointed out that the State had simply imposed
its own default choice by noting that "the prohibition against
sales to minors does not bar parents who so desire from purchasing the magazines for their children." Ibid. Likewise,
in Sable we set aside a complete ban on indecent dial-a-porn
messages in part because the FCC had previously imposed
certain default rules intended to prevent access by minors,

The Court strikes down $ 10(b) by pointing to alternatives,such as reverse blocking and lockboxes, that it says are less

restrictive than segregation and blocking. Though thesemethods attempt to place in parents' hands the ability to
permit their children to watch as little, or as much, indecentprogramming as the parents think proper, they do not effectively support parents' authority to direct the moral up-bringing of their children. See First Report and Order,
8 FCC Rcd, at 1000-1001.16 The FCC recognized thatleased access programming comes "from a wide variety of
independent sources, with no single editor controlling [its]selection and presentation."

Id., at 1000. Thus, indecentprogramming on leased access channels is "especially likely

to be shown randomly or intermittently between non-indecent programs."

Ibid. Rather than being able to sim-ply block out certain channels at certain times, a subscriber

armed with only a lockbox must carefully monitor all leasedaccess programming and constantly reprogram the lockbox

15 After Sable, Congress quickly amended the statute and the FCC again
promulgated those "safe harbor" rules. Those rules were later upheld
against a First Amendment challenge. See Dial Information Servs.
Corp. of N. Y. v. Thornburgh, 938 F. 2d 1535 (CA2 1991), cert. denied, 502
U. S. 1072 (1992); Information Providers' Coalition for Defense of First
Amendment v. FCC, 928 F. 2d 866 (CA9 1991). In promulgating regulations pursuant to $ 10(b), the FCC was well aware that the default rules
established for dial-a-porn had been upheld and asserted that similar rules
were necessary for leased access channels. See First Report and Order,
8 FCC Rcd 998, 1000 (1993) ("The blocking scheme upheld in these cases
is, in all relevant respects, identical to that required by section 10(b)");
ibid. ("[J]ust as it did in section 223 relating to `dial-a-porn' telephone
services--Congress has now determined that mandatory, not voluntary,
blocking is essential").

16 In the context of dial-a-porn, courts upholding the FCC's mandatory

blocking scheme have expressly found that voluntary blocking schemes
are not effective. See Dial Information Servs., supra, at 1542; Information Providers' Coalition, supra, at 873-874.

to keep out undesired programming. Thus, even assumingthat cable subscribers generally have the technical proficiency to properly operate a lockbox, by no means a given,this distinguishing characteristic of leased access channels
makes lockboxes and reverse blocking largely ineffective.

Petitioners argue that $ 10(b)'s segregation and blockingscheme is not sufficiently narrowly tailored because it requires the viewer's "written consent," 47 CFR $ 76.701(b)(1995); it permits the cable operator 30 days to respond to
the written request for access, $ 76.701(c); and it is impermis-sibly underinclusive because it reaches only leased access
programming.

Relying on Lamont v. Postmaster General, 381 U. S. 301
(1965), petitioners argue that forcing customers to submit a
written request for access will chill dissemination of speech.
In Lamont, we struck down a statute barring the mail delivery of " `communist political propaganda' " to persons who
had not requested the Post Office in writing to deliver such
propaganda. Id., at 307. The law required the Post Office
to keep an official list of persons desiring to receive communist political propaganda, id., at 303, which, of course, was
intended to chill demand for such materials. Here, however,
petitioners' allegations of an official list "of those who wish
to watch the `patently offensive' channel," as the majority
puts it, ante, at 754, are pure hyperbole. The FCC regulation implementing $ 10(b)'s written request requirement, 47
CFR $ 76.701(b) (1995), says nothing about the creation of a
list, much less an official Government list. It requires only
that the cable operator receive written consent. Other statutory provisions make clear that the cable operator may not
share that, or any other, information with any other person,
including the Government. Section 551 mandates that all
personally identifiable information regarding a subscriber be
kept strictly confidential and further requires cable operators to destroy any information that is no longer necessary
for the purpose for which it was collected. 47 U. S. C. $ 551.

Opinion of Thomas, J.
None of the circumstances that figured prominently in La-mont exists here.

Though petitioners cannot reasonably fear the specter ofan officially published list of leased access indecency viewers,
it is true that the fact that a subscriber is unblocked is ascer-tainable, if only by the cable operator. I find no legally significant stigma in that fact. If a segregation and blockingscheme is generally permissible, then a subscriber's access
request must take some form, whether written or oral, andI see nothing nefarious in Congress' choice of a written,
rather than an oral, consent.17 Any request for access toblocked programming--by whatever method--ultimately
will make the subscriber's identity knowable.18 But this ishardly the kind of chilling effect that implicates the First
Amendment.Though making an oral request for access, perhaps by telephone, is slightly less bothersome than making a written re-quest, it is also true that a written request is less subject
to fraud "by a determined child." Ante, at 759. Conse-quently, despite the fact that an oral request is slightly less
restrictive in absolute terms, it is also less effective in sup-porting parents' interest in denying enterprising, but parentally unauthorized, minors access to blocked programming.The segregation and blocking requirement was not intended to be a replacement for lockboxes, V-chips, reverseblocking, or other subscriber-initiated measures. Rather,
Congress enacted in $ 10(b) a default setting under which asubscriber receives no blocked programming without a writ17 Because, under the circumstances of these cases, I see no constitutionally significant difference between a written and an oral request to see
blocked programming, I also see no relevant distinction between $ 10(b)
and the blocking requirement enacted in the 1996 Act, on which the majority places so much reliance. See ante, at 756-758.

18 Indeed, persons who request access to blocked programming pursuant

to 47 CFR $ 76.701(c) (1995) are no more identifiable than persons who
subscribe to sexually oriented premium channels, because those persons
must specially request that premium service.

ten request. Thus, subscribers who do not want the blockedprogramming are protected, and subscribers who do want it

may request access. Once a subscriber requests access toblocked programming, however, the subscriber remains free
to use other methods, such as lockboxes, to regulate the kindof programming shown on those channels in that home.

19

Thus, petitioners are wrong to portray $ 10(b) as a highlyineffective method of screening individual programs, see

Brief for Petitioners in No. 95-124, at 43, and the majorityis similarly wrong to suggest that a person cannot "watch a
single program . . . without letting the `patently offensive'channel in its entirety invade his household for days, perhaps
weeks, at a time," ante, at 754; see ante, at 756. Given thelimited scope of $ 10(b) as a default setting, I see nothing
constitutionally infirm about Congress' decision to permitthe cable operator 30 days to unblock or reblock the segregated channel.Petitioners also claim that $ 10(b) and its implementing
regulations are impermissibly underinclusive because theyapply only to leased access programming. In R. A. V. v.
St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377 (1992), we rejected the view that acontent-based restriction is subject to a separate and independent "underinclusiveness" evaluation. Id., at 387 ("Inour view, the First Amendment imposes not an `underinclusiveness' limitation but a `content discrimination' limitationupon a State's prohibition of proscribable speech"). See also
ante, at 757 ("Congress need not deal with every problem atonce"). Also, petitioners' claim is in tension with the constitutional principle that Congress may not impose a remedythat is more restrictive than necessary to satisfy its asserted
compelling interest and with their own arguments pressingthat very principle. Cf. R. A. V., supra, at 402 (White, J.,
concurring in judgment) (though the "overbreadth doctrine

has the redeeming virtue of attempting to avoid the chillingof protected expression," an underbreadth challenge "serves

no desirable function").In arguing that Congress could not impose a blocking requirement without also imposing that requirement on public
access and nonaccess channels, petitioners fail to allege,much less argue, that doing so would further Congress' compelling interest. While it is true that indecent program-ming appears on nonaccess channels, that programming appears almost exclusively on "per-program or per channelservices that subscribers must specifically request in advance, in the same manner as under the blocking approachmandated by section 10(b)." First Report and Order, 8
FCC Rcd, at 1001, n. 20.20 In contrast to these premiumservices, leased access channels are part of the basic cable
package, and the segregation and blocking scheme Congressimposed does nothing more than convert sexually oriented
leased access programming into a free "premium service." 21
Similarly, Congress' failure to impose segregation and blocking requirements on public access channels may have been
based on its judgment that those channels presented a less
severe problem of unintended indecency--it appears that
most of the anecdotal evidence before Congress involved
leased access channels. Congress may also have simply de20 In examining the restrictions imposed by the 1996 Act, the majority
is probably correct to doubt that "sex-dedicated channels are all (or
mostly) leased channels," ante, at 757, but surely the majority does not
doubt that most nonleased sex-dedicated channels are premium channels
that must be expressly requested. I thus disagree that the provisions of
the 1996 Act address a "highly similar problem." Ante, at 758.

21 Unlike Congress' blocking scheme, and the market norm of requiring

viewers to pay a premium for indecent programming, lockboxes place a
financial burden on those seeking to avoid indecent programming on leased
access channels. See 47 U. S. C. $ 544(d)(2) ("[A] cable operator shall
provide (by sale or lease) a device by which the subscriber can prohibit
viewing of a particular cable service during periods selected by that
subscriber").

cided to permit the States and local franchising authoritiesto address the issue of indecency on public access channels

and blocking scheme established by Congress is narrowlytailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest, it
does not become constitutionally suspect merely becauseCongress did not extend the same restriction to other channels on which there was less of a perceived problem (andperhaps no compelling interest).

UNITED STATES v. WINSTAR CORP. et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe federal circuit

No. 95-865. Argued April 24, 1996--Decided July 1, 1996
Realizing that the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation

(FSLIC) lacked the funds to liquidate all of the failing thrifts during
the savings and loan crisis of the 1980's, the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board (Bank Board) encouraged healthy thrifts and outside investors
to take over ailing thrifts in a series of "supervisory mergers." As
inducement, the Bank Board agreed to permit acquiring entities to
designate the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets as an intangible asset referred to as supervisory goodwill,
and to count such goodwill and certain capital credits toward the capital
reserve requirements imposed by federal regulations. Congress's
subsequent passage of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery,
and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) forbade thrifts to count goodwill and capital credits in computing the required reserves. Respondents are three thrifts created by way of supervisory mergers. Two of

them were seized and liquidated by federal regulators for failure to meet
FIRREA's capital requirements, and the third avoided seizure through
a private recapitalization. Believing that the Bank Board and FSLIC
had promised that they could count supervisory goodwill toward regulatory capital requirements, respondents each filed suit against the United
States in the Court of Federal Claims, seeking damages for, inter alia,
breach of contract. In granting each respondent summary judgment,
the court held that the Government had breached its contractual obligations and rejected the Government's "unmistakability defense"--that
surrenders of sovereign authority, such as the promise to refrain from
regulatory changes, must appear in unmistakable terms in a contract in
order to be enforceable, see Bowen v. Public Agencies Opposed to Social Security Entrapment, 477 U. S. 41, 52--and its "sovereign act" defense--that a "public and general" sovereign act, such as FIRREA's
alteration of capital reserve requirements, could not trigger contractual
liability, see Horowitz v. United States, 267 U. S. 458, 461. The cases
were consolidated, and the en banc Federal Circuit ultimately affirmed.

Held: The judgment is affirmed, and the case is remanded.
64 F. 3d 1531, affirmed and remanded.

Justice Souter, joined by Justice Stevens, Justice O'Connor,
and Justice Breyer, concluded in Parts II, III, IV, and IV-C that

Syllabus
the United States is liable to respondents for breach of contract.
Pp. 860-896; 904-910.

(a) There is no reason to question the Federal Circuit's conclusion
that the Government had express contractual obligations to permit respondents to use goodwill and capital credits in computing their regulatory capital reserves. When the law as to capital requirements changed,
the Government was unable to perform its promises and became liable
for breach under ordinary contract principles. Pp. 860-871.

(b) The unmistakability doctrine is not implicated here because enforcement of the contractual obligation alleged would not block the Government's exercise of a sovereign power. The courts below did not construe these contracts as binding the Government's exercise of authority
to modify its regulation of thrifts, and there has been no demonstration
that awarding damages for breach would be tantamount to such a limitation. They read the contracts as solely risk-shifting agreements, and
respondents seek nothing more than the benefit of promises by the Government to insure them against any losses arising from future regulatory change. Applying the unmistakability doctrine to such contracts
not only would represent a conceptual expansion of the doctrine beyond
its historical and practical warrant, but also would compromise the Government's practical capacity to make contracts, which is "of the essence
of sovereignty" itself, United States v. Bekins, 304 U. S. 27, 51-52.
Pp. 871-887.

(c) The answer to the Government's unmistakability argument also
meets its two related ultra vires contentions: that, under the reserved
powers doctrine, Congress's power to change the law in the future was
an essential attribute of its sovereignty that the Bank Board and FSLIC
had no authority to bargain away; and that in any event no such authority can be conferred without an express delegation to that effect. A
contract to adjust the risk of subsequent legislative change does not
strip the Government of its legislative sovereignty, and the contracts
did not surrender the Government's sovereign power to regulate. And
there is no serious question that FSLIC (and the Bank Board acting
through it) lacked authority to guarantee respondents against losses
arising from subsequent regulatory changes. Pp. 888-891.

(d) The facts of this case do not warrant application of the sovereign
act doctrine. That doctrine balances the Government's need for freedom to legislate with its obligation to honor its contracts by asking
whether the sovereign act is properly attributable to the Government
as contractor. If the answer is no, the Government's defense to liability
depends on whether that act would otherwise release the Government
from liability under ordinary contract principles. Pp. 891-896.

(e) Even if FIRREA were to qualify as a "public and general" act,
the sovereign act doctrine cannot excuse the Government's breach here.
Since the object of the doctrine is to place the Government as contractor
on par with a private contractor in the same circumstances, Horowitz v.
United States, supra, at 461, the Government, like any other defending
party in a contract action, must show that passage of the statute rendering its performance impossible was an event contrary to the basic assumptions on which the parties agreed, and, ultimately, that the language or circumstances do not indicate that the Government should be
liable in any case. The Government has not satisfied these conditions.
There is no doubt that some changes in the regulatory structure governing thrift capital reserves were both foreseeable and likely when the
parties contracted with the Government. In addition, any governmental contract that not only deals with regulatory change but allocates the
risk of its occurring will, by definition, fail the further condition of a
successful impossibility defense, for it will indeed indicate that the parties' agreement was not meant to be rendered nugatory by a change in
the regulatory law. That the Bank Board and FSLIC could not themselves preclude Congress from changing the regulatory rules does not
stand in the way of concluding that those agencies assumed the risk of
such change, for determining the consequences of legal change was the
point of the agreements. Pp. 904-910.

Justice Souter, joined by Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer,
concluded in Parts IV-A and IV-B that, since the Government should
not be excused by legislation when the substantial effect of regulation
was to help itself out of improvident agreements, it is impossible to
attribute the exculpatory "public and general" character to FIRREA.
Not only did that statute have the purpose of eliminating the very accounting "gimmicks" that acquiring thrifts had been promised, but also
the congressional debates indicate Congress's expectation, which there
is no reason to question, that FIRREA would have a substantial effect
on the Government's contractual obligations. The evidence of Congress's intense concern with contracts like those at issue is not neutralized by the fact that FIRREA did not formally target particular

transactions or by FIRREA's broad purpose to advance the general
welfare. Pp. 896-903.

Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas,
agreed that the Government was contractually obligated to afford respondents favorable accounting treatment, and violated its obligations
when it discontinued that treatment under FIRREA. The Government's sovereign defenses cannot be avoided by characterizing its obligations as not entailing a limitation on the exercise of sovereign power;

842 UNITED STATES v. WINSTAR CORP.

Syllabus
that approach, although adopted by the plurality, is novel and fails
to acknowledge that virtually every contract regarding future conduct
operates as an assumption of liability in the event of nonperformance.
Accordingly, it is necessary to address the Government's various
sovereign defenses, particularly its invocation of the "unmistakability"
doctrine. That doctrine simply embodies the commonsense presumption that governments do not ordinarily agree to curtail their sovereign
or legislative powers. Respondents have overcome that presumption
here in establishing that the Government promised, in unmistakable
terms, to regulate them in a particular fashion, into the future. The
Government's remaining arguments are readily rejected. The "reserved powers" doctrine cannot defeat a claim to recover damages for
breach of contract where subsequent legislation has sought to minimize
monetary risks assumed by the Government. The "express delegation"
doctrine is satisfied here by the statutes authorizing the relevant federal
bank regulatory agencies to enter into the agreements at issue. Finally, the "sovereign acts" doctrine adds little, if anything, to the "unmistakability" doctrine, and cannot be relied upon where the Government has attempted to abrogate the essential bargain of the contract.

The issue in this case is the enforceability of contractsbetween the Government and participants in a regulated industry, to accord them particular regulatory treatment in
exchange for their assumption of liabilities that threatened
to produce claims against the Government as insurer. Although Congress subsequently changed the relevant law, and
thereby barred the Government from specifically honoring
its agreements, we hold that the terms assigning the risk of
regulatory change to the Government are enforceable, and
that the Government is therefore liable in damages for
breach.

Opinion of Souter, J.

I
We said in Fahey v. Mallonee, 332 U. S. 245, 250 (1947),
that "[b]anking is one of the longest regulated and most
closely supervised of public callings." That is particularly
true of the savings and loan, or "thrift," industry, which has
been described as "a federally-conceived and assisted system
to provide citizens with affordable housing funds." H. R.
Rep. No. 101-54, pt. 1, p. 292 (1989) (House Report). Because the contracts at issue in today's case arise out of the
National Government's efforts over the last decade and a
half to preserve that system from collapse, we begin with
an overview of the history of federal savings and loan
regulation.

A

The modern savings and loan industry traces its origins to
the Great Depression, which brought default on 40 percent
of the Nation's $20 billion in home mortgages and the failure
of some 1,700 of the Nation's approximately 12,000 savings
institutions. Id., at 292-293. In the course of the debacle,
Congress passed three statutes meant to stabilize the thrift
industry. The Federal Home Loan Bank Act created the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board (Bank Board), which was
authorized to channel funds to thrifts for loans on houses and
for preventing foreclosures on them. Ch. 522, 47 Stat. 725
(1932) (codified, as amended, at 12 U. S. C. $$ 1421-1449 (1988
ed.)); see also House Report, at 292. Next, the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 authorized the Bank Board to charter
and regulate federal savings and loan associations. Ch. 64,
48 Stat. 128 (1933) (codified, as amended, at 12 U. S. C.

$$ 1461-1468 (1988 ed.)). Finally, the National Housing Act
created the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), under the Bank Board's authority, with responsibility to insure thrift deposits and regulate all federally insured thrifts. Ch. 847, 48 Stat. 1246 (1934) (codified,
as amended, at 12 U. S. C. $$ 1701-1750g (1988 ed.)).

Opinion of Souter, J.
The resulting regulatory regime worked reasonably welluntil the combination of high interest rates and inflation in

the late 1970's and early 1980's brought about a second crisisin the thrift industry. Many thrifts found themselves holding long-term, fixed-rate mortgages created when interestrates were low; when market rates rose, those institutions
had to raise the rates they paid to depositors in order toattract funds. See House Report, at 294-295. When the
costs of short-term deposits overtook the revenues fromlong-term mortgages, some 435 thrifts failed between 1981
and 1983. Id., at 296; see also General Accounting Office,Thrift Industry: Forbearance for Troubled Institutions 1982-
1986, p. 9 (May 1987) (GAO, Forbearance for Troubled Insti-tutions) (describing the origins of the crisis).

The first federal response to the rising tide of thrift fail-ures was "extensive deregulation," including "a rapid expansion in the scope of permissible thrift investment powers anda similar expansion in a thrift's ability to compete for funds
with other financial services providers." House Report, at291; see also

id., at 295-297; Breeden, Thumbs on the Scale:The Role that Accounting Practices Played in the Savings and

Loan Crisis, 59 Ford. L. Rev. S71, S72-S74 (1991) (describinglegislation permitting nonresidential real estate lending by
thrifts and deregulating interest rates paid to thrift deposi-tors).

1 Along with this deregulation came moves to weaken

the requirement that thrifts maintain adequate capital re-serves as a cushion against losses, see 12 CFR $ 563.13

(1981), a requirement that one commentator described as"the most powerful source of discipline for financial institutions." Breeden, supra, at S75. The result was a drop incapital reserves required by the Bank Board from five to

1 The easing of federal regulatory requirements was accompanied by
similar initiatives on the state level, especially in California, Florida, and
Texas. The impact of these changes was substantial, since as of 1980 over
50 percent of federally insured thrifts were chartered by the States. See
House Report, at 297.

purposes of determining compliance with its capital require-ments.

2 According to the House Banking Committee, "[t]he

use of various accounting gimmicks and reduced capitalstandards masked the worsening financial condition of the

industry, and the FSLIC, and enabled many weak institu-tions to continue operating with an increasingly inadequate
cushion to absorb future losses." House Report, at 298.The reductions in required capital reserves, moreover, allowed thrifts to grow explosively without increasing theircapital base, at the same time deregulation let them expand
into new (and often riskier) fields of investment. See Note,
Causes of the Savings and Loan Debacle, 59 Ford. L. Rev.
S301, S311 (1991); Breeden, supra, at S74-S75.

While the regulators tried to mitigate the squeeze on the
thrift industry generally through deregulation, the multitude of already-failed savings and loans confronted FSLIC
with deposit insurance liabilities that threatened to exhaust
its insurance fund. See Olympic Federal Savings and Loan
Assn. v. Director, Office of Thrift Supervision, 732 F. Supp.

2 "Regulatory and statutory accounting gimmicks included permitting
thrifts to defer losses from the sale of assets with below market yields;
permitting the use of income capital certificates, authorized by Congress,
in place of real capital; letting qualifying mutual capital certificates be
included as RAP capital; allowing FSLIC members to exclude from liabilities in computing net worth, certain contra-asset accounts, including loans
in process, unearned discounts, and deferred fees and credits; and permitting the inclusion of net worth certificates, qualifying subordinated debentures and appraised equity capital as RAP net worth." House Report, at
298. The result of these practices was that "[b]y 1984, the difference between RAP and GAAP net worth at S&L's stood at $9 billion," which
meant "that the industry's capital position, or . . . its cushion to absorb
losses was overstated by $9 billion." Ibid.

1980 to $4.55 billion in 1985, GAO, Forbearance for TroubledInstitutions 12, when the Bank Board estimated that it
would take $15.8 billion to close all institutions deemed insol-vent under GAAP. General Accounting Office, Troubled Financial Institutions: Solutions to the Thrift Industry Prob-lem 108 (Feb. 1989) (GAO, Solutions to the Thrift Industry
Problem). By 1988, the year of the last transaction involvedin this case, FSLIC was itself insolvent by over $50 billion.
House Report, at 304. And by early 1989, the GAO esti-mated that $85 billion would be needed to cover FSLIC's
responsibilities and put it back on the road to fiscal health.GAO, Solutions to the Thrift Industry Problem 43. In the
end, we now know, the cost was much more even than that.See, e. g., Horowitz, The Continuing Thrift Bailout, Investor's Business Daily, Feb. 1, 1996, p. A1 (reporting an esti-mated $140 billion total public cost of the savings and loan
crisis through 1995).Realizing that FSLIC lacked the funds to liquidate all of
the failing thrifts, the Bank Board chose to avoid the insur-ance liability by encouraging healthy thrifts and outside
investors to take over ailing institutions in a series of "super-visory mergers." See GAO, Solutions to the Thrift Industry
Problem 52; L. White, The S&L Debacle: Public Policy Les-sons for Bank and Thrift Regulation 157 (1991) (White).

Such transactions, in which the acquiring parties assumedthe obligations of thrifts with liabilities that far outstripped

their assets, were not intrinsically attractive to healthy insti-tutions; nor did FSLIC have sufficient cash to promote such
acquisitions through direct subsidies alone, although cashcontributions from FSLIC were often part of a transaction.
See M. Lowy, High Rollers: Inside the Savings and LoanDebacle 37 (1991) (Lowy). Instead, the principal inducement for these supervisory mergers was an understandingthat the acquisitions would be subject to a particular accounting treatment that would help the acquiring institu-tions meet their reserve capital requirements imposed by
federal regulations. See Investigation of Lincoln Savings &Loan Assn.: Hearing Before the House Committee on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 5,p. 447 (1989) (testimony of M. Danny Wall, Director, Office
of Thrift Supervision) (noting that acquirers of failing thriftswere allowed to use certain accounting methods "in lieu of
[direct] federal financial assistance").

Under GAAP there are circumstances in which a businesscombination may be dealt with by the "purchase method" of

accounting. See generally R. Kay & D. Searfoss, Handbookof Accounting and Auditing 23-21 to 23-40 (2d ed. 1989) (describing the purchase method); Accounting Principles BoardOpinion No. 16 (1970) (establishing rules as to what method
must be applied to particular transactions). The critical as-pect of that method for our purposes is that it permits the
acquiring entity to designate the excess of the purchase price
quoting remarks by H. Brent Beasley, Director of FSLIC, before the California Savings and Loan League Management Conference (Sept. 9, 1982)
(concluding that FSLIC-assisted mergers have " `[h]istorically . . . cost
about 70% of [the] cost of liquidation' "), with GAO, Solutions to the Thrift
Industry Problem 52 ("FSLIC's cost analyses may . . . understat[e] the
cost of mergers to the government").

over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired as anintangible asset called "goodwill." Id., || 11, p. 284; Kay &

Searfoss, supra, at 23-38.4 In the ordinary case, the recog-nition of goodwill as an asset makes sense: a rational purchaser in a free market, after all, would not pay a price fora business in excess of the value of that business's assets
unless there actually were some intangible "going concern"value that made up the difference. See Lowy 39.

5 For that

reason, the purchase method is frequently used to accountfor acquisitions, see A. Phillips, J. Butler, G. Thompson, &

R. Whitman, Basic Accounting for Lawyers 121 (4th ed.1988), and GAAP expressly contemplated its application
to at least some transactions involving savings and loans.See Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation
No. 9 (Feb. 1976). Goodwill recognized under the purchasemethod as the result of an FSLIC-sponsored supervisory
merger was generally referred to as "supervisory goodwill."Recognition of goodwill under the purchase method was
essential to supervisory merger transactions of the type atissue in this case. Because FSLIC had insufficient funds to

acquired by an establishment, beyond the mere value of the capital, stock,
funds, or property employed therein, in consequence of the general public
patronage and encouragement, which it receives from constant or habitual
customers, on account of its local position, or common celebrity, or reputation for skill or affluence, or punctuality, or from other accidental circumstances, or necessities, or even from ancient partialities, or prejudices."

make up the difference between a failed thrift's liabilitiesand assets, the Bank Board had to offer a "cash substitute" to

induce a healthy thrift to assume a failed thrift's obligations.Former Bank Board Chairman Richard Pratt put it this way
in testifying before Congress:

"The Bank Board . . . did not have sufficient resourcesto close all insolvent institutions, [but] at the same time,

it had to consolidate the industry, move weaker institu-tions into stronger hands, and do everything possible to
minimize losses during the transition period. Goodwillwas an indispensable tool in performing this task."

Supervisory goodwill was attractive to healthy thrifts forat least two reasons. First, thrift regulators let the acquiring institutions count supervisory goodwill toward their re-serve requirements under 12 CFR $ 563.13 (1981). This
treatment was, of course, critical to make the transactionpossible in the first place, because in most cases the institution resulting from the transaction would immediately havebeen insolvent under federal standards if goodwill had not
counted toward regulatory net worth. From the acquiring

goodwill as regulatory capital was " `a very important aspect of [the acquiring thrifts'] willingness to enter into these agreements,' " and concluding that the regulators " `looked at [supervisory goodwill] as kind of the
engine that made this transaction go. Because without it, there wouldn't
have been any train pulling out of the station, so to speak' ").

Opinion of Souter, J.
thrift's perspective, however, the treatment of supervisorygoodwill as regulatory capital was attractive because it inflated the institution's reserves, thereby allowing the thriftto leverage more loans (and, it hoped, make more profits).
See White 84; cf. Breeden, 59 Ford. L. Rev., at S75-S76 (ex-plaining how loosening reserve requirements permits asset
expansion).A second and more complicated incentive arose from the
decision by regulators to let acquiring institutions amortizethe goodwill asset over long periods, up to the 40-year maximum permitted by GAAP, see Accounting Principles BoardOpinion No. 17, || 29, p. 340 (1970). Amortization recognizes
that intangible assets such as goodwill are useful for just solong; accordingly, a business must "write down" the value of
the asset each year to reflect its waning worth. See Kay &Searfoss, Handbook of Accounting and Auditing, at 15-36 to
15-37; Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 17, supra,|| 27, at 339-340.

7 The amount of the write down is reflected

on the business's income statement each year as an operatingexpense. See generally E. Faris, Accounting and Law in a

Nutshell $ 12.2(q) (1984) (describing amortization of good-will). At the same time that it amortizes its goodwill asset,

7 In this context, "amortization" of an intangible asset is equivalent
to depreciation of tangible assets. See Newark Morning Ledger Co. v.
United States, supra, at 571, n. 1 (Souter, J., dissenting); Gregorcich,
Amortization of Intangibles: A Reassessment of the Tax Treatment of
Purchased Goodwill, 28 Tax Lawyer 251, 253 (1975). Both the majority

opinion and dissent in Newark Morning Ledger agreed that "goodwill"
was not subject to depreciation (or amortization) for federal tax purposes,
see 507 U. S., at 565, n. 13; id., at 573 (Souter, J., dissenting), although
we disagreed as to whether one could accurately estimate the useful life
of certain elements of goodwill and, if so, permit depreciation of those

elements under Internal Revenue Service regulations. Id., at 566-567;
id., at 576-577 (Souter, J., dissenting). Neither of the Newark Morning
Ledger opinions, however, denied the power of another federal agency,
such as the Bank Board or FSLIC, to decide that goodwill is of transitory
value and impose a particular amortization period to be used for its own
regulatory purposes.

Opinion of Souter, J.
however, an acquiring thrift must also account for changesin the value of its loans, which are its principal assets. The

loans acquired as assets of the failed thrift in a supervisorymerger were generally worth less than their face value, typically because they were issued at interest rates below the
market rate at the time of the acquisition. See Black, End-ing Our Forebearers' Forbearances: FIRREA and Supervisory Goodwill, 2 Stan. L. & Policy Rev. 102, 104-105 (1990).This differential or "discount," J. Rosenberg, Dictionary of
Banking and Financial Services 233 (2d ed. 1985), appears onthe balance sheet as a "contra-asset" account, or a deduction
from the loan's face value to reflect market valuation of the
asset, R. Estes, Dictionary of Accounting 29 (1981). Because loans are ultimately repaid at face value, the magnitude of the discount declines over time as redemption
approaches; this process, technically called "accretion of discount," is reflected on a thrift's income statement as a series
of capital gains. See Rosenberg, supra, at 9; Estes, supra,
at 39-40.

The advantage in all this to an acquiring thrift depends
upon the fact that accretion of discount is the mirror image of
amortization of goodwill. In the typical case, a failed thrift's
primary assets were long-term mortgage loans that earned
low rates of interest and therefore had declined in value to
the point that the thrift's assets no longer exceeded its liabilities to depositors. In such a case, the disparity between
assets and liabilities from which the accounting goodwill was
derived was virtually equal to the value of the discount from
face value of the thrift's outstanding loans. See Black, 2
Stan. L. & Policy Rev., at 104-105. Thrift regulators, however, typically agreed to supervisory merger terms that allowed acquiring thrifts to accrete the discount over the average life of the loans (approximately seven years), see id., at
105, while permitting amortization of the goodwill asset over
a much longer period. Given that goodwill and discount
were substantially equal in overall values, the more rapid

853Cite as: 518 U. S. 839 (1996)
Opinion of Souter, J.
accrual of capital gain from accretion resulted in a net paperprofit over the initial years following the acquisition. See

ibid.; Lowy 39-40.8 The difference between amortizationand accretion schedules thus allowed acquiring thrifts to
seem more profitable than they in fact were.Some transactions included yet a further inducement,
described as a "capital credit." Such credits arose when
FSLIC itself contributed cash to further a supervisorymerger and permitted the acquiring institution to count the

FSLIC contribution as a permanent credit to regulatory cap-ital. By failing to require the thrift to subtract this FSLIC
contribution from the amount of supervisory goodwill gener-ated by the merger, regulators effectively permitted double
counting of the cash as both a tangible and an intangible
asset. See, e. g., Transohio Savings Bank v. Director, Office
of Thrift Supervision, 967 F. 2d 598, 604 (CADC 1992).
Capital credits thus inflated the acquiring thrift's regulatory
capital and permitted leveraging of more and more loans.

As we describe in more detail below, the accounting treatment to be accorded supervisory goodwill and capital credits
was the subject of express arrangements between the regulators and the acquiring institutions. While the extent to
which these arrangements constituted a departure from
prior norms is less clear, an acquiring institution would rea8 See also National Commission on Financial Institution Reform, Recovery and Enforcement, Origins and Causes of the S&L Debacle: A Blueprint for Reform, A Report to the President and Congress of the United
States 38-39 (July 1993) (explaining the advantages of different amortization and accretion schedules to an acquiring thrift). The downside of a
faster accretion schedule, of course, was that it exhausted the discount
long before the goodwill asset had been fully amortized. As a result, this
treatment resulted in a net drag on earnings over the medium and long
terms. See Lowy 40-41; Black, Ending Our Forebearers' Forbearances:
FIRREA and Supervisory Goodwill, 2 Stan. L. & Policy Rev. 102, 104-105
(1990). Many thrift managers were apparently willing to take the shortterm gain, see Lowy 40-41, and others sought to stave off the inevitable
losses by pursuing further acquisitions, see Black, supra, at 105.

sonably have wanted to bargain for such treatment. Although GAAP demonstrably permitted the use of the purchase method in acquiring a thrift suffering no distress,
the relevant thrift regulations did not explicitly state that
intangible goodwill assets created by that method could be
counted toward regulatory capital. See 12 CFR $ 563.13
(a)(3) (1981) (permitting thrifts to count as reserves any
"items listed in the definition of net worth"); $ 561.13(a) (defining "net worth" as "the sum of all reserve accounts . . . ,
retained earnings, permanent stock, mutual capital certificates . . . , and any other non-withdrawable accounts of an
insured institution").9 Indeed, the rationale for recognizing
goodwill stands on its head in a supervisory merger: ordinarily, goodwill is recognized as valuable because a rational
purchaser would not pay more than assets are worth; here,
however, the purchase is rational only because of the accounting treatment for the shortfall. See Black, supra, at
104 ("GAAP's treatment of goodwill . . . assumes that buyers
do not overpay when they purchase an S&L"). In the end,
of course, such reasoning circumvented the whole purpose of
the reserve requirements, which was to protect depositors
and the deposit insurance fund. As some in Congress later
recognized, "[g]oodwill is not cash. It is a concept, and a
shadowy one at that. When the Federal Government liquidates a failed thrift, goodwill is simply no good. It is valueless. That means, quite simply, that the taxpayer picks up
the tab for the shortfall." 135 Cong. Rec. 11795 (1989) (remarks of Rep. Barnard); see also White 84 (acknowledging

9 The 1981 regulations quoted above were in effect at the time of the
Glendale transaction. The 1984 regulations relevant to the Winstar
transaction were identical in all material respects, and although substantial changes had been introduced into $ 563.13 by the time of the Statesman merger in 1988, they do not appear to resolve the basic ambiguity as
to whether goodwill could qualify as regulatory capital. See 12 CFR

$ 563.13 (1988). Section 563.13 has since been superseded by the Financial
Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act.

that in some instances supervisory goodwill "involved thecreation of an asset that did not have real value as protection

for the FSLIC"). To those with the basic foresight to ap-preciate all this, then, it was not obvious that regulators
would accept purchase accounting in determining compliancewith regulatory criteria, and it was clearly prudent to get
agreement on the matter.The advantageous treatment of amortization schedules
and capital credits in supervisory mergers amounted to moreclear-cut departures from GAAP and, hence, subjects worthy
of agreement by those banking on such treatment. In 1983,the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the font of
GAAP) promulgated Statement of Financial AccountingStandards No. 72 (SFAS 72), which applied specifically to
the acquisition of a savings and loan association. SFAS 72provided that "[i]f, and to the extent that, the fair value of
liabilities assumed exceeds the fair value of identifiableassets acquired in the acquisition of a banking or thrift institution, the unidentifiable intangible asset recognized gener-ally shall be amortized to expense by the interest method
over a period no longer than the discount on the long-terminterest-bearing assets acquired is to be recognized as interest income." Accounting Standards, Original Pronounce-ments (July 1973-June 1, 1989), p. 725. In other words,
SFAS 72 eliminated any doubt that the differential amortiza-tion periods on which acquiring thrifts relied to produce
paper profits in supervisory mergers were inconsistent withGAAP. SFAS 72 also barred double counting of capital
credits by requiring that financial assistance from regulatoryauthorities must be deducted from the cost of the acquisition
before the amount of goodwill is determined. SFAS 72,|| 9.

10 Although the Glendale transaction in this case occurred before the
promulgation of SFAS 72 in 1983, the proper amortization period for goodwill under GAAP was uncertain prior to that time. According to one

every reason for concern as to the continued availability ofthe RAP in effect at the time of these transactions.

Although the results of the forbearance policy, includingthe departures from GAAP, appear to have been mixed, see

GAO, Forbearance for Troubled Institutions 4, it is relativelyclear that the overall regulatory response of the early and
mid-1980's was unsuccessful in resolving the crisis in thethrift industry. See,

e. g., Transohio Savings Bank, 967
F. 2d, at 602 (concluding that regulatory measures "actually
aggravat[ed] the decline"). As a result, Congress enactedthe Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), Pub. L. 101-73, 103 Stat. 183,with the objects of preventing the collapse of the industry,
attacking the root causes of the crisis, and restoring public
confidence.

FIRREA made enormous changes in the structure of federal thrift regulation by (1) abolishing FSLIC and transferring its functions to other agencies; (2) creating a new thrift
deposit insurance fund under the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation; (3) replacing the Bank Board with the Office
of Thrift Supervision (OTS), a Treasury Department office
with responsibility for the regulation of all federally insured
savings associations; and (4) establishing the Resolution
Trust Corporation to liquidate or otherwise dispose of
certain closed thrifts and their assets. See note following 12 U. S. C. $ 1437, $$ 1441a, 1821. More importantly for
the present case, FIRREA also obligated OTS to "prescribe and maintain uniformly applicable capital standards
for savings associations" in accord with strict statutory reing rules in the early 1970s, they didn't anticipate the case of insolvent
thrift institutions . . . . The rules for that situation were simply unclear
until September 1982," when the SFAS 72 rules were first aired. Lowy

quirements. $ 1464(t)(1)(A).11 In particular, the statute re-quired thrifts to "maintain core capital in an amount not less

than 3 percent of the savings association's total assets,"$ 1464(t)(2)(A), and defined "core capital" to exclude "unidentifiable intangible assets," $ 1464(t)(9)(A), such as goodwill.
Although the reform provided a "transition rule" permittingthrifts to count "qualifying supervisory goodwill" toward

half the core capital requirement, this allowance was phasedout by 1995. $ 1464(t)(3)(A). According to the House Report, these tougher capital requirements reflected a congres-sional judgment that "[t]o a considerable extent, the size of
the thrift crisis resulted from the utilization of capital gim-micks that masked the inadequate capitalization of thrifts."
House Report, at 310.

The impact of FIRREA's new capital requirements uponinstitutions that had acquired failed thrifts in exchange for

supervisory goodwill was swift and severe. OTS promptly
issued regulations implementing the new capital standards
along with a bulletin noting that FIRREA "eliminates [capital and accounting] forbearances" previously granted to certain thrifts. Office of Thrift Supervision, Capital Adequacy:
Guidance on the Status of Capital and Accounting Forbearances and Capital Instruments held by a Deposit Insurance
Fund, Thrift Bulletin No. 38-2, Jan. 9, 1990. OTS accordingly directed that "[a]ll savings associations presently operating with these forbearances . . . should eliminate them in
determining whether or not they comply with the new minimum regulatory capital standards." Ibid. Despite the
statute's limited exception intended to moderate transitional

pains, many institutions immediately fell out of compliancewith regulatory capital requirements, making them subject

to seizure by thrift regulators. See Black, 2 Stan. L. & Pol-icy Rev., at 107 ("FIRREA's new capital mandates have
caused over 500 S&Ls . . . to report that they have failed oneor more of the three capital requirements").

D
This case is about the impact of FIRREA's tightened capi-tal requirements on three thrift institutions created by way

of supervisory mergers. Respondents Glendale FederalBank, FSB, Winstar Corporation, and The Statesman Group,
Inc., acquired failed thrifts in 1981, 1984, and 1988, respec-tively. After the passage of FIRREA, federal regulators
seized and liquidated the Winstar and Statesman thrifts forfailure to meet the new capital requirements. Although the
Glendale thrift also fell out of regulatory capital complianceas a result of the new rules, it managed to avoid seizure
through a massive private recapitalization. Believing thatthe Bank Board and FSLIC had promised them that the supervisory goodwill created in their merger transactionscould be counted toward regulatory capital requirements, respondents each filed suit against the United States in theCourt of Federal Claims, seeking monetary damages on both
contractual and constitutional theories. That court grantedrespondents' motions for partial summary judgment on contract liability, finding in each case that the Government hadbreached contractual obligations to permit respondents to
count supervisory goodwill and capital credits toward theirregulatory capital requirements. See

the Government: that the Government could not be held toa promise to refrain from exercising its regulatory authority
in the future unless that promise was unmistakably clear in
the contract, Winstar I, supra, at 116; Winstar II, supra,at 544-549;

in the regulatory capital requirements. Winstar Corp. v.
United States, 994 F. 2d 797, 811-813 (1993). The full court,
however, vacated this decision and agreed to rehear the case
en banc. After rebriefing and reargument, the en banc
court reversed the panel decision and affirmed the Court
of Federal Claims' rulings on liability. Winstar Corp. v.
United States, 64 F. 3d 1531 (1995). The Federal Circuit
found that FSLIC had made express contracts with respondents, including a promise that supervisory goodwill and
capital credits could be counted toward satisfaction of the
regulatory capital requirements. Id., at 1540, 1542-1543.
The court rejected the Government's unmistakability argument, agreeing with the Court of Federal Claims that that
doctrine had no application in a suit for money damages.
Id., at 1545-1548. Finally, the en banc majority found that
FIRREA's new capital requirements "single[d] out supervisory goodwill for special treatment" and therefore could not
be said to be a "public" and "general act" within the meaning
of the sovereign acts doctrine. Id., at 1548-1551. Judge
Nies dissented, essentially repeating the arguments in her

was a public and general act, id., at 1552-1553. We grantedcertiorari, 516 U. S. 1087 (1996), and now affirm.

We took this case to consider the extent to which specialrules, not generally applicable to private contracts, govern

enforcement of the governmental contracts at issue here.We decide whether the Government may assert four special
defenses to respondents' claims for breach: the canon of con-tract construction that surrenders of sovereign authority
must appear in unmistakable terms, Bowen v. Public Agencies Opposed to Social Security Entrapment, 477 U. S. 41,52 (1986); the rule that an agent's authority to make such

surrenders must be delegated in express terms, Home Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Los Angeles, 211 U. S. 265 (1908);the doctrine that a government may not, in any event, contract to surrender certain reserved powers, Stone v. Missis-sippi, 101 U. S. 814 (1880); and, finally, the principle that a
Government's sovereign acts do not give rise to a claim forbreach of contract, Horowitz v. United States, 267 U. S. 458,
460 (1925).The anterior question whether there were contracts at all
between the Government and respondents dealing with reg-ulatory treatment of supervisory goodwill and capital credits, although briefed and argued by the parties in this Court,is not strictly before us. See

Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S.519, 535 (1992) (noting that "we ordinarily do not consider

questions outside those presented in the petition for cer-tiorari"); this Court's Rule 14.1(a). And although we may
review the Court of Federal Claims' grant of summaryjudgment

de novo, Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Techni-cal Services, Inc., 504 U. S. 451, 465, n. 10 (1992), we are in

no better position than the Federal Circuit and the Courtof Federal Claims to evaluate the documentary records of

the transactions at issue. Our resolution of the legal issuesraised by the petition for certiorari, however, does require some consideration of the nature of the underlyingtransactions.

A
The Federal Circuit found that "[t]he three plaintiff thriftsnegotiated contracts with the bank regulatory agencies that

allowed them to include supervisory goodwill (and capitalcredits) as assets for regulatory capital purposes and to amortize that supervisory goodwill over extended periods oftime." 64 F. 3d, at 1545. Although each of these transactions was fundamentally similar, the relevant circumstancesand documents vary somewhat from case to case.

1
In September 1981, Glendale was approached about a pos-sible merger by the First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Broward County, which then had liabilities exceedingthe fair value of its assets by over $734 million. At the time,
Glendale's accountants estimated that FSLIC would haveneeded approximately $1.8 billion to liquidate Broward, only
about $1 billion of which could be recouped through the saleof Broward's assets. Glendale, on the other hand, was both
profitable and well capitalized, with a net worth of $277 mil-lion.

12 After some preliminary negotiations with the regulators, Glendale submitted a merger proposal to the BankBoard, which had to approve all mergers involving savings

and loan associations, see 12 U. S. C. $$ 1467a(e)(1)(A) and(B); $ 1817( j)(1); that proposal assumed the use of the purchase method of accounting to record supervisory goodwillarising from the transaction, with an amortization period of
40 years. The Bank Board ratified the merger, or "Supervi-sory Action Agreement" (SAA), on November 19, 1981.

12 Glendale's premerger net worth amounted to 5.45 percent of its total
assets, which comfortably exceeded the 4 percent capital/asset ratio, or
net worth requirement, then in effect. See 12 CFR $ 563.13(a)(2) (1981).

518US3$90m 05-29-99 19:20:28 PAGES OPINPGT
862 UNITED STATES v. WINSTAR CORP.

Opinion of Souter, J.
The SAA itself said nothing about supervisory goodwill,but did contain the following integration clause:

"This Agreement . . . constitutes the entire agreementbetween the parties thereto and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings of the parties in connec-tion herewith, excepting only the Agreement of Merger
and any resolutions or letters issued contemporaneouslyherewith." App. 598-599.

The SAA thereby incorporated Bank Board ResolutionNo. 81-710, by which the Board had ratified the SAA. That
resolution referred to two additional documents: a letter tobe furnished by Glendale's independent accountant identifying and supporting the use of any goodwill to be recorded onGlendale's books, as well as the resulting amortization periods; and "a stipulation that any goodwill arising from this
transaction shall be determined and amortized in accordancewith [Bank Board] Memorandum R-31b."

Id., at 607.
Memorandum R-31b, finally, permitted Glendale to use thepurchase method of accounting and to recognize goodwill as

an asset subject to amortization. See id., at 571-574.The Government does not seriously contest this evidence
that the parties understood that goodwill arising from thesetransactions would be treated as satisfying regulatory requirements; it insists, however, that these documents simply
reflect statements of then-current federal regulatory policyrather than contractual undertakings. Neither the Court of

Federal Claims nor the Federal Circuit so read the record,however, and we agree with those courts that the Government's interpretation of the relevant documents is fundamentally implausible. The integration clause in Glendale's SAA
with FSLIC, which is similar in all relevant respects to the
analogous provisions in the Winstar and Statesman contracts, provides that the SAA supersedes "all prior agreements and understandings . . . excepting only . . . any resolutions or letters issued contemporaneously" by the Board, id.,

863Cite as: 518 U. S. 839 (1996)
Opinion of Souter, J.
at 598-599; in other words, the SAA characterizes theBoard's resolutions and letters not as statements of background rules, but as part of the "agreements and under-standings" between the parties.

To the extent that the integration clause leaves any ambiguity, the other courts that construed the documents foundthat the realities of the transaction favored reading those

documents as contractual commitments, not mere statementsof policy, see Restatement (Second) of Contracts $ 202(1)
(1981) ("Words and other conduct are interpreted in the lightof all the circumstances, and if the principal purpose of the
parties is ascertainable it is given great weight"), and we see
no reason to disagree. As the Federal Circuit noted, "[i]t
is not disputed that if supervisory goodwill had not been
available for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements, the merged thrift would have been subject to regulatory noncompliance and penalties from the moment of its
creation." 64 F. 3d, at 1542. Indeed, the assumption of
Broward's liabilities would have rendered Glendale immediately insolvent by approximately $460 million, but for Glendale's right to count goodwill as regulatory capital. Although one can imagine cases in which the potential gain
might induce a party to assume a substantial risk that the
gain might be wiped out by a change in the law, it would
have been irrational in this case for Glendale to stake its
very existence upon continuation of current policies without
seeking to embody those policies in some sort of contractual
commitment. This conclusion is obvious from both the dollar amounts at stake and the regulators' proven propensity
to make changes in the relevant requirements. See Brief
for United States 26 ("[I]n light of the frequency with which
federal capital requirements had changed in the past . . . , it
would have been unreasonable for Glendale, FSLIC, or the
Bank Board to expect or rely upon the fact that those requirements would remain unchanged"); see also infra, at
909-910. Under the circumstances, we have no doubt that

Opinion of Souter, J.
the parties intended to settle regulatory treatment of thesetransactions as a condition of their agreement. See, e. g.,

The Binghamton Bridge, 3 Wall. 51, 78 (1866) (refusing toconstrue charter in such a way that it would have been "madness" for private party to enter into it).13 We accordinglyhave no reason to question the Court of Appeals's conclusion
that "the government had an express contractual obligationto permit Glendale to count the supervisory goodwill generated as a result of its merger with Broward as a capital assetfor regulatory capital purposes." 64 F. 3d, at 1540.

In 1983, FSLIC solicited bids for the acquisition of Win-dom Federal Savings and Loan Association, a Minnesotabased thrift in danger of failing. At that time, the estimatedcost to the Government of liquidating Windom was approximately $12 million. A group of private investors formedWinstar Corporation for the purpose of acquiring Windom
and submitted a merger plan to FSLIC; it called for capitalcontributions of $2.8 million from Winstar and $5.6 million
from FSLIC, as well as for recognition of supervisory good-will to be amortized over a period of 35 years.

The Bank Board accepted the Winstar proposal and madean Assistance Agreement that incorporated, by an integration clause much like Glendale's, both the Board's resolutionapproving the merger and a forbearance letter issued on the
date of the agreement. See App. 112. The forbearance let-ter provided that "[f]or purposes of reporting to the Board,
the value of any intangible assets resulting from accountingfor the merger in accordance with the purchase method may
be amortized by [Winstar] over a period not to exceed 35

to the city authorities the absolute right completely to nullify the chief
consideration for seeking this property, . . . or that the parties then took
that view of the transaction").

years by the straight-line method." Id., at 123. Moreover,the Assistance Agreement itself contained an "Accounting

Principles" section with the following provisions:

"Except as otherwise provided, any computations made
for the purposes of this Agreement shall be governedby generally accepted accounting principles as applied

on a going concern basis in the savings and loan indus-try, except that where such principles conflict with the
terms of this Agreement, applicable regulations of theBank Board or the [FSLIC], or any resolution or action
of the Bank Board approving or adopted concurrently
with this Agreement, then this Agreement, such regula-tions, or such resolution or action shall govern. . . . If

there is a conflict between such regulations and theBank Board's resolution or action, the Bank Board's resolution or action shall govern. For purposes of this sec-tion, the governing regulations and the accounting principles shall be those in effect on the Effective Date or
as subsequently clarified, interpreted, or amended bythe Bank Board or the Financial Accounting Standards

Board ("FASB"), respectively, or any successor organi-zation to either."

Id., at 108-109.

The Government emphasizes the last sentence of this clause,
which provides that the relevant accounting principles may
be "subsequently clarified . . . or amended," as barring anyinference that the Government assumed the risk of regulatory change. Its argument, however, ignores the preced-ing sentence providing that the Bank Board's resolutions
and actions in connection with the merger must prevail over
contrary regulations. If anything, then, the accounting
principles clause tilts in favor of interpreting the contract
to lock in the then-current regulatory treatment of supervisory goodwill.

In any event, we do not doubt the soundness of the Federal
Circuit's finding that the overall "documentation in the Win518US3$90m 05-29-99 19:20:28 PAGES OPINPGT

star transaction establishes an express agreement allowingWinstar to proceed with the merger plan approved by the

Bank Board, including the recording of supervisory goodwillas a capital asset for regulatory capital purposes to be amortized over 35 years." 64 F. 3d, at 1544. As in the Glendaletransaction, the circumstances of the merger powerfully support this conclusion: The tangible net worth of the acquiredinstitution was a negative $6.7 million, and the new Winstar
thrift would have been out of compliance with regulatorycapital standards from its very inception, without including
goodwill in the relevant calculations. We thus accept theCourt of Appeals's conclusion that "it was the intention of
the parties to be bound by the accounting treatment forgoodwill arising in the merger." Ibid.

Statesman, another nonthrift entity, approached FSLIC in1987 about acquiring a subsidiary of First Federated Savings

Bank, an insolvent Florida thrift. FSLIC responded that ifStatesman wanted Government assistance in the acquisition
it would have to acquire all of First Federated as well asthree shaky thrifts in Iowa. Statesman and FSLIC ultimately agreed on a complex plan for acquiring the fourthrifts; the agreement involved application of the purchase
method of accounting, a $21 million cash contribution fromStatesman to be accompanied by $60 million from FSLIC,
and (unlike the Glendale and Winstar plans) treatment of $26million of FSLIC's contribution as a permanent capital credit
to Statesman's regulatory capital.The Assistance Agreement between Statesman and
FSLIC included an "accounting principles" clause virtuallyidentical to Winstar's, see App. 402-403, as well as a specific
provision for the capital credit:

"For the purposes of reports to the Bank Board . . . ,$26 million of the contribution [made by FSLIC] shall

be credited to [Statesman's] regulatory capital account

Opinion of Souter, J.
and shall constitute regulatory capital (as defined in$ 561.13 of the Insurance Regulations)." Id., at 362a.

As with Glendale and Winstar, the agreement had an inte-gration clause incorporating contemporaneous resolutions
and letters issued by the Board. Id., at 407-408. TheBoard's resolution explicitly acknowledged both the capital
credits and the creation of supervisory goodwill to be amor-tized over 25 years, id., at 458-459, and the Forbearance Letter likewise recognized the capital credit provided for in theagreement.

Id., at 476. Finally, the parties executed a sep-arate Regulatory Capital Maintenance Agreement stating

that, "[i]n consideration of the mutual promises contained[t]herein," id., at 418, Statesman would be obligated to maintain the regulatory capital of the acquired thrifts "at thelevel . . . required by $ 563.13(b) of the Insurance Regulations
. . . or any successor regulation . . . ." The agreement fur-ther provided, however, that "[f]or purposes of this Agreement, any determination of [Statesman's] Required Regula-tory Capital . . . shall include . . . amounts permitted by the
FSLIC in the Assistance Agreement and in the forbearancesissued in connection with the transactions discussed herein."
Id., at 418-419. Absent those forbearances, Statesman'sthrift would have remained insolvent by almost $9 million
despite the cash infusions provided by the parties to thetransaction.

For the same reasons set out above with respect to theGlendale and Winstar transactions, we accept the Federal
Circuit's conclusion that "the government was contractuallyobligated to recognize the capital credits and the supervisory
goodwill generated by the merger as part of the Statesman'sregulatory capital requirement and to permit such goodwill
to be amortized on a straight line basis over 25 years." 64F. 3d, at 1543. Indeed, the Government's position is even
weaker in Statesman's case because the capital credits por-tion of the agreement contains an express commitment to
include those credits in the calculation of regulatory capital.

868 UNITED STATES v. WINSTAR CORP.

Opinion of Souter, J.
The Government asserts that the reference to $ 563.13 ofFSLIC regulations, which at the time defined regulatory

capital for thrift institutions, indicates that the Govern-ment's obligations could change along with the relevant regulations. But, just as in Winstar's case, the Governmentwould have us overlook the specific incorporation of the
then-current regulations as part of the agreement.14 TheGovernment also cites a provision requiring Statesman to
"comply in all material respects with all applicable statutes,regulations, orders of, and restrictions imposed by the
United States or . . . by any agency of [the United States],"App. 407, but this simply meant that Statesman was required
to observe FIRREA's new capital requirements once theywere promulgated. The clause was hardly necessary to
oblige Statesman to obey the law, and nothing in it barredStatesman from asserting that passage of that law required
the Government to take action itself or be in breach of itscontract.

B
It is important to be clear about what these contracts didand did not require of the Government. Nothing in the documentation or the circumstances of these transactions pur-ported to bar the Government from changing the way in
which it regulated the thrift industry. Rather, what theFederal Circuit said of the Glendale transaction is true of the
Winstar and Statesman deals as well: "the Bank Board andthe FSLIC were contractually bound to recognize the supervisory goodwill and the amortization periods reflected" inthe agreements between the parties. 64 F. 3d, at 1541-1542.
We read this promise as the law of contracts has alwaystreated promises to provide something beyond the promi14 As part of the contract, the Government's promise to count supervisory goodwill and capital credits toward regulatory capital was alterable
only by written agreement of the parties. See App. 408. This was also
true of the Glendale and Winstar transactions. See id., at 112, 600.

sor's absolute control, that is, as a promise to insure thepromisee against loss arising from the promised condition's

nonoccurrence.15 Holmes's example is famous: "[i]n the caseof a binding promise that it shall rain to-morrow, the immediate legal effect of what the promisor does is, that he takesthe risk of the event, within certain defined limits, as between himself and the promisee." Holmes, The CommonLaw (1881), in 3 The Collected Works of Justice Holmes 268
(S. Novick ed. 1995).16 Contracts like this are especially appropriate in the world of regulated industries, where the riskthat legal change will prevent the bargained-for performance

is always lurking in the shadows. The drafters of the Re-statement attested to this when they explained that, "[w]ith
the trend toward greater governmental regulation . . . par-ties are increasingly aware of such risks, and a party may

a. "Such an agreement," according
to the Restatement, "is usually interpreted as one to pay

15 To be sure, each side could have eliminated any serious contest about
the correctness of their interpretive positions by using clearer language.
See, e. g., Guaranty Financial Services, Inc. v. Ryan, 928 F. 2d 994, 999-
1000 (CA11 1991) (finding, based on very different contract language, that
the Government had expressly reserved the right to change the capital
requirements without any responsibility to the acquiring thrift). The failure to be even more explicit is perhaps more surprising here, given the
size and complexity of these transactions. But few contract cases would
be in court if contract language had articulated the parties' postbreach
positions as clearly as might have been done, and the failure to specify
remedies in the contract is no reason to find that the parties intended no
remedy at all. The Court of Claims and Federal Circuit were thus left
with the familiar task of determining which party's interpretation was
more nearly supported by the evidence.

16 See also Day v. United States, 245 U. S. 159, 161 (1917) (Holmes, J.)

("One who makes a contract never can be absolutely certain that he will
be able to perform it when the time comes, and the very essence of it is
that he takes the risk within the limits of his undertaking").

damages if performance is prevented rather than one to ren-der a performance in violation of law." Ibid.

17

When the law as to capital requirements changed in thepresent instance, the Government was unable to perform its

promise and, therefore, became liable for breach. We acceptthe Federal Circuit's conclusion that the Government
breached these contracts when, pursuant to the new regula-tory capital requirements imposed by FIRREA, 12 U. S. C.

$ 1464(t), the federal regulatory agencies limited the use ofsupervisory goodwill and capital credits in calculating respondents' net worth. 64 F. 3d, at 1545. In the case ofWinstar and Statesman, the Government exacerbated its
breach when it seized and liquidated respondents' thrifts forregulatory noncompliance. Ibid.

In evaluating the relevant documents and circumstances,we have, of course, followed the Federal Circuit in applying

F. 2d 953, 957-959 (CA Fed. 1993) (interpreting contractual incorporation

ordinary principles of contract construction and breach thatwould be applicable to any contract action between private

parties. The Government's case, however, is that the Fed-eral Circuit's decision to apply ordinary principles was error
for a variety of reasons, each of which we consider, and re-ject, in the sections ahead.

III
The Government argues for reversal, first, on the principlethat "contracts that limit the government's future exercises

of regulatory authority are strongly disfavored; such con-tracts will be recognized only rarely, and then only when
the limitation on future regulatory authority is expressed inunmistakable terms." Brief for United States 16. Hence,
the Government says, the agreements between the BankBoard, FSLIC, and respondents should not be construed to
waive Congress's authority to enact a subsequent bar tousing supervisory goodwill and capital credits to meet regulatory capital requirements.The argument mistakes the scope of the unmistakability
doctrine. The thrifts do not claim that the Bank Board andFSLIC purported to bind Congress to ossify the law in conformity to the contracts; they seek no injunction against ap-plication of FIRREA's new capital requirements to them and
no exemption from FIRREA's terms. They simply claimthat the Government assumed the risk that subsequent
changes in the law might prevent it from performing, andagreed to pay damages in the event that such failure to perform caused financial injury. The question, then, is notwhether Congress could be constrained but whether the doctrine of unmistakability is applicable to any contract claimagainst the Government for breach occasioned by a subsequent Act of Congress. The answer to this question is no.

The unmistakability doctrine invoked by the Governmentwas stated in Bowen v. Public Agencies Opposed to Social

Security Entrapment: " `[S]overeign power . . . governs allcontracts subject to the sovereign's jurisdiction, and will remain intact unless surrendered in unmistakable terms.' "477 U. S., at 52 (quoting Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe,
455 U. S. 130, 148 (1982)). This doctrine marks the point ofintersection between two fundamental constitutional concepts, the one traceable to the theory of parliamentary sover-eignty made familiar by Blackstone, the other to the theory
that legislative power may be limited, which became familiarto Americans through their experience under the colonial
charters, see G. Wood, Creation of the American Republic1776-1787, pp. 268-271 (1969).

In his Commentaries, Blackstone stated the centuries-oldconcept that one legislature may not bind the legislative authority of its successors:

"Acts of parliament derogatory from the power of subse-quent parliaments bind not. . . . Because the legislature,

being in truth the sovereign power, is always of equal,always of absolute authority: it acknowledges no superior upon earth, which the prior legislature must havebeen, if it's

[sic] ordinances could bind the present par-liament." 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws

of England 90 (1765).18
In England, of course, Parliament was historically supremein the sense that no "higher law" limited the scope of legislative action or provided mechanisms for placing legally en-forceable limits upon it in specific instances; the power of
American legislative bodies, by contrast, is subject to theoverriding dictates of the Constitution and the obligations
that it authorizes. See Eule, Temporal Limits on the Legis-lative Mandate: Entrenchment and Retroactivity, 1987 Am.

18 See also H. Hart, The Concept of Law 145 (1961) (recognizing that
Parliament is "sovereign, in the sense that it is free, at every moment of
its existence as a continuing body, not only from legal limitations imposed
ab extra, but also from its own prior legislation").

the Atlantic the principle has always lived in some tensionwith the constitutionally created potential for a legislature,

under certain circumstances, to place effective limits on itssuccessors, or to authorize executive action resulting in such
a limitation.The development of this latter, American doctrine in federal litigation began in cases applying limits on state sover-eignty imposed by the National Constitution. Thus Chief
Justice Marshall's exposition in Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87(1810), where the Court held that the Contract Clause, U. S.
Const., Art. I, $ 10, cl. 1, barred the State of Georgia's effortto rescind land grants made by a prior state legislature.
Marshall acknowledged "that one legislature is competent torepeal any act which a former legislature was competent to
pass; and that one legislature cannot abridge the powers of asucceeding legislature." 6 Cranch, at 135. "The correctness
of this principle, so far as respects general legislation," he said,"can never be controverted." Ibid. Marshall went on to
qualify the principle, however, noting that "if an act be doneunder a law, a succeeding legislature cannot undo it. The
past cannot be recalled by the most absolute power." Ibid.For Marshall, this was true for the two distinct reasons that
the intrusion on vested rights by the Georgia Legislature'sAct of repeal might well have gone beyond the limits of "the

legislative power," and that Georgia's legislative sovereignty
was limited by the Federal Constitution's bar against laws
impairing the obligation of contracts. Id., at 135-136.

The impetus for the modern unmistakability doctrine was
thus Chief Justice Marshall's application of the Contract
Clause to public contracts. Although that Clause made it
possible for state legislatures to bind their successors by entering into contracts, it soon became apparent that such contracts could become a threat to the sovereign responsibilities
of state governments. Later decisions were accordingly
less willing to recognize contractual restraints upon legislative freedom of action, and two distinct limitations developed
to protect state regulatory powers. One came to be known
as the "reserved powers" doctrine, which held that certain
substantive powers of sovereignty could not be contracted
away. See West River Bridge Co. v. Dix, 6 How. 507 (1848)
(holding that a State's contracts do not surrender its eminent
domain power).20 The other, which surfaced somewhat earlier in Providence Bank v. Billings, 4 Pet. 514 (1830), and
Proprietors of Charles River Bridge v. Proprietors of Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 420 (1837), was a canon of construction
disfavoring implied governmental obligations in public contracts. Under this rule that "[a]ll public grants are strictly
construed," The Delaware Railroad Tax, 18 Wall. 206, 225
(1874), we have insisted that "[n]othing can be taken against
the State by presumption or inference," ibid., and that "neither the right of taxation, nor any other power of sovereignty, will be held . . . to have been surrendered, unless

Government Contracts: Escaping from the Governmental/Proprietary
Maze, 75 Iowa L. Rev. 277, 290-299 (1990) (recounting the early development of the reserved powers doctrine). We discuss the application of the

such surrender has been expressed in terms too plain to bemistaken." Jefferson Branch Bank v. Skelly, 1 Black 436,

446 (1862).The posture of the government in these early unmistakability cases is important. In each, a state or local govern-ment entity had made a contract granting a private party
some concession (such as a tax exemption or a monopoly),and a subsequent governmental action had abrogated the
contractual commitment. In each case, the private partywas suing to invalidate the abrogating legislation under the
Contract Clause. A requirement that the government's ob-ligation unmistakably appear thus served the dual purposes
of limiting contractual incursions on a State's sovereign pow-ers and of avoiding difficult constitutional questions about
the extent of state authority to limit the subsequent exerciseof legislative power. Cf. Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S.568, 575 (1988) ("[W]here an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems,the Court will construe the statute to avoid such problems
unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent ofCongress");

Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 348 (1936)(Brandeis, J., concurring) (same).

The same function of constitutional avoidance has markedthe expansion of the unmistakability doctrine from its Contract Clause origins dealing with state grants and contractsto those of other governmental sovereigns, including the
United States. See Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455U. S., at 148 (deriving the unmistakability principle from

St.Louis v. United Railways Co., 210 U. S. 266 (1908), a Contract Clause suit against a state government).21 Although

Bank v. Billings, 4 Pet. 514 (1830), and Proprietors of Charles River

opinion in United Railways relied heavily upon New Orleans City & Lake

the Contract Clause has no application to acts of the UnitedStates, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. R. A.

Gray & Co., 467 U. S. 717, 732, n. 9 (1984), it is clear that theNational Government has some capacity to make agreements
binding future Congresses by creating vested rights, see,
e. g., Perry v. United States, 294 U. S. 330 (1935); Lynch v.United States, 292 U. S. 571 (1934). The extent of that capacity, to be sure, remains somewhat obscure. Compare,e. g., United States Trust Co. of N. Y. v. New Jersey, 431 U. S.
1, 26 (1977) (heightened Contract Clause scrutiny whenStates abrogate their own contractual obligations), with Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, supra, at 733 (contrast-ing less exacting due process standards governing federal
economic legislation affecting private contracts). But thewant of more developed law on limitations independent of
the Contract Clause is in part the result of applying the un-mistakability canon of construction to avoid this doctrinal
thicket, as we have done in several cases involving allegedsurrenders of sovereign prerogatives by the National Government and Indian tribes.First, we applied the doctrine to protect a tribal sovereign
in Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, supra, which held thatlong-term oil and gas leases to private parties from an Indian
Tribe, providing for specific royalties to be paid to the Tribe,did not limit the Tribe's sovereign prerogative to tax the
proceeds from the lessees' drilling activities. Id., at 148.

Opinion of Souter, J.
Because the lease made no reference to the Tribe's taxingpower, we held simply that a waiver of that power could not

be "inferred . . . from silence," ibid., since the taxing powerof any government remains "unless it is has been specifically
surrendered in terms which admit of no other reasonable interpretation." Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citationomitted).

In Bowen v. Public Agencies Opposed to Social Security
Entrapment, 477 U. S. 41 (1986), this Court confronted a
state claim that $ 103 of the Social Security Amendments Actof 1983, 97 Stat. 71, 42 U. S. C. $ 418(g) (1982 ed., Supp. II),

was unenforceable to the extent it was inconsistent with the
terms of a prior agreement with the National Government.
Under the law before 1983, a State could agree with the Secretary of Health and Human Services to cover the State's
employees under the Social Security scheme subject to a
right to withdraw them from coverage later. When the 1983
Act eliminated the right of withdrawal, the State of California and related plaintiffs sought to enjoin application of the
new law to them, or to obtain just compensation for loss of
the withdrawal right (a remedy which the District Court interpreted as tantamount to the injunction, since it would
mandate return of all otherwise required contributions, see
477 U. S., at 51). Although we were able to resolve the case
by reading the terms of a state-federal coverage agreement
to reserve the Government's right to modify its terms by
subsequent legislation, in the alternative we rested the decision on the more general principle that, absent an "unmistakable" provision to the contrary, "contractual arrangements,
including those to which a sovereign itself is a party, `remain
subject to subsequent legislation' by the sovereign." Id., at
52 (quoting Merrion, supra, at 147). We thus rejected the
proposal "to find that a `sovereign forever waives the right
to exercise one of its sovereign powers unless it expressly
reserves the right to exercise that power in' the contract,"
Bowen, supra, at 52 (quoting Merrion, supra, at 148), and

Opinion of Souter, J.
held instead that unmistakability was needed for waiver,not reservation.

Most recently, in United States v. Cherokee Nation ofOkla., 480 U. S. 700 (1987), we refused to infer a waiver of
federal sovereign power from silence. There, an IndianTribe with property rights in a riverbed derived from a Government treaty sued for just compensation for damage to itsinterests caused by the Government's navigational improvements to the Arkansas River. The claim for compensationpresupposed, and was understood to presuppose, that the
Government had conveyed to the Tribe its easement to con-trol navigation; absent that conveyance, the Tribe's property
included no right to be free from the Government's riverbedimprovements. Id., at 704. We found, however, that the
treaty said nothing about conveying the Government's navi-gational easement, see id., at 706, which we saw as an aspect
of sovereignty. This, we said, could be " `surrendered [only]in unmistakable terms,' " id., at 707 (quoting Bowen, supra,
at 52), if indeed it could be waived at all.

Merrion, Bowen, and Cherokee Nation thus announceno new rule distinct from the canon of construction adopted

in Providence Bank and Charles River Bridge; their collec-tive holding is that a contract with a sovereign government
will not be read to include an unstated term exempting theother contracting party from the application of a subsequent
sovereign act (including an Act of Congress), nor will an am-biguous term of a grant or contract be construed as a conveyance or surrender of sovereign power. The cases extendingback into the 19th century thus stand for a rule that applies
when the Government is subject either to a claim that itscontract has surrendered a sovereign power

22 (e. g., to tax or

22 "Sovereign power" as used here must be understood as a power that
could otherwise affect the Government's obligation under the contract.
The Government could not, for example, abrogate one of its contracts by
a statute abrogating the legal enforceability of that contract, Government contracts of a class including that one, or simply all Government con518US3$90m 05-29-99 19:20:28 PAGES OPINPGT

Opinion of Souter, J.
control navigation), or to a claim that cannot be recognized
without creating an exemption from the exercise of such a
power (e. g., the equivalent of exemption from Social Security obligations). The application of the doctrine thus turns
on whether enforcement of the contractual obligation alleged would block the exercise of a sovereign power of the
Government.

Since the criterion looks to the effect of a contract's enforcement, the particular remedy sought is not dispositive
and the doctrine is not rendered inapplicable by a request
for damages, as distinct from specific performance. The
respondents in Cherokee Nation sought nothing beyond
damages, but the case still turned on the unmistakability
doctrine because there could be no claim to harm unless
the right to be free of the sovereign power to control navigation had been conveyed away by the Government.23 So, too,
in Bowen: the sole relief sought was dollars and cents, but
the award of damages as requested would have been the

tracts. No such legislation would provide the Government with a defense
under the sovereign acts doctrine, see infra, at 891-899.

23 The Government's right to take the Tribe's property upon payment of

compensation, of course, did not depend upon the navigational servitude;
where it applies, however, the navigational easement generally obviates
the obligation to pay compensation at all. See, e. g., United States v. Kansas City Life Ins. Co., 339 U. S. 799, 808 (1950) ("When the Government
exercises [the navigational] servitude, it is exercising its paramount power
in the interest of navigation, rather than taking the private property of
anyone"); Scranton v. Wheeler, 179 U. S. 141, 163 (1900) ("Whatever the
nature of the interest of a riparian owner in the submerged lands in front
of his upland bordering on a public navigable water, his title is not as full
and complete as his title to fast land which has no direct connection with
the navigation of such water. It is a qualified title . . . to be held at all
times subordinate to such use of the submerged lands and of the waters
flowing over them as may be consistent with or demanded by the public
right of navigation"). Because an order to pay compensation would have
placed the Government in the same position as if the navigational easement had been surrendered altogether, the holding of Cherokee Nation is
on all fours with the approach we describe today.

Opinion of Souter, J.
equivalent of exemption from the terms of the subsequentstatute.

The application of the doctrine will therefore differ accord-ing to the different kinds of obligations the Government may
assume and the consequences of enforcing them. At one endof the wide spectrum are claims for enforcement of contractual obligations that could not be recognized without effec-tively limiting sovereign authority, such as a claim for rebate
under an agreement for a tax exemption. Granting a re-bate, like enjoining enforcement, would simply block the exercise of the taxing power, cf. Bowen, 477 U. S., at 51, andthe unmistakability doctrine would have to be satisfied.

24

At the other end are contracts, say, to buy food for the army;no sovereign power is limited by the Government's promise

to purchase and a claim for damages implies no such limita-tion. That is why no one would seriously contend that enforcement of humdrum supply contracts might be subject tothe unmistakability doctrine. Between these extremes lies
an enormous variety of contracts including those underwhich performance will require exercise (or not) of a power
peculiar to the Government. So long as such a contract isreasonably construed to include a risk-shifting component
that may be enforced without effectively barring the exer-cise of that power, the enforcement of the risk allocation
raises nothing for the unmistakability doctrine to guardagainst, and there is no reason to apply it.

24 The dissent is mistaken in suggesting there is question begging in
speaking of what a Government contract provides without first applying
the unmistakability doctrine, see post, at 929. A contract may reasonably
be read under normal rules of construction to contain a provision that
does not satisfy the more demanding standard of unmistakable clarity. If
an alleged term could not be discovered under normal standards, there
would be no need for an unmistakability doctrine. It would, of course,
make good sense to apply the unmistakability rule if it was clear from the
start that a contract plaintiff could not obtain the relief sought without
effectively barring exercise of a sovereign power, as in the example of the
promisee of the tax exemption who claims a rebate.

Opinion of Souter, J.
The Government argues that enforcement of the contractsin this case would implicate the unmistakability principle,

with the consequence that Merrion, Bowen, and Cherokee
Nation are good authorities for rejecting respondents'
claims. The Government's position is mistaken, however,
for the complementary reasons that the contracts have notbeen construed as binding the Government's exercise of authority to modify banking regulation or of any other sover-eign power, and there has been no demonstration that
awarding damages for breach would be tantamount to anysuch limitation.

As construed by each of the courts that considered these
contracts before they reached us, the agreements do not purport to bind the Congress from enacting regulatory measures, and respondents do not ask the courts to infer from
silence any such limit on sovereign power as would violate
the holdings of Merrion and Cherokee Nation. The contracts have been read as solely risk-shifting agreements and
respondents seek nothing more than the benefit of promises
by the Government to insure them against any losses arising
from future regulatory change. They seek no injunction
against application of the law to them, as the plaintiffs did in
Bowen and Merrion, cf. Reichelderfer v. Quinn, 287 U. S.
315 (1932), and they acknowledge that the Bank Board and
FSLIC could not bind Congress (and possibly could not even
bind their future selves) not to change regulatory policy.

Nor do the damages respondents seek amount to exemption from the new law, in the manner of the compensation
sought in Bowen, see 477 U. S., at 51. Once general jurisdiction to make an award against the Government is conceded,
a requirement to pay money supposes no surrender of sovereign power by a sovereign with the power to contract. See,
e. g., Amino Bros. Co. v. United States, 178 Ct. Cl. 515, 525,
372 F. 2d 485, 491 ("The Government cannot make a binding
contract that it will not exercise a sovereign power, but it

the Government be required to make up any capital deficiency arising from the exclusion of goodwill and capital
credits from the relevant calculations, such relief would
hardly amount to an exemption from the capital requirements of FIRREA; after all, Glendale (the only respondent
thrift still in operation) would still be required to maintain
adequate tangible capital reserves under FIRREA, and the
purpose of the statute, the protection of the insurance fund,
would be served. Nor would such a damages award deprive
the Government of money it would otherwise be entitled to
receive (as a tax rebate would), since the capital require25 See also Hughes Communications Galaxy, Inc. v. United States, 998

We recognize, of course, that while agreements to insureprivate parties against the costs of subsequent regulatory

change do not directly impede the exercise of sovereignpower, they may indirectly deter needed governmental regulation by raising its costs. But all regulations have theircosts, and Congress itself expressed a willingness to bear the
costs at issue here when it authorized FSLIC to "guarantee[acquiring thrifts] against loss" that might occur as a result
of a supervisory merger. 12 U. S. C. $ 1729(f )(2) (1988 ed.)(repealed 1989). Just as we have long recognized that the
Constitution " `bar[s] Government from forcing some peoplealone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice,
should be borne by the public as a whole,' " Dolan v. City ofTigard, 512 U. S. 374, 384 (1994) (quoting Armstrong v.
United States, 364 U. S. 40, 49 (1960)), so we must reject thesuggestion that the Government may simply shift costs of
legislation onto its contractual partners who are adverselyaffected by the change in the law, when the Government has
assumed the risk of such change.The Government's position would not only thus represent
a conceptual expansion of the unmistakability doctrine be-yond its historical and practical warrant, but would place the
doctrine at odds with the Government's own long-run inter-est as a reliable contracting partner in the myriad workaday
transaction of its agencies. Consider the procurement con26 This point underscores the likelihood that damages awards will have
the same effect as an injunction only in cases, like Bowen, where a private
party seeks the return of payments to the Government. The classic examples, of course, are tax cases like St. Louis v. United Railways Co., 210
U. S. 266 (1908). Because a request for rebate damages in that case would
effectively have exempted the plaintiffs from the law by forcing the reimbursement of their tax payments, the dissent is quite wrong to suggest,
see post, at 928-929, that the plaintiffs could have altered the outcome by
pleading their case differently.

tracts that can be affected by congressional or executivescale backs in federal regulatory or welfare activity; or contracts to substitute private service providers for the Govern-ment, which could be affected by a change in the official philosophy on privatization; or all the contracts to dispose of
federal property, surplus or otherwise. If these contractsare made in reliance on the law of contract and without specific provision for default mechanisms,27 should all the pri-vate contractors be denied a remedy in damages unless they
satisfy the unmistakability doctrine? The answer is obvi-ously no because neither constitutional avoidance nor any
apparent need to protect the Government from the con-sequences of standard operations could conceivably justify applying the doctrine. Injecting the opportunity for un-mistakability litigation into every common contract action
would, however, produce the untoward result of compromising the Government's practical capacity to make contracts,
which we have held to be "of the essence of sovereignty"
itself. United States v. Bekins, 304 U. S. 27, 51-52 (1938).28
From a practical standpoint, it would make an inroad on this
power, by expanding the Government's opportunities for contractual abrogation, with the certain result of undermining
the Government's credibility at the bargaining table and increasing the cost of its engagements. As Justice Brandeis

as well as private debtors." Lynch v. United States, 292U. S., at 580.

29

The dissent's only answer to our concern is to recognizethat "Congress may not simply abrogate a statutory provision obligating performance without breaching the contractand rendering itself liable for damages."

Post, at 929 (citingLynch, supra, at 580). Yet the only grounds that statement

suggests for distinguishing Lynch from the present case isthat there the contractual obligation was embodied in a statute. Putting aside the question why this distinction shouldmake any difference, we note that the dissent seemingly does
not deny that its view would apply the unmistakability doc-trine to the vast majority of governmental contracts, which
would be subject to abrogation arguments based on subsequent sovereign acts. Indeed, the dissent goes so far as toargue that our conclusion that damages are available for

breach even where the parties did not specify a remedy inthe contract depends upon "reading of additional terms into
the contract." Post, at 930. That, of course, is not the law;
damages are always the default remedy for breach of con-tract.

30 And we suspect that most Government contractors

would be quite surprised by the dissent's conclusion that,
where they have failed to require an express provision that

terms of increased default premiums in future government contracts and
increased disenchantment with the government generally").

the rules"); 3 E. Farnsworth, Contracts $ 12.8, p. 185 (1990) ("The award

damages will be available for breach, that remedy must be
"implied in law" and therefore unavailable under the Tucker
Act, ibid.

Nor can the dissenting view be confined to those contracts
that are "regulatory" in nature. Such a distinction would
raise enormous analytical difficulties; one could ask in this
case whether the Government as contractor was regulating
or insuring. The dissent understandably does not advocate
such a distinction, but its failure to advance any limiting
principle at all would effectively compromise the Government's capacity as a reliable, straightforward contractor
whenever the subject matter of a contract might be subject
to subsequent regulation, which is most if not all of the
time.31 Since the facts of the present case demonstrate that
the Government may wish to further its regulatory goals
through contract, we are unwilling to adopt any rule of construction that would weaken the Government's capacity to
do business by converting every contract it makes into an
arena for unmistakability litigation.

In any event, we think the dissent goes fundamentally
wrong when it concludes that "the issue of remedy for . . .
breach" can arise only "[i]f the sovereign did surrender its
power unequivocally." Post, at 929. This view ignores the

other, less remarkable possibility actually found by bothcourts that construed these contracts: that the Government

agreed to do something that did not implicate its sovereignpowers at all, that is, to indemnify its contracting partners
against financial losses arising from regulatory change. Weaccordingly hold that the Federal Circuit correctly refused
to apply the unmistakability doctrine here. See 64 F. 3d, at1548. There being no need for an unmistakably clear "second promise" not to change the capital requirements, it issufficient that the Government undertook an obligation that
it subsequently found itself unable to perform. This conclu-sion does not, of course, foreclose the assertion of a defense
that the contracts were ultra vires or that the Government'sobligation should be discharged under the common-law doctrine of impossibility, see infra, at 888-891, 904-910, butnothing in the nature of the contracts themselves raises a
bar to respondents' claims for breach.32

32 Justice Scalia offers his own theory of unmistakability, see post, at
919-922, which would apply in a wide range of cases and so create some
tension with the general principle that the Government is ordinarily
treated just like a private party in its contractual dealings, see, e. g., Perry
v. United States, 294 U. S., at 352, but which would be satisfied by an
inference of fact and therefore offer a only a low barrier to litigation of
constitutional issues if a party should, in fact, prove a governmental promise not to change the law. Justice Scalia seeks to minimize the latter
concern by quoting Holmes's pronouncement on damages as the exclusive
remedy at law for breach of contract, see post, at 919-920, but this ignores
the availability of specific performance in a nontrivial number of cases, see,
e. g., Restatement (Second) of Contracts $$ 357-359, including the Contract
Clause cases in which the unmistakability doctrine itself originated. See,
e. g., Carter v. Greenhow, 114 U. S. 317, 322 (1885) (stating that "the only
right secured" by the Contract Clause is "to have a judicial determination,
declaring the nullity of the attempt to impair [the contract's] obligation");

declaring the statute unconstitutional. The provision does not authorize

The answer to the Government's unmistakability argument also meets its two related contentions on the score of
ultra vires: that the Bank Board and FSLIC had no authority
to bargain away Congress's power to change the law in the
future, and that we should in any event find no such authority conferred without an express delegation to that effect.
The first of these positions rests on the reserved powers doctrine, developed in the course of litigating claims that States
had violated the Contract Clause. See supra, at 874. It
holds that a state government may not contract away "an
essential attribute of its sovereignty," United States Trust,
431 U. S., at 23, with the classic example of its limitation
on the scope of the Contract Clause being found in Stone v.
Mississippi, 101 U. S. 814 (1880). There a corporation bargained for and received a state legislative charter to conduct
lotteries, only to have them outlawed by statute a year later.
This Court rejected the argument that the charter immunized the corporation from the operation of the statute, holding that "the legislature cannot bargain away the police
power of a State." Id., at 817.33

The Government says that "[t]he logic of the doctrine . . .
applies equally to contracts alleged to have been made by
the federal government." Brief for United States 38. This

118 (1981) (arguing that "Holmes's celebrated dictum . . . goes too far, is
too simple"). Finally, we have no need to consider the close relationship
that Justice Scalia sees between the unmistakability and sovereign acts
doctrines, see post, at 923-924, because, even considered separately, neither one favors the Government in this case.

33 See also Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Goldsboro, 232 U. S. 548, 558

(1914) ("[T]he power of the State to establish all regulations that are reasonably necessary to secure the health, safety, good order, comfort, or
general welfare of the community . . . can neither be abdicated nor bargained away, and is inalienable even by express grant"); West River

may be so but is also beside the point, for the reason that
the Government's ability to set capital requirements is not
limited by the Bank Board's and FSLIC's promises to make
good any losses arising from subsequent regulatory changes.
See supra, at 882-883. The answer to the Government's
contention that the State cannot barter away certain elements of its sovereign power is that a contract to adjust the
risk of subsequent legislative change does not strip the Government of its legislative sovereignty.34

The same response answers the Government's demand for
express delegation of any purported authority to fetter the
exercise of sovereign power. It is true, of course, that in
Home Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Los Angeles, 211 U. S.,
at 273, we said that "[t]he surrender, by contract, of a power
of government, though in certain well-defined cases it may
be made by legislative authority, is a very grave act, and the
surrender itself, as well as the authority to make it, must
be closely scrutinized." Hence, where "a contract has the
effect of extinguishing pro tanto an undoubted power of
government," we have insisted that "both [the contract's]
existence and the authority to make it must clearly and
unmistakably appear, and all doubts must be resolved in
favor of the continuance of the power." Ibid. But Home
Telephone & Telegraph simply has no application to the pres34 To the extent that Justice Scalia finds the reserved powers doctrine
inapplicable because "the private party to the contract does not seek to
stay the exercise of sovereign authority, but merely requests damages for
breach of contract," post, at 923, he appears to adopt a distinction between
contracts of indemnity and contracts not to change the law similar to the
unmistakability analysis he rejects. He also suggests that the present
case falls outside the "core governmental powers" that cannot be surrendered under the reserved powers doctrine, but this suggestion is inconsistent with our precedents. See Stone v. Mississippi, 101 U. S. 814, 817
(1880) ("[T]he legislature cannot bargain away the police power of a
State"); Veix v. Sixth Ward Building & Loan Assn. of Newark, 310 U. S.
32, 38 (1940) (recognizing that thrift regulation is within the police power).

ent case, because there were no contracts to surrender theGovernment's sovereign power to regulate.

35

There is no question, conversely, that the Bank Board andFSLIC had ample statutory authority to do what the Court

of Federal Claims and the Federal Circuit found they did do,that is, promise to permit respondents to count supervisory
goodwill and capital credits toward regulatory capital and topay respondents' damages if that performance became impossible. The organic statute creating FSLIC as an arm ofthe Bank Board, 12 U. S. C. $ 1725(c) (1988 ed.) (repealed
1989), generally empowered it "[t]o make contracts," 36 and$ 1729(f )(2), enacted in 1978, delegated more specific powers
in the context of supervisory mergers:

"Whenever an insured institution is in default or, inthe judgment of the Corporation, is in danger of default,

the Corporation may, in order to facilitate a merger orconsolidation of such insured institution with another insured institution . . . guarantee such other insured insti-tution against loss by reason of its merging or consolidating with or assuming the liabilities and purchasingthe assets of such insured institution in or in danger of
default." 12 U. S. C. $ 1729(f )(2) (1976 ed., Supp. V) (re-pealed 1989).

Nor is there any reason to suppose that the breadth of thisauthority was not meant to extend to contracts governing
treatment of regulatory capital. Congress specifically rec35 See Speidel, Implied Duties of Cooperation and the Defense of Sovereign Acts in Government Contracts, 51 Geo. L. J. 516, 542 (1963) ("[W]hile

States will not perform future acts of effective government, they can

ognized FSLIC's authority to permit thrifts to count good-will toward capital requirements when it modified the National Housing Act in 1987:

NLRB v. Bell AerospaceCo., 416 U. S. 267, 275 (1974) ("[S]ubsequent legislation declaring the intent of an earlier statute is entitled to signifi-cant weight"). There is no serious question that FSLIC

IV
The Government's final line of defense is the sovereignacts doctrine, to the effect that " `[w]hatever acts the government may do, be they legislative or executive, so long as theybe public and general, cannot be deemed specially to alter,
modify, obstruct or violate the particular contracts intowhich it enters with private persons.' " Horowitz v. United
States, 267 U. S., at 461 (quoting Jones v. United States, 1 Ct.Cl. 383, 384 (1865)). Because FIRREA's alteration of the

regulatory capital requirements was a "public and generalact," the Government says, that act could not amount to a
breach of the Government's contract with respondents.The Government's position cannot prevail, however, for
two independent reasons. The facts of this case do not war-rant application of the doctrine, and even if that were otherwise the doctrine would not suffice to excuse liability underthis governmental contract allocating risks of regulatory
change in a highly regulated industry.

Opinion of Souter, J.
In Horowitz, the plaintiff sued to recover damages forbreach of a contract to purchase silk from the Ordnance

Department. The agreement included a promise by the De-partment to ship the silk within a certain time, although the
manner of shipment does not appear to have been a subjectof the contract. Shipment was delayed because the United
States Railroad Administration placed an embargo on ship-ments of silk by freight, and by the time the silk reached
Horowitz the price had fallen, rendering the deal unprofit-able. This Court barred any damages award for the delay,
noting that "[i]t has long been held by the Court of Claimsthat the United States when sued as a contractor cannot be
held liable for an obstruction to the performance of the par-ticular contract resulting from its public and general acts as
a sovereign." 267 U. S., at 461. This statement was not,however, meant to be read as broadly as the Government
urges, and the key to its proper scope is found in that portionof our opinion explaining that the essential point was to put
the Government in the same position that it would have en-joyed as a private contractor:

" `The two characters which the government possessesas a contractor and as a sovereign cannot be thus fused;
nor can the United States while sued in the one charac-ter be made liable in damages for their acts done in the
other. Whatever acts the government may do, be theylegislative or executive, so long as they be public and
general, cannot be deemed specially to alter, modify, obstruct or violate the particular contracts into which itenters with private persons. . . . In this court the United

States appear simply as contractors; and they are to be
held liable only within the same limits that any otherdefendant would be in any other court. Though their

sovereign acts performed for the general good may workinjury to some private contractors, such parties gain
nothing by having the United States as their defend518US3$90m 05-29-99 19:20:28 PAGES OPINPGT

ants.' " Ibid. (quoting Jones v. United States, supra,at 384).

The early Court of Claims cases upon which Horowitz re-lied anticipated the Court's emphasis on the Government's
dual and distinguishable capacities and on the need to treatthe Government-as-contractor the same as a private party.
In Deming v. United States, 1 Ct. Cl. 190 (1865), the Courtof Claims rejected a suit by a supplier of army rations whose
costs increased as a result of Congress's passage of the LegalTender Act. The

Deming court thought it "grave error" tosuppose that "general enactments of Congress are to be construed as evasions of [the plaintiff 's] particular contract."Id., at 191. "The United States as a contractor are not responsible for the United States as a lawgiver," the court said."In this court the United States can be held to no greater
liability than other contractors in other courts." Ibid.Similarly,

Jones v. United States, supra, refused a suit bysurveyors employed by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs,

whose performance had been hindered by the UnitedStates's withdrawal of troops from Indian country. "The
United States as a contractor," the Claims Court concluded,"cannot be held liable directly or indirectly for the public acts
of the United States as a sovereign." Id., at 385.The Government argues that "[t]he relevant question
[under these cases] is whether the impact [of governmentalaction] . . . is caused by a law enacted to govern regulatory
policy and to advance the general welfare." Brief forUnited States 45. This understanding assumes that the
dual characters of Government as contractor and legislatorare never "fused" (within the meaning of

Horowitz) so longas the object of the statute is regulatory and meant to accomplish some public good. That is, on the Government's read-ing, a regulatory object is proof against treating the legislature as having acted to avoid the Government's contractualobligations, in which event the sovereign acts defense would

Opinion of Souter, J.
not be applicable. But the Government's position is open toserious objection.

As an initial matter, we have already expressed our doubtthat a workable line can be drawn between the Government's
"regulatory" and "nonregulatory" capacities. In the presentcase, the Government chose to regulate capital reserves to
protect FSLIC's insurance fund, much as any insurer mightimpose restrictions on an insured as a condition of the policy.
The regulation thus protected the Government in its capac-ity analogous to a private insurer, the same capacity in which
it entered into supervisory merger agreements to convertsome of its financial insurance obligations into responsibilities of private entrepreneurs. In this respect, the super-visory mergers bear some analogy to private contracts for
reinsurance.37 On the other hand, there is no question thatthrift regulation is, in fact, regulation, and that both the supervisory mergers of the 1980's and the subsequent passage
of FIRREA were meant to advance a broader public interest. The inescapable conclusion from all of this is that theGovernment's "regulatory" and "nonregulatory" capacities

were fused in the instances under consideration, and wesuspect that such fusion will be so common in the modern
regulatory state as to leave a criterion of "regulation" with-out much use in defining the scope of the sovereign acts
doctrine.38

37 Nor is there any substance to the claim that these were contracts that
only the Government could make. The regulatory capital or net worth
requirements at issue applied only to thrifts choosing to carry federal deposit insurance, see Federal Home Loan Bank System, A Guide to the
Federal Home Loan Bank System 69 (5th ed. 1987), and institutions choosing to self-insure or to seek private insurance elsewhere would have been
free to make similar agreements with private insurers.

38 Moreover, if the dissent were correct that the sovereign acts doctrine

permits the Government to abrogate its contractual commitments in "regulatory" cases even where it simply sought to avoid contracts it had come
to regret, then the Government's sovereign contracting power would be
of very little use in this broad sphere of public activity. We rejected a

895Cite as: 518 U. S. 839 (1996)
Opinion of Souter, J.
An even more serious objection is that allowing the Gov-ernment to avoid contractual liability merely by passing

any "regulatory statute" would flout the general principlethat, "[w]hen the United States enters into contract relations, its rights and duties therein are governed generally
by the law applicable to contracts between private indi-viduals."

Lynch v. United States, 292 U. S., at 579.39 Careful attention to the cases shows that the sovereign actsdoctrine was meant to serve this principle, not undermine

it. In Horowitz, for example, if the defendant had beena private shipper, it would have been entitled to assert
the common-law defense of impossibility of performanceagainst Horowitz's claim for breach. Although that defense
is traditionally unavailable where the barrier to performancearises from the act of the party seeking discharge, see Restatement (Second) of Contracts $ 261; 2 E. Farnsworth, Contracts $ 9.6, p. 551 (1990); cf. W. R. Grace & Co. v. Rubber
Workers, 461 U. S. 757, 767-768, n. 10 (1983), Horowitz held
that the "public and general" acts of the sovereign are not

virtually identical argument in Perry v. United States, 294 U. S. 330 (1935),
in which Congress had passed a resolution regulating the payment of obligations in gold. We held that the law could not be applied to the Government's own obligations, noting that "the right to make binding obligations
is a competence attaching to sovereignty." Id., at 353.

attributable to the Government as contractor so as to barthe Government's right to discharge. The sovereign acts

doctrine thus balances the Government's need for freedom tolegislate with its obligation to honor its contracts by asking
whether the sovereign act is properly attributable to theGovernment as contractor. If the answer is no, the Government's defense to liability depends on the answer to thefurther question, whether that act would otherwise release
the Government from liability under ordinary principles ofcontract law.

40 Neither question can be answered in the

Government's favor here. A

If the Government is to be treated like other contractors,some line has to be drawn in situations like the one before
us between regulatory legislation that is relatively free ofGovernment self-interest and therefore cognizable for the
purpose of a legal impossibility defense and, on the otherhand, statutes tainted by a governmental object of self-relief.
Such an object is not necessarily inconsistent with a publicpurpose, of course, and when we speak of governmental
"self-interest," we simply mean to identify instances in whichthe Government seeks to shift the costs of meeting its legitimate public responsibilities to private parties. Cf. Arm-strong v. United States, 364 U. S., at 49 (The Government
may not "forc[e] some people alone to bear public burdens

40 See Jones v. United States, 1 Ct. Cl. 383, 385 (1865) ("Wherever the
public and private acts of the government seem to commingle, a citizen or
corporate body must by supposition be substituted in its place, and then
the question be determined whether the action will lie against the supposed defendant"); O'Neill v. United States, 231 Ct. Cl. 823, 826 (1982)
(sovereign acts doctrine applies where, "[w]ere [the] contracts exclusively
between private parties, the party hurt by such governing action could
not claim compensation from the other party for the governing action").
The dissent ignores these statements (including the statement from Jones,
from which case Horowitz drew its reasoning literally verbatim), when it
says, post, at 931, that the sovereign acts cases do not emphasize the need
to treat the government-as-contractor the same as a private party.

which . . . should be borne by the public as a whole").
Hence, while the Government might legitimately conclude
that a given contractual commitment was no longer in the
public interest, a government seeking relief from such commitments through legislation would obviously not be in a
position comparable to that of the private contractor who
willy-nilly was barred by law from performance. There
would be, then, good reason in such circumstance to find the
regulatory and contractual characters of the Government
fused together, in Horowitz's terms, so that the Government
should not have the benefit of the defense.41

Horowitz's criterion of "public and general act" thus reflects the traditional "rule of law" assumption that generality
in the terms by which the use of power is authorized will
tend to guard against its misuse to burden or benefit the few
unjustifiably.42 See, e. g., Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S.
516, 535-536 (1884) ("Law . . . must be not a special rule for
a particular person or a particular case, but . . . `[t]he general
law . . .' so `that every citizen shall hold his life, liberty, property and immunities under the protection of the general

41 Our Contract Clause cases have demonstrated a similar concern with
governmental self-interest by recognizing that "complete deference to a
legislative assessment of reasonableness and necessity is not appropriate
because the State's self-interest is at stake." United States Trust Co. of
N. Y. v. New Jersey, 431 U. S. 1, 26 (1977); see also Energy Reserves Group,
Inc. v. Kansas Power & Light Co., 459 U. S. 400, 412-413, and n. 14 (1983)
(noting that a stricter level of scrutiny applies under the Contract Clause
when a State alters its own contractual obligations); cf. Perry, supra, at
350-351 (drawing a "clear distinction" between Congress's power over private contracts and "the power of the Congress to alter or repudiate the
substance of its own engagements").

42 The generality requirement will almost always be met where, as in

Deming, the governmental action "bears upon [the Government's contract]
as it bears upon all similar contracts between citizens." Deming v.
United States, 1 Ct. Cl. 190, 191 (1865). Deming is less helpful, however,
in cases where, as here, the public contracts at issue have no obvious
private analogs.

rules which govern society' " (citation omitted)).43 Hence,governmental action will not be held against the Government for purposes of the impossibility defense so long as theaction's impact upon public contracts is, as in Horowitz,
merely incidental to the accomplishment of a broader gov-ernmental objective. See

O'Neill v. United States, 231 Ct.Cl. 823, 826 (1982) (noting that the sovereign acts doctrine

recognizes that "the Government's actions, otherwise legal,will occasionally incidentally impair the performance of contracts").44 The greater the Government's self-interest, how-ever, the more suspect becomes the claim that its private

contracting partners ought to bear the financial burden ofthe Government's own improvidence, and where a substantial part of the impact of the Government's action renderingperformance impossible falls on its own contractual obligations, the defense will be unavailable. Cf. Sun Oil Co. v.
United States, 215 Ct. Cl. 716, 768, 572 F. 2d 786, 817 (1978)(rejecting sovereign acts defense where the Secretary of the

Interior's actions were " `directed principally and primarilyat plaintiffs' contractual right' ").

45

43 The dissent accuses us of transplanting this due process principle into
alien soil, see post, at 931-932. But this Court did not even wait until the
Term following Hurtado before applying its principle of generality to a
case that, like this one, involved the deprivation of property rights. See
Hagar v. Reclamation Dist. No. 108, 111 U. S. 701, 708 (1884). More importantly, it would be surprising indeed if the sovereign acts doctrine,
resting on the inherent nature of sovereignty, were not shaped by fundamental principles about how sovereigns ought to behave.

44 See also Speidel, 51 Geo. L. J., at 539-540 (observing that "the commonly expressed conditions to the availability of the sovereign acts defense" are not only that "the act . . . must have been `public and general,' "
but also that "the damage to the contractor must have been caused indirectly"); cf. Exxon Corp. v. Eagerton, 462 U. S. 176, 191-192 (1983) (distinguishing between direct and incidental impairments under the Contract
Clause).

45 Cf. also Resolution Trust Corporation v. Federal Savings and Loan

Insurance Corporation, 25 F. 3d 1493, 1501 (CA10 1994) ("The limits of

The dissent would adopt a different rule that the Government's dual roles of contractor and sovereign may never be
treated as fused, relying upon Deming's pronouncement that
" `[t]he United States as a contractor are not responsible for
the United States as a lawgiver.' " Post, at 931 (quoting 1
Ct. Cl., at 191). But that view would simply eliminate the
"public and general" requirement, which presupposes that
the Government's capacities must be treated as fused when
the Government acts in a nongeneral way. Deming itself
twice refers to the "general" quality of the enactment at
issue, 1 Ct. Cl., at 191, and notes that "[t]he statute bears
upon [the governmental contract] as it bears upon all similar
contracts between citizens, and affects it in no other way."
Ibid. At the other extreme, of course, it is clear that any
benefit at all to the Government will not disqualify an act as
"public and general"; the silk embargo in Horowitz, for example, had the incidental effect of releasing the Government
from its contractual obligation to transport Mr. Horowitz's
shipment. Our holding that a governmental act will not be
public and general if it has the substantial effect of releasing
the Government from its contractual obligations strikes a
middle course between these two extremes.46

government's failure to perform is the result of legislation targeting a
class of contracts to which it is a party"); South Louisiana Grain Services,
Inc. v. United States, 1 Cl. Ct. 281, 287, n. 6 (1982) (rejecting sovereign
acts defense where the Government agency's actions "were directed specifically at plaintiff's alleged contract performance"). Despite the dissent's predictions, the sun is not, in fact, likely to set on the sovereign
acts doctrine. While an increase in regulation by contract will produce
examples of the "fusion" that bars the defense, we may expect that other
sovereign activity will continue to occasion the sovereign acts defense in
cases of incidental effect.

46 A different intermediate position would be possible, at least in theory.

under Horowitz if its predominant purpose or effect was avoidance of the

In the present case, it is impossible to attribute the exculpatory "public and general" character to FIRREA. Although we have not been told the dollar value of the relief
the Government would obtain if insulated from liability
under contracts such as these, the attention given to the regulatory contracts prior to passage of FIRREA shows that a
substantial effect on governmental contracts is certain. The
statute not only had the purpose of eliminating the very accounting gimmicks that acquiring thrifts had been promised,
but the specific object of abrogating enough of the acquisition contracts as to make that consequence of the legislation
a focal point of the congressional debate.47 Opponents of
FIRREA's new capital requirements complained that "[i]n
its present form, [FIRREA] would abrogate written agreepurely private contracts persuades us that this test would prove very difficult to apply.

47 We note that whether or not Congress intended to abrogate supervisory merger agreements providing that supervisory goodwill would count
toward regulatory capital requirements has been the subject of extensive
litigation in the Courts of Appeals, and that every Circuit to consider the
issue has concluded that Congress did so intend. See Transohio Sav.

This evidence of intense concern with contracts like theones before us suffices to show that FIRREA had the

substantial effect of releasing the Government from its
own contractual obligations. Congress obviously expectedFIRREA to have such an effect, and in the absence of any

evidence to the contrary we accept its factual judgment thatthis would be so.

50 Nor is Congress's own judgment neutralized by the fact, emphasized by the Government, thatFIRREA did not formally target particular transactions.

Legislation can almost always be written in a formally gen49 See also House Report, at 545 (Supplemental Views of Reps. Schumer,
Morrison, Roukema, Gonzalez, Vento, McMillen, and Hoagland) ("[A]n
overriding public policy would be jeopardized by the continued adherence
to arrangements which were blithely entered into by the FSLIC"); 135

Bank Board and FSLIC insurance fund managers entered into bad deals--
I might even call them steals"); id., at 11789 (statement of Rep. Saxton)
("In short[,] goodwill agreements were a mistake and as the saying goes
. . . `Two wrongs don't make a right' "). These proponents defeated two
amendments to FIRREA, proposed by Reps. Quillen and Hyde, which
would have given thrifts that had received capital forbearances from thrift
regulators varying degrees of protection from the new rules. See Transohio Sav. Bank v. Director, Office of Thrift Supervision, supra, at 616-
617; see also 135 Cong. Rec. 12068 (1989) (statement of Rep. Price) ("[T]he
proponents of [the Hyde] amendment say a `Deal is a Deal' . . . . But to
claim that Congress can never change a regulator's decision . . . in the
future is simply not tenable"); Franklin Federal Sav. Bank v. Director,
Office of Thrift Supervision, supra, at 1340-1341 (reviewing the House
debate and concluding that "[n]obody expressed the view that FIRREA
did not abrogate forbearance agreements regarding supervisory goodwill"
(emphasis in original)).

50 Despite the claims of the dissent, our test does not turn upon "some

sort of legislative intent," post, at 933. Rather, we view Congress's expectation that the Government's own obligations would be heavily affected
simply as good evidence that this was, indeed, the case.

eral way, and the want of an identified target is not much
security when a measure's impact nonetheless falls substantially upon the Government's contracting partners. For like
reason, it does not answer the legislative record to insist,
as the Government does, that the congressional focus is
irrelevant because the broad purpose of FIRREA was to
"advance the general welfare." Brief for United States 45.
We assume nothing less of all congressional action, with
the result that an intent to benefit the public can no more
serve as a criterion of a "public and general" sovereign act
than its regulatory character can.51 While our limited enquiry into the background and evolution of the thrift crisis
leaves us with the understanding that Congress acted to protect the public in the FIRREA legislation, the extent to
which this reform relieved the Government of its own contractual obligations precludes a finding that the statute is a
"public and general" act for purposes of the sovereign acts
defense.52

51 We have, indeed, had to reject a variant of this argument before. See
Lynch v. United States, 292 U. S. 571, 580 (1934) (acknowledging a public
need for governmental economy, but holding that "[t]o abrogate contracts,
in the attempt to lessen governmental expenditure, would be not the practice of economy, but an act of repudiation"); see also Speidel, 51 Geo. L. J.,
at 522 (noting that even when "the Government's acts are motivated or
required by public necessity . . . [t]he few decisions on point seem to reject
public convenience or necessity as a defense, particularly where [the Government's action] directly alters the terms of the contract").

52 The dissent contends that FIRREA must be a "public and general"

act because it "occupies 372 pages in the Statutes at Large, and under 12
substantive titles contains more than 150 numbered sections." Post, at
934. But any act of repudiation can be buried in a larger piece of legislation, and if that is enough to save it then the Government's contracting
power will not count for much. To the extent that The Chief Justice
relies on the fact that FIRREA's core capital requirements applied to all
thrift institutions, we note that neither he nor the Government has provided any indication of the relative incidence of the new statute in requiring capital increases for thrifts subject to regulatory agreements affecting
capital and those not so subject.

Even if FIRREA were to qualify as "public and general,"however, other fundamental reasons would leave the sovereign acts doctrine inadequate to excuse the Government'sbreach of these contracts. As

Horowitz makes clear, thatdefense simply relieves the Government as contractor from

the traditional blanket rule that a contracting party may notobtain discharge if its own act rendered performance impossible. But even if the Government stands in the place of aprivate party with respect to "public and general" sovereign
acts, it does not follow that discharge will always be avail-able, for the common-law doctrine of impossibility imposes
additional requirements before a party may avoid liabilityfor breach. As the Restatement puts it,

"[w]here, after a contract is made, a party's performanceis made impracticable without his fault by the occurrence of an event the non-occurrence of which was abasic assumption on which the contract was made, his
duty to render that performance is discharged, unlessthe language or the circumstances indicate the contrary." Restatement (Second) of Contracts $ 261.
See also 2 Farnsworth on Contracts $ 9.6, at 543-544 (listingfour elements of the impossibility defense). Thus, since the

object of the sovereign acts defense is to place the Govern-ment as contractor on par with a private contractor in the
same circumstances, Horowitz, 267 U. S., at 461, the Govern-ment, like any other defending party in a contract action,
must show that the passage of the statute rendering its per-formance impossible was an event contrary to the basic assumptions on which the parties agreed, and must ultimatelyshow that the language or circumstances do not indicate that
the Government should be liable in any case. While we donot say that these conditions can never be satisfied when
the Government contracts with participants in a regulatedindustry for particular regulatory treatment, we find that

the Government as such a contractor has not satisfied theconditions for discharge in the present case.

1
For a successful impossibility defense the Governmentwould have to show that the nonoccurrence of regulatory

amendment was a basic assumption of these contracts. See,
e. g., Restatement (Second) of Contracts $ 261; 2 Farnsworth,supra, $ 9.6, at 549-550. The premise of this requirement is

that the parties will have bargained with respect to any risksthat are both within their contemplation and central to the
substance of the contract; as Justice Traynor said, "[i]f [therisk] was foreseeable there should have been provision for it
in the contract, and the absence of such a provision givesrise to the inference that the risk was assumed."

Opinion of Souter, J.
inference is particularly compelling, where, as here, the contract provides for particular regulatory treatment (and, a
fortiori, allocates the risk of regulatory change). Such an
agreement reflects the inescapable recognition that regulated industries in the modern world do not live under the
law of the Medes and the Persians, and the very fact that
such a contract is made at all is at odds with any assumption
of regulatory stasis. In this particular case, whether or not
the reach of the FIRREA reforms was anticipated by the
parties, there is no doubt that some changes in the regulatory structure governing thrift capital reserves were both
foreseeable and likely when these parties contracted with
the Government, as even the Government agrees. It says
in its brief to this Court that "in light of the frequency with
which federal capital requirements had changed in the past
. . . , it would have been unreasonable for Glendale, FSLIC,
or the Bank Board to expect or rely upon the fact that those
requirements would remain unchanged." Brief for United
States 26; see also id., at 3, n. 1 (listing the changes).54 The
Federal Circuit panel in this case likewise found that the
regulatory capital requirements "have been the subject of

within the contemplation of both parties when they entered into the contract. If so, the risk should not fairly be thrown upon the promisor").
Although foreseeability is generally a relevant, but not dispositive, factor,
see 2 E. Farnsworth, Contracts $ 9.6, at 555-556; Opera Company of Boston, Inc. v. Wolf Trap Foundation for the Performing Arts, 817 F. 2d
1094, 1101 (CA4 1987), there is no reason to look further where, as here,
the risk was foreseen to be more than minimally likely, went to the central
purpose of the contract, and could easily have been allocated in a different
manner had the parties chosen to do so, see id., at 1099-1102; 18 Williston
on Contracts, supra, $ 1953, at 119.

54 The Government confirmed this point at oral argument. When asked

whether FIRREA's tightening of the regulatory capital standards was
"exactly the event that the parties assumed might happen when they made
their contracts," the Government responded, "Exactly. Congress had
changed capital standards many times over the years." Tr. of Oral Arg. 9.

55

Given these fluctuations, and given the fact that a single
modification of the applicable regulations could, and ultimately did, eliminate virtually all of the consideration provided by the Government in these transactions, it would be
absurd to say that the nonoccurrence of a change in the regulatory capital rules was a basic assumption upon which these
contracts were made. See, e. g., Moncrief v. Williston
Basin Interstate Pipeline Co., 880 F. Supp. 1495, 1508 (Wyo.
1995); Vollmar v. CSX Transportation, Inc., 705 F. Supp.
1154, 1176 (ED Va. 1989), aff 'd, 898 F. 2d 413 (CA4 1990).

2
Finally, any governmental contract that not only deals
with regulatory change but allocates the risk of its occurrence will, by definition, fail the further condition of a successful impossibility defense, for it will indeed indicate that
the parties' agreement was not meant to be rendered nugatory by a change in the regulatory law. See Restatement

55 See, e. g., Garn-St Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, Pub.
L. 97-320, 96 Stat. 1469 (eliminating any fixed limits to Bank Board discretion in setting reserve requirements); Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-221, 94 Stat. 132, 160

reserve ratio from 4 to 3 percent); id., at 31859 (excluding certain "contraasset" accounts from reserve calculations); id., at 52961 (permitting thrifts

that because "[c]apital requirements have been an evolving part of the
regulatory scheme since its inception," the Bank Board "would have expected changes in statutory requirements, including capital requirements"); Carteret Sav. Bank v. Office of Thrift Supervision, 963 F. 2d, at
581 (observing that "[i]n the massively regulated banking industry, . . . the

(Second) of Contracts $ 261 (no impossibility defense wherethe "language or the circumstances" indicate allocation of the

risk to the party seeking discharge).56 The mere fact thatthe Government's contracting agencies (like the Bank Board
and FSLIC) could not themselves preclude Congress from
changing the regulatory rules does not, of course, stand in
the way of concluding that those agencies assumed the risk
of such change, for determining the consequences of legal
change was the point of the agreements. It is, after all, not
uncommon for a contracting party to assume the risk of an
event he cannot control,57 even when that party is an agent
of the Government. As the Federal Circuit has recognized,
"[Government] contracts routinely include provisions shifting
financial responsibility to the Government for events which
might occur in the future. That some of these events may
be triggered by sovereign government action does not render the relevant contractual provisions any less binding than
those which contemplate third party acts, inclement weather

to certain constraints, "[t]he contracting parties' chosen allocation of risk"
should always be honored as the most efficient one possible).

himself or itself to perform things which subsequently become impossible,
or to pay damages for the nonperformance"). This is no less true where
the event that renders performance impossible is a change in the governing law. See, e. g., 4 R. Anderson, Anderson on the Uniform Commercial
Code $ 2-615:34, p. 286 (3d ed. 1983) ("Often in regard to impossibility due

and other force majeure." Hughes Communications Galaxy, Inc. v. United States, 998 F. 2d 953, 958-959 (CA Fed.
1993).58As to each of the contracts before us, our agreement with

the conclusions of the Court of Federal Claims and the Federal Circuit forecloses any defense of legal impossibility, for
those courts found that the Bank Board resolutions, Forbearance Letters, and other documents setting forth the accounting treatment to be accorded supervisory goodwill generated
by the transactions were not mere statements of thencurrent regulatory policy, but in each instance were terms in
an allocation of risk of regulatory change that was essential
to the contract between the parties. See supra, at 861-864.
Given that the parties went to considerable lengths in procuring necessary documents and drafting broad integration
clauses to incorporate their terms into the contract itself, the
Government's suggestion that the parties meant to say only

would, indeed, have been madness for respondents to haveengaged in these transactions with no more protection than
the Government's reading would have given them, for thevery existence of their institutions would then have been in
jeopardy from the moment their agreements were signed.

We affirm the Federal Circuit's ruling that the UnitedStates is liable to respondents for breach of contract. Because the Court of Federal Claims has not yet determinedthe appropriate measure or amount of damages in this case,
we remand for further proceedings.

It is so ordered.

Justice Breyer, concurring.
I join the principal opinion because, in my view, that opin-ion is basically consistent with the following understanding

of what the dissent and the Government call the "unmistaka-bility doctrine." The doctrine appears in the language of
earlier cases, where the Court states that

"sovereign power, even when unexercised, is an endur-ing presence that governs all contracts subject to the

sovereign's jurisdiction, and will remain intact unless
surrendered in unmistakable terms." Merrion v. Jica-rilla Apache Tribe, 455 U. S. 130, 148 (1982) (emphasis

added).
See also United States v. Cherokee Nation of Okla., 480 U. S.700, 706-707 (1987); Bowen v. Public Agencies Opposed to

Social Security Entrapment, 477 U. S. 41, 52-53 (1986).The Government and the dissent believe that this language
normally shields the Government from contract liabilitywhere a change in the law prevents it from carrying out its
side of the bargain. In my view, however, this language,

911Cite as: 518 U. S. 839 (1996)
Breyer, J., concurring
while perhaps appropriate in the circumstances of the casesin which it appears, was not intended to displace the rules of

contract interpretation applicable to the Government as wellas private contractors in numerous ordinary cases, and in
certain unusual cases, such as this one. Primarily for reasons explained in the principal opinion, this doctrine doesnot shield the Government from liability here.

Both common sense and precedent make clear that an "un-mistakable" promise to bear the risk of a change in the law
is not required in every circumstance in which a privateparty seeks contract damages from the Government. Imagine, for example, that the General Services Administration
or the Department of Defense were to enter into a garden
variety contract to sell a surplus commodity such as oil,
under circumstances where (1) the time of shipment is critically important, (2) the parties are aware that pending environmental legislation could prevent the shipment, and (3) the
fair inference from the circumstances is that if the environmental legislation occurs and prevents shipment, a private
seller would incur liability for failure to ship on time.

Under ordinary principles of contract law, one would construe the contract in terms of the parties' intent, as revealed
by language and circumstance. See The Binghamton
Bridge, 3 Wall. 51, 74 (1866) ("All contracts are to be construed to accomplish the intention of the parties"); Restatement (Second) of Contracts $ 202(1) (1979) ("Words and other
conduct are interpreted in the light of all the circumstances,
and if the principal purpose of the parties is ascertainable it
is given great weight"). If the language and circumstances
showed that the parties intended the seller to bear the risk
of a performance-defeating change in the law, the seller
would have to pay damages. See id., $ 261 (no liability
where "a party's performance is made impracticable without
his fault by the occurrence of an event [i. e., the new environmental regulation] the non-occurrence of which was a basic
assumption on which the contract was made . . . unless the

language or the circumstances indicate the contrary" (em-phasis added)).

The Court has often said, as a general matter, that the"rights and duties" contained in a Government contract "are
governed generally by the law applicable to contracts between private individuals." Lynch v. United States, 292U. S. 571, 579 (1934); see

Perry v. United States, 294 U. S.
330, 352 (1935) (same); Sinking Fund Cases, 99 U. S. 700,719 (1879) ("The United States are as much bound by their

contracts as are individuals. If they repudiate their obliga-tions, it is as much repudiation, with all the wrong and reproach that term implies, as it would be if the repudiator had
been a State or a municipality or a citizen"); United States
v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128, 144 (1872) (same); United States v.
Gibbons, 109 U. S. 200, 203-204 (1883) (where contract language "susceptible of two meanings," Government's broader
obligation was "sufficiently plain" from "the circumstances
attending the transaction"); see also, e. g., Russell v. Sebastian, 233 U. S. 195, 205 (1914) (public grants to be given
a "fair and reasonable" interpretation that gives effect to
what it "satisfactorily appears" the government intended to
convey).

The Court has also indicated that similar principles apply
in certain cases where courts have had to determine whether
or not a government seller is liable involving contracts resembling the ones before us. In Lynch, supra, for example,
the Court held that the Federal Government must compensate holders of "war risk insurance" contracts, the promises
of which it had abrogated through postcontract legislation.
In the "gold clause" case, Perry, supra, the Court held that
subsequent legislation could not abrogate a Government
bond's promises to pay principal and interest in gold. In
neither case did the Court suggest that an "unmistakable"
promise, beyond that discernible using ordinary principles of
contract interpretation, was necessary before liability could
be imposed on the Government.

This approach is unsurprising, for in practical terms it en-sures that the government is able to obtain needed goods

and services from parties who might otherwise, quite rightly,be unwilling to undertake the risk of government contracting. See, e. g., Detroit v. Detroit Citizens' Street R. Co., 184
U. S. 368, 384 (1902) (rejecting as "hardly . . . credible" thecity's suggestion that the fare rate agreed on with railroad

company, which "amounted to a contract," would be "subjectto change from time to time" at the city's pleasure);

Murray
v. Charleston, 96 U. S. 432, 445 (1878) (A government con-tract "should be regarded as an assurance that [a sovereign

right to withhold payment] will not be exercised. A promise
to pay, with a reserved right to deny or change the effect of
the promise, is an absurdity"); New Jersey v. Yard, 95 U. S.
104, 116-117 (1877) (same). This is not to say that the government is always treated just like a private party. The
simple fact that it is the government may well change the
underlying circumstances, leading to a different inference as
to the parties' likely intent--say, making it far less likely
that they intend to make a promise that will oblige the government to hold private parties harmless in the event of a
change in the law. But to say this is to apply, not to disregard, the ordinary rule of contract law.

This approach is also consistent with congressional intent,
as revealed in Congress' determination to permit, under the
Tucker Act, awards of damages and other relief against the
United States for "any claim . . . founded . . . upon any
express or implied contract." 28 U. S. C. $ 1491(a)(1). The
thrifts invoked this provision in their complaints as the basis
for jurisdiction to adjudicate their claims in the lower courts,
see App. 8 (Winstar), 137 (Statesman), and 546 (Glendale);
and, as the principal opinion explains, ante, at 858-859, the
lower courts held that each proved the existence of an express promise by the Government to grant them particular
regulatory treatment for a period of years. For my purposes, the provision is relevant only to show that Congress

Breyer, J., concurring
clearly contemplated the award of damages for breachagainst the Government in some contexts where the Government's promises are far from "unmistakable" as the Govern-ment defines that term. While in this case, the lower courts
found the promises to be "express," this Court has in other
cases interpreted $ 1491(a)(1) to permit claims for reliefbased on an "implied in fact" promise, which can be a promise "founded upon a meeting of minds, which, although notembodied in an express contract, is inferred, as a fact, from
conduct of the parties showing, in the light of the surround-ing circumstances, their tacit understanding."

Baltimore &
Ohio R. Co. v. United States, 261 U. S. 592, 597 (1923); see
Hercules, Inc. v. United States, 516 U. S. 417, 424 (1996).
These interpretations, as well as the statutory language,
lend further support to the view that ordinary government
contracts are typically governed by the rules applicable to
contracts between private parties.

There are, moreover, at least two good reasons to think
that the cases containing special language of "unmistakability" do not, as the Government suggests, impose an additional "clear-statement" rule, see Brief for United States 19,
that shields the Government from liability here. First, it is
not clear that the "unmistakability" language was determinative of the outcome in those cases. In two of the three cases
in which that language appears (and several of the older
cases from which it is derived), the private parties claimed
that the sovereign had effectively promised not to change
the law in an area of law not mentioned in the contract at
issue. In Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U. S., at
148, for example, the contracts were leases by a sovereign
Indian Tribe to private parties of rights to extract oil and
gas from tribal lands. The private party claimed that the
leases contained an implicit waiver of the power to impose a
severance tax on the oil and gas. The Court pointed out
that the leases said nothing about taxes, thereby requiring
an inference of intent from "silence." Ibid. Though the

opinion contains language of "unmistakability," the Courtwas not called upon in

Merrion to decide whether a sovereign's promise not to change the law (or to pay damages if itdid) was clear enough to justify liability, because there was

no evidence of any such promise in the "contracts" in that
case. Yet, that is the effect the Government asks us to givethe "unmistakability" language in

Merrion here.
The Court in Merrion cited Home Building & Loan Assn.v.

Blaisdell, 290 U. S. 398 (1934), and St. Louis v. United
Railways Co., 210 U. S. 266 (1908), which in turn referred toa line of cases in which the Court held that a government's

grant of a bank charter did not carry with it a promise not
to tax the bank unless expressed "in terms too plain to be
mistaken." Jefferson Branch Bank v. Skelly, 1 Black 436,
446 (1862). These cases illustrate the same point made
above: Where a state-granted charter, or franchise agreement, did not implicate a promise not to tax, the Court held
that no such promise was made. See Providence Bank v.
Billings, 4 Pet. 514, 560, 561 (1830) (promise not to tax
"ought not to be presumed" where "deliberate purpose of the
state to abandon" power to tax "does not appear"); St. Louis,
supra, at 274 (right to tax "still exists unless there is a distinct agreement, clearly expressed, that the sums to be paid
are in lieu of all such exactions"). But, where the sovereign
had made an express promise not to tax, the Court gave that
promise its intended effect. See Jefferson, supra, at 450;
Piqua Branch of State Bank of Ohio v. Knoop, 16 How. 369,
378 (1854) (same); New Jersey v. Yard, supra, at 115-117
(same).

Similarly, in the second "unmistakability" case, United
States v. Cherokee Nation of Okla., 480 U. S., at 706-707, a
Government treaty granted the Tribe title to a riverbed, but
it said nothing about the Government's pre-existing right to
navigate the river. The Court held that it was most unlikely
that a treaty silent on the matter would have conveyed the
Government's navigational rights to the Tribe, particularly

518US3$90q 05-29-99 19:20:29 PAGES OPINPGT
916 UNITED STATES v. WINSTAR CORP.

Breyer, J., concurring
since "[t]he parties . . . clearly understood that the [Govern-ment's] navigational" rights were "dominant no matter how

the question of riverbed ownership was resolved." Id., at706.

The remaining case, Bowen v. Public Agencies Opposed to
Social Security Entrapment, 477 U. S. 41 (1986), concernedan alleged promise closely related to the subject matter of

the contract. A State and several state agencies claimedthat Congress, in enacting a statute that gave States flexibility to include or withdraw certain employees from a fed-eral social security program, promised

not to change that
"withdrawal" flexibility. But in Bowen, the statute itself
expressly reserved to Congress the right to "alter, amend,
or repeal" any of the statute's provisions. See id., at 55.
Hence, it is not surprising to find language in Bowen to the
effect that other circumstances would have to be "unmistakable" before the Court could find a congressional promise to
the contrary.

A second reason to doubt the Government's interpretation
of the "unmistakability" language is that, in all these cases,
the language was directed at the claim that the sovereign
had made a broad promise not to legislate, or otherwise to
exercise its sovereign powers. Even in the cases in which
damages were sought (e. g., Bowen, Cherokee Nation), the
Court treated the claimed promise as a promise not to
change the law, rather than as the kind of promise more normally at issue in contract cases, including this one--namely,
a promise that obliges the government to hold a party harmless from a change in the law that the government remains
free to make. See, e. g., Bowen, supra, at 52 (lower court
decision "effectively . . . forbid[s] Congress to amend a provision of the Social Security Act"); Cherokee Nation, supra, at
707 (refusing to conclude that the Tribe "gained an exemption from the [Government's navigational] servitude simply
because it received title to the riverbed interests"). It is
difficult to believe that the Court intended its "unmistaka518US3$90q 05-29-99 19:20:29 PAGES OPINPGT

Breyer, J., concurring
bility" language in these unusual cases to disable futurecourts from inferring, from language and circumstance under

ordinary contract principles, a more narrow promise in moretypical cases--say, a promise not to abrogate, or to restrict
severely through legislation and without compensation, the
very right that a sovereign explicitly granted by contract(

e. g., the right to drill for oil, or to use the riverbed).

The Government attempts to answer this objection to itsreading of the "unmistakability" language by arguing that

any award of "substantial damages" against the governmentfor breach of contract through a change in the law "unquestionably carries the danger that needed future regulatory
action will be deterred," and thus amounts to an infringement on sovereignty requiring an "unmistakable" promise.
Brief for Petitioner 21. But this rationale has no logical
stopping point. See, e. g., United States Trust Co. of N. Y.
v. New Jersey, 431 U. S. 1, 24 (1977) ("Any financial obligation
could be regarded in theory as a relinquishment of the
State's spending power, since money spent to repay debts is
not available for other purposes. . . . Notwithstanding these
effects, the Court has regularly held that the States are
bound by their debt contracts"). It is difficult to see how
the Court could, in a principled fashion, apply the Government's rule in this case without also making it applicable to
the ordinary contract case (like the hypothetical sale of oil)
which, for the reasons explained above, are properly governed by ordinary principles of contract law. To draw the
line--i. e., to apply a more stringent rule of contract interpretation--based only on the amount of money at stake, and
therefore (in the Government's terms) the degree to which
future exercises of sovereign authority may be deterred,
seems unsatisfactory. As the Government acknowledges,
see Brief for United States 41, n. 34, this Court has previously rejected the argument that Congress has "the power
to repudiate its own debts, which constitute `property' to the
lender, simply in order to save money." Bowen, supra, at

Breyer, J., concurring
55 (citing Perry, 294 U. S., at 350-351, and Lynch, 292 U. S.,at 576-577).

In sum, these two factors, along with the general principlethat the government is ordinarily treated like a private
party when it enters into contracts, means that the "unmistakability" language might simply have underscored the spe-cial circumstances that would have been required to convince

the Court of the existence of the claimed promise in the casesbefore it. At most, the language might have grown out of
unique features of sovereignty, believed present in thosecases, which, for reasons of policy, might have made appropriate a special caution in implying the claimed promise.
But, I do not believe that language was meant to establish
an "unmistakability" rule that controls more ordinary contracts, or that controls the outcome here.

The Government attempts to show that such special circumstances, warranting application of an unmistakability
principle, are present in this case. To be sure, it might seem
unlikely, in the abstract, that the Government would have
intended to make a binding promise that would oblige it to
hold the thrifts harmless from the effects of future regulation (or legislation) in such a high-risk, highly regulated context as the accounting practices of failing savings and loans.
But, as the principal opinion's careful examination of the
circumstances reveals, that is exactly what the Government
did. The thrifts demonstrate that specific promises were
made to accord them particular regulatory treatment for a
period of years, which, when abrogated by subsequent legislation, rendered the Government liable for breach of contract. These promises affect only those thrifts with preexisting contracts of a certain kind. They are promises that
the banks seek to infer from the explicit language of the contracts, not ones they read into contracts silent on the matter.
And, there is no special policy reason related to sovereignty
which would justify applying an "unmistakability" principle
here. For these reasons, I join the principal opinion.

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Kennedy and
Justice Thomas join, concurring in the judgment.

I agree with the principal opinion that the contracts atissue in this case gave rise to an obligation on the part of

the Government to afford respondents favorable accountingtreatment, and that the contracts were broken by the Government's discontinuation of that favorable treatment, as re-quired by FIRREA, 12 U. S. C. $ 1464(t). My reasons for
rejecting the Government's defenses to this contract actionare, however, quite different from the principal opinion's, so
I must write separately to state briefly the basis for my vote.The principal opinion dispenses with three of the four
"sovereign" defenses raised by the Government simply bycharacterizing the contracts at issue as "risk-shifting agreements" that amount to nothing more than "promises by theGovernment to insure [respondents] against any losses arising from future regulatory change." Ante, at 881. Thusunderstood, the principal opinion explains, the contracts purport, not to constrain the exercise of sovereign power, butonly to make the exercise of that power an event resulting
in liability for the Government--with the consequence that
the peculiarly sovereign defenses raised by the Governmentare simply inapplicable. This approach has several difficulties, the first being that it has no basis in our cases, whichhave not made the availability of these sovereign defenses
(as opposed to their validity on the merits) depend upon thenature of the contract at issue. But in any event, it is questionable whether, even as a matter of normal contract law,the exercise in contract characterization in which the principal opinion engages is really valid. Virtually every contract
operates, not as a guarantee of particular future conduct, butas an assumption of liability in the event of nonperformance:

"The duty to keep a contract at common law means a pre-diction that you must pay damages if you do not keep it,--
and nothing else." Holmes, The Path of the Law (1897), in3 The Collected Works of Justice Holmes 391, 394 (S. Novick

ed. 1995). See Horwitz-Matthews, Inc. v. Chicago, 78 F. 3d1248, 1250-1251 (CA7 1996).

In this case, it was an unquestionably sovereign act ofgovernment--enactment and implementation of provisions
of FIRREA regarding treatment of regulatory capital--that
gave rise to respondents' claims of breach of contract.Those claims were premised on the assertion that, in the

course of entering into various agreements with respond-ents, the Government had undertaken to continue certain
regulatory policies with respect to respondents' recently ac-quired thrifts; and the Government countered that assertion,
in classic fashion, with the primary defense that contractual
restrictions on sovereign authority will be recognized only
where unmistakably expressed. The "unmistakability" doctrine has been applied to precisely this sort of situation--
where a sovereign act is claimed to deprive a party of the
benefits of a prior bargain with the government. See, e. g.,
Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U. S. 130, 135-136,
145-148 (1982).

Like The Chief Justice, see post, at 924-931, I believe
that the unmistakability doctrine applies here, but unlike
him I do not think it forecloses respondents' claims. In my
view, the doctrine has little if any independent legal force
beyond what would be dictated by normal principles of
contract interpretation. It is simply a rule of presumed
(or implied-in-fact) intent. Generally, contract law imposes
upon a party to a contract liability for any impossibility of
performance that is attributable to that party's own actions.
That is a reasonable estimation of what the parties intend.
When I promise to do x in exchange for your doing y, I impliedly promise not to do anything that will disable me from
doing x, or disable you from doing y--so that if either of our
performances is rendered impossible by such an act on my
part, I am not excused from my obligation. When the contracting party is the government, however, it is simply not
reasonable to presume an intent of that sort. To the con518US3$90k 05-29-99 19:20:29 PAGES OPINPGT

921Cite as: 518 U. S. 839 (1996)
Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
trary, it is reasonable to presume (unless the opposite clearly
appears) that the sovereign does not promise that none of
its multifarious sovereign acts, needful for the public good,will incidentally disable it or the other party from performing one of the promised acts. The requirement of unmistakability embodies this reversal of the normal reasonablepresumption. Governments do not ordinarily agree to curtail their sovereign or legislative powers, and contracts mustbe interpreted in a commonsense way against that background understanding.Here, however, respondents contend that they have overcome this reverse presumption that the Government remains
free to make its own performance impossible through its
manner of regulation. Their claim is that the Government
quite plainly promised to regulate them in a particular fashion, into the future. They say that the very subject matter
of these agreements, an essential part of the quid pro quo,
was Government regulation; unless the Government is bound
as to that regulation, an aspect of the transactions that reasonably must be viewed as a sine qua non of their assent
becomes illusory. I think they are correct. If, as the dissent believes, the Government committed only "to provide
[certain] treatment unless and until there is subsequent action," post, at 935, then the Government in effect said "we
promise to regulate in this fashion for as long as we choose
to regulate in this fashion"--which is an absolutely classic
description of an illusory promise. See 1 R. Lord, Williston
on Contracts $ 1:2, p. 11 (4th ed. 1990). In these circumstances, it is unmistakably clear that the promise to accord
favorable regulatory treatment must be understood as (unsurprisingly) a promise to accord favorable regulatory treatment. I do not accept that unmistakability demands that
there be a further promise not to go back on the promise to
accord favorable regulatory treatment.

The dissent says that if the Government agreed to accord
the favorable regulatory treatment "in the short term, but

518US3$90k 05-29-99 19:20:29 PAGES OPINPGT
922 UNITED STATES v. WINSTAR CORP.

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
made no commitment about . . . the long term, respondentsstill received consideration."

Post, at 935. That is true
enough, but it is quite impossible to construe these contractsas providing for only "short term" favorable treatment, with

the long term up for grabs: Either there was an undertaking
to regulate respondents as agreed for the specified amortiza-tion periods, or there was no promise regarding the future

at all--not even so much as a peppercorn's worth.In sum, the special role of the agencies, and the terms and
circumstances of the transactions, provide an adequate basisfor saying that the promises that the trial court and the
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found to have been
made in these cases were unmistakable ones. To be sure,
those courts were not looking for "unmistakable" promises,
see post, at 936, but unmistakability is an issue of law that
we can determine here. It was found below that the Government had plainly made promises to regulate in a certain
fashion, into the future; I agree with those findings, and I
would conclude, for the reasons set forth above, that the
promises were unmistakable. Indeed, it is hard to imagine
what additional assurance that the course of regulation
would not change could have been demanded--other than,
perhaps, the Government's promise to keep its promise.
That is not what the doctrine of unmistakability requires.
While it is true enough, as the dissent points out, that one
who deals with the Government may need to " `turn square
corners,' " post, at 937 (quoting Rock Island, A. & L. R. Co.
v. United States, 254 U. S. 141, 143 (1920)), he need not turn
them twice.

The Government's remaining arguments are, I think,
readily rejected. The scope and force of the "reserved powers" and "express delegation" defenses--which the principal
opinion thinks inapplicable based on its view of the nature of
the contracts at issue here, see ante, at 888-890--have not
been well defined by our prior cases. The notion of "reserved powers" seems to stand principally for the proposi518US3$90k 05-29-99 19:20:29 PAGES OPINPGT

923Cite as: 518 U. S. 839 (1996)
Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
tion that certain core governmental powers cannot be sur-rendered, see,

e. g., Stone v. Mississippi, 101 U. S. 814 (1880);
thus understood, that doctrine would have no force where,as here, the private party to the contract does not seek to

stay the exercise of sovereign authority, but merely requests
damages for breach of contract. To the extent this Courthas suggested that the notion of "reserved powers" contemplates, under some circumstances, nullification of even mone-tary governmental obligations pursuant to exercise of "the
federal police power or some other paramount power,"
Lynch v. United States, 292 U. S. 571, 579 (1934), I do not
believe that regulatory measures designed to minimize what
are essentially assumed commercial risks are the sort of "police power" or "paramount power" referred to. And whatever is required by the "express delegation" doctrine is to
my mind satisfied by the statutes which the principal opinion
identifies as conferring upon the various federal bank regulatory agencies involved in this case authority to enter into
agreements of the sort at issue here, see ante, at 890-891.

Finally, in my view the Government cannot escape its obligations by appeal to the so-called "sovereign acts" doctrine.
That doctrine was first articulated in Court of Claims cases,
and has apparently been applied by this Court in only a single case, our 3-page opinion in Horowitz v. United States,
267 U. S. 458, decided in 1925 and cited only once since, in a
passing reference, see Nortz v. United States, 294 U. S. 317,

327 (1935). Horowitz holds that "the United States when
sued as a contractor cannot be held liable for an obstruction
to the performance of [a] particular contract resulting from
its public and general acts as a sovereign." 267 U. S., at 461.
In my view the "sovereign acts" doctrine adds little,
if anything at all, to the "unmistakability" doctrine, and
is avoided whenever that one would be--i. e., whenever it is
clear from the contract in question that the Government was
committing itself not to rely upon its sovereign acts in asserting (or defending against) the doctrine of impossibility,

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
which is another way of saying that the Government hadassumed the risk of a change in its laws. That this is the

correct interpretation of Horowitz is made clear, I think, byour two principal cases of this century holding that the Government may not simply repudiate its contractual obliga-tions,

Lynch v. United States, supra, and Perry v. UnitedStates, 294 U. S. 330 (1935). Those cases, which are barely

discussed in the principal opinion, failed even to mentionHorowitz. In both of them, as here, Congress specifically
set out to abrogate the essential bargain of the contractsat issue--and in both we declared such abrogation to amount
to impermissible repudiation. See Lynch, supra, at 578-580;

Perry, supra, at 350-354.For the foregoing reasons, I concur in the judgment.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins as to Parts I, III, and IV, dissenting.

The principal opinion works sweeping changes in two re-lated areas of the law dealing with government contracts.

It drastically reduces the scope of the unmistakability doc-trine, shrouding the residue with clouds of uncertainty, and
it limits the sovereign acts doctrine so that it will have virtu-ally no future application. I respectfully dissent.

I
The principal opinion properly recognizes that the un-mistakability doctrine is a "special rule" of government

contracting which provides, in essence, a "canon of contractconstruction that surrenders of sovereign authority must appear in unmistakable terms." Ante, at 860. Exercises ofthe sovereign authority include of course the power to tax
and, relevant to this case, the authority to regulate.The most recent opinion of this Court dealing with the
unmistakability doctrine is United States v. Cherokee Nation
of Okla., 480 U. S. 700 (1987). That case quoted languagefrom Bowen v. Public Agencies Opposed to Social Security

Entrapment, 477 U. S. 41 (1986), which relied on Merrion v.
Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U. S. 130, 148 (1982), and Merrion, in turn, quoted the much earlier case of St. Louis v.
United Railways Co., 210 U. S. 266 (1908). St. Louis involved an agreement by the city to grant street railway companies use and occupancy of the streets, in exchange for spec-ified consideration which included an annual license fee

of $25 for each car used. Id., at 272. When the city laterpassed an ordinance amending the license tax and imposing
an additional tax based on the number of passengers ridingeach car, the railway companies challenged that amendment
as a violation of the Contracts Clause. The Court there said
that such a governmental power to tax resides in the city
"unless this right has been specifically surrendered in terms
which admit of no other reasonable interpretation." Id.,
at 280.

Merrion, supra, was similar, but involved the sovereignty
of an Indian Tribe. The Tribe had allowed oil companies to
extract oil and natural gas deposits on the reservation land
in exchange for the usual cash bonus, royalties, and rents to
the Tribe. The Court found that, in so contracting, the
Tribe had not surrendered its power to impose subsequently
a severance tax on that production. Merrion explains that
"[w]ithout regard to its source[--be it federal, state, local
government, or Indian--]sovereign power, even when unexercised, is an enduring presence that governs all contracts
subject to the sovereign's jurisdiction, and will remain intact
unless surrendered in unmistakable terms." 455 U. S., at
148.

Next, Bowen, supra, addressed Congress' repeal of a law
that had once allowed States which contracted to bring their
employees into the Federal Social Security System, to terminate that agreement and their participation upon due notice.
Bowen, therefore, considered not the imposition of a tax as
St. Louis and Merrion, but an amendment to a statutory
provision that existed as a background rule when and under

which the contracts were formed--much like this case. The
Bowen Court repeated the quoted language from Merrion,
and reminded that "contractual arrangements, includingthose to which a sovereign itself is a party, `remain subject

to subsequent legislation' by the sovereign." Bowen, supra,
at 52 (quoting Merrion, supra, at 147).Finally, we have

Cherokee Nation, supra, in which the
Court applied the unmistakability doctrine to a treaty, ratherthan a typical contract. Under the treaty the United States

had granted to an Indian Tribe fee simple title to a riverbed.The Tribe claimed that the United States had not reserved
its navigational servitude and hence that the Government's
construction of a navigational channel that destroyed the
riverbed's mineral interests was a taking under the Fifth
Amendment without just compensation. The Court ruled
that the treaty had not provided the Tribe an exemption
from the navigational servitude, quoting from Bowen and
Merrion the statement that "[s]uch a waiver of sovereign
authority will not be implied, but instead must be ` "surrendered in unmistakable terms." ' " Id., at 707.

These cases have stood until now for the well-understood
proposition just quoted above--a waiver of sovereign authority will not be implied, but instead must be surrendered in
unmistakable terms. Today, however, the principal opinion
drastically limits the circumstances under which the doctrine
will apply by drawing a distinction never before seen in our
case law. The principal opinion tells us the unmistakability
doctrine will apply where a plaintiff either seeks injunctive
relief to hold the Government to its alleged surrender of sovereign authority (which generally means granting the plaintiff an exemption to the changed law), or seeks a damages
award which would be "the equivalent of " such an injunction
or exemption. Ante, at 879-880. But the doctrine will not
apply where a plaintiff seeks an award for damages caused by
the exercise of that sovereign authority. We are told that if
the alleged agreement is not one to bind the Government to

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
refrain from exercising regulatory authority, but is one toshift the risk of a change in regulatory rules, the unmistakability doctrine does not apply. And, perhaps more remarkable,the principal opinion tells us that the Government will virtually always have assumed this risk in the regulatory context,
by operation of law. Ante, at 869-870, 905-906.The first problem with the principal opinion's formulation is

a practical one. How do we know whether "the award of dam-ages" will be "the equivalent of [an] exemption,"

ante, at 879-
880, before we assess the damages? In this case, for example,"there has been no demonstration that awarding damages

for breach would be tantamount" to an exemption to the regulatory change, ante, at 881; and there has been no demonstration to the contrary either. Thus we do not know in this
very case whether the award of damages would "amount to"
an injunction, ante, at 882. If it did, under the principal opinion's theory, the unmistakability doctrine would apply, and
that application may preclude respondents' claim.

But even if we could solve that problem by determining
the damages before liability, and by finding the award to be
some amount other than the cost of an exemption, we would
still be left with a wholly unsatisfactory distinction. Few, if
any, of the plaintiffs in the unmistakability-doctrine cases
would have insisted on an injunction, exemption, or their
damages equivalent if they had known they could have
avoided the doctrine by claiming the Government had agreed
to assume the risk, and asking for an award of damages for
breaching that implied agreement. It is impossible to know
the monetary difference between such awards and, as the
principal opinion suggests, the award for a breach of the
risk-shifting agreement may even be more generous.

The principal opinion's newly minted distinction is not only
untenable, but is contrary to our decisions in Cherokee Nation and Bowen. The Cherokee Nation sought damages and
compensation for harm resulting from the Government's navigational servitude. Cherokee Nation, 480 U. S., at 701.

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
Indeed, one of the Tribe's arguments, upheld by the Courtof Appeals, was that the United States could exercise its

navigational servitude under the treaty, but that the Tribehad a right to compensation for any diminution in the value
of its riverbed property.

Likewise, some of the plaintiffs in Bowen sought damages.They sought just compensation for the revocation of their

alleged contractual right to terminate the employees' partici-pation in the Social Security Program. The District Court
in the decision which we reviewed in fact commented, as thisCourt reported, that it found that the " `only rational compensation would be reimbursement by the United States to
the State or public agencies, of the amount of money they
currently pay to the United States for their participation.' "
Bowen, 477 U. S., at 51 (quoting Public Agencies Opposed
to Social Security Entrapment v. Heckler, 613 F. Supp.
558, 575 (ED Cal. 1985)). It was only because the District
Court concluded that awarding this "measure of damages"
was contradictory to the will of Congress that the court refrained from making such an award and instead simply
declared the statutory amendment unconstitutional. 477
U. S., at 51. Neither Cherokee Nation nor Bowen hinted
that the unmistakability doctrines applied in their case because the damages remedy sought "amount[ed] to" an injunction. Ante, at 882.

In St. Louis v. United Railways Co., 210 U. S. 266 (1908),
the plaintiff railway companies did seek to enjoin the enforcement of the tax by the city, and perhaps that case fits
neatly within the principal opinion's scaled-down version of
the unmistakability doctrine. But sophisticated lawyers in
the future, litigating a claim exactly like the one in St. Louis,
need only claim that the sovereign implicitly agreed not to
change their tax treatment, and request damages for breach
of that agreement. There will presumably be no unmistakability doctrine to contend with, and they will be in the same
position as if they had successfully enjoined the tax. Such

a result has an Alice in Wonderland aspect to it, which sug-gests the distinction upon which it is based is a fallacious one.

The principal opinion justifies its novel departure fromexisting law by noting that the contracts involved in the
present case--unlike those in Merrion, Bowen, and Cherokee
Nation--"do not purport to bind the Congress from enactingregulatory measures."

Ante, at 881. But that is precisely
what the unmistakability doctrine, as a canon of construc-tion, is designed to determine:

Did the contract surrender
the authority to enact or amend regulatory measures as tothe contracting party? If the sovereign did surrender its

power unequivocally, and the sovereign breached that agreement to surrender, then and only then would the issue of
remedy for that breach arise.

The second reason the principal opinion advances for its
limitation on the unmistakability doctrine is that if it were
applied to all actions for damages, it would impair the Government's ability to enter into contracts. But the law is well
established that Congress may not simply abrogate a statutory provision obligating performance without breaching the
contract and rendering itself liable for damages. See Lynch
v. United States, 292 U. S. 571, 580 (1934); Bowen, supra, at
52. Equally well established, however, is that the sovereign
does not shed its sovereign powers just because it contracts.
See Providence Bank v. Billings, 4 Pet. 514, 565 (1830). The
Government's contracting authority has survived from the
beginning of the Nation with no diminution in bidders, so far
as I am aware, without the curtailment of the unmistakability doctrine announced today.

The difficulty caused by the principal opinion's departure
from existing law is best shown by its own analysis of the
contracts presently before us. The principal opinion tells us
first that "[n]othing in the documentation or the circumstances of these transactions purported to bar the Government from changing the way in which it regulated the thrift
industry." Ante, at 868. But, it agrees with the finding of

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
the Federal Circuit, that " `the Bank Board and the FSLICwere contractually bound to recognize the supervisory goodwill and the amortization periods reflected' in the agree-ments between the parties." Ibid.* From this finding, the
principal opinion goes on to say that "[w]e read this promiseas the law of contracts has always treated promises to provide something beyond the promisor's absolute control, thatis, as a promise to insure the promisee against loss arising
from the promised condition's nonoccurrence." Ante, at868-869. Then, in a footnote, the opinion concedes that "[t]o
be sure, each side could have eliminated any serious contestabout the correctness of their interpretive positions by using
clearer language." Ante, at 869, n. 15.But if there is a "serious contest" about the correctness of
their interpretive positions, surely the unmistakability doc-trine--a canon of construction--has a role to play in resolving that contest. And the principal opinion's reading of ad-ditional terms into the contract so that the contract contains
an unstated, additional promise to insure the promiseeagainst loss arising from the promised condition's nonoccurrence seems the very essence of a promise implied in law,which is not even actionable under the Tucker Act, rather
than a promise implied in fact, which is. See Hercules, Inc.v.

United States, 516 U. S. 417, 423 (1996).At any rate, the unmistakability doctrine never comes into

play, according to the principal opinion, because we cannotknow whether the damages which could be recovered in later
proceedings would be akin to a rebate of a tax, and thereforethe "equivalent of " an injunction. This approach tosses to
the winds any idea of the unmistakability doctrine as a canonof construction; if a canon of construction cannot come into
play until the contract has first been interpreted as to liabil*Of course it must be remembered that the Federal Circuit had also
said that the unmistakability doctrine does not apply where damages are
being sought, an approach that even the principal opinion cannot expressly endorse.

ity by an appellate court, and remanded for computation ofdamages, it is no canon of construction at all.

The principal opinion's search for some unifying theme forsomewhat similar cases from Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87,
in 1810, to the present day is an interesting intellectual exer-cise, but its practical fruit is inedible.

II
The principal opinion also makes major changes in the ex-isting sovereign acts doctrine which render the doctrine a

shell. The opinion formally acknowledges the classic state-ment of the doctrine in

Horowitz v. United States, 267 U. S.458 (1925), quoting: " `[i]t has long been held by the Court of

Claims that the United States when sued as a contractorcannot be held liable for an obstruction of the performance
of the particular contract resulting from its public and gen-eral acts as a sovereign.' "

Ante, at 892 (quoting 267 U. S.,at 461). The principal opinion says that this statement cannot be taken at face value, however, because it reads "theessential point" of Horowitz to be "to put the Government
in the same position that it would have enjoyed as a privatecontractor." Ante, at 892; see also ante, at 893 (Horowitz
emphasized "the need to treat the Government-as-contractorthe same as a private party"). But neither

Horowitz, northe Court of Claims cases upon which it relies, confine themselves to so narrow a rule. As the quotations from them inthe principal opinion show, the early cases emphasized the
dual roles of Government, as contractor and as sovereign.See, e. g., Deming v. United States, 1 Ct. Cl. 190, 191 (1865)
("The United States as a contractor are not responsible forthe United States as a lawgiver"). By minimizing the role
of lawgiver and expanding the role as private contractor,the principal opinion has thus casually, but improperly, reworked the sovereign acts doctrine.The principal opinion further cuts into the sovereign acts
doctrine by defining the "public and general" nature of an

932 UNITED STATES v. WINSTAR CORP.

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
act as depending on the government's motive for enacting it.The new test is to differentiate between "regulatory legislation that is relatively free of Government self-interest" and"statutes tainted by a governmental object of self-relief."
Ante, at 896. We are then elevated to a higher jurisprudential level by reference to the general philosophical principlesenunciated in

Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516, 535-536
(1884), that "[l]aw . . . must be not a special rule for a particu-lar person or a particular case, but . . . `the general law . . .'

so `that every citizen shall hold his life, liberty, property andimmunities under the protection of the general rules which
govern society.' " Surely this marks a bold, if not brash, innovation in the heretofore somewhat mundane law of government contracts; that law is now to be seasoned by an
opinion holding that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not make applicable to the States the
requirement that a criminal proceeding be initiated by indictment of a grand jury.

The principal opinion does not tell us, nor do these lofty
jurisprudential principles inform us, how we are to decide
whether a particular statute is "free of governmental selfinterest," on the one hand, or "tainted by" a government
objective of "self-relief," on the other. In the normal sense
of the word, any tax reform bill which tightens or closes tax
loopholes is directed to "government self-relief," since it is
designed to put more money into the public coffers. Be the
act ever so general in its reform of the tax laws, it apparently
would not be a "sovereign act" allowing the Government to
defend against a claim by a taxpayer that he had received
an interpretation from the Internal Revenue Service that
a particular type of income could continue to be treated in
accordance with existing statutes or regulations.

But we are told "self-relief " is not, as one might expect,
necessarily determined by whether the Government benefited financially from the legislation. For example, in this
case the principal opinion acknowledges that we do not know

"the dollar value of the relief the Government would obtain"if respondents had to comply with the modified capitalinfusion requirements. Ante, at 900. Rather the opinionconcludes that FIRREA, the law involved in this case,
was "tainted by" self-relief based on "the attention" that
Congressmen "[gave] to the regulatory contracts prior topassage" of the Act.

Ibid.
Indeed, judging from the principal opinion's use of com-ments of individual legislators in connection with the enactment of FIRREA, it would appear that the sky is the limitso far as judicial inquiries into the question whether the
statute was "free of governmental self-interest" or rather
"tainted" by a Government objective of "self-relief." It is
difficult to imagine a more unsettling doctrine to insert
into the law of Government contracts. By fusing the roles
of the Government as lawgiver and as contractor--exactly
what Horowitz warned against doing--the principal opinion
makes some sort of legislative intent critical in deciding
these questions. When it enacted FIRREA was the Government interested in saving its own money, or was it interested in preserving the savings of those who had money invested in the failing thrifts?

I think it preferable, rather than either importing great
natural-law principles or probing legislators' intent to modify
the sovereign acts doctrine, to leave that law where it is.
Lynch stands for the proposition that the congressional repeal of a statute authorizing the payment of money pursuant
to a contractual agreement is a breach of that contract. But,
as the term "public and general" implies, a more general regulatory enactment--whether it be the Legal Tender Acts involved in Deming, supra, or the embargo on shipments of
silk by freight involved in Horowitz--cannot by its enforcement give rise to contractual liability on the part of the
Government.

Judged by these standards, FIRREA was a general regulatory enactment. It is entitled "[a]n [a]ct to reform, recapi518US3$90h 05-29-99 19:20:29 PAGES OPINPGT

talize, and consolidate the Federal deposit insurance system,to enhance the regulatory and enforcement powers of federal

financial institutions regulatory agencies, and for other pur-poses." 103 Stat. 183. As the principal opinion itself explains, "FIRREA made enormous changes in the structureof federal thrift regulation by (1) abolishing FSLIC and
transferring its functions to other agencies; (2) creating anew thrift deposit insurance fund under the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation; (3) replacing the Bank Board with theOffice of Thrift Supervision . . . ; and (4) establishing the Resolution Trust Corporation to liquidate or otherwise dispose ofcertain closed thrifts and their assets."

Ante, at 856 (empha-sis added). The Act occupies 372 pages in the Statutes at

Large, and under 12 substantive titles contains more than 150numbered sections. Among those sections are the ones involved in the present case. Insofar as this comprehensive en-actment regulated the use of goodwill, it did so without respect
to how closely the savings association was regulated; its provi-sions dealt with the right of

any thrift association, after thedate of its enactment, to count intangible assets as capital.

See 12 U. S. C. $$ 1464(t)(1)(A), (2), (3), (9). And by these pro-visions, the capital standards of thrifts were brought into line
with those applicable to national banks. See $ 1464(t)(1)(C).The principal opinion does not dispute that Congress, through
this mammoth legislation, "acted to protect the public."
Ante, at 903. III

Justice Scalia finds that the unmistakability doctrinedoes apply to the contracts before us. He explains that
when the government is a contracting party, "it is reasonableto presume . . . that the sovereign does

not promise thatnone of its multifarious sovereign acts . . . will incidentally

disable it or the other party from performing," under thecontract, "unless the opposite clearly appears." Ante, at
921. In other words, the sovereign's right to take subse-quent action continues "unless th[e] right has been specifi518US3$90h 05-29-99 19:20:29 PAGES OPINPGT

cally surrendered in terms which admit of no other reason-able interpretation."

St. Louis, 210 U. S., at 280. Justice
Scalia finds that the presumption has been rebutted here;he, like

Justice Breyer, finds that the Government had
made a promise that its subsequent action would not frustrate the contract. Justice Scalia, however, finds thatobligation is contained implicitly within the "promis[e] to

regulate . . . in a particular fashion," and the Government'sconsideration.

Ante, at 921.
But that is hardly what one normally thinks to be "unmis-takable terms." Indeed, that promise plus consideration is

no different from what Justice Scalia says applies to private parties. Ante, at 920. The Government has "promise[d] to do x in exchange for [respondents] doing y," and in
so doing "impliedly promise[d] not to do anything that
[would] disable [the Government] from doing x, or disable
[respondents] from doing y--so that if either of [the parties'] performances is rendered impossible by such an act on
[the Government's] part, [the Government is] not excused
from [its] obligation." Ibid. (emphasis added). But more
than this is required for Government contracts, as Justice
Scalia had seemed to acknowledge.

His point about quid pro quo adds little, for it necessarily
assumes that there has been a promise to provide a particular regulatory treatment which cannot be affected by
subsequent action, as opposed to a promise to provide that
treatment unless and until there is subsequent action.
Ante, at 921. But determining which promise the Government has made is precisely what the unmistakability doctrine is designed to determine. If the Government agreed
to treat the losses acquired by respondents as supervisory
goodwill in the short term, but made no commitment about
their regulatory treatment over the long term, respondents
still received consideration. Such consideration would be
especially valuable to an unhealthy thrift because it would
provide "a number of immediate benefits to the acquiring

thrift" that would stave off foreclosure. Brief for UnitedStates 27.

In addition, Justice Scalia does not himself make thefindings necessary for respondents to prevail, but relies on
the findings of the trial court and the Court of Appeals forthe Federal Circuit with respect to what the Government
actually promised. Ante, at 922. But both the trial courtand the Court of Appeals held the unmistakability doctrine
did no t apply here. Therefore, even under Justice
Scalia's own premises, these findings are insufficient be-cause they were made under a mistaken view of the applicable law. IV

Justice Breyer in his separate concurrence follows a dif-ferent route to the result reached by the principal opinion.
But even under his own view of the law, he omits a necessarystep in the reasoning required to hold the Government liable.
He says that "the lower courts held that each [respondent]proved the existence of an express promise by the Government to grant them particular regulatory treatment for aperiod of years."

Ante, at 913. But the Government couldhave made that promise and not made the further promise

to pay respondents in the event that the regulatory regimechanged.

Justice Breyer concludes that second promisedid exist as a matter of fact, but he never makes that finding

himself. Instead, he says that the "principal opinion's care-ful examination of the circumstances reveals" that the Government did "inten[d] to make a binding promise . . . to holdthe thrifts harmless from the effects of future regulation (or
legislation)." Ante, at 918. But the principal opinion doesnot treat this as a question of fact at all, as

Justice Breyerdoes, but instead as something which occurs by operation

of law.

Justice Breyer relies on this illusory factual findingwhile at the same time commenting how implausible it would

be for the Government to have intended to insure against a

change in the law. He notes that "it might seem unlikely"for the Government to make such a promise, ibid., and further comments that because the contracting party is theGovernment, it may be "far less likely that [the parties] intend[ed] to make a promise that will oblige the Governmentto hold private parties harmless in the event of a change in
the law," ante, at 913.The short of the matter is that

Justice Breyer and Justice Scalia cannot reach their desired result, any more thanthe principal opinion can, without changing the status of the

Government to just another private party under the law ofcontracts. But 75 years ago Justice Holmes, speaking for
the Court in Rock Island, A. & L. R. Co. v. United States,254 U. S. 141, 143 (1920), said that "[m]en must turn square
corners when they deal with the Government." The state-ment was repeated in Federal Crop Ins. Corp. v. Merrill, 332
U. S. 380, 385 (1947). The wisdom of this principle arises,not from any ancient privileges of the sovereign, but from
the necessity of protecting the federal fisc--and the taxpay-ers who foot the bills--from possible improvidence on the
part of the countless Government officials who must be au-thorized to enter into contracts for the Government.

V
A moment's reflection suggests that the unmistakabilitydoctrine and the sovereign acts doctrine are not entirely separate principles. To the extent that the unmistakabilitydoctrine is faithfully applied, the cases will be rare in which
close and debatable situations under the sovereign acts doc-trine are presented. I do not believe that respondents met
either of these tests, and I would reverse the judgment ofthe Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit outright or remand the case to that court for reconsideration in light ofthese tests as I have enunciated them.

Per Curiam

PENNSYLVANIA v. LABRON
on petition for writ of certiorari to the supremecourt of pennsylvania

No. 95-1691. Decided July 1, 1996*
In No. 95-1691, police found cocaine when they searched the trunk of

respondent Labron's car after observing him and others engaging in
drug transactions on a Philadelphia street. In No. 95-1738, a search of
respondent Kilgore's truck during a drug raid on his home turned up
cocaine. In both cases, probable cause existed for the searches, but
the police did not obtain warrants. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court
suppressed the evidence seized in each case, holding that the Fourth
Amendment requires police to obtain a warrant before searching an automobile unless exigent circumstances are present.

Held: The automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant

requirement requires only that there be probable cause to conduct a
search. This Court's early cases establishing the automobile exception
were based on the automobile's ready mobility, an exigency sufficient to
excuse failure to obtain a search warrant once probable cause to conduct
the search is clear. See, e. g., California v. Carney, 471 U. S. 386, 390-
391. More recent cases provide a further justification: the individual's
reduced privacy expectation in an automobile, owing to its pervasive
regulation. Ibid. This Court's jurisdiction in Labron's case is secure.
The Commonwealth's automobile exception jurisprudence appears to be
interwoven with federal law, and the adequacy and independence of any
possible state-law ground for the exception is not clear from the face
of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's opinion. Michigan v. Long, 463
U. S. 1032, 1040-1041. Since the opinion in Kilgore's case rests on the
explicit conclusion that the officers' conduct violated the Fourth Amendment, this Court has jurisdiction to review that judgment as well.

Certiorari granted; No. 95-1691, 543 Pa. 86, 669 A. 2d 917, and No. 95-

1738, 544 Pa. 439, 677 A. 2d 311, reversed and remanded.

before searching an automobile unless exigent circumstancesare present. Because the holdings rest on an incorrect reading of the automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment'swarrant requirement, we grant the petitions for certiorari
and reverse.

In Labron, No. 95-1691, police observed respondent La-bron and others engaging in a series of drug transactions on

a street in Philadelphia. The police arrested the suspects,searched the trunk of a car from which the drugs had been
produced, and found bags containing cocaine. The Pennsyl-vania Supreme Court agreed with the trial court (but not
with the intermediate court of appeals, 428 Pa. Super. 616,626 A. 2d 646 (1993), whose judgment it reversed) that this
evidence should be suppressed. 543 Pa. 86, 669 A. 2d 917
(1995). After surveying our precedents on the automobileexception as well as some of its own decisions, the court "conclude[d] that this Commonwealth's jurisprudence of the auto-mobile exception has long required both the existence of
probable cause and the presence of exigent circumstances tojustify a warrantless search."

Id., at 100, 669 A. 2d, at 924.
Satisfied the police had time to secure a warrant, id., at 100-103, 699 A. 2d, at 924-925, the court held that "the warrantless search of this stationary vehicle violated constitutional
guarantees," id., at 101, 669 A. 2d, at 924.

In Kilgore, No. 95-1738, an undercover informant agreed
to buy drugs from respondent Randy Lee Kilgore's accomplice, Kelly Jo Kilgore. To obtain the drugs, Kelly Jo drove
from the parking lot where the deal was made to a farmhouse where she met with Randy Kilgore and obtained the
drugs. After the drugs were delivered and the Kilgores
were arrested, police searched the farmhouse with the consent of its owner and also searched Randy Kilgore's pickup
truck; they had seen the Kilgores walking to and from the
truck, which was parked in the driveway of the farmhouse.
The search turned up cocaine on the truck's floor. The trial
court denied Randy Kilgore's motion to suppress the cocaine,
holding the officers had probable cause to make the search.

The appellate court affirmed. 437 Pa. Super. 491, 650 A. 2d462 (1994). The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania reversed,

citing Labron and holding that although there was probablecause to search the truck, 544 Pa. 439, 444, 677 A. 2d 311,
313 (1995), the search violated the Fourth Amendment because no exigent circumstances justified the failure to obtaina warrant,

id., at 445, 677 A. 2d, at 313-314.
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held the rule permit-ting warrantless searches of automobiles is limited to cases

where " `unforeseen circumstances involving the search of anautomobile [are] coupled with the presence of probable
cause.' " 543 Pa., at 100, 669 A. 2d, at 924, quoting Commonwealth v. White, 543 Pa. 45, 53, 669 A. 2d 896, 901 (1995)
(emphasis deleted). This was incorrect. Our first cases establishing the automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement were based on the automobile's
"ready mobility," an exigency sufficient to excuse failure to
obtain a search warrant once probable cause to conduct the
search is clear. California v. Carney, 471 U. S. 386, 390-391
(1985) (tracing the history of the exception); Carroll v.
United States, 267 U. S. 132 (1925). More recent cases
provide a further justification: the individual's reduced expectation of privacy in an automobile, owing to its pervasive
regulation. Carney, supra, at 391-392. If a car is readily
mobile and probable cause exists to believe it contains contraband, the Fourth Amendment thus permits police to
search the vehicle without more. Carney, supra, at 393.
As the state courts found, there was probable cause in both
of these cases: Police had seen respondent Labron put drugs
in the trunk of the car they searched and had seen respondent Kilgore act in ways that suggested he had drugs in his
truck. We conclude the searches of the automobiles in these
cases did not violate the Fourth Amendment.

Respondent Labron claims we have no jurisdiction to review the judgment in his case because the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court's opinion rests on an adequate and independ518US3$91l 05-29-99 19:17:22 PAGES OPINPGT

45, 669 A. 2d 896 (1995); 543 Pa. 86, 669 A. 2d 917 (1995).1
In each case, that court concluded that citizens of Pennsylvania are protected from warrantless searches and seizures of
their automobiles absent exigent circumstances. But a fair
reading of both White (the holding of which the Commonwealth has not challenged in this Court) and Labron (which
the Court reverses today) demonstrates that their judgments almost certainly rested upon the Pennsylvania court's
independent consideration of its own Constitution. For that
reason, I do not believe that we have jurisdiction over the
decision in Labron, just as we would not have jurisdiction in
White. See 28 U. S. C. $ 1257(a).2 Furthermore, when considered in light of those two more carefully reasoned decisions, there is no reason for this Court to disturb the state
court's finding in Kilgore, since the result will almost certainly be affirmed on remand.

In its per curiam decision, this Court concludes that because the decision in Labron cited state decisions which in
turn referred to two 25-year-old cases of this Court, any reference to state law is " `interwoven with the federal law.' "
Ante, at 941 (quoting Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1040
(1983)). These references, however, seem to me a rather
short thread with which to weave--let alone upon which to
hang--our jurisdiction.

1 Each decision was issued by a different division of the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court.

2 Even if, as the Court concludes, ante, at 941, some element of residual

doubt suggests that Pennsylvania's Supreme Court drew inspiration from
our interpretations of the Federal Constitution, I do not think that reliance sufficient to justify expending this Court's time--or that of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court--simply to scour the state decisions of all references to the Federal Constitution. See infra, at 943-950.

In my opinion, the best reading of Labron's plain languageis that it relied on adequate and independent state grounds.

The majority decision below includes references to foursources of federal law: the Federal Constitution and three
federal cases. None of the references demonstrates that the
decision rested upon anything other than state law.The decision begins with the proposition, not at issue here,

that "the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitu-tion and Article I, $ 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution generally require that searches be predicated upon a warrantissued by a neutral and detached magistrate." 543 Pa., at
93, 669 A. 2d, at 920 (citations omitted). It then reviews thehistory of the so-called "automobile exception" to the warrant requirement by quoting several passages from our decision in Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132 (1925), whichfirst established the exception, and then quotes a passage

from Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42, 52 (1970),3 whichappears to support the proposition under federal law that
the Court emphasizes here today (that the existence of prob-able cause is sufficient in and of itself to justify a search of a
vehicle). 543 Pa., at 94-95, 669 A. 2d, at 920-921.Rather than follow the developments of federal law, however, the decision then specifically and immediately notesthat "[w]hen reviewing warrantless automobile searches

in
this Commonwealth, we have constantly held that `there isno "automobile exception" as such and [that] the constitutional protections are applicable to searches and seizures of
a person's car.' Commonwealth v. Holzer, 480 Pa. 93, 103,
389 A. 2d 101, 106 (1978) (citing Coolidge v. New Hampshire,

3 As the Pennsylvania Supreme Court noted, in Chambers we held that
" `[f]or constitutional purposes, [there is] no difference between on the one
hand seizing and holding a car before presenting the probable cause issue
to a magistrate and on the other hand carrying out an immediate search
without a warrant.' " 543 Pa. 86, 95, 669 A. 2d 917, 921 (1995) (quoting
Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S., at 52).

403 U. S. 443 . . . (1971))." Id., at 95, 669 A. 2d, at 921 (em-phasis added). From that point onward, the only reference

to federal law in the decision's remaining 30 citations is arecognition that

White, the sole decision of this trio of "exigent circumstance" cases that is not before our Court, was
"based upon" that Court's analysis of Chambers. 543 Pa.,at 99-100, 669 A. 2d, at 923-924. Every other citation in

Labron is to Pennsylvania law.Because

White was issued on the same day as Labron and
reached an identical conclusion regarding the "exigentcircumstances" rule, that decision is worth reviewing. In

White, the court hesitated before considering the merits of
the case "to address the Commonwealth's claim that White
has waived his claim that the search of his automobile was
illegal under Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution because he did not set forth his state constitutional claims in the manner required." The Commonwealth's claim, the court found, was "meritless." "White
clearly raises a claim under the Pennsylvania Constitution,
cites cases in support of his claim, and relates the cases to
the claim. That is sufficient." 543 Pa., at 50, 669 A. 2d,
at 899.

Having established the importance of the state constitutional claim to the defendant's argument, White went on to
discuss the "exigent circumstance" exception at issue here in
light of both federal and state law. And although the court's
analysis relied upon our decision in Chambers v. Maroney, it
cited none of the subsequent cases in which this Court has
effectively converted the "automobile exception" into an absolute rule allowing searches in the presence of probable
cause. See 543 Pa., at 49-53, 669 A. 2d, at 899-901; n. 6,
infra (noting that the Pennsylvania courts' failure to refer to
this Court's subsequent decisions in this area may be intentional rather than ignorant). Stressing the independent
evaluation it makes of its State Constitution, the Pennsylvania court also rejected our decision in New York v. Belton,

Notably, the Commonwealth has not asked this Court toreview the Pennsylvania court's decision in White, even

though the search in that case would be affirmed under theCommonwealth's and this Court's understanding of Pennsylvania's holding regarding exigent circumstances. I alsonote that lower state courts have explicitly read

White asestablishing a state constitutional right, not a federal right.

Commonwealth v. Haskins, 450 Pa. Super. 540, 545, 677 A.2d 328, 330 (1996) ("In order to search an automobile without
a warrant, the police must still show the existence of bothprobable cause and exigent circumstances.

Commonwealth
v. White, 543 Pa. 45, 669 A. 2d 896 (1995). . . . In White, our
Supreme Court reiterated that the Pennsylvania Constitu-tion requires such a showing"); see also

Yedinak, 450 Pa. Super. 352, 359, n. 5, 676 A. 2d 1217, 1220,n. 5 (1996) ("The Pennsylvania Supreme Court recently held

that the Pennsylvania Constitution provides greater protec-tion than the United States Constitution with regard to automobile searches in Commonwealth v. White").

The lower courts' understanding regarding the state-lawnature of

White--and my understanding of the state-law nature of Labron as well--is almost perfectly reflected in thedissents to each case that were penned by Justice Castille.

In both instances, Justice Castille recognizes, even moreexplicitly than the majority, that the decisions were based
on state law.In

Labron, for instance, his main point was that the defendant had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of

4 Although the court's main opinion in Commonwealth v. White also
asked whether the search would have been permissible as a search incident to an arrest, the dissent later noted that the only question presented
in the appeal was whether "exigent circumstances" were necessary to permit a warrantless search of a car based on probable cause. See 543 Pa.,
at 72-73, 669 A. 2d, at 910.

the search of a car that he did not own. In making his argu-ment, however, he noted that "the majority correctly characterizes Pennsylvania law regarding the `automobile excep-tion' to the warrant requirement." 543 Pa., at 104, 669 A.
2d, at 926 (emphasis added). And although he reviewed de-cisions of this Court on standing to claim violations of the
Fourth Amendment, he went on to note: "Under Article I,
Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, however, thisCourt looks to several additional factors to determine

whether a criminal defendant has standing to challenge theadmission of evidence against him." Id., at 106, 669 A. 2d,
at 927 (emphasis added).In

White, Justice Castille stated that he believed that "theautomobile exception to the warrant requirements of this

Commonwealth should be a per se rule regardless of howmuch time police may have to obtain a warrant," 543 Pa., at
70, 669 A. 2d, at 909 (emphasis added), and he further con-cluded that he would "urge the adoption of a bright line rule
that would allow warrantless searches of all automobiles forwhich police have independent probable cause,"

id., at 71,669 A. 2d, at 909-910. Of course, if Justice Castille were

interpreting federal, rather than state, law, he would nothave the luxury of "urging the adoption" of a particular rule.

5

Having reviewed the range of the Pennsylvania courts'statements regarding the source of the "exigent circumstances" rule, it is worthwhile to review this Court's under-standing of when a state decision is based on adequate and
independent state grounds. In Michigan v. Long, the Courtadopted a "plain statement" rule for determining whether a
state decision rested on "independent and adequate" state-law grounds. "[B]ecause of [our] respect for state courts,

5 Justice Castille also specifically noted that the Belton decision was not
raised by the parties, and that the majority's discussion of it was dicta,
further emphasizing that his emphasis on Pennsylvania law was related to
the sole issue that he believed presented: whether a warrantless search of
an automobile requires both probable cause and an exigent circumstance.

and [a] desire to avoid advisory opinions, . . . we [did] notwish to continue to decide issues of state law that go beyond

the opinion that we review, or to require state courts to re-consider cases to clarify the grounds of their decisions." 463
U. S., at 1040. When "a state court decision fairly appearsto rest

primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven withthe federal law, and when the adequacy and independence of

any possible state law ground is not clear from the face ofthe opinion," we held, we would conclude that the State decided as it did because federal law required it to do so. Id.,at 1040-1041.

Given the explicit and nearly exclusive references to statelaw that I review above, it seems to me that the Court's
decision to take jurisdiction in Labron not only extends
Michigan v. Long beyond its original scope, but stands itsrationale on its head. Labron does not rest "primarily" on

federal law; as Justice Castille understood it, as the briefingin White understood it, and as the Commonwealth's decision
to stay out of White demonstrates, every indication is thatthe rule adopted in

Labron and White rests primarily onstate law. Nor are these holdings "interwoven" with federal

law: Both Labron and White cite only two federal cases, bothover a quarter-century old; rather than implicitly conclude
that the absence of any reference to more recent decisions isdue to poor legal research, I would trust the Pennsylvania
courts' ability to understand and choose to deviate from ourfederal law. Certainly it would be a more respectful approach, in a case where the question is as close as it is in thiscase, to conclude that the State had made a conscious decision to depart from the jurisprudence of this Court ratherthan an error of law.

a limited expectation of privacy in an automobile independently under the
Pennsylvania Constitution. Therefore, the question before us today is not

Stevens, J., dissenting
The nature of the Pennsylvania court's reliance on federal
law in these cases, therefore, is quite different from that
which spurred the Court to conclude in Michigan v. Long
that the judgment of the Michigan Supreme Court had not
relied on adequate and independent state grounds. There,
as the Court noted, the decision below "referred twice to
the State Constitution in its opinion, but otherwise relied
exclusively on federal law." 463 U. S., at 1037 (emphasis

but whether we wish to follow the United States Supreme Court and
sharply curtail a privacy interest long recognized by this Court." Commonwealth v. White, 543 Pa., at 62, 669 A. 2d, at 905.

To this end, I find it particularly interesting that only two Pennsylvania
courts have cited the decision in California v. Carney, 471 U. S. 386 (1985),
upon which the per curiam decision relies as modern support for its interpretation of federal constitutional law. See Commonwealth v. Rosenfelt,
443 Pa. Super. 616, 632-634, 662 A. 2d 1131, 1139 (1995); Commonwealth
v. Camacho, 425 Pa. Super. 567, 625 A. 2d 1242 (1995). Each of those
decisions expressly noted the presence of conflict between federal and
state law on this issue.

In Camacho, the Superior Court noted "the discrepancy between some
of the Commonwealth's past cases and federal cases which speak to automobile searches" in cases like those at issue here. Id., at 576, n. 2, 625 A.
2d, at 1247, n. 2. After reviewing the holding in Carney, the court noted
that the state cases concluding that there was no per se " `automobile exception' " were "simply dated and not in keeping with the tenor of current
law." 425 Pa. Super., at 577, n. 2, 625 A. 2d, at 1247, n. 2.

The court in Rosenfelt reached an alternative explanation for the conflict--and a result identical to that reached in the cases reversed by the
Court today. There, the defendant agreed that the search of the vehicle
was not illegal under federal law. Citing Carney, the court noted that
the federal "automobile exception" had "jettison[ed]" the requirement of
exigency, essentially converting the exception into a per se rule allowing
a search once probable cause exists. See 443 Pa. Super., at 633, 644-645,
662 A. 2d, at 1139, 1145. Noting that the State Constitution could extend
greater protections to Pennsylvania citizens than did the Federal Constitution, but that its Supreme Court had not yet decided whether that was
the case, the Superior Court went on to review the issue on its own and
found a state constitutional violation. Ibid. After it decided the cases at
issue here, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied the Commonwealth's
appeal. See 544 Pa. 605, 674 A. 2d 1070 (1996) (table).

added). The dissents below also relied explicitly and exclusively on decisions of this Court. Id., at 1037, n. 2; Michigan v. Long, 413 Mich. 461, 473-486, 320 N. W. 2d 866, 870-875 (1982) (Coleman, C. J., dissenting, Moody, J., concurring

in part and dissenting in part). Indeed, the critical holding
of the Court was that the Michigan "Court of Appeals erro-neously applied the principles of

Terry v. Ohio." Id., at 471,
320 N. W. 2d, at 869 (citation omitted).7 The opinion in thesecases presents almost precisely the opposite situation: The

decision refers to the Federal Constitution once, but other-wise relies

exclusively on state law.
For these reasons, just as the decision in White would notmerit summary reversal were it before this Court, the decision in Labron should not be summarily reversed. Al-though

Labron and White both touch upon, and even place
some historical reliance upon, federal search and seizure law,
each also recognizes the broad interpretation that the Pennsylvania court has given its own constitutional prohibition
against warrantless searches. I therefore seriously ques7 On the many subsequent occasions in which this Court has taken jurisdiction over state decisions over which there was some dispute about the
nature of the relationship between federal and state law, the state opinions
were far more "interwoven" with federal law than is true in these cases.
See, e. g., Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U. S. 177, 182 (1990) (decision below
did not "rely on (or even mention) any specific provision" of State Constitution); Pennsylvania v. Muniz, 496 U. S. 582, 588, n. 4 (1990) (state constitutional provision construed to provide protections identical to Federal Constitution); Florida v. Riley, 488 U. S. 445, 448, n. 1 (1989) (decision below
mentioned State Constitution only twice, but "focused exclusively on federal cases dealing with the Fourth Amendment"); Michigan v. Chesternut,
486 U. S. 567, 571, n. 3 (1988) (decision below "said nothing to suggest that
the Michigan Constitution's seizure provision provided an independent
source of relief, and the court's entire analysis rested expressly on the
Fourth Amendment and federal cases"); Kentucky v. Stincer, 482 U. S. 730,
735, n. 7 (1987) (decision below "consistently referred to respondent's
rights under the . . . Federal Constitution as supporting its ruling"); Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U. S. 79, 83-84 (1987) (State Constitution construed

tion whether respect for the reasoning, independence, and
resources of the Pennsylvania court will be advanced by today's decision.

While Kilgore relies more explicitly on the Federal Constitution than the other two decisions, it decided the identical
issue that was decided in Labron and White only three days
before those decisions issued. The reference to the Federal
Constitution upon which the Court rests its jurisdiction--
only one of two references to federal law--must be read in
the context of the other two decisions, each of which relied
heavily upon the Commonwealth's own Constitution. In
light of Labron and White, the judgment in Kilgore will
almost certainly remain the same on remand. In such a
circumstance, the rationales supporting the rule of Michigan
v. Long simply do not support the decision to reverse. The
petition in Kilgore should simply be denied.

On many prior occasions, I have noted the unfortunate effects of the rule of Michigan v. Long. See, e. g., Harris v.
Reed, 489 U. S. 255, 266-267 (1989) (concurring opinion); Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U. S. 673, 689-708 (1986) (dissenting opinion); Montana v. Hall, 481 U. S. 400, 411 (1987) (per
curiam) (dissenting opinion); Ponte v. Real, 471 U. S. 491,
501-503 (1985) (opinion concurring in part); see also Arizona
v. Evans, 514 U. S. 1, 24, 31-34 (1995) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Because the state-law ground supporting these judgments is so much clearer than has been true on most prior
occasions, see n. 5, supra, these decisions exacerbate those
effects to a nearly intolerable degree. Particularly in light
of my understanding of this Court's primary role--"to protect the rights of the individual that are embodied in the
Federal Constitution," Harris, 489 U. S., at 267--the decision
to summarily reverse state decisions resting tenuously at
best on federal grounds is imprudent and entirely inconsistent "with the sound administration of this Court's discretionary docket." Ponte, 471 U. S., at 502-503.

Stevens, J., dissenting
The Pennsylvania court has in these and other cases expressly indicated its intent to extend the protections of its
Constitution beyond those available under the Federal Constitution, see, e. g., Commonwealth v. Edmunds, 526 Pa. 374,
586 A. 2d 887 (1991) (setting forth test for establishing rights
under Pennsylvania Constitution); Commonwealth v. Rosenfelt, 443 Pa. Super. 616, 634-637, 662 A. 2d 1131, 1140-1141
(1995) (reviewing state cases extending greater protections
under the Pennsylvania Constitution). The per curiam decision that the Court issues today merely makes that task
harder by requiring the Commonwealth to purge its decisions of any reliance on the latter, despite the value of the
insights that our decisions can provide on related issues of
law. By "unceremoniously reversing its judgment," Van
Arsdall, 475 U. S., at 701 (Stevens, J., dissenting), we also
demonstrate a lack of respect for the Pennsylvania court and
the sophistication of its state search and seizure law. See
id., at 699.

These harms are particularly unnecessary given the likely
result on remand. To reinvigorate the privacy protections
extended to Pennsylvania citizens under Labron, Kilgore,
and White, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court need only set
forth the appropriate talismanic language and state, even
more clearly than it already has, that the "Commonwealth's
jurisprudence of the automobile exception [requires] both the
existence of probable cause and the presence of exigent
circumstances to justify a warrantless search." Labron, 543
Pa., at 100, 669 A. 2d, at 924 (emphasis added).8 While the

8 State courts have, of course, done this on many occasions in the past.
See, e. g., Ponte v. Real, 471 U. S. 491, 503, n. 4 (1985) (Stevens, J., concurring in part) (listing various cases in which reversals by this Court were
followed by state-court decisions affirming the original holding on statelaw grounds); Montana v. Hall, 481 U. S. 400, 411 (1987) (per curiam)

Reported below: 54 F. 3d 261.

Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice and JusticeThomas join, dissenting.

I dissent from the decision to remand this case in light ofRomer v. Evans, 517 U. S. 620 (1996). Romer involved a state
constitutional amendment prohibiting special protection for homo-sexuals. The consequence of its holding is that homosexuals in a
city (or other electoral subunit) that wishes to accord them specialprotection cannot be compelled to achieve a state constitutional
amendment in order to have the benefit of that democratic prefer-ence. The present case, by contrast, involves a determination by
what appears to be the lowest electoral subunit that it does notwish to accord homosexuals special protection. It can make that
determination effective, of course, only by instructing its depart-ments and agencies to obey it--which is what the Cincinnati Charter Amendment does. Thus, the consequence of holding this pro-vision unconstitutional would be that nowhere in the country may
the people decide, in democratic fashion, not to accord specialprotection to homosexuals. Unelected heads of city departments
and agencies, who are in other respects (as democratic theoryrequires) subject to the control of the people, must, where special
protection for homosexuals are concerned, be permitted to dowhat they please. This is such an absurd proposition that Romer,
which did not involve the issue, cannot possibly be thought tohave embraced it.

Opinion of Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Souterjoins, respecting the denial of certiorari.
Whether it is constitutional for a public college or graduateschool to use race or national origin as a factor in its admissions

process is an issue of great national importance. The petitionbefore us, however, does not challenge the lower courts' judgments that the particular admissions procedure used by the Uni-versity of Texas Law School in 1992 was unconstitutional. Acknowledging that the 1992 admissions program "has long sincebeen discontinued and will not be reinstated," Pet. for Cert. 28,
petitioners do not defend that program in this Court, see Replyto Brief in Opposition 1, 3; see also Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 14, n. 13 ("We agree that the 1992 [admissions]policy was constitutionally flawed . . . ."). Instead, petitioners
challenge the rationale relied on by the Court of Appeals."[T]his Court," however, "reviews judgments, not opinions."
Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,467 U. S. 837, 842 (1984) (footnote omitted). Accordingly, we must
await a final judgment on a program genuinely in controversybefore addressing the important question raised in this petition.
See Reply to Brief in Opposition 2 ("[A]ll concede this record isinadequate to assess definitively" the constitutionality of the law
school's current consideration of race in its admissions process.).

ABORTION.

State law--Severability of provisions.--Tenth Circuit erred in invalidating one provision in Utah's abortion law on ground that it was not
severable from another provision that had been struck down as unconstitutional. Leavitt v. Jane L., p. 137.

Habeas corpus petitions.--Act, which makes substantial changes in habeas corpus procedures, does not preclude this Court from entertaining a
habeas petition, but does affect standards governing granting of relief.
Felker v. Turpin, p. 651.

ANTITRUST ACTS.

Sherman Act--Labors laws.--Federal labor laws shield from a Sherman
Act antitrust attack an agreement among several members of a multiemployer bargaining unit to implement after impasse terms of their last best
good-faith wage offer. Brown v. Pro Football, Inc., p. 231.

ARIZONA. See Constitutional Law, I.
AT-WILL GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. See Constitutional Law,

AUTOMOBILE SEARCHES. See Constitutional Law, IX.
BANKRUPTCY.

Priorities--Tax claim.--Government's claim for "tax" under 26 U. S. C.

$ 4971(a) is not entitled to bankruptcy priority as an "excise tax" under 11
U. S. C. $ 507(a)(7)(E), but it was error to subordinate claim to claims of

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.
I. Access to Courts.

Prisoners--Adequacy of legal research facilities.--District Court's injunction ordering sweeping changes in Arizona's prison law library and
legal assistance programs exceeds constitutional requirements for a right
of access to courts set forth in Bounds v. Smith, 430 U. S. 817, 828. Lewis
v. Casey, p. 343.

II. Double Jeopardy.

What constitutes punishment--Civil forfeitures.--Civil forfeitures do
not constitute punishment for purposes of Double Jeopardy Clause, and
thus Clause does not prohibit Government from both punishing a defendant for a criminal offense and forfeiting his property for that same offense
in a separate civil proceeding. United States v. Ursery, p. 267.

III. Due Process.

Murder trial--Accused's mental state--Effect of intoxication.--Montana Supreme Court's conclusion, that respondent was denied due process
in his murder trial when state law prohibited his voluntary intoxication
from being taken into consideration in determining existence of mental
state element of criminal offense, is reversed. Montana v. Egelhoff, p. 37.

IV. Equal Protection of the Laws.

Discrimination on basis of sex--Virginia Military Institute--Admission policy.--Virginia's categorical exclusion of women from educational
opportunities VMI provides denies equal protection to women; and Virginia's remedy--to maintain VMI as a male-only college and create a separate program for women--does not cure constitutional violation. United
States v. Virginia, p. 515.

V. Exceptions and Suspension Clauses.

Habeas corpus--Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of
1996.--Act, which makes substantial changes in habeas corpus proce518IND$$BV 03-16-99 21:13:54 PGT*INDBV (Bound Volume)

1063INDEX
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW--Continued.
dures, does not violate Exceptions Clause or Suspension Clause. Felker
v. Turpin, p. 651.

VI. Freedom of Speech.

1. Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of
1992--Leased channel operators--Segregation of offensive programming.--Section 10(b) of Act--which requires cable system operators to
segregate certain patently offensive programming, to place it on a single
channel, and to block that channel from viewer access unless viewer
requests access--violates First Amendment. Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, p. 727.

2. Independent government contractors--Retaliation for speech.--First
Amendment protections of Elrod v. Burns, 427 U. S. 347, and Branti v.
Finkel, 445 U. S. 507--that prohibit government officials from discharging public employees for refusing to support a political party or its candidate, unless political affiliation is an appropriate requirement for job in
question--extend to instances where government retaliates against a contractor for exercise of rights of political association or expression of political allegiance. O'Hare Truck Service, Inc. v. City of Northlake, p. 712.

3. Independent government contractors--Retaliation for speech.--First
Amendment protects independent contractors from termination or prevention of automatic renewal of their at-will government contracts in retaliation for their speech; and balancing test of Pickering v. Board of Ed.
of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563, adjusted to
weigh government's interests as contractor, determines that protection's
extent. Board of Comm'rs, Wabaunsee Cty. v. Umbehr, p. 668.

VII. Immunity from Suit.

Federal Government--Rehabilitation Act of 1973.--Congress has not
waived Government's sovereign immunity against monetary damages for
violations of $ 504(a) of Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits discrimination based on disability under any Executive agency program or
activity. Lane v. Pen~ a, p. 187.

VIII. Right to Jury Trial.

1. Diversity case--Application of state damages law.--New York law
controlling excessive or inadequate damages awards can be given effect
in federal courts, without detriment to Seventh Amendment right to jury
trial, if federal trial judge applies State's review standard and appellate
review is limited to abuse of discretion. Gasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc., p. 415.

2. Multiple petty offenses--Aggregate prison term.--A defendant who
is prosecuted in a single proceeding for multiple petty offenses does not
have a Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial where aggregate prison

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW--Continued.
term authorized for offenses exceeds six months. Lewis v. United States,
p. 322.

IX. Searches and Seizures.

Warrant requirement--Automobile exception.--Pennsylvania Supreme
Court misread automobile exception to Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement when it held that police must obtain a warrant before searching
a car unless exigent circumstances are present. Pennsylvania v. Labron,
p. 938.

criminal investigation and requesting that a district court depart below
minimum of applicable Guideline sentencing range does not also authorize
court to depart below a lower statutory minimum sentence. Melendez v.
United States, p. 120.

2. Sentencing range--Standard of review--Rejection of downward departure factors.--An appeals court should not review de novo a decision
to depart from Guideline sentencing range, but instead should ask whether
district court abused its discretion; Ninth Circuit erred in rejecting certain downward departure factors. Koon v. United States, p. 81.
